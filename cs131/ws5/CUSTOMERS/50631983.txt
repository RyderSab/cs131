ON BENDED KNEE: THE PRESS AND THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY is (now) a historical snapshot and a thorough analysis of that emerging picture.  The focus of attention is upon the exact relationship between (not surprisingly) the press apparatus of the Reagan Administration and the press itself.  And his conclusion -- that Reagan faced a press that rarely even thought about trying to draw blood -- is something that any Reagan supporter would find hard to argue.  After all, author Mark Hertsgaard even gets some quotes from Reagan Administration officials who basically agree with his argument. <br /> <br />ON BENDED KNEE was published in 1988 (the book mentions the on-going Presidential campaign of that year, but seems blissfully unaware of its conclusion), and the main feature separating this political book from political books of today is that there appears to have been actual research put into it.  While some modern books seem content to rest their conclusions on the backs of half-remembered interviews on CNN or from rumors they gleamed off the Internets, Hertsgaard interviewed over 175 persons.  Persons from both the press and the Reagan Administration. <br /> <br />It's these interviews that drive the book.  Hertsgaard's technique is to proceed chronologically, letting the quotes build up an individual story, and then inserting his own analysis to show how these specific events fall into an overall pattern.  Hertsgaard spends time analyzing both the construction/distribution of the Reagan \\"message\\" and how that message was parsed by the media.  The pattern seems eerily similar to the post-9/11 coverage of today's government and those parallels will seem obvious and ominous. <br /> <br />I found this to be a very convincing argument.   Hertsgaard obviously has a point of view (negative on both the Reagan policies and on the press coverage they received), but he's very logical and meticulous in laying out his case.  People looking for how the Reagan people played puppet-master with the press may be disappointed, as the overwhelming attention is placed on the self-censorship that took place within the press itself with little need of any influence from the Administration.  However, he does take some time to show how the Reagan Public Relations circle manipulated news and images to place their man in the best light possible. <br /> <br />It's interesting to read about the birth of many awful aspects of the media which were new at the time, but which are now depressingly ever-present.  The author looks at the Presidential Election of 1984 and points out how the media focused more attention on the horse-race, on the latest polls and on the question of who will win at the expense of covering where each candidate actually stood on the issues and whether those positions were wise or foolish.  Hertsgaard correctly points out how such attention on trivia rather than issues does a disservice to the audience and, ultimately, the politicians themselves.   <br /> <br />Many of the book's subjects are still hot topics of political conversation today.  The blurring of news and entertainment.  The fact that more news outlets are owned by fewer and fewer companies and individuals.  The timidity of a press, terrified at the thought of doing anything that might be considered \\"liberal\\".  Still important issues, this is where many of them had their beginnings. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, such reporting is commonplace nowadays.  I'd love to see a follow-up from Hertsgaard written today, analyzing the trends he first noted here.  It would probably be a depressing and predictable read, but it would have to be an important one.  ON BENDED KNEE may be discussing events of twenty years ago, but the points he raises still have resonance today.	2005-08-28
US	50631983	R1061C1U05NOWE	B0006DKROU	207686368	Mr. Citizen	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Mr. President	MR. CITIZEN very much reflects the public persona of its author, President Harry S. Truman.  The essays are written in a straightforward, matter-of-fact style.  There's no flowery language, no colorful turns of phrase.  And he talks about everything from foreign policy and his decision to use the atomic bomb to what his favorite foods are.  It's very direct and to the point.  I quite liked reading it and enjoyed learning his opinions and thoughts on the varied subjects that he covered. <br /> <br />As far as what this book actually contains, I offer a brief summary.  He talks about his life post-White House, his brief, informal meetings with President-elect Eisenhower, his strained relationship with Adlai Stevenson (including his thoughts on why Stevenson would have made a poor President), religion, politics, health, the Constitution, the future of the two US political parties, and many thoughts on the Presidency itself.  In fact, it's this last subject that I found to be of the most interest, and what Truman himself seemed to most enjoy discussing (outside of his childhood in Missouri).  Indeed, the section entitled, \\"What to do with former Presidents\\" made quite a lot of sense to me, and it's a pity that there has not been a major effort to give ex-Presidents debate time in the US Senate.  <br /> <br />Truman's writing style I found to be deceptively simple.  The beginning chapters are full of humorous and slight anecdotes about Truman's life after the White House.  He talks a lot about how ordinary people react to him and how -- despite his best efforts -- it was simply impossible to go back to being a regular citizen after his stint as Mr. President (hence the title).  These stories are told in a light manner, and many of them are quite funny.  I loved the anecdote about the loud guy who stopped outside Truman's house and bellowed, \\"Is this Truman's house?!\\" followed by \\"Are you Truman?!\\" and concluding with a request for a photograph. <br /> <br />These passages ill-prepared me for the more in-depth subjects which were to follow.  He doesn't use a lot of supporting arguments for his conclusions, but I have to admit that he often makes a very good point.  For example, he has a section supporting military conscription for all able-bodied males.  My instinct is to disagree with this thesis, yet he makes a very strong case in saying that an all-volunteer military runs the risk of becoming completely insular and removed from what the civilian population actually wants.  It's not enough to dissuade me from my existing opinions, but I can't say that his argument is without merit.  Indeed, it seems worryingly prescient.  <br /> <br />Some of the very last sections of the book are perhaps just slightly too obscure for the layman like myself and will be of more interest to the hardcore historian.  I simply don't know enough about the Cold War to understand why, say, he wrote entire essays about certain subjects.  His discussion about why the Soviet and US leaders should hold summits inside North America as well as in Moscow makes perfect logical sense, I just don't have enough context to know why its important. <br /> <br />I wish some of these essays had been a little longer so Truman would have been able to spend more time putting forth his arguments and fleshing out his stories.  But that, I imagine, wouldn't have been consistent with the man's style.  In any event, this is a worthy read that offers insights into the thinking behind some of the more important decisions of the twentieth century.  And it's nicely balanced by some personal reflections and good old-fashioned plain speaking.	2005-07-21

I'm one of the people who thinks that Colin Brake's previous Doctor Who book, ESCAPE VELOCITY, got a lot of unfair criticism because of expectations that the book never really was going to match.  Unfortunately, while I thought ESCAPE VELOCITY was a moderately entertaining adventure, I found COLONY to be a couple of notches below that in quality.  I slightly enjoyed it while reading, but on reflection it's not easy to see why.  There isn't much that stands out; the things that do distinguish themselves are missteps.  The book's central premise is absurd and there's really no sense that this adventure is in any way important.  You could probably enjoy this book (and I've certainly read reviews of those who have), but you probably couldn't do so while thinking about it too much. <br /> <br />Colin Brake does a decent job of bringing the regular characters (the second Doctor, Jamie and Zoe) to life.  Unfortunately, he does tend to fall into a common trap for Doctor Who novelists.  The regulars are quite good when interacting with each other: Zoe plays well with Jamie, and the Doctor trying to keep Zoe and Jamie in line is very evocative of their TV personas.  But then Blake splits up his characters for long stretches of the novel, and when he does so they become much more generic and much less like the original characters. <br /> <br />There are also a plethora of silly little oddities that have varying degrees of annoyance.  For example, near the beginning, an important character is hit somewhere on their person by a ricocheting bullet.  But even after long scenes of the character recovering, the audience is never told where on her body this injury occurred.  This makes it quite difficult for the reader to assess how injured the person is.  We must rely on the narrative telling us, \\"No, she isn't recovered yet...  No, still not recovered...  No, maybe next scene, she'll be better...  No, still in bed.\\"  For lack of any evidence at all, my brain automatically made the juvenile assumption that someone had had a butt cheek blown away, possibly making the subsequent recovery scenes less thrilling for me than possibly the author intended.   <br /> <br />But to be serious for a moment, it's this sort of telling-but-not-showing that makes the book somewhat frustrating, because I want to work things out for myself.  This is even more apparent when dealing with the book's central conflict.  Thankfully, this is revealed on the back cover blurb, so I can complain about it without revealing spoilers.  This planet, Axista Four, is home to a single colony (actually one colony and one tiny, breakaway faction, which is only a stone's throw away).  They started with a population of a few thousand but have been slowly decreasing over time due to the unexpected hardships.  The sword that now hangs over their heads is word of 80,000 new colonists who will arrive and disrupt their back-to-basics lifestyle. <br /> <br />These are not huge numbers of people.  Is there really no room on the entire planet for two small towns?  To pick an Earth example, Pennsylvania manages to easily encompass Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and an entire Amish community -- and Pennsylvania is substantially smaller than the size of a planet.  If the back-to-basics people are worried about catching a glimpse of these new people and their technology, couldn't the arrivals simply build their colony -- oh, I don't know -- on the opposite side of the planet?  Nothing is shown to the reader to explain why this is a problem.  The only reason this exists as a story conflict is that the characters and the narrative keep insisting that it is without elaborating as to why.  It wouldn't have taken much to fix this problem (and the others like it), but it simply isn't done.  And it feels more like laziness or rushed work than anything else. <br /> <br />Also, if we're going to criticize stuff from the back cover, I'd like to wager that the aliens are \\"doglike\\" purely to give Jamie the lamest pop culture joke in the history of Doctor Who.  This also manages to date the book far quicker than any hairstyle or costume choice on the TV series.  Oh, and the blurb mentions the appearances of the seventh Doctor and Ace.  The seventh Doctor's involvement really weakens the final conflict, and I'm not convinced that this portion of the story makes any sense at all. <br /> <br />I don't wish to be overly negative, and I'd like to reiterate that I did in fact find much to enjoy while doing the actual page turning.  The pacing is good.  The secondary characters are not thrilling, but nice.  Still, even on that level, I kept bumping into little screw-ups that ripped me out of the story.  Like the energy weapon that fires bullets (okay, I suppose one could technically call a gunpowder explosion a form of \\"energy\\" -- but this is a science fiction novel and the vocabulary of science fiction novels suggests that an energy weapon is a futuristic ray-gun type thing).  Couldn't this sort of thing have been fixed at the editing stage? <br /> <br />The prose is workmanlike.  Extremely workmanlike.  I doubt that there's an original turn of phrase in the entire two hundred, seventy-two pages.  This does make for an exceedingly quick read, but not an especially memorable one.  The characters say exactly what the plot needs them to say.  The words outside the dialog describe the surroundings adequately.  There's little introspection and nothing particularly special.  While the number of existing Doctor Who books seems to grow exponentially, there is not one thing that manages to distinguish this adventure from its peers.	2005-06-27
US	50631983	RNWXIB5FLILBA	0441917062	872368526	World Without Stars	Books	4	17	18	N	N	A Big World	I found a lot to enjoy in Poul Anderson's WORLD WITHOUT STARS.  So much, in fact, that it made me wish I'd explored his books earlier.  This is my first exposure to Anderson and I'm very impressed by his abilities as a storyteller and as a world-builder.<br /><br />At first glance (and looking through the first few chapters), WORLD would appear to be a fairly standard pulp science-fiction novel, with bold humans seeking out new life forms on a strange new world where no human has gone before.  But as you get further along, the story never quite goes where it's expected.  There are a lot of surprises hidden in here.<br /><br />The book contains loads of those neat little science fiction ideas that one expects from this type of book: human immortality, telepathic aliens, future cultural changes, etc.  But what I really enjoyed in addition to the ideas (and the repercussions they have on life in the future) was Anderson's presentation style.  He doesn't simply provide huge information-dumps where every aspect of some space-age development is dryly recited.  Rather the clues are dropped quite subtly. On more than one occasion, I flipped back in the book to reread an earlier passage in the light of a later revelation.  It's a very rewarding read if you like that sort of thing (as I do).<br /><br />The plot is relatively straightforward; a group of humans is marooned on a seemingly primitive planet and must contend with strange cultures of aliens who regard these invaders with suspicion (and not for the usual reasons).  However, the plot is secondary to the tour-de-force of the character of Hugh Valland who provides the book with its emotional core.  He's a fascinating character, and, while bordering on clich&eacute; at times, he's entirely memorable and single-handedly brings the book to life.  His back-story, slowly revealed through the novel, is what gives the novel its weight.<br /><br />The back cover blurb of the Ace edition I own gives away far too much of the plot, and I recommend not reading it if you can possibly resist the temptation.  This is a short book (the paperback ends at exactly the 150 page mark), but it packs quite a punch.  The Valland character and the neat ideas running throughout give this book a depth that belies its size.  I'll be looking out for more Poul Anderson books in the future.t, and I recommend not reading it if you can possibly resist the temptation.

As advertised, U2 AT THE END OF THE WORLD begins with the recording of U2's Achtung Baby album in 1991 and covers every major event up until the preliminary recording for what would become The Passengers project in late 1994 (it's never actually named in the text, but there are descriptions of U2 collaborating with Brian Eno to produce soundtracks to movies that don't exist).  However, given the author's long association with the band, stories pop up randomly of events dating back to the band's first tour of America through to the then-present day and includes some thoughts of the future.  All in all, it's a very engrossing read. <br /> <br />The story is told by Bill Flanagan, a music journalist who has been friends with the band since the early 1980s.  U2 are famously protective of their image, and one gets the impression that the band was open to Flanagan's questions precisely because they hoped their friendship would put events in the best possible light.  Indeed, Flanagan's relationship with the individual band members shines through.  And while these gives the book a very intimate feeling, it doesn't prevent the journalist from looking askance as some of the more colorful activities of those years (Adam Clayton's brushes with the law and his problems with alcohol being the most obvious examples).  The friendly feeling also allows the band to \\"answer the critics\\" in a way by addressing some of the more controversial/criticized of their activities (their support of Greenpeace and human rights groups, the overt Christianity present in the early albums, their position or lack thereof concerning the Northern Ireland situation, to name a few). <br /> <br />The book also gets us inside some of the most ambitions projects that U2 engaged in.  Namely, the ACHTUNG BABY and ZOOROPA albums and the massive spectacle that was the Zoo TV world tour.  Bono was quite glib in television interviews at the time (\\"I don't know what Zoo TV is about, so it must be art.\\"), but to Flanagan the band members open up, explaining the influences and the philosophies behind the multimedia circus.  Yes, some of it does indeed come off as pretentious, but I found it fascinating to see what was going on behind the scenes.  The passages recounting the transmission of live images from war-torn Sarajevo to an audience expecting to see a rock'n'roll show are excellent at conveying what must have been a shocking and emotional event. <br /> <br />And in addition to all that, U2 AT THE END OF THE WORLD is an excellent tour diary, recounting random anecdotes about life on the road and the various band members, roadies, management types and other characters.  Given the band's high profile, it's not surprising that there are a lot of celebrity cameos.  Frank Sinatra shows up (he and Bono recorded a duet of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" during this time), as do Naomi Campbell, Lou Reed, Bill Clinton (both as Arkansas Governor and then again after his successful Presidential campaign), and, of course, long time pal of the band (and former Virgin Prune) Gavin Friday.  Some of the stories are really really funny. <br /> <br />This is a fun, yet insightful read.  The fun anecdotes prevent the book from getting too heavy, and the deeper portions prevent the book from being too fluffy.  It's a great combination of philosophical ruminations and pure entertainment (perhaps an inadvertent metaphor for the Zoo TV tour itself).  It's written in an easy, conversational style which makes it easy to pick up and put down.  In fact, I must have read a good quarter of the book just through random skimming before I settled in and started back at the beginning.  Much recommended for the U2 fan, and I imagine even non-fans would get something out of it.	2005-06-08
US	50631983	R7CO73PWI6OQQ	190388912X	669889605	Doctor Who: Rip Tide (Doctor Who Novellas)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	"Here comes the ocean and the waves down by the sea"	I'd never heard of Louise Cooper before, but according to Stephen Gallagher's introduction, she's a writer of Young Adult stories.  And indeed RIP TIDE feels very much like something aimed at that market.  The main character is a good-hearted teenage girl, Nina.  She has problems relating to her family.  Most of the scenes are not told from any one character's point of view.  Jokes are explained to the reader.  An omnipotent third person narrator tells us when people are lying.  Characters are described using a small, static set of words (before the Doctor is explicated named, he is almost always revealed by the author's reuse of the same words and phrases). <br /> <br />These are not criticisms.  I thoroughly enjoyed the style.  In fact, it kept the pace of the book moving very quickly.  I can easily imagine this book written in a more adult, more subversive and less obvious manner, and that version would easily be twice as long.  There isn't all that much plot to the story -- just about enough for a book this length.  So the style in which it is told is very important to the overall effect. <br /> <br />One of the more unusual aspects of this story was how much real time it takes up.  Days and weeks pass between scenes.  The pace is very slow and deliberate.  This is certainly a huge difference from many other Doctor Who stories, where the Doctor and his companions arrive during daylight hours, get involved in a massive, universe-changing adventure, and leave before sunset on the same day. <br /> <br />In addition to the leisurely pace and the small scale of the adventure, one realizes that there really isn't much plot in this.  It's very much a find-the-problem-and-fix-it story with only a handful of obstacles put in the way of the protagonists.  But it's the way that everything unfolds that appealed to me.  There aren't very many big surprises, yet it's still very absorbing.  I can only echo Stephen Gallagher's introduction and state that the \\"what-happens-nextsense of story\\" works very well. <br /> <br />I had two songs stuck in my head while reading -- The Velvet Underground's \\"The Ocean\\" and Bruce Lash's \\"High Water\\".  This wasn't a coincidence.  This is a story set in an English village by the sea, and the ocean plays a big part.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it's almost a secondary character in its own right, but it certain adds heavily to the book's atmosphere.  The village and its inhabitants are also fleshed out extremely well.  I don't know if they were based on reality at all, but they certainly felt like real people.  There were loads of little details that went a long way towards painting a satisfying picture. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed seeing Cooper's take on the Eighth Doctor, the text of the story never unambiguously names him, but the characterization and the publicity material can't lie.  He definitely possesses the more fluffy aspects of his personality as seen in the TV movie, but there's a sterner core, a heart of stone at the center of his absent-minded professor persona.  It's a great balance, and one not always seen in the print adventures of the Eighth Doctor. <br /> <br />RIP TIDE is, as I said before, very much in the Young Adult style.  There is a clear moral at the end.  There is a definite and obvious connection between the life of Nina, and the lives of the book's central aliens.  Doctor Who, of course, began as a family show and so, even after all the changes the series has gone through since, this style still suits it.  And it's not written in a way that annoyed this adult, so I can certainly report that I enjoyed it.	2005-05-18

It seemed just another science fiction novel, albeit one that was a little difficult for me to read at that tender age.  Revisiting this as an adult is an eye-opening experience.  Not only did I find more to enjoy in the story and the prose, but I caught a lot more of the metaphors and real-life parallels that H. G. Wells invoked.<br /><br />One of the really noticeable aspects of the novel (especially when compared to more modern science fiction writings) is how human it seems.  Wells was apparently fascinated by the thought of how people and societies would react to an alien invasion.  He shows us both the micro- and the macro-level.  We see the panic on the collective mind of the general populous.  We're shown the unreasoning hysteria present in a frightened mob.  But Wells also makes the fear individual.  Not only are we viewing the situation from the eyes of the narrator, but we're encountering particular people each reacting to the situation in different (yet entirely reasonable) ways.  The false bravado, the total inability of the human mind of cope -- they're all presented here.<br /><br />Another thing that immediately struck me was the rich use of language.  I've read so many books written in an overly simplistic \\"he said, she said\\" fashion that I really appreciated this.  Some readers may find it tedious, but I found it very absorbing.<br /><br />In short, I really enjoyed reading this.  It's not a particularly long novel, and I managed to put it to bed in a single afternoon sitting.  THE WAR OF THE WORLDS had a profound message at its core, one that would be diminished through the following years by the many science fiction movies that ripped out the events without fully understanding the meaning.  H. G. Wells was showing his 19th Century audience the dangers of British Imperialism.  He wanted to show the effect that so-called liberations and enlightenments had on the indigenous populations.  The lessons for the 21st Century are obvious.  And for this reason, WAR is so much more than just the first sci-fi alien invasion story.  While we still inhabit a world of war and conquerors, the message of WAR OF THE WORLDS will, unfortunately, be necessary.and enlightenments had on the indigenous populations.

Everything I knew about William Randolph Hearst I learned from the movie CITIZEN KANE.  So when I found a cheap, second-hand copy of CITIZEN HEARST, I decided to pick it up and educate myself.  Not only was this informative, but highly entertaining.  A man capable of rousing such fiercely diametric emotions from people reading his biography decades after his death must surely have raised the ire of his contemporaries something fierce.  It is with very mixed emotions that the modern reader comes to understand the events of Heart's life, but those feelings probably aren't a million miles away from what was felt at the time.  While reading this biography I kept leaping between admiration and loathing for the subject -- an experience I've never quite had before. <br /> <br />My copy of CITIZEN HEARST is over six hundred pages and written in a smaller than average font size.  Yet, as the biographer points out, with the sheer amount of stuff that Hearst accomplished (or at least attempted) in his life, it would be easy to dedicate an entire volume just to single individual activities.  But, W. A. Swanberg does a great job of summarizing the main details of Hearst's life without being overly superficial.  I even enjoyed the opening sections, dealing with William Randolph Heart's childhood.  Many times in biographies, this ends up being a list of dates, schools and relatives; yet Swanberg defies the norm and gives the child Hearst an interesting story. <br /> <br />Of course, the main account is everything that Hearst did after his early-twenties, when he took a fancy towards the journalistic world and obtained a newspaper from his wealthy father.  Hearst's subsequent ideas of journalism, his later political ambitions (he fixed his sights on the White House, but never did get higher than the United States House of Representatives), and his obsessive collection of art and property are all laid out meticulously and clearly. <br /> <br />And the information imparted is absolutely unbelievably fascinating.  We think the media is pretty bad today, but after reading this I realize that the today's Ted Turners and Rupert Murdochs have absolutely nothing on the yellow journalism of that era.  Organizing divisions of reporters to arrive at the scene of a crime before the police do or staging an elaborate midnight rescue of a Cuban \\"princess\\" from the Spanish army -- can we really imagine Bill O'Reilly or Aaron Brown attempting those ratings stunts? <br /> <br />In addition to detailing Heart's business and political aspirations, Swanberg also delves into an aspect of Heart's life that was brilliantly captured in Orson Welles' portrayal of Charles Foster Kane (the thinly veiled fictionalized version of Heart himself).  Just as Welles' character was a ruthless and ambition man, who is also shown happily spending hours using silly shadow puppets to entertain a sad, lonely girl, Swanberg introduces us to a serious, focused, cutthroat and dangerous man who was exceedingly soft-spoken, kind on a personal level and who would easily break into goofy vaudeville-style dances to amuse his friends. <br /> <br />This biography not only informed me, but also got me curious on a variety of related subjects that I intend to study further.  I knew almost nothing, for example, about Hearst's intervention in the lead up to the Spanish-American War (Swanberg practically gives him sole credit for the entire enterprise).  Now, I'm dying to read more about it. <br /> <br />This is definitely one of the best biographies I've read, though certainly not about one of the best people.  Based on the information provided, Hearst was an impossible man to pin down and understand.  Swanberg posits a metaphor of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Hearst could be one man around some people, the other in different circumstances.  In any case, this biography would appear to be an almost impossible task, and yet Swanberg has done a yeoman's service.  I'd recommend this even to someone withno interest in the area because the writing and the subject are just too compelling.	2005-04-13

I liked VENUSIAN LULLABY for the same reasons frequently stated elsewhere.  That it depicted a uniquely alien culture and did so in a logical, believable manner.  And, yet, I can't quite place it up there with the classics of the Doctor Who range, because other portions of it were rather pedestrian.  It's good, it's a bold experiment (for Doctor Who), but it's not quite perfect. <br /> <br />Before I move into more whining passages, I need to give credit where it's due.  Paul Leonard did a superb job of creating a valid, alien-seeming society.  Given the ludicrous illustration on the cover, the average person could be forgiven for assuming this to be a one-dimensional story where the aliens do nothing but make beeping noises and shout, \\"Resistance is stupid!\\" <br /> <br />But that isn't at all what the aliens in this book are like.  They look strange, they act different (though the Venusian children behave a little too much like human children for my liking) and their thinking does not closely resemble human thought.  I loved every bit of the Venusian customs.  I can only wonder if it was as much fun for Leonard to write this stuff as it was to read. <br /> <br />And I loved the decision to make this a First Doctor/Ian/Barbara story.  The slower pace of this book really made it feel of that era.  (The Doctor even goes missing for a sizable chuck of the middle, either an accidental or tongue-in-cheek reenactment of William Hartnell going on vacation during the season.)  In fact, I always thought that period of the show was much more interested than later years in giving the alien or human cultures more interesting and detailed backgrounds.  The show was still exploring and establishing its own boundaries in those days, and it seems appropriate that it would allow time to explore the environment of the current story. <br /> <br />The invocation of the regular characters is outstanding.  Without rehashing dialog or situations verbatim from the second season, Leonard utterly captures what this reader imagined as their mindset during that time.  Ian and Barbara's opinion of the Doctor, their desire to return home, their common-sense attitude to the strange wonders they encounter -- all perfectly accurate.  I was especially impressed by how Leonard manages to express the Venusian culture through Barbara's \\"remembering\\" ritual at the funeral while still managing to be completely true to her character.  The subtle trick of introducing the utterly unfamiliar through the eyes of one of the most familiar characters in Doctor Who history is nothing short of a triumph. <br /> <br />Where the book begins to falter is when it moves away from character moments and Venusian culture and instead becomes involved in the rather humdrum plot.  I would much preferred the book padding its length with more of the Venusian world-building.  I could happily spend all day reading more about the Venusian funeral customs.  More scenes involving the Venusians' goofy plans to escape their dying planet?  I'm there.  But the unfortunate sequences of companions endlessly hiking all the way across the planet trying to find their lost friends just didn't do anything for me.  The book clocks in at 316 pages, making it slightly longer than the average for a Doctor Who novel, and the storyline just isn't quite involved enough to justify that length. <br /> <br />In fact, I found the last hundred or so pages rather tedious.  It's almost as if Leonard, figuring he had done enough with the background, could simply place his plot into that setting and run with it.  Judging by other, extremely positive reviews, this method worked out all right for him, but it left me a little cold.  If I reread this book, I'll have to manage my time better so that I'm not breaking it into little chunks.  Given enough momentum from the excellent beginning and middle sections, it might have made the plot-oriented ending easier to digest.	2005-02-24

But THE STARS LIKE DUST reminded me of a genre that I had not yet come across in his fiction: the thriller.  The influences aren't enormous, but they're present.  There's a hunt for a secret document, a political power struggle, and a puppet master directing the action from behind the scenes.  And as successful as Asimov had been at incorporating the fundamentals of the detective novel into his own, he is similarly triumphant here.  While there are definitely some rough spots, they come more from the pulp origins of this kind of story than from any other genre it incorporated. <br /> <br />First of all, this is a typically engaging and engrossing story.  It's not Asimov at the absolute top of his game, but it's easy enough for the reader to keep turning these pages.  Even when he's running on autopilot (as one suspects during part of the plot's introduction and some of the later, quieter moments), it's nothing short of fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br />Asimov's plotting is again quite good.  Indeed, there are some elements of it that reminded me of portions of his other books (for example, there's a character who makes bold and logical predictions about the movement of individual important people -- a very small scale version of the psychohistory that would appear later in his FOUNDATION series).  But as with most of Asimov's work, while I did find it to contain a lot of familiar touchstones, it still felt very fresh. <br /> <br />There were a few points that prevented me from placing this among the very top of Asimov's novels.  Characterization is something that Asimov himself said he didn't always get right (though I will sometimes give him more credit than he gave himself) and, unfortunately, it's difficult to believe in the romance between the male and female leads.  He usually stayed away from this kind of coupling, and it seemed clear that heseemed a lot less confident writing about male/female relationships than he did about molecules, planetary movements and other science facts. <br /> <br />Speaking of science, it's also easy to see why Asimov's non-fiction writing was so effortless to read.  He's quite good at making potentially intimidating science speeches seem clear and simple.  Of course, what he isn't always quite so good at is incorporating them seamlessly into his plots.  This book more so than most of his that I've read seemed to have a bit too many places where the characters suddenly deliver science lectures to other characters for no real overriding reason (yes, they related to the plot, but could easily have been removed with no loss of reader understand occurring).  It's not that they're confusing -- far from it.  It just made me think that they were included mostly because Asimov liked talking about science more than for any other reason. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I did like the fact that the science was important to the story.  Oftentimes in science fiction novels, the actual mechanics of life in the future is hand-waved away.  While that is sometimes desirable (if the author is more interested in plot and character than scientific speculation), I do occasionally enjoy the type of conjectures on display here.  During the story's chase/traveling sequences we get some fun thinking from Asimov about how future space travel will work.  It's fascinating, if only to see what the cutting edge of thought was in the early 1950s.  Asimov puts a lot of thought into how faster-than-light travel will take place.  But, amusingly from a modern standpoint, he missed out on computers completely, having the mathematical calculations of interstellar travel taking place by hand using libraries of reference books! <br /> <br />At the time of writing this review, THE STARS LIKE DUST would appear to be out-of-print.  Which is a shame because it's a nice, enjoyable story that doesn't deserve relegation to hard-to-find status.  This isn't top-tier Asimov, so I can't truthfully recommend spending a lot of money.  But if you find a good, cheap, used copy, it's well worth purchasing.  I read the bulk of it while airplane traveling and it made for a very happy, undemanding companion.	2005-02-02
US	50631983	R1LKSQZ3OK17AI	0670033561	359169189	Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Rumpole, alone and without an equal	\\"Do you not recall,\\" Leo McKern would state while tilting his head back and gazing into the studio lights, \\"the Penge Bungalow case...  which I won, alone and without a leader?\\"  The Penge Bungalow murder case was to the Rumpole television/book series what the Giant Rat of Sumatra was to Sherlock Holmes -- an investigation referred to but never documented... until now.  And not only that, but RUMPOLE AND THE PENGE BUNGALOW MURDERS also fills into a lot of the other unknowns of the Rumpole universe: how he first met the Timsons and the Molloys, how he joined Chambers, how he became an expert in the science of bloodstains, and, most unimaginably of all, how he met and became wed to the fearsome She Who Must Be Obeyed. <br /> <br />This was undeniably a huge risk for author John Mortimer.  Revealing hitherto unknown background details often leads to disappointment, with the audience preferring the answers their imagination had provided.  (Remember how disappointing it was when we finally learned Kramer's first name on Seinfeld?)  Yet, Mortimer seems to have done just fine with this grand unveiling.  History will decide whether the Penge Bungalow murders depicted here are worthy of the reverence bestowed upon them when they were simply vague references, but this reader was not disappointed.   <br /> <br />The story is told as a series of flashbacks, with the great lawyer himself finally deciding to tell the tale, lest it be lost to and forgotten by the next generation.  This is actually a nice compromise.  The younger Rumpole is less confident in interacting with his peers, but he is presented by the voice of the older Rumpole.  Therefore, the familiar grumpy, witty narrator known well from previous books is maintained.  (The existence of the Rumpole television series  -- and especially Leo McKern's unmatchable performance as Rumpole -- made it very difficult for me to visualize this one.  It's hard to imagine a younger, slimmer Rumpole when the image of the older, plumper McKern is so unshakably fixed inside my head as the definitive Rumpole.) <br /> <br />The mystery itself is pure and classic Rumpole.  One part deduction, one part wine-induced inspiration, and one part sheer luck (Rumpole even comments on the certainly of chance), the formula will be familiar to any previous fan of the series.  But, the advantage is that it feels fresh enough that if you liked the style before, you'll like it again, but probably not be tired of it.  The social commentary (a usual feature of these stories) is present again and works well at grounding the story, preventing it from being too fluffy. <br /> <br />Mortimer's gift of characterization is back too.  Apart from the title character's appeal, he fills in a lot of the details of characters known of old: C. H. Wystan (She Who Must's father and Rumpole's Head of Chambers), Uncle Tom, Bernard the solicitor, etc.  It's partly Mortimer's characters that make this such a wonderful series.  Even Erskin-Brown and \\"Soapy\\" Sam Ballard, who have only extended cameos, are utterly believable -- even given that they are painted with pretty broad strokes.   <br /> <br />This is not the book to begin exploring Rumpole if you are new to the series.  You'll be wondering why some trivial-seeming elements are treated with grand importance.  But if you're already fairly knowledgeable of Rumpole, then you simply cannot miss this -- a classic story and a lot of questions finally answered.  I really enjoyed reading this, and I hope that the revelations are not a sign that Mortimer feels ready to leave the series.	2005-01-12
US	50631983	R9FSSS0B9LXVR	0563486163	252786801	Doctor Who: The Tomorrow Windows (Doctor Who (BBC))	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Don't Panic...	While the book's closing acknowledgements proclaim a dedication to the late Douglas Adams, it also mentions that this is not meant to be a pastiche of his work.  Indeed THE TOMORROW WINDOWS does not feel like a rehash or a rip-off of Adams, but it certainly feels informed (or at least influenced) by his fiction.  There's a worldview present in Adams' writings that Jonathan Morris captures quite well.  I wasn't sure I was going to like the book, but somewhere near the middle it won me over. <br /> <br />It actually took me a while to get a handle on this book, because it kept confounding my expectations.  There are a lot of different locations/settings that focus is placed upon and then quickly removed.  So I initially didn't pay much attention to the introduction of the main group of secondary characters because at the relatively late stage in which they appeared, I was expecting them to be introduced and then leave within twenty pages.  I'm not mentioning this as a criticism, I merely wish to describe how loose and fast the book plays with its locations and casts of characters.  It's actually a nice effect.  It gives the book a quick pace and makes it feel very different from the EDAs that came before it. <br /> <br />As for the jokes, well, humor is very hard to do and extremely difficult to maintain over the course of nearly three hundred pages.  I thought a lot of the witticisms near the beginning didn't quite hit their mark (although the stuff with \\"God\\" addressing various cultures was hilarious).  Yet somewhere near the middle, the book had finally made enough of an impression into my slow brain that I was able to appreciate the jokes.  Maybe it just takes a little while to get into this book's style.  I suspect that if I read it a second time, my appreciation would begin earlier in the page count. <br /> <br />Like the Douglas Adams books that, perhaps, inspired parts of this story, one gets the impression that there's actually more here than meets the eye.Take the whole \\"there's someone else inside my mind!\\" subplot.  This has been told a million billion times before, but Morris manages to tell it in a slightly new way, giving it exactly the sort of creepy, unsettling feeling that sort of story element should invoke.  The political satires are done well do.  They're certainly broad and obvious (not necessarily a bad thing), but work because they're so blasted funny. <br /> <br />What I really ended up liking about the book was how rich it was.  There are lots of mad ideas all over the place that you can't quite imagine the author getting away with in an overly serious tome.  But they're very welcome here.   <br /> <br />I initially thought through the opening passages that I'd be coming down hard on this one.  I figured I'd be slamming it as an unfunny mess, relying on in-jokes to other series for its attempts at humor.  But it kept working and working until it finally wore me down and won me over.  I'm glad it did and I think I'll be revisiting it at some point.	2005-01-11
US	50631983	R1U4JJQJWNGLN7	0426204697	505328735	The Eye of the Giant (Doctor Who - The Missing Adventures Series)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The Thrill of the Fight	The reason I enjoyed THE EYE OF THE GIANT is almost certainly because I saw the name on the cover and adjusted my expectations accordingly.  I knew to expect readable prose, shallow-to-middling characterizations, a straightforward plot and not much in the way of surprises.  That's what I expected, and that's what I got.  And I liked it.  It won't win any awards, but if you're looking for something that just entertains, you could do a lot worse. <br /> <br />\\"I could imagine this one actually being filmed in the 1970s\\" is often used as a complaint about a book that hasn't reached the full potential that the written word offers.  Yet while that statement is applicable here, I don't see it as a disadvantage on this occasion.  THE EYE OF THE GIANT invokes the spirit of the era without rehashing the same material. <br /> <br />There's not really much to talk about here.  The plot is adequate, not being overly flashy, fancy, complicated or deep.  However, I'll give it a lot of credit for being entertaining, which I expect is all the author was attempting.  Of course, on the downside, there's a couple of really odd false endings, where it seems that the story has ended and then it jerks to life unconvincingly like a dead celebrity reanimated for a beer commercial.  The book would have been a lot stronger had these additions to the end been removed. <br /> <br />On the subject of the book's cast, well, let me say that I doubt whether Bulis has ever written an entirely three-dimensional character in his life.  But he's written much worse caricatures before, and his original characters here perform their functions adequately.  His depiction of the UNIT cast as it existed in the show's seventh season I found surprisingly effective.  He doesn't provide any superior insights into the era, but he does invoke it well with very few paint-strokes.   <br /> <br />It gets a little fanwanky at times (Captain Yates first meets the Doctor), but overall I enjoyed this one.  I may not remember many details about it a year from now, yet for the few days it took me to plow through it, I cannot deny that I was having a good time.	2005-01-05
US	50631983	R2O5U76JGVMF3Y	0671021311	397995807	Get a Life!	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	"This really is William Shatner, and I stink!"	The man who popularized the phrase, \\"Get a life!\\" writes a book to deal the dirt on those people for whom the expression most applies.  It sounds like a wacky idea, but it actually turned out quite well.  William Shatner and his co-author Chris Kreski have a pleasant, enjoyable, breezy prose style and what they're talking about it actually interesting.  There's an entire strange sub-culture that goes on in science fiction fandom and it's fascinating to get a peek at it.  Unfortunately, since this comes from William Shatner, it's not going to get at the darker side (through no fault of the author), but for what it is, it succeeds.    First of all, I should state that while I'm a fan of (a few of) the Star Trek series, I'm not terribly big into fandom.  So while I'm certainly not ignorant of the vocabulary, I was a bit fuzzy on the details.  But once the stories and the backstage secrets are revealed, well, it turns out there aren't that many big surprises.  Shatner may have been astonished to learn that fans were as interested in hanging out with each as with the \\"stars\\", but it shouldn't come as a shock to most other people.    The book is more a journey of exploration than a straightforward journalistic look at fandom.  The journey belongs to William Shatner.  Apparently at one time he was famous among fan-circles for arriving shortly before his appearances, saying a few quick words and then counting his money on the next flight out of town.  But after his character was killed off in one of the Star Trek movies, he decided to take a closer look at what went on at the convention scene.    GET A LIFE! begins with a potted history of organized Star Trek fandom.  Given that Shatner freely admits to have had nothing at all to do with that, I can only assume that this portion of the book was researched by either Shatner or Kreski.  Although the progression isn't exactly unexpected, I enjoyed reading about how it came about.    The book then moves into Shatner's relationship with fandom.  Moving from his aforementioned \\"take the money and run\\" approach to gradual curiosity to understanding, reading his journey is quite interesting to see how someone from outside looks in.      Now, human nature being what it is, we can gather that not everything is warm hugs and embraces within fandom.  I'm no fool; a quick look around the Internet can bring up thousands of flame-wars, feuds, angry grudges, various \\"he said / she said\\" battles and, in some extreme cases, lawsuits and restraining orders between various members of fandom.  The book never gets into this topic, which I found a bit of a disappointment.      The portrayal of fandom is almost overwhelmingly positive.  Lip service is paid to the looniest aspects - the folks who dress in Star Trek uniforms to inappropriate venues - but for the most part, anything negative is glossed over.  The reasons for this rest on the author.  I imagine it must be virtually impossible for William Shatner to go to a convention and not be greeted by a venerable wall of yes-men who happily tell him that everything is running fine, everyone connected with the organization is well liked and that there's nothing bad going on at all.      Still, despite possible inaccuracies and/or omissions, I did enjoy reading this one.  It's funny, amusing and quick to read.  There are numerous unrelated anecdotes, but I didn't find them at all distracting.  Overall, I liked reading this.  It's not the deepest sociological study you'll ever read, but the look it takes at certain individual fans is especially interesting.  The thought of William Shatner donning a latex match and wandering through the dealers room to do research is certainly an amusing idea.	2005-01-03

Coming after the \\"Alternative Universe / Causality Is Falling Apart / Sabbath's Employers Are Really Dull\\" arc, all HALFLIFE had to do was show up, being vaguely enjoyable, and it would automatically rise above the average and set itself up as the bold look forward. <br /> <br />I did, in fact, find HALFLIFE enjoyable, although I couldn't describe it as much more than mediocre.  It does a lot of nice things, but it doesn't have enough of a wallop for them to be really effective.  The book is successful when concentrating on the characters (I particularly enjoyed following Trix's story), but less so when forced along by its (merely adequate) plot. <br /> <br />For example, take the setting that we have.  It's actually quite good and an effective use of world-building.  I was really interested in this planet and enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second because that was the portion where much of the exploration and explanation took place.  Yet, it doesn't quite ring totally true.  In a nice touch, the population is made up entirely of non-white human colonists (despite the freedom that the novels allow, we still usually end up with planets populated by four to six British character actors).  But somehow their society's ruling structure is based on Northern European fairy-tales (we have the evil, scheming Queen; the old, sick, kindly King; the dopey, \\"bad\\" Prince; etc).   <br /> <br />There's a lot of other stuff that almost works, but just stops short of being really effective.  Take the book's characters.  When they're introduced, they're thinking, living creatures who you could imagine having lives of their own.  Yet once the story gets going, they become more generic.  In fact, in the later stages, I was having trouble keeping two characters separated in my mind despite the fact that in the beginning they had vastly different characteristics. <br /> <br />And as for the amnesia stuff that appears here again...  Why is it I feel that I have more confidence in the amnesia idea than the editorial staff does?  I mean, honestly, it's not that big of a deal.  The Doctor's lost some -- but not all -- of his memory.  This prevents him from spouting random continuity references every few paragraphs.  Fine.  Great.  Must we keep going on defending it?  If it's going to be resolved, can we get on with resolving it?  If it's going to be the current state of affairs, can we not just treat it as the current state of affairs and continue forward?  We aren't exploring this situation or learning more about it or doing new fascinating things with it, we're just rehashing it over and over again.  Granted, Michalowski tries to make something interesting out of it, but it's an uphill fight.  Moving into what seems like Year Twenty-Seven of this story element, I just can't imagine there are too many people left in the readership who even care at this point.  I know I don't. <br /> <br />Despite my whines, this is still a decent story told simply and well.  It's not the greatest book we've seen in this line, but it's head and shoulders above most of the previous story-arc.  Its characters at least start off competently, and while the story may seem predictable at times, I found it absorbing the whole way through.  If this is the Grand Future (at least until that Grand Future is bulldozed by the Second Rising of the New Series), then I'm warming to it.  But, guys, no more amnesia waffling, okay?	2004-12-29
US	50631983	R3R8T6232GDYPE	0451160444	467915322	Christine (Signet)	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Baby, you can drive my car	I was looking for a good scary book to read in the fall (this time of year, when it's getting dark out early, seems to be the best time to get into a good horror novel) so I went with the most famous horror novelist today, Stephen King.  CHRISTINE is one of his more famous novels (there's a movie version as well) and since I hadn't read that one yet, I decided to give it a try.  Turns out that while I did get a decent read, I didn't get one that really scared me.  It's an engrossing and enjoyable story, but it didn't really scare me the way I hoped it would. <br /> <br />Here's the problem: the book is about a haunted, psychotic car, and cars aren't inherently frightening things.  Oh sure, if you're flying down the highway in heavy traffic and your brakes fail, or your accelerator cuts out, then, yeah, that's terrifying.  But lying awake at night and imagining that the strange noises that you can barely hear are really the sounds of an unruly automobile?  No, not scary.  The book, therefore, goes more for gross-out horror than psychological fear, which is fine if that's what you're looking for.  I was disappointed in that I was hoping for something with more of a creepy atmosphere. <br /> <br />So, considering that cars are scarier in actuality than they are in the abstract, where does this book succeed?  Well, it does very well when it sticks to its characters.  King's characters aren't particularly deep, but with five hundred pages to work with, he certainly puts a lot into them.  This is where the book works, when it's dealing with the problems and relationships of its characters.  I had not been overly impressed by the characters at the beginning, but towards the end I had genuinely begun to care about them and their fates.  And the book is more horrific when presenting us with a good old-fashioned ghost tale instead of a less than thrilling possession-of-an-inanimate-object story. <br /> <br />CHRISTINE is a five hundred page novel that never bored me, so I shouldn't dwell on the negatives too much.  While King's prose style here wouldn't be described as sophisticated, it is strikingly readable.  It's an undemanding read and certainly enjoyable and even fun in a way.  I just wish it had been a little scarier.	2004-11-22
US	50631983	R1XPHAK93GWNAZ	0563486112	982011138	Sometime Never... (Doctor Who)	Books	1	6	8	N	N	Just stop	I'm actually shocked by how much I disliked SOMETIME NEVER...  There are some decent set pieces.  Some boring set pieces.  Things unfold because the author decides that what needs to happen.  There's some corridor-running.  Worse, there's some technobabble-laden corridor-running.  But overall, the whole exercise just lacks oomph.  Not only is it a poor resolution to a, frankly, terrible story-arc, it's not even a decent book in its own right. <br /> <br />First of all, can I state how tired I am of the whole \\"a butterfly's flight changing the course of a hurricane\\" thing?  Yes, I liked Ray Bradbury's \\"A Sound Of Thunder\\", but I am absolutely sick to death of encountering and revisiting these references in time travel fiction over and over again.  Maybe this is a sign that I need to vary the fiction I read.  But, look, this sort of stuff was clever the first million times I saw it; can't we just grab hold of some other idea to beat to death? <br /> <br />Getting to the book's specifics, this is a story where The Universe and/or History Itself is threatened.  Again.  Yes, in resolving a story-arc in which each uninteresting story concerned threats to Everything, we are presented with a story in which there is an enormous threat.  To Everything.  You can only go to that well so many times, and I think this aspect of the story-arc overstayed its welcome at about, oh, the third or fourth time out.  Yet there we go again.  A universe populated by utterly uninteresting characters is again faced with absolute, total, and certain destruction.  There's something wrong in a book where I, the reader, find myself cheering on the collapse of everything only because I wanted to see something (anything!) interesting happen. <br /> <br />The resolution to the story-arc is vaguely logical, but totally uninteresting.  The back of the book tells us of the Council of Eight.  And now that I've read about them, I'm disheartened to report that they are exactly as boring and stereotypical as their initial description would suggest.  They're mysterious.  They have a mysterious plan.  They live in a mysterious fortress which is mysteriously cut off from the rest of the universe.  There's very little that's original here and, thus, all attempts at forging a creepy or fearful atmosphere fail.  And what original material exists is utterly lacking in soul.  The plot unfolds dryly, with no passion or imagination. <br /> <br />For a book about predictability, predetermination and events unfolding logically, SOMETIME NEVER... strangely feels random as hell.  And worse than that, it feels awfully contrived.  Villains delay attacks long enough for the Doctor to explain the plot to the dumb humans.  Exposition is given by having two characters explain things to each other that each is already aware of.  This is not what you expect from an author whose rsum is as long as Justin Richards' is.  Richards has written much better than this before.  Richards has written much better than this in situations where he's slapping something together at the last minute to fill the book schedule.  What's the excuse here when the book was presumably planned out literally years ago? <br /> <br />Oh, and that weird reference at the end utterly baffled me.  It wasn't until I started wandering around the Internet that I found out it was a tie-in to SCREAM OF THE SHALKA.  Um, couldn't we have had a reference to something that was actually good?  What is the bloody point referencing a dull story in the middle of another dull story?  Boredom raised to the power of banal.  Oh, and what was up with that bizarre AN UNEARTHLY CHILD thing?  I mean...  What?!  Why?! <br /> <br />If not for the fact that the Internet has informed me that future stories in this book series are more standalone (and indeed will eventually be replaced by Ninth Doctor Adventures), I think I would be giving up now.  It's depressing to think that this is the book that the series had been leading up to.  This wholearc has been a series of failures at both the individual book level (save for some worthy exceptions such as the brilliant EMOTIONAL CHEMISTRY) and of the overall meta-story.  Thank God it's over.  And let's hope that the powers that be have learned from their mistakes.  Here's to the future.	2004-11-13
US	50631983	R1BPSWJSBFJF7	0345389662	942915084	Nightmare, with Angel	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Plot, with character	In the hands of most authors, NIGHTMARE, WITH ANGEL would be an amusing distraction.  But given that it comes from the pen (or keyboard, one assumes) of Stephen Gallagher, we must expect something a little bit better than that.  And he certainly delivers on those expectations.  NIGHTMARE is not just a tightly paced, exciting psychological thriller; it's also a fascinating character study.   <br /> <br />Gallagher places as much importance on character and theme as he does upon plot and story.  To be honest, I'm not sure which he did the best, because all of those aspects were well done.  He creates a small number of extremely realistic characters and slowly reveals them to the reader at a thoughtful pace.  The fact that he does this for characters of both genders, a child, and someone of questionable mental facilities is commendable.  He manages to make all of these people seem real.  And even though they are strongly defined, he can still have them perform surprises. <br /> <br />The plot is actually quite simple when you boil it down to a sentence: a young girl and a man run away from the child's father in an attempt to discover what happened to her mother.  But Gallagher packs a lot of shocks along the way.  It's straightforward but it isn't at all predictable. <br /> <br />I mentioned earlier being impressed by Gallagher's themes.  This was the part of the story that will stick with me.  He throws thoughts of redemption and forgiveness into his twist on good vs. evil.  It's this sort of thoughtfulness that raises this book above its peers. <br /> <br />NIGHTMARE, WITH ANGEL is dark without being pessimistic, and absorbing without basing itself on gimmicks.  This is a worthy thriller whose characters will appeal to readers who aren't crazy about this genre and whose plot will electrify those who are.  Gallagher's prose will raise the hairs on your head, while also giving your brain something to chew on.	2004-11-07
US	50631983	R33MFC653XICB	1903889103	158332553	Foreign Devils (Doctor Who)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Devilish fun	I'd never read any of William Hope Hodgson's Carnacki ghost stories, so before I checked out the main story, I decided to skip to the extra feature that this book contains -- an appendix featuring \\"The Whistling Room\\", an original short story from 1910 starring the early ghostbuster.  I really enjoyed it.  So much so that I definitely plan to seek out some more from Hodgson. <br /> <br />In any event, after getting a brief introduction to this character and his universe, I started reading the main story of the novella itself, a neat crossover of sorts between the Doctor Who world and the Carnacki world.  Cartmel's story doesn't have the same creepy, oppressive atmosphere of the Hodgson work, but I found it good on its own merits. <br /> <br />It's always interesting to see how an author attempts the notoriously difficult task of rendering the Second Doctor in print.  I've caught a few broadcasts of the Troughton serials on MPT recently, so I had his Doctor fresh in my mind.  I think Cartmel did a decent, if not quite wonderful, job of capturing him.  He doesn't exactly leap off the page, but I think if you have a good image of the character in your head, Cartmel's prose will just manage to coax him to the forefront. <br /> <br />For Jamie, Cartmel amusingly just removes him from the story and focuses his attention on Zoe.  This was a really good idea.  I don't know if his Jamie could possibly have been as entertaining as his Zoe.  Her stint as a Victorian maid is quite amusing.  It's a clich to have the futuristic (or modern) character(s) complaining about conditions for women and/or the lower classes when in historical settings, but Zoe's grumblings and the situation she gets herself into was too funny for words. <br /> <br />As for the story itself, it felt to me much more like a supernatural-tinged detective tale than the chilling, disturbing ghost story of \\"The Whistling Room\\" (however, I have no idea if \\"The Whistling Room\\" is typical).  But I appreciated itspace as the mystery was slowly revealed.  As a whole, it doesn't quite hold together completely at the end.  The individual set pieces are good, but the ending doesn't have the full impact that it should. <br /> <br />Still, while FOREIGN DEVILS isn't a great book, it is a good one.  It's absorbing and well written.  As a crossover, I'm not sure it's a complete success.  Carnacki doesn't seem to have the same impact on the story as, say, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson do in Andy Lane's ALL-CONSUMING FIRE.  Still, he makes for a decent addition to the cast, and his inclusion gives me a series of stories to track down.  FOREIGN DEVILS isn't as good as Cartmel's best work, but it is better than his worst.	2004-11-01
US	50631983	R2HZ0U2D4DT7EZ	0563486082	319370308	Doctor Who: Emotional Chemistry (Doctor Who (BBC Paperback))	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A scientific romance	EMOTIONAL CHEMISTRY is an intricately constructed book that wraps a simple core.  It's to Simon A. Forward's credit that he manages to keep his various plates in the air.  There's certainly a lot going on: a plot that takes place over three time zones, a largish number of important characters, etc.  But not only does it work, but it works extremely well.  This is one of the best stories that the EDAs have given us. <br /> <br />First of all, EMOTIONAL CHEMISTRY is a treat to read.  It comes across as a novel that was crafted with care and attention to detail.  Its prose has obviously been labored upon and gives it a strong, powerful voice.  And this is true for the book as a whole.  It's engaging, and fascinating.  Its characters come alive and there's an epic feel to the story which is effectively done considering how simple the heart of the story is. <br /> <br />Enough with the clichd praise phrases.  How did I like the book?  Well, as far as readability goes, I simply hated putting it down.  I, unfortunately, haven't had much time for reading lately, so I was forced to partake in small chunks at a time.  Although I loathed having to set the book aside, I think this was a good thing in the long-term.  This is a novel to be savored, not devoured, regardless of how readable it is.   <br /> <br />Forward's prose is certainly impressive.  There are neat observations, clever turns of phrase and amusing jokes all contained within superbly written sentences.  This is not hastily written hackwork, or even quickly flowing, enjoyable narration; this is prose that begs appreciation in its own right.  This is good writing. <br /> <br />And what is equally impressive is that it works on the macro as well as the micro level.  Stand back from the phrases and sentences, and you'll see a complicated but logical story unfolding.  A lot of what the author is doing is quite clever.  Splitting the action between three time periods (past, near-present, and far future) allows him manyfun comparisons.  Effectively handled are the different ways in which love and war are portrayed.  The relationships that crop up throughout the story make for an effective lead-in to the main \\"romance\\".  <br /> <br />Given that there are three main time zones and that each setting has its own cast of characters, it would be very easy for the author to mush things together creating bland, one-dimensional characters.  But he fails to fall into that trap.  Even the bit players are given life and credibility.  I'm also impressed by his depiction of Trix who, after an extremely shaky start, looks to become an extremely interesting companion (as an aside, I've begun visualizing her as blogger Wonkette). <br /> <br />Is there anything really to criticize here?  Well, it's nitpicking to be sure, but I didn't care for the quick cutting between scenes.  I realize it's a common feature of TV tie-in books; that doesn't mean I have to like it.  Come on!  I have an attention span!  I can follow a scene for more than a page without getting bored!  Forward is clearly better than others at this form of pacing, but it's still not something I enjoy. <br /> <br />Also, the sections taking place in the future seemed a bit vague to me.  I suppose all the reader needed to know is that there was a war taking place, but I never really got a handle on who was fighting and why.  I realize that this story takes its cue from the throwaway hints in TALONS OF WENG-CHIANG, yet that didn't really seem helpful as far as filling in the how's and why's.  Perhaps the mere existence of the future war was enough to drive the plot, but I couldn't help but feel that it paled in comparison to the scene setting that took place in the other two sections. <br /> <br />Minor flaws aside, there is really much to enjoy here.  And I'm at the point where I'm going to stop myself from simply listing out plot-points that I liked.  EMOTIONAL CHEMISTRY contains a combination that has been lacking in the BBC novels oflate -- both style and substance.  It's a grand tale told over multiple time zones, and different levels of reality, yet ultimately concerning one simple romance.  It's the sort of thing that one would think Doctor Who could do well, but very often doesn't.   I am very impressed with Simon A. Forward's talents as demonstrated in this novel.  His other two books have suddenly made great gains on my To-Read list.	2004-10-12
US	50631983	R1ASLJFXJYB2HW	0743254783	302007279	The Emerging Democratic Majority	Books	4	3	4	N	Y	Optimistic or Inevitable?	For a few months now, I've been a fan of Ruy Teixeira's Internet blog, so it was inevitable that I would get around to reading the book that the website is based upon.  His Internet writings may seem a little too optimistic at times, but one got the sense that he definitely knows what he's talking about when it comes to polling information.  THE EMERGING DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY is a sober and analytical look at the trends and growing demographics that the authors conclude will result in an era in which Democratic policies will become the view held by most voters.  The text gives a potted history of the Republicans and the Democrats during the course of the Twentieth Century, detailing when each party was at its highest and lowest points.  Given the trends and the positions of the parties, the authors project the future based on the present and the recent past. <br /> <br />The format (and indeed the research the book consists of) is based upon a well-respected book from the late 60s, THE EMERGING REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.  The authors of this book give credit where it's due; that earlier work was correct in its anticipation of what would become known as the Reagan Revolution.  But since the 90s, Judis and Teixeira state that we've entered a period of transition, where neither party has been able to forcefully dictate the national conversation.  The authors can only make predictions based on the available facts, but they make a very compelling argument.  They look at changing demographics, geographical trends (the \\"blue\\" states vs. the \\"red\\" states), and the political philosophies of the coalitions that currently make up both parties.   <br /> <br />The pillars of the Democratic party as it currently exists would seem to be much more in line with the general public than that of the Republicans, who are marginalizing themselves at a fairly fast rate.  There's a lot of information contained here, it's displayed clearly, and each argument is backed up with a wealth of statistical data.  Exit polling data and opinion polls make up a large part of their case, but an analysis of what ideas different groups of people seem most comfortable with is where the book is strongest.  They highlight the growth of \\"ideopolises\\", places where ideas and services rather than goods are the main sources of employment and revenue.  They see the growth of the \\"professional\\" class as the key to the Democrats' future as those people would appear to be much more open to that party's beliefs and much less happy with the direction of the Republican Party (dominated as it is by a weird and fracturing hybrid of neo-conservatives, religious fundamentalists, and anti-regulation economists). <br /> <br />While the model for what the near future will look like is the book's obvious and main selling point, I also found it informative to read the author's interpretation of the last century or so of political polling data.  Naturally, their focus is upon the immediate past, but contained here is a nice summary of where both parties have come from.  It's also very handy to have contained in one book a complete guide to all the regions of the United States and their current political stances.  TV pundits make broad statements about Gore States and Bush States, but as one can see here, it's a little more complicated than that. <br /> <br />The book may be a little more statistic and fact oriented than most political tomes, but I found that refreshing in itself.  The authors seem to be very much in favor of the \\"Progressive Centralism\\" that they predict will be the key to Democratic success, yet that dry enthusiasm never interferes with the objective facts concerning population and cultural changes.  This is recommended to anyone with an interest in where the future of United States politics is moving.	2004-10-11
US	50631983	R3RNXF5LFTUDMP	0140296476	263289727	Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Life, the Universe, and Nothing	ZERO: THE BIOGRAPHY OF A DANGEROUS IDEA is a book about literally nothing (thankfully, no Seinfeld references).  It's a non-fiction book dealing with some concepts that the layman may find difficult.  However, it's told with enough clarity and wit that the reader should never feel overwhelmed by the mathematical and scientific terminology.  Charles Seife does a fine job of balancing the explanations with the investigations.      I really enjoyed reading this book, though I should point out that I already liked mathematical topics beforehand.  Not that I was particularly gifted in mathematics in school, but the fun thing about reading books like this is that one can still think about and ponder the concepts without having to spend several hours a day doing repetitive busywork.      Seife delves deep into the origins of zero.  I found it fascinating to see exactly how some cultures simply had no need of zero and how others came to the idea with much resistance.  The religious, philosophical, mathematical and scientific ramifications of this discovery are discussed and never fail to be intriguing.      Although zero is what got on the cover and in the title, infinity plays a large part too.  The book goes on a short history of major paradigm changes in philosophy, math and physics, pointing out where zero and infinity played major roles in tearing down old schools of thought and building new ones.  Zero and infinity complement each other, and the history of zero would be incomplete without demonstrating how contemporaneous theories of infinity influenced it.    I should also mention the book's tone.  Although most people wouldn't think of a math text as a jolly read, this one would defy those expectations.  You have to admire any book that includes the sentence: \\"See appendix A for a proof that Winston Churchill was a carrot.\\"    Of course, humor and the whimsical flavor are only the icing.  I'll remember a lot of the pure information presented.  Some of it is meticulously analyzed, while some facts are just casually offered.  Although this is a relatively small book, it feels very dense (in the best possible way).  There's a lot here.    I applaud Seife's research and presentation.  While it would probably be difficult to make such interesting concepts boring, the writing here is anything but dry.  This is the perfect gift for those of us with an interest in math, but without the intense background needed to survive a more mathematician-focused tome.	2004-09-27

WOLFSBANE is one half whimsical fun and one half gothic horror.  It's a great action-adventure, paced strongly enough that it never becomes dull or tedious.  It's a straightforward story told with a lot of wit.  It's not the perfect Doctor Who novel, but it's one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. <br /> <br />WOLFSBANE is told in two parts simultaneously.  In the beginning, the Fourth Doctor and Sarah accidentally become separated from everyone's favorite bumbler, Harry Sullivan.  Harry wanders off into adventures of his own, quickly teaming up with the amnesiac Eighth Doctor in the middle of his Earth Arc.  Meanwhile, the Fourth Doctor and Sarah land a few weeks into the future trying to find a clue as to the whereabouts of their friend.  Generally speaking, Harry is the star of the first subplot, while Sarah gets the spotlight in the second.  Both strands concentrate on the same plot, as apparent werewolves terrorize the obligatory sleepy English village and its obligatory sleepy English sheep. <br /> <br />The two companions get the lion's share of the attention and they're both extremely well portrayed.  Sarah seemed much more alive than she did in the last PDA/MA I read that featured her (okay, that was EVOLUTION, but still...), appearing both capable, human, and certainly recognizable as her television counterpart.  But (and I'm not the first to point this out) the real revelation is Harry Sullivan.  I always liked this character and here, with virtually an entire half a book told from his point of view, he absolutely shines.  This is great!  His reactions are fun without being over the top and his thought patterns are magnificently entertaining.  This book deserves praise simply for Harry Sullivan's contribution alone.   <br /> <br />Few of the other characters come alive quite like the companions do, although I found Emmeline's story touching.  The eventual villains just barely manage to avoid falling over the cliff of clich, buteven at their worst, they're still endearing. <br /> <br />This sort of narrative structure where the story takes place in two coupled time zones is not wholly original to this book.  But it's a fun gimmick as well as rare in Doctor Who novels and therefore a welcome addition.  Rayner plays with her narrative; for instance, at the beginning of Sarah's subplot we're given some giant clues as to what will happen at the end of Harry's story.  The result is a success.  My only real quibble with this is that the changeovers tend to jar.  She has a habit of jumping from scene to scene quite haphazardly, and it can be difficult at first to figure out which time zone a given sequence is taking place in. <br /> <br />The other slight distraction I found is that the two halves of the story are told in different styles, although the more I think about them in this way, the more I'm seeing how the two parts informed each other.  For the most part, the Harry Sullivan subplot is a fun action-adventure thriller, where well-meaning Harry plays Nigel Bruce to the Eighth Doctor's Basil Rathbone.  The werewolf portions are mostly the stuff of horror films and pulp novels.  On the other hand, the Sarah Jane Smith subplot deals more with the psychological aspects of the werewolf menace as well as getting a little deeper into Sarah's head.  One feels lightweight and fluffy, while the other goes for a more gritty approach, which can be a little disconcerting when alternating in rapid succession.  (For an example of what I'm talking about, look at the opposing ways in which the book approaches food and physical distresses.  There's a descriptive passage where Sarah, who hasn't eaten for a while, hungrily longs for any sustenance.  And in a later scene she almost freezes to death.  But on the other hand, the only similar scene in Harry Sullivan's adventure is where the sideburned one encounters a situation where he must think hard to remember which fork to use at a formal dinner.) <br /> <br />I started off the previous paragraph as a complaint, but the more I think about it, the more appealing I'm finding Rayner's delivery.  She's really played up the strengths of both characters and gave each an aspect of the story most suited for them.  She approaches the basic werewolf tale from two angles and gets the most out of each.  It's something that I didn't appreciate while I was actually reading the book, but it's something I've now been dwelling on afterwards.  The styles may have clashed somewhat, but now that I think about it, I feel it was worth it.  The pieces that the two subplots have in common do go some way towards smoothing out the rough patches. <br /> <br />Apart from that, I found this a really fun adventure.  The descriptions are quite good, and Rayner's prose is certainly compelling.  It isn't the greatest writing ever seen in a Who novel, but I'd place it above the average.  The ending I found a bit confusing (and I'm not sure I quite understood one aspect of it), but it was nothing that marred my overall enjoyment.	2004-09-22
US	50631983	RJR46NMW3B9XU	0563486074	474210625	Doctor Who: Timeless	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Time to end this story-arc	If I were to review this book in a couple of phrases, I'd describe it as a mediocre novel with an atrocious ending.  Unfortunately, I'm far too grumpy to simply leave it at that.  TIMELESS is a frustrating book in a series that I've been increasingly frustrated with.  A multi-part story-arc really shouldn't be interfering in an individual book to the extent seen here, yet that's exactly what happens.  The story-arc should enhance an individual tale, not drag it down to the depths of incomprehensibility. <br /> <br />The back cover states the plot involves \\"saving the multiverse from total collapse\\".  Well, this doesn't exactly increase the dramatic tension for me.  I mean, first of all, any reader is going to take it for granted that the book doesn't end with the multiverse in a state of total collapse.  So the state of play isn't where the book is going to be setting its conflict.  What we're left with is to observe how the Doctor saves the universe (or multiverse or whatever).  Here's where we have the problem.  The threat to the universe has been described with ever increasing gobs of technobabble over the past few books in the series.  And it doesn't take a genius to realize that the best way of ridding the world of technobabble is to attack it with even more confusing technobabble.  This is not something I enjoy reading. <br /> <br />Now, I'll give Stephen Cole some credit here.  When addressing conflicts that potentially alter the entire course of creation, it's handy to see the effect that these Big Events have on actual living people.  Made-up science-stuff that doesn't even remain consistent from book to book can be a little -- shall we say -- difficult to grasp.  So it's nice to see time spent on developing characters.  Stacy, for instance, worked quite well for me, and I enjoyed her subplot as well as her character (if the whole book had worked like this, I would have rated it much higher). <br /> <br />On the other hand, I was more lukewarm to Guy.  He'sa fairly standard character, but I suspect that's done deliberately.  If you like this sort of thing, then you call him an everyman.  If you loathe it, then you call him a walking stereotype.  My opinion moved back and forth between the two extremes.  I think my main problem was just that Cole's attempt at making him a sympathetic and identifiable figure went a bit too far and I couldn't actually imagine anyone this generic really existing.  I note that other reviewers have had no trouble identifying with him at all, so it appears the mileage varies on this point. <br /> <br />As for the plot, for the most part Cole is capable of keeping the individual strands separate and interesting.  I really liked Fitz and Trix's investigation taking place a number of weeks removed from the main action.  But there are way too many little moments where Cole has to cheat in order to allow the plot to emerge in the way he wants it to.  Take for example the Doctor and Stacy escaping because the bad guys just throw them off a boat, let them get away and only then do they think to give chase.  Sloppy and regrettable.  And as for the conversation two grown male characters have about women...  well, I'm speechless in my amusement.  It reads like a conversation that two twelve-year-old boys would have about girls, but only in the unlikely event that they didn't know any dirty words. <br /> <br />But the biggest problem is that I simply cannot care about the book's main conflict.  Now don't get me wrong; I like science fiction that handles big scientific ideas.  I have no trouble with the idea of a story doing big things with the universe.  But this never felt like \\"Big Ideas\\".  This felt more like \\"More Made Up Mumbo Jumbo From The People Who Brought You That Other Made Up Mumbo Jumbo.\\"  If there hadn't been any silly story-arc stuff going on and the book had been focused upon the human villains, I'm sure I would have been very positive about it. <br /> <br />I sort of enjoyed reading the first half, but after a while it just wore me down.  It also feels far less ambitious than his previous EDA, despite dealing with huge universe-shattering events.  VANISHING POINT was an exploration of a society with apparent proof as to existence of the afterlife.  It may not have fulfilled its potential, but I admired it for trying.  TIMELESS, on the other hand, is about what happens when overwhelming technobabble meets unstoppable gobbledygook.  It may not have started out that way, but unfortunately, that's how it ended.	2004-09-13
US	50631983	R2V4DF6DSWTEJY	0563538635	644674686	The Infinity Race (Doctor Who)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The Pace-Eater	Due to a variety of reasons, I found myself with a long gap between the publication of this book and my eventual perusal.  During that pause, Internet opinion had pretty much decided that THE INFINITY RACE was a hugely disappointing clunker at the end of what had been a breathtaking and fantastic year for the Eighth Doctor Adventures.  So, when I did start reading this book, it was with some slight trepidation.  At first, it appeared that my anxiety was misplaced.  The beginning drew me in, tempted my appetite and consistently impressed me; I couldn't fathom why it was receiving such negative press.  But by the time I got to the end, I found that the book had fizzled somewhat.  While it's certainly not what I would consider terrible, it does seem to be lacking a certain something that would raise this book above the level of ordinary. <br /> <br />The story opens with an invitation of sorts left over from the previous EDA (Justin Richards' TIME ZERO).  Sabbath lures the Doctor and friends to one of the biggest races in the galaxy: a regatta situated on the ocean-planet Selonart (a name that I was certain was a joke or a reference to something else, but I have so far failed at figuring out what that is).  These competitions reach a galaxy-wide audience, in part because of the strange properties present in the oceans of this world.  The water is mostly frictionless and \\"light\\", and specially designed ships can travel on the seas at speeds unheard of on Earth. <br /> <br />The special attributes of the water on Selonart allow Simon Messingham to delve into some hard science-fiction concepts, though thankfully he doesn't dive in too deep.  Messingham produces some good old-fashioned nautical adventuring without too much in the way of distracting technobabble.  The opening sections that take place primarily on the yachts are genuinely thrilling and exciting.  Messingham's skills of being able to construct a good horror sequence (which were on display on the underrated and creepy THE FACE-EATER) are put to good use in these portions, giving us some sharp and unsettling prose. <br /> <br />Many people have commented on the narrative voice(s) used in this book, usually saying that they found it distracting or unpleasant.  My reaction was the complete opposite.  I loved the actual process of reading this book.  The jokes were funny, the action sequences executed smoothly, and the plot was laid out competently.  But yet, I'm still not exactly sure why everything didn't seem to feel quite right by the end.  I'd been drawn in to the narrative, but not into the rest of the story.  I found the actual sentences and paragraphs to be deceptively adept at getting me to keep turning the pages.  And I can't deny that the storyline of the book was similarly impressive and interesting.  But somewhere along the line, Messingham lost my interest.   <br /> <br />The characters are another aspect of this book that I can't say that I loved or hated.  There's enough material present for me to want to keep reading about them, but there's not quite enough for me to say that they were three-dimensional characters in their own right.  That said, the narrative first-person switches to Fitz and Anji's viewpoints were extremely well done.  I really would like to see more of this sort of thing in the Doctor Who books.  The companions are almost always designed to be our identification points, so it's nice to get inside their heads once in a while.  Messingham does a terrific job at keeping the characters distinct, consistent and genuine.  Even as I find myself growing weary of Fitz, books like this one make me want to see the current team go on together for a long time. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I can indeed say that I found THE INFINITY RACE to be a vaguely decent read.  As in Messingham's previous EDA, his prose did a wonderful job of building tension within individual scenes.  Unlike that book however, the whole just didn't quite hang together enough for me.Given all that I liked about this book, I really should have enjoyed the total experience more than I did -- but I didn't.  And it's a shame, because there's much here to appreciate.	2004-09-01
US	50631983	RIJTXGD0G7PLH	0300101716	143729112	Inventing A Nation: Washington, Adams, Jefferson	Books	3	5	11	N	N	Detailed, but unfocused	In INVENTING A NATION, Gore Vidal focuses upon the creation of the Constitution of the United States and upon the key figures who fashioned that momentous document (with the main thrust concerning Washington, Adams and Jefferson).  It is a large undertaking, and one which is only partially successful.  Vidal offers a lot of historical details and anecdotes, pulling in quotes from letters, speeches and writings straight from the horse's pen, as it were.  But his presentation leaves much to be desired.  I learned a fair number of facts while reading this, yet I don't feel I really gained any new insights into this important time in US history. <br /> <br />One of the main things I didn't care for was the fact that Vidal presents a lot of quotations but a majority offers no hint as to the context in which they are delivered.  I'm not accusing him of making things up or even twisting the words of the Founding Fathers.  However, it's difficult to really understand what the meaning is behind the sentences when we don't know where they came from.  Are these public speeches meant to put an opinion in the best possible light or private letters in which inner thoughts are revealed?  The origin and emphasis has a huge effect on how the modern reader should interpret them. <br /> <br />The narrative voice meanders all over the place, moving from one event to the other, regardless of linear progression or actual relevance.  I'm certain that there must have been some order behind the presentation of these passages, but there were times when I just couldn't see it.  Hell, there were times when I was having trouble following it. <br /> <br />That said, the portions dealing with single morsels of history come across very well.  There are many fascinating particulars scattered throughout -- a lot of things that I had never heard of before.  In a handful of places he compares and contrasts a historical topic to a more modern event (say, the Presidential Election of 2000).  I found these to be intriguing insights.  I know that some people would prefer that nothing recent at all even be mentioned in a history text, but history repeats itself and to ignore the author's own opinions about a given parallel would be dishonest.  Nor did I find him terribly unbiased in that regard; he seems equally grumpy about all things modern. <br /> <br />I think the ultimate superficiality of this book becomes most apparent when one first picks it up and notices that the text only runs to one hundred, eighty-nine pages (with suspiciously large spacing between lines).  Gore Vidal is a gifted writer and storyteller, meaning that the individual anecdotes and details are written in an engrossing and whimsical fashion.  Yet the text as a whole has the feeling of something written without a starting outline and without a second draft.  It comes across as history written as stream-of-consciousness.  The little stories are fascinating, but the big picture is lost.	2004-09-01
US	50631983	R3LMR1EIFIODRX	0426204220	999293176	Evolution (Doctor Who : The Missing Adventures)	Books	2	4	5	N	N	A few generations away from a good thriller	I was prepared to cut EVOLUTION a lot of slack.  Since I wasn't in the mood for anything dense or heavy, I figured a John Peel action-adventure might be just what I was seeking.  For a time, I was correct.  Despite the book's many obvious flaws, I willingly gave it the benefit of the doubt.  But, at the end of the day, there's only so much slack one can cut, and before I reached the conclusion my limit was reached.  I crossed the boundary about thirty pages before Doyle blurts out, \\"This is all getting far too preposterous for me.\\"  By the time I got there, I felt his pain. <br /> <br />Getting down to basics, the characterization of the Fourth Doctor and Sarah is actually quite strong when the two of them are bantering together.  Peel has clearly spent some time studying how Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen performed off each other.  But problems occur when the two characters are separated.  Who are these people?  His Fourth Doctor and Sarah are reasonably apt at throwing tame insults at the other, but when did they start threatening their adversaries (and innocent bystanders) with all manner of physical abuse?  It continues a trend I've noticed in other Peel novels.  He seems to equate strong and/or forceful characteristics with physical brutality.  Strong people push weak people around.  Therefore, the Fourth Doctor isn't just a masterful detective and righter of wrongs; he states on numerous occasions that he \\"takes great delight\\" in beating up villains.  Sarah Jane Smith isn't just a strong-willed person who speaks her mind; she demonstrates these attributes by threatening to scratch out someone's eyes.  It's disconcerting to say the least. <br /> <br />I think one of the bigger flaws is that there is little of substance behind the book's actions.  The author borrows a lot of the style of early science fiction and detective stories, but it seems like a cheap faade on a structure with no real foundation.  WAR OF THE WORLDS, to take an example, contains a surfaceof science fiction action-adventure.  Yet on another level it also has much to say on the subject of British colonialism.  The original Sherlock Holmes stories demonstrated the power of logic and reason.  Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN warned Mankind not to meddle in God's domain.  You can argue the merits of these messages, but the important thing to note is that there were underlying themes holding the action together.  Just what on Earth is EVOLUTION saying?  It has a plot concerning genetic manipulation and the alternation of natural evolution.  But what is it saying about these issues?  Nothing that I can see.  What is gained by having the Doctor perform a Sherlock Holmes impersonation in front of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?  Apart from working in a bunch of Sherlock Holmes in-jokes, nothing.  Why is a young Rudyard Kipling even in this novel?  Any annoying teenager could be substituted with no real alterations. <br /> <br />Although this novel feels like a cobbled together bunch of disparate pieces placed together in hopes that the reader will find at least something to latch on to, you could almost accept it as pure mindless adventure, if only it wasn't quite so clumsy.  It's full of annoying little things like Sarah spending valuable time trying to figure out who the book's villain is when the answer is obvious.  Hint to Sarah: it's the only other character that it could possibly be!  This is not a novel with multiple possible bad guys, where the protagonist must choose between suspects by careful application of logic and reason.  This is a novel where there simply aren't enough characters around to attract suspicion.  It's like if Hercule Poirot were trapped on the Orient Express with only one other passenger and still taking three hundred pages to figure out whodunit. <br /> <br />There are just too many instances of people doing things solely to drive the plot forward.  It holds together competently on a quick read through, but flipping back I noticed plot threads I assumed would have been tied up by the end still were left dangling.  Moral complexity and character exploration are not the book's strong features.  Sarah takes a few paragraphs battling with the fiercely complex question of \\"Is Breckinridge a good guy... or a bad guy?\\"  You'd imagine that she went to the Maxwell Smart School of Ethical Theory.  One could read this as an undemanding book for children if it weren't for the bizarre (and unneeded) references to child molestation. <br /> <br />On page 62, one character laughingly states: \\"Well, every good story starts with 'Once upon a time...'\\".  I couldn't help but flip back to the beginning to see if EVOLUTION begins with that phrase.  As I'm sure you've guessed, it doesn't.  I've written mostly concerning the novel's flaws, but it's worth pointing out that I reasonably enjoyed reading much of it.  But at a point, I simply couldn't ignore the problems anymore.  Good pacing and reasonably entertaining action can't make up for a bookful of flaws.	2004-08-17
US	50631983	R1QXXNT1RX5YH	0441007317	101055477	The Left Hand of Darkness (Ace Science Fiction)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	The Right Hand of Elegance	At about the halfway point, I thought that THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS was an okay novel, but not a great one.  However, by the time I arrived at the end, trudging through the ice and snow with Ai and Estraven, I found that my opinion had grown more positive.  I'm still not quite convinced that it's the awesome and overwhelming classic that its reputation would suggest, but I can definitely see how it has received a lot of its praise. <br /> <br />The book's plot is quite thin; the story is more concerned with world-building and character exploration than it is about events.  The universe that Le Guin creates is where the book has its biggest successes and its most notable failure.  The planet of Winter and the story of the one man sent to make first contact from a galactic alliance are extremely well realized, as is the society that human Genly Ai encounters in his travels.  Their customs are sufficiently alien, yet rational; their non-human physiology is reflected upon in fine detail without becoming belabored; their squabbles and political wranglings are interesting; and their environment is described in depth.  These portions of the story are a pleasure to read. <br /> <br />Where the book falls down, I believe, is in the sections told from the point of view of the aliens themselves.  A big deal is made out of the fact that for most days of the month, they are neither one gender nor the other, only becoming man or woman for a few days of their reproductive cycle.  But while the actions they take reflect this substantial difference, the way they think doesn't.  There's really no difference in style between the first person narrations of Ai and Estraven.  Le Guin goes through a lot of pain to describe the pure facts of what a non-gender person would be like, yet can't quite convey the emotional responses.  This is a pity, mostly because she did such a great job bringing to life all the other details. <br /> <br />Still, while that one portion of the book frustratedme, I found a lot to enjoy in the rest of it.  The bulk of the story concerns the relationship between the visitor, Ai, and the insufficiently alien, but realistically human Estraven.  They play off each other well and it's fun to see the waxing and waning amounts of trust the two have in each other as the story progresses. <br /> <br />Back when this was published in 1969, the message that gender wasn't really that important in determining one's station in live was probably considered a bit more sophisticated than it is today.  Nowadays such an announcement seems rather obvious.  Still, the book's other themes (such as the importance of loyalty and trust) have aged much better, and, in fact, the discussions on the exact meanings of nationalism and patriotism seem very apt in today's political climate.  This turned out to be a very rewarding read in the end, so if you find yourself getting stuck in the middle, I'd recommend that you keep going.  The book as a whole is certainly worth it.	2004-08-10
US	50631983	RNRNOMOC5EHSL	0563486058	290430073	Doctor Who: The Last Resort	Books	1	7	8	N	N	I think rhyme and reason just fell apart.	I'm actually shocked by how much I disliked THE LAST RESORT.  Paul Leonard is an author I have a lot of time for.  I found something to enjoy in all of his previous NAs/EDAs (yes, even THE DREAMSTONE MOON which is almost universally loathed).  Yet outside the first few chapters, I didn't enjoy any of it.  There's just not much here to like.  Stuff happens.  None of it to people we're interested in.  Then more stuff happens.  Not much of it makes sense.  Then the book ends.  Readers are left, scratching their heads, wondering why on Earth this book exists.  Maybe it doesn't.  Maybe I imagined it.  Once the scars heal and the memory fades, I doubt I'll ever have any reason to want to go back and prove that this book really was published. <br /> <br />There's a strong beginning to the story.  We actually have a plot that fits comfortably into the on-going story-arc; without the Time Lords to enforce the Laws Of Time, dangerous and destructive time travel is appearing.  \\"Destructive\\", because of the havoc inadvertently unleashed upon the cosmos.  Alternative universes are springing up with each instance of time travel (at least, that's what the book says, although unexplained exceptions are made).  Any time traveler changing history is now responsible for the existence of two time-streams -- the first being his original time-stream (the unmolested chain of events that led to his time travel), the second being the altered, new time-stream (the new and improved version which may in fact be a paradox).  The book's most successful moments involve the comedy potential of having all manner of modern-day icons turning up in human history. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with this book is that it's obvious by about page fifty that this state of affairs can't remain true and there's clearly going to be a reset of one sort or another before the book closes.  \\"But\\", I hear some of you saying, \\"Surely what's important is the journey itself, not necessarily what we arrive at.\\"  Andusually I would agree with that sentiment.  But this journey itself is technobabble-laden nonsense.  Most of it probably makes logical sense, but it's difficult to care about any of it.  We're told that Sabbath's nonsensical plan to fix everything will work, but we aren't told why or given any information that would let us figure it out. <br /> <br />We're told that alternative universes are popping up every time someone (off-screen) makes a change to history.  So, how often is this occurring?  How many time-streams are created during the first, say, one hundred pages?  Does each inconsistency point to a newer history?  Are there new universes created without immediately noticeable effects?  Are new universes being created with every chapter?  Every scene?  Every page?  Every sentence?  As far as I can tell, each of these could be true, but we aren't told why or given any information that would let us figure it out. <br /> <br />So, given that the majority of the book is simply extended padding, is there anything worth reading in the bulk of pages that makes up THE LAST RESORT?  Sadly, no.  In the past, Leonard has done a reasonably good job of presenting solid characterization.  At times, he's done astonishingly well on this point.  But not here.  His characters simply cannot overcome the \\"plot\\" that they're mired in.  The only exception is a bright spot in the character of Iyeeye.  Leonard is playing to his strengths here.  I found her thoughts while in her own environment to be engrossing.  The problem is that the story is far too splintered for a deep character like this.  She's stuck in something that is impossible to care about and unfortunately the effect is to dull any interest she may have brought. <br /> <br />One of the advantages to creating a whole bunch of identical duplicates is that it allows the author opportunity to kill off characters as many times as he likes without having to bother creating new ones.  Oh boy.  But yet, maybe seeing exactly howa beloved character may choose to sacrifice himself in one reality would give us further insight into the still-living character in another time-line.  It's a nice idea... that only happens once (Anji's journal).  The literally thousands of other deaths are just pointless.  In the MST3k episode \\"Time Chasers\\", a movie which shares the same philosophy of time travel as this novel, one copy of our bespectacled, big-chinned, hockey-haired hero is blown away.  \\"Don't worry, folks\\", mocks one of the robots wearily, \\"This movie's got a spare.\\"  Oh, you wouldn't believe the amount of times I thought of that line during THE LAST RESORT. <br /> <br />The plot eventually turns back on itself.  Maybe.  Something inexplicable that occurs near the beginning finally gets a time-travely explanation towards the end although I'm not convinced that the link-up actually matters.  It would be more impressive if there was any reason to care by that point or any reason to believe that they were all part of the same universe or time-line or whatever.  So something matches up.  So what?  It's been mere days since I read the book and I'm already struggling to remember why key plot points took place.  This novel is the poster child for demonstrating that a convoluted plot is no replacement for a complex one.  A complex plot is one in which multiple layers are carefully interweaved -- characterization, plot and tone all work together to enhance the author's chosen themes.  A convoluted plot is one in which weird stuff happens just because the author says so.  It may all make sense by the end, but it might not.  And you might not even be able to tell anyway.  <br /> <br />I have absolutely no problem with a storyline that requires me to give it a lot of thought.  But I balk when that extra thinking leads only to the discovery of plot-holes, inconsistencies and sloppiness.  This is not Paul Leonard's finest hour.	2004-08-09
US	50631983	R1ZGOD3IOWNISC	0679450041	383312801	The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay: A Novel	Books	2	31	40	N	N	This super-hero can't fly	If THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY had ended at page two hundred, I would almost certainly have spent this review raving about how excellent it was. A short, snappy volume about the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the comic-book industry, relating that story properly in the backdrop of World War II would have been a tremendous read. Unfortunately, what we actually get is a six hundred, thirty-six page tome that meanders and weaves unsurely around its potentially good premise. I can forgive a lot in a novel, but this did two things that I cannot stand: it insulted my intelligence and it was absurdly manipulative for no good reason. <br />  <br /> The opening is the most worthy section, being both entertaining and captivating. A Jewish teenager by the name of Joseph Kavalier escapes from real life horrors -- Europe in the dark days of 1939, where genocidal terrors are taking place. Once in the safety of New York, he teams up with his cousin, Sam Clay, to create a fictional comic-book superhero whose main ability is his inherent knack of escaping from fictional dangers. Their character goes by the name of The Escapist, and it is this portion of the book that brings me to my first big problem. <br />  <br /> In the opening portions, the themes and metaphors are painted with a light stroke. But as the book progresses, Chabon obviously looses faith in the reader's ability to understand how clever he's being, so he starts having characters explain things that should be self-evident. This really annoys me. I can see exactly how, say, a character's relationship with a close relative can be reflected in their creations. I can see exactly how the real-life situations were intruding on Kavalier and Clay's fictional universes. I do not need these obvious parallels pointed out to me in a clumsy and obvious fashion. I do not need the characters themselves spelling out the book's themes. Show, don't tell. <br />  <br /> This awkwardness brings us to my second main objection and that is the author resorts to stock clich?s and unoriginal storylines in order to emotionally manipulate the audience into having a given reaction. Authors do this all the time, to varying effects, but one instance here is particularly odd, given that any sane member of the audience is already going to fully and completely agree. There's absolutely no need to string everyone along for the two hundred or so pages and finally resolve that particular subplot with such banality. And it's not just one situation that he confines this to. A plethora of issues are given the same ham-fisted treatment. The frustrating thing for me was that I broadly agreed with many of the points he was making, but I balk at someone using such patently unsubtle methods.  <br />  <br /> Another thing I disliked was the way that Chabon kept using his &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; card. Every time he wrote himself into a corner, he would cheat and ignore the consequences of his characters' actions by either fast-forwarding in time or simply having the pivotal character absent from a given part of the story. Yes, I realize that this is utterly in keeping with the theme of escapism, but just because a theme is consistent, it does not follow that it is satisfying. <br />  <br /> It's just too scattershot to be truly agreeable. We're all over the map on this one, literally as well as figuratively. We're in Prague, we're in New York, we're in the suburbs, we're in the Antarctic, we're in Guantanamo Bay, we're back in the suburbs, we're drawing comic books, we're single-handedly raiding German bases, etc, etc. I wasn't a comic-book reader when I was a child, so perhaps there's some deliberate aping of that genre that I'm just not understanding. But I was just baffled by the books inability to focus. Not only are we not fixed on any given setting or plot structure, the characters themselves wander in and out at seemingly random intervals. And the ending I found to be quite distasteful as well aslaughably unrealistic. I won't give anything away, but the child's reaction is just wrong, wrong, wrong. <br />  <br /> I'm ultimately saddened that I found so much to dislike about this book, because I did find a hell of a lot to enjoy. There are some simply marvelous pieces of writing scattered throughout the book. The action-adventure portions dealing with the escape from Prague are exciting; the tender portions later in the book are genuinely emotional. The little observations and certain selections of prose I found utterly delightful. In fact, even with all the negative things I've had to say about this, I think I'll go pick up some of Chabon's earlier works, as other reviews have lead me to believe that they're more focused. I really enjoyed much of his writing, and if he does indeed retain his concentration in those novels, I think I'll be the happier for it. But KAVALIER AND CLAY is not such a novel. I found the last two-thirds of the book to be a snowballing chunk of disappointment, made all the more shocking by how excellent the beginning was. I can't know for sure, but this definitely looks like the result of what happens when editors are scared to edit. <br />	2004-07-23
US	50631983	R7JZWZ0Y7WIOV	014200202X	694137922	Casino Royale (James Bond Novels)	Books	2	7	21	N	N	A Royale With Cheese	I'm not the world's biggest fan of the James Bond movies, although I do enjoy them a bit.  I've seen a handful of them in the cinema, and will gladly watch one on TV on a Sunday afternoon if there's no football on.  But I'd heard good things about the novel series that the movies were based on and I was curious to see how James Bond worked in print.  I'll probably read more books in the series, because I liked the style, but my overall impression of CASINO ROYALE, the first James Bond novel, was negative.<br />The plot revolves around the need for government agent James Bond to beat a Russian spy decisively at the Baccarat table in a ritzy casino/vacation resort.  It doesn't get much more complicated than that, although the sections of the book involving the initial stakeout and the game itself are satisfying and competent.  They seem to be very influenced by the pulp thrillers that had come in years past, though they bring little new to the table.  They're fun though.  My main problem came once the initial conflict has been resolved, all the way at the two-thirds point.  The final third of the book involves a bizarre romance and an even stranger set of ruminations on good vs. evil.  This section is, to be frank, childishly inept, and ruins any good will I had stored up from the casino plot.  Yes, deliberations on what separates agents working for the &quot;good&quot; guys and spies working for &quot;evil&quot; governments is an interesting idea and one which has sparked numerous thought-provoking debates and discussions.  But this isn't one of them.<br />James Bond himself isn't terribly developed yet; I assume his persona would become better established in subsequent novels.  He's humorless, moody and drab.  I never really felt there was enough to get a grip on the character.  The rest of the cast are sketchy as well.  Of course, since most of them are lesser agents who only show up when they have a plot point to fill, that's to be expected.  Bond's love interestreceives more characterization from her slinky portrait on the cover than from anything that appears in the pages.<br />To be honest, I'm faintly surprised to hear rumors of Hollywood producers wishing to film this (on the premise that it's the last James Bond novel that hasn't been faithfully adapted to the screen).  It seems to me it would be rather dull after the excesses recently displayed in the movies.  There's only one explosion, a relatively tame car chase sequence, no helicopters, jet-planes, or space vehicles.  In short, it's comparatively tame.  Hopefully they'll adapt the better parts of the book (the gambling and casino intrigue) and cut out the bad (the last sixty or so pages).  Merging the book's successes with the better-established characters may result in an entertaining film, but it has its work cut out for it if it wants to be great.	2004-06-26
US	50631983	R4S1ROUJYK5HH	0563486031	666385586	Doctor Who: Reckless Engineering	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Plot Engineering	I've read the argument stating science fiction stories have fewer interesting people in them because the author must spend so much extra time setting up their alien and/or futuristic worlds, they have less time to spend developing believable characters.  I'm not sure I agree that this is a necessary or inherent failing in science fiction, although I must admit it does successfully describe a phenomena that occurs with some regularity.  And I think the heuristic it expresses goes double for alternative universe stories.  The author must not only evoke the real-world historical and physical setting, but he or she must also spend time meticulously explaining how, why and in what way it differs from our own Earth, leaving even less time for the story's characters.  This may explain how Nick Walters could present us with a very detailed look at an alternative Bristol, 2003, yet populate it entirely with cardboard.<br />I found much to enjoy in RECKLESS ENGINEERING, but character development was not one of those pleasures.  I wouldn't have minded so much (I'm perfectly capable of appreciating a plot-intensive story which exists at the expense of character), except that the book kept making half-assed efforts at injecting life into these people.  There's a bizarre love-triangle subplot handled so clumsily that I wondered why the author bothered including it.  The supporting characters are uniformly bland, with the sole exception of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.  IKB is, of course, a historical figure, although one which I don't know a lot about, so I'm unsure how faithful this portrayal is.  However, he works well here; the grumpy engineer is exactly what the story needed.<br />Despite not caring much for the characters, I found myself racing through the book's second half much faster than I expected.  The reason for this was that I was completely engrossed in the plot and shot through it intent on finding out what was coming next.  The TARDIS crew has landed in an alternative,post-apocalyptic 21st century, where the last remains of humanity have been slowly rebuilding their world for the past hundred and sixty years.  There's a lone mansion that seems to hold the key to the mystery of how history became corrupted, and there's apparent alien influence in that situation.  There's a hell of a lot going on, and while it's generally presented very well, I felt the ending was a bit short.  Careful reading and going back to reread earlier passages suggested to me that everything necessary was actually there, it was just a bit rushed.  It could have benefited from an extra ten or so pages, hopefully without unduly disturbing the pacing.<br />Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that we are not shying away from the consequences of the Doctor's actions.  Putting the timeline (or space-time continuum or whatever it is) back to its proper state means having to wipe out these alternatives that are springing up.  Remember how this was hand-waved in the final few pages of BLOOD HEAT, way back in the New Adventure days?  Thankfully, we are getting a little more discussion concerning these side effects of the alternative universe arc than we did the last time.  Walters puts the argument in favor of fixing the universe in the mouth of the Doctor (as it should be), while leaving the &quot;what about...?&quot; and &quot;doesn't that mean...?&quot; questions for Fitz to ask.  This arrangement seems to work quite well.  The audience realizes that the Doctor may be ultimately correct in his assessment, but that doesn't stop us from thinking the same questions that occur to Fitz, and it's only right that the book should address them in this way.  I quite like how Walters handled this.<br />There are some wonderful descriptive passages detailing how Bristol has changed in this alternative timeline.  Walters wipes out a huge percentage of the world's population in the 19th Century, and then flashes forward to the 21st to see what the world would look like afterthat amount of time had passed.  He spends a lot of time mapping out this universe, describing what the population has become and how the physical world has decayed.  And he balances out these lovingly written pieces of very effective prose with violent scenes that are almost cartoonish in their banality.  I think this strange counterpoint sums up my opinion of the book as a whole: stunningly great in some places, but truly painful in others.<br />I liked Nick Walter's prose style, something I don't remember being particularly tickled by in his previous books.  I was taken by his ability to create a genuinely oppressive and depressive atmosphere, and then to momentarily break the mood with a clever joke.  Not to give away any punch lines, but I loved the bit near the end about the poet who isn't famous.<br />Despite some fairly serious problems, I did ultimately enjoy RECKLESS ENGINEERING.  The pacing is just right.  We leave events just before they can become tedious.  For example, the storyline concerning the settlements is relegated to the sidelines in the book's second half (prior to it become stale) and the plot then becomes a series of time-travel hops.  Since so much of the book's successes revolve around its plot, I wonder if I'll care for it as much the second time I read it when I'll already know how things unfold.  Perhaps it won't be a book with much longevity, but it's a bit too soon for me to make that judgment.  On my first reading though, I thought it was a pretty decent book.	2004-06-26
US	50631983	R2PPSPVUIHKNC4	0345404475	978657248	Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?: The inspiration for the films Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049	Books	4	5	9	N	N	Apocalyptic dreaming towards a futuristic day	DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? is another classic science fiction novel that I only just got around to reading.  And once again, I find myself wishing that I'd gotten around to reading it earlier.  It was also my introduction to the writings of Philip K. Dick, and I also wish I had started exploring his output before now.  This novel demonstrates what science fiction can do at its best.  It tells an absorbing, thrilling story, but it also works on other levels.  <br />The book's protagonist is named Rick Deckard, and he's a police officer in a post-apocalyptic future whose job is to track down and destroy rouge androids.  Although this is clearly a science fiction work, I felt a strong flavor of noir creeping throughout the sections dealing with Deckard's career.  The trappings of the fantastic are present, but they're presented in a clearly thriller-type way.  Deckard may be a cop from the future, yet he owes a lot of his characterization to the hardboiled, fictional detectives who came before him.  This makes him an extremely entertaining character, as well as an immediately sympathetic one.<br />As has been noted, this novel is doing a little more than just telling another adventure story (although it does a great job at that).  While the themes of alienation and isolation and what it means to be a conscious, reasoning entity are well-developed and much discussed by readers, several other metaphors are also lurking beneath the surface.  This is a book very much influenced by its time (it was published 1968), but pieces of it seem almost timeless (the war which nearly destroys the world is caused by a right-wing policy group wielding too much influence at the Pentagon; boy, does that sound familiar).  The psychological testing done on the subjects to determine their identity (either human or robot) reminded me strongly of the infamous McCarthy hearings. <br />I was very impressed by the actual writing itself in this novel.  Dick's prose is very strong.  Science fiction writers often enjoy building up a new world/universe at the expense of characterization or plot, but that isn't the case here.  He excels at painting a bleak future, taking the attitudes of today and projecting them into a world with few people and fewer animals.  But he doesn't let this overwhelm the book.  It's a hard balance to maintain, yet he manages it well.  His satire is exactly what it should be: both hilarious and cuttingly accurate.  <br />Philip K. Dick is a writer that I've heard a lot of good things about, and I'm looking forward to diving deeper into his back catalog.  DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? impressed me in both its straightforward narrative and in the deeper topics that it touches on.  The \\"social commentary\\" aspect of the novel, which can be painful in books by lesser authors, is actually one of the book's best features.  There are a few sloppy points (the mechanical capabilities of the androids are a bit vaguely defined, and once or twice characters talk to themselves for no reason other than to convey plot-points to the audience), but overall I was a very happy reader.	2004-06-22
US	50631983	R1827RZQP0EB8Z	0151768358	458314472	Rendezvous With Rama	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Same ingredients as CHILDHOOD'S END, but better result	RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA showcases a lot of things that must fascinate Arthur C. Clarke, or at least a lot of concepts that he likes revisiting in his fiction.  Once again, we have mankind's first contact with extraterrestrials, human colonies on the moon and on other solar planets, academic and political in-fighting, and, of course, a healthy dose of science.  But the ingredients do well together here.  This is, as you surely already know, one of the so-called classic science fiction novels, yet I only just got around to reading it recently.  I'm happy to say that it matched my expectations, both compared to other Clarke novels and to its own lofty reputation.<br />An unknown object has entered Earth's solar system in the year 2130, and a rocket ship is dispatched to study this alien artifact (dubbed Rama) and report back on its findings.  That sentence is a summary of almost the entire plot.  But RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA is not a story that is wholly concerned with plot.  It's more a series of set pieces: the decision to explore, the examination of the immediate inside, the voyage across the interior's sea, etc.  Each one is interesting on its own, but not all of them contribute much to the overall story. <br />The purpose these set pieces serve is to invoke a sense of wonder at this unknowable alien object.  I'm reminded of Jules Verne's voyage-type stories, where his protagonist(s) would become engaged in a multitude of individual adventures.  But instead of exploring (and inventing) Earth's wonders, Clarke is showing us a completely fictional environment.  It's quite fun.  Clarke put most of his effort into creating this landscape, and it becomes the focus and centerpiece of the whole novel.  This entire endeavor would flop completely if Clarke had been unable to sustain the suspense for the full length of the novel.  But he does it.  <br />Character development is not one of this book's priorities.  Too much time is spent developing the setting to provide us with people of any great depth.  Clarke gets away with it here (while other science fiction novels have crashed and burned on this point) because he has set the book up as a mystery, with the setting as its question.  Squandering time on the human characters would merely be a distraction, when all the reader is really interested in is Rama itself.<br />RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA is now over thirty years old, but this science fiction novel isn't showing its age (although some of the aside mentions of polygamous relationships are attempting to sound modern and forward-thinking, yet instead end up seeming rather quaint).  I've heard mixed things about the sequels which follow on from the end of this book.  Given how much I enjoyed the first in the series, I think I'll probably at least try one or two of them.  Maybe I won't like them as much as I did RENDEZVOUS, but that's a high standard to reach.	2004-06-13

He was certainly the most prolific.  He also wrote numerous non-fiction tomes, the subjects ranging over everything from an annotated guide to the Holy Bible to introductory chemistry and physics texts.  But, so the introduction claims, this is the only book that is a combination of the two -- a series of essays wherein Asimov discusses science fiction itself: its authors, its history and its flavor.  Asimov is rather strict in his definitions and rigid in his opinions, but I didn't find this a hindrance.  On the contrary, even the passages I disagreed with made me think further about my own positions and opinions.  The mark of a good persuasive essay is not that it necessarily persuades, but that it provokes thought.  <br />ASIMOV ON SCIENCE FICTION is three hundred eighteen pages long, made up of fifty-five essays which are categorized into eight sections.  These subjects are: science fiction in general, the writing of science fiction, the predictions of science fiction, the history of science fiction, science fiction writers, science fiction fans, science fiction reviews, and science fiction and I (Asimov).  These essays are primarily reprints from previously published material.  The majority of them are editorials from his eponymously titled science fiction magazine, while the rest are taken from introductions to various collections or magazine articles or previously unpublished essays.  There's a slight bit of repetition at times since there's a fair amount of overlap in the scope of these individual essays.  But for the most part this is a nicely broad look at different aspects of science fiction.<br />The book is as intelligent as one would expect from this author.  Asimov doesn't limit himself to speaking only on science fiction.  Rather, he compares the genre and its history to changes in society and mainstream literature.  In lighter moments, he also has some good-humored fun at the expenseof both himself and his fellow writers.  Virtually everything he says about the genre itself is reflected in his actual fiction.  Not surprisingly to anyone familiar with his work, he is very much in favor of emphasizing the 'science' in 'science fiction'.  While I may find this approach occasionally limiting as a reader, his argument does make for interesting reading.<br />The best thing I can say about this book is that it gave me a huge list of classic science fiction novels and authors that I need to check out soon.  (I weep at the thought of the free time I will have to acquire if I'm going to get all this new reading done.)  Asimov has an obvious love for the genre and he's familiar with virtually everything about it.  And there are a few genuine surprises within these pages -- to whit, his critical drubbing of George Orwell's 1984 or his analysis of the science fiction that was coming out of the Soviet Union.<br />Asimov always had interesting things to say.  I remember seeing him in a documentary made by a New Jersey PBS station about the television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.  Asimov, at a local convention, is discussing science fiction in general and angrily decrying those who would dismiss the genre as mere child's stuff.  &quot;Anything can be just kid's stuff if it's read by people with the mentality of children.&quot;  His finger is dramatically stabbing the air.  &quot;I invite those people to actually read it themselves.  Assuming, of course, that they know how to read.&quot;  At this point the trajectory of his finger reaches its apex.  &quot;Which is not always a foregone conclusion!&quot;  That clip basically sums up this book.  Opinionated, forceful, amusing and deeply loyal to his genre of choice.	2004-06-11
US	50631983	R3MUCEGAA0H6QD	0426205049	159935524	The Dying Days (Doctor Who : The New Adventures)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	House of Mars	THE DYING DAYS: eagerly anticipated before its release; desperately searched for as a rarity since then.  How does it stand up today?  This is the third time that I've read this novel, and to be honest it's lost a little something for me on each reread.  Which isn't as bad as it seems, since I thought it was absolutely brilliant the first time.  <br />I've seen this novel hailed as a penetratingly thoughtful meta-textual discussion on Doctor Who, both as it existed on TV, as it continued in the Virgin novels, and then as the book license was snatched away back to the BBC.  I'm wondering if I missed something somewhere.  Yes, I saw the jokes, but I didn't think of them as anything more than a handful of throwaway jokes.  Though as jokes go, these are quite good.  Hilarious, in fact.  I don't think Parkin gets enough credit for his humor, to be honest.  I've laughed much more at some of his witty sentences than from whole pages of some \\"comedy\\" Doctor Who writers.<br />However, one of the jokey things I felt backfired somewhat was Parkin's clever trick of only having three invading Ice Warriors ever seen in any one given scene.  Apparently this was a response to a statement made by Philip Segal (producer of the Paul McGann Doctor Who TV-movie) saying that they couldn't have had the plot of the film include an alien invasion because creating hundreds of prosthetic costumes would have been too expensive.  Parkin wanted to prove that assertion false by writing an action-packed adventure where, in long-standing Doctor Who tradition, we only see three or four costumed actors at a time.  (Apologies to either of the two gentlemen if I'm paraphrasing them inaccurately.)  He sort of gets away with it, yet I felt he was placing too much of a limitation on himself, with no clear benefit other than successfully winning an argument.  The supposedly huge invasion of Earth just doesn't feel in any way epic.  He proved that this sort of thing can be done, but, in a novel, should it?<br />The characters are a lot of fun, if not terribly deep (partially a reflection of the novel as a whole).  The most interesting thing about the story is not the alien invasion (done a thousand times before), but the takeover of the British government by rogue forces working from within.  Parkin's well-known shtick of having Ian Richardson \\"playing\\" a character in his novels leads to inevitable (and very welcome) comparisons to HOUSE OF CARDS, the mini-series in which Ian Richardson's character backstabs, lies and cheats his way into 10 Downing Street.  Here in THE DYING DAYS, a character not totally dissimilar in description to Ian Richardson, backstabs, lies and cheats his way into 10 Downing Street with the help of some invading Ice Warriors.  A fun spin to put on both the otherwise tired invasion plot and the political intrigue plot.<br />The other characters seem a bit shallow in comparison (I wonder how much of Greyhaven's superb characterization was due to me having seen HOUSE OF CARDS, and simply overlaying some of that character onto this one), and there's an unfortunate instance of the clichéd \\"underling who stays loyal to his higher masters\\" bit.  That said, the Doctor Who regulars themselves are great.  Benny has never been better, and Parkin sets a high standard for writing the Eighth Doctor that has rarely been matched.  And while Paul Cornell is the novel author who seems the fondest of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, Parkin's ability to give the old soldier dignity, great lines and serious gravitas blows many of Cornell's attempts out of the water.<br />All right, perhaps I've been a bit hard on the book in this review up until now.  So at this point I'm going to really turn on the praise.  What a fun, rollicking, entertaining romp this is!  It's exciting, and filled with thrills and spills.  And coming from the pen of Lance Parkin (or keyboard or quill, or whatever it is he uses to write), it maintains his high quality of prose.  The actually writing itself is very good.  Little thoughts and tidbits are scattered throughout, making the book never dull.  The NAs had a reputation of attempting to go a bit deeper than the series went, and since this was the first bona fide \\"alien invasion of contemporary Earth\\" story that the series did, Parkin goes in a little more for describing how exactly the population and the world would reaction to a literal invasion of Britain.  The results are entertaining, exhilarating and often amusing.  Oh, and the pacing is so gripping that I couldn't imagine even someone who disliked the book finding it boring.<br />Lance Parkin is, of course, also writing the (forthcoming) final EDA, which is oddly appropriate given that he wrote the final Doctor-led New Adventure, which was also the first original Eighth Doctor novel.  I'm expecting very different things.  While he presumably will be subtly tying up some of the continuing EDA plot-strands, here the only thing he had to do was move Benny from point A to point B, so that she continue as leading lady of the New Adventures.  Whether having fewer or greater numbers of restrictions/demands will affect the quality remains to be seen.  THE DYING DAYS perhaps lacks the drive of Parkin's previous NA, JUST WAR, but I can forgive, given that it's not trying to be an intensely emotional drama but rather a rompy action-adventure.  Like the New Adventures themselves, it may have had a few rough spots, but overall it's a good ride.  It's books like THE DYING DAYS that serve to remind me of how much I miss this novel series.	2004-06-01
US	50631983	R38AYJJH1BNJPX	1903889081	871335116	Ghost Ship (Doctor Who)	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	I ain't afraid of no ghosts	Going into GHOST SHIP, I had rather low expectations.  I'd read a lot of reviews slagging off everything from the plot to the characterization of the Fourth Doctor.  Its ranking on Shannon Patrick Sullivan's charts placed it near the very bottom, and, although I had never read anything from this author before, Keith Topping's reputation for fiction writing isn't exactly stellar.  To my utter shock and amazement, I really enjoyed it anyway.<br />By far, the most ubiquitous criticism is that it's told in first-person narration from the point of view of the Fourth Doctor.  And yet, at first glance, the character appears to be totally unlike any performance we'd ever seen Tom Baker give.  He's nervous, unsure of himself, panicky, and awkward.  At one point, he even runs off back to the TARDIS hell-bent on making a quick getaway.  For the first ten or twenty pages, I didn't believe it in the slightest.<br />But further on from that, I began thinking.  The book is set in the void between THE DEADLY ASSASSIN and THE FACE OF EVIL, where the Doctor spent some unknown amount of time wandering through space and time alone.  Is it possible that his already dark character could have dipped deeper?  I began pondering some other moments that we had already seen of the Fourth Doctor's life.  The graying, brooding figure we saw in his final season (particularly in LOGOPOLIS).  The almost callous man who Sarah admonishes in PYRAMIDS OF DEATH for not seeming human.  Yes, I decided.  Yes, I could buy this as a continuation of the character, pushed a tad bit farther than we'd seen before, and without the usual humor that balanced out this part of him.  It made me think and reflect on a character whose main source of development ended decades ago, which isn't a simple trick.<br />Though to be fair to critics of this characterization, what I couldn't buy was the actual language that he used.  First of all, it's difficult to imagine the Fourth Doctor actually sitting down to write something like his memoirs without getting fed up and wanting to save the universe or pop in on Da Vinci or something.  But going further, I just can't see his prose being this flowery or this filled with clever similes and metaphors.  Don't get me wrong; it's good, it just doesn't seem like the sort of thing that he would say.<br />As for the rest of the novella, well, it's basically a ghost story (no big shocker, given the title), and as a ghost story it relies almost exclusively on the author's ability to evoke an appropriately creepy tone.  Of other reviews, I've noticed that those who loathed the book didn't see any plausible atmosphere created, while those that liked the book did see that.  Place me in the second column then.  I found the book quite chilling.<br />The plot is secondary to establishing the mood.  We meet characters and see their conversations, more for the sake of developing them and their role in the ambiance than for any particular plot reasons.  This can appear either as necessary scene setting or mindless padding, depending on your point of view.  By the time we meet the bulk of the secondary characters, I was already absorbed in the flow of the story and accepted this in the manner in which I assume it was intended.<br />GHOST SHIP has too much going against it to be really popular.  If you don't like the characterization of the Fourth Doctor, you'll hate the book.  If you don't like the atmosphere Topping attempts to create, you'll hate the book.  Personally, I thought it was very good indeed, but I realize I'm never going to be in the majority on this.  I'd recommend giving it a try though, even if you do end up detesting it.  It's short and it's well paced, so you won't be wasting too much time; I read it in one quick sitting and enjoyed it enormously.	2004-05-31
US	50631983	R1PQ5A1NS11H0Y	0812550706	401439625	Ender's Game (The Ender Quintet)	Books	3	25	37	N	N	Stuck in the middle with you	I really enjoyed reading ENDER'S GAME, although I certainly had a few qualms along the way.  I found it to be an entertaining, engrossing read that had me quickly flipping through the pages, eager to see what came next.  But, to be honest, I'm a bit baffled by the overwhelming praise directed towards this book.  Sure, it's good, but I didn't find it nearly as powerful as others have.  <br />Plot is the most important part of this book, coming at the expensive of style.  The prose is mostly workmanlike, though it's deceptively good at slowly ratcheting up the tension.  Characters are virtually nothing more than ciphers for the storyline, and while they're distinctive, they're rarely given much depth.  Ironically, I felt the only character that approached full-development was Ender's sister, Valentine, and she is really only defined by her relations with her two brothers.<br />One thing I should mention is that I absolutely hated the ending of this book.  Hated, hated, hated it.  It took the suspension of disbelief that I'd been managing to hold onto for three hundred pages and just threw that out the window.  I can accept that selectively bred children can be perfectly reasoning geniuses.  I can even accept that they can talk in perfectly formed little speeches to each other (though this is a bit harder to digest, to be honest).  But I simply cannot believe that any organization (I'm being deliberately vague in order to avoid spoilers) would allow that certain decision to be made by a character of that age.  It's laughable.  Ridiculous.  And unfortunately, coming at the end as it did, it put a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  Not enough to ruin the previous chapters, mind you, but enough to turn me just a little bit away.  I can take (and often enjoy) fictions that are overly cynical, but this seemed to be cynical just for the sake of being cynical, i.e. very contrived.  It felt exploitative and manipulative.  Given that the main themes of the book are exploitation and manipulation, this may very well have been deliberate, and the reaction I felt was exactly what the author wanted me to feel.  But you can't expect me to like it.<br />Maybe the kudos that this book receives is because it's a fictional novel that asks and hints at a lot of heavy, deep philosophical questions.  Of course, humankind has been asking these same questions for a few thousand years now, and I'm not convinced that ENDER'S GAME is bringing anything particularly new to the table.  Truthfully, I enjoyed this book simply as a straightforward science-fiction action-adventure, nothing more.  The philosophizing and moral dilemmas were presented in a slightly too clumsy and obvious a manner for my tastes.  Clearly, mileage will vary on this point, as many, many others would evidentially appear to have got a lot more out of this than I did.<br />That said, I think the book's attempt to tell the story more or less completely from the point of view of an especially gifted child was a success.  On the other hand, the eventual reason for the main characters being so young does come across as a bit of cheat at the end, and one wonders if it wouldn't have been a tad more believable to make these mature-seeming people just a slight bit older in age too.  Still, it worked for me, so I can't complain too much.  When Ender must deal with bullies and other &quot;child&quot; problems, he is presented as more (adult) rational than (child) emotional (not what I would have expected), but ultimately he does come across well as an unusually composed youth.  The parts where I really felt disturbed by the cast's age was during the more bloody of the fight scenes; in particular, when two pre-pubescent boys stand naked in a bathroom kicking each other in the groin until one of them collapses.  I suppose the point was to make the reader uncomfortable, but I think it really could have been done better in a less distasteful way.<br />My copy of the book (a paperback of the 1991 reissue)contains an overly defensive introduction from Orson Scott Card wherein he attacks opponents of his book for being too insecure and unable to empathize with gifted, intelligent children.  He seems to be of the mind that people either loved his book unconditionally or loathed it utterly, with no room for opinions in the middle.  Looking around at the other reviews, he may very well be right.  But I find myself in a rare position.  I abhorred some portions of this book, but really enjoyed others.  Overall, it more than maintained my interest and kept me speeding through, and I'll give it a lot of credit for that.  I didn't fall in love with the novel, but I enjoyed it enough that I'll probably get around to the sequels eventually.<br />(Oh, and I was amused to note that Card seems to have correctly predicted the rise of the Internet-based political blogs, although he does get confused as to whether he wants his would-be power-grabbers to be merely influencing memes or controlling people and events directly.  Of course, in his fictional universe, we're to believe that people take on-line political scribblings a lot more seriously than they do in ours.)	2004-05-19
US	50631983	R1MI604BVBHAB7	0426205022	609003894	Lungbarrow (Doctor Who: The New Adventures)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Doctor who?	This is the third time I've read LUNGBARROW, and I think it's the first time that I've actually understood most of it.  Yes, this is one of the most complicated, detailed and multi-layered books that the New Adventures produced, but ultimately one of the most rewarding.  The more one thinks about it, the more there is to appreciate.  It's remembered now mostly for the sections set during the Old Time on the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey and for the return of the Doctor to his ancestral seat, the House of Lungbarrow in the Southern Mountains of Gallifrey (after a mere six hundred seventy-three year absence).  Platt continues on with the story that began life in the so-called Cartmel Masterplan and which was further fleshed out in Platt's own TIME'S CRUCIBLE.  But LUNGBARROW is far superior to that previous NA.  On a second (or third or fourth) reading, we already know what the great &quot;revelations&quot; will be, so we can focus more on how we arrive at them.  And that's the most interesting part of this journey.  <br />First, as for answering all of the questions about Who the Doctor is...  In that respect, all the important speeches go to Leela, who simply argues that the Doctor is a mystery, full stop.  Of course, the novel itself does go a little farther than that.  We see some critical moments in the Doctor's life before he initially left Gallifrey.  But the details are sketchy.  Some things we see, other things are left to our imagination.  The audience is constantly kept a layer away from the action.  The most important questions are merely suggested, and not answered.  Why does the Doctor do this?  Why does he pick one course of action and not another?  What is his motivation?  We never get anything like a full picture, which leaves the Doctor with a few secrets still intact.  The book sits comfortably, balancing between tying up some loose ends from the past, while offering some hints about what will be coming up in the Doctor's future (namely the PaulMcGann movie which had aired about a year before the publication of this novel and contained revelations of its own).  To be honest, on paper, I'm not thrilled about some of the answers Platt provides (&quot;Grandfather indeed!  I've never seen you before in my life!&quot;  Ttpppth!).  But I can't fault the book for its imagination or its scope.  It's to the book's credit that the things that should have annoyed the daylights out of me didn't really bother me much at all.<br />And now that I've addressed the point that most discussion concerning this book revolves around I'm going to move on to more interesting topics.  Don't get me wrong; the tantalizing &quot;secrets&quot; about the Doctor, the Other and their history are all very interesting, but what I take from this book is mostly its range of storytelling, its superb setting, and its memorable characters.  The Doctor's cousins are fascinating.  Most Time Lords have forty-four cousins, but we only really encounter six of them, which makes the book much easier to follow than it would have been otherwise.  <br />In fact, I'm having difficulty separating the characters from their setting in my mind.  I cannot imagine the House of Lungbarrow without the cousins, and the cousins themselves simply wouldn't work without the overarching support of the House.  I'm not quite sure whether to describe the House as another character, or the characters as parts of the House.  I suppose I'll have to be boring at this junction and just say that it's a bit of both.  Certainly they play off each other; the stranger the cousins appear, the more sinister the house becomes.<br />Platt's characterization is a gift.  Not only for his own creations, but also for the established characters that he's writing for.  His Leela is deadly accurate, taking what was a fairly hokey idea (Leela choosing to stay behind with Bland Character #3) and actually exploring it in an interesting way.  At times, the number of previous characters he's writing for can feel as though it's about to get out of hand.  But Platt manages the Doctor, Chris, Ace/ Dorothee, Romana, Andred and two K9s (plus a few Special Guest Villains) in style, although poor Chris spends his last story as a regular having someone else's dreams and flashbacks.  No one new to Doctor Who would be able to make heads or tails out of any of this, but then no one new to Doctor Who has any business starting here.<br />I get the feeling that world-building is something that Platt enjoys doing in his fiction.  He's certainly very good at it.  The passages involving the workings of the Houses, the Looms, the Gallifreyan rituals, and so on are completely engrossing.  Although he's populating Gallifrey with different item, he's using a similar method to the great Robert Holmes, who had an uncanny ability to build up an entire universe by tossing out a few details, painting in some specifics while leaving others to the imagination.  It's a rare talent -- one that has served both of these writers well.  Platt's prose drew me in utterly, driving up the tension with each passing page, while juggling several items at once while building a fascinating world, and intriguing people.  <br />For me, a good rule of thumb is that if I needed a long time to finish a novel, then it generally means that I was bored or I plain loathed it.  But I took my time with this reading of LUNGBARROW, happy to drink in the atmosphere and deliberate over the details.  I didn't feel a need to read quickly, because I was in no hurry to finish.  I knew what questions would be asked, I knew what answers would be offered.  I had much more fun stopping to smell the roses.  Good-bye, Seventh Doctor; you'll be missed.	2004-05-18
US	50631983	R3TJ66A0QQH4KC	0805317554	401693623	Fundamentals of Database Systems (3rd Edition)	Books	4	61	66	N	N	Fundamental, though not overly friendly	I used FUNDAMENTALS OF DATABASE SYSTEMS (Third Edition) in a graduate class I took on databases, and I've kept referring to the book since then.  As a student, I'll admit that it was tough to get through this book at times.  It's dense and almost impenetrable, but it packs a huge amount of information and is amazingly comprehensive.<br />It puts theory well ahead of practical matters, which gives the novice a good foundation from which to really get a firm handle on how all these pieces fit together.  The assumption is that the student knows nothing, even B-trees are devoted several pages of explanation.  The student who does know nothing will doubtless find this wealth of data to be overwhelming at first (as I did).  But stick at it.  This textbook is not for people looking at how to simply plug things into Microsoft Access.  It's for programmers seriously looking to gain a strong background in what the fundamental elements of database components and systems are.<br />The text starts off simply, merely explaining in general terms what databases are and who will use them.  Then we quickly move into modeling how relational databases work.  Data Modeling and Entity-Relationship Models are described in-depth, and the book comes back to ER modeling and mapping repeatedly.  Object Models are covered, as well as the best ways of sorting records and the best way to index tables.  The authors offer a wealth of information concerning the SQL language -- so much so, that there's much that I simply haven't used since reading about it, although I'm sure that more advanced database programmers in the audience will find it very enlightening.<br />It continues on with Object-Oriented Database technologies, functional dependencies, and normal forms (first, second, third and Boyce-Codd normal form).  Higher system views of database architecture are also discussed, giving us an understanding of how different parts are working together. Optimization, recovery, maintenance and securityare naturally touched on, as are distributed databases and the basic client/server architecture relationship.  As you can see, this is all very theoretical, although some real-life explanations and examples are brought in.  But it is by building up a solid knowledge base that will allow the reader to truly understand systems when encountered in the classroom or in the workplace.<br />I've only touched on a handful of things that the book details in its 1000+ pages.  It's packed with mathematical formulas, computer science algorithms, schema design, and the minutua of every database operation.  Its approach doesn't make things easy, but it does contain everything you'd want to know about a given item.  I had to read various sections multiple times for my coursework, obviously, but every time I studied a passage, I would uncover details and concepts that I had missed the last time. Even now as reference material, I always find myself learning (or relearning) something when consulting this book. <br />Although in my current job I don't require a massive amount of database knowledge, I still find this an extremely useful reference guide.  To be perfectly honest, I don't know if I would find this text helpful if I hadn't taken a course that taught from it.  It's certainly intimidating to a beginner.  But if you're a moderate to intermediate database programmer, you'll find this an invaluable guide to filling in the gaps in your knowledge.  It may be a bit too dense and scary to serve as your only teacher, but you'll probably find it an important one.	2004-05-05
US	50631983	ROS73REN4X69Q	0426205006	375643189	The Room With No Doors (Doctor Who: The New Adventures)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	The Ronin With No Sword	THE ROOM WITH NO DOORS is thankfully weightier than Kate Orman's previous solo outing, and is so much the stronger for it.  ROOM is an atmospheric, thoughtful and enjoyable story which has only improved with age.<br />The story is set in Sixteenth Century Japan, where enigmatic samurai stalk the land on horseback, and feudal lords dream of defeating their rivals.  Into this fascinating setting has landed a strange chunk of science fiction -- an alien pod with mysterious powers of healing and restoration.  Naturally, this causes all kinds of chaos, and it turns out that the Doctor and Cwej aren't the only time travelers visiting this location.<br />The alien pod is, of course, mostly a big McGuffin, designed to give the local warlords something to scheme and stage huge battles over.  Frankly, I preferred the pod when we weren't getting its scientific explanations and it was merely an excuse to make the plot move in a given direction.  In fact, my favorite parts of the novel were the ones devoid of any science fiction elements at all (in other words, the sword-fights and archery were more interesting than the laser blasts), leading me to believe that I would have enjoyed the book even more if it had been done as a pure historical.  It would certainly have knocked the spots off of SANCTUARY, the previous Doctor Who story with no sci-fi elements.  For instance, take the opening sections of the book concerning the three samurai (two warriors, one of whom brings his son along to learn the ropes) on a mission, who stylishly go about their business being all cool and samurai-y.  If the whole novel had been done in that manner, I would have absolutely adored it.<br />Not that I disliked the rest of the book.  On the contrary, there's a lot to enjoy here.  The Seventh Doctor's life is drawing to a close, his regeneration having aired on TV screens the previous year and his book series concluding in a matter of months.  He can feel Paul McGann's wig approaching, and he worriesabout the unfinished business in his current life.  Tying up some loose ends from this incarnation is handled quite well here.  We see the Doctor's troubles reflected in his own meditations and in his relationships with the book's secondary characters.<br />Chris Cwej is also given a lot to fret over, finally coming to terms with the events of the previous few books.  I wasn't reading these last few NAs in order the last time around; I ended up not having a complete collection, and read the ones I did have in a fairly random order.  Now that I have finally read them all in the order they were meant to be experienced, I'm quite impressed with what they did with Chris during the end of the series.<br />The comic relief in this book comes in the form of the alien Kapteynians who are described as being giant space chickens.  I found this funnier than I did the last time I read the novel, mostly because this time I was reading it while the Subservient Chicken was entering minute seven of its fifteen minutes of fame.  I dare you to take one look at subservientchicken.com and tell me that the guy in the cheap chicken costume isn't exactly what the BBC would have produced had this been a television adventure.<br />As with many of Orman's novels, the secondary characters are delightfully memorable.  Penelope, the time-traveling Victorian woman, comes across as a solid creation, interesting, but not overpowering.  I think the temptation might have been to give her more of the spotlight, but she works a lot better as a one-woman Greek chorus, occasionally chiming in on the perils and ethics of time travel.  The Zen monks are fun -- grinning a lot and saying counter-intuitive things, just as we expect them to.  Kame, the ronin, is also a major source of entertainment.  I wish he could have been brought along at the end of this adventure.<br />The only character who didn't quite work for me was Joel, and that's mostly because he was also in Orman's RETURN OF THE LIVING DAD.  Not that there was anything wrong with him there.  The problem I had was that he's supposed to be significant older in this book than he was then, yet I had to continually remind myself that he is no longer a kid.  I could stomach the teenage angst'n'fanboy stuff when he actually was a teenager; it made sense in that context.  But it seemed odd to see the exact same stuff coming out of a person who is now supposed to be older than Chris (thirteen years have passed from Joel's subjective point of view since RETURN, while Chris has only seen a couple of years go by).  Maybe there was something about this character that I just didn't get.<br />I've seen a few posts in various on-line forums where the author claims that &quot;very little about ROOM was deliberate&quot;.  I certainly couldn't tell that from reading it.  In fact, it came across to me as the opposite; it felt very deliberate and focused.  The themes of isolation, punishment (self-inflicted as well as from outside sources) and redemption permeate throughout the whole book, and are revisited in a variety of ways.  I enjoyed this book the first time I read it.  I appreciated it much more this second time.  And I fully expect that the third time I read it, my enjoyment will increase again.	2004-05-04

Hello, my name is Tom Arden,<BR>And I'm a big goofball.<BR>I'm not harmin' like Kate Orman,<BR>No, I am mad like Mad Magrs is.<br />NIGHTDREAMERS is what you'd get if you went back in time and handed William Shakespeare an elementary Physics textbook, a kiddie version of the Grimm's Fairy Tales, and a crack-pipe.  This book is as goofy as all get out.  I liked it, but it's possible that you would have to be in the mood to read something as wacky as this.  It's a very fine line between outrageous fun and tedious illogic, and I can definitely see how others could hate this.  Personally, this was just what I was in the mood for, so it worked for me.  Every time I turned a page, I'd think, &quot;Well, the story can't possible get any goofier&quot; only to be proved wrong yet again.  Maybe if I read it a second time in a different frame of mind, I wouldn't have the same reaction.  But at least I would know what I was in for.<br />The story has a very fairy tale feel to it.  It's about royal families and magical demons.  The prose has a childlike quality.  Yet, despite these characteristics, it doesn't quite succeed at being a fairy tale, as there simply isn't enough death, destruction and random violence.  Traditional fairy tales are much darker, much more grisly than this.  This is like a Disney-extreme version, resulting in something that lacks the edge of its basis.  It seems to be written at a young child's level, but I'm not sure that kids wouldn't feel they were being talked down to.  I imagine this is an attempt at being a nostalgia version of a fairy tale -- the pleasant, happy stuff, from an adult point of view where all the darker elements have been forgotten.<br />Still, if the book isn't a successful fairy-tale, I did find it hugely entertaining.  Maybe it was just the mood I was in, but I was laughing like someone who needs locking up.  The third Doctor is, of course, the perfect foil to the bizarre unnatural behavior going on around him.  Monsters are roaming the woods, princesses need rescuing, and the Doctor is wandering around mumbling about his sonic screwdrivers and his physics.  It's a hoot!  This sort of thing would be unbelievably awful if expanded out to novel length, but it's much easier to keep up this spoof insanity for the mere one hundred and five pages that this story lasts.<br />Ultimately, I really enjoyed NIGHTDREAMERS as a celebration of style over substance.  In other words, it's got a lot of goofy style, but absolutely no substance at all.  I laughed a lot, though to be perfectly honest, I don't know whether I was laughing with it or at it.  Was I was meant to be amused by some of the action adventure clichés or was I somehow expected to take this nonsense seriously?  There's absolutely nothing original about anything here, the only question is whether these particular stock pieces have been ripped off exactly this sort of way before.  I can't fathom what the author was attempting, but the result just entertained me.  Judging by Katy Manning's foreword (where she talks about losing her house keys, visiting her mother, being evicted from her apartment, and, oh yes, says a few words at the end about the book), she didn't quite know what to make of it either.  And, paradoxically, despite the fact that I can't think of a single story like this one, this is probably the most faithful print recreation of the Third Doctor era that I can think of.  Go figure.	2004-05-03

In a few short months, the patterns I have learned from this book have become invaluable.  I've already started going back through my legacy code looking for badly designed structures and have gradually been upgrading my work.  If only I had known about this stuff years ago, I could have saved myself time, both during the creation of code and now, when I'm maintaining it.  <br />Software patterns are a way of preventing the programmer from reinventing the wheel.  Many of the patterns discussed in this book are refinements of procedures that have been tried and tested thousands of times over the years.  The idea is that by studying these prototypes, we can save ourselves time by standing on the shoulders of those noble computer scientists who came before us.  And it really works too.  Reading about these patterns instantly drove into my head all the places in the past where I should have been using an elegant pattern as described here, rather than the ramshackle, jury-rigged solution I created.  And I even learned more about the patterns that I was already familiar with.  Every Java programmer knows about, say, Iterator, but I found it fascinating to read about how powerful that little routine can be.<br />The book is divided into three main forms of patterns: creational patterns, structural patterns and behavioral patterns.  The patterns discussed span all portions of an object's life (the book is geared towards Object-Oriented Programming).  We learn the best way of creating objects, the best way to have them communicate with other objects, and the best way to have them running their own algorithms.  It really encourages the writing of clean code.  Decoupling objects is the order of the day, and while I already knew vaguely that this was a good idea, this book showed me why exactly this is desirable, and equally importantly, it showed me how best to implement it.<br />I was introduced to this book by enrolling in an excellent class, which walked us through the various patterns.  Given that the book has a tendency towards dryness, I would recommend this learning method to anyone.  The examples proposed on these pages are, perhaps, a little esoteric and can at times be obscure.  Because the book was written way back in the dark ages of 1994, the sample code is written in C++ and Smalltalk; we can assume that if this same book were written today, Java would reign supreme.  An instructor who has used these patterns in real applications should be able to provide the student with a plethora of easy-to-understand scenarios, to really drive home how and where these patterns should be implemented.<br />Again, don't let the relative age fool you; get this book and take a class that explains it.  If you can't find a class that teaches from this, then try to learn on your own.  The skills you'll pick up from this will be immensely rewarding.  Just be prepared to have the inevitable realization of: &quot;Oh, so that's what I should have been doing all this time!  Now where am I going to find the time to go back and fix it?&quot;	2004-05-02
US	50631983	R35B4LR7S4428K	0426204972	124253057	Eternity Weeps (Doctor Who: The New Adventures)	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	&quot;Kill the humans.  Kill the humans.  Kill the humans.&quot;	ETERNITY WEEPS was the book to end the short-lived marriage of Bernice Summerfield and Jason Kane.  As Benny was soon to be taking over the reigns as star of the NAs, the powers that be decided she would work better on her own, unencumbered by her dolt of a husband.  During the course of the novel, not only does Mortimore kill off the Summerfield-Kane marriage, but also most of the supporting cast, countless extras, dozens of unseen scientists, an entire alien civilization, and a large percentage of the Earth's population.  Yikes.  I imagine that if you were to ask Mortimore to mow your lawn for you while on vacation, you'd return home to find that he's accomplished this task by sending your sun supernova.<br />The story is told by alternating the narrative viewpoints; Jason narrates the even-numbered chapters, while Benny relates the events during the odd.  This is a neat trick, showing us the state of the marriage from both sides as it slowly disintegrates.  The story puts them on separate paths at the beginning, placing each one on a separate expedition to find the remains of Noah's Ark in the early part of the 21st Century.  <br />Naturally, the story gets more science-fictiony, but I quite liked the opening trek to find the Ark.  This is the sort of thing that the Benny-oriented books did well.  There's a lot of good atmosphere setting, character work and playful banter.  I enjoy this sort of mystery/voyage type story, and Mortimore does it very well.  It serves as a nice counterpoint to what comes later.<br />In general, killing off a sympathetic, well-defined secondary character is effective.  Killing off most of the supporting cast can be shocking.  When the death toll starts climbing into the millions, it's a little harder to grasp.  It's almost difficult to take the story seriously when the numbers get that high.  Still, the scenes of the alien virus sweeping through buildings, settlements, military bases and research facilities are genuinely creepy and frightening.  It's the success of these portions that allows the reader to vividly imagine how this catastrophe is taking place on a global scale.  Mortimore has killed off millions of people before (in his fiction, I hasten to clarify), but I think this is his most effective attempt.<br />Mortimore's fascination with DOCTOR WHO AND THE SILURIANS continues here.  He manages to tie up a few loose-ends from that story without being fanwanky or annoying, and he even updates one of the more memorable set pieces from that serial.<br />I liked ETERNITY WEEPS, although I couldn't shake the image of Jim Mortimore sitting in front of his work processor, dressed as Omega from &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;, pounding on his keyboard, shouting &quot;ALL THINGS!  ALL THINGS!  ALL THINGS MUST BE DESTROYED!&quot;  It's paced confidently and has a couple of good ideas at its core.  Just try not to get too attached to, well, anybody.	2004-05-01
US	50631983	R3TSA152FTZXDN	0670032603	993918563	A Call to Service: My Vision for a Better America	Books	4	18	26	N	N	"Ask not what your country can do for you..."	Before I even picked up this book, I knew from the onset that I wouldn't be voting for George W(MD) Bush this November.  I knew enough about the Republican to know that there was no way on Earth that he'd be earning my vote.  But I was curious about the other guy on the ballot.  Is he worth voting for?  Where does he stand on the issues?  Does he have a platform other than being \\"Anyone But Bush\\"?  I was a bit unsettled by some things in his record, such as his voting in favor of the Iraq War Disaster and the PATRIOT Act.  But after reading his version of where he stands on the issues, I feel much better about my choice in November.  There actually is a good guy on the ballot; thank goodness!<br />His book centers around two main elements: what kinds of things are going wrong in America today, and what direction he would like America to move in instead.  He, perhaps, doesn't spend as much time as he could on the first item, but remember that this is only a two-hundred page book, so obviously he doesn't have time to go into detail on every single one of Bush's multiple foul-ups.  It's his defense and detailing of his own basic ideals that is the core of the book. <br />The central theme here is an echo of that famous line of another JFK from Massachusetts: \\"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\\"  John Kerry has served his country in various capacities, and sees service (military, civilian, volunteer) as being the highest form of patriotism.  He praises Clinton's bolstering of AmeriCorps, and bemoans Bush's gutting of it.  He says we all need to have an interest in our nation's schools, universities, government, environment, military, police force, etc.  Ultimately, we all benefit when these institutions are functioning to their fullest potential.<br />I was impressed by his determination to end America's reliance on foreign (and most domestic) oil in a relatively short amount of time.  It wouldn't be a huge technological difficulty, of course, but it's great to see a politician who's actually in favor of advancing the science on this issue and not just praying that at some point in the future, oil will rain from the sky.  He lays out his position on this and other matters in a clear but specific manner.  I liked his writing style; it's clear, but not simplistic.  He understands that actions have consequences, and he doesn't shirk away from the good or the bad.<br />At various points during the book, he relates the policy he's discussing with his own personal experiences.  This is not unusual; all politicians will attempt this -- some more successfully than others.  I'd say that Kerry is one of the better ones.  He talks about recovering from prostate cancer, thinking about a) how fortunate he was and b) how he could possibly have afforded this excellent care if he had been one of the over 40 million people without health care coverage.  Unlike the current millionaire in the White House, I definitely got the impression that he genuinely cares about how most of the country lives and how day-to-day life can be a financial struggle even without the surprise extra costs of medical care.  His goals are clear, but commonsensical: no more uninsured children in America, and to give everyone the opportunity to join the same program that Federal Employees (like Congressmen) get.  Indeed, most of his ideas have a common-sense feel to them.  A lot of the solutions to today's crises are simple: the problem is that the guy currently in charge lacks the cajones to actually implement them.<br />He certainly seems to have a greater willingness to reach out to people on both sides of the Congressional aisle, as well as to people on both sides of the Atlantic.  During the book, he name-drops a few of the more popular kids in Congress (independent-minded Republican John McCain appears frequently) as an example of this.  I found this particularly interesting as I've been less and less happy with both of thenational political parties, and have instead been interested in those individual members who actually try to get things done.  It would be fascinating to see what would happen if we got a genuine uniter in the White House.<br />I did have to chuckle at a few of the book's more clumsy attempts at appealing to various \\"swing\\" groups.  What percentage of the audience will really be swayed by Kerry's interested in NASCAR?  <br />Oh, and given the similarity between the narrative voice and Kerry's own verbal style, I could actually believe that he wrote the book himself.  That must be something of a rarity for this style of political campaign book!  I'd recommend this to everyone who plans to vote in November as a good starter for where Kerry's position is.  Obviously, this is slanted and biased in favor of its author, but I found it to be a great place to start researching the issues.  <br />In this world of 24-hour news channels that focus upon smaller and smaller sound-bites (Shouldn't it be the opposite?  You'd think with more time than the evening news, they'd have room to focus on details and issues, except the opposite seems to be true.), it's nice to have the opportunity of a leisurely look through a series of important issues.  I don't know who will end up winning the election this fall, but the topics discussed in A CALL TO SERVICE certainly deserve to enter the national debate.	2004-04-20
US	50631983	R3EL3CNQWITA95	0375414010	240704700	Imperial America: The Bush Assault on the World Order	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Where did it all go wrong?	Given the title of this book (IMPERIAL AMERICA: THE BUSH ASSAULT ON THE WORLD ORDER) one might be forgiven for assuming that this is a standard left-wing screed laying all the evils of the world at the feet of George W(MD) Bush.  However, in this case, the cover isn't a great indicator of what lies beneath.  There's blame for the Bush Administration aplenty, but the information is covered in a calm, rational narrative voice, and the author (John Newhouse, senior fellow at the Center for Defense Information) is more interested in detail than in rhetoric. <br />Newhouse's basic premise is that Bush failed in the aftermath of 9/11/01.  After the terrorist attack, the outpouring of support given to America was without precedent.  A French newspaper proclaimed, \\"We are all Americans.\\"  A moment of silence for the victims was held at an Iranian soccer match.  But instead of seizing upon this moment to, for example, push for significant reform in Iran or demanding that Russia pay more attention to its dangerously unguarded stockpiles of nuclear weapons, the Bush Administration let these opportunities slip away.<br />Newhouse spends time focusing on one specific area of the world at a time.  He describes many of the local problems, and details how those conflicts affect America and American interests.  He then describes what position the Bush Administration found itself in, and then he offers possible solutions or diplomatic routes that the Administration could have followed.  He compares these possible directions to where Bush actually went, and in most cases it's: \\"Bush decided to ignore the problem and instead focused on Iraq\\" (but we knew that already).  Newhouse carefully shows how the absurd attention given to Saddam Hussein's (strangely absent) Weapons of Mass Destruction has actually weakened the global fight against terrorist extremists.  It's interesting to note that this book came out well before Richard Clarke's testimony before the 9/11 committee, yet containsa lot of echoes and concerns about an Administration focusing exactly on the wrong areas.<br />IMPERIAL AMERICA doesn't cover a lot of new ground; a lot of what is contained here has already been reported on in the press (though much of it has been buried underneath the latest Michael Jackson scandal, or whatever your media of choice has decided to waste time reporting).  However, Newhouse conducted many interviews with government officials, so there is a little bit of insider information scattered here and there.  My favorite tidbit of gossip was the official who likened a pre-9/11 Donald Rumsfeld to a cranky old man sending annoying, whining internal memos that interested no one. <br />I was frankly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.  Again, I was expecting something more along the lines of a Michael Moore-like screed, but what I got was a thoughtful, detailed and well-researched document.  It certainly educated me to a lot of what is going on in the world outside of the Hot Spot Of The Week, and has given me a great start into more reading on these subjects.  Recommend for anyone looking for a detailed, reasonable critique of the current Administration's rather glaring missteps.	2004-04-18
US	50631983	R3U0C8X1KNUKKB	0426204840	878107707	So Vile a Sin (Doctor Who : The New Adventures)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A story too broad and too deep for Ben's hard drive	Everyone reading this review doubtless already knows the story of how two names came to be on the spine of SO VILE A SIN.  I have nothing to add to the tale other than to relate that I always picture Kate Orman coming to the rescue as a Doctor Who version of Harvey Keitel as the tuxedoed Winston Wolf in PULP FICTION.  (&quot;You're sending the Orman?  Rebecca, mother-editor, that's all you needed to say!&quot;)<br />Vastly different images come to mind when I think about the past works of Aaronovitch and Orman.  Saying &quot;Kate Orman novel&quot; to me conjures up thoughts of many heartbreakingly touching character moments strung together in a tight plot.  &quot;Ben Aaronovitch novel&quot; makes me think of solar system-sized transit mechanics, solar system-sized civilizations, and armies dropping big things out of orbit onto the heads of other armies.  However, these caricatures of mine do both authors a disservice, as each has his or her particular strengths and weaknesses.  A fan of their previous individual work, I was extremely curious as to how their styles would mesh.  Although it's perhaps a little unfair of me to judge this as a true collaboration, given the circumstances behind the pairing.<br />The combination of their two distinct styles is very interesting.  Some of my favorite moments in Orman's novels have been when she concentrates on illustrating a single setting, such as the human colonies in SLEEPY and THE YEAR OF INTELLIGENT TIGERS.  Here, she does much the same thing, only instead of confining herself to one place, she has several of Ben's Really Big settings to populate.  The first hundred pages are spent warping from one gorgeous setting to the next.  Although these are great locations (and superbly brought to life) I kept wondering when the story was going to settle down and get started.  (My thought processes: &quot;Wow!  This is a great location; now the story will start here!  [A few dozen pages later.]  Wow!  This is another great location!  Now the story will start here!  [Even more pages later.]  Ooh, an even more interesting location... with robots and hardware!  Now the story will surely begin here!&quot;)  <br />The impression that this gave me was (and I am likely completely wrong in this evaluation, but it's how it felt to this reader) that it was a struggle to get all of these great individual pieces into the final manuscript.  More thought may have gone into determining how to flesh out each of these components with little time available to figure out how they fit together and whether they were all really needed in the first place.  It's not that all these things jar with each other, more than they just don't quite mesh smoothly.<br />I think the biggest problem is that there's just too much going on.  Indeed, I was surprised when I got to the end and realized that the Ormanovitch managed  to fit everything I had just read into a mere 312 pages.  We aren't given the chance to really dwell on anything, and this is a pity because there's a lot of great stuff going on.  This is why I find it difficult to be too critical of the content; it's the structure that doesn't seem to work.  The character of Vincenzi, to take an example, is given quite a bit of build-up, but then just seems to fade.  On the other hand, the galactic politicking is mentioned early, but so casually that the later power struggles seem to come out of nowhere.  Roz's death (no spoiler this -- it's mentioned on the first page) is indeed haunting, epic and powerful.  But while the sacrifice itself engages on the emotional level, the actual events leading up to it seem somewhat cold and detached.<br />Before I sign off, I should point out that despite the paragraphs I've spent complaining (I find it strangely easier to analyze flaws than to praise successes), I ultimately did enjoy reading this.  In addition to the aforementioned settings, the characters are fantastic.  I enjoyed seeing Roz interacting with her family, even iftheir motivations baffled me.  The plot, although wandering and disjointed, is ultimately satisfying.  The development of the book's alien races and the future history that builds upon what we saw in ORIGINAL SIN are also both a lot of fun.<br />Given the circumstances surrounding the publication of this novel, it's almost ludicrous to suggest &quot;oh, if only they'd had more time to iron out the problems&quot;, because, obviously time was not a luxury available.  But, oh, if only they'd had more time to iron out the problems.  Although it suffers from some flaws, I can't help but love a lot of the pieces that make up this novel.  At times it touches brilliance, which is exactly what we would expect from a book with those two names on the cover.	2004-04-13
US	50631983	RRSVNYU1Q1E5W	0743442539	682630645	The Spy Who Came In from the Cold	Books	4	95	103	N	N	Baby, it's cold outside	What is to be said about John Le Carré's THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD?  It's shockingly entertaining, it's genuinely unpredictable, and it doesn't offer up a cheap get-out-of-jail-free ending.  The characters are cursory without being shallow, the plot moves with amazing speed, and the action keeps bouncing along.  In short, this is pretty much the perfect spy novel.  As engrossing as it is realistic, and as absorbing as it is intriguing.<br />SPY is a book based almost entirely around its plot, and while I usually give a storyline summary in my reviews, I don't think I'll be doing that this time.  You see, the novel relies so much upon its double-crosses and back-stabbings that even the parts in the beginning (which are usually fair game for reviewers to spoil) can be puzzling and fun to follow.  Every part of the story is interesting.  Where other novels would still be setting up the premise, SPY has already started playing the game.<br />Apart from the deviously clever plot, there is one additional thing I want to single out for praise -- the relationship that takes place between two of the main characters.  On paper, it's a fairly standard idea: an older male spy paired with a younger, idealistic, innocent woman.  But in execution it's a very nicely unstated bit of romance.  It felt real, in part because Le Carré didn't beat us over the head with the details, merely sketched in the broader strokes and let the reader's imagination do the rest.<br />SPY isn't a story where the characters trade artificially witty banter in between their death-defying action sequences.  The protagonist spends most of the book tired, battered and confused.  It can be a mystery at times guessing whether he really knows what's going on, whether he is the chess-player or the pawn.  When one of the book's villains tries to engage him in a verbal battle over whose society and philosophy is the superior, he can only grumble and offer insults in reply.  It's this sort of likable realism that makes the book the success that it is.  At the time he wrote this, Le Carré had already joined and left Her Majesty's Secret Service, so I can't help but wonder if the plot, which seems intricate and elaborate in a fictional context, was actually a straightforward retelling of a standard spy-game.	2004-03-30
US	50631983	R3FA3Z5S5BYJSK	0426204832	761722208	Damaged Goods (Doctor Who: The New Adventures)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Damaged As Folk	Despite the continued release of massively restored old adventures onto DVD, over the course of the next twelve months DAMAGED GOODS will almost certainly be the Doctor Who story most revisited by fans.  The reason is obvious.  When author Russell T Davies wrote DAMAGED GOODS in 1996, he was simply a promising newcomer who had some relatively impressive television credits to his name.  Since then, his career has done nothing but rise.  He produced, created and wrote QUEER AS FOLK, TOUCHING EVIL, and THE SECOND COMING, was nominated for Sainthood, saved the humpbacked whale from extinction, caused the breakup of the Spice Girls, tricked a Martian invasion fleet to fly into the sun, and was named Producer of the still unseen Doctor Who TV revival.  For Doctor Who fans, the last of these accomplishments is naturally the most important.<br />I never got around to reading DAMAGED GOODS when it was first published; as with many of the books of this era (through no fault of their own) I found myself simply far too busy to get around to it.  I knew of its impressive reputation and was pleased when I eventually secured a copy.  So when I finally opened the cover I already knew that this Davies guy would be The Producer, The Writer And Main Pooh-Bah Of Doctor Who.  I found myself giving the book more scrutiny than I otherwise would have, simply to see if I could find clues as to what sort of series he will create based on what he had written here.  <br />Upon completion of the book, I realized that this approach is, of course, absolute nonsense.  What I didn't get out of the book was that the new series will feature two ex-cops as companions, or will take place in a London housing estate, or will feature big, evil monsters from Gallifrey's past.  What I did take away was the book's fabulous attention to detail, Davies' ability to create sympathetic, flawed, interesting characters, and his talent for pulling them all into an engaging plot that gives each person an important part to play.<br />Doctor Who on television almost always worked when it had interesting and believable characters.  Whether the characters were realistic was another matter entirely, and while the concepts sometimes dovetailed, this, I feel, was rare.  Sharaz Jek (to pick an example totally at random) is a fascinating creation whose obsessive behavior is believably conveyed.  But you couldn't imagine him at the far future's equivalent of a supermarket, because within the actual story of THE CAVES OF ANDROZANI it made more sense to have a collection of archetypes rather than someone you would expect to meet on the street (or in any place outside the confines of the story being told).  Davies manages to express both in his only Doctor Who novel (so far), which is a fantastic bonus as far as I'm concerned.  His characters are interesting, believable, and also realistic.  This formula certainly wouldn't be appropriate (or possible) for every Doctor Who story, but here it works, and thanks to Davies' skills, it works extremely well.  DAMAGED GOODS is fantasy grounded in realism, which can't be an easy thing to successfully pull off.<br />Getting to the book itself, one of the first wishes I have is that hopefully with the new series in production, Davies will find some spare time to write some more novels (or novelisations), because his prose is wonderful.  His sense of timing, his ability to effectively pace the story, and his sense of setting the proper atmosphere is superb.  A scene with a dead corpse returning to life is exactly the right amount of creepy and sinister.  It's nicely evocative of those Hinchcliffe-era horror stories without containing anything that feels like a retread or a copy.  Pieces of it reminded me at times of the psychological horror/thrillers that Stephen Gallagher wrote in his post-Doctor Who days.<br />Although the story is great from cover to cover, I found myself most enjoying the little things that the book did.  Little moments of humanityliberally scattered through the sections of pure horror... and, of course, the novel's themes.  In DAMAGED GOODS, the dead past never really leaves the living present.  Apart from the obvious zombie rising-from-the-dead parallels, there's a depressed middle-aged man who talks to the voice of his dead wife in his head, and secrets from character's pasts that never quite seem to go away.  Constant and subtle repetitions of the book's themes go a long ways towards making the book coherent and powerful.  The \\"damaged goods\\" of the title conveys a theme that is shockingly horrific.  The more I thought about the book's content, the more I appreciated it.  Revelations towards the end echo subject matter introduced earlier, making me gasp not only at the twist, but also at how deviously it subverted and built upon the seemingly innocuous prior passages.<br />So, what can we take from DAMAGED GOODS to look towards how the new Doctor Who series will turn out?  The subject matter, the number of continuity references, the balance of humor to drama?  No.  At the moment, we just can't make meaningful predictions without making them so general as to be worthless.  The only important thing to take from DAMAGED GOODS is that Russell T Davies is a damn good writer, and if he writes half as well for Doctor Who today as he did eight years ago, then I expect to be very pleased with the results.  If you had told me six months ago the new producer for TV Doctor Who was named \\"Russell\\", I think I would have been ill.  But reading DAMAGED GOODS has given me a lot of hope that Davies is the right Russell for the job.	2004-03-29
US	50631983	RR77RZYFF8RB6	0060934913	24249899	Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Two parts food, three parts testosterone	KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is the story of drug-taking in the stockroom, knife-fights in the kitchen, and lovemaking behind the bar.  It's supposedly an expose of what really goes on in the surprisingly gritty world of restauranteering, where life is more violent and dangerous than meets the eye.  It's an entertaining, hilarious and engaging read.  Is it completely 100% accurate?  I'm not qualified to answer that, but I feel emboldened enough to state that I don't really care much.  The result is far too satisfying to worry about little details like accuracy.<br />Anthony Bourdain has paid his dues; he leaves you in no doubt about that.  Starting with a love of food that began during his childhood, he tells the story of his slow rise from a variety of seedy and shady slop-houses to the ultimate in chefdom: a paid gig advising a French chef on the proper way to serve French food (albeit in a restaurant in Japan that wants a New York flavor).<br />As one might expect, it's Bourdain's bizarre associates who provide the book with many of its memorable moments.  From a co-worker who has to be fended off at knifepoint, to the various drug-addicts who appear to populate every kitchen known to humanity, these people just cracked me up.  There's an entire chapter devoted to a guy called Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown, who is, in all fairness, an absolute madman; one could easily imagine an whole book about this guy and his brushes with the law, his bakery experiments, his regular overdoses, etc.  Tellingly, this Adam guy is fairly representative of the memoir as a whole.<br />Bourdain's book bounces his around various dingy kitchens, looking for places to alternatively cook or intoxicate himself (he laments his short stay in Baltimore, a city he loathed, seemingly because he didn't know where to score drugs).  This is not a memoir for the sensitive reader, and not just for the reasons of finding out what's really in the soup you just ordered (although the book does occasionally wander into this territory).  Most of the time, I was laughing like a loon, even if the thought that I might have eaten in places like these made me cringe.  <br />Again, while I kept getting the feeling that he was exaggerating his story, he does disclaim that this book is fairly accurate, that he wanted to write a book that anyone in the industry could pick up and instantly identify with.  Perhaps he's right, and that the restaurant business is infinitely seedier than I could have imagined.  And, if so, I'm at least glad that it provides us with a memoir as wildly entertaining as this one.	2004-03-29
US	50631983	RI1GWXDS9OHU8	0553293397	345876674	The Naked Sun (The Robot Series)	Books	4	50	50	N	N	Naked Sun, won't you come, and wash away the rain	THE NAKED SUN is a witty little novel that is unmistakably a product of Isaac Asimov.  Not just because of the ubiquitous robots, but because of the familiar themes that Asimov explored over the course of his decades-long career.  On the surface, the novel is a science-fiction mystery story told in the author's usual enjoyable style.  But by the time I reached the end of the book, I realized that Asimov had been doing something a little cleverer than his normal runaround, and upon reaching the conclusion, I immediately flipped back and started revisiting some of the earlier scenes to catch what I had missed the first time around.<br />THE NAKED SUN starts up where THE CAVES OF STEEL left off, although you certainly do not need to have read the earlier book to enjoy this one.  Earthman Detective Elijah Baley is once again teamed up with R. (for Robot) Daneel Olivaw to solve an unexplained murder.  The gimmick this time is that the homicide occurred on one of the mysterious Outer Worlds, and Baley must not only act as policeman, but as an unofficial spy for an Earth government curious as to what the culture is like on those advanced, robot-dependent planets.<br />The mystery is rather clever, although I did figure out what the murder weapon must have been before Baley did.  As usual with Asimov's mysteries, I found myself enjoying the investigation more than the occasional plot logic that's thrown to the audience.  In the case of this book, the storyline has some solid twists and turns, the only real flaw being that the cast of characters is so small that one could just pick a suspect at random to have a pretty good shot of correctly identifying the killer.<br />The real star of this story is the universe that Asimov builds.  The Earth is still the lagging, suspicious and enclosed world of THE CAVES OF STEEL, but now we turn our attention out to one of the colony worlds, Solaria.  I could tell that Asimov was having a blast creating this society, giving us all kinds of details such as this planet's frosty relationship with Earth, its delicate relationship with other Outer Worlds, its population levels, its staggeringly high ratio of robots to people, etc.  But he has even more fun giving birth to the inhabitants.  He has them still as recognizable humans, but from an extremely skewed perspective.  For most of the book, it's the story of these strange people and their odd customs that overpowers what is currently going on in the murder investigation.  This definitely makes for an interesting read, as once we get to the end, we find that the detective portions were only secondary to the real point of the book.<br />Often Asimov would insert little bits of social commentary into his fictions, with varying levels of success.  And indeed, the summation at the end, where Baley lets the cat out of the bag and tells us what the novel has been exploring, is a little on the clumsy side.  But the real triumph is how the author quietly and cunningly led us down the garden path to the end.   When I opened the book to page one and found Elijah Baley nervously flying into a Washington, DC airport (by sheer coincidence I was making the same approach, albeit I started my journey in a different city than Baley had) and wishing to once again be safe indoors, I chucked to myself, recalling passages from Asimov's autobiography that discussed his legendary fear of flying and his mild claustrophilia.  While reading all this stuff about people who hate flying, people who have an unnatural fear of face-to-face meetings, and people who yearn for enclosed spaces, I assumed that Asimov was doing nothing more than his usual shtick of inserting his own neuroses into his fictions (there's nothing wrong with this; it can make for very interesting reading, and it's something I particularly enjoy from Asimov).  And with that assumption in place, I didn't pay much mind to what the author was actually setting up beneath the surface.  So when the end of the novel rolled around and it was suddenly revealed what he had been up to this whole time, I was very pleasantly surprised.<br />I like pulpy books that work on more than one level, and THE NAKED SUN gives us a very clever look at human fears while also providing an entertaining murder mystery.  No, the characters aren't terribly deep, but the plot is a fun one and the extra bit of world building that Asimov engages in raises this book up.  I like to read Asimov novels while traveling, because I find them to be a nice relaxing way to pass a few hours.  Anytime the good doctor can provide me with something even better and smarter than his usual high standard of amusing, whimsical adventures, I'm a very happy camper indeed.	2004-03-12
US	50631983	R1H76ED2PCJTZG	0140184937	588275666	Our Man in Havana: An Entertainment (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	4	68	70	N	N	Wickedly entertaining	I went into OUR MAN IN HAVANA with very few expectations.  I was under the vague impression that it was a thriller of sorts and I somehow knew that there had a been a film made out of it a number of decades back.  So I was a bit surprised when I started reading the book and found out that it was a comedy.  Surprised and delighted, because OUR MAN turned out to be one of the more understated and enjoyable satires that I've read in a good long time.<br />The book is a smart send up of a lot of the standard material one would have found in the noir films and books of the time (the novel was published in 1958, when the genre was starting to wear itself out).  A British secret agent, looking to increase his community of contacts, has arranged for an ordinary vacuum cleaner salesman to file reports of any unusual activity in the area.  The merchant, Mr. Wormold, reluctantly agrees to this arrangement for no reason other than the lure of extra money; he has a teenage daughter with very expensive tastes (to whit: men and horses).  To keep himself employable, Wormold constructs a whole world of intrigue to write home about.  The back-cover hints at one of the book's funnier gags, but all of Wormold's fictions (and especially the reaction they receive at the other end) are hilarious.<br />Despite the comic portions of the plot, the characters themselves are allowed to retain a certain dignity.  The prose is also as lush as one would expect from a Graham Greene novel.  One particular scene stood out as a wonderful piece of writing.  Placing two main characters inside a dark, dingy saloon, Greene describes the other inhabitants as looking like paratroopers about to parachute out of an airplane.  Their quick glances at the door and their hushed demeanor are all exquisitely described.  I like comedies as much as the next guy, but it's rare to find one that is simply this literate and also so entertaining.<br />OUR MAN IN HAVANA is a relatively short novel; my copy clocks in at just two hundred twenty pages.  It makes for a quick read, but not a throwaway one.  It's smooth enough to be read as a straightforward thriller, if that's what you're in the mood for, as its comedy is more on the subtle than on the broad side.  But, that said, the neat cuts of satire make this a hilarious and whimsical tale.	2004-03-08

Great.  I'd like to register a complaint about my copy of THE DEATH OF ART.  Yes.  The complaint is that none of it works.  No, nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Not a bell, not a whistle, and the only flashing lights are red.  Everything that I expect from a novel utterly failed to engage.  Is it possible I have a defective copy?<br />&quot;Yes, actually, I did try rebooting it.  Several times.  No, no, that didn't seem to help.  In fact, that made things much worse.  Every time I came back to the book after putting it down for a few hours, the situation had actually deteriorated.  The characters were so vague that after leaving them for even a moment, I simply couldn't remember anything about them.  I'd open the book again, stare at the page, and couldn't figure out who these people were, what they were doing, or how they got to be where they were.<br />&quot;Yeah, I did try flipping back to reread portions, but that didn't help either.  No, I'm pretty sure it's not me; it's the way it's written.  Well, okay, maybe it is me, but the way it's written doesn't do it any favors.  Let me explain; do you have a copy in front of you?  Open up to a chapter at random.  Now, count the number of pages in that chapter.  Five and a half?  Okay, great.  Now, go back and count the number of times that the scene changes.  Seven changes, meaning eight different scenes?  Okay, great.  So, what do those two numbers tell you?  Well, in virtually every chapter, the number of scene changes is greater than the number of pages.  Almost every sequence starts and concludes in less than a single page!  It's like a movie where no scene lasts for more than ten seconds.  It's like reading a nervous breakdown!  If they gave an award for Attention Deficit Disorder Theatre, this one would clean up.  How am I supposed to give a damn about any of these people, when they don't even bother to show up for more than half a page?<br />&quot;Oh, and how on Earth was I supposed to keep track of anyone when a) they all speak and act totally alike, and b) they all seem to pop in and out of each other's identities.  I dunno, maybe you could talk to your engineers and have them include a flowchart in future releases. Well, I think it would be a helpful feature.<br />&quot;Yes, I suppose it's very possible that some readers found the Quoth aliens to be interesting.  But seeing as how I'm not a microscopic alien from a highly stupid plane of reality, I wasn't one of them.<br />&quot;And what's with the whole Roz &quot;I love you, you ugly alien chick!&quot; thing?  And, could you tell me exactly how many oh-so-mysterious secret societies there were?  Yeah, I didn't think so...  No, no, I'm not blaming you; I couldn't figure it out either.  Oh, and how cheap was it to have those major info dumps in the middle of the book?  I mean, yes, we definitely need to have the plot explained to the reader, but it seemed a bit of a cheat to have a telepathic character having a mind-meld with the plot outline.<br />&quot;Well, to get back to the point of my call, it's obvious that my copy is defective and I'd like a refund.  Oh, yeah, it's definitely been more than thirty days since I bought the book.  But couldn't you make an exception?  I mean, no, I don't consider &quot;incomprehensible&quot; and &quot;turgid&quot; to be prose features rather than bugs.<br />&quot;Well, in that case, I think I should inform you that this load is getting a mighty One Out Of Ten on Shannon Patrick Sullivan's ranking page.  The only reason it's not getting a big old goose egg is that there isn't any actual physical scarring I can point to on my person.  Emotional scarring, sure.  I mean, the next time I fall into the tenth dimension, or see a 19th Century Frenchman suddenly mutate into something pointless, I'm going to have flashbacks from hell, I can tell you.&quot;<br />(The writer of this review wouldlike to thank the late, great MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 show, from which I shamelessly stole the format for this tech support call.)	2004-03-01

RETURN OF THE LIVING DAD.  A Kate Orman novel that I didn't like.  And I don't really think it's a particularly bad novel, per say, but rather that there were a lot of little things that annoyed me, and they slowly built up.  By the time I got to the end, I just wasn't in the mood for it any more.  Too much in-jokiness.  Too much fluffiness.  In short, too much style, not enough substance.<br />I think that the book's biggest problem is that, paradoxically, it contains both too much and too little plot.  There's a lot of actual action, but very little feels of consequence.  Let me describe what I'm talking about.  The book starts with Benny and Jason finding a clue as to what happened to Benny's long-lost father.  So, they meet up with the Doctor, Chris and Roz.  Then they jump back in time.  Then they go through a time warp.  Then they spend some time in 1983.  Then someone gets captured.  Then there's a jailbreak.  Then someone else is captured.  Then there's another escape attempt.  Etc, etc, etc.  There is actually a lot of plot; the problem is that it's all paper-thin.<br />And there's also something that had previously annoyed me in Paul Cornell's HUMAN NATURE that is turned up to eleven here: the fandom in-jokes.  Specifically, the near constant references to rec.arts.drwho.  Now, I was a regular in that newsgroup during the period that this book was written, so I recognize many of the references.  The problem is that as soon as I come across one of these, I'm mentally taken out of the book and placed back into USEnet of the mid-1990s.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course, but I don't think the author expects me to be thinking more about long-dead running jokes and flame-wars than about the book that's in front of me.<br />Don't get me wrong.  Sometimes references to outside material can add immensely to a story and can make the reader think about things in more than one way.  This is true whether the reference is to a previous story in the series (&quot;Oh, so the bad guys from story X were working for the evil guy from story Y.  Hmmm, that's quite interesting.&quot;) or to material outside the fiction completely (&quot;Oooh, a subtle satire of early-20th century American foreign policy!  How clever!&quot;).  With references of the kind seen here, my reaction is rather different (&quot;Hey!  It's old whatshisname from rec.arts.drwho!  What a nut that guy was!  Wasn't he the guy who stole someone's airline ticket to get to Visions and then drunkenly demanded that Sophie Aldred look at his crayon drawings of K9?&quot;  -- this is a simulated convention story; if it were an actual convention story, it would involve an NA author and alcohol poisoning.)  Slight references I can stomach, but I swear that some of the conversations were complete cut-n-paste jobs (the UNIT-dating example springs instantly to mind).<br />Getting back to the story proper, this desperately felt like it wanted to be a HAPPY ENDINGS style adventure, where there's little in the way of plot and just a lot of fun frolicking instead.  But it seems almost afraid to go too far in that direction.  Every time it looks as though it's going to settle down into pure romp mode, someone needs rescuing, or an alien's gone missing, or the Doctor gets angsty.  It felt as though it was trying too hard to be fun and to be an adventure, and instead of being a fun adventure, it just ended up as a misfire.  Benny's father, Isaac, would appear to have to bulk of the story resting on his fictional shoulders, but since the character just didn't quite work for me, I could never really get into the book.<br />Still, it's not all bad.  It's an Orman novel, so we're assured of some deft prose.  The story is well paced and I never felt bored (compare this to THE DEATH OF ART which I'm struggling through right now; I may literally fall dead of old age before I get through it all).  There are a handful of nice scenes and great character moments.  They just sort of felt grafted on, or isolated.  <br />I was disappointed rereading this one.  I don't really recall much of anything from my first reading, which should probably have set off some warning bells.  Of course, when looking back at this period of the NAs, it's noticeable that if you don't like the Kate Orman novel you're reading, there's no need to worry: a different one will be along in a couple of months.  And fortunately, I think everything else she's done has been better than this one.	2004-02-08
US	50631983	R2MYKKP86NRV3Z	0316330116	154225661	On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society	Books	5	453	488	N	Y	A fascinating study	ON KILLING is the study of what author Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has termed &quot;killology&quot;.  This odd term describes, not killing between nations, but the exact circumstances involved when one individual ends the life of another individual, with the primary focus being on combat situations.  I've sometimes wondered how I (someone who has never been anywhere near armed conflict) would fare on the frontlines, as killing another human being seems like an almost impossible psychological task.  As Grossman casts an eye over historical reports of combat, he found that, apparently, I wasn't alone in thinking that.  During the First and Second World Wars, officers estimated that only 15-20 percent of their frontline soldiers actually fired their weapons, and there is evidence to suggest that most of those who did fire aimed their rifles harmless above the heads of their enemy.<br />Grossman's argument is carefully researched and methodically laid out.  He begins by filling in some historical details, discussing the statistics for shots fired per soldier killed for the World Wars and the American Civil War.  It's a refreshing and enlightening look at war that dispels a lot of misconceptions.  An average solder in those wars was extremely reluctant to take arms against fellow humans, even in cases where his own life (or the lives of his companions) was threatened.  Not to say that any of these people are cowards; in fact, many would engage in brave acts such as rescuing their comrades from behind enemy lines or standing in harm's way while helping a fellow to reload.  But the ability to stare down the length of a gun barrel and make a conscious effort to end a life is a quality that is happily rare.<br />The book continues on then, detailing what steps the US Army took to increase the percentage that they could get to actually fire upon their enemy.  By studying precisely what the soldier's ordinary reactions were, the officers were able to change the scenario of war in order to avoid the most stressful of situations.  The soldier found up-close killing to be abhorrent, so the emphasis was countered by inserting machinery (preferably one manned by multiple soldiers) between the killer and the enemy to increase the physical and emotional distance.  Every effort is made to dehumanize the act of killing.  <br />Grossman spends a great deal of time discussing the trauma that the solder who kills faces when he returns to civilian life.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in those veterans who returned from Vietnam.  Those soldiers had been psychologically trained to kill in a way that no previous army had gone through, and there was no counteragent working to heal their psychological wounds.  Grossman takes great pains to discuss how horrifying the act of killing is, and points out how detrimental it is to one's mental health.  When the Vietnam veterans returned home to no counseling and the spit and bile of anti-war protestors, the emotional effect was astounding.  Most of Grossman's thesis is supported by in-depth interviews and psychological profiles, but it is the story of the Vietnam veterans that comes across as the most disturbing.<br />Much of the chatter about this book seems to revolve around the final section, the discussion about our own civilian society.  While this is understandable, I actually preferred reading the earlier portions, simply because they opened my eyes to a lot about the military that I had been previously ignorant of.  I think it would be a mistake to concentrate solely on the argument's conclusion as it rests heavily on the case that has been building. In any event, the book eventually develops its final conclusion: the methods that the military uses to desensitize its soldiers to killing are also being used in our media, but without the proper command structure that keeps people from killing indiscriminately.  In a military situation, firing a weapon without proper authorization or instruction is a very serious offense, and this is drilled into the mind at the same time as the desensitization.  Without this safety, there is nothing to hold back the killing instinct, and this is one of the main reasons why the homicide rate has increased so dramatically.<br />Now, I'll say right off the bat that I was partial to this line of argument before I read the book; I think that children repeatedly exposed to such images would almost certainly become blasé towards extreme violence.  But Grossman's book gave me so much more to think about.  It isn't just a Pavlovian force at work here; Grossman points out many reasons (both stemming from society and the changing family structure) for why young people of today seem much more able to kill than their parents and grandparents were.<br />I was honestly surprised at how strong of a writer Grossman is.  He manages to put forth his argument without boring the reader.  By its very nature, a lot of what he discusses is repetitive and disturbing, but the subject matter is so compelling that I didn't mind.  Grossman is very logical in his approach and his argument is a powerful one.  I highly recommend this book, especially for people like myself who have never experienced war at close quarters.  The summary I (and others here) have given is simply not nearly adequate to capture all of Grossman's thorough contentions.  ON KILLING made me think harder about a subject that I hadn't given a lot of thought too before.  The information and research here is invaluable.	2004-01-24
US	50631983	R2WWREHRAZ0VNW	1903889049	113635871	Citadel of Dreams (Doctor Who)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Cartmel Of Daves	It seemed appropriate that Dave Stone's CITADEL OF DREAMS would have a foreword by Andrew Cartmel, as a number of elements in the novella reminded me of the latter's own Doctor Who books.  The Seventh Doctor is used quite sparingly, and is only really onscreen for a handful of pages.  The book deals with psychic powers, something that Cartmel was fond of employing (in his fiction, I mean).  Ace has a house, not totally unlike the dwelling at Allen Road that serves as her base of operations.  And, of course, there's the old Cartmel standby: people soiling themselves.  Oh dear; maybe some things would be better left unstolen.<br />But superficial comparisons to Andrew Cartmel's work aside, I really found myself enjoying this.  Of the Dave Stone books I've read so far, I would rate this as probably his strongest work.  It contains a lot of the sort of thing that we've seen before from Stone, but it feels fresh and not at all tired.  I get the impression that the shorter size of the novella format caused Stone to rely on his strengths.  And as I'm someone who appreciates those strengths but fears his self-indulgences, I was grateful for that.<br />The story concerns a city -- a city that we see from two separate time zones.  At first, we aren't sure exactly how far apart temporally these two eras are.  In one time, labeled &quot;before&quot;, we see a run-down, decaying inner city, with random crime and brutal, unfeeling authorities.  In the &quot;after&quot; zone, there exists a utopia of sorts.  But the people there seem to possess whacking great holes in their knowledge.  The reader is lead through the mystery via a character named Joey Quine, who lives in the &quot;before&quot; time and has strange psychic abilities.<br />I really enjoyed the parts of the story told from Quine's point of view.  The sections concerning him coming to terms with and then taking advantage of his own unique mental abilities are told with sensitivity and style.  This sort of thing could easily have been hooky and clichéd, but Dave Stone did a really good job, and frankly, I'm surprised; I didn't think he was capable of pulling it off.<br />It's extremely well paced; I managed to read the entire thing in one sitting while looking to kill some time before (what turned out to be) the final Baltimore Ravens game of the 2003 season (sob!).  The plot is not easy to follow, but rewarding when it all comes together at the end.  I thought I was clever by spotting the book's Big Surprise by the midway point, but looking at reviews on the 'net, apparently everyone else figured it out too.  I should mention that guessing what the twist was didn't diminish anything, as seeing how the story got there was still fun.<br />Of course, some of Dave Stone's more annoying authorial tendencies are also on display here.  He has a habit of throwing italics around with abandon to emphasize particular words, rather than structuring the sentence in such a way that the word is highlighted by the grammar instead of the font.  (You know the type of thing I'm talking about.  Pg 34: &quot;...it was hard to even *think* about it in terms of description...&quot;  Pg 31: &quot;...there were certain obvious things he *could* do...&quot;  Pg 77: &quot;...certain things that she *liked* about this world...&quot;)  Although I find this annoying, repetitive and lazy, I'm not usually bothered by it when used in moderation.  But here Stone seems to rely too heavily on this voice, using it sometimes three times a page.  And, I swear, if Stone ever again describes an alien as being &quot;too different to describe&quot; or &quot;something which the human brain cannot possibly understand&quot;, I'll jump out the window.  Okay, so Stone obviously can't describe an &quot;otherness&quot; concept without falling back on the same stock phrases.  But can't we create some new stock phrases?  Please?<br />Overall, I enjoyed CITADEL OF DREAMS.  It tells a good story quickly.  Although the beginning isslow to get started, by the end the plot is bouncing along.  It's a great way to spend a few hours; I just hope it brings you better luck than it brought me.	2004-01-13
US	50631983	R2453F63ONAI5P	042620476X	792478329	Christmas on a Rational Planet (Doctor Who: The New Adventures)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	So this is Christmas...	I came to CHRISTMAS ON A RATIONAL PLANET in rather a roundabout way.  While this was Lawrence Miles' first piece of work for the Doctor Who canon, I have only arrived at it recently, after already having read the bulk of his fiction.  It gives one an odd perspective.  If CHRISTMAS were released today, it would probably be regarded as almost a Greatest Hits collection; it encapsulated a lot of the themes that Miles would develop further on down the line.  Some aspects are quite blatant, while others are subtle.  But it's interesting to see them here in their infancy -- warts and all.<br />CHRISTMAS ON A RATIONAL PLANET indeed has a plot, although the themes are running so heavily through the story that the actual events feel almost like an afterthought.  (This does work to the novel's advantage though, as it isn't a plot-driven story and Miles takes the needed time to allow many of his themes to flourish.)  It takes the crew a little while to get to the layout suggested by the back cover, but eventually the Doctor and Roz explore a small town in New York State in 1799, while Chris is lost inside a strangely malfunctioning and disintegrating TARDIS.  <br />A large number of the Doctor Who novels written by first-time writers share a striking characteristic: the Let's Throw In Everything But The Kitchen Sink Syndrome.  Although it is generally regarded as a bad thing, it can occasionally feel like a burst of fresh air as a struggling author goes for broke trying to impress us.  CHRISTMAS shares this feature, and it brings the associated advantages and disadvantages.  Miles would learn in time to restrain his themes to a smaller number per book, giving them time to breath without having to jump around between various topics.  His &quot;Reason versus Superstition/Magic&quot; stuff would be done better in ADVENTURESS OF HENRIETTA STREET.  His mob mentality discussions would feel more at home in his INTERFERENCE.  And his Time Lord mythology-building would get a whole bookto grow in ALIEN BODIES (though for the record I should point out that the Time Lord stuff he does do in CHRISTMAS is about a thousand times more interesting than the stuff he would later come up with for the early BBC books).<br />CHRISTMAS ON A RATIONAL PLANET was a book that I very much enjoyed while I was reading it, but its flaws become more apparent with distance.  Some of the plot strands take too long to get to the point, while others go on for quite a while and never do get to their objective.  The book is sort of like seeing a really good magic show and being impressed at the time, but managing to figure out where the strings and trap-doors must have been while you make your way out of the theatre.  Still, it's a damn good show, and the flaws do not distract hugely from the work as a whole.  It's not the greatest Doctor Who book that in the Miles canon, but it isn't the worst either.  And, as always, Miles' prose manages to convey an aura of overbearing menace.	2004-01-03

I feel cheated by the fact that I have only just got around to reading GODENGINE.  Now all my &quot;GodAwful&quot; jokes are going to be seven years out of date.<br />GODENGINE has an abysmal beginning.  It gradually improved through the middle and the end, albeit not by much.  This was something of a relief though; if the book hadn't improved at all, then I'm not sure I'd be sitting here in possession of enough faculties to write this humble review.<br />Where to begin, where to begin?  Well, let's start by mentioning the staggering overload of continuity references.  If you can believe it, this book is a follow up to at least three stories (TRANSIT, DALEK INVASION OF EARTH, and SEEDS OF DEATH) and contains pointless mentions of dozens of others.  Set on Mars, every Doctor Who villain who ever even thought of vacationing on the red planet is given at least a name-check, and the Ice Warriors themselves feature prominently.  Two people are even blood relatives of characters from previous tales.  What is the point of this kind of thing?    Continuity references can add an interesting layer to an individual story, or give it a flavor unique to that series.  But these constant and random mentions of much better stories make this book look like a quiche designed by someone who's never even heard of food before.<br />GODENGINE wants to be a TV story so badly it hurts.  Character motivations are betrayed by facial expressions.  A double agent's identity is revealed because he/she accidentally drops the act while thinking he/she is alone.  Important plot points are passed on to the audience by having people making speeches at each other about things that they should already know.  There's even an &quot;our story so far&quot; recap at the beginning of the book's Part II.  (Why?  Why do I need to be reminded of stuff that only just happened a little while ago?  Granted, I was falling asleep during most of it, but it's not like we were dealing with difficult to grasp conceptshere.)<br />The development of the Ice Warriors' back-story that takes place while those monsters are off-screen is relatively effective.  We see their architecture, their culture, and a little bit about what makes them tick.  But when they're actually on the page, they descend into the worst clichés imaginable.  They're like the very worst of the TNG-era Klingons, endlessly spouting on about honor and duty. (&quot;You have no honor!&quot;  &quot;No, you have no honor!&quot;  &quot;No, you have no honor!&quot;  &quot;By belittling my honor you have shown yourself to be totally without honor!  You have dishonored your family's honor!&quot;  &quot;Argh, poo-fart!&quot;) <br />When it became clear that this wasn't going to be a story too broad or too deep for the small screen, I attempted to enjoy the book purely on a pulpy action-adventure level.  But even the shallowest dime novel has to have something good to latch onto: a fast-moving plot, or some interesting characters, or a witty style.  None are to be seen here.  This plot is awkwardly paced with long, long gaps of filler.  Too much of it relies on the most unbelievable of coincidences.  Characters are stupid one minute, and geniuses the next.  One of the funniest contrivances is that apparently the ID card of the Adjudicators goes virtually unchanged for over eight centuries.  Eight centuries of the same design!  In my four and something years as an undergrad, my school changed ID card formats three times, but the Adjudicators of the thirtieth century will still be using logos designed in the twenty-second.  I've got to admire that consistency, but you have to imagine that their PR budget is around zero.<br />The characters are, unfortunately, molecule-thin.  So thin, in fact, that I believe that Wile E. Coyote himself personally ran over each and every one of them with a steamroller before their inclusion in this book.  I could ramble on for a few hundred more words about how silly these people were, but I'lllimit myself to just saying one additional thing.  To any prospective Doctor Who author: please, don't ever, ever, ever include an Ice Warrior love triangle.  Oh, the pain, the pain, the pain.<br />Ultimately, I was glad to see the end of GODENGINE.  One of the most derivative novels that the New Adventures produced, I'm not sure I can point to a single original idea on any of the book's pages.  I have no doubts that if I were to go back with a magnifying glass, I'd be able to conjure up at least one inventive turn of phrase or line of dialog.  But I think you'd have to pay me to reexamine my copy of GODENGINE.<br />(To be fair, I should point out that in my travels through the Google Groups archives, I discovered that apparently this book was written in quite a bit of a hurry.  I'm guessing that if the author and the editor had more time available to them, this book would have turned out very different.  It's a pity that the extra months weren't there, because this book really could have used them.)	2003-12-24
US	50631983	R3O26HLP7MWLDE	0345278739	855781794	Kalki	Books	4	23	24	N	N	That '70s Book	KALKI is very much a product of its time.  And, as that time was the late '70s, one can see that the book is obsessed with many of the same things that other products of that era were fascinated by.  The main protagonist is a female, she's an avowed feminist, she's overtly bisexual, she's an airplane test pilot, she constantly thinks about Amelia Earhart, and her autobiography was a rejection of motherly values, ghost-written by a man selected by her publishing company.<br />The rest of the story is similarly '70s in flavor.  An Eastern/Hindu religious sect is claiming that their god Kalki has been reincarnated in the form of an ex-army soldier from the American Midwest.  Their scripture claims that when Kalki returns to ride the white horse, the world will end soon afterwards; only the chosen few will survive.  Naturally, since this is the '70s, everyone on the planet becomes obsessed with the Kalki story.  The newsmagazine show, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; produces an unusually long segment investigating the Kalki phenomenon.  Even Walter Cronkite gets into the act, making an amused comment on the impending end of the world.<br />In between the references to Watergate and the mentions of Ronald Reagan, there's a very effective religious satire going on here.  Gore Vidal paints his satirical strokes a little broad at times, but when he focuses, the story soars.  Fun is poked at, not only the religious cults that were springing up at the time, but many aspects of pop culture.  Some of the jokes still apply today, of course.  In fact, were this book to be written now, many of the shots at television news coverage wouldn't need to be changed at all.<br />Although the book seems most concerned with its satire, it also works extremely well as straight adventure/thriller.  A genuinely enjoyable story, I simply could not figure out what direction it was going to go in next.  The gothic tone of the ending slips in nicely after the whimsy of the beginning and middle.  Vidal manages to get the balance of comedy and drama just right.  Some moments are laugh out loud funny, while a page later one will be faced with sudden and utter horror.	2003-12-22
US	50631983	R3029FO67OM4EA	0426204700	872005086	Happy Endings (Doctor Who: The New Adventures) (The New Doctor Who Series)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	&quot;You once said that you liked Happy Endings.&quot; -- Pulp	When I first read HAPPY ENDINGS, I was amused.  Reading it again in 2003, I was downright tickled.  This book is hilarious; I couldn't stop laughing.  (And, no, I wasn't laughing at the book, I was laughing with it.)  Paul Cornell combines many things together in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible.  HAPPY ENDINGS celebrates the publication of the fiftieth New Adventure, manages to tie up loose ends from the previous forty-nine novels, and still arrives with a story that is much more entertaining than it has any right being.<br />HAPPY ENDINGS is primary the story of companion Bernice Summerfield's marriage to that horribly one-dimensional character from the previous novel.  While the plot does make very few journeys outside that premise, it rarely wanders away from the wedding story for very long.  After bringing the Relatively Happy Couple to the proverbial sleepy English village of Cheldon in the year 2010, the Doctor spends most of the story scurrying around, importing aliens from all over time and space.  The characters amuse themselves in various subplots relating to the wedding.  Most of the scenes and sequences are surprisingly short, but this just helps the novel maintain its pleasantly quick pace.<br />It should be mentioned, of course, that not all of the tie-ins to previous novels are successful.  In fact, the book opens with a shockingly poor coda to THE HIGHEST SCIENCE, which only served to remind this reader of just how annoying that story was.  Thankfully, the vast majority of the successive references are much more fun, and, indeed, much less awkward.  Once the book really gets going, the past slips smoothly into the present, and while it's still obviously a continuity fest, it somehow manages to integrate these pieces well.<br />As for the plot, well, it's practically nonexistent.  Which is a relief to be honest.  The story is purely a romp and the narrative follows the romp in whatever direction it decides to lurch rather than sticking purely to plot lines.  The result is hugely enjoyable and utterly unpredictable.  It shouldn't come as a surprise that some of the book's least good moments are those when the plot rears its angry little head and demands attention.  (The other least good moments are, of course, the now hopelessly out of date rec.arts.drwho in-jokes.)<br />I almost always enjoy the actual process of reading Cornell's prose, even in the books that I didn't like.  And I think the writing here ranks with his best.  The sentences and words have a wonderful free-flowing quality to them.  They just pour gently off the page with me scarcely aware of the fact that I'm reading them.  In other, weightier stories, Cornell would successfully use this to throw some stunning and shocking things at the audience.  In this book, he manages to sneak some hilarious jokes under the reader's radar until the punch line leaps right off of the page for maximum impact.<br />It shouldn't (indeed, it can't) be forgotten that this is primary a book for the fans of the New Adventures, and it's almost impossible to appreciate it in any other way.  Most of the great scenes are built around those whimsical set pieces that would most appeal to those warriors who have braved the prose that had come before.  Some of the book's more successful passages include Sherlock Holmes and Roz Forrester solving a case together, the UNIT family getting one last story together, and Dr. Watson jealously regarding Benny's fiancé.  Other moments, such as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart finally coming face to face, are unabashed attempts to stroke the average fan's funny-bone, yet they work.<br />I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this reading of HAPPY ENDINGS.  Of course, the last time I read the book, I didn't have nearly as many New Adventures under my belt as I do now, so probably caught many more of the jokes this time around.  But even the sections that weren't specifically funny were, at the very least, entertaining.  And as a romp celebrating the past and present, it's hard to ask for more than that.	2003-12-18

YOU COULD CALL IT MURDER is an incredibly short book; it's practically a novella.  My copy clocks in at a slim 168 pages, has a slightly larger than average font, and greater-than-necessary spacing between the lines.  The story itself is also fairly small in scale.  It's a typical noir adventure, but told with enough spark to make it a reasonably enjoyable book.<br />The novel is so short that it's hard to discuss anything specific about it without potentially venturing into spoiler-territory, so I'll be brief.  In short, this book is filled with the usual sort of stuff pertaining to this genre.  There are tough guys, fast women, lots of boozing and smoking, a shootout with the baddie, murder, and blackmail; you get the idea.  None of this material is in any way original, yet the story moves quickly enough for it to be a lot of fun.  <br />YOU COULD CALL IT MURDER is definitely not the best noir novel ever published, but, luckily, it isn't the worst either.  I didn't love the book; I just found it entertaining while I was reading it.  I may never read it again, but it did provide me with a quick little shot of noir, which is exactly what I wanted.  It's short enough that you can read it in a single, lazy afternoon, and there are much poorer ways you could spend that afternoon.  If you like this kind of thriller, then you'll probably like this &quot;lite&quot; version.	2003-12-15

Why am I bothering?  Nothing in DEATH AND DIPLOMACY inspired me to sit in front of a keyboard and type out my thoughts.  The only excuse I have for putting fingertip to key is that I've done this for the first forty-eight New Adventures, and I might as well keep going for this one.  It's a struggle though.  Almost as much of a struggle as reading the book was.  The book is just so pointless, really.  I mean, would the world be that much worse off if this book had never seen the light of day?  Did an author really wake up in the middle of the night screaming, &quot;Yes!  This is a story that absolutely MUST BE TOLD!&quot;<br />One can see from the beginning that this is not exactly going to be a tightly plotted and intricately detailed story.  The regulars are so clumsily separated, one wonders if this is supposed to be some hilarious meta-textual joke; if it is, it fails.  In any case, Benny, Roz and Chris fall out of the TARDIS and become embroiled in subplots of their own.  The Roz and Chris story is so clichéd and unoriginal that it scary bears discussing; let's just say that it puts the &quot;bog&quot; in &quot;bog-standard&quot; and we'll not speak of it again.<br />The Doctor's story actually appears to be relatively interesting for a while.  Not because it's an engaging or witty narrative, but because there is a hint of some fascinating world-building going on.  The Doctor finds himself in a portion of the galaxy inhabited by three different war-like space-faring races.  The three are perfectly balanced as far as position and weaponry is concerned.  So naturally, the Doctor shows up just as they are being ordered by their mysterious Hollow Gods to engage in a peace summit.<br />Unfortunately, this subplot eventually devolves into bland people walking quickly through corridors while Discussing Important Things.  There are a few surprises to be had here, but by the time they're sprung I had gone beyond the point of caring.  At one point, a character who belongs to one of those three races realizes that after spending time with his enemies he has begun thinking of them as people rather than faceless monsters.  I wish I could have said the same thing.  For the most part, all of the characters are as flat as the page they're printed on.  The story takes the lazy road of telling us that these are three-dimensional characters without showing us anything to back up its own statements.<br />Now, the real meat of the book is contained in the passages involving Benny and her soon-to-be fiancé.  I actually kind of enjoyed these sections, though they certainly feel superficial.  Jason comes across as a standard pulp character, not too much depth apart from that which is applied with all the subtlety of a thrown brick.  He's a relatively fun character, though I'm not sure he exactly works as a romantic foil for Benny.<br />Overall, well, this is a very mixed bag, ultimately with more negatives to its name than I would like.  Sure, I laughed at a handful of the jokes, but I rolled my eyes at others.  And that, is pretty much my summing up of this novel.  It's slightly clever in one or two places, but never gets anywhere near to being as funny or as smart as it thinks it is.<br />The book opens with a rather defensive note from the author where he haughtily suggests (more or less) that there's a lot more going on in his books than people realize and that, damnit, people ought to appreciate it.  My own comment to future authors out there is that this is a terrible way to start a novel.  A novel should stand or fall on its own merits, so if you're going to blind us all with your brilliance, make sure you write a better book than DEATH AND DIPLOMACY.	2003-12-08
US	50631983	RDSKGFPRTI4ZP	0316779237	383741816	Holidays on Ice: Stories	Books	3	3	6	N	Y	A mixed drink	On the Friday after Thanksgiving 2003, a news report circulated telling us of a woman trampled nearly to death during a mad rush in an early morning sale at her local Wal-Mart.  Underneath her bruised and broken body was discovered a sad cardboard box containing an ultra-cheap DVD player, which the store managers kindly put on hold for her.<br />The above story is something that isn't a million miles away from the non-fiction Christmas stories told in HOLIDAYS ON ICE.  All these stories have the ring of truth about them even (as in the anecdote I mentioned above) if one suspects that the facts may have been somewhat embellished.  It's their inherent believability that makes them funny.  But once David Sedaris moves towards outright fiction, his stories are less successful.  It feels as though he is constantly trying to outdo himself, making the stories more and more outrageous for fear that the mundane may not be as funny as the shocking.<br />In any case, here are some quick comments on each of the five essays that make up this short collection:<br />\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" -- David Sedaris entertains us with his stories of working a terrible job as one of Santa's elves in a Macy's department store.  This is the highlight of the collection - a very funny piece indeed.  People are funny to Sedaris.  From the utterly bizarre people who take on the role of Santa and his elves to the equally strange people who show up to wander through SantaLand, all of them provide us with many laughs.<br />\\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends And Family!!!\\" -- Not one of the more successful efforts in this collection.  Oh, the initial idea is amusing enough, but the execution leaves much to be desired.  In short, this is a parody of one of those over the top generic Christmas letters than some people will mail out to everyone they know in an attempt to compress an entire year's worth of news into a single newsletter-sized message.  The essay is funnier when it's mocking the little things that go into these communications (the overuse of multiple explanation points, the disturbingly flowery language), but less funny when it tries to tell it's story.<br />\\"Dinah, The Christmas Whore\\" -- The story of the Sedaris family taking in a lady of the evening.  This essay is rather short, and ends up feeling more sweet than funny (though it's definitely amusing).  <br />\\"Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol\\" -- An even shorter essay than the previous offering, but it is hilarious.  Yes, one of the more annoying things about the holidays is being dragged to the inevitable children's production of some Christmas themed story.  Or, to be more specific, an adult directing a group of unenthusiastic children in a horribly boring play.  Sedaris perfectly captures the deep, deep horror that each self-aware member of the audience will experience if forced to attend one of these ghastly affairs. <br />\\"Based Upon a True Story\\" -- Yikes.  I didn't care for this one at all.  An amoral television producer comes to a small town on Christmas to ask permission for the filming of a Based On A True Story TV Movie.  This might have been much more amusing had Sedaris not beaten us over the head with his satire.<br />\\"Christmas Means Giving\\" -- Again, a fictional story, and, again, not as successful as the true-life memoirs.  This details the escalation that two families undergo in their attempt to become the biggest present-giver in the neighborhood.  Sedaris abandons any attempt of subtlety and instead goes for over-the-top laughs.<br />As you may have gathered, all of the stories in this small collection revolve around the holidays, and there's a lot of comedy fruit to be harvested from that time of year.  But for as many as he successfully picks, he bludgeons others to pulp.  It was a short collection so even the uninteresting pieces don't drag on for too long.  HOLIDAYS ON ICE makes for a handy antidote to anyone feeling overwhelmed by the \\"holiday cheer\\" that comes around without fail every year at this time.	2003-12-07
US	50631983	R1NMB5XRKNZ9XS	0563405910	71465567	The Infinity Doctors (Doctor Who Series)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	The greatest Doctor Who story of them all?	Since this is the month that Doctor Who turns forty years old (who's bringing the whoopee cushion to the Doctor's birthday party?), I decided to look back to the last anniversary year that was evenly divisible by five.  The thirty-fifth anniversary was celebrated by the release of THE INFINITY DOCTORS by Lance Parkin (his first effort for BBC books).  I can't remember the last time that the thirty-fifth anniversary of anything was celebrated, but if we indeed must celebrate every fifth anniversary of the series by a special release, we could do a lot worse than to have releases of the quality on display here.<br />THE INFINITY DOCTORS starts with a passage that's more than a little reminiscent of the beginning of Paul Cornell's TIMEWYRM: REVELATION.  But, tellingly, it's not just a rehash of that earlier piece of prose; it takes that reference and directs it in a new and equally good direction.  And throughout much of this story, there are elements that are, if not borrowed, at least seem a little bit familiar.  But that isn't a criticism.  In fact, it's a bonus.  It's got enough references to the past to fulfill its role as an anniversary romp, while managing to tell an original enough story to prevent a complete wallowing in nostalgia.  It's a fine line to walk, one that gets more difficult with every passing divisible-by-five year anniversary.  I'm frankly surprised that it's still possible to get away with it.<br />THE INFINITY DOCTORS is painted on a huge canvas.  The background to the story involves a High Councilor of Gallifrey known as the Doctor who is organizing a peace treaty between the Sontarans and the Rutans, two races who have been locked in combat for countless millennia.  The power of the Time Lords has plucked two representatives of those races from an appropriate period in history and the Doctor is working as an arbiter.  But, naturally, things are not going as planned.  A slight blip on the Time Lord equivalent of a radar screen spells consequences and disaster, not only for their world, but for all worlds everywhere.<br />There's a line one can draw from Terrance Dicks, to Robert Holmes, to the Cartmel Masterplan, to here.  Each took what fictional facts were known about the Doctor's people, threw away the bad, and expanded the rest.  Terrance Dicks turned the creators of the TARDIS into Gods.  Robert Holmes kept their great powers and jettisoned their God-like status, making them into squabbling academics.  The Cartmel Masterplan built upon the legends and the fragments of the Old Time of Gallifrey, based almost entirely on Omega's speeches in THE THREE DOCTORS and the recording of the history of Gallifrey that Engin plays in THE DEADLY ASSASSIN.  It ignored all the boring and awful stories that had been built up in the current day Gallifrey (it's interesting to note that in the three years of Andrew Cartmel's script editorship, modern Gallifrey appeared on screen exactly zero times).<br />THE INFINITY DOCTORS plays a similar game.  Virtually the whole foundation of Parkin's Gallifrey is based on those hints and stories that displayed the best that Gallifrey had to offer, and it conveniently ignores those bits that make a discriminating fanboy shudder.  So, we delve heavily into the stories of the Old Times, but we have not a mention of the Time Tots.  The result is a \\"set on Gallifrey\\" story as they should be told, with mystery, excitement and power, not as they were told during the Graham Williams and John Nathan-Turner eras, which featured less than satisfying adventures.<br />Now before I get completely overwhelmed by talk of Gallifrey, Time Lords and all that jazz, I should talk about how the book works as a standalone story.  THE INFINITY DOCTORS feels epic.  Not just because it features The Return Of You-Know-Who (Again), but because of its subject matter.  We have a book with effective and powerful prose.  It starts slow and steady, which makes the later conflicts appear that much more menacing.<br />I have fond memories of my first reading of THE INFINITY DOCTORS.  It was the book that got me back into the world of Doctor Who novels after a double-whammy of the book license switchover and a horrendous lack of free time conspired to pull me away.  THE INFINITY DOCTORS may not be the greatest Doctor Who story of all time (though it's damn close, the only minor problems are slight authorial indulgences that the editor should have curtailed), but it might be the most representative.  It's got everything: time travel, old enemies, world building, an intriguing plot, devious and enjoyable characters, and the fate of the universe at stake.  It even throws in some rarer elements, but makes them feel perfectly at home (by this, I mean the romance; who would have guessed that it could turn out so well in a Doctor Who story?).  This is the single anniversary story that you could give to a non-fan and have he/she both understand it and enjoy it.  If I were to be trapped on the proverbial deserted island with my pick of only one Doctor Who story to take with me, then I can only say that THE INFINITY DOCTORS would make a very strong case for being that selection.<br />This month, the fortieth anniversary month, the Doctor Who release is either THE DEADLY REUNION by Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks, or THE SCREAM OF THE SHALKA by Paul Cornell, depending on what your medium of choice is.  Call it a hunch, but I seriously doubt that the fortieth anniversary will be celebrated in as progressive or as satisfying a manner as the thirty-fifth was.	2003-11-24
US	50631983	R3J8NKV8SKXONU	0060934727	960634322	Mike Nelson's Death Rat!	Books	4	15	16	N	N	What do you expect from a book named &quot;Death Rat&quot;?	MIKE NELSON'S DEATH RAT is the story of an aging history writer who decides to write a thriller after being inspired by the assembly line of Tom Clancy hardware-stories.  But in order to appeal to today's discriminating book-reader who bases their purchases on what the author's bio picture looks like, author Pontius Feeb decides to hire a young, rugged-looking young man to claim authorship of the work.  Naturally, hilarity ensues when the publishers accidentally market the book as a non-fiction tome, which is complicated by the fact that Feeb has a written a story about a supernatural giant rat.  This short summary should give you at least a glimpse into the madness that lies within this book.<br />I was a fan of Mike Nelson's first two collections of essays (MIKE NELSON'S MOVIE MEGACHEESE and MIKE NELSON'S MIND OVER MATTERS) as well as his work on the late, great &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.  Nelson's distinctive style is all over this book, which is most welcome.  His narrative voice is unmistakable; I could imagine some of the paragraphs coming straight from an unused skit or riff on MST3k.<br />Remember during the MST3k host segments how every secondary character was played by the same handful of actors?  There's something similar going on here, but it's more concentrated than that.  All the characters act like aspects of Mike Nelson.  There's Mike Nelson as the confused old man; Mike Nelson as the young college boys; Mike Nelson as a country yokel; Mike Nelson doing a Jesse Ventura impersonation; etc.  This, of course, isn't a bad thing, just a little confusing at times.  Mike Nelson is a funny, funny man, so anything that brings more of him into the novel can only be considered a good thing.<br />Nelson's prose style is highly amusing.  He has a wonderful knack of taking small ordinary pieces of human interaction, blowing them up to cosmic proportions, and then deflating them with a clever turn of phrase.  He's so effective at this, that I actually found it a bit distracting at first.  It seemed to me that the humorous plot was being tripped up and slowed down by the language quirks and the diversions.  After a few chapters though, I settled in and was able to adjust to Nelson's writing style.<br />The plot is entertaining, the prose is grin-inducing, the characters are hilarious and the satire is wonderful.  I get the impression that because I don't live in or near Minnesota, I may have missed a few of the celebrity skewerings.  However, there's more than enough funny material here to keep me happy.  I laughed out loud many times while reading this, which is the best judge of whether a comedy book has succeeded.	2003-11-17
US	50631983	R37H3955KHX9MG	0812503503	15771589	Oktober	Books	2	3	5	N	Y	Oktober, in an off year	I read and enjoyed Stephen Gallagher's RED, RED ROBIN, so I was looking forward to getting into his OKTOBER novel.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  RED, RED ROBIN did a much better job of placing us inside the heads and minds of its characters.  OKTOBER seemed much more interested in moving its players around the European settings, and I felt that the book was the poorer for it.<br />The story begins with an ordinary man being injected with an experimental drug.  Literally brought back from death, Jim Harper is now dealing with the strange side effects.  Along the way, he meets various characters loosely related to what happened to him as he attempts to unravel the mystery surrounding the drug and the company that created it.  He encounters various stock conspiracy scenarios, and none of them feel particularly inspired.<br />OKTOBER is nominally a thriller, but it just feels like it's going through the motions.  The book never lets us build up towards anything, as the characters are just drifting through the narrative.  There are just too many aimless story elements present.  There's a computer hacking subplot that goes nowhere.  A possible blackmail scheme just fizzles.  And the experimental drug side effects (greatly hyped by the back cover) are mere window-dressing, and, while some of the hints dropped about them are intriguing, they ultimately lead nowhere.<br />While I can't say that I liked the book as a whole, there were definitely enjoyable pieces of it.  Gallagher's prose is quite effective, and there are some passages that sparkle.  In particular, a handful of dream sequences are shockingly vivid, and reminded me of why I liked RED, RED ROBIN so much.  Unfortunately, there weren't enough of these to resurrect the book for me, yet there were enough of them for me to give Gallagher another chance.	2003-11-11

SLEEPY actually had strong female characters!  What a joy!  Not that SLEEPY is some kind of radical feminist manifesto or anything, but it was a much needed change of pace to see women characters as more than just a) items to be rescued and b) sperm-banks.  Hallelujah.)<br />I liked SLEEPY.  I didn't like it as much as I did THE LEFT-HANDED HUMMINGBIRD or SET PIECE, but it has a lot going for it all the same.  It seems to be the most straightforward of Kate Orman's first three NAs, and is much more focused on plot and story than on the intricate character explorations that were the highlights of those other two novels.  While this made the book seem a little less special, it didn't detract from what is a good, solid, entertaining piece of science fiction.<br />I liked the way the book opens.  Instead of having us first meet these Earth colonists and then going through the obligatory long introductions where the Doctor and companions are met with suspicion, locked up, escape, get locked up again, escape, and gradually gain the trust of the local rebels/leaders, etc., Orman forgoes the usual Doctor Who beginnings and launches us straight into the story.  Yes, sometimes those slow introductions can be insightful and enjoyable, but there are times when one prefers to just get on with it.  And since SLEEPY was so plot-oriented, I was happy to jump right into the middle of the action.<br />In any event, the story concerns an Earth colony, and in the spirit of those old Pertwee-era novelisations (I'm thinking specifically of THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE here), the explorers are looking to get away from the solar system and its overbearing governments/corporations.  They've settled on what appears to be a hospitable planet and have hopes of raising a large community.  Butwhat the Doctor and company discover is an unknown virus that is suddenly activating strange psychic powers in whoever becomes infected.  The community is understandably alarmed when a significant number of its membership can now read minds, levitate objects, or set things on fire just by thinking about it.<br />I mentioned that the story begins quickly.  Well, it also moves quickly.  The pace is smooth for the most part, but there also seemed to be places where it jerked ahead violently.  It had the effect of keeping me on my toes, but I also found it a bit disorientating a times.  I really had to pay attention to keep track of what was going on.<br />To be honest, I found most of the colonists to be a bit faceless.  There's a fair amount of detail concerning each of them, but I just couldn't tell them apart without flipping back to reread the relevant sections.  On the other hand, the commander of the company forces, Colonel White, was an intriguing and interesting villain.<br />I don't have a lot to say about this one really.  I enjoyed it while I was reading it, but not too much struck me in any particular way.  I think of SLEEPY as a good engaging read that isn't overly demanding.  I'm glad that most of Kate Orman's books are more involved than this one, yet this works well as a relaxing change of pace.	2003-11-09
US	50631983	R1STMSSQY159J9	0426204646	913890779	Warchild (Doctor Who: The New Adventures) (The New Doctor Who Series)	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Not a disciplined Warchild	I thought that WARHEAD was absolutely fantastic.  I was a big fan of WARLOCK.  But WARCHILD is where the Cartmel train went catastrophically off the track.  What happened?  There are a few passages that echo some of the more successful elements of Cartmel's previous two books, but those sections are few and far between.  The references to his earlier works (WARCHILD is a sequel of sorts to WARHEAD and WARLOCK, but knowledge of those shouldn't be required) are unfortunate, as they only served to remind me of much better books.<br />The story brings us back into the lives of a few characters from the aforementioned Cartmel novels.  This book begins the Psi-Powers story-arc and given the events of WARHEAD and WARCHILD, it made sense to have Cartmel write a third story featuring psychic powers.  Cartmel does a good job of reusing these plot elements without rehashing them.<br />So, what is the single biggest flaw in this book?  I think for me it was that I could never escape the feeling that I was reading a sloppy work.  We know that Cartmel is capable of writing very disciplined material, but he didn't accomplish that this time.  The jumbled mood is present in many different aspects of the novel.  For instance, the plot can only continue due to laughably outrageous coincidences and implausible actions.  Character motivations aren't terribly strong, as people do things for no reason other than the story requiring them to.  The themes and allusions that the novel is making might have actually been interesting had they not had all the subtlety of a bulldozer.<BR> <BR>Another area of sloppiness is in the use of the regular characters.  In the first two books of the War-trilogy, the Doctor is a player behind the scenes.  He has few actual appearances in the story, but when he does appear, he's a force of nature to be reckoned with.  His presence is felt on every page as his plans gradually unfold.  By contrast, in WARCHILD the Doctor spends most of his time defrosting a skinny, naked guy.  He may get more actual screen-time in this book then in any other portion of the Cartmel trilogy, but his impact on the story is a fraction of what it was in those other books.<br />I know I won't be the first person to state this, but this felt horribly like a Benny and Ace book that was hastily and clumsily altered to accommodate the change in lineup.  Roz becomes virtually indistinguishable from Ace (I imagine a simple search-and-replace was involved and then a quick addition of a few cursory &quot;the scowling black woman walked into the room&quot; sentences). And poor Chris Cwej must still have the bruises from where he was awkwardly stapled into the plot.<br />Something else that I am also not the first person to report was finding the book's portrayal of women to be somewhat... well... let's be polite and call it &quot;old-fashioned&quot;.  At first, I thought it was just me; after all, I read WARCHILD immediately after completing Neal Stephenson's CRYPTONOMICON, which has a dearth of strong women characters and a similar immature attitude towards the female of the species.  However, a quick search through Google's archives and reading other reviews revealed that I am not alone in this observation.  On the other hand, this may have been a deliberate stylistic choice -- one of the book's main themes is a load of nonsense concerning the concept of the &quot;Alpha Male&quot;.  But whatever the reason, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.  <br />WARCHILD had one or two excellent set pieces, which are horribly let down by everything that surrounds them.  I don't know the circumstances concerning the writing and publication of this novel, but it certainly reads like something that was rushed to print without the necessary time and care being put into it to ensure that it all makes sense.  Even the quality of the prose of WARCHILD seems like a step down from the heights of Cartmel's previous novels.  A huge disappointment.	2003-11-03
US	50631983	R2Z534KQIEGGR5	0060512806	555229230	Cryptonomicon	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Huge and flawed, but not hugely flawed	The size of CRYPTONOMICON varies depending on which individual printing that you get ahold of (although, presumably, they all contain the same amount of text).  Depending on the size of the margins, the typeface and the paper, the page count of your copy of CRYPTONOMICON will range from nine hundred to eleven hundred.  My own copy weighs in at nine hundred, eighteen pages.  No matter how you look at it, that's a lot of words, and a lot of reading.  And I'll say this from the onset: in addition to everything else I will mention, Neal Stephenson's CRYPTONOMICON was engrossing and absorbing.  It rarely bored me, and kept me interested for its entirety.  No mean feat, considering the length, though I certainly felt as though I had completed a marathon by the time I finally turned over the final page.<br />To reduce the book to a summary is an extremely difficult task.  As a start, we can say that the story takes place in two different time-periods, although there are separate strands running in each setting.  The first part takes place during World War II; much of it concerns the exploits of the mathematicians who broke the German codes as well as the people who tried their hardest to make sure that the Germans themselves did not figure out that the Allies had broken the encryption techniques.  The WWII sections are the book's strongpoint, with the historical details and diversions providing an excellent background.  A lot of the humor in this section works well, although some of it reads like a watered down version of CATCH-22.<BR> <BR>The second portion of the book takes place in the modern day.  It vaguely feels like it's trying to be a sort of techno-thriller.  Of course, it's difficult to describe more precisely, because it seems like it's trying to do half a dozen things at once, and it isn't quite sure what it wants to be.  Some plot points begin, are expanded upon, and then promptly vanish.  There's a lot of geek humor on display, and some portions of the plot will require quite a bit of technical knowledge.  Stephenson explains much of what the audience needs to know, but I bet that a fairly significant portion of the book will fly over the head of many readers.<br />Could the story have been told in fewer than 900+ pages?  Absolutely, but the question rather misses the point.  The plot itself is relatively minimal.  What the book does is to allow itself to go off into tangents and branches nominally related to the main subject.  Characters (or even the narrative itself) will suddenly launch into long speeches about unrelated topics to varying degrees of success.  Some of the discussions are fascinating and thought provoking.  Others are utterly self-indulgent and should have been left on the proverbial cutting room floor.  One gets the impression that the editor (or editors) were afraid suggest cuts, leaving us with a flawed work.<br />I got the inkling that Stephenson had thought of about a dozen good ideas for a book, but instead of developing them individually, he decided to throw them all into a single volume.  This gives us a mixed result.  It's decidedly fresh, unpredictable and exciting, but I also felt that he wasn't doing justice to all of his ideas.  Some threads don't have time to flourish before they are cast off, and it's a shame to see their potential flushed away.<br />The ending feels a bit rushed, which I found to be surprising, given how much time is spent setting up all the plot threads and strands.  And looking back on what I've written, I notice that I've probably spent too much time going over the book's flaws, so I feel the need to point out that there is a lot of great stuff contained between these covers.  A lot of the little passages lead to fascinating discussions.  Had this been a more disciplined work, it would probably have been absolutely amazing.  As it currently stands, however, it is a flawed work, albeit an interesting one.	2003-10-27
US	50631983	ROLZ3AQMQMOET	0426204638	962091857	Just War (The New Doctor Who Adventures) (The New Doctor Who Series)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Love and War	Doctor Who had, of course, already produced stories set during WWII, but JUST WAR would prove to be something different.  While Nazis had appeared in TIMEWYRM: EXODUS, they were cartoonish, and one could easily imagine each and every one of them being played by Bernie Kopell (ah, split screening technology).  But JUST WAR takes its central premise seriously, and the payoff is incredible.  Doctor Who has dealt with similar themes before (usually in allegory), but rarely so effectively, and never in such stark terms.<br />World War II is raging through Europe.  The Nazis are making enormous technical advances.  Germany occupies British soil.  But the back cover informs us that this is not a parallel universe story, nor is there any indication of alien interference.  (In fact, JUST WAR would appear to be a rare example of a purely historical story in the New Adventures.)  The Doctor and company must deal with the menace on its own terms.  As is typical in the books of this era, each of the regulars has his/her own part in the Doctor's grand scheme to play.  The mission here is comparatively easy: find out what is going on.<br />Although the plot is very cleverly constructed, whenever I think back upon the story, I think of it as more of a collection of excellent set pieces held together by an adequate storyline (more on this later).  Many of those set pieces involve characters giving lengthy speeches about Nazism, racial purity, or warfare.  These speeches, while stagy in execution, are genuinely chilling.<br />I mentioned the plot as being adequate, and I should elaborate on that.  The storyline does feels a little awkward at times.  But I hasten to add that overall it contains a lot of surprises and some genuinely effective material.  Any minor problems certain don't harm the book, but it does give it the feel of a book more reliant on themes and characters than on plot and events.  And there's nothing wrong with that. <br />JUST WAR is notable by both what it says,and by what it leaves unsaid.  Despite the long passages dealing with such topics, the words \\"Dalek\\" and \\"Hitler\\" never appear, and the book is stronger for its subtleties.  I wish I could say the same for the passages dealing with the racism faced by Roz in 1940s Britain.  Yes, such attitudes are realistic for that time and place, but they feel slightly overdone.  A very similar thing was executed better in Paul Leonard's TOY SOLDIERS, and JUST WAR just feels like it's rehashing the same ground without bringing anything new to the table.  Fortunately, for every example of that, there is something shockingly effective to counter it.  The scene of Roz contemplating her own cultural heritage is that kind of sequence that propels the book towards its lofty reputation.<br />JUST WAR was Lance Parkin's first New Adventure, but you wouldn't know that from the maturity of his writing and the confident way he handles the regular characters.  I would happily hold up JUST WAR as example of what Doctor Who does best.  It deals with serious themes, while putting a human face on horrific suffering.  It also never comes across as being unbearably grim despite the topics that Parkin is dealing with.	2003-10-13
US	50631983	R16IU9CMALFUYV	042620459X	221622911	Shakedown (Doctor Who: The New Adventures) (The New Doctor Who Series)	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Shake it, Uncle Terry!	I like Terrance Dicks' prose.  I can't help it; I grew up reading Terrance Dicks novelisations.  My Target collection and I were inseparable.  I took those books to school; I took them on holiday with me; if I had been a member of the child slave trade, you can be sure that I would have brought a grubby copy of INFERNO down the salt mines with me.  <br />Good heavens, I don't think I meant to say exactly all that.  Yet, I must point out that I am predisposed towards liking Terrance Dicks books.  It can't be helped; it's now hardwired into my brain.  But it's not something I'm ashamed about, even now, as the world of original Doctor Who novels has moved beyond Uncle Terry's monthly churn-out.  For every Terry failure, there's a wonderful Terry success.  For every regurgitated ENDGAME, there's a fantastic TIMEWYRM: EXODUS.  For every boring Benny chapter in BLOOD HARVEST, there's a fun Chicago chapter in, er, BLOOD HARVEST.  Well, you get the idea.  In any case, I found SHAKEDOWN to be very much in the style of previous Terrance Dicks books (which is what everyone said about every Terrance Dicks book, except, of course, for the first one).  And what I mean by that is that it combines the fun and adventure of a solid, uncomplicated story with a breezy, entertaining style.<br />Well, before I get utterly carried away (quiet, you), I should at least make an attempt at describing this novel.  It's a Sontaran/Rutan story.  It separates the Doctor and companions in true Terry-style, and places them each in their own subplot.  Chris and Roz are on the trail of a Rutan spy, tracking it from planet to planet, as it endeavors to stay one step ahead while on a secret mission of its own.  Benny is dropped off on a university world, where her task is to study the history of the Sontaran/Rutan War.  The Doctor's subplot involves him not being in the story very much, but don't mind about that because this is a Dicks novel and it moves too fast for anyone to notice or care about that.<br />As the introduction, back cover, inside pages, back page advertisement and photo inserts (including a wonderful shot right up Michael Wisher's nose -- thanks, lads) tell us, this is partially the novelisation of a direct-to-video story written by (who else?) Terrance Dicks.  So, Terrance Dicks is novelizing a script by Terrance Dicks; did the 70s never end?  Truthfully, the novelisation only takes up about sixty pages in the middle, and doesn't have a huge impact on the rest of the book (although a handful of characters do filter through).  The sections before and after the novelisation are quite entertaining -- much more so than the novelisation itself.  <br />Terrance Dicks has written so many adaptations of Doctor Who and related stories that I imagine that he must be able to do them in his sleep by now (and he probably does -- poor Mrs. Uncle Terry).  But strangely enough, it's the novelisation portion of this book that drags the most.  The middle sixty or so pages add absolutely nothing to the rest.  Nothing, zilch, nada.   It's padding, and it's not even interesting padding.  The solution to the Sontaran's problem is blindingly obvious, yet they never solve it, because the story can't let them solve it.  It's formulaic and boring; it utterly fails to fill me with the desire to see the original straight-to-video production.  There are also two strange places where the middle section makes an oblique and Benny Adventures-like reference to the Doctor.  Possibly this came from the original screenplay that had to sidestep various copyrights, but the jokes seem very much out of place inside what is now a genuine Doctor Who story.<br />It's always easy to tell when Dicks is getting bored by certain parts of the story.  He seems to have enjoyed writing the Mega City portions (very similar to the Chicago sequences in BLOOD HARVEST).  The Shakedown novelisation parts aren't given nearly the same amount of care, and, as a result, they tend to fall rather on the flat side.  A few other portions are also breezed over, as if Dicks knew they were needed in order for the plot to advance, but simply couldn't be bothered fleshing them out.  I can easily imagine the following occurring during a typical novel writing session: \\"Ah, yes, now for chapter seven.  Hmmmmm, this part of the outline isn't going to be any fun to write.  Really dull, in fact.  Oh, I know.  I'll just highlight these bits of the outline.  Yeah, click on 'cut'.  Now to open the novel document.  Yes, I click on 'paste' now.  Yes.  Excellent.  Well, that was an easy chapter to write.  Now, what have I got cooked up in eight?\\"<br />The above paragraph may sound like a criticism, but it isn't.  Terrance Dicks knows what makes a boring section, and (in SHAKEDOWN at least) he's quite skillful at happily skipping over the boring (but necessary) sections in order to get back to the fun and games.  Hooray!<br />From a technical standpoint, the book seems lazy and almost amateurish.  There are pieces that are sloppy and not having been fully thought through.  Benny disappears for just about a hundred pages (the book is only two hundred thirty three pages long) because Dicks can't figure out what to do with her.  But, hey, it's a hell of a lot of fun, so who cares about those minor details?  I wouldn't want to read a hundred of these books, but once in a while this sort of adventure is very appealing.	2003-10-05
US	50631983	R2RTLBT0HDR10W	030680607X	919072103	The Groucho Letters: Letters from and to Groucho Marx	Books	4	4	7	N	Y	Not The Screwtape Letters	The biggest compliment I can give this collection is that reading it made me wish I wrote more letters and had more celebrities among my circle of potential letter-receivers.  Of course, inherent laziness being what it is (and the fact that I have so far been frustrated in all such attempts to gain the favor of our nation's collection of celebrities), I'll have to be content reading Groucho's correspondence.  And, as alternatives go, it's not bad at all.<br />The book is divided into ten sections: &quot;Movie Business&quot;, &quot;Private Life&quot;,  &quot;Touching On Television&quot;, &quot;Groucho and Other Men of Letters&quot;, &quot;Grouchy&quot;, &quot;Broadway and Hollywood&quot;, &quot;For Publication&quot;, &quot;Friends Abroad&quot;, &quot;The Faintly Political Scene&quot;, and &quot;Short Shrift&quot;.  Of course, there's quite a lot of overlap involved; Groucho had a tendency to ramble, so there isn't a simple way to categorize each individual letter.  <br />There are many highlights and surprises.  Groucho's communications with the Warner Brother's legal division over the title &quot;A Night In Casablanca&quot; is probably one of the better known exchanges in Hollywood, and deservedly so as it's utterly hilarious.  (In short, Warner Brothers claimed that the title violated their copyrights; Marx replies with typical nonsense and wit, claiming, among other things, to have a prior claim on the word &quot;Brothers&quot;.)  In a letter that I found surprising, Groucho chides the President of the Chrysler Corporation, suggesting that the car company paying more attention to safety concerns would be in everyone's interests as well as saving thousands of lives a year.  Groucho Marx as a precursor to Ralph Nader?  Who would have guessed it?<br />Groucho's public persona was that of a sarcastic and wisecracking character.  Naturally, that personality comes through in his letters.  A few passages do put some balance on that.  While about 90% of the mentions of his daughter are jokes about her annoying him and absorbing his money in vast quantities, there remains a slight 10% where an almost sweet nature comes through.  In a similar vein, he writes a heartfelt letter to Jerry Lewis (of all people), imploring him to take a good hard look at whether he really wants to split with his comedy partner, Dean Martin.  To Groucho's credit, he writes a follow-up letter a few years later apologizing for his earlier advice.<br />It's hard to describe the bulk of these letters without simply summarizing them, so I will stop doing so, and will confine myself to simply recommending the book.  Groucho corresponded with a wild variety of people in his day, and some of the biggest laughs come for people you wouldn't expect to be quite so witty.	2003-10-04
US	50631983	R2KJOOYY83UR0V	0563538694	61933614	The Domino Effect (Doctor Who)	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Reject This Effect	It has been quite a while since I've read a book that makes this many little mistakes.  Sure, it does a few things right, and there are also a couple of major blunders.  But what eventually killed the story for me was the number of times I would be reading a short portion, roll my eyes, and utter, &quot;Oh, come on!&quot;  At the outline stage, THE DOMINO EFFECT could only have been an adequate, mediocre adventure.  But in execution, this book feels like death by a thousand cuts.  I should have known right off the bat that this would be a poor one.  The back cover gives us: &quot;[the Doctor's] efforts are hampered by crippling chest pains.&quot;  Our brave, fearless hero is facing the dastardly powers of crippling chest pains?  Help!  What next?  Fitz stuck in the TARDIS with a hangover and Anji battling a ferocious Bad Hair Day?<BR> <BR>I'll get the positive stuff out of the way first.  The pacing is quite good.  I never felt bogged down or bored.  This is an important consideration, since if the book had not been as swift, it would have turned from being merely bad into being totally excruciating.  Of course, the downside for this sort of pace in this sort of book is that the narrative jumps merrily from mistake to blunder to miscue.<br />The biggest &quot;little&quot; mistake that the author makes is something that I find particularly annoying.  It's when characters are required to do really stupid things in order for the plot to advance.  This is lazy enough when it happens to a character who exists only within the confines of the story.  But it's unforgivable when it happens to a regular, continuing character.<br />Anji has, through the EDAs so far, been portrayed as an intelligent and capable woman.  Why is she so slow to realize that something is wrong with this United Kingdom?  Why do all the anachronisms and inconsistencies fail to clue her in?  Why is she acting so dumb?  The fact that history is in a state of flux has been known since TIME ZERO.  Even ifpart of the audience came to this book fresh, this is listed on the back cover.  So, before the book has even begun, the reader already knows that this is not the &quot;real&quot; Earth and must wait for the character to catch up.  Seriously, how can Anji not pick up on any of the obvious clues?  Okay, I'm not expecting her to nip outside and check the back cover of the current book (at least, not in a novel not written by Steve Lyons), but she at least lived through the end of TIME ZERO, and the clues she's given are blindingly obvious.  Each time an abnormality presented itself to her, I would say to myself, &quot;Ah, okay, finally she'll figure it out now and we can move on to something else&quot; -- only to have her obliviously continue on her way.  Argh!<br />I can't think of another book that I can see falling apart and falling out of control quite like this one.  There are so many awkward passages that it gives the impression of being written in a single weekend.  One can just imagine the author racing through to meet the deadline, clumsily throwing shallow, one-dimensional characters and implausible plot-points down on the page simply to have something to hand in.  (Not to suggest that this is what actually happened -- that's simply how it felt to this reader.)  The book never seems to know what it is doing.  For example, the first thirty pages are told in a combination of flashbacks, and a straightforward, third person narrative voice.  I actually liked the story being told in this way; it kept things interesting.  But the journal extracts end within the first fifty pages, and the book continues normally.  Why the switch?  Why were they there in the first place?  I enjoyed the first-person passages when I was reading them, but when they vanished without replacement, they retroactively came across as merely a pointless gimmick.  Authors pick their narrative voice with reason, but I couldn't figure out what point this served in this novel.<br />Nowhere is the rushed nature of the book more evident than at its conclusion.  It's actually quite easy for me to discuss without providing spoilers because I simply didn't understand enough to describe in detail.  I read the conclusion.  I reread selected portions.  I then read some sections a third time.  It still didn't make any sense.  This conclusion makes less sense the more one thinks about it.  The book tells me that the uberstory situation is now worse than it was before, but I can't for the life of me figure out why.  It's bad enough that the ending consists almost entirely of technobabble, but I really object to it consisting almost entirely of incomprehensible technobabble.  Even if it had made sense (and I concede the possibility that there exists a simple explanation that I am simply too dimwitted to understand), it's terribly unfair to end a book like this with a solid chapter of scientific-sounding nonsense.<br />I was quite disappointed with this book.  David Bishop's WHO KILLED KENNEDY? was massively entertaining, engrossing, and utterly unforgettable -- in other words, the complete opposite of THE DOMINO EFFECT.  Oh, and can anyone explain to me what the &quot;domino effect&quot; is as far as what it has to do with this story?  Anji mentioned it in passing, but what it actually means here remains a mystery to me.  Outside of the confines of this story, I would have said that it has something to do with one event in history having effects and repercussions long after the event has completed.  Yet, that doesn't seem to have anything to do with this story, which is more a series of constant interference trying to produce one single circumstance.	2003-09-23
US	50631983	R34FOTXCLENEJG	042620512X	234030327	Down (The New Adventures Series)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Down To Earth	I'm going to do my best to review DOWN without making it sound much more pretentious than it is.  This is made complicated by the fact that the book is indeed pretentious -- at least a little.  But any description (and I can feel mine heading in that direction despite my best efforts) is bound to emphasize the high concepts being thrown around here.  But it should be noted that despite everything else that is present, DOWN also contains a lot of fun adventure stuff.  <br />I think the best way to describe DOWN is to say that it is very much a reaction to (and against) the events of THE ALSO PEOPLE, in the same way that Lawrence Miles has reacted against other Doctor Who creations (of course, you don't need to have read THE ALSO PEOPLE to enjoy this one, as everything you need to know is included).  I find that I generally prefer Lawrence Miles' writing when he's playing with and subverting other people's ideas rather than trying to create something truly original.  He usually seems to come up with angles and viewpoints that are skewed, stunningly creative but perfectly in keeping with the original.  He does not disappoint here.<br />THE ALSO PEOPLE gave us a highly advanced People (they were referred to as &quot;people&quot; in the original, but become &quot;People&quot; here) who live on the inside of a massive Dyson's Sphere/Shell.  They are a peaceful people, existing in an idyllic paradise, and ruled by a stupendously advanced computer that is jokingly referred to as &quot;God&quot;.  In DOWN, Professor Bernice Summerfield and two students are investigating a planet called Tyler's Folly.  The back cover tells us that the planet is hollow, with some sort of creatures living on the inside.  While God kept the Worldsphere in a state of serenity, the apparent controller in Tyler's Folly does not have the same benevolent motivation.  Also included in the story are two representatives from the People: a student of psychotics, and a psychotic Person.<br />The story istold as flashbacks.  The inhabitants of the outside surface of Tyler's Folly find Benny in a prohibited area; they throw her in jail, suspected of attempted looting.  The story is told as part of her questioning by the authorities.  Sharp-eyed readers may note some apparent inconsistencies, but these are brilliantly covered by the end.  In fact, parts of the narrative are an intriguing look at parts of Benny's character, the ramifications of which I never really quite thought of before.<BR> <BR>The book does have a few flaws.  As a reaction against the Worldsphere, Tyler's Folly falls strangely flat.  Miles tells us about the comparison, but what we see doesn't really go far enough to drive this home.  This has the effect of making the middle of the book drag a bit.<BR> <BR>And as I look up at what I have already written, I see that I have done exactly what I was trying not to do.  Yes, DOWN is a book concealing huge ideas, but those ideas occupy a surprisingly small portion of the page-count.  Most of the pages are involved in a good old-fashioned adventure story, where Benny and her two students (What's this?  Original and interesting characters in a Lawrence Miles novel?) descend into the Tyler's Folly underworld on the trail of a long-missing archeologist.  All the adventure stuff is merely setting up a lot of the revelations at the end.  Fortunately, the adventure is an engaging one, although it does sputter a little and could have been a bit more exciting.<br />DOWN isn't perfect, and it doesn't do all the stuff that Miles is attempting; it still makes for fascinating reading.  It takes some pieces of the Benny/Doctor Who universe (from the major to the minor) and cleverly rearranges them and adds to them in unexpected ways.  But beyond that, the adventure is still a fun one, and most of the comedy pieces work.	2003-09-22

There is so much about THE ALSO PEOPLE that is just pleasant.  This was a book billed as the Doctor and his companions simply going on holiday, and it actually delivers on that premise.  It's relaxing, understated and utterly absorbing.  Its simplicity is its greatest strength.  By having a slow-moving plot, we really get to grips with the details, and the details are what make this such an enjoyable read.<br />Although this is one of the largest settings ever seen in a Doctor Who story, the stakes feel surprisingly small.  There is just one unexplained murder to solve, and one ethical dilemma, both of which don't even appear until we're well into the flow.  The rest of the time is spent in a combination of world-building and character exploration.  It's hard to believe that the same book can feel both relaxing and riveting, but Aaronovitch manages it.  The plot is extremely slight, yet the story never feels padded.  The book seems to be exactly the right length for the storyline, and although there aren't huge plot twists and revelations every twenty pages, that's wonderful, because that isn't what this book is going for.  The book focuses on the small things, and lets the big things take care of themselves.  And, really, isn't that what Doctor Who itself has always been about in one form or another?<br />Every character is gorgeously portrayed, including, surprisingly, the Doctor.  Yes, there are a greater-than-average number of scenes told from the Doctor's point of view, and they're fantastic (of course, the average itself is only slightly above zero).  I have a sneaking suspicion that Ben Aaronovitch counts among his friends a certain centuries old, world-weary Time Lord and that he somehow sweet-talked that fellow into ghostwriting these sections of the book for him.  Shame on Ben Aaronovitch.  Of course, he also nails every other character perfectly, so I can deduce that he's also buddies with cops hailing from the far future, a grumpy drunken archeologist, and incredibly powerful aliens living inside a Dyson Sphere.  Oh yeah, and God.  Lucky Aaronovitch; I bet his dinner parties are a laugh.<br />Speaking of the Dyson Sphere (if you didn't already know: a Dyson Sphere as a scientific proposal based upon the idea of building a huge shell around a stable star, with people living on the inside walls), it is an incredible achievement that the author was able to make this as believable a concept as it turned out.  We know from the back cover that the people of the Worldsphere are an extremely advanced civilization with incredible powers (we're told that they have a non-aggression pact with the Time Lords).  All too often, this only results in the initial concept being abandoned when the author needs to have the superior creatures outsmarted by the mere mortal protagonists.  But not here.  Here, Aaronovitch doesn't let up on his premise in the slightest.  The result is a civilization that sparkles and jumps right off the page.  Is this because the core ideas were borrowed from another source?  Possibly, though I haven't read any of Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, so I don't really have an opinion on that.  The main point is that wherever the ideas come from, they work extremely well here, and they're treated intelligently.<br />But huge world-building aside, it's the little things that the book does that are the reason it's so popular.  The prose is sharp and wonderful.  The novel is deceptively simple; it's only when I go back and rethink certain portions that I realize quite how clever Aaronovitch was in the construction of the themes.  The murder subplot, the treatment of Chris and Roz by the Worldsphere people, and the sections with Kadiatu all revolve around the same topics, and it's a blast working out how everything fits together.  I think there are one or two points of the plot that are sacrificed to make the themes succeed properly, but, in context, it worked.<br />For anyone who thinks that the NAs were too gritty, too dark, too angsty, or just plain &quot;not Doctor Who&quot;, THE ALSO PEOPLE should be required reading.  It deals with deep and thoughtful issues, but it does so in an amazingly enjoyable story that contains as many great jokes as it does introspective passages.  There's much to cherish in this one.  From the Doctor sadly wondering if he couldn't just be a street entertainer, to the sentient, talking parachute, to the scene of Cwej accidentally dumping several gallons of water onto a sleeping Doctor's head, there are just too many great scenes in the book to dryly list off in a review such as this.  Just snag yourself a copy and read it immediately.

US	50631983	R2I80JX0A8QELG	0060392452	194848581	Stupid White Men ...And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation!	Books	4	17	21	N	N	Had enough of Stupid White Men?	When it comes to a choice between reading a well researched, reasonably argued political work, and reading an angry rant, I'll be more likely to reader the former.  And STUPID WHITE MEN is definitely closer to the latter (as should be obvious from both the title and the cover of this tome).  But, all the same, I really enjoyed reading this.  While Michael Moore has done his research, documented his sources and thrown in some statistics when necessary, the book still feels like something you'd hear being screamed by the local lunatic on the street corner holding a sign saying, \\"The end is nigh!\\"  Yet, if you're in the right mood for that sort of thing, then this is absolutely wonderful.<br />Yes, I agree with a lot (though certainly not all) of what Moore rants about in this book.  And this is the key, because if you don't already agree with him, then there is no way that his abrasive style is going to convince any doubters.  He's occasionally rude, frequently arrogant, and has absolutely no time for anyone who disagrees with him.  Sure, he's preaching to the converted, but, hey, sometimes that's just what the choir wants.<br />It's an oddly timed book.  It's pre-9/11 which means that he avoids that rather large topic.  But it's also attacking Bush even though Bush hadn't been in office quite long enough to really do the sort of things that Moore hates.  To make up for this, he spends a significant amount of time criticizing the Clinton/Gore administration for the large steps to the right that team made during their eight year reign.  He also spends a lot of pages abusing the Republicans (and some Democrats) in Congress for all the lousy things they've been doing recently.<br />The election fiasco of 2000 is heavily dealt with, as one would expect from a book written the following year.  Although I knew virtually all the facts that Moore dragged out, it was a great reminder of how bizarre the whole thing was.  The chapter dealing with what happened in Florida shouldbe required reading for anyone who thinks that democracy is simple or safe.<br />If you're a left-winger looking for something you can cheer or nod along with, then ANGRY WHITE MEN is a great place to start.  However, if you're looking for something to convince your friends, family, and co-workers that bad things are happening in the USA, I'd recommend something a little more reasoned and researched (Ralph Nader's CRASHING THE PARTY should be excellent for this).  The short answer is that if you think you'll love this book, then you probably will; it delivers exactly what it promises.	2003-09-15
US	50631983	RKV4E792L0HVL	067973225X	161451712	As I Lay Dying: The Corrected Text	Books	3	5	12	N	N	As I Lay Pondering	AS I LAY DYING is only the second William Faulkner novel that I've read and, all things considered, I much preferred ABSALOM, ABSALOM.  Of course, that was a brilliant and intricately constructed tale, so AS I LAY DYING had its work cut out for it if it was going to impress me in the same way.  While I did appreciate a lot of what was going on here, I simply couldn't get into the story the way I had for the other book.<br />The storyline is very simple, and only requires a short summary.  Addie Bundren is an old southern woman, and at the very beginning of the novel, she dies.  So her family goes on a long journey to bury her in her hometown, a place she insisted on, rather than being laid to rest in the local cemetery.  Their travels are, of course, fraught with peril.  Bridges have been washed away, food is scarce, and multiple other problems appear to impede their progress.  The obstacles are just a way of getting the characters to do or say things, and the characters are where I was most impressed and most disappointed by this book.<br />There are many people here, both within and outside the Bundren family.  The inhabitants of Faulkner's fictitious southern county enter to make wry and confused observations while the Bundrens move from place to place.  The Bundrens all have different reactions to the death of the mother, and this is pretty much where the meat of the story is based.  But not all of the narratives worked for me.  Many of them are played for laughs, but not all of them are funny.  Faulkner has a very dark sense of humor on display here, which worked well in several portions, but felt a bit stale in others.<br />The main problem I felt was that there didn't seem to be room for all of the Bundrens in the story.  Consequently, not all of them appeared as distinct voices and I had difficulty telling them apart.  They were interesting, but just not quite strong enough to carry the whole novel by themselves.  A few of the characters are just hanging around for great lengths of it, saying and doing little.  There's a character that, at the end, suddenly gets this heartbreaking subplot of her own.  But it was so unexpected and distasteful, that I just couldn't really appreciate it, as moving and well written as it was.<br />Ultimately, while I found this to be a relatively easy Faulkner work to read (comparatively), I cannot say that I found it to be particularly rewarding.  Taken by itself, there's little that I found actually wrong with the book.  It does a good job of balancing the humor and the drama.  The multiple-narrative structure allows some interesting things to be done with point-of-view.  But at the end of the day, I was simply disappointed not to be reading something as great as ABSALOM, ABSALOM.	2003-09-08
US	50631983	RTR5QS4VF0YMK	0426204549	812846261	Head Games (Doctor Who, the New Adventures)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	The Death of Dr Who	HEAD GAMES features Steve Lyons returning again to the ideas Peter Ling created in the television serial, THE MIND ROBBER.  The main difference here is that instead of people being trapped inside the Land of Fiction, the encroachment is going in the opposite direction.  The previous Master (Jason) is venturing outside the Land, but still retains its fictional powers.  And one of his first actions is to create a hero to travel with.   He produces a mysterious scientist/time-traveler.  Someone who fights monsters and rights wrongs.  Someone by the name of &quot;Dr. Who&quot;.<br />Despite the heavy moralizing and angsty emotional stuff, there's a lot of fun material here.  The comparisons between Dr. Who and our own Doctor are amusing and only occasionally overbearing.  One of the main themes that the book touches on is the shift in personality that the Seventh Doctor undertook when he: (a) first changed companions, and (b) switched mediums, going from television to book form.  Much of this comparison takes place through the eyes of Mel, the squeaky-clean and utterly boring first companion of the Seventh Doctor.  Her characterization is very much based on the stories that she appeared in and it's hysterical to see her reaction to the darker and ambiguous universe that the Seventh Doctor now finds himself dwelling in.<br />There's an unfortunately large part of the adventure that is so clichéd and stereotypical that I wondered if Lyon wasn't making some grand statement about formulaic stories.  Actually, given the rest of the book's contents, this almost certainly is a statement of some sort, but that doesn't excuse it from being a mostly uninteresting waste of time.  Rebels running up and down corridors.  Fanatical religious rulers misleading a population.  A mysterious artifact that gives life to a whole planet.  A boring conflict between humanoids and reptile-aliens.  Just thinking about it makes my eyes start to close.  Lyons' prose is decent enough here to alleviate much of the pain, but it certainly isn't enough to breathe life into these sections.<br />Despite the cover featuring an ugly question-mark pullover and an ACME weapon waved at a Bonnie Langford publicity photo, there's also quite a lot of seriousness going on here.  The Doctor faces both his past and his possible future in the forms of the Sixth Doctor and the Valeyard.  There's a large decision affecting the lives of lots of (admittedly boring) people.  HEAD GAMES is playing many games at once, and manages to win more than it loses, but only barely.  The Doctor is at his darkest, yet this aspect of his personality seems very contrived here.<br />In fact, a lot of the angst is handled awkwardly.  While Mel's reaction to the difference in tone is entirely believable (the universes in stories like TIME AND THE RANI and DELTA AND THE BANNERMEN have a completely different flavor from what we would see in later, darker adventures), her reaction to the change in the Doctor seems much more over the top.  If Mel had stuck around for one extra story, would she have freaked out at the end of REMEMBRANCE OF THE DALEKS?  And if so, why should we care?  We all noticed the Doctor upping his game as he settled into his seventh persona, but was there anyone out there who hadn't figured that out already and needed it pointed out in a novel?  Granted, Mel's behavior here could been seen as being consistent with her TV character, but if something was annoying on-screen, why go through pains to recreate it?  While it was fun to laugh at her exaggerated reactions, I'm just not sure that the comparisons were quite as clever as Lyons thought they were.<br />Although I'm spending a good deal of time talking about the negative points, there were many set pieces and individual scenes that I really enjoyed.  The sequence of the Doctor stuck on a train while the adventure slowly falls out of his control is something that I remember vividly from my first reading, many years ago.  The partsdealing with the Land of Fiction's creations are for the most part handled well, and there are one or two moments that put a shiver down my spine.  The Doctor and company's battle of wits against Dr Who and Jason is a fun diversion.<br />I did enjoy HEAD GAMES overall, but there were major portions of it that I simply wasn't interested in.  The bad sections weren't enough to actively turn me off, although I found some places to be a tough struggle to get through.  In a book that's doing lots of things at once, there's always something different just around the next page, and, fortunately, there was just enough good stuff to pull me through.  As controversial as the Valeyard/Sixth Doctor material turned out to be, I found myself quite interested in these sections (especially the hints that would be explored later in Kate Orman's THE ROOM WITH NO DOORS), but I'm just not sure what they had to do with anything else.	2003-09-03
US	50631983	R2L6JLWQHV8EF	0060188219	595845379	Ask Me Again Tomorrow: A Life in Progress	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A Memoir In Progress	I'll admit that I haven't seen very many of the films that Olympia Dukakis has performed in.  If I hadn't received a complimentary copy of this book from HarperCollins (there's my interests declared), I would probably not even have thought about picking up this volume.  But pick it up I did, although I was worried for a bit.  The quotes on the back cover were ominous: most of them seemed to be compliments from her Hollywood friends explaining how wonderful she was, but paying only lip-service to the book itself.  The introduction and prologue are similarly worrying in that Dukakis repeated states that she didn't want to write an autobiography and that she doesn't really know who she is from day to day (hence the title of the book).  But fortunately, while this wasn't the best celebrity memoir I've read, it's certainly entertaining enough.<br />The memoir begins with Dukakis recalling her Academy Award nomination (and win) for her portrayal of Rose Castorini in &quot;Moonstruck&quot;.  After covering this period of her life, she jumps back to her early childhood and spends a lot of time dealing with what it meant to be a first generation Greek-American.  She details some of her early acting work, although much of it has a vaguely superficial feel to it.  Towards the end of the book, the sections dealing with her more recent thoughts, she outlines her religious views, which (and I'm not quite sure I picked up on all the details) seem to revolve around the idea of a female goddess.  Her religious thoughts and meditations obviously mean a great deal to her, although I'm not sure she quite conveyed why they have such a huge impact on her.  She merely tells us how important these things are to her and asserts their relevance repeatedly, but we don't really get to see the impact for ourselves.<br />Dukakis has a love for the theatre, and most of her book discusses various roles she's played both on and off stage.  Helping to run a local theatre gives her a unique perspective on the business and the art, so it makes for quite interesting reading when she discusses how difficult it was for them to make ends meet.  She keeps coming back to her theatre, time and time again, and her enthusiasm for her subject is contagious.<br />The one thing that struck me was that Dukakis didn't quite seem to know how personal she wanted to be.  She included some very intimate details, but provided almost no elaboration or context.  She mentions a couple of suicide attempts in her early adulthood, but doesn't really explain what brought this depression on other than a few family-related stresses.  She discusses having an open marriage, and then closes the subject after a couple of paragraphs.  Most stories or thoughts of this nature tend to have their beginning, middle and end all take place within the same page, and then are never discussed again.  I honestly do not blame her for not wishing to delve too deeply into what are obviously painful or personal subjects, but I do wonder why she wanted to include them in the first place.<br />This is a fairly slender book.  It clocks in at just under two hundred pages, and has suspiciously wide margins.  This makes it a fairly quick read for anyone interested in what Olympia Dukakis has to say.  Dukakis has an unfortunate habit of telling rather than showing, and it contributes to the feeling that we have more a collection of facts here than a warm, human story.  Still, I can't complain too much; I knew nothing about her when I began this book, but the writing style kept me reading the whole way through.  She seems like a fascinating person underneath it all, but we never really feel as though she has taken the reader into her confidence.	2003-08-26

Even when it's a work that you haven't read before, there are always a few touchstones to make any story seem familiar.  With almost any other author, this would be a criticism, but this isn't the case for Asimov.  His body of work often overlapped, but he was talented enough never to make his stories seem repetitive.<br />THE CAVES OF STEEL almost feels like two different kinds of stories in one.  In one sense, Asimov constructed a mystery novel within the trappings and conventions of the science-fiction genre.  But he's also very interested in world-building.  He goes to great lengths to describe what life will be like in his future.  I was on a train from Connecticut to Maryland, and I was quite amused at passing through geographical locations that Asimov had futurized.  New York becomes a gigantic enclosed City, and Asimov takes great care to describe what the layout will look like and what the transportation methods will be.  New Jersey becomes a gigantic yeast farm, and I'll let readers of this review make their own New Jersey jokes at this time.<br />The main plot focuses on an unexplained murder, and Earth detective Lije Baley has been teamed with R. Daneel Olivaw, with the &quot;R&quot; standing for &quot;Robot&quot;.  Not only are anti-robot feelings running high on Earth, but there is also a lot of animosity between Earth and the colonies.  So, the murder of an important &quot;Spacer&quot; attracts enough attention that the forces of both sides are brought together to discover the truth.<br />Creating fully fleshed out characters was not always Asimov's strongpoint, and many of the secondary people feel fairly flat.  Fortunately, the two main detectives have been thought though fairly well.  Of course, since one half of the team is robotic, Asimov was making things easier on himself since he did seem to enjoy creating robots as much as he enjoyed creating human characters.  But the interplaybetween the Earther and the robot are just as good as anything Asimov wrote in I, ROBOT, or indeed, anything of his that I've read.<br />I read Asimov's final autobiography (he wrote three volumes over the years) a couple of years ago, and it's fascinating to see how much of himself he put in his stories.  Asimov famously hated leaving his apartment, and was apparently uneasy about being in wide-open spaces.  So it's not surprising to see that in the future of THE CAVES OF STEEL, mankind is overwhelmingly agoraphobic.  When a robotics scientist is transported in to the story and gives a short lecture about how he hates flying, we know that this is Asimov himself expressing one of his own personality quirks.  Little asides and pieces of dialog further this impression.  When Baley delivers a speech about an Old Testament King, the tone is almost identical to that of some of Asimov's essays that deal with Biblical subjects.<br />Mystery and science fiction were the two fictional genres that I feel Asimov was the most successful at.  Here, he combines these into one utterly engrossing story.  The plot is a lot of fun, and so is the world-building that Asimov undertakes.  But I think what I remember most about the book is the partnership of the two main characters.  Having robots and humans intermingle is something that Asimov did quite a lot of in his novels and short stories, but I think the pairing in this book is probably one of his most successful.  I already own the sequel to this book, THE NAKED SUN (yet another in my overflowing and increasing too-read pile), and I am already looking forward to being reunited with these two characters.	2003-08-11
US	50631983	R2NSTQZJJH8LPN	0345386442	127417629	Red, Red Robin	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	When the Red, Red Robin goes kill kill killing along	I'll state right off the bat that the reason I bought and read this book was because the author had penned one of my favorite Doctor Who serials and I wanted to see if he was as apt at novel-writing as he was at script-writing (I should note that he also wrote a rather mediocre Doctor Who serial, but we won't talk about that now).  I was quite impressed by this book, and it fulfilled my expectations.  I'm not a regular reader of this genre, but I found this particular example to be amazingly captivating.<br />While reading the opening chapters of RED, RED ROBIN, my mind quickly went over the possible outcomes for the story, and I quickly began to predict how the book would unfold.  It turns out that my initial prediction was correct in all but one aspect.  The scenario that I had envisioned for the whole book ended at about page 75, and from there the plot kept making clever leaps and turns, defying my ability to guess which direction it would go.  Eventually, I stopped making predictions and just enjoyed the thrill ride that it offered.<br />\\"Psychological thriller\\" is, I believe the term they use to describe this sort of book, and it's a genre that I'll admit to some inexperience with.  But if they're all as good as this one is, I should have some great reading ahead of me.  I went into this book having not read so much as a single plot summary of the novel, so I was taken completely by surprise at every twist and turn.  Therefore, I will not describe more than the very initial setup.  All you should know is that this book starts off with two people: a woman, and a man she hires from an (legitimate) escort service.  What this scenario turns into should not be hard to guess, but how it happens, and what happens beyond that are utterly surprising, and completely mesmerizing. <br />A book of this kind lives or dies depending on how interesting the protagonists are to the reader.  The audience doesn't necessarily have to like or dislike them; they just have to want tokeep reading about them.  The characters of RED, RED ROBIN are fascinating creations.  They're given huge amounts of background detail.  Their actions are always understandable and consistent.  And one of them even gets childhood flashback sequences that are quite creepy and impressive.  Gallagher does all this without sacrificing the breakneck speed of his plot.<br />One thing that I quite enjoyed was the way that the British author included many different forms of American life.  I can almost imagine him over here doing research and being inspired by all the different types of locations that are available.  The story begins in the bustling city of Philadelphia, but it moves around quite a bit, taking in big cities and small towns, open countryside, and boggy swampland.  He brings forward a very interesting outsider's view of America.<br />I'm glad I let Stephen Gallagher's television work lure me into his mainstream novels.  I now have a second book of his waiting for me in my too-read pile.   If this book is anything to go by, then I'll have a great story awaiting me filled with memorable characters, and genuinely unsettling thrills and imagery.  I'm looking forward to my next Gallagher novel.	2003-08-08
US	50631983	R368WY5NVGY1TG	0426204522	175064122	Toy Soldiers (Doctor Who the New Adventures)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	The March of the Wooden Soliders	TOY SOLDIERS, to be brief, is a collection of some absolutely brilliant set pieces tied together in a plot that is merely adequate.  Paul Leonard definitely knows how to write a good sentence.  He has a great ability to construct an emotional and heart-tugging scene.  He even creates some extremely worthy characters.  But the talent to put all those excellent pieces together in a coherent story is something that has at times escaped him during the course of his writing career.  Fortunately, in this instance, it isn't enough to derail the project.  The finished product is a little bit less than the sum of its parts, but I'm not going to complain too much when the author uses such quality parts.<br />In post-WWI Europe, most of the young men are dead.  But something is happening to those that are left; children are being kidnapped, and the only clue is that each child was given a teddy bear by a mysterious stranger shortly before vanishing.  The Doctor, Benny, Chris and Roz are, of course, investigating the disappearances.  Chris and Roz stay in Europe looking for the responsible parties.  The Doctor and Benny soon find themselves trapped on a planet called Q'ell, where the children are being forced to fight and die alongside aliens in a war that seems to serve no purpose.<br />The regular characters are extremely well portrayed here.  They all have their place and their function, but there is room enough for the characters to move around.  Roz and Chris pair off each other entertainingly within the larger group, while the Seventh Doctor and Benny remain practically writer-proof.  Leonard is the first author since Andy Lane in ORIGINAL SIN to make effective use of the two Adjudicators, and it's great to see them back on form.<br />I particularly liked how, in the beginning, we see the TARDIS crew exclusively from the standpoint of the secondary characters that they encounter.  We are allowed to view them as strange, different people who radiate an aura of power.  Thisis the sort of thing that Andrew Cartmel liked to do in his novels, but he usually made the Doctor seem like a force of nature, something to be in awe of.  Here, there is a sense of that, but they feel more like guardian angels, albeit ones dressed in unfamiliar clothes and speaking of strange anachronistic things.<br />The discussions on war, killing, death and hate are, for the most part, quite interesting.  Unfortunately, there are one or two places where Leonard crosses the line between subtle hinting, and sledgehammer moralizing.  I really appreciated the sequence where Roz unknowingly mimicked a 20th century xenophobic woman.  I didn't like it so much when the author pointed out how clever the comparison was.  Still, the understated portions outweigh the heavy-handedness, so the batting average on this count is fairly good even if there are a few obvious missteps.<br />During the beginning of this book, the imagery and situations that Leonard was throwing at me gave me goose bumps while reading.  Towards the end, some of the luster had faded, and while the ending was weak comparatively, it still made for a satisfactory conclusion.  Overall, the book does overcome its flaws, and I wish that I hadn't waited so long to read this one.<br />(I do not seem to have good luck with the physical copies of this book I have owned.  When I first bought the book back in the mid-90s, it wasn't until I got home from the bookstore that I realized I had purchased a incorrectly bound copy; opening the front cover revealed not the publishing information or blank filler, but page number 201.  Pages 201 through to the end replaced the first forty pages of the book, and those first forty pages were not to be found anywhere within the covers.  I promptly made a mental note to take the novel back to the shop and obtain a free replacement.  Flash-forward to the year 2002, and I discovered that I had never got around to doing that.  I bought myself a copy on-line that fortunately had all the pages, but on this one the margins were messed up, sometimes being too close to the outside, and, worse, sometimes being too close to the center to read the text properly.  Oh well, on some days you just can't win.)	2003-08-01

The first was the picture of the Chelonian.  The Chelonians are from a previous NA, THE HIGHEST SCIENCE, and were one of the poorer creations of the entire range.  The second was the name Gareth Roberts staring at me mockingly from the front.  I read both of Roberts' previous NAs and found them to be unmemorable, unlikable and turgid reads.  I dreaded reaching for this novel.  (The third odd thing about the cover is, of course, those slugs climbing down the cave wall.  Is it just me, or do they look incredibly rude?)<br />So, it was to my utter shock that I found myself really enjoying the beginning of the book.  The story revolves around a planet called Zamper whose sole industry revolves around the creation of shockingly powerful spacecrafts.  In usual Doctor Who tradition, the planet's population consists entirely of five or six people, while the work of building starships rests on the backs of some rather ugly little alien slug things.  This work has been going on for five centuries, and no one seems to know exactly who created this world, or how the apparently mindless slugs are able to generate these highly advanced technologies.  It should be noted that not all of the questions raised are eventually answered.<br />As I said, I found the beginning of the story to be quite absorbing.  The various mysteries are set up quite nicely with intriguing clues dropped here and there.  The cast is extremely small, but gives the book a rather cozy feeling at first.  I should note that while &quot;cozy&quot; isn't an adjective I would be normally be happy in describing a book as, compared to what I was expecting, &quot;cozy&quot; was great.  Even the Chelonians who I thought were absolutely horrific in their previous outing didn't annoy me.  In fact, I was quite amused and entertained by their antics.<br />Unfortunately, as the book progressed, my interest waned.  ZAMPERhas a rather small page count (clocking in at barely two-hundred and fifty), but it really would have worked better with about a hundred less.  This is a short novella stretched out to the size of a novel.  The middle hundred or so pages consist of people wandering through corridors, crawling through caves, sitting around in hotel rooms and other scenes of no excitement.  <br />The ending of the story is the final nail in the coffin.  The Doctor's plan to save the day is absolutely ridiculous.  Roberts can't figure out what to do with certain characters, so he kills off most of them off-screen.  It feels as though he knew he had a poor ending to his story in mind, so he kept padding out the middle sections hoping that by the time he got to the end, he'd have thought of something better.<br />Well, he didn't.  At least, I don't think he did.  If the ending that he came up with was actually better than another one he thought of, then I cannot imagine how unbelievably poor that one would have been.  If I had stopped reading ZAMPER at about the one-hundred-page mark, I probably would have considered this as Roberts finally putting out a decent and enjoyable book after two major clunkers.  Unfortunately, having survived the middle padding and the final decent into muddled incoherence, I would not be able to say that.  I understand that Roberts' Missing Adventures were far superior to his attempts at writing for the Seventh Doctor.  I certainly hope this is true.  I could not recommend ZAMPER to anyone because of its bungling of its own potential and its sad collapse into boring corridor-running and cardboard-characterization.  Yet, it's the Roberts NA that I enjoyed the most.  That, to me, speaks volumes.	2003-07-27
US	50631983	R19GPFZYE89A1A	0140185003	179354174	The Quiet American (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)	Books	5	315	330	N	N	&quot;I don't like Ike.&quot;	I can honestly say that I've spent more time thinking about the events of Graham Greene's THE QUIET AMERICAN than of any other book I've read in months.  In short, this is the story of America's involvement in Vietnam, full stop.  Astounding is the fact that this was written between 1952 and 1955, yet can serve as a metaphor for almost two further decades of US involvement in that region.<br />This is no simple tale, although it can be read as one.  It works on many different levels.  In its simplest form, this is a story about two foreigners in Indo-China: a middle-aged British reporter, and a young idealistic American.  They involve themselves in two main plots: one concerning the French Army's battle with the Vietminh, and the second, concerning the two men's relationship with a native woman and the subsequent fight for her affections.  On this level, THE QUIET AMERICAN works as an effective thriller.  Who is the mysterious &quot;third force&quot; that Pyle, the American, is aiding?  Why is he even there, and why is he providing aid to this group?  Will Fowler, the British journalist, abandon his policy of neutrality and enter into the conflict?  Who will end up with the girl at the end?<br />But there are all sorts of other subtexts and subtleties going on here.  Pyle isn't just &quot;the quiet American&quot;; he is America -- at least as far as the US's involvement in Vietnam is concerned.  And the difference in age between Pyle and Fowler is no random chance.  Fowler is the older man; his country has already had its expansionist, colonial period.  Fowler already knows what it's like to get one's fingers burnt interfering in other people's conflicts.  But Pyle won't be told.  He's the young inexperienced man who has to find out for himself -- to the detriment of everyone.<br />This isn't just a simplistic &quot;America = idealistic, good-hearted, but naive&quot; or &quot;England = experienced, weary, and impotent&quot; view of the world.  While Greene builds onseveral stereotypes of the Old and the New Worlds, he goes much farther beyond that.  Both men desire Phuong (the Vietnamese woman), but for starkly different reasons.  The woman's own interests are kept to herself deliberately.  We learn far more about Pyle and Fowler simply by the way in which they view the woman.  On a purely personal level, the characterization is heart-wrenching.  When looked at on a national level as far as what the two men represent, it is amazingly thought provoking.<br />After reading THE QUIET AMERICAN, I kept replaying and rethinking a number of its scenes and breaking down the characters as much as I could.  There is a lot going on here, and much of what Greene wrote about wouldn't fully come into being for a number of years after the book's publication.  There are many layers of subtleties occurring in this book's pages, and while I'm certain that I have not yet caught them all, it is not through a lack of interest.  This is a very powerful book, and should be on everyone's &quot;To Read&quot; list.	2003-07-22
US	50631983	R1P3UDO5DFW4KD	0426204468	493897121	Sky Pirates! or the Eyes of the Schirron (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Dave Stone! by Sky Pirates	Having heard a lot about SKY PIRATES! over the years, but never having previously read the book myself, I admit to having had certain expectations going into it.  This one certainly seems to be a love-it or hate-it novel; at least, that was the impression that I got from various on-line discussions.  So, it was a bit of a surprise when I actually got around to reading it and found myself being quite bored with long stretches of it.  Of all the things I was expecting, boredom wasn't one of them.<br />Yes, &quot;boredom&quot; adequately describes my reaction to the first hundred or so pages of SKY PIRATES!.  Now, I have to keep in mind that while reading those opening sections, I was far too busy with a number of unavoidable activities, and the time I had during the day for reading was drastically reduced.  But with this as my current book, I never felt that I was missing anything.  I never felt the overriding need to sneak more time from some other activity in order to get through a few more pages.  I only had time to read one short chapter an evening, and I really never felt the need to read any more than that.<br />For a book that is based upon a treasure hunt of sorts, it takes a considerable amount of time for the characters to actually get around to it.  Until the voyage actually begins, the book consists of a whole lot of throat clearing.  There are a lot of pointless interludes, random observations, and passages that aren't nearly as funny as they're supposed to be.  Some of the jokes are indeed hilarious.  Some of them are just tiresome.  Despite the deliberate wackiness, the plot points are built up in a relatively logical manner (once one works through all of the distractions); the only problem is it just takes too long to get to each one.<br />Fortunately, my interest gradually increased as the book moved further along.  Once Stone gets around to actually telling the story, he puts a lot of fun things into it.  Of particular note are the alien Sloathes, aspecies who talk like how one would expect Yoda to sound if that little, green, Grover-voiced guy had been born with a touch of Tourette's syndrome.  They're utterly hilarious, and it's no wonder that I heard much about these creatures years before I actually read the book.<br />But, in addition to the comedy, there's quite a dark story being told in here.  It almost feels like a Jim Mortimore novel at times; it includes an all-powerful alien menace (putting millions upon millions of people in danger), a manipulative, amoral Doctor, and an ethical decision affecting the lives of every population within a certain astronomical region.  Not exactly the sort of thing I was expecting given the goofy illustration of Sylvester McCoy on the cover.<br />I'm not quite sure how to sum up SKY PIRATES!.  &quot;Uneven&quot; would probably be the word I'd attempt using to describe my overall reaction.  Despite the tiresome beginning, I did end up enjoying the book.  But there are too many little awkward pieces (including &quot;funny&quot; pieces that aren't, well, funny) for me to truly say that I thought it was a very good novel.  Looking around at other reviews, it seems to be held as common wisdom that this book could have done with some serious editing, taking it down from its larger-than-average 337 pages to a more reasonable 250-275.  I can't say that I'd disagree with that view.  While fifty pages may not seem like a lot, if the story hadn't taken so long to get to where it was going, I probably would have felt more of a desire to pay attention during the middle and end.	2003-07-18
US	50631983	RZC8UIZZKHFYI	0426204441	147913072	Original Sin (Doctor Who the New Adventures)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Original Gangster	What do you say about the book that does everything?  Okay, so maybe &quot;everything&quot; is a bit of an exaggeration.  But ORIGINAL SIN instantly became one of my favorites when I first read it, and I'm happy to find that my original opinion survived the book's reread.  There's just too much good stuff here not to like it.<br />Andy Lane creates a lot of future history in this book.  I'm not necessarily a fan of world-building; sometimes an author will be so busy creating a setting that they forget to actually have anything happen in it.  But Lane fails to fall into that trap.  The thirtieth-century Earth of ORIGINAL SIN is detailed, gritty, realistic and fantastically well conveyed.  The poor dwell in the undertown, in the shadows of the floating cities of Earth, while the better off live above, but can only visit the floors and levels below their own.  The rich can choose to visit and see the poor, but the poor must be separated out from the wealthy.  Roaming around the planet are the honor-bound Adjudicators, dispensing justice and trying to keep the world safe as it plunges into madness and terror during the unfolding of the story.  The overcities and undertown, taken from a few throwaway mentions in past novelisations, are so fully fleshed out here that the New Adventures could have set dozens of stories in these locations without exhausting the potential.  <br />The characters depicted here are also wonderful creations.  I remember reading somewhere at the time of this publication that Chris Cwej and Roz Forrester were not originally intended to be companions, but only became so after the editors saw how well they were turning out.  Whether this is true or not, I don't know.  But it's easy to see how someone in charge of the line could pick out continuing characters from a novel this rich in realistic and well-drawn people.<br />But before I overwhelm you with talk of the hardboiled setting and the no-nonsense characters, I must point out that there's a certain whimsy present in the proceedings.  The jokes (and there are a number of them) are actually quite funny.  There's a wonderful balance between the serious and the amusing.  Many books in the Doctor Who range try to be too much of one or the other, but Andy Lane walks this line perfectly.  The Doctor and Benny in particular are depicted well, being both intelligent and droll.  The grittiness is never overwhelming; anytime the story looks to be taking itself a little too seriously, Lane instantly takes the pomposity out with a clever piece of dialog or a hilarious one-liner.<br />And I haven't even mentioned the storyline yet.  It's actually fairly simple on the surface, but deceptively engaging.  There's a lot of standard Doctor Who material here: unsolved murders, a vast conspiracy, an alien menace threatening Earth, people going stark raving mad, etc, etc.  But even the stuff we've seen before never feels old or recycled.  The plot moves quickly, and my interest never flagged.  In the Acknowledgements, Lane mentions that he abandoned the original plot part of the way through and ended up improvising much of what appeared in the final product.  All I can say is that he must have taken great notes on the way to the end, because the conclusion is quite good and perfectly logical.<br />There are just too many great things in this book to give them all the attention they deserve.  The extracts from &quot;The Empire Today&quot; (proving that Fox News and CNN will still be around a millennium from now) that open each chapter.  The witty banter between the Doctor and his foes.  The bizarre names that the alien Hith have given themselves as reminders of their lost past.  The fleshing out of the Samurai-like Adjudicators' backstory.  The only thing that really irritated me were the constant continuity references that kept popping up all over the place.  I really don't mind a sprinkle of them here and there, but there sure seemed to be a hell of a lot of them in this oneand I couldn't figure out what purpose they were supposed to serve.<br />ORIGINAL SIN launched two new companions, and brought back an old enemy for the Doctor to fight.  But regardless of the effect that the book had outside of its own covers, it's a seriously good tale in its own right.  Andy Lane had quite a task following up the delightful and entertaining ALL-CONSUMING FIRE, but here he proved that he was as skilled at bring the thirtieth-century to life as he was at capturing the nineteenth-century of Sherlock Holmes.  Recommended for all Doctor Who fans.	2003-07-17
US	50631983	R9MH60ORJQI5G	0684855364	181423734	A SONG OF STONE: A Novel	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Very Rocky	A SONG OF STONE (my introduction to the esteemed Iain Banks) presented me with a dilemma, and I'm not quite sure how to describe my thoughts concerning this novel.  I liked the narrative voice, I enjoyed the writing style, and I was occasionally intrigued by the characters.  But I'm not sure I liked the book.  It has some fascinating pieces, yet it also contains portions that I would describe as pure dreck.  It contains some shocking pieces of violence and the cruelty of humanity, but they aren't directed in any specific way.  The blood and the gore just ends up feeling gratuitous rather than purposeful, and after a while I just could make myself care about it.<br />The book is mostly based upon its setting and two main characters.  The setting is an unspecific country (it feels vaguely European) ripped apart by a war, the exact cause of which is irrelevant to the story.  The first character of note is the narrator, and the second is a female solider.  Both almost reach the point where they feel like real people, yet somehow manage to remain cartoonish.  The book relies very heavily upon the strength of its characters, but they aren't quite tough enough to carry the load.  They make a lot of speeches and, while some have genuine insight, they just tend to ramble on about life, the universe and everything.  When Banks has something to say, the soliloquies work.  But when the speeches are there merely there to give the characters something to do, the results can be utterly uninteresting.<br />The plot is rambling.  It goes off in several directions, and doesn't really seem to have a coherent structure.  People do things because the author makes them do things, but I couldn't quite grasp what anyone's motivation was.  The story is basically just a load of small set pieces bound together by the characters' experiences on the fringes of the war.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of them, but there are just too many places where the sledgehammer of the metaphorsjust become too painful and unappealing.  Ultimately, the book seems to think that it is far cleverer than it actually is.<br />And yet, there are hints of a fabulous book lurking beneath the oppressive and incoherent surface.  The hell that every person is going through is well realized -- from the physical drain that accompanies the conflict to the mental and emotional scarring that it inflicts.  The inability to escape is a theme that keeps being brought home, and for the most part it is effective.  Had the rest of the book been as successful as these sections, I think I would have loved this book (and indeed I found myself thinking very positive thoughts towards it at the very beginning).  Unfortunately, the quality is not sustained throughout.<br />I doubt I'll ever be bothered to read A SONG OF STONE again, yet I cannot say that I completely hated the experience of reading it once.  It's certainly unpleasant, but that's mostly a deliberate choice.  Still, by the end of the story, I just couldn't find myself caring about the characters or what happened to them.  Sometimes the imagery and metaphors are inspired; other times they are just banal.  It feels as though it was written on autopilot -- as though a good author just couldn't get around to putting his full effort into this one.  Given Banks' impressive reputation, I suspect that he has written better books.  And although this one left a faintly bad taste in my mouth, I think I will end up giving Mr. Banks another try.	2003-07-16
US	50631983	R31MJV2XC4GW7Z	0394758277	283946848	Farewell, My Lovely	Books	4	42	47	N	N	Punching, and shooting, and boozing -- oh my!	Raymond Chandler was such a master at his style of prose that you only have to read the first two paragraphs of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY to know exactly what sort of story you're in for.  Those two paragraphs perfectly set up the plot that follows: a thriller crossing in and out of the racial divisions of 1940's Los Angeles involving seedy speakeasies, and off-shore gambling, with double-crossing as far as the eye can see.  Wonderfully gritty stuff.<br />This particular Chandler novel has a lot going for it.  The hero, Philip Marlowe, is as entertaining as ever.  The setting is the familiar scene of other Chandler stories -- alive, heavy and oppressively Los Angeles.  The plot is logical, but jumps around a lot, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, the more it moves around, the more room Chandler has to incorporate evil-doings; I quite lost track of exactly how many crimes are committed or alluded to during the course of the book.  No matter how farfetched it is, Chandler's prose is utterly gripping and absorbing.<br />I think Philip Marlowe must drink his weight in cheap liquor several times over during the course of this adventure, but you can't help but like the guy.  He punches, he shoots, he boozes.  He even solves the case by the end.  He sure takes a beating in this one, but he keeps coming back for more.  He's everything a pulp detective should be - angry, arrogant, determined, and with just a hint of pathos to make him interesting enough to carry the story.<br />The book as a whole is just too appealing and entertaining not to be a fun experience.  Chandler is pretty much the benchmark for these sorts of stories about guns, police, and corruption, so if you like the genre, you might as well read the man who invented it.  Tough guys yelling, \\"Beat it!\\" at each other might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Chandler is so good as telling the story that any inadequacies in the conventions of this genre are wallpapered over with some slick dialog and snappy comebacks.<br />I read FAREWELL, MY LOVELY more for the great atmosphere and tone than for its overall plot.  The fact that the storyline wraps up nicely at the end is merely a bonus.  But the real way to enjoy this book is to just let the atmosphere, the characters and the prose just wash over you.	2003-07-15
US	50631983	R2M890Z5A5K72L	0426204433	815700631	Human Nature (Doctor Who the New Adventures)	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Time Lord Nature	(Note: This book is available as a free e-book on the BBC's Cult website.)<br />When I first read HUMAN NATURE back in 1995 or 1996, I thought it was quite good.  Not perfect, but quite good.  Since the mid-90s, the book's reputation has done nothing but skyrocket.  Finally declared as the greatest New Adventure in various polls and reviews, I fully expect to see it posited as the supreme work of English fiction by sometime in the next century.<br />Rereading it today (well, last week to be specific), I found that my opinion hadn't changed all that much.  It's still a really good book with some outstanding sequences and genuine emotion.  But it also contains some fairly blatant missteps.  It's a shame that Paul Cornell didn't quite make his villains as interesting as his heroes, given that both factions are given huge amounts of screen time.<br />The storyline is very simple, very traditional in all but one major area.  The Doctor decides to take a vacation.  Weary with the weights and responsibilities of being the Intergalactic Man Of Mystery, he decides to create an artificial persona for himself (the hints of where his false memories come from are great fun), and places his consciousness into the human body of Dr. John Smith (his own body, after undergoing a gobbledygook process to temporarily rid it of its Gallifreyan heritage).  While his own thoughts, experiences, and Time Lord know-how are placed into a container, a group of alien baddies arrives on Earth intending to steal the Doctor's essence for their own nefarious schemes.<br />Everyone who discusses this book eventually gets around to criticizing the alien Aubertides.  I will not be breaking from convention.  They really are pathetic adversaries.  Actually, it would be more accurate to describe them as depressingly ordinary.  While the Smith/Doctor storyline captivates and enthralls the reader, one is instantly jolted back to banality every time we're forced to continue with the Adventures Of The Irritating Aliens.  And the biggest problem of all is that they're present and nauseating for so much of the book.  Had they just appeared from time to time to remind us of the main Doctor Who practices, they wouldn't have been quite so annoying.  (Unfortunately, Cornell would not learn from this lesson.  Cavis and Gandar of SHADOWS OF AVALON somehow manage to be much, much worse.)<br />Cornell also cheats a bit with his plotting.  Fortunately, he's a strong enough writer to be able to keep the story moving fast enough, so that most of the stretches aren't quite as damning as they would be had they come from the pen of a lesser.  Even so, there are some absolutely insane coincidences, people acting stupid just to move the plot along, and places where the action stops completely dead for some silly and preaching moralizing.<br />I apologize for having spent so much time taking about the portions of HUMAN NATURE I found to be irritating, because overall, even with its flaws, this is still a damned good book.  The progression of Dr. John Smith back into the Doctor figure is extraordinarily well done.  His relationship with a rather mundane Earth woman is nicely understated.  I loved the fact that while I (and Benny) found her to be slightly haughty and grating, I could still understand completely how Smith started falling for her.<br />What Cornell does with the Doctor here is absolutely fantastic.  Seeing Smith slowly but surely regaining his essential characteristics is mind-blowing.  The way that Cornell places the crucial Doctor qualities into another secondary character is subtly cool.  The final thirty pages are gorgeous.<br />In other places, the book also scores a bull's-eye.  I read this one straight after SANCTUARY, and the difference in writing couldn't have been any more obvious.  While the previous tome had dense prose that I found difficult and distracting, the pages in HUMAN NATURE just flew by.  The words and phrases can seem as light as a feather, but can beutterly devastating when need be.  It's like an expensive, rare, and pleasant wine.  A few sips are absolute heaven, and after a good long session, you find yourself knocked on your butt.<br />As I said, I liked HUMAN NATURE despite its fairly obvious flaws.  On the other hand, I think somewhere out there is a version of this book written entirely as extracts from the dairies of Benny and Dr. John Smith, keeping the character stuff even more at the forefront, and banishing the Aubertides to well-deserved obscurity.  That version may very well be the greatest Doctor Who story of all time.  But that's not the version we have here, which isn't even the best of Paul Cornell.  Yet it's still quite good and definitely worth reading.	2003-06-08
US	50631983	R3U85P2FNS175W	0426204395	918119635	Sanctuary (Doctor Who-The New Adventures Series)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Zzzzzzzzzzzanctuary	SANCTUARY did one thing very right.  But it drowned that one shining beacon of quality in a plethora of things that were off, or dull, or just unnecessary.  I found reading this to be a very frustrating experience.  On the surface, it has a lot going for it.  It's a pure historical, which hadn't been seen for a long time.  It features just the Doctor and Benny, a combination that wasn't used as often as it should have been.  The setting (medieval France with the Crusades as a backdrop) is intriguing.  However, virtually nothing is executed well.  The sole exceptions are the secondary character of Guy de Carnac and his relationship with Benny.<br />The story opens with a pointless and endless sequence of the Doctor and Benny surviving some technobabble invader, which eventually deposits them in the main portion of the plot.  If this section had been removed, nothing at all would have been lost.  I never really understood the lengths that some authors will go through to insert the Doctor and companion team into the story.  CAVES OF ANDROZANI aired here recently, and the difference between that opening and SANCTUARY's couldn't have been more pronounced.  Robert Holmes doesn't bother with long explanations about why the Doctor happened to land on Androzani Minor; he just launches into the story at full-speed.  SANCTUARY would have been greatly helped had the introduction explanations been completely removed.  The only reason they seem to exist here is for the author to indulge in numerous and inane continuity references.  The book is virtually at a standstill until McIntee gets all of this out of his system.<br />The main problem that I had with SANCTUARY is that is was deathly boring.  There was a one hundred, fifty-page section in the middle that I simply had to force myself to get through.  The single interesting thing going on was the nicely understated relationship developing between Benny and Guy de Carnac.  I looked forward to these sections to pull me through the tedium that was the rest of the story.  I just couldn't make myself care about any part of the main plot.  The Doctor's subplot is dull.  The whodunit is dull.  The Inquisition-era politics is dull.  The fight scenes go on for far too long, and they're dull.  The base-under-siege mentality is unoriginal, and dull.  I simply couldn't get excited about any of these parts of the story.  If I ever decide to reread this one, I think I'll restrict myself to only reading the Guy portions, and to completely skip the rest.<br />Despite not liking most of SANCTUARY, if McIntee's Guy trilogy of books ever materializes, I'd be interested in reading them.  Guy de Carnac is not only one of the few good things about this novel, but he is a genuinely intriguing character in his own right.  His reactions to his surroundings, his attitude, his point of view and his back-story are all quite strong.  He does fall into cliché at times, but is a solid enough character in other ways to rise above that.  One of the best moments in the story comes as a dream/flashback sequence in the later half, featuring an examination of Guy's background.  It's a shocking moment, and one that shines as a giant diamond in a sea of turgid writing. <br />As well as being a great cure for insomnia, the book does itself no favors on the prose-front either.  When it's not purple, it's workmanlike.  When it's not workmanlike, it's awkward.  When it's not awkward, it's incomprehensible.  The aforementioned dream sequence is the only point in the book when the actual writing itself doesn't interfere with the story being told.<br />And, yet, I feel that buried in here somewhere was a really good story.  If the numerous fight scenes had been harshly trimmed back, if the lethargic opening scenes were cut entirely, if some of the secondary characters had been written as people rather than as instruments to further the plot, if the editor had been a little more liberal with the red ink.  If all these things had beendone, I think we'd be looking at a really good story.  Of course, it would only be about half as long and would probably need to be printed in a gigantic font to boost the page-count, but we can't have everything, can we?	2003-06-01
US	50631983	RMZ5GOGXL2S1P	0426205103	151713301	Ship of Fools (The New Adventures Series)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Ship of Stones	After a semester that was far more work-intensive that I had been expecting, my brain demanded something fun and relaxing.  Scanning my vast piles of unread books, I searched for something suitable, my eyes finally coming upon the next Benny novel that I had yet to peruse.  Looking at the author's name on the cover, I hesitated.  Would this be the Dave Stone who wrote the entertaining and enjoyable THE SLOW EMPIRE, or would it be the turgid and self-indulgent Dave Stone who thrust HEART OF TARDIS onto an unsuspecting world?  I decided to take a gamble.<br />Thankfully, I found SHIP OF FOOLS to be a fun and entertaining adventure that played to Dave Stone's strengths rather than falling back on his more annoying authorial habits.  It's an insane murder-mystery; most of the action takes place on a single location.  An infamous jewel thief (known only as \\"the Cat's Paw\\") and Benny are both onboard the same intergalactic starship.  When passengers begin dying in a host of bizarre ways, it's up to Benny to drink as much as possible, and to solve the mystery, if she can get around to it.  This would be the sort of thing that Agatha Christie would write if someone removed all of her blood and replaced it with LSD.<br />The various clichés and stereotypes that we expect from these sorts of whodunits are all brought out and lovingly mocked.  The most amusing of these are the various \\"great detectives\\" who all happen to be onboard the ship, and will be very familiar to fans of mystery novels, television shows and movies.  While some of the jokes seem to tire by the end, the majority are at least amusing.  The pacing is fast enough so that even the jokes that fall with a clunk aren't dwelt upon for too long.<br />I found the mystery aspects of the story to be genuinely unpredictable.  It's virtually impossible to figure out which diversions are actual clues, and which ones are just a result of the author being slightly mad.  Expecting SHIP OF FOOLS to follow the conventions of the genre is a pointless task.  I recommend just reading it as an entertaining adventure, and then being occasionally amused by the jaunts into the mystery story.<br />It's an odd, but enjoyable book that moves from over-the-top cartoon violence into occasional bleakness and then back again.  But for all of Dave Stone's madness, the plot has method to it.  It's not always quite as funny as it's trying to be, but it did get me to laugh out loud a couple of times.  Recommended as a fluffy piece of fun with a solid enough center.	2003-05-18

INFINITE REQUIEM was a book that I thought had a very strong beginning with a lot of potential set up early on.  Initially, I enthusiastically turned the pages, extremely curious as to what was going to happen next.  By the time I got to the end, I was somewhat disappointed and had ended up simply not caring what any of the characters did.  The process of getting from one reaction to the other was so gradual that I really didn't notice it happening at all during my first read.  But each time I picked the book back up after taking a break, it was with less eagerness than I had felt before.  I can't describe any specific plot-point or event to say that this is where I got fed up; it just seems to be a case of too much build-up and not enough pay-off.<br />The beginning has a large portion focused upon events taking place on modern-day Earth, and it was these sections that I found most enjoyable.  As the book progresses, the attention shifts towards future and outer space settings.  The farther away the action drifts from Earth, the less interested I became in the events that were unfolding.  By the time the story has reached the part where everything takes place in the distant future, on a far-away planet, in some strange virtual reality thingy (or whatever), I had just gone completely past the point of caring.  This really is a shame, as Blythe tells the modern-day Earth sections with real heart.  Once that setting is abandoned, the book becomes much poorer for it.<br />There are a few other things about INFINITE REQUIEM that I enjoyed.  The Phractons are quite an interesting creation, feeling like proper aliens and far more worthy of attention than the vastly overrated and boring Chelonians.  I also liked the follow-ups pertaining to events in the previous adventure, SET PIECE.  One gets the impression that Kate Orman sent Blythe a checklist of all the bodily injuries that the Doctor and Benny had suffered in that book so that he could go through the bruises one byone.  Blythe handles the sections dealing with the recent departure of Ace as sensitively and maturely as one would hope for.<br />There are also a few things in the narrative, their reason for inclusion being one that I just couldn't fathom.  Benny finds a holographic projector that displays a simulation of the Doctor, and this projection becomes a running plot-strand in the story.  Why is this in the book?  I don't know; it doesn't add anything and only becomes annoying as the pointless distraction keeps getting pulled out.  A character from Blythe's previous NA (THE DIMENSION RIDERS) comes back.  Why?  I don't know; he's an all-right character, I suppose, he just doesn't strike me as being interesting enough to merit a return appearance.  The narrative goes to great lengths to expound on the familial relationship between two of the characters.  Why?  I don't know; I suspect that the story was going somewhere with this, but it just ended up being angsty and misplaced.<br />This isn't a particularly awful story, it just has an unfortunate inconsequential feel.  Certain parts read as though they weren't thought through as fully as they should have been, as if the author came up with some potentially great ideas but never got around to integrating them properly with each other or with the story.  I wouldn't mind seeing Blythe return to the Doctor Who book range.  If he weren't attempting to squeeze too many science-fiction concepts into his work, I think he could produce something fantastic.	2003-05-17
US	50631983	RNPBC6VWQEZXU	0890068291	159753886	Internet and Intranet Security	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An excellent beginning	I found Rolf Oppliger's INTERNET AND INTRANET SECURITY (SECOND EDITION) to be an invaluable tool for helping me get up to speed on some of the fundamental aspects involved in computer network security.  This taught me a lot that I needed to know and it did so without being confusing.  This book was an assigned text for an Enterprise Security class that I took, and it was an invaluable learning aid, as well as a great resource.<br />The text covers fundamentals (a TCP/IP networking overview, OSI Architecture, various cryptographic techniques and the attacks they are designed to thwart), access control (explaining packet-filters, application and circuit level gateways, and firewalls), and communications protocols/security (Network Access Layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer, Application Layer, and message security protocols).  Also included is a chapter on Public Key Infrastructures.  The book is almost totally focused on teaching theory, with only scant attention paid to real-world implementations.  This is not a drawback.  If a student learns everything this book has to offer, then that will be a huge advantage when it comes time to turn one's attention towards actual applications.<br />Most topics that Oppliger discusses include a brief history of the subject.  This allows the student to really get a handle on why a system evolved in the way that it did.  Also helpful are the numerous pointers to web pages and other texts to supplement the information given here.  This book is mostly text-based; pictures, figures and tables are present but used sparingly.<br />Overall, I would recommend this book to any student new to the field or any novice looking for insight into the topics of computer network security.  It casts a very wide net, and while most specifics will be given more depth in other, more specialized books, the amount of information revealed here is more than adequate.	2003-05-16
US	50631983	RAC4QY33T19NO	0553236725	483289343	I Sing the Body Electric	Books	4	2	2	N	N	"I Sing The Additional Grip/Electric!"	(Please note that the edition I am reviewing is the older publication that contains only the original 18 works that make up I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC!.)<br />I usually adore Ray Bradbury short story collections, but I think it would be more honest of me to say that I \\"merely\\" very much enjoyed I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC!.  While I wouldn't rank this as his best work, it contains a number of seductively powerful moments.  It's a wonderful set of quite varied fiction, however not all of the stories gave me the same emotional charge that I get out of other selections of Bradbury's writing.  It's still a compilation worth reading, of course, since even Bradbury on a mediocre day is still better than the vast majority of short story writers.<br />As with other Bradbury collections, it is difficult to characterize the feel of this.  The stories cover a smorgasbord of topics; included are stories about Mars colonies, Irish peasants, supernatural chickens, electric grandmothers, and a host of other mind-bending fictions.  You have to admire his creativity if nothing else.  And he has a fantastic way of making even the most bizarre of artifacts seem as familiar as apple pie and the smell of freshly cut grass.  His characters are painted with broad strokes, but they're so carefully crafted that you'll feel as though you've known them all your life.<br />Some of my favorite Bradbury stories are his most basic and uncomplicated ones, I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC! being no exception.  THE KILIMANJARO DEVICE is a simple tribute to Ernest Hemmingway written with a deceptive elegance.  The science fiction overtones of DOWNWIND FROM GETTYSBURG, THE LOST CITY OF MARS and the titular story mask some very real human emotions.  In some stories, youth and old age are brought together, with childlike enthusiasm touching characters at all points during their lives.  In other stories, depression and gloom are all-encompassing and inescapable.<br />On the other hand, there are a few stories that Ijust didn't care for.  And I must admit that the poem at the end (CHRISTUS APOLLO) did very little for me.  Still, it's testament to Bradbury's ability as a writer that the poorest stories can only fill me with mild indifference.  Very little here blew me away in the manner of his DANDELION WINE book, but there is nothing that I would refuse to read again.<br />I enjoyed I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC! during my initial read.  But I found myself appreciating the stories even more the second time around.  Bradbury excels at painting the whole spectrum of humanity, from the most noble to its most pathetic.  And he turns both extremes into very compelling stories.  This is probably not his greatest collection, but it is definitely not one to be skipped.	2003-05-15
US	50631983	R78A97I70O7L2	0426204360	982066254	Set Piece (Doctor Who-The New Adventures Series)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Set Pieces	Strangely enough, the first word that comes into my head when thinking about SET PIECE is \\"pleasant\\".  Now, \\"pleasant\\" may seem like an odd way to describe a book that opens with a 30-page extended torture sequence filled with disturbing imagery and psychological terrors, and which is punctuated by scenes of people vomiting.  Yet, as mesmerizing, shocking and disconcerting as those passages were, it was mostly the carefree and relaxed feel of the story that I ended up taking with me.<br />The plot is robust and acceptable, but it mostly takes a backseat to the character study of the three protagonists.  We see the Doctor coping, first with some extreme forms of torture, and then working his way through a science-fiction mystery threatening the whole fabric of space/time.  Benny tries to adjust to life sans Doctor in 18th Century France, and makes a journey with an archeological expedition in an attempt to reunite herself with her TARDIS crewmates.<br />But the character most focused upon in SET PIECE is, of course, Ace.  She is thrown backwards in time to Ancient Egypt, becoming, at various times, a warrior, a bodyguard and a waitress.  In short, pretty much everything that Ace went through during her television and book adventures is brought to the forefront and explored.  It makes for a leisurely pace, but Orman's writing skills mean that it is never boring or dull.  Even the relatively low-stakes subplots have a real weight and importance attached to them.  When the three are eventually reunited, the plot from the beginning is brought back to the forefront, but it almost feels like an afterthought.  The save-the-fabric-of-the-universe storyline is acceptable; it just doesn't carry the same gravity that the middle sections of the book do.<br />The plot moves fairly slowly to the benefit of the in-depth look at the characters.  The menace vaguely alluded to on the back cover remains mostly out of sight for much of the adventure, making but a few menacing cameos.  There's no real sense of urgency about the alleged danger, yet this doesn't come across as a mistake since it's obvious that the focus of the story is not on the mechanics of the plot.  The real story-mover comes in the form of Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart, an honest-to-God character rather than an ill-defined and vague alien menace.  Her own inner conflict allows her to have some great scenes with the Doctor.  The ambiguity surrounding her motivations and loyalties (brought about by a variety of reasons) feel authentic rather than gimmicky, and this allows her to be a genuinely unpredictable and dangerous character.<br />The first time I read SET PIECE, I thought it was okay.  Rereading it a few weeks ago, I thought it was better than I remembered.  Skipping through the pages, to refresh my memory before typing up this review, I found myself liking it even more.  It's quite a thoughtful book, and my appreciation increases the more I think about certain elements and events.  There are great little moments that are fun to read at the time, and there are loads of additional things that will have you taking a second, a third, and a fourth look back.  Recommended.<BR>.	2003-05-14
US	50631983	R3MXMLI44V4CXD	0060937866	151775653	A Year at the Movies: One Man's Filmgoing Odyssey	Books	4	56	56	N	Y	A Year's Worth of the Movie Sign	For those of you who don't know, Kevin &quot;Tom Servo&quot; Murphy took it upon himself to &quot;go to the movies&quot; at least once a day for the entirety of 2001, and to put that experience down on paper.  Given the amount of garbage that was passing for entertainment that year, this may seem like a fearsome challenge.  But Murphy appears to have relished the opportunity to get paid for what most of us consider a relaxing leisure-time activity.  And even acknowledging the aspects of movie-going that he disliked, one gets the impression that he at least enjoyed complaining about them.<br />A YEAR AT THE MOVIES is a collection of essays written during that year-long adventure.  Fifty-two chapters, one per week, detail everything that he felt worth mentioning.  Murphy engages in several gimmicks during the course of his book.  He attempts to find the smallest theatre in the world (apparently it's squeezed into some guy's house, and is an actual licensed and legal cinema).  He brings six different women to the same date movie on consecutive days (his wife is described on the back cover as &quot;long-suffering&quot;).  He smuggles in an entire turkey dinner on Thanksgiving Day (the man fits a table under his coat - if there was an Academy Award for table-sneaking, he'd deserve it).  He attempts spending a week eating nothing but concession stand food (again, his wife is described as &quot;long-suffering&quot;).  <br />However, as entertaining as these exploits are, I was more interested in the day-to-day things that Murphy picked up on during the year.  He contrasts the service and attention to detail present at mom-n-pop, independent theatres to the impersonal, uncaring experience one might expect to see at the nearest massive movie multiplex (which Murphy humorously refers to as &quot;googolplexes&quot;).  He looks at the reactions and discussions created by the small independent films, and counterpoints those thoughts with the ennui that seems to sweep over the audiences of the summer blockbusters, who become so uninvolved and distanced that they go merely to observe, to be vaguely distracted, and then to leave, never to think of the film again.<br />That said, I was definitely amused by some of his goofier antics.  Getting into multiplexes without paying, and pretentious folks who haunt his local movie theatre on Hong Kong Cinema Morning are just two of the subjects that meet with his brand of comedy.  Murphy was a writer on the ever-witty television show, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000, and a lot of those clever one-liners and quick humor are on display here.  There's even a cameo by former MST3K host Michael J. Nelson, who gets dragged along to a viewing of Corky &quot;Y'guys want some cookies?&quot; Romano.  Pity them.  Or laugh at them.  I did both.<br />The only really negative thing I have to say is that there was no table of contents, and no index.  So, when I look back, I have to randomly flip my way around the fifty-two essays to find exactly what it is that I want to reread.  Unless I managed to remember the date, I'm simply lost.  The book is written in chronological order of his cinema-going year, but the vast majority of the essays aren't time or season specific.  It's a minor quibble to be sure, yet it would be handy to have a quick way to find his essay on, say, why movies about rich people are usually lousy, or on the best way to sneak into the Cannes film festival, or on what it's like to see films in the land of the midnight sun.<br />I found A YEAR AT THE MOVIES to be a fun and occasionally thoughtful travelogue that maintains a good balance between being amusing and reflective.  Murphy is definitely a fan of the movies, so his comments come from a love of the craft, and a sense of frustration when it doesn't live up to its potential.  He comes across as a faintly snobbish curmudgeon in parts, but a very likeable guy all the same.  He's definitely an aficionado of most aspects involved with movie watching,and I found his enthusiasm contagious.	2003-05-13

It's not a bad book by any means; Clarke's imagination is at the forefront. The storyline is full of surprises, and while the characterizations are fairly shallow, that didn't adversely affect the overall book for me. Still, I couldn't help but feel that it wasn't quite as good as its hype would have one believe. It's a decent and engrossing novel, but I just didn't find it to be anything special.<br />There were parts of CHILDHOOD'S END that I just found to be too unbelievable. Now, I'm not talking about unrealistic science or an inability on my part to acknowledge the existence of aliens; I read quite a lot of science fiction, and these sorts of things I am more than willing to accept in fiction. No, to demonstrate what I found strange, I'll go through the back-cover blurb. It begins: \\"The Overlords appeared suddenly over every city - intellectually, technologically, and militarily superior to humankind.\\" So far, so good. It continues: \\"Benevolent, they made few demands: unify earth, eliminate poverty, and end war.\\" Again, nothing too shocking. Friendly aliens aren't going to make me throw down the book in disbelief. But the following bit I found to be a bit much: \\"With little rebellion, mankind agreed, and a golden age began.\\" Now personally I just can't see that happening as peacefully and simply as Clarke posits. And the book doesn't give us much more background that that short sentence. Clarke just skips right over parts like this that would be difficult to swallow. <br />I think part of my difficulty accepting large chunks of the exposition was the way in which Clarke chooses to deliver his narrative. The book skips and jumps through the decades, but also tries to keep itself grounded by introducing us to a variety of easily-exchangeable characters. Clarke is trying to do two things at once here, and in a book that's a slim 212 pages, he simply doesn't give himself enough room to do justice toboth. He wants to give us a grand sweeping vision of the future, where the stories of individuals are washed away in the march of time. But then he'll suddenly jump back and relate a chapter or two focusing on a handful of characters. Then it'll be back to the grand historical approach, leaving those individuals far behind. I think that Clarke could have pulled off this approach if he had an extra hundred pages to play around with. Unfortunately, he didn't, and the book ends up being at times neither one thing nor the other.<br />It sounds as if I'm being a bit too hard on this book, and I've devoted more time that I meant to on highlighting the negative points. But I did find a lot to enjoy here. Clarke writes a plot that I simply couldn't anticipate; many of the surprises caught me off-guard. Clarke is thinking big here. He's looking at mankind's place in a large universe and comparing our progress to what limitless potential there is out there. I really appreciated the scope of his vision.<br />It just seemed to me as if Clarke was trying to cram too much into the short amount of pages allotted. It forces him to keep rushing forward, not giving himself time to dwell on some of the ideas that he confronts us with. It also forces him to provide exposition by dumping huge blocks of narration at us, or simply by having characters give long speeches at each other. CHILDHOOD'S END is full of thought-provoking ideas, and I'd classify it as a good science-fiction novel, but I cannot honestly say that I found it a great one.	2003-05-01

WARLOCK is a collection of so many disparate ideas and strands that it stands as a real credit to Andrew Cartmel's skills and abilities that he not only wove them all together astoundingly well, but also managed to create a book that was engrossing, absorbing and absolutely unputdownable.  It's another tome in his canon of bleak futures and stories where the Doctor is more a force of nature than a guy who bothers showing up in books that have his name on the cover.  But its depressing nature is never gratuitous or overly unpleasant.  I wouldn't like to see a whole series of Doctor-less Doctor Who books (the little fellow shows up even less frequently here than in Cartmel's previous book, WARHEAD), but when an individual story is done as expertly as this one is, that is a detraction I am more than willing to accept.<br />The plot is a bit of a mish-mash when summarized, but it works amazingly well in execution.  There's a strange new drug called Warlock in the neighborhoods of the not-too-distant future.  The Doctor thinks there's something curious about it, so he sends Benny off to New York to investigate, while Ace wanders off into a sub-plot of her own involving hippies, sadistic henchmen, and animal testing.  Some gangsters, drug-dealers, and a sizable dose of trippy prose all get added to the mix.  Cartmel takes these pieces and hones them into a rollicking good read.<br />There's something wonderful about Cartmel's prose.  Ace spends several pages simply pottering around the Doctor's house on Allen Rd and it's absorbing.  One chapter is entirely devoted to one man being ignored and it's riveting.  Four whole chapters are spent waiting for cops to bust some drug-dealers and it's absolutely electrifying.  It's one of the bulkiest Doctor Who books published at 359 pages, and yet the words just speed by.  How does he do it?<br />The characters again become something that Cartmel excels at drawing.  Even relatively minor players are given intriguing back-stories andbelievable dialog.  This is a more character-based story than WARHEAD was, which makes sense, given the more introspective nature of the storyline.  The Warlock drug plays a heavy role in the plot, and many sequences revolve around the effects that it has on the minds of the users.  These sections contain a lot of great writing, with the paranoia and other effects produced by the drug being very realistically portrayed.  The portions of the story where characters attempt to navigate their way through the mind-bending and bizarre qualities of the Warlock drug were far and away my favorite parts.  The things that Cartmel does here are quite chilling.<br />There are some minor flaws.  One of the themes running through the book would appear to be that scientific testing on animals is immoral and wrong.  Whereas, all I got out of it was that scientific testing on animals is immortal and wrong if undertaken by a bunch of sadistic and maladjusted bullies.  Cartmel has occasional bouts of playing too heavy-handedly with his themes, which would be enough to derail a lesser book, but isn't an unpardonable sin here.  He also rushes the plot a bit at the end, which is excusable given the amount of stuff that he has going on, but also odd when one considers the large page count.  It would be greedy of me to wish for an extra fifty pages at the end to give the story a smoother conclusion, but a four hundred page WARLOCK is something I'd leap at the chance to read.<br />But these really are minor grumbles in a story that I hugely enjoyed.  While WARLOCK is technically billed as a sequel to WARHEAD, everything you need to know from that book is explained here.  So if you haven't read WARHEAD, it's safe to read WARLOCK.  If you have read WARHEAD and enjoyed it, then I can definitely recommend WARLOCK.  And if you haven't read either of them, then stop stalling, and get out there and read them both now.  Yeah.	2003-04-17

It is not a novel about the higher view of war, the way it is seen by governments and generals.  It is, in fact, the story of one man caught up in a war that he doesn't even seem to fully comprehend.  He and his friends are battered and wounded, and simply trying to survive each day as it comes.  The book is powerful and memorable.  Erich Maria Remarque shows us what war is like, and shows us a tale of people trying to stay alive, but becoming more and more alienated from the regular world they left behind.<br />The story is gritty, dirty and depressing.  It probably isn't exactly explaining what life was like for the German soldiers during WWI, but my guess is that it comes extremely close.  The men have trouble finding food, they are ordered around by sadistic officers, they are cold, and hungry - and there's a war going on, the nature of which means that literally at any second they could be killed or horribly maimed.  The book focuses on the death associated with the war, but it also spends a lot of time going over the suffering and the pain.  Remarque tells us of the soldiers wounded, of those slowly dying in no-man's land with no hope of being rescued or of dying a clean death.  The lucky ones are the ones who die quickly; the unlucky are in agony for days or weeks.<br />There really isn't much of a plot, which would certainly seem to be in keeping with the way an average solider would view the war.  The narrative bounces us around from the front lines, to the rear camps, to civilian villages in a sequence as random as it would have appeared to anyone involved in the war.  We can't see the reasoning behind any individual movement, and neither can our protagonist.  They are concerned only with the moment, the simple things that will keep them alive and as comfortable as possible.  Their occasional contacts with home and with civilian life highlight how different they have become and the difficulties the survivors will face when they attempt to reintegrate themselves with their old lives.<br />ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is a book that everyone should read, just so that the story of the average soldier is always carried on.  Even as television brings cursory and unrepresentative images of the battlefield to regular citizens, it is vital that everyone fully understands the horror that war is.  I can't say that this was a pleasant read, but it was a book that I found difficult to put down.	2003-04-14

The authors of WITTGENSTEIN'S POKER, David Edmonds and John Eidinow, are both BBC journalists, and that background makes them ideal for explaining what most casual observers would view as an obscure conflict, unworthy of great curiosity. The subject of the book is an argument between Karl Popper and Ludwig Wittgenstein, two great philosophers who probably wouldn't be considered household names (although I'm pleased to note that \\"Wittgenstein\\" is indeed present in my spellchecker). Legend has it that on October 25, 1946, a debate in a Cambridge conference room became so heated that Wittgenstein grabbed a red-hot poker from the fireplace and waved it in Popper's face. Legend also claims that despite his advantage in weaponry, Wittgenstein retreated after a particularly cutting remark from Popper. But is legend correct? And if so, why would two respected philosophers resort to taunting and the threat of physical violence? In 1998, the battle was the subject of renewed debate in the letters page of the Times Literary Supplement, where neither side could agree on what had actually occurred. The question piqued the interest of the two journalists and they attempted to uncover the truth.<br />The poker is to the authors as Rosebud was to the newspapermen in CITIZEN KANE. It is the impetus that allows Edmonds and Eidinow to begin their journey through a scattershot look at this portion of philosophy's history. They provide a fairly decent biography of both men, leaving out many unnecessary specifics, but giving enough information for the reader to understand both men's place in the world of philosophy. Along the way we see the similarities apparent in the lives of the two men. Both were Austrian philosophers. Both fled their homelands during the Second World War because of their Jewish heritage. Both men were fierce arguers and were both convinced of their inherent correctness. That said, they were not identical. Wittgenstein's family was one of the richest in the region, while Popper came from a fairly well-to-do family that had fallen on very rough times after the First World War.<br />In philosophy, they were diametrically opposed. Wittgenstein in his later years declared there were no fundamental philosophical problems, merely puzzles based on linguistics, tricks of language intrinsically bound to how human beings defined certain terms. The so-called problems came not from the real world, but from quirks in definitions. Popper, through his background in the philosophy of science, venomous disagreed. Philosophy progressed as other schools of thought progressed. We affirm or disregard theories, and we learn something about the universe every time that happens.<br />The authors spend more time detailing the background to the conflict than they do on the argument itself. However, while going through the lives of the two main characters, they oftentimes related some event in the past that would directly influence the argument. As for the way they handle the poker-waving incident itself, they are careful to provide as much information as possible. They reproduce the committee minutes of the encounter, they interview those attendees who are still alive today, and they pore through the records and memoirs written in the months and years after the event. After giving us the facts, they then cut down on those items that would appear to be most at odds with the rest. It's guesswork, they are quick to point out, determining which set of hazy remembrances is the most accurate.<br />The depth of background that the authors provide colors the way in which we view the eventual argument. Wittgenstein would often be agitated at meetings, and had in the past waved a poker, not to threaten a trembling rival, but to help emphasis positions he was taking. Popper was ruthless when it came to arguments, and would attempt to bury the opposition in a flurry of logic. It's easy to see how these two men might view each other on this afternoon, the point of their first and only meeting. A lot of the ambiguity and confusion seems to come down to the regular oddities in Wittgenstein's own behavior. Was he waving the poker in anger, or from unconscious habit? Did he storm off in disgust and humiliation, or was his hasty departure consistent with his custom of leaving discussions at seemingly random times? The authors don't give us direct answers, but give us more than enough information to make up our own minds.<br />Perhaps the authors provided us with an over-abundance of details, maybe more than we really needed to know. While the four chapters relating the story of the two men's separate escapes from the clutches of Nazi Germany made for occasionally fascinating reading, I was at a loss to see their relevance. On the other hand, while I'm not sure that I really needed to know that Wittgenstein munched on tomato sandwiches the morning of the poker-wave, those little factoids made this book more enjoyable to read. Hardcore Wittgenstein fans who want to know as much as possible about the actual fight will find the latter sections invaluable, though they might be a bored during the earlier, biographical parts. Anyone looking to further their knowledge of these two philosophers and their confrontation on that fateful October day should pick up this book immediately.<br />Notes: In addition to the main text, this book also includes some extras: a chronology of major events starting with the birth of Ludwig Wittgenstein on 26 April 1889 through to the death of Karl Popper on 17 September 1994; and an appendix including the series of seven letters from 1998 in the Times Literary Supplement (four of which are between Professor Peter Geach who was present at the conflict, and Professor John Watkins who wrote a memoir of Karl Popper which supported Popper's revisionist view of what had occurred) that initially sparked the interest of the authors.	2003-04-13

On second thoughts, I may have gotten it right the first time just by screaming incoherently.<br />PARASITE is a hard science-fiction story punctuated by people in pain, in agony, and generally not having a pleasant time of it.  It takes place in a gigantic structure called \\"the Artifact\\", large enough to house entire moons.  It's a zero-gee environment, populated by floating forests, detached mountains, and space-monkeys.  The first hundred pages or so are spent just describing and exploring the grand entity, and I found this section to be utterly absorbing.  Mortimore obviously spent a lot of time and energy in coming up with this setting, and I think that investment really paid off.  The plot is virtually at a standstill while the foundations are being laid, but the world-building itself is excellent.<br />Unfortunately, pieces start falling off at about the halfway point.  It becomes too weighty and bloated for its own good; plot threads that had carefully been developed during the beginning and middle sections are promptly dropped, never to appear again.  Many of the items mentioned on the back cover fizzle out long before the resolution of the book.  The preview tells us about \\"a solar system on the brink of civil war\\", but I'm really not sure why this is important.  By the end, some of the large scale of the story comes quite a way towards redeeming the book.  The revelations concerning the gigantic Artifact are genuinely fascinating.  But to use a metaphor: the bottom of the ladder is basically secure; the top of it is similarly sound; however, it's the middle rungs that appear dangerously rickety, and unable to support the weight of the whole.<br />Mortimore creates a lot of interesting characters in this, one suspects purely for the sake of killing them off in a variety of gruesome ways.  I liked many of the secondary characters, especially the strange semi-corporeal character named Midnight, who, unfortunately, I kept visualizing as Strong Sad of Home Star Runner fame.  Not all of them are constructed well, but those that are become quite interesting.  The downside to the writing in general was that as soon as Mortimore started torturing his characters (and he starts early), my interest in them began to wane.  Putting people through the wringer can be a great way of increasing the tension, but doing it too much makes the narrative monotonous.  (And you know the characters are in a lot of pain, because when we see their internal monologues, their grammar starts to break down and they construct extremely long run-on sentences like this one describing their pain, what their pain feels like, what horrors they're experiencing, and, oh, how bad it hurts, and generally repeating how much it hurts, it hurts, oh, it hurts, and the pain, and the agony, and the hurting, oh, my toes, and the pain, oh, oh, and then a bunch of dashes are put in to break up the - agony since the creation of the universe - pain that everyone is going through.  If that sentence irritated you, then you may want to read selected portions of PARASITE with your eyes closed.)<br />And there are lots of little flaws that crop up throughout this book.  Characters make strange leaps of logic, or appear suddenly in places without any indication as to how they got there.  There's an example near the beginning of the book.  Ace and Benny have left the Doctor and the TARDIS behind in a jungle, and they float away towards a distant mountain.  Through a series of misadventures, Benny is injured and left on the mountain while Ace races back to the jungle hoping to obtain some medicine from the TARDIS.  Meanwhile, the Doctor is still in the jungle, running very quickly away from some alien menace that presumably wants to eat him.  While Benny is awaiting Ace's return, the Doctor suddenly appears on the mountain with no explanation as to what happened in the jungle, how he got to the mountain, how he knew she was there, how he managed to pass Ace without seeing her, etc.  Now, is this by itself a major flaw?  No, I can easily imagine a set of circumstances to get the Doctor from point A to point B.  But it's indicative of the book in general.  There's too many of these little quirks and illogical progressions.  Grand ideas, but sloppy in execution.<br />There's a inadvertently accurate summary of PARASITE on page 289: \\"[Benny] had vague memories of panic, of fear, of horror, of great gulping sadness of which, when she looked back on them later, not very many seemed to make a great deal of sense.\\" I wouldn't be as hard on the book as Benny's summary would indicate, but it's not far off from the truth.  I can't say that I liked PARASITE exactly, but I think I feel safe saying that I appreciated some of the Big Ideas that Mortimore was throwing around.  He was thinking big, and I can definitely respect that.  He may not have hit everything he was aiming at, but the things that he was successful at here left me very impressed.  It's a pity that the entire book doesn't feel very cohesive.  It has a rushed flavor to it, which may point to the possibility of the book being better if Mortimore and the editors had taken more care.  There is a hell of a lot of potential here, but only about half of it is fulfilled.lanation as to what happened in the jungle, how he got to the mountain, how he knew she was there, how he managed to pass Ace without seeing her, etc.  Now, is this by itself a major flaw?

US	50631983	R20DYIRFPEPNDH	0426205111	932582598	Beyond the Sun (The New Adventures Series)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	The Edge Of Destruction	I'm not quite sure what to make of BEYOND THE SUN.  At times it feels as though it simply isn't trying very hard, as if it's coasting on a reputation that it hasn't earned.  It's certainly not a bad book; I found myself mostly engrossed in its straightforward plot.  But it has enough flaws in it that I must reserve myself from fully recommending it.  It's fairly unambitious, which isn't a crime unto itself (though personally I do prefer to read about something that's trying to be original), but it constantly seems to think that it's better than it really is.  Its occasional attempts at levity and humor are welcome, though not always successful.  Ultimately, I did enjoy it, but I doubt I'll be rereading this one any time soon.<br />The story is based upon an ancient artifact, a long dead civilization, and a deadly weapon, rumored to have powers beyond the sun.  Professor Bernice Summerfield with the help of two unwitting students must unravel the mystery (and save her ex-husband's hide) before the dangerous secrets fall into the hands of those evil characters who would no doubt unleash deadly horrors upon the universe, as soon as they finish twirling their mustaches and tying Mr. Jason \\"Ex-Hubby\\" Kane to the train-tracks.  The back-cover summary gives the impression of a fairly run-of-the-mill adventure, and to be honest, I found that to be an accurate assessment in many places.  The plot is fairly entertaining, despite its limitations, and there's a satisfying (if not totally unexpected) little twist at the end to give the conclusion a needed shake-up.  <br />I didn't find any of the characters here to be anything to write home about.  They range from those who are adequate and occasionally interesting all the way down to those who are Really Bloody Annoying.  And unfortunately, it's Benny's surrogate companions, Tameka and Emile, who fall into the latter category at most times.  They do have moments where they become tolerable plot devices, but for the majority oftheir scenes, they're just whiney and annoying teenagers.  It's rare for me to actually wish death upon a fictional creation, but when one of the characters appeared to be finally deceased I was actually pleased that I wouldn't have to read any more of their banal observations and dull thoughts.  Imagine my supreme disappointment when that character popped up a few pages later in a distressing state of not-deadness.<br />And the surprising thing about the cardboard characters that do exist is that they are placed side-by-side with an environment and culture that are absolutely fascinating.  Jones managed to pull off something that is usually very difficult to do; create an alien society that thinks and acts differently enough from humans, yet still manages to be logical and believable.  Kudos for that.  Their biology, their background, and thought-processes all make for fascinating reading.  Perhaps Jones made his human characters such shallow creatures to better contrast the alienness of his new creation.  If so, I wish he could have found a less annoying way.<br />Still, BEYOND THE SUN is a good read.  It's not exactly demanding, yet it is enjoyable.  The plot won't blow your mind, but it probably won't bore you either.  The clever way in which Jones paints his alien landscape does make up for some of the failings in other areas.  I didn't love it, but at least I didn't hate it.	2003-03-28
US	50631983	R11LJ9KFXJEG6C	0426204271	240693790	Falls the Shadow (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Springs The Daniel	FALLS THE SHADOW contains almost everything I like to see in a first-time novel, though it also boasts many of the flaws that plague such novice works.  From the first through the last page, there is a breathless collection of enthusiastic ideas that are simply impressive in their depth and their freshness.  By the end, I couldn't help but notice that the story wasn't quite as good as it could have been, yet I would still recommend reading it simply for all the imaginative concepts present.  The book is huge in scope and Daniel O'Mahony lets his imagination run completely wild.  As a whole, it may appear to be slightly undisciplined, but it's an approach that has a lot going for it.<br />The Doctor and company land in a mysterious house where, as expected, Things Are Not Quite What They Seem.  At least, one imagines that they aren't quite what they seem, since it is difficult to describe what it does seem like.  It's a house that wouldn't be out of place in an Escher sketch, with rooms and corridors rearranging themselves, stairways that occasionally stretch off into infinity, and a dank, dark cellar full of strange and horrible things.  Insane experiments are beginning to take place in the house, experiments which are being observed by unearthly visitors.  To say any more would be to wander into spoiler territory, but take my word that it becomes a lot less conventional than the back-cover description would suggest, and a lot stranger.  A whole lot stranger.<br />Some of the thoughts and ideas that constitute this novel almost make it worth reading just by themselves, regardless of anything else that the book succeeds or fails at.  The grey man and his people are a fascinating creation, with the grey man himself earning extra praise for being a staggeringly interesting concept (I love how I managed to view him in a completely different light by the end of the story, even while O'Mahony had kept this character absolutely constant throughout).  Gabriel and Tanith aremarvelous ideas (even if their effectiveness in execution leaves a little to be desired).  The settings used aren't exactly unique, but they gain a lot from the excellent descriptions.  A few items that should feel tired and worn are instead made bright and enjoyable purely from the writer's skills.<br />Above all, FALLS THE SHADOW is a book dripping with atmosphere.  It's not a happy tale, but the depressive nature never feels gratuitous.  It can be a bit overpowering at times, and there may be a few places where the pain and suffering that the characters experience is just a bit too much.  Still, it makes for very absorbing reading.  The revelations surrounding many of the people (one in particular) are mind-bending and fascinating.  They go through hell and back, and I must give a lot of credit for the author managing to make me care about all of the trials and tribulations that he throws at his characters.<br />And, of course, there are certain flaws, many of which are common to first-time novelists.  O'Mahony doesn't quite yet have the knack of moving characters seamlessly around the plot.  Many of the attempts to introduce and/or remove people from the story are clumsily done, and, in particular, the way in which the Doctor is separated from the main action feels far too contrived.  The ending is also a slight problem.  The author has done a great job of making the narrative ease satisfyingly into its conclusion (the last 100 pages or so convey a real sense of impending doom), but not in making the mechanics of the ending seem smooth.  I think the conclusion is logical enough on paper, but it seems a bit of a letdown after the amount of build-up that the reader was subjected to.<br />A flawed work, I still found much to enjoy in FALLS THE SHADOW.  A lot of the little subtleties really work, and many times during the read I would stop and just think about something that the author had presented me with.  Sometimes what I thought about turned out to be a littleshallower than I expected, other times there was indeed some impressive thinking behind the words.  In any case, a book that makes me pause and wonder is definitely a good thing, even if it doesn't hold together completely from cover to cover.  Not a book to be missed.<br />(As an aside, the extended length of this book made me hanker for the days of old when Doctor Who novels were published in the length that they needed to be, regardless of their page count.  FALLS THE SHADOW is 356 pages long, far above the length of the average book in the series.  One imagines that if it were published nowadays, it would contain the same number of words, but they'd be crammed into the 278-page limit via the insanely small text font and margins that made THE ADVENTURESS OF HENRIETTA STREET possible.  I don't know if I'd be able to handle FALLS THE SHADOW written in a font that tiny; my eyes would be suffering as much as the characters in the book.)	2003-03-23
US	50631983	R2PG2IVKHFNJ6A	0061054127	713418185	Magic: The Final Fantasy Collection	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Technically Magic	Like GOLD, the previous &quot;final collection&quot; of Asimov's work from HarperCollins, MAGIC is divided into three separate sections: The Final Fantasy Stories, On Fantasy, and Beyond Fantasy.  As a compilation, I found this to be a decent, if not exactly exciting, read.  Asimov usually isn't a spectacular writer, but he can be an interesting and engaging one.  Even if I didn't fall in love with any of the short pieces presented here, I can't say that I hated any of them either.<br />The first section contains the fictional content, and is made up of eleven short stories relating to the fantasy genre.  Unfortunately, a full eight of these are Asimov's George-and-Azazel tales, which are enjoyable enough, but they dominate the book and are rather formulaic.  An entry from Asimov's Black Widowers mystery series (which certainly would certainly seem to fit more under the mystery genre rather than the fantasy) and a couple of delightful fairy tale stories complete this segment.  The worst charge that could be leveled at any individual story is that it's a bit dull, and the best ones are fun entertainment.  They're amusing diversions, but nothing much more.<br />The second section contains non-fiction, Asimov's thoughts on various aspects of the fantasy genre.  There aren't any earth-shattering revelations, but Asimov had a very enjoyable prose style that quickly and carefully brings his point of view across.  Here he writes about Tolkien, applies scientific knowledge to traditional fairy tales (there's a humorous section where he calculates the speed of Seven League Boots, which strongly reminded me of the &quot;how fast does Santa travel on Christmas Eve?&quot; email that now seems to be a holiday staple), and discusses the origins of the genre and many of its staples.<br />The third section is entitled &quot;Beyond Fantasy&quot;, as presumably the title &quot;Things That Have Nothing To Do With Fantasy But We Wanted To Include Anyway&quot; wouldn't fit on the page.That alternate title fairly accurately describes the contents of this section, as it tackles subjects as far ranging as &quot;Ignorance In America&quot; to evolution to translating ancient texts from their various ancient tongues.  They aren't exactly the sorts of essays that one might expect to find in a fantasy anthology, but they make for fascinating reading all the same.  Asimov's philosophies and beliefs always come across as commonsensical notions that have been explained to you by an expert.  There are only seven short entries in this final group, and I wish there had been more, as I found this to be the most interesting section.  Of course, as mentioned, the majority of these were so unrelated to the main topic that one should probably just be grateful that they were included in the first place.<br />No Asimov-completist's library will be whole without this volume, and even people with little interest in fantasy will probably find a few things to enjoy here.  I read this book while making a transatlantic journey, and it was a great way to fill those deadening hours of airplane travel.  MAGIC isn't a book that demands much from the reader, but it makes for very enjoyable light reading that is still head and shoulders above the average work of most other writers.	2003-03-23
US	50631983	R63CV7I3Y9DOV	0312302584	800097894	Crashing the Party: Taking on the Corporate Government in an Age of Surrender	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Ralph gets his party started	Ralph Nader is the real thing.  For longer than some younger elected officials have been alive, Nader has been the nation's conscience, raising questions about the safety of everyday items to demanding that the government take a greater responsibility towards the well being of all its people and territory.  His book, CRASHING THE PARTY, conveys two separate messages.  First, it's the story of Nader and the Green Party's 2000 Presidential Campaign, based on rejecting both the notion of corporate influence and money on politics, and attempting to establish a genuinely progressive political party.  Second, it's a condemnation of the current political landscape, which currently is motivated, not by the votes of the people, but by the dollars of the wealthiest few.  Democrats and Republicans alike should find much to interest them, though the more partisan amongst them will no doubt find much that they'll find upsetting.<br />It's become increasingly true of late that the Electoral College system in the United States has forced Presidential hopefuls to concentrate their efforts on small numbers of \\"swing states\\" while taking a lot of their key constituencies for granted.  Tellingly, Ralph Nader was the only Presidential Candidate in the 2000 election who actually campaigned all 50 states (and the District of Columbia).  What an idea.  And Nader describes his travels in great detail, pointing out all the issues ignored by the two main parties.  In an amusing aside, Nader posits that the state of airline travel today would be in much better shape if politicians took commercial flights from rally to rally (as Nader did) instead of having their flights chartered.  But mainly the focus is on the poor who, Nader states, are getting poorer, yet are mentioned less and less in political speeches, their voices being lost out to the power of the wealthy, the corporations, and the special interests groups.  Nader's take on how left-wing organizations will react differently to the same actions depending on which party is talking certainly makes for interesting reading, and is probably more than a little disturbing if you happen to be someone who supports one of those concerns.  <br />Worth the price of the book alone is the chapter dealing with Nader's attempts to gain entry to the Presidential Debates.  Having gone through the entire twisted legal process himself as a legitimate third-party candidate, Nader angrily but carefully points out how arbitrary the current system is, where the two major parties get to decide what topics the debates will cover, the number and format of the debates, and, most importantly, who is allowed to participate in the debates.  Not surprisingly, Nader found it very difficult as a third-party candidate to join a club hosted by the two exclusive parties.  His frustration would be laughable if it were not such a serious matter.  The Presidential Debates are the single best way for a candidate to connect with millions of voters, and despite his own efforts (and the polls that clearly stated most Americans being in favor of his and Pat Buchanan's inclusion) it turned out to be a members-only club.  If you don't feel a stir of rage inside of you when reading these sections, then your last name probably rhymes with \\"Gush\\" or \\"Bore\\".<br />To be fair, Nader's prose can often be wooden and repetitive.  He's a little bit too fond of dryly listing names and organizations, and there are places where the writing can get in the way of message.  But what Nader is saying is much more important than how he is saying it.  There may not be a large number of memorable poetic turns of phrase (although he'll surprise you every so often with a striking bit of language), but it's the facts and the reasoning that you'll remember.  And despite the lack of flowery speech, the one thing that does come across is Nader's passion and emotion.  He may not be the most dramatically expressive author in the world, but there is a fiery fervor that burns through his words.<br />Nader offered people a choice in the 2000 elections.  Refusing to give in to the philosophy of voting for the \\"least worst\\" candidate, Nader shows us how this reasoning results in politicians becoming gradually worse rather than progressively better.  He outlines how the failure of the Democratic Party to field viable and broadminded, left-wing candidates has resulted in that party's move towards the center, and helped deliver the Republican Party to its more extreme members.  Nader isn't waiting for the Democrats to move back to their old positions; if they aren't going to rally around those ideals, then he will.<br />CRASHING THE PARTY is not a terribly old book (it's been published and updated fairly recently), but it is already making Ralph Nader look frighteningly prophetic.  With each new piece of breaking news, it seems that everything that Nader has been warning us about has come to pass.  In the Enron scandal, we see the justification for Nader's claims concerning the corruption that goes on when giant corporations are left unchecked.  With the Democrat's historic loses in the 2002 mid-term elections, we see his warnings about what happens when voters are given a choice between two identical candidates.  Read this book to see not only the Green Party's struggle to get some respect, but the scary evidence as to how much influence money plays in the political moves and motivations of the two big parties.	2003-03-08

ST ANTHONY'S FIRE is another one that I read shortly after its release, but which I later remembered virtually nothing about.  Thinking back on this story years later, the most that I could recall was something about a guy torturing a cat, and that there were some sort of gigantic spaceships involved.  So imagine my surprise when I began to reread this story recently, I found myself quite enjoying the beginning.  Unfortunately, this euphoria was not to last.  As the inoffensively entertaining opening began to wear off, I saw less and less to be thrilled by.  By the time I reached the end, I was actively willing the story to end, so that I could move onto something else.  I fully expect that five years from now, if pressed to recall something from this story, the only thing I will be able to add to my list of two vague items above is that there is an absolutely ridiculous religious satire in the novel that I had thankfully wiped from my mind on my initial perusal.<br />The book does begin relatively strong.  There's a war-torn planet in a distant star-system engaged in a genocidal war to the death between two sets of virtually identical aliens.  So far, so good -- not exactly groundbreaking stuff here, but it's told enthusiastically enough to bring my interest along for the ride.  The battle sequences are told with a good bit of flair and revolve around giant reptiles reenacting the trench scenes from PATHS OF GLORY.  But this does bring us to the first place where the book starts to fall apart.  Gatiss goes to a lot of trouble to describe how physically alien these creatures are, and the descriptions of these reptilian people go a long way towards redeeming the book.  But the visual aspects to their alienness are as far as the book develops them, as the way these creatures talk and act make them human for all intents and purposes.  They even use human figures of speech in their everyday conversation.  It almost feels as though Gatiss had finished writing the novel with humans in the lead role, but then went back and made a few cursory changes to the narrative in order to make the monsters seem otherworldly.  There is just too little effort shown though; these aliens just aren't alien.<br />Anyway, as one could guess, the Doctor and Benny (Ace has been left to vacation on another planet) soon arrive and become entangled in the local politics.  Not to get into spoiler territory, but the arrival of what the back-cover blurb describes as \\"an unknown force\\" seems to render inconsequential a lot of the earlier running around.  It's this unknown force that brings the bulk of the unfortunate religious aspect to the story, which drives ST ANTHONY'S FIRE down from being merely an uninspired, unoriginal runaround to the depths of serious Deep Hurting.<br />There's nothing inherently wrong with a good bit of satire, but unfortunately the religious/fundamentalist theme to this story is the least subtle thing this side of that master of understatement, THE GREEN DEATH.  It's as subtle as a bright pink poodle.  As subtle as being hit by a bus.  As subtle as Jim Carrey dressed as a bishop and preaching out of his bottom.  In short, subtlety is not this book's strong point.  The religious persons shown here are all varying shades of evil; some are evil in greedy ways, others are evil in self-preservationist ways, while still others are sadistic purely for the reasons of being sadistic.  The only religious characters who aren't actively evil are just stupid.  I'm would not consider myself a deeply religious person, but this sort of boneheaded sledgehammer moralizing just strikes me as being vapid and lazy.  It's trying to say something profound, but because of its shallow nature, it ends up saying absolutely nothing at all.  <br />The conclusion to the story is simply unsatisfying on almost all levels.  Instead of having the religious satire taken to its logical conclusion of fundamentalism being rejected in favor of some good old-fashioned peace and understanding (or at least something that at least seems aware of the themes that were running through the novel), we get an ending where the forces of the evil religion are defeated by a load of technobabble and people pushing buttons and pulling levels.  The story itself relies on too many information dumps where huge portions of the plot are spelled out by people making long speeches.  It's a pity because there are elements of the plot that were quite interesting, and would have been more effective if introduced in a more engaging way.<br />To be fair, I did like several of the (non-satiric) characters in the novel, and what Gatiss does with Ace I found to be genuinely shocking and disturbing, in a good way.  The Ace subplot is probably something I should have guessed in advance of its revelation, but the author had me completely fooled.  Still, these positives can't save a story that simply doesn't seem to be fully thought through.  The only nice thing left to say about this book is that the cover is quite a good painting, even if the Doctor looks more like a Cardassian than a Time Lord.  Definitely not a memorable or engaging book here.	2003-03-03
US	50631983	R37Z5TT91024GE	0140184929	851296858	Brighton Rock (Twentieth Century Classics)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Brighton Rock Rocks	I enjoyed BRIGHTON ROCK.  I had never read anything that Graham Greene wrote before picking up this volume, and I was very impressed by so many aspects of it.  On the surface, it's simply a gangster story set around the racetrack of a bustling English vacation town in the 1930s.  But there are so many little touches and details that Greene adds that all raise this story up and make it more than just another exciting and gory tale of mob violence.<br />The plot is perhaps the weakest element of the book, but this is not a story that revolves around its plot.  The plot points are merely the catalysts that propel these wonderful characters forward.  We meet Pinkie, a mere seventeen-year-old, who has found himself in the unenviable task of becoming the head of a criminal organization that is embroiled in a power-struggle with an even larger, better-funded gang.  In his world, Pinkie is fighting not only for dominance in his gang, but also battling for territory and control in the town of Brighton.  However, he also encounters a strange conflict from an unlikely source: a fun-loving, cheerful, iron-willed woman by the name of Ida.<br />Ida comes into the story by the most unlikely of coincidences, and is determined to investigate what she feels is a grave injustice.  She plays a great foil to Pinkie's character, even though the two of them rarely meet.  The only downside that I saw to this fascinating person was the fact that after her fantastic introduction she seems to be coasting through the rest of the novel on autopilot.  For a normal book, this would be perfectly expected, but Greene set the bar very high for himself here, especially with this character's motivation, and it just seems a bit jarring when not everything maintains an equal level of excellence.<br />Greene brings in quite a lot of thought to this novel.  Religion, love, spirituality, and death are not things that one expects to undergo detailed analysis on the pages of a crime thriller, yet Greene approaches all of these with maturity and understanding.  Each character (bar a handful) is given believable motivations.  There are some plot pieces that are predictable, but that only means that I was daring the characters not to go the way that they did, and genuinely upset when they did unfortunate things, even though I had anticipated them.  Greene draws on so many ideas to breath life into his novel.  He places familiar concepts into irregular characters, and unfamiliar concepts into regular characters; the results are often wonderful and thought provoking.<br />As I mentioned, I'd not read a Graham Greene novel prior to this, but I certainly plan on doing so in the future.  Greene packed quite a bit of careful thought into this intelligent thriller, and the outcome is as exciting as it is reflective.

At the time, I thought it was a fun adventure that skillfully brought an old villain back to life while telling a fun story.  My recent reread was not quite the same pleasant experience.  Already knowing the plot twists and surprise revelations, I simply found myself getting bored waiting for everyone to just get on with it.  A really great book can be read many times with the lack of surprises not diminishing the overall experience one bit.  But FIRST FRONTIER is not such a book.  With its initial thrills and shocks already known, it simply doesn't have enough else to make itself interesting to read.<br />The setting should have helped things a bit.  It's a story told during the 1950's in the Southwestern US, where vague reports of unidentified flying objects have been rumored and whispered about to this very day.  It would seem an ideal place for a good Doctor Who story, but the book never quite pulls all the potential out of this set-up.  We meet a few of the local townspeople, who should be a colorful collection of down-to-earth folk, but their appearances are too scattered to liven up the narrative.  We encounter the numerous shadowy military and government types who are obligatory in such UFO-centric stories.  They occasionally shine, but more often than not are just dull.  When most of the action switches to Washington, DC, there simply isn't enough time left to establish this new location.  The result is that the new setting fails to stimulate the plot.  The Washington, DC of FIRST FRONTIER feels less like a living, breathing city, and more like a collection of map references.<br />McIntee's prose style is something that I simply cannot get used to.  Individual sentences are constantly extended beyond rhyme or reason.  They're kept on life support by protracted clauses and random punctuation, only to wither and die long past their sell-by date.  I was forced to reread numerous sentences or paragraphs multiple times before I could decipher their meaning.  There's very little that's plainly incorrect, but there's a lot that's just confusing or awkward.  And it's not as if this is a stream-of-consciousness style of novel.  It's just an action-adventure with prose that impedes the reader's progress rather than allowing him or her to speed through the journey.  FIRST FRONTIER is definitely not a book that benefits from having the reader take his time.<br />One of the things I found most distracting was McIntee's tendency to introduce potentially interesting characters, but then to remove them from the action almost immediately.  Rather than letting the story gradually build up around its characters, the book is constantly leaping from location to location, each with it's own supporting cast.  No one is given the opportunity to develop, resulting in characters that, while can't truly be described as one-dimensional, never become more than embryonic.<br />But this book's biggest stumbling block is the lackluster plot that all the characters are slowly stumbling through.  There's so little for the Doctor to do, that he disappears for long stretches of time and nothing changes during his absence.  In other Doctor-light New Adventures, at least one could feel the Doctor's presence even when he wasn't on center-stage.  Not so here.  But at least this gives us the chance to see the companions shine, right?  Well, sort of.  Benny and Ace are certainly there, and they're occasionally well characterized, but they, like everyone else, have nothing much to do.<br />I will say something positive about the book though, and that is that I did like the alien race created here.  The Tzun have obviously been thought through very carefully, as there is quite a lot of detail about their various factions, denominations and beliefs.  I appreciate an author who puts time and energy into inventing a believable alien race instead of just making them humans in rubber suits.  The only quibble I have on this part of FIRST FRONTIER was the fact that most of the Tzuns' philosophies are saved to the end, rather than having them sprinkled throughout the text.  Keeping everything back meant that they seemed to suddenly gain a dimension at the end instead of appearing multi-layered at all times.  But, still, the effort was there, and I did appreciate that.<br />All in all, there are just too many pointless action sequences for me to care much about any of them.  The fight sequences in FIRST FRONTIER are those type that you can skip to the end, figure out which side won, and not have missed anything important.  It's the typical sort of stuff.  Guns blazing.  Fists punching.  Things exploding.  Me yawning.	2003-02-15
US	50631983	R1O5KJSY612KL5	0426204190	771429968	Strange England (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Strange and Stranger	If I didn't know better, I'd swear that Simon Messingham's only experience of Doctor Who came through the collected works of Marc Platt.  Indeed, STRANGE ENGLAND at times feels like a greatest hits tour of some of Platt's previous efforts.  This gives the story a very unoriginal feeling to it, yet it adds a much-needed layer of oddness and surrealism to a story that has a very simple heart.<br />The book begins innocently enough.  The Doctor, Ace and Benny land during what appears to be a typical English summer's day.  The birds are singing; the foliage is lush and green.  It seems like an ideal place for this TARDIS crew to settle down and have a nice picnic for three hundred pages or so.  Of course, it won't come as a huge surprise when very early on it turns out that Things Aren't Quite What They Seem.  A strange, unearthly insect stalks the characters.  The inhabitants of the house appear to be human, but their behavior doesn't seem quite right to the TARDIS crew.  The entire environment quickly descends into insanity, with illogical events surprising both the regulars and the people who live there.<br />The characters are highly varied in their execution.  A few of them are one-dimensional, and there's a villain with such a clichéd disposition (he's stark raving mad) that one wonders if he was supposed to be some sort of hilarious meta-textual joke gone bad.  Yet, strangely enough, I did enjoy reading that character's rantings, as Messingham manages to take a fairly cardboard concept and make it interesting.  His own characters, Messingham mostly succeeds at drawing, with only one or two who become tiresome.  But the Doctor, Benny and Ace are a completely different story.  They get split up fairly early on, which is an absurdly good thing because whenever they're together they turn into the most one-dimensional characters imaginable.  It's quite an odd effect really.  At the beginning of the story, they are absolutely awful together, bouncing silly and banal dialog off of each other.  But as soon as they're apart, they become almost realistic.  When interacting with Messingham's secondary characters they have an individual nature and are recognizable.  Yet as soon as the end of the story begins to roll around, the three are reunited and the awfulness of their interacting in the beginning is back.  It's as if Messingham understood the characters enough to have them mingle with normal people, but not enough to have to play their characteristics off of each other.<br />As I said, the final product we see here is what would happen if you put Marc Platt and some fairly bland padding into a Markov chain generator.  Scraps of inspiration and portions that seem familiar are spaced out by material that just doesn't draw the disparate pieces together.  To begin with, there's a mysterious and peculiar house sitting in an environment where the time-stream seems to be racing around in odd ways.  Various nouns and verbs receive capitalization, just so we know how important they are: House, Control, Assimilator, etc.  Many of the concepts and themes kept reminding me of GHOST-LIGHT and CAT'S CRADLE: TIME'S CRUCIBLE.  Although I don't wish to get into spoiler territory, I'll just say that the eventual explanation for the odd happenings should seem very familiar to fans of Marc Platt.<br />The writing itself is fairly variable, though overall it's not bad at all.  While I've already commented on the strengths and weaknesses of the characters, I found that the prose itself was fairly decent, if nothing to jump up and down about.  The story does attempt to counterpoint some incredibly idyllic scenes with ones that are extremely gritty and occasionally quite violent.  Indeed, I found myself wincing during a few sections, although nothing felt unduly gratuitous.<br />As the story progresses, Messingham keeps upping the amount of surreal imagery and bizarre situations.  While this kept the story interesting, there is a real danger here for any writer.  Make the story seem too unrealistic or strange, and the audience simply won't care what happens to the characters because it can lead to a feeling of insignificance (i.e., at some point we just stop caring because we're subconsciously waiting for the &quot;it was all a dream&quot; type of revelation).  Messingham did fall foul of this on a small number of occasions, but more often than not he stayed on the right side of that line.<br />It's fairly unoriginal, and despite a lot of seemingly highbrow concepts and questions, it doesn't really carry the weight that it wants to.  There is an enormous amount of padding between the set-up and the resolution, though fortunately much of that padding is fairly interesting.  On the other hand, there's much of it that comes across as faintly boring.  I did like the fact that it dared to ask quite a few questions about some of our basic assumptions about the Doctor and his adventures; the downside being that not all of the examinations were fully explored.  But, I would argue that despite its flaws, STRANGE ENGLAND is worth reading, even if it isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is.	2003-02-08
US	50631983	R33AHM3RI5NL7Q	0140254560	54350484	Orson Welles, Volume 1: The Road to Xanadu (Orson Welles / Simon Callow)	Books	5	39	39	N	N	The American	Simon Callow's thick and detailed biography of Orson Welles is a staggeringly thorough account of the actor/director's life, from his birth up until the release of his most famous picture, CITIZEN KANE.  Callow goes to great lengths to separate the man from his inhumanly grandiose reputation.  Armed with years of research, his personal interviews, and a keen sense of humor, Callow sets off to discover the real early life of Orson Welles.  He finds a man smaller than his gargantuan myth, yet fascinating and brilliant all the same.<br />Orson Welles is a notoriously difficult man to write about with any great degree of accuracy.  This is attributable to the fact that Welles seems to have spent almost as much time publicizing his work as he spent creating.  The difficulty arises when one realizes that the majority of what he said wasn't strictly accurate, and yet it's that publicity which has been accepted for many years.  Not to say that Welles was lying, or making up facts (at least, not all the time).  It would be closer to the truth to say that Welles was prone to exaggerations, sometimes wild ones when it concerned himself.  For the sake of his image, and for the sake of his career, he would embellish and overstate what he was doing and what he had done.  Some of the more hysterical (and insightful) portions of the book are those where we see Welles describing something that had occurred several chapters previous.  The story that gets told later can be almost totally at odds to what the actuality of the situation was.  The further on one goes into the book, the farther away from reality these descriptions become.  Welles was obsessed with constantly reinventing himself, creating a gigantic legend that became increasingly difficult for any mortal man to live up to.<br />This is not to say that Simon Callow is merely running down Orson Welles, or making his achievements seem unworthy.  Indeed, Callow appears genuinely impressed by what Welles achieved in such a short amount of time.  While Welles apparently preferred his fantasy image of himself, the truth was quite remarkable by itself; Welles packed more living into his first twenty-five years than most people do in a lifetime.  The respect that he commanded as an actor/director was unprecedented for someone of his young age.  But Callow emphasizes with how Welles thought of himself.  He sees Welles' drive to continually achieve more.  As a fellow actor, Callow understands and relates to the need for constantly promoting oneself for the benefit of one's career.  He compares events in Welles' later life to the man's childhood, looking for the reasons for the overriding desire to drive farther and faster.<br />The book does tend to take slight detours on its road to CITIZEN KANE's Xanadu.  Many of the subjects tangentially related to the main feature are given adequate descriptions.  Welles' parents, his hometown of Kenosha, Wisconsin, the state of the American theatre in the 1930s and other assorted topics all benefit from Callow's in-depth research and his wonderful attention to detail.  These asides and tangents are vital to understanding Welles in his context, and this biography is much the richer for these additions.<br />As for the portions of Welles' early life that Callow chooses to focus on, it is Welles' theatre work that receives the lion's share of attention.  These sections are remarkably detailed, and I simply cannot imagine the book containing any more information.  All of his productions are covered, the bulk of the spotlight being aimed towards those plays that Welles approached as both director and actor.  Numerous memorable stories are contained in these sections, one of my favorites being the description of Welles directing a collapsing production by punctuating his screams at the cast with intermittent swigs straight from his omnipresent bottle of bourbon.<br />Descriptions of Orson Welles' other endeavors can only pale by comparison, though they themselves are also covered meticulously.  The portions dealing with his radio career aren't given nearly the same attention, and the chapter involved with his WAR OF THE WORLDS broadcast seems remarkably brief given how big a place it holds in the Welles Legend.  On the other hand, Callow is quick to point out how little input Welles had in the writing side of that radio play, so in retrospect it shouldn't really be all that surprising to see it neglected here.  Still, even Welles' work as The Shadow is only briefly mentioned; again, probably based on Welles' lack of creative input on that series.  However, it would have been interesting to see the same flurry of facts, and anecdotes directed towards the radio and film work as it was towards the stage.<br />For anyone who is slightly curious as to actor Simon Callow's ability to write, let me put your mind at ease.  Not only is Callow a competent writer, but he's a very engaging one.  The subject of Orson Welles is not a simple one for any biographer to attempt, yet Callow has put together a superbly researched and diabolically entertaining portrait of a man who surrounded himself with so much misinformation that sorting through it all must have been an exhausting task.  Callow himself is never far from his descriptions, injecting his wry sense of humor into numerous observations.  His style of writing makes it very clear when he's talking about verifiable facts, or when he is basing something on conjuncture.  Further to this, there are twenty-five pages of references, as well as two and a half pages of bibliography.  This is both a lively read and a superbly researched book --a rarity, but an extremely welcome one.  In the preface, Simon Callow states that this is merely the first book of two and the second will deal with Welles' descent from the peak of his career.  That second book has yet to be published, but based on the extraordinary achievement of this volume, it should be well worth the wait.	2003-02-03
US	50631983	R2H2JPE35GUID7	056353866X	128664368	Time Zero (Doctor Who)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Multi-threaded	Justin Richards usually treats us to a story with a carefully constructed, logical structure containing few thrills but enough plot twists to keep the reader involved.  TIME ZERO continued his reputation in this manner and delighted me in many ways.  Primarily a fun-filled action-adventure, the book has enough little extra touches and flourishes to pull it firmly above the bounds of mediocrity.  <br />The back of the book tells us that Fitz has gone to his certain death, and that Anji has resumed her normal life and job.  The most memorable sequences deal with those two companions, and in particular I very much enjoyed the chain of events that lead Anji back into the Doctor's company.  In a series that at times recently has seemed to be more plot-based than character-driven (with a handful of notable exceptions), it's reassuring to see that the editor has a firm grasp of his major characters and is more than willing to let these characters control vast quantities of his own book.<br />The plot, as mentioned, is pure Richardsian logic, although there were one or two stretches that went a bit too far for the sake of plausibility.  Of course, it was great fun seeing such varyingly different plot strands binding together to eventually form a single cohesive story.  Fitz's Siberian expedition, Anji's reclamation of her life, the Earth exploration into time travel technologies, the research scientists' discoveries, and the Doctor's own investigations are intergraded together carefully and the numerous storylines make for an intriguing mystery.<br />On the down side, there are several action sequences that aren't quite as exciting as they should be; the tense drama comes from the scenes directly before or after them as the various characters discuss and reflect on their fate.  This isn't wholly a bad thing, yet obviously I couldn't help but think that having everything running smoothly rather than having breaks for the physical conflicts would be better.  Picky, I know, but I am usually bored by fight sequences in Doctor Who books, and while the ones in TIME ZERO were better than most, they were nowhere near to being my favorite parts of the book.  At best they were acceptable, though the stress they put the characters through made them worthwhile.  <br />The story may be slightly confusing in places and require a bit of flipping back to previous pages in order to work everything out, but I quite enjoyed the finished product.  I almost always have a lot of fun following Justin Richards plots to their conclusions and TIME ZERO is certainly not an exception to that rule.  This book seems to be setting up some conflicts and storylines that will have far-reaching effects upon the future of the series.  A few of the Doctor's speeches on those subjects echo PDE's afterword to DECEIT and I found myself digging up my copy of that NA to spot the parallels to that previous editor's understanding of the Doctor Who universe.  Event novel, or not, TIME ZERO delivers the goods.	2003-01-21
US	50631983	R1Q88QP7GXL78N	3829005210	553338023	The 1940s (Decades of the 20th Century)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Each one is worth much more than a thousand words	In a decade dominated by war, the majority of these 1940s photographs are also primarily concerned with that conflict.  The first four chapters (out of eleven) deal exclusively with that topic, and World War II also features heavily in some of the later sections.  It's an interesting collection of photographs, being a mixture of professional photographers documenting historic events and snapshots taken by ordinary people of commonplace items that are notable now purely for their vintage quality.<br />The photos that do chronicle the Second World War are outstanding, though those few that detail the various atrocities can make for difficult viewing.  Pictures of bravery and heroics sit side by side with images of pure human suffering.  Sacrifices at home are shown next to the work being done abroad.  This is a well-done summation of those war years in all their different facets.<br />War is not the only subject catered to in this collection.  Sports, fashion, show business, and other events of the post-war years are dealt with.  Several celebrities of the day make cameos on these pages, but the primary focus is upon the regular people going about their everyday business; the entertainers are confined to making moral boosting visits to overseas troops.  A selection of delightfully goofy pictures is a welcome change from some of the weightier offerings.  Seeing Miss Italy knocking out Miss England, Ingrid Bergman chuckling at Alfred Hitchcock, or a Russian solder dancing with an American serviceman is a great antidote to the more depressing and destructive scenes.<br />The black and white photography here offers us a great insight into the way of life during the 1940s.  Each photograph is captioned in English, German and French, but it's not those few words that will be sticking in your memory.  There are some unforgettable images that have been captured here.  They were stored for decades in plastic and glass, but many of them will now be imprinted in the minds of anyone who peruses this picture book.  The photographs here are priceless.	2003-01-20
US	50631983	RH6MTXSCCF6ZL	074900536X	627147583	All the Rage	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	The Enjoyable Tale of Dancing Queens	The story of ALL THE RAGE is actually two tales in one.  The first story concerns the rise and fall of a manufactured pop group in the '80s with the uninspired name of Things Fall Apart.  A band appealing to pre-pubescents and teenyboppers, and a certified flop in the Eurovision Song Contest, they ride their UK popularity for all it's worth, going through good and bad patches while maintaining a complicated set of personal relationships with each other, their families and their manager.  The second story is the account of their attempted reunion many years later.  Told in alternating chapters to the first part, this relates the characters long after the band has broken up, and shows their lives after they've drifted out of the collective memory of their nation.<br />A plot summary of ALL THE RAGE may certainly give the reader the impression that this is a silly and fluffy narrative.  In many ways, this accurately describes a lot of the book.  Yet such an account misses much of the heart and soul of this story.  It isn't just the adventures of a tacky, glossy (and probably terrible) boy-girl band; it's also the story of their lives, loves and frustrations.  Paul Magrs is borrowing a lot of the clichés concerning what we know of the music industry, but he's using these clichés to tell a very human story.<br />One could probably guess at the identities of the band's complement.  There's the member of the band who thinks he's a real musician, the member who thinks that her lyrics are God's gift to pop culture, the member who's already got her sights on a post-band career, and the member who's only in the group to keep the real talent stable.  On the whole, there's something really [sad] about most of the people here, but Magrs isn't just into kicking people when they're down.  Despite their lack of actual ability, they do retain a certain dignity.  Their struggles are real and matter to them, and that translates well to the reader who does have the advantage being able to see the bigger picture.  We can see them in a way that they can't and this benefit allows us to see the individuals up close.  <br />On the other hand, not everything was as successful as it could have been.  The second portion of the story (the attempted reunion) is narrated by a character who was only a child at the time of Thing Fall Apart's heyday.  While he played a crucial role at the beginning, his need to appear dwindles to the point where even the character is starting to wonder what he's doing there.  The ending just had too many things going on, and with the sudden numerical expansion of important characters in the final chapters, there are too many people who don't quite seem to have a fully reasoned motivation for being there.  The insertion of several characters from the beginning seemed an artificial way of keeping certain people occupied in the plot, but I just don't think it was executed particularly well.  As a result the overall conclusion does seem a bit rushed in placed, although the final sequence is an absolutely joy to behold as well as being a complete surprise.  Fortunately, the haste in which the book closes by no means lessens the rest of the story.<br />Now, despite the silliness and human drama that I've been discussing, this book is also killingly funny.  The story is told with a lot of wit and humor, while containing numerous entertaining characters.  Their manager, a gigantic, enraged transvestite (who seemed to grow more massive as the story progressed), is one of the more unforgettable characters that I've read recently, and every line of his dialog had me rolling on the floor with laughter.  Other characters are also quite amusing, and virtually all of the scenes are related with a great deal of panache.  Magrs' prose style suits this sort of story wonderfully; on the surface it's warm and fuzzy, but underneath one can see something more substantial and sinister lurking.<br />Despite its apparently frivolous nature, ALL THE RAGE is really a clever and witty story.  Split into two related stories, I quite enjoyed seeing the echoes of one narrative flow into portions of the other.  Occasionally thought provoking, and never short of entertaining, ALL THE RAGE comes recommended.	2003-01-07
US	50631983	R1SFMQ1HZHA0D0	0426204158	458501537	All-Consuming Fire (Doctor Who-The New Adventures)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Elementary, my dear Benny	What an idea.  Putting Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and chunks of the Lovecraft universe into a Doctor Who book is a concept that seems ripe for disaster.  Too many incompatibilities, too many elements to draw on, and a question of where the focus should be.  And yet ALL-CONSUMING FIRE manages to be one of my favorite NAs despite the handful of minor flaws that appear.  Holmes and Watson are effortlessly inserted into an imaginative Doctor Who story, giving the book a unique flavor.  It's a dark and occasionally grim story, but strangely enough it somehow succeeds at being a whole lot of fun.<br />The tale starts in typical Holmesian fashion.  During the beginning, Watson gets to play second fiddle while Holmes makes several detailed (though irrelevant) observations and deductions purely to demonstrate how clever he is.  This sort of thing will be very familiar to fans of the Sherlock Holmes stories.  Their involvement in this case begins with an important client hiring them to discover the whereabouts of several books that have been stolen from a strange and secretive library.  During the course of their investigation, their travels intersect with the path of that mysterious and eccentric gentleman -- the Doctor (portrayed here as alternatively goofy and cynical).  The two fictional juggernauts actually interact quite well.  I was hugely entertained by their initial meetings; there's a very amusing sequence in which Holmes is totally unable to determine much of the Doctor's origins from telltale bits of dust and dirt.  What could have gone so poorly ends up feeling really right.<br />The trail leads them first to India, and then to an alien world known as Ry'leh.  The reactions of the two Victorians as their surroundings become more and more bizarre are handled realistically (or as realistically as possible) without being over the top.  The conclusion to the story is satisfying, though the book suffers from having a beginning that is so wonderful that even an extraordinary ending would seem vaguely inadequate.<br />The story is told primarily from the journals/diaries of Dr. John Watson and Professor Bernice Summerfield.  Andy Lane is excellent at recreating Arthur Conan Doyle's prose style without appearing to be doing a mere cut'n'paste job.  The process of the investigation of missing books is very much in keeping with the flavor of the Holmes stories.  The Library of St. John The Beheaded is a fantastic creation, and its description is pure Holmesian.  A wonderful combination of concepts and prose.<br />The Lovecraftian additions near the conclusion are not quite as well handled as the Holmes portions.  I am, of course, not the first reviewer to note this, and I'm afraid that I cannot break with conventional thinking here.  Lovecraft succeeded by keeping his baddies just out of the corner of one's eye, where one wasn't quite sure what was there or what was going on.  While this story does eventually come up with a good reason why it's breaking with the formula, the explanation doesn't make up for the fact that it simply isn't executed as pleasingly.  This portion at times seems as if it was hastily bolted on to the main plot.  Apart from some fairly superficial name-checks, the Lovecraft villains could have been almost any great evil.<br />The first time I read this book, I did feel that Holmes was horribly underused during the later series of events.  While rereading the story, I was mentally prepared for this, and to my surprise, Lane didn't quite sideline Holmes as much as I had remembered.  The great detective certainly doesn't have the same forceful impact on the story that he does in the beginning, but my memory had only retained the portions dealing with his shock and bewilderment.  There are in fact several moments where Holmes does arrive at plot-advancing conclusions despite his unfamiliarity with the environment.  On the other hand, Benny does seem to enjoy taking the mickey out of the famous sleuth at times andwhile those who take the detective very seriously may not be entirely pleased with that approach, I couldn't help but giggle.  A slight mocking of Sherlock Holmes, perhaps, but one that allows him to come through the story with his dignity intact.<br />There are just too many little things that the book does well to mention them all.  I was greatly amused by Watson's infatuation with Benny, perfectly in keeping with his enchantment for seemingly all of his female clients.  The descriptions of the Holmes style of Victorian London are excellent.  The delightful puns and jokes in the chapter titles are delightful, and had me flipping back to the beginning of the chapter after I had read it in order to get the joke.  Too many fun things to recommend about this one.	2002-12-29
US	50631983	R1LPU6LU415IKE	0563538570	258688632	Camera Obscura (Doctor Who)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	What a ride...	CAMERA OBSCURA is a very good novel.  It's not as good as Lloyd Rose's previous offering, CITY OF THE DEAD, as it lacks that story's rich attention to detail.  On the other hand, while it may be lacking overall in comparison, it has some brilliant individual sequences that surpass the first book, and rival anything seen so far in Doctor Who book fiction.  It has a few problems, but what the book does well more than outweighs the novel's few missteps.<br />I found many passages in CAMERA OBSCURA to be completely riveting, surprising and fantastic.  There are sequences in which it is absolutely impossible for the reader to attempt to put down the book.  And yet (and I do feel a little greedy for complaining about this) I'm not quite sure that the book flowed as well as it could have.  Loads of the individual set pieces are amazing, but the glue holding them all together just feels a little lacking.  Instead of the portions combining together to a gigantic crescendo at the conclusion, it seemed as though the book was forever starting and stopping, without really building on any of the brilliance.  Again, this does feel a little unfair of me, because those standout pieces are indeed fantastic, but overall I couldn't help but believe that the sum was just a tiny bit less than all of the parts, given how wonderful some of those parts were.<br />As for what those wonderful parts were.  Well, there are some absolutely fantastic sections of prose here.  Chapter Twenty (the Doctor's decent) is as magical as anything I've ever read in Doctor Who.  The Doctor's conversations with Sabbath, while occasionally coming across as gimmicky, are nevertheless penetrating in their insight as to how the two men see their place in the universe.  The setting adds a lot to the story, although it doesn't feel quite as overwhelming as the New Orleans of CITY OF THE DEAD did.  The carnival sequences work, not only because of their description, but, more importantly, because of the way the outlandish freaks and geeks react to the Doctor.  <br />The humor in this story is something that I haven't seen much written about, but there were a handful of sequences that had me laughing out loud, and that's a wonderful thing that happens all too infrequently in Doctor Who books.  Overall, this is a really good book that comes recommended.  Comparisons to Rose's previous book are no doubt inevitable, and while I found CAMERA OBSCURA to be vaguely lacking in contrast, that doesn't take away from the book at hand.  Occasionally magical, and never less than enthralling, its minor flaws don't stop this from being a required read.	2002-12-23

If the word 'magical' didn't exist, we would have to invent it in order to properly describe Ray Bradbury's DANDELION WINE.  The premise is absurdly simple: one summer in a small Midwestern town during the late 1920's.  On the surface it doesn't look like a lot to hang a novel on, but Bradbury puts so much heart, soul and, yes, love into his words that I defy anyone to call it an empty book.  Bradbury has always written superbly for children, and slipping his characters into his own nostalgic childhood succeeds on virtually every level.<br />I've always preferred Bradbury's short stories to his full novels, yet here he successfully manages to have his cake and eat it too.  Most of the chapters are self-contained little story segments.  In fact, I had come across portions of this book in short story collections, and had no idea that they were smaller parts of a larger work.   Yet DANDELION WINE is much more than just a collection of stories.  The children and adults alike grow and change as the summer days burn and then fade.  Just like a real season, some events are disconnected from the rest and can involve seldom seen people, while other proceedings are intrinsically linked to their peers.  <br />The book itself is fairly difficult to sum up; every definition that I've tried coming up with has omitted several major elements.  Of course, any summary that tried to include everything would be far too long and would contain none of the magic of the text.  Children discover some fundamental and universal truths for the first time.  Adults deal with their own fears and their own nightmares.  And, of course, there are the usual wonderful collection of Bradbury eccentrics and strangers.  Children are filled with awe and recognizably childlike without being annoying or unrealistic.  There really are too many great little moments in this book to go into huge amounts of detail.  To mention a handful of great things is to omit the other wonderful moments.  Just likemost perfect summers, the book isn't great because of one or two gigantic epics, but because of small quiet little days.  From the silent thrill of feeling the grass beneath one's feet to the heartbreak at finding a lover at a point far too late in life, DANDELION WINE contains a huge amount of diversity under the cohesive umbrella of a typical summer.  Two disparate events can be quite different in both content and feel, but Bradbury is more than talented enough to make them both feel like part of the same summer.<br />DANDELION WINE has a passion for childlike exuberance and the wonder of first discoveries all wrapped up in a healthy portion of nostalgic longing.  This book is really a series of parts, but manages to add up to more than their sum.  Like individual summer days, they can be appealing on their own, but taken as a whole the result is magical.	2002-12-16

Bjarne Stroustrup's THE C++ PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE is ideal for those potential buyers who already know 75% of what is written in the book.  But please note that this is not necessarily a put-down or a bad thing.  This book is reference material for people who are already familiar with the concepts and syntax of C++.  If you're looking to learn C++ from scratch, then run far and run quickly away from this book.  On the other hand, if you're an experienced coder who's looking to remember specific details, or an intermediate who's looking for some nitty-gritty information, then this is a highly recommended reference book.<br />The writing is meticulous and often obscure.  But Stroustrup packs in a lot of detail into every page.  The example code is short and to the point.  He assumes that if you don't get what he's talking about the first time, then further examples aren't going to help; and most of the time this assumption is justified, as his terse code manages to convey everything that it needs to.<br />You really do need to have experience with C++ to understand a lot of his examples though, as often he will casually mention a concept or function that he won't get around to defining for another few hundred pages.  After all, most of the features in C++ interact heavily with other functions, so it's not really possible to explain some things without explaining their relationships (even if they are relating to things that the text has not yet brought up).  But, as I said, this is reference material, and such conventions are allowable and, at times, encouraged.  I am much happier with a book like this that gives me all of the detail necessary than an introductory book that would only offer simplistic explanations in the beginning while holding out for the details towards the end.<br />The book covers virtually every major aspect of the C++ programming language.  While everything is richly explained, I find the sections on the standard containers and their iterators tobe particularly enlightening.  There is a lot of overlap inherent in these concepts, but each individual portion is clearly and unambiguously explained.  The sections on pointers, classes, and inheritance are similarly helpful.  But, to be honest, there is no reason for me to list everything that the book explains, because it literally contains everything; if it's not in the book, then in all likelihood it's not in the language either.<br />THE C++ PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE is a dense book and is packed to the gills with invaluable information and a fair bit of insight.  As the inventor of the C++ language itself, Stroustrup is the closest person to the actual syntax, and short of reading the ISO spec, you simply won't find a more comprehensive tome on the subject.  Remember, if you're a beginner, stay away.  If you're experienced or you plan on being so, then you need to own this book today.	2002-12-12
US	50631983	R4PHUJG5R9JLZ	042620414X	81177750	Theatre of War (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Way Things Ought To Be	THEATRE OF WAR was a book that presented me with a dilemma.  I wanted to read it slowly, to absorb all of the rich detail that Justin Richards provided me with.  But I had a real hard time doing this, because I had an equal and opposite desire to race through the book quickly, so I could see exactly how the plot unfolded.<br />The outline for this story must have been very detailed indeed.  The book is very much driven by its plot, and the twists and turns are all quite welcome.  Some of the directions I anticipated, but many of them took me completely by surprise.  I love plot twists that are surprising but logical, and THEATRE OF WAR definitely delivers those.  <br />Not only is the plot exciting and captivating, but there are loads of small little things that combine to make this a special book.  I loved all of the extracts from made-up references books.  I adored the clever play within a play passages with their meta-textual jokes about various Doctor Who stories, existent and missing.  And seeing Benny in archeology mode was fantastic and something that had been lacking in previous books.  It seems strange to think that it took this long to get a book that made such perfect use of Benny's diary, her background in archeology and her past in general.<br />The story makes good use of its many characters and settings.  The archeological dig was a great place for Benny to develop and yet again she has the ability to drive a story forward all by herself.  The secondary characters aren't terribly deep, but they all have a quality of believability.  It's only near the end that one or two of them turn stereotypical, and by that point it's a forgivable sin.  <br />There was only one real problem that I had with the plot.  While the majority of the hints to the central mystery are carefully hidden, there is a huge clue in the introduction that is so massive that it reveals the way the plot is going to unfold over the next two hundred pages.  Now, to be fair to the book, given some of themes that had been running through the story, this was no doubt done on purpose with the hope that the reader wouldn't really pick up on the clue.  And even with the mystery somewhat deflated, I was still enthralled watching Benny and the Doctor work their way to the \\"how\\" and \\"why\\", even if I had already figured out the \\"what\\".<br />THEATRE OF WAR introduces several things that would later play larger roles in the NA universe, Irving Braxiatel and his collection included.  However, this also works as a carefully written and enjoyable standalone novel.  Its action-adventure status is enhanced by both its close attention to detail and Justin Richards' ability to keep a book filled with surprises.  If you want to know why the New Adventures were so popular and why they attracted such a loyal and devoted following, then you merely have to read this book to discover what thousands of other Doctor Who fans were enjoying every month.<br />(On the subject of the cover.  If the DECEIT cover featured giant rocks about to sneeze, then the THEATRE OF WAR cover shows what happens when giant rocks forget to pack their tissues.  Eww.)	2002-12-02
US	50631983	R3D5G49NLL5IX0	0679769781	831998889	We're Right, They're Wrong: A Handbook for Spirited Progressives	Books	4	24	29	N	N	He's bald and pointing at *you*!	James Carville points an accusatory finger on the cover of his book, WE'RE RIGHT AND THEY'RE WRONG, and then spends under two hundred pages setting out to prove his point.  Contained in this slim volume are a lot of witticisms, common sense observations, and some devastating facts and figures that he brings out in support of his philosophies.  You may not agree with what he says in the book, but you can't deny the power of his passion and the clarity of his thoughts.<br />Carville has a folksy commonsensical writing style.  He throws in numerous references to his childhood and family in Louisiana.  One of his philosophies that he attributes to his Cajun mother is the idea of the &quot;5/65 Democrats&quot;. She espoused the idea that there are only two important activities that a person should be engaged in between the ages of five and sixty-five - either having a job, or training for a job.  Carville revisits this idea many times after its introduction, effectively using it to counter right-wing assertions that government programs encourage laziness and inefficiency.  He repeatedly points out that helping people find jobs and giving them access to training are the two things he finds to be of paramount importance.  He angrily dismisses the arguments of cutting education and training programs in order to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.<br />Although the book was written to coincide with the 1996 Presidential and Congressional Elections, there is still plenty of relevant material here.  Carville's responses to Republican's plans such as school vouchers, the flat tax, &quot;big government&quot; and others still resonate today.  And some of the passages that have dated are still interesting to read about in a purely historical sense.  Although the Clinton Health Care package will never see the light of day, Carville's defense of it makes for fascinating reading.  He also dedicates numerous pages to all of the liberal programs that have been opposed by conservatives but which have definitely proved their worth.  He defends the programs, pokes holes in the arguments of their detractors and offers suggestions for improvement.  With many political books devoted purely to pointing out mistakes and foibles, it's reassuring to read someone defending ideas that have been helpful and effective.<br />As the title suggests, Carville divides the book fairly evenly between defending the left-wing concepts that have merit and attacking the right-wing ideas that are flawed.  It's a balanced approach.  And, thankfully, Carville spends the required amount of time needed to site his sources.  Fourteen pages are reserved merely for Carville to name exactly where he is taking his statistics, quotes and facts.  This is an invaluable service; if you want to look up these things for yourself, you only have to search.<br />It's a pity that the people who would learn the most from this book are the ones who are least likely to read it, either though disagreement with Carville's previous statements, or just a disinterest in politics.  The writing style is simple and straightforward enough not to alienate any political novices, while containing enough meat to satisfy the political junkies in the audience.  The Ragin' Cajun served up a winner.	2002-12-02
US	50631983	R1EVX4A1LCK9K0	0426204123	436891652	Legacy (Doctor Who-The New Adventures)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Leg-a-he-he-he...	For the first twenty-four pages of LEGACY, I was really enjoying myself.  Gary Russell opens with a short history of the planet Peladon, fleshing out a lot of background that had merely been hinted at during the first two Doctor Who stories to use that setting.  This was quite entertaining and it had me completely captivated.<br />Then I started reading page twenty-five.<br />While the opening had used its continuity references as building blocks for the story, what immediately followed was an unrestrained and pointless gallivant through Doctor Who stories too numerous to count.  The references during that opening were necessary, but not off-putting.  I hadn't watched the previous Peladon stories in quite some time, but I didn't feel as though I couldn't follow the story because of the referencing.  But I simply can't imagine what someone who without an encyclopedic knowledge of Doctor Who stories would make of some of these.  I kept waiting for the book to regain the momentum that it possessed during the beginning, but it simply never did.  Portions of it were enjoyable, but between the overburdening continuity references, minor sloppy plotting, and strangely worded sections of prose, there was just too much carelessness for me to really enjoy this book.<br />If the story outline of LEGACY had been written to its absolute fullest potential, then the book would have been a fairly average and non-demanding action adventure.  But there are just too many little things dragging it below what it could have been.  Pointless and gratuitous continuity references abound, and rather than enhancing the story, more often than not they are distracting and silly.  There are several passages that would have seemed poor in a first draft, yet somehow made it through to the final manuscript.  For example, someone is going to have to explain to me how Alpha Centauri (who's entire skull is a gigantic eye socket - he has the biggest eye in Doctor Who history) could possibly not identifyan assailant that was standing directly in front of him.  And Ace is relegated to a pointless and boring subplot that, despite what the narrative actually comes out and tells us, does not have any impact on the main story.  Just too many minor things spoil this average adventure.<br />The pulpy action-adventure clichés actually work part of the time.  But for every sentence that can be read with a knowing smirk, there's another one that appears with a groan.  Still, I found myself somewhat enjoying the simplicity of the plot even though the book really seemed to be daring me to like it.  Despite the flimsiness of the storyline, and the shallowness of the characters, I kept finding little pieces to enjoy.  To put it another way, while at the end of the day I still can't say it was a good book, there were enough little moments to prevent me from labeling it as totally worthless. <br />This book certainly feels very earnest.  It's attempting to hit quite a lot of buttons here, but many of them are missed.  LEGACY may have its heart in the right place, but its brain is slightly off-center.  A lot of the problems are relatively minor, but the sheer number of them prevented me from liking this one.	2002-12-01
US	50631983	R3R3G28UOCJ7RG	0426204107	419861252	Tragedy Day (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	1	1	1	N	N	A Tragedy	I thought I was never going to be able to finish this book.  Virtually nothing about this appealed to me in any sort of way whatsoever.  For something that seemed like an attempt at a light, frothy and throwaway romp, I found it to be an extremely tiring, turgid and monotonous read.  The only thing that the book gets right about the Doctor is the picture on the cover (even that turns out to be a cheat), and neither Ace nor Benny manage to rise out of the depths of one-dimensionality that the rest of the characters are trapped in.  The humor is just flat and the parodies are entirely forgettable.<br />TRAGEDY DAY attempted to be a satire of a handful of different things.  Unfortunately, it seemed to be blurring the line between being a satire of something awful and just plain being awful.  For example, at the very beginning the TARDIS crew is split off into different subplots.  This is, of course, almost a standard feature in Doctor Who stories.  But Roberts doesn't even bother giving them any real motivation for splitting up.  Ace just suddenly decides that she wants to walk away from the Doctor and Benny for absolutely no reason.  I genuinely couldn't tell if Roberts was attempting to poke fun at this convention in storytelling, or just honestly and unknowingly fell into it -- being unable or unwilling to come up with a realistic set of motivations.  I actually spent several minutes trying to guess whether this was deliberate or accidental, and I just couldn't figure it out.  I eventually decided that whatever it was, it wasn't a success at whatever it was trying to convey.  If it was a joke, it fell flat; if it was a real plot point, then it was just unbelievably poorly executed.<br />And this sort of thing is representative of quite a lot of my reaction to the book.  The plot is stunningly silly, and I was rolling my eyes at it rather than giggling along with it.  The way the villain is defeated is shockingly uninspired, and although I won't spoil it, I will saythat when you're forced to borrow plot points from TIMELASH, it's time to abandon that line of thought and try again after a good night's rest.  (To be fair to the author, knowing a little about how NA deadlines could sometimes be bumped up to accommodate changes in the schedule, it's entirely possible that there simply wasn't a \\"next morning\\" in which to think up something better.  But even so, the result here is tremendously poor.)<br />There were one or two bright spots mixed in.  The satire is mostly blunt and ineffectual, but there were one or two moments were it suddenly discovered a razor sharp point.  And there was a hilarious character, Ernie the hired assassin, who just happens to be a giant spider, dressed like something out of a Western and speaking like Brian Blessed with a fake working-class accent.  Naturally, this wonderful and amusing character is given very little screen-time and is removed from the story far before the end.  Shame.  This character could have at least made the book slightly more palatable, and I shed real tears when he exited the narrative.<br />Simply put, I couldn't wait to finish TRAGEDY DAY and move on to something else.  I just don't get this apparent style of \\"humor\\".  To me, comedy comes from more than simply repeating bad things that other stories have done.  Unfortunately, this book does nothing more than that.  When Ernie McCartney leaves the story, there's no more reason to read.	2002-12-01
US	50631983	R2NU94J847BQZI	0141182342	744273601	The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)	Books	4	41	43	N	N	Nightmare Fuel	This was my first exposure to the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, and I enjoyed it so much that half way through, I went out and bought another collection, THE THING ON THE DOORSTEP AND OTHER WEIRD STORIES.  Lovecraft's prose is creepy in a way that I really hadn't experienced from other so-called horror writers.  A lot of the stories follow the same basic structure, but that didn't distract from the fact that these were some of the wildest and most chilling stories that I have read in a very long time.<br />I had heard a lot about the types of stories that Lovecraft wrote, but I wasn't really prepared for how creepy they would be.  A lot of them really shouldn't be as shocking as they are, but somehow Lovecraft gets away with it.  He likes to use a lot of frivolous language and has the tendency to take short cuts by saying that the various creatures and entities are too frightening, too complicated, or too alien for the human mind to comprehend.  While I'm usually the first person to roll my eyes at this sort of literary cop-out, I was completely enthralled by its use here.  Lovecraft's command of language is precise and effective.  The monsters and Gods that he describes truly seem fearsome and unnerving.<br />The actual plots of these stories seem to be vaguely repetitive.  Since this is the first collection of Lovecraft that I have read, I'm not sure if these is indicative of his work in general, but it is certainly apparent that many of these stories follow the same basic structure.  I didn't really find this to be a problem though.  There are enough major differences in the stories that they don't all seem to blend together, despite their commonalities.  This was helped, no doubt, by the fact that I only read a few stories at a time, managing to absorb the book slowly over a longer period of time.  <br />This edition is semi-annotated, though I'd advice against reading them if you've never encountered these stories before.  They contain a lot of background detail, but also contain numerous spoilers.    I found myself reading a story and then going back and safely reading the notes and references.  Each story is also given a short write-up that gives a non-fictional account of the background.  Interested readers can see what the circumstances were behind each of the writings, as well as their publishing history.<br />To be honest, it's difficult to review a short story collection.  After all, there are eighteen different tales in this book, and the reviewer simply doesn't have enough space to discuss each one individually.  The best that I can do is to state that while there were one or two stories that failed to grab, the vast majority of these were spellbinding and genuinely unsettling.	2002-11-25
US	50631983	R2GHBKJZRGARFW	0451161351	381306153	Cujo	Books	3	9	12	N	N	Mad Dogs And Americans	I found CUJO to be a bit of a strange read.  While I was expecting the horror story of the mad dog to be front and center, it actually takes quite a while before that becomes the focus.  By the end, it's a pity that the standard horror story takes over, because I found myself much more interested in the characters that had been created here.  It's on odd mixture of horror and human character studies that works well in some places, but jars oddly in others.<br />The Cujo of the title is the name of a dog gone bad - or going bad, as it takes a least a hundred and fifty pages before Cujo develops into a truly frightening creature.  During the course of this opening, the dog becomes afflicted with rabies, a tangible and real threat.  And while there are touches of the supernatural sprinkled through the story, the primary fear comes from our physical world.  A huge, power and ferocious dog with a known disease is a very frightening concept.  From a very early age, children are taught to fear and to run from any animal displaying the symptoms of that illness, and Stephen King is quite good at tapping into this specific fear.<br />On the other hand, while the Cujo sequences are indeed effective, they are not really anything special.  But I was quite interested in the two families that were developed here.  The human dimension really overshadowed most of what was going on with the dog's subplot, but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  Stephen King creates two families and carefully gives them several similarities, but gives them enough distinctions for us to see how each family member ticks.  It's quite interesting to see the different ways that the two families react to troubles in marriage, raising children, and their attitudes to the rich vs. the poor.  It does occasionally come across as heavy-handed, but there are enough subtleties involved to make the whole thing worth reading.  I was really surprised to find this sensitive and enjoyable characterization given thatI was expecting nothing more than a dog eating his way through small town America.<br />In the end though, the book does fall back on its stock horror component, which just seems to lack a certain oomph.  A lot of the interesting characterization falls by the wayside as the conclusion approaches.  The ending is heavily involved in concluding the rabid dog subplot, and most of the details surrounding the people, the marriages and the families are left unmentioned and unresolved.  It's a pity that King took that sort of ending, because I felt that there was still some gold to be mined there.<br />I can't help but wonder if this book would have worked better if split up into two separate novels - one a horror story and the other the human drama.  Alternatively, the two disparate pieces could have been integrated together with more coherence.  But as it stands, the two sections, while having several highlights, don't seem to match up well with each other.  CUJO is less than the sum of its parts, which is a shame given how enjoyable and engrossing several of the main parts are.	2002-11-18
US	50631983	R2797ZS9NEKJA1	0426204093	867594658	No Future (Doctor Who-The New Adventures)	Books	2	0	1	N	N	No Present	Oh dear.  I really didn't like NO FUTURE at all.  I didn't find it to be offensively poor, but it tried to do too many different things, and I couldn't make myself care about any of them.  A scant few days after reading it, and I simply can't think of much of anything that stuck out in my mind.  Everything was so underdeveloped that it just went in my brain and then just went right back out of it.  Well, it will make for a short review anyway.<br />There's so much going on here that it's difficult for me to recall enough about any one particular item to discuss.  The book begins with a punk band filled with anarchists, but they (save Danny, who becomes a bit faceless) and the rebellious spirit all but disappear part of the way through.  There some interesting stuff done with the UNIT characters, but then they're replaced in favor of the Broadsword division.  The Broadsword division is set up in an interesting way, but there simply isn't enough time left to give them the development that they need.  NO FUTURE feels like a rough draft, or a brainstorming session.  <br />Interestingly enough, the one thing that the book does spend a lot of time on, Ace's &quot;murderous plans&quot; that the back cover mentions, is actually done extremely well.  If there's a single reason to read this book, then it's to see the resolution of several character storylines that had been running through the NAs for quite some time.  It's a shame about the rest of the book really.  It almost seems as though the entirety of the non-character sequences were written purely to place the Doctor, Ace and Benny into the situations that Cornell wanted them in.  When they actually get to those places, the book is great.  But the actual plodding around to get to them was too boring and too scattershot to be really enjoyable.  It's like taking a long car ride to a wonderful beach in a cramped and smelly automobile, only to arrive half an hour before sunset.  The reward at the end of the journey is quite good in itself, just not enough to make up for the problems encountered en route.<br />It's a pity that so much of the book simply doesn't work.  Individually there are a lot of elements that were done better in other Cornell books.  The perceived betrayal, the revamp of the Brigadier/UNIT, the interaction between the characters, and the desire to break the rules of society are almost all familiar elements.  We know that Cornell can do them better because he either had done them better or would go on to do them better.  They just weren't given enough of a chance, so consequently they all seem underdeveloped.  Reading other books in the Cornell back-catalog would be a great way to see what he's capable of doing on these same topics.  You just won't find that same greatness here.<br />(Oh, and the cover is hideous.  For some reason, everyone except the person I assume to be Benny has weird teddy bear fur sticking out of the top of their heads.  I assume that person is Benny purely based on the fact that she's obviously using the force to levitate a can of beer out of the audience.  And who can blame her?  If I suddenly morphed into Liza Minelli, I think I'd be driven to drink as well.)	2002-11-01
US	50631983	R3VF5EWPJ2UIFA	0426204085	757506618	Conundrum (Doctor Who the New Adventures)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Con-fun-drum	While reading CONUNDRUM, I honestly couldn't tell who had the most fun -- the reader or the writer.  Most of the jokes that Steve Lyons comes up with are of the type that instantly provides us with an image of the author racing through pulp and dime novels gleefully looking for conventions to subvert.  One imagines that he also rewatched and reread several earlier Doctor Who adventures, as there are one or two knowing winks to standard formulas.<br />What starts off as a relatively typical murder/mystery/vampire story (they're more common than you think), thankfully, becomes a much more bizarre tale.  \\"Thankfully\\", because a) the original story isn't all the great to begin with and b) the tale that follows makes the beginning portions of the book much more interesting and (more importantly) funny in retrospect.  The humor is very clever and is never anything less than charming.  It makes the entire story engaging and engrossing.  In many places the plot is secondary to the fun, but since it is undoubtedly effective, there's no problem with that.<br />There's something about Steve Lyon's prose that I find really appealing.  It's not especially poetic, but there is a certain flair to the writing.  It has the quality that makes it appear to have been effortless to write; whether this is true, I don't have any way of knowing, but it's certainly effortless to read.  The characters are all deliberately a bit vague and stereotypical, but this is obviously done on purpose and Lyons plays a lot with the audience expectations.<br />One of the more enjoyable NAs in the series, CONUNDRUM has held up very well since its publication.  A handful of later books would attempt a similar breaking down of the fourth wall, but none of them would be as entertaining.  A great book, and one that kept me guessing all the way through.	2002-10-31

But there's nothing wrong with it that could be blamed on this particular production of the play.  The actors are good considering the flimsy material that they have to work with.  The music is used sparingly, but is very effective at setting the scene.  I just couldn't get over the shallow development of the characters and a script that was constantly attempting to be deeper than it was.<br />The story has one location.  Two brothers sit in their mother's house, yelling and screaming at each other until the parental unit herself appears near the end of the play.  I like the idea behind the story, which is to put two people in a confined area and see what happens to them.  Unfortunately, most of what we learn about these two is quite dull.  One brother is a moderately successful screenwriter while the other makes his living as a petty burglar.  I had hoped that we wouldn't get soppy scenes of each brother revealing that he secretly envied the other's lifestyle, but that's exactly what we get here.  The successful brother is the one without good people skills and the streetwise brother really wants to make it big, but doesn't have the proper school learning to do so.  You've probably seen this sort of thing played out in films, television and theatre thousands of times before; I know I have.  The problem here is that there is virtually nothing else going on in the script to distract from the banality of the characters.<br />The humor comes across as being forced -- very forced -- especially in the second half.  The play is billed as a tragicomedy, but the transition from the funny scenes to the dramatic is shockingly jarring.  You can almost hear the goofy, &quot;Hey, this is funny!&quot; music in the background every time a supposedly lighthearted moment comes up.  It's possibly attempting to be a black comedy, but I just can't really see it that way.  People who moan and whine and complain constantly could very well be hilarious, but I just wasn't amused by them.  The comedy didn't flow naturally from the drama, and the drama just hung limply by itself out in No Man's Land.<br />If you already know that you like the play, then you will probably enjoy this particular staging of it.  The various sound effects and music are used in moderation, and are very efficient at placing the audience right inside that house.  The script does have one or two nice lines about the falseness of the Hollywood lifestyle and the boundary between the life that we see in pop culture compared to the reality that we drive through every day.  They aren't the most original observations that you'll ever hear, but the wording of them and the acting of the principals really make those short sequences work.  It's a pity that the rest of the script wasn't as sharp as these moments, because they really had me longing to hear more.<br />At one point near the end, the hardened brother (who is attempting to write a screenplay, just like his sibling) asks, &quot;What do you call it when something's been said a thousand times before?&quot; The answer that he receives is, of course, &quot;a cliché&quot;.  And unfortunately that sums up almost this entire production.  Other dramas that have utilized these rather basic elements haven't made the mistake of not including anything else.  But TRUE WEST is just one big cliché.	2002-10-30
US	50631983	R4OF8CBUWRTAG	0684825295	141705439	City Life	Books	3	23	24	N	N	Informative	The back cover contains a quote from Wall Street Journal reviewer Roger Starr, stating that CITY LIFE by Witold Rybczynski is a \\"fascinating investigation of what cities - especially modern cities - should be like.\\" This isn't strictly true. It's an investigation all right, but one more focused on what modern cities actually are and how they came to be that way, than a manifesto about the way things ought to be. A lot of history is covered, from brief mentions of the earlier dwellings of the Native Americans to the complexities inherent in our modern metropolises.<br />The book focuses mostly upon the development of cities in the United States and Canada. European cities are occasionally mentioned and discussed, but only in how they compare to their North American cousins. It's a history of cities, which combines modern-day thoughts on their development as well as some historical comments from what the people of the time thought of how their cities were emerging. Rybczynski also manages to touch on the roles of commercialism, art, and the unique qualities of North America that have helped to define our cities. Cities did not spring fully-formed, nor were they all laid out at the same time, and the author takes time to explore how different approaches to city planning created vastly differing results. He compares the many different approaches, from the organized and structured to the evolving and improvised.<br />The absolute biggest flaw with this text is that it is indeed just a text. Outside of the cover (featuring a sketching of a 19th Century street-scene and a poignant pre-9/11 photograph of the New York City skyline), there are no illustrations. No pictures, no diagrams, no maps, no charts, no blueprints, no photos -- nothing. Like Alice, I couldn't understand why someone would write a book such as this without including pictures. Rybczynski, therefore, spends far too much time describing city layouts, maps, street diagrams and other visual artifacts, leavingthe reader without a pictorial aid. Photographs and maps are described rather than included. It's very frustrating. A picture is worth a thousand words, and in a book that is this heavily involved concerned with what things look like, some pictures would have been invaluable. <br />Rybczynski's writing style is relatively engaging, though he does have an unfortunate tendency to lapse into dry lists of various items (usually one word mentions of various architects and city planners). This can be infrequently distracting, leading one to wonder if perhaps some of the information could have been conveyed in a more interesting way. Still, the history of cities as well as the philosophy behind their growth makes for fascinating subjects, so whatever faults may lie in the book, it is still well worth reading.	2002-10-25
US	50631983	R318B5XFLFID0E	0517446499	43326839	The Day Lincoln Was Shot	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Pulp Fact	THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT should be required reading for anyone with an interest in American History.  The sheer amount of detail here is invaluable.  Historian Jim Bishop has gone to the original newspaper accounts, court documents and government records to get at the indisputable facts.  Contradictory reports have been reconciled, confusing motivations and events have been plainly explained, and the result is a book brimming with information but which is still easy enough for us laymen to read.<br />The format of the material will be familiar to any fan of the television show \\"24\\".  Like that piece of modern drama, the book is laid out so that each chapter is devoted to a single hour.  The result is a slow, detailed progression through the day that pushes up the tension as the fatal hour approaches.  The book begins at 7 a.m. on the morning of April 14th, 1865, continues through the actual assassination during the 10 o'clock hour and then concludes with the death of Lincoln at 7:22 a.m. the following morning.  Of course, the similarities between this account and the much-hyped television series are purely structural - the story isn't fictitious, and we already know the ending.<br />Two chapters interrupt this narrative.  One that gives a background into the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, and another that gives us a brief history of the conspiracy.  This book doesn't try to give more than a short summary on those two topics, so readers interested in those subjects should also find other material.  This book is primarily concerned with getting across the actual events of the day rather than trying to put every single fact into a historical perspective.  It reads like an extremely detailed journal told from an omniscient observer.<br />One thing I didn't like was Bishop's tendency to write the factual events in an overly dramatic style.  We're treated to people's inner thoughts, their facial expressions, occasional over-dramatic language, and other items that couldn'tpossibly be known to the author.  To be fair, Bishop does acknowledge in the introduction that he does take certain liberties of that type in the name, presumably, of dramatic license.  The only problem I had with this approach is that the fourteenth of April 1895 is already one of the most gripping and shocking days in American history.  There really wasn't any need to make the action more exciting.  More often than not, these little pieces of intrusion annoyed me, though this wasn't nearly enough to distract from the hard facts of the event.<br />Prior to reading THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT, my knowledge of the mechanics behind the assassination was sadly deficient.  This book has provided me with a lot of information behind the events of that day as well as firing up my interest in U.S. Civil War history.  I hope that future books that I read on this subject are as organized and as lucid as this one.	2002-10-20
US	50631983	RHRUTVQGPADL7	0426204042	452447912	The Left-Handed Hummingbird (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The One With The Funny Title And The Silly Cover	THE LEFT-HANDED HUMMINGBIRD is one of the few Doctor Who books that I've read multiple times.  It's one of my favorites and never disappoints.  It feels different from a lot of the books surround it in the series, and given the differing styles of the NA authors, that is saying quite a bit.  <br />\\"Gritty\\", \\"realistic\\" and \\"intense\\" are the words that come to mind first when thinking about this book.  The characters are certainly put through hell, but it never feels gratuitous or unnecessary.  Their suffering isn't approached one-dimensionally, as the ordeals that our friends are put through actually reveal a lot about how their characters work.  It's a bit of a cliché to say so, but we learn about fictional characters when we see them put through the wringer.  It's not so much that we see people here who are scared, but that their fear is portrayed in a realistic way.  There is no false bravado or boring heroism.  When people stand up against the odds, it actually means something.<br />The story is relatively fast-moving.  I was amazed at how much had happened before I had even got to page fifty.  The plot is perhaps a little more complicated than it really needs to be, but I found that to be enjoyable, so I can't complain too much.  It all fits together logically and satisfactorily.  No cheap short cuts are taken, so despite the different timelines and detailed plot strands, everything fits together amazingly well.<br />There's not too much to complain about here.  A few of the Beatles jokes get a little silly.  Maybe the plot jumps about a bit too quickly at the end.  Though when these are the biggest problems in a book you know you're reading a winner.  If you never got around to reading this one on its initial publication, then you missed out on something special.  This one's a keeper.	2002-10-14
US	50631983	R227XUREHX2KTM	0563538546	66308126	History 101 (Doctor Who)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A Recommended Course	HISTORY 101 is an intelligent and thoughtful novel that treats its central premise in a mature and satisfying manner.  The concepts are dealt with quite interestingly and my attention was held throughout the entire story.  Although I didn't quite connect with all of the characters, I was intrigued enough by the plot to read through at a very quick rate.    The mechanics of the story are all handled quite well, and the book was almost perfectly paced.<br />As the back cover informs us, HISTORY 101 is about (you guessed it) history and how it is perceived.  And this feature of the book is one of its greatest assets.  Mags L. Halliday takes this relatively unambiguous notion and draws it out to some very interesting conclusions.  Upon reflection, it seems strange now that a science-fiction series like Doctor Who hasn't actually dealt with this idea before; it just seems like an obvious thing to do.  Rather than being just a gimmick, the perception aspect is dealt with in a very appealing way.  It affects the plot, the characters, and the whole tone of the novel.  It adds a fascinating flavor to a story that was already intelligent enough on its own.<br />The only downside in this book is that there are a handful of places where the central concept is developed a bit too clinically for my taste.  The characters are noteworthy, but there are times where I had trouble connecting with them emotionally.  They obviously interact with the perception of history quite a bit, but they didn't appear to be as three-dimensional as I was expecting.  There are a few notable exceptions, such as Fitz who has quite an interesting subplot of his own.  He comes across realistically and forcibly, which is quite notable given how much into the background he has started to fade in the series.  Unfortunately, not all of these strengths are continued on into other characters and situations, but that is still a minor defect overall.<br />HISTORY 101 comes as a recommended course for anyone interested in either the overall story of the current EDAs, or just for someone looking for a pretty darn good standalone story.  It's a thoughtful story but with enough thrills and spills to keep one's interest going for the entirety.  What struck me most about the book was the feeling at how carefully structured it felt.  While this might have caused the story to feel a tiny bit forced at times (rather than flowing naturally), it makes for a very well crafted tale.  I look forward to reading more novels from this newcomer to the range.	2002-10-10

There's nothing inherently wrong with it, and, in fact, there is quite a lot here that is very enjoyable.  However, there's also nothing really fantastic about it either.  I read the story, and I enjoyed it, but there was very little that stood out about it in my mind after I had finished.  It works well as a simple adventure, but don't go into it expecting anything more.<br />The plot appears to be a tad more ambitious than it actually is.  It's set in two main time zones with a lot of interacting going on between them, and that layer of complexity really doesn't have all that much impact on the plot.  There didn't seem to be any real plot reason for having the action spread out over time rather than space, but it did make the story seem just a little bit more interesting.  It's a case of style over substance, perhaps, but it works.  The plot may not be especially complicated, but it is fairly clever in a few places.  There are parts that are a predictable, yet I found one or two twists that genuinely surprised me.  The modern-day Oxford setting is drawn realistically and goes a long way in helping add to the atmosphere.  This contrasts well with the ghost story feeling of the passages set in the future.<br />The characters introduced here are competently drawn, but aren't particularly deep.  They fulfill the functions that the plot requires of them, and aren't really fleshed out beyond that.  Again, the characterization isn't anything that really hurts the book, and, indeed, there are a handful of moments that do stand out as being special.  It's just that the vast majority of what we see is adequate, but not great.<br />Actually, my overall opinion of THE DIMENSION RIDERS was adequate, but not great.  There is indeed a small smattering of interesting pieces, and the storyline itself it quite fun, even if it isn't terribly deep.  The hints dropped here concerning the ongoing Alternative History story-arc are intriguing.  You could probably skip this one and not worry about missing anything terribly exciting, but you'd be missing out on an enjoyable few hours.	2002-10-07

The book didn't blow my mind, or stand my world-view on its head, but it did keep me entertained and amused.  It's not deep, it's not heavy, but it's quite a bit of fun.<br />The plot moves quickly and provides us with very few dull moments.  For much of the time I genuinely didn't know what direction the story was going to move in.  That is especially praiseworthy when one considers how uninspired the bare outline of the story might have read, featuring, as it does, a treasure hunt, an ancient relic and a political power-struggle.  So the fact that Justin Richards managed to make these somewhat tired elements not only interesting, but also quite unpredictable, is striking.  The storyline manages to twist in logical and interesting ways, reviving any reader who may have grown weary of too many adventure stories based on long lost riches and power-mad dictators.<br />There was one section that kept annoying me though, and I was fortunate that the offending passages weren't thrown into the forefront too many times.  Richards sets up the power-struggle in such a way that the focus of a tyrant's ambition is ultimately not really necessary, given what his main objectives are.  A few times it is mentioned that some of his motivations are really just for show, as he already has a great deal of political power and influence.  It kept nagging at me, because it felt as though this was getting in the way of the story being told.  I thought it was shooting itself in the foot by cheapening and lessening the main thrust of the plot.  On the other hand, this really wasn't referenced to all that often, and the resolution to this particular strand went a good way towards regaining my favor.<br />In this, her second book since branching out on her own, Benny is shown to be quite capable of carrying a series by herself.  She's still a very engaging character, but more importantly, the fictional universe itself contains more than enough outlying pieces for the star to interact with.  This series is getting richer as it goes along, and there are lots of little pieces for the authors to draw on if needed, or to ignore if unnecessary.  It's certainly boding well for the later books in the series, and I'm quite looking forward to getting to the rest of them.<br />DRAGONS' WRATH was definitely a solid and enjoyable adventure.  If you really wanted to skip it, you probably wouldn't miss anything terribly important.  But it's a fairly diverting and compelling story, so I really couldn't recommend doing that.  Read this one on a lazy Sunday afternoon.	2002-10-04
US	50631983	RZ3X744ZMCD9W	0563555920	163482563	Verdigris (Doctor Who (BBC))	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Almost, but just not quite worth it	The good news about VERDIGRIS is that it has the honor of being one of the only Doctor Who books that I found time to finish reading in one sitting.  The bad news is that the only reason I managed to complete the story so quickly was because I was on an airplane and had run out of other things to read.  Not that it was a horrible book -- I found it to be a bit mixed, all things considered.  The Doctor that Paul Magrs writes for is perfectly Pertwee, in every way.  The UNIT regulars appear briefly, but are again deadly accurate to how they appeared on television.  Jo Grant's portrayal is relatively shallow, but considering the basis that Magrs had to work with, that probably means he was again completely in keeping with what came before.  I had enjoyed every other of Paul Magrs' Doctor Who books (SCARLET EMPRESS was a personal favorite, but MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMEN and THE BLUE ANGEL both have much to recommend), but this was his book that I appreciated the least.<br />VERDIGRIS is a book that lives or dies based on how well the satire works for the individual reader.  The plot is paper-thin, and many of the secondary characters can be described similarly, being rather shallow and stereotypical.  The storyline is unpredictable purely because it flies along in a confidently irrational manner. The main villain is not something to be terribly frightened of, and the Doctor's allies are almost entirely incomprehensible.  Of course, these features are all part of the point of the big satirical joke running through the narrative (the joke being that Doctor Who was often camp, silly, and cheap).  Doctor Who has always had some aspects to it that simply weren't up to par, and many of them have been poked fun at by fans for decades.  But having many of them in a single book meant that I found myself being forced to encounter loads of things that I hadn't particularly enjoyed in the first place and I was now having to read about them again.  This did little to endear the book tome.<br />Doctor Who has always been a series with the ability to poke fun at itself.  But humor is a very strange thing; what is funny to one person isn't necessarily funny to another.  Even a single joke can float or sink depending on that individual's mood.  What I've described above about the book doesn't really sound necessarily awful.  The problem for me with VERDIGRIS was not that the idea of a paper-thin plot revolving around fun jokes is necessarily a bad one, nor was it that Doctor Who should always take itself seriously.  What I didn't really like was that the execution here left a lot to be desired in numerous places (i.e., many of the jokes fell flat).  Had there been something else to entertain me, I probably would have had a more positive opinion of the whole.  Unfortunately, with virtually the whole of the book (plot, characters, motivations, etc) tied up in the central joke, there simply wasn't anything else left to interest me.  I finished the book feeling faintly underwhelmed.<br />I did laugh out loud a few times while reading VERDIGRIS; when Magrs' humor is firing straight, he strikes with a resounding bulls-eye.  The biggest problem for me was simply that the individual jokes started wearing a bit thin by the end.  Sure, there is a lot to take the mickey out of in the Pertwee era, and the jokes that worked for me were hilarious.  But unfortunately not all of it was as amusing as the author probably intended.  I was entertained by some jokes, but they just weren't enough to justify the rest.  The concept of, say, the villain being silly just because there were other silly villains in Doctor Who may be vaguely amusing, but actually having to read pages and pages of the dull villain didn't add up to a pleasant experience.  If the book had been significantly shorter, I think the humor would have held up better.  Not only would the plot have not felt nearly so vapid, but the comedy wouldn't have had the chance to grow cold.  There's a lot to recommend about VERDIGRIS, but unfortunately, there's just a little bit more that I found to counter those positive attributes.  Approach with caution.	2002-09-30
US	50631983	RWGI43HH7GXED	0061054097	198625382	Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection (The Final Sci Fi Coll.)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Worth Its Weight	\\"The Final Science Fiction Collection [from Isaac Asimov]\\" is what the cover to GOLD proclaims, and to be honest, I find that to be a rather sobering realization.  The Good Doctor was such a prolific author that even now, ten years after his death, the thought of that constant supply of words being silent is not a particularly happy one.  So we are left with this collection, from the later stages of Asimov's career, which puts together a lot of pieces that hadn't been anthologized and were fairly difficult to find.  The book is divided into three sections; the first, fifteen science fiction short stories; the second, eighteen essays about science fiction; the third, twenty selections about the art of writing science fiction.  It's a bit of a haphazard collection with essays and material coming from a variety of seemingly random sources, but for someone looking for those hard-to-find writings this should prove invaluable.<br />The collection of science fiction stories is certainly passable.  There's nothing particularly breathtaking or outstanding here, but the consistent level of quality is fairly high.  There was really only one story that I seriously disliked, and the rest were at least average or better.  A number of the stories would appear to be slightly autobiographical in nature, and it's interesting to see Asimov in a more reflective mood than usual.<br />The essays that deal with the topic of science fiction itself have been pulled from multiple sources.  Some of them are editorials from his magazine, while others have been copied from introductions to SF collections.  It's this section that gives one the slight feeling that this is merely a cashing in on the popularity of a famous author.  Certainly it's odd to see Asimov discussing the particulars of the individual stories and themes that are present in the book he was writing for, but for obvious reasons aren't actually included in this text.  Still, despite the strange nature of how they came to be included here, his thoughts and ideas on the subject are quite welcome.  Whether Asimov is reminiscing about the \\"Golden Age\\" of printed science fiction or talking about the exact role of robots or aliens in the genre, his arguments are presented clearly and the healthy dash of wit familiar to his many fans.<br />The final third of the collection is a subject that Asimov knew well and loved speaking and writing about.  He has a lot of tips for young and hopeful science fiction authors, as well as insights into his own creative process.  Asimov's approach to describing science fiction is to talk a lot about his own science fiction stories.  Not just that he liked talking about his own work (which, of course, he did), but by analyzing criticism and praise of his own writings he demonstrates his own particular way of developing stories.  I found this section to be fairly interesting although he had covered this topic in other areas (in particular, his autobiography and in various introductions).<br />My only wish was that we readers had been given some information on the selection and editing process.  Presumably only a fraction of the editorials and introductions that Asimov ever wrote were included here, but we aren't actually told what the criteria were.  Possibly the editor(s) wanted only essays on a certain subject, but as the umbrella seems to have been fairly wide on this collection, it's difficult to ascertain what they were looking for.  It's a minor complaint of mine, to be sure, but it would have gone a long way towards explaining the somewhat haphazard manner that the collection seems to take.<br />I recommend skipping through GOLD, mixing the reading order so that one experiences Asimov's thoughts in a random progression rather than attempting to view it as an arranged analysis (though eventually reading every work in the collection, of course).  Asimov was an author who had a lot to say (a LOT to say -- over 400 books worth) and here is what will probably serve as his final written words on and about science fiction.  It's a fitting tribute.	2002-09-30

And, at the time, it was more than enough to pull me enthusiastically into the series.  I was fascinated by the new companion, Benny.  I was quite interested in the story-arc that began in this book.  Seeing the old television stories in a new light and from a different perspective really warmed my inner fan-boy heart.  Before I reread the story, now many years later, I couldn't wait to see how well it had aged.  Although I had never read it since my initial perusal, it had always remained one of my favorite NAs.<br />To say that rereading this book came as a disappointment would be an enormous understatement.  Perhaps it's because the NAs (and later, the EDAs) would reach much greater heights.  Maybe I was a less sophisticated reader back in those days.  But whatever the reason, I couldn't help but notice that many of the sequences really didn't seem to be much beyond the level of the Target novelisations.  There are far too many action-oriented sequences that simply weren't interesting enough to sustain my attention.  A lot of the characters varied between being stereotypical and just plain dull.  The plot meandered into numerous vague areas; the storyline just feeling boring and uninspired.  \\"Dreary characters wandering off on mind-numbing wild goose chases\\" is a summary of far too much of this story.<br />The book is structured around several moral dilemmas.  When is war inevitable?  What price is too high to pay for victory?  To fight monsters, is it necessary to become one?  Each of these questions (and the many others that the book raises) are interesting and intriguing concepts.  Yet Mortimore never brings these questions out of the realm of one-dimensionality.  Instead of complicated character motivations, we're treated to stock, clichéd ciphers.  We have the warmongers, the peacemakers, and the pawns, but not one of them has apparently given more than thirty seconds of thoughtto their situation.  Some very interesting questions are raised, but the answers that we're given are beyond shallow.  Far too many of these apparently high-concept arguments just come across as overblown, superficial, and pretentious.<br />A few sequences and conversations that occur are fairly enjoyable.  Unfortunately, they're rather spread out.  It was a nice idea to see the how some familiar characters dealt with extraordinary circumstances, but the execution was sorely lacking in many areas.  A few of these gems did manage to shine through; indeed, there's a powerful scene near the end where one of the characters takes his limited portrayal to the logical conclusion, creating an involving and emotional passage.  But, unfortunately, this is the exception rather than the rule.  For every one thing that I was interested in, there would be half a dozen things that had me rolling my eyes.  Great massive chunks of this book could have been cut right out without losing anything.  There would have been much to be gained from magnifying the things that this book did manage to succeed at, rather than having them buried under mounds of uninteresting and unbelievable moralizing.  Giving the characters some realistic motivations wouldn't have hurt either.<br />If I hadn't reread this one, I would still have the much higher opinion of it that I formed back when I read it for the first time.  Still it's interesting to read this in light of where the Doctor Who books were to go in the future.  The topics and ideas discussed here about war and fighting monsters would be revisited again and again (a few times by Jim Mortimore himself).  BLOOD HEAT shows these arguments in their immature infancy and at least we can see how much better they got.	2002-09-30
US	50631983	R143KVS4DK9E12	0563538562	667660902	The Crooked World (Doctor Who)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	The Six Degrees of Streaky Bacon	I can't believe that I'm going to be so positive about a book with a childishly cartoon cover and one that is set not a million miles away from Porky Pig's dwelling, but here goes -- THE CROOKED WORLD is the best EDA of the year so far. I'm not entirely sure how Steve Lyons managed to pull off such a feat, but this is certainly an impressive piece of writing. The jokes come, not at the expense of the material, but with a love of the source, and the intelligent look at what is being parodied is done in a subtle touching way that I hadn't guessed was possible. <br />For many of us, the cartoons recreated and joked about in this book are pieces of fiction that we've been watching for as long as we can remember (even longer than Doctor Who in some cases!) and the familiarity with this material gives Lyons quite an advantage here. With only a few carefully constructed sentences, he can tap into literally hours worth of memories of Acme Co. anvils, mice cleverly outwitting cats and other staples of the Loony Toons and Merry Melodies universes. All the work has been done in the past, and Lyons can easily invoke the material that has already been created. <br />But what makes THE CROOKED WORLD so special is not merely that he's putting the Doctor Who characters into a cartoon universe (as GRIMM REALITY merely placed the regulars in the world of fairy tales), it's that he is able to bring the cartoon world closer to the real one, subverting the conventions of that genre. He holds it up to the light, not just to point out that the physics in Bug Bunny sketches is faulty, but to demonstrate the real fundamental differences. The cartoon people (made up of assorted pigs, dogs, cats, and others) are embarking upon a very clearly defined journey from two-dimensional silliness to something greater. Like observing children as they turn into adults, we can anticipate many of the trials and tribulations they will encounter, but we keep watching to see how they'll deal with these realworld concepts. A lot of the success of this book comes down to the subtle cleverness of Lyons' writing skills. Indeed, there are death scenes that are as affecting as any ever seen in Doctor Who, and the characters are among the most interesting ever seen in the series. Maybe it's more emotionally powerful because we've known characters like this all of our lives, but whatever the reason, it is very involving. <br />I have no idea what someone would make of this if they weren't at least a little familiar with the cartoons being lovingly mocked here. Fortunately, Lyons manages to subvert a lot of the conventions of this genre, so I'd imagine that even someone who's had a cave for an address for the past fifty years would find something enjoyable here. Certainly I found much here that was unbelievably entertaining and unexpectedly touching. Rarely has death and pain been touched on so expertly in the Doctor Who books and the fact that the people dying and suffering are evolving cartoon characters just goes to demonstrate how powerful the writing is. Definitely an EDA not to be missed. (And the Scooby Doo jokes are hilarious.)	2002-09-26

The book is certainly written by Groucho, contains his inimitable style and sense of humor, and does tell a few stories about his life.  But anyone looking for any sort of detail surrounding Groucho's life would be well advised to try someplace else.<br />But instead of criticizing the book for what it isn't, I'd rather spend this review talking about what it does well.  Groucho is an engaging and hilarious writer.  He admits right at the very beginning that most of the stories and anecdotes may not be entirely accurate.  To publish a truthful and precise account is something that he says he would not be comfortable doing unless he was dead.  Since a live Groucho writes infinitely better than a dead Groucho, we are left with this &quot;pure ersatz Groucho&quot;, as he calls it.  And to be honest, the lack of detail doesn't particularly hurt the book.  Without having to deal with all the messiness that reality brings, Groucho is able to jump into all sorts of hilarious stories and asides.  Marx is much more interested in telling a funny story than he is about historical accuracy, and I certainly can't complain, given how amused I was by his hilarious lunacy.  <br />Groucho tells a lot of stories and he tells them well.  Telling a linear autobiography is not one of his priorities, as he bounces between decades with as much enthusiasm as Harpo chasing after a particularly beautiful blonde.  His stories range from the time that he wrote the book (1959) back to his childhood in New York.  The stories are occasionally tender, but most of the time they are just very funny.  Groucho tells an anecdote in such a way that not only is the punch line funny, but so are most of the lines leading up to it.  His family appears in many of his more memorable stories, not just his famous brothers, but also his young daughter, Melinda.  Much of his career is made mention of, from his later success at radio and television to his earlier triumphs in vaudeville.<br />If you're looking for a fun autobiography, then you could do much worse than reading GROUCHO AND ME.  Even if you go into the book expecting a frank and intimate life-story, you'll more than likely be won over by Groucho's hilarious writing style.  It's a fun and random journey through a life not totally dissimilar to Groucho's own, and one that more than makes up for in entertainment what it may lack in authenticity.	2002-09-25

So enthralled was I by the writing in these parts, that I rushed through and finished the book in much less time that it usually takes me to get through the 249-288 pages of the modern EDA. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the ending was up to the high standards of the rest of the novel, which is more frustrating in a book that is great up until the end rather than a book that is lousy all the way through. But despite the problems with the ending, I still quite enjoyed the entire experience. There's a lot of good writing on display, and the story was told with a lot of panache. <br />There are a lot of fairly high level science fiction concepts present in the book, and they are all handled with so much care and ease that I had to do a little bit of thinking before I fully realized what was going on. It has a quick feel to it, with many of the set-pieces serving well as standalone little mini-adventures. But don't get the impression that this is a throw-away or a shallow book. It's deceptively slick, but there's a lot of very interesting stuff going on beneath the surface. The prose is written with confidence and manages to convey a surprising amount using fairly little. The setting is described very well, and the scenes set there were so interesting that I wish we had stayed on the initial planet for longer. The \\"Unnoticed\\" aliens mentioned on the back cover are an interesting idea that, thankfully, are fleshed out quite well. I was a bit worried that they would come across as a generic threat, but Paul Ebbs managed to make them interesting enough to motivate the plot without coming across as mere ciphers. <br />It took me a quite a bit of thinking to get to grips with the ending. After much consideration, I concluded that while it did make logical sense and every character had a motivation for acting, it just wasn't quite satisfying. For a story that had been ambling on in an enjoyable, laid-back sort of way to suddenly switch gears so drastically was something that I found very distracting. It was quite a mental shift needed on my part to adjust. Even after I had worked everything through, I still felt vaguely unsatisfied. The final pages do adequately conclude the plot, but I don't feel that it properly gave us a conclusion to the story. It left me with a solid feeling of, \\"Is that it?\\" and not in a good way. <br />The style of The Book of the Still is very entertaining. Each page pulled me in deeper, leaving me eager to see what was coming next. The ending doesn't quite work on all levels, and it feels rushed, but the whole of the book shouldn't be ignored because of those weaknesses. It's quite a fun book to read despite some of the deeper issues that it deals with, and the characters are an entertaining bunch. Just be prepared to have to do a bit of thinking to understand the end.	2002-09-18
US	50631983	R20RSD1LSJE3W0	0394758285	849452523	The Big Sleep (A Philip Marlowe Novel)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Philip Marlowe rules OK	Perhaps the textbook from which all other modern thrillers are based, THE BIG SLEEP surprised me by being much more than just another tale of murder and deceit.  Certainly there's a lot of villainy on display, and a lot of the fundamentals of the genre can be found within these pages.  But it was Raymond Chandler's clever and distinct use of the language that kept me engrossed and interested.  <br />The book is heavy in description and dialogue while being fairly light on introspection.  But then, Philip Marlowe doesn't hang around thinking too much about his character, because that would cut into the time where he could be killin' an' drinkin' an' wise crackin'.  The characters aren't especially deep, but they're certainly worth reading about.  Chandler creates people who make up for in sheer griminess what they may lack in absolute realism.  They're intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable.<br />I found it much more fun to read about the people themselves rather than concentrating on the exact minutiae of their actions, and it seems that Chandler took the same approach to writing.  The plot is a little bit shaky at times and not everything quite adds up at the end of the book.  But as an effective mood piece, such details are mere trivialities.  The individual sequences are what make this a worthwhile piece of writing.  The characters, the slick prose and the swagger all combine to make this a memorable work.	2002-09-05
US	50631983	R1Y9BC3GRJPOEO	0743423984	67297470	Troublemakers: Stories by Harlan Ellison	Books	3	17	21	N	N	A Very Angry Man Makes Trouble	I find it somewhat difficult to sum up an entire book of short stories in a single review.  Many of the stories in TROUBLEMAKERS are magical, thought-provoking and wonderful.  But on the other hand, others in the collection simply bored me, and left me impatient for the next story to begin.  The book as a whole I found to be mostly hit and miss, with some real standouts that do manage to make the collection a welcome one.<br />Like a belligerent Rod Serling with a chip on his shoulder, Harlan Ellison angrily provides an introduction to each of his stories (sometimes being more entertaining in his factual summary than in the work of fiction itself) and describes some of the themes that he was attempting to inject into the particular story.  The overall hook of this collection is, as you may have guessed from the title, troublemakers and the, er, trouble that they make.  Included are stories ranging from 1956 up through the year of publication (2001), many of which are products of their era, yet still manage to have a timeless feel to them.  For example, the utterly sixties &quot;'Repent, Harlequin!' Said The Ticktockman&quot; is dripping with the feeling and sensibilities of that decade, but can be read today in the 21st century without losing any of its original passion.  The stories here make a good suite of tales, though you'll have to squint your eyes a bit to squeeze some of them under the troublemaking heading.  <br />As I mentioned, some of the stories here are absolutely amazing.  When Ellison's talents are clicking he can create stories that boggle the imagination and rank up with the best of Ray Bradbury, another master of the fantastical short story.  Yet there are several selections here that I found to be a bit dreary and inconsequential.  I wondered briefly if I had missed something, but after skimming what I had just read I came to the conclusion that I had, indeed, &quot;got&quot; the story, I just hadn't cared for it.  The worst of this collection tend to be uninteresting and contain foreseeable conclusions, sharply clashing with the imaginative heights of the best.  It's a pity that the collection is a bit haphazard because the really good stories definitely make this collection worth a purchase.<br />This was the first collection of Ellison's short stories that I've read and I certainly plan on reading more in the future.  Although I didn't care for several of the stories in this particular anthology, I recognized a quality that I liked.  TROUBLEMAKERS features stories that can be raw in places, have a sense of faint futility and aren't assured of a happy ending.  Many of them were genuinely unpredictable (and by unpredictable, I mean that I honestly didn't see the ending coming rather than guessing it but assuming that the author wouldn't go there) and occasionally unsettling.  The best stories in TROUBLEMAKERS did what any good anthology should do -- make me want to read more by this author.	2002-08-20
US	50631983	RMRXVOFBO71B	0140255125	472868610	The Woman Who Walked into Doors	Books	5	55	56	N	N	A remarkable achievement	Writing a story from the point of view of a battered woman is a bit like getting a head start in a race.  Before you've even begun you've virtually got the entire audience already on your side, united and standing by this poor abused female.  To do a mediocre job about a subject like this isn't terribly difficult purely based on the amount of emotional baggage that the reader is going to bring to the book.  But to produce a story in such a fantastic and astonishing way as is done here is breathtaking.  Roddy Doyle doesn't take the easy way out of anything.  The story is shockingly real and the characters are vividly brought to life.  The detail and the feelings are so intense that if one didn't know better, one would swear that this is genuinely the autobiographical story of a woman coming to the end of what she can take.  There were passages in here that I was physically uncomfortable reading, purely from the power of the writing and the intensity of the raw emotion.<br />The focus of Doyle's story is a fairly unremarkable housewife in contemporary Dublin who has the unexciting name of Paula Spencer.  On the surface, Paula's not a terribly interesting person.  She lives in an ordinary neighborhood, has a nostalgic regard for her childhood, and does the same normal things that thousands of other women her age do.  You probably know her, or someone quite like her.  As we learn more about Paula, as the layers get pulled back, we begin to see that there is more going on in her life than we initially suspected.  And, yet, nothing that we learn, by itself, is especially shocking given the world that we live in today.  Alcoholism, spousal abuse, and violence are unfortunately a part of life, so it's not the inclusion of those elements that lifts this book out of the ordinary.  Where the book succeeds is in painting a shockingly realistic portrayal of a relatively unassuming wife who has gotten herself trapped in a violent and abusive relationship.<br />We begin the book by seeing her the way she is seen by the people in her life who don't want to know what her real problems are.  But the author doesn't let us stay on the surface for long.  As we delve deeper and deeper into this woman's mind, the things we learn become more and more unsettling.  Nothing is brought out merely for shock value, and nothing is brought out just for show.  The reactions and attitudes of the woman are utterly and painfully real, while the actions themselves are explored in a deep and unsettling manner.  They way that Paula tries to cope with her situation is disturbingly realistic, allowing Doyle to really get to the heart of matters.  Paula's mindset is held up to the light for the audience to see the good, the bad, and the ugly.  The book is a powerful character study.<br />What keeps people in abusive and destructive relationships is something that is oftentimes a complete mystery to outsiders.  THE WOMAN WHO WALKED INTO DOORS tells this story from deep in the point of view of the victim.  The title of this book is, of course, a euphamism.  It's what Paula and thousands of women like her say to their friends to cover their black-eyes and bloodied, broken noses.  But it's telling in another way; Paula walks into the door, rather than through it, being unable escape the cycle of violence.  This book won't preach at you, but it may help you to understand exactly what is going through the head of a woman who keeps getting hit, but never seems to leave.  It's not a non-stop downer though, as Paula's narrative voice can be quite amusing at places.  However, it's her story that you'll remember long after reading this book, not the (admittedly funny) asides that she often makes.	2002-08-13
US	50631983	RD0V2UIVT9KWQ	0671039725	769595666	Carrie	Books	3	4	5	N	N	A bit unsteady, but enjoyable	I can't hold up CARRIE as an extremely deep or enlightening novel, but it was one that I had a lot of trouble putting down at the end of the day.  It takes a fairly simple premise and milks it for all that it's worth.  It's not particularly frightening or scary, just a simple, tense story told very, very well.<br />The characterization is really nothing to write home about here.  The people have their places and their actions to perform, but don't really exist in all three dimensions.  I didn't find this to be a problem though, as I wasn't expecting anything particularly outstanding in this department.  However, one character's shallowness did begin to annoy me after a while.  The eponymous Carrie has a mother, of course, and to describe this woman as a clichéd and one-dimensional stereotype would be to pay a compliment to the characterization.  I'm not particularly offended by the single portrayal of an over the top, religious, fanatical fundamentalist, but the sheer superficiality began to seriously annoy me.  Now, obviously, the book is set up in a way that the reader isn't supposed to empathize with this insane woman, yet I felt as if I was being hit over the head with this crude caricature.  Having a character that the audience can boo and hiss at is one thing, but to draw a person whose very presence in the story made me want to hurl the book the length of the room is another thing entirely.  If she had just been a little toned down, I doubt she would have been nearly so aggravating. <br />The story-line is quite simple and probably known to many more people than have actually read the book (or seen the film).  But this doesn't work against the book.  Indeed, the story constantly undermines climactic moments, by telling us the events far in advance of their appearance in the narrative.  Nearly every shocking event that occurs in the book has already been mentioned in the little asides that are scattered throughout.  This is a very effective way of heighteningthe tension.  Learning a lesson from Hitchcock, Stephen King knows that it's the suspense rather than the actual blood that keeps an audience hooked.  We know precisely what's coming, but it's the journey itself that is of supreme importance.  With every hint the book drops, the tension is racked up a notch.  By the time I reached the conclusion, that I had already anticipated, I was completely spellbound.<br />CARRIE is a simple story of childhood bullying, nonconformity and revenge, with a healthy sprinkling of horror thrown in.  The characters don't need to be terribly deep, because anyone who ever interacted with children know these people already and can fill in the gaps.  It feels slightly uneven and sloppy in places, but that certainly isn't enough to derail the whole book.  This was the first Stephen King book that I'd ever read, and based on my enjoyment of this one, it certainly won't be the last.	2002-08-07
US	50631983	R3V6SOYHJ5SJQB	0426203925	531705686	Iceberg (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Excellent	What a surprise it was for a book written by a TV actor to actually turn out quite well.  When I first realized that ICEBERG was written by the actor who portrayed the Cyberleader in various 80s stories, and featured those nefarious Doctor Who villains, I went in not expecting much at all.  Actually, that's not entirely true; I expected the book to be absolutely awful.  I expected the book to be utterly wrapped up in boring theories about how the various Cyberman stories linked together.  I expected a lot of dull rubbish involving Cyberleaders marching around giving orders to uninteresting Cyberunderlings.  Boy, was I wrong.<br />Apart from some Cyberhistory at the very beginning of the story, the plot rattles along for quite some time without the Cybermen becoming overly involved.  This allows David Banks to slowly begin with details about the supporting characters.  Despite the very leisurely pace, I was never bored by any of the actions.  Indeed, as the story progressed, I found myself very interested in what was being built up around these people, especially Ruby the undercover journalist (she probably would have made a fine companion, though having two in a row who were named after WIZARD OF OZ references possibly would have been stretching things a little).<br />More than anything, I was quite impressed by the quality of the writing.  I assumed that since Banks was primarily known as an actor that he probably wasn't terribly adept at the art of weaving sentences together.  But that isn't the case here.  True, there are a few places where Banks walks on just the wrong side of pretentiousness, but for the most part I found his writing style to be quite appealing.  The plot gets a little rushed at the end, but after the deliberate pace of the beginning, I enjoyed the more frantic parts of the conclusion.  Still, there probably could have been a little more care taken in having the plot reveal itself in a controlled manner.<br />The awaited return of the Cybermenactually turned out surprisingly well.  There are a handful of information dumps to bring the uninformed reader up to speed, but they don't become too overwhelming.  In many ways, this is a sequel of sorts to two of the 60's Cyberman stories, however it certainly isn't a case of just pulling all the same old characters out of mothballs to do the same things they did in the first story.  Instead we merely have echoes of those stories appearing in this one.  We meet people who were affected by previous events, but who didn't actually appear before.  This is an effective way of drawing in the previous tales without treading over the same ground.  Kudos to David Banks for pulling this off so skillfully.<br />While the book is primarily an action-adventure, there are more than enough little moments of introspection to keep the reader interested.  The theme of dehumanization that has been present in so many other Cyberman stories is also on display here, but there is enough of a new spin on the old idea to keep it from feeling tired.  There are also little nods and references to other stories in various mediums, and I was quite amused at every WIZARD OF OZ joke that would pop up.  On the other hand, there are numerous places which would appear to betray ICEBERG as being a terribly cynical book.  The view of Earth's near-future is a grim one, with environmental disatsers looming, and death and disease rampant.  Yet, at the very end there's a simple statement of hope that substantially alters the final tone of the piece.  It's very simplistic, and it doesn't get a lot of the focus of the book, but I found it to be effective, especially given the exact placing in terms of what had come before in the narrative. <br />All in all, ICEBERG was a bit of a surprise for the first time I read it, and again during my recent reread.  The Cybermen return with a lot of menace, and are just as ominous on the page as they were on television.	2002-08-05
US	50631983	R3F28G5V5EI2Z0	1558604286	721748420	Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface	Books	4	24	25	N	N	Great as an introduction, and good as reference material	Rather than being a boring, bland and dry text, COMPUTER ORGANIZATION &amp; DESIGN is a well-written and very informative introduction to many hardware and software fundamentals that should be known by anyone with interest in this field.  It's a little wordier than it probably could be, but I found the style of the writing to be a great help at teaching myself these sometimes obscure topics.  It succeeds at being both a teacher and a reference book.<br />The authors had the clever idea of introducing many of the concepts from a historical perspective, tracing the beginnings of ideas up to their current implementations.  This makes the narrative much less dry than it could have been (let's face it, hardware design isn't exactly riveting material) but makes for a great introduction.  The reader gets to see the concepts develop from simpler ideas into the more complicated set-ups of today.  Putting the models into that context makes the more difficult concepts easier to grasp.<br />Some discussion concerning this text has revolved around its wordiness.  Certainly the book goes into more detail than it probably needs to, and takes longer than necessary to explain certain topics.  But to the student or reader encountering these details for the first time, this approach can be extremely rewarding.  I found this book to be an excellent teacher.  While it took a little bit of time for me to read, it was quite up to the task of clearly and simply explaining the concepts at hand.  Each chapter has a section on Fallacies and Pitfalls, which I found particularly helpful.  They take a number of the most commonly held misconceptions about the material in that chapter, and clearly and carefully explain why such things aren't true.  I found that a lot of what they covered were things that I had either misconstrued or was unclear about so this section was invaluable for me.<br />As reference material, the book covers Processor Performance, Microinstructions, Arithmetic (covers binary and floating-point operations done on the MIPS processor), Processor Pipelining, I/O Interfaces, Multiprocessing, and various other MIPS related subjects.  If you looking for something that's primarily reference material, you could probably find a text out there that's a bit more concise.  But if you're a little rusty on some of these concepts or are encountering them for the first time, then you could do a lot worse than to teach yourself from this book.	2002-08-04
US	50631983	R101YQH1R56XHG	0426203933	605906192	Birthright (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Birthright, done right	BIRTHRIGHT is so superior to Nigel Robinson's previous outing, TIMEWYRM: APOCALYPSE, that I found myself wondering if the little mistakes that cropped up were a deliberate attempt to reassure the reader that both books were written by the same author.  There's very little padding, the plot actually does show up before page one hundred and fifty, and Robinson manages to weave, not one, but two interesting settings into the mix.  The secondary characters are engaging, while the story plays to the strengths of both Benny and Ace.  In short, it's not what I would describe as an utterly fantastic or mind-blowing book, but it's still about a hundred times better than APOCALYPSE. <br />The story is split into two main settings; Benny lands in early 20th Century London, while Ace is flung onto a desert planet in the distant future.  (The Doctor has vanished, presumably gone to the same vacation spots that William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton frequented when their characters would disappear in the middle of a serial.)  The Benny section is quite good.  Ace's portion is satisfactory, but slightly lacking, and fortunately shorter.  The two settings are effectively drawn, with special mention going to the London sections.  It's not a hugely detailed depiction, but the author manages to do a lot of very impressive work with the few brushstrokes that he does create.  The characters in that section aren't especially deep, but they work well in their simplicity.  They're slightly underdeveloped characters that I would like to have seen more of, rather than merely faceless zeros whose deaths I eagerly anticipate.  Credit to Robinson for making quite a bit out of fairly little; apparently years of editing the prose stylings of Terrance Dicks Novelisations-O-Matic paid off after all.<br />Unlike Robinson's previous effort, there is very little padding present here.  The plot is fairly straightforward, but is never simplistic.  The laws of storytelling aren't going to be irreversiblealtered because of this book, but as a fast and fun pulp paperback, it works.  The double setting gives us a slightly larger scale to work with and that makes the story feel the tiniest bit larger than it really is.  It's effective though and adds a nicely structured twist to the plot.<br />There were several minor details that let this book down slightly.  A few awkwardly written sections of prose betray the fact that Robinson has done much more editing of other people's work than has actually written himself.  The flaws are relatively insignificant, but can be distracting in places.  A few sections are indeed written with a lot of flair, but there are one or two glaring portions that contain all the subtlety of the MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMEN cover.<br />Despite this book feeling more mature than APOCALYPSE, it still reads as though it was aimed at a younger audience than most of the surrounding NAs.  Prostitutes, grizzly murders, and seedy night-life are all present, yet much of the time they're written in as near to a PG-rated style as possible.  This isn't a problem; indeed, I quite enjoyed this book, it just feels a little mixed up at times.  Robinson's first book for the series was a mere 201 pages, and was hopelessly padded out to that length.  This book's page-count isn't much longer, weighing in at just 216 pages, but manages not to waste a single one.	2002-08-01

I finished OH NO IT ISN'T! a few days ago, but I'm still not quite sure what to make of it.  It's a fun romp that spends the first hundred pages being absolutely not a romp.  It's a fantastical, farcical fantasy that tacks on a bizarrely scientific ending.  It's concerned with establishing a foundation to the (then) new series of Benny Adventures while also attempting to maintain a standalone tale.  In short, it's doing quite a lot of different things almost at once.  I found it to be enjoyable, but the further into the story I delved, the more restless I became.  <br />The only major problem I found with OH NO IT ISN'T! is that it drags, quite heavily in parts.  It's trying to be light and frothy, but it never seemed to be quite as light as it wants to be.  A secondary (and mostly serious) subplot keeps pulling the action out of fluffville and grounding the entire book so that it never goes quite as far as it could have.  Frivolity is quite a difficult concept to successfully pull off, and I don't think that Paul Cornell totally succeeded.  Certainly there are some remarkably fun pieces, and I was entertained throughout much of the book.  But too much lightheartedness can become tedious, and I found the secondary plot to be mostly distracting.  There are times when the story is neither one thing nor the other.  Had Paul Magrs written this same story he probably would have left out most of the real world portions (including the shaky ending) and moved the plot along faster.  And I probably would have enjoyed that version more than this one.<br />Now, I'm quite willing to concede the possibility that I had less than ideal reading conditions here.  Due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to read the story in the larger chunks that it was probably best suited for.  Breaking it down into smaller pieces and reading only short sections a day can only have hurt this overall experience.  While initially I had been very enthusiastic about the story, pulling thebook out for the third day of Benny still locked in panto-land with no clue as to how to escape began to require more and more effort on my part.  The longer the panto scenes went on, the less desire I felt to pick up the book again.  Nothing seemed to be happening other than pop culture references and word plays.  Obviously, that's the nature of the medium here, but while an actual panto performance doesn't go on for a terribly long amount of time, the same thing in a book requires a greater investment of time from the audience.  The jokes and the puns do manage to liven those sections, but there were many moments where it felt like an uphill battle.<br />OH NO IT ISN'T! can be quite a lot of fun, if you're in the mood for an odd sort of romp through panto-land.  Many of the jokes are devastatingly funny, and there are numerous pop culture references to keep one amused, from the Marx Brothers to Pulp.  As a light and frothy adventurous frolic, it mostly works.  Had the plot moved a bit faster, I probably wouldn't have ended up being as bored by the middle section, but perhaps looking for a quick storyline in a panto is a fruitless task.  On the other hand, it's quite possible that panto is just one of those genres that doesn't translate well to the novel format.	2002-07-24
US	50631983	R3IPXKTCX8APIL	0061043540	815700998	The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club	Books	3	14	18	N	N	Pleasant and whimsical	THE UNPLEASANTNESS AT THE BELLONA CLUB wasn't the best mystery novel that I've ever read, but it was certainly enjoyable enough that I didn't feel I was wasting my energy.  The characters are, at times, clichéd, but I was entertained by all of them enough not to be too bothered by any lack of real substance.  It's a tale of murder, deceit and money, but is told with enough whimsy to make it fully enjoyable.<br />Despite some initial false assumptions on my part, the plot managed to keep me mostly surprised much of the time.  At first glance, I thought that I was in for a fairly tedious journey, as I wasn't very far into the book when I suddenly figured out what I assumed was a large part of the mystery.  Faced with the prospect of having to read through the entire rest of the story pretending not to know how the murderer had gotten away with it, I began to wonder if perhaps the remainder wouldn't be worth reading.  To my great surprise, while the portion of the mystery that I figured out was fairly well signposted, it didn't turn out to be as important as I had anticipated, and I was greatly pleased that Lord Peter figured out the puzzle not long after I did.  This allowed the story to turn into directions that I hadn't anticipated, and brought me back into the narrative.  There are several clever little moments of storytelling that successfully managed to keep my on my toes, which is an ideal situation for any detective story.<br />This was the first Dorothy Sayers book that I've read, and I was surprised at how much of the story was conveyed purely through the dialog.  There is almost no description at all and there were times where it seemed as though I was reading a television or a film script.  (Incidentally, this is probably why the series translates so well to visual mediums.)  This did contribute to a feeling of triviality, but it did make the book pass by much more quickly.  This is not a book to be slowly picked apart, but rather one to be enjoyed quickly, in large gulps.  The fast-pace adds to the fanciful flavor and allows the story to rapidly wash over the reader. <br />I found THE UNPLEASANTNESS AT THE BELLONA CLUB to be a fun and enjoyable, if light, detective adventure.  It's a great little piece of fiction to read on a lazy afternoon, and it should be recommended to any fan of mystery novels.  A short, and fairly unambitious novel, but definitely quite enjoyable.	2002-07-23
US	50631983	R27S5XLWZ6I85J	1556707134	813083900	Bean There Done That: The Life and Times of Rowan Atkinson	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Superficial, but with BIG COLOR PHOTOS	Bruce Dessau has written two books on the life and career of British comedian Rowan Atkinson.  The first one that I read (simply titled ROWAN ATKINSON) was a three hundred and fifty page biography -- a detailed and concise history of the man's television, film, and theatre work.  This volume, BEAN THERE DONE THAT, covers the same material in coffee-table form, but only taking one hundred and twelve pages to do so.  What this book lacks in content, it makes up for in large, glossy, color photographs of the clown himself.  It's a fairly good summary of Atkinson's career, though after reading the more in-depth tome, this slimmer volume can't help but feel watered down.<br />Like Dessau's other biography, this volume has a lot to say about the various characters that Atkinson has created over the years, but very little about his private life.  This omission is more forgivable here, since one probably isn't looking for an enormous amount of insight in a book of this type.  It does do quite a good job at following Atkinson's career and will especially be enjoyed by anyone who isn't overly familiar with some of the television shows he has appeared in that haven't sustained the amount of international exposure as MR BEAN.<br />While BEAN THERE DONE THAT suffers from many of the same flaws as the other Dessau biography, this volume should be recommended to people new to Atkinson's work.  There are some excellent photographs and the text is quite adequate at the task of  describing all of Rowan Atkinson's work (up to the MR. BEAN movie).  It may be a bit too superficial for the Atkinson fans, however, as most of the information included is available in other forms.	2002-07-23

Hearing about Douglas Adams' untimely death was certainly a shock to all of his fans, myself included.  I had been a big follower of his HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE series, I had greatly enjoyed his DOCTOR WHO scripts, and his DIRK GENTLY novels simply get better and better on every read-through.  The thought of a world with nothing more forthcoming from Douglas Adams is simply not a happy one.  However, upon hearing about the release of what existed of his final novel, I'll admit that I was slightly skeptical.  From all reports, Adams was quite a perfectionist, and it seemed clear that whatever was pieced together from his hard-drive would be nothing like what he would have eventually completed.  But now, having read the book, I'm glad that I did so, despite its fragmented style and incomplete status.  It's given us a last look, and for that alone we should be grateful.<br />The book with the words \\"The Salmon Of Doubt\\" on the cover is actually a hodgepodge of various articles, essays, introductions, speeches, odd thoughts and other writings of which the incomplete novel, THE SALMON OF DOUBT, is only a small part.  The non-fiction portion (which accounts for most of the pages) reveals a very witty and intelligent author, who was quite outspoken about those topics close to his heart, and who put those views forward in a thought-provoking and amusing way.  The editor has gamely attempted to organize this collection into groups of similar topics, but to be honest it doesn't feel organized at all.  This is basically just a random compilation of different writings all thrown together into a single volume.  Douglas Adams had far-ranging tastes and interests, and while you will see some recurring topics (his love of the Beatles is omnipresent), you won't find any real sense of coherence.  But you will find a lot of intelligently argued and hilarious essays on subjects as diverse as technology, the environment, P. G. Wodehouse, atheism, and other people's dogs. <br />Reviewing whatexists of THE SALMON OF DOUBT is a very difficult task.  There are a lot of plot points and threads that obviously aren't wrapped up or even properly started.  What is here is great, but would that level of quality be maintained?  Would the plot be continued in a satisfying manner, or would all the clever hints that were dropped be discarded?  It's impossible to determine how the rest of the story would have gone.  The editors give us as much information as they could, but even Douglas Adams apparently hadn't decided whether it would continue to be a Dirk Gently book, or if he would switch it over to his Hitchhikers universe.  The only real way I have of reviewing the tiny (80 pages) block of THE SALMON OF DOUBT is to say that I did enjoy reading it, I'm heartbroken that there isn't any more of it, and I'll certainly reread this in the future.  If only it wasn't so short.<br />If you had any misgivings about reading an incomplete work, then I can only try to persuade you to go ahead and devour this anyway.  A tantalizing fraction of a Douglas Adams book is still better than no Douglas Adams book at all.  The non-fiction writings are provocative and the Hitchhiker humor is displayed on every page.  Take a final stroll through the last words of Douglas Adams; you'll be very sorry that the ride is over, but you'll be glad that you got on board.<br />So long, Doug, and thanks for all the wit.	2002-07-16
US	50631983	RHUHIF5N8MOL9	0553288105	229605670	The Gods Themselves	Books	4	19	20	N	N	The Asimov Himself	There are many topics present in THE GODS THEMSELVES that will be familiar to anyone who has read a good number of the late, great Isaac Asimov's work.  Back-stabbing in the academic world, scientific progress, human folly, fear of outsiders and other themes can be found, not only here, but in countless other short stories and novels written by the good doctor.  Using his accustomed pieces as a springboard, Asimov created in this book an almost epic tale of human hubris as it tries to take advantage of a science that it doesn't even understand.  Despite having a few minor misgivings with the conclusion, I felt that this ranked right up there with the best of his stories.<br />The book is divided into three sections, each telling part of the tale, and each featuring its own cast of characters.  Asimov was clever enough to weave the story carefully so that we get the various portions from three different points of view (this is even cleverer in the middle section but you'll have to read it to find out how).  The themes and tones established at the beginning manage to thread their way through effortlessly, which is quite an achievement given how wildly different the three sections are in terms of setting, characters, and motivations.<br />The middle section of the three could almost be left on the cutting room floor as far as the rest of the plot is concerned.  There is virtually nothing here that isn't revealed or repeated in the other two sections.  But it is this alien-centric passage that makes this book the classic that it is today.  Aliens in science-fiction stories can generally fall into two main categories.  In the first, there are the aliens who look, act and sound exactly like human beings, with the only real difference being that they have pieces of plastic on their foreheads, or can see in the dark, or something else trivial like that.  They don't really have dissimilar minds to humans; they don't think differently.  The second group is the race of creatures of which every individual member is just like every other (watch any episode of Star Trek to see the war-like aliens, or the peace-loving aliens, or the scientific aliens, etc.).  Yet, Asimov managed to do something really special here.  He created a race of beings that are certainly much different from what we would describe as human, but he also made them into interesting individuals.  A triple-gendered species is a difficult concept to develop (especially in novel form), but Asimov did a terrific job here at describing the genders in terms of general archetypes, and then making the individuals interesting in their own right, regardless of their alienness.  <br />One of the only things that I didn't think lived up to the quality of the rest was the ease of the resolution.  It's a bit too simple and slightly too neat.  The conclusion makes logical and scientific sense, but one doesn't get the impression of any real emotion.  It's as if the main characters can really be bothered to get excited over the impending destruction of the solar system.  There's also a subplot that only really gets going very near to the end causing it to appear to have come out of nowhere.  These aren't really major flaws, but they do cause a little but of a comedown after the wonder on display in the first two sections.  It felt a bit as though Asimov had really let himself go wild in the beginning and middle parts, and then forced himself to reign in his story by the end.  A little disappointing, but this is still quite a captivating ride.<br />Like many of Asimov's novels, this is a great book for fans of science fiction or for newcomers to the genre.  There's a little bit of High School physics on display, but don't let that intimidate you, as Asimov's deceptively simple writing style is what made him such a great teacher of all things scientific.  If you've never had the pleasure of reading any of this author's work before, then THE GODS THEMSELVES would be a great place to start.Several of Asimov's favorite subjects are offered here, and this will give you a great overview of his style of storytelling.	2002-07-11

The writing style in evidence here is very close to Groucho's unique manner of speaking that was so prevalent in his movie, radio, and television careers. His train of thought weaves dangerously, one moment he'll be discussing romance in the dark ages, the next he'll be looping back to earlier sentences, picking apart his own grammar or dragging a double entendre from the brink of reason.  The narrative moves quickly and easily, but the reader should be careful, as speedy perusal will cause you to miss some of the subtler jokes.<br />The subject matter is very much a product of its era and its author.  Most of the jokes revolve around how terrible it is to be married, how much of a pain one's wife is, and how much men like to sit around playing poker.  Not to say that the anecdotes and remembrances aren't hilarious, because some of them are painfully funny, but the subject matter is fairly limiting.  Fortunately, Groucho is clever enough to keep the jokes moving so that it doesn't feel like the same story repeated endlessly.  The book is just the right length for the amount of material.  Any longer and it would have seemed repetitious, any shorter and it would have been insubstantial.<br />Not surprisingly, my favorite stories of the bunch were the ones that included cameos from the author's famous siblings.  Harpo and Chico do put in short appearances here, which would give one the impression that some of the stories that are written about here actually happened.  To be honest, most of the anecdotes seem to have been fairly embellished, so to differentiate between what is reality and what is the result of Groucho's mad mind is a game that simply can't be won.  If you're looking for an in-depth and accurate biography of Groucho Marx, then there are loads of other books you should be investigating.  This tome may not tell you much about Groucho Marx, but it wasn't meant to.  It's a cliché to say that a really funny book will cause one to laugh out loud in embarrassingly public places, but clichés like that come about because of hilarious books like MEMOIRS OF A MANGY LOVER.	2002-07-08
US	50631983	RORDKBPX2N9JT	0426203941	668245	Shadowmind (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Drove me out of my SHADOWMIND	I recently unearthed my copy of SHADOWMIND, which had been Missing In Action for the past seven years or so.  The discovery yielded a puzzling result, as there was a bookmark approximately thirty pages from the end of the story, yet I had absolutely no recollection of ever reading any of this.  I vaguely wondered what would have caused me to give up on a book when I had managed to get so close to the conclusion.  Undaunted, I decided to begin reading again from the beginning.  This time would be different.  I would fight on until the very end, defeating any leaden prose, clichéd characters, and banal subplots that dared to stand in my way.  I would fight this through to the bitter end, to win now where I had been defeated seven years ago.  And, after several long days, I succeeded.<br />Ow.<br />Okay, it's not as bad as all that.  The beginning is quite good, and despite some problems with the end, there were several resolutions that I enjoyed.  But the sections in the middle are so dull, so tedious, so devoid of anything remotely fulfilling that I almost gave up on SHADOWMIND for the second time.  Even now, looking back at the events of the past few days, I'm not completely certain how I made it all the way through.  Admittedly, there are more than a few blurry spots in my memory, and I just know there are several chapters that jumped ship before they could be transferred from my short-term to my long-term memory.  But, somehow, I got to the end.  Whew.<br />Anyway, as I indicated, there are some fairly pleasant pieces at the beginning of the story.  The initial setting, where the Doctor, Ace and Benny decide to vacation, has the potential to be an appealing backdrop.  At the other end of the gaping abyss that is the plot, the conclusion has some attractive features as well.  Bulis inserts an interesting piece of angsty material that manages not to be gratuitous or overwrought.  It's a bit contrived, but I felt that it worked.  Perhaps I was merely delirious having just stumbled through the excruciating middle section, but I really was interested in what had been done with New Ace.<br />This interesting stuff from the opening all ends up being abandoned, and, unfortunately, the story is very very slow to actually move on to the later parts.  It's all very well to have an authentic-seeming space opera where it takes multiple days to cross from one planet to another.  But the danger in showing space travel as a boring and time-consuming task is that this can very easily make reading a boring and time-consuming task.  Even the portions that take place on the planet surface are arduous and long.  Yes, it may be quite realistic for complicated military procedures to take place over the course of several days, but, boy oh boy, you'd better have something interesting going on while all the boring marching is taking place.  And there's nothing distracting during these sections at all.  <br />There are lots of trees, to be sure.  Trees don't equal excitement.  And there are loads of extras just itching to be killed off.  Cannon-fodder isn't entirely enthralling either.  Approximately a hundred pages of the book can be summed up in four short sentences:  People show up.  Some are blown up. Others blow up things.  Some do both.  With those four sentences out of the way, you can now safely skip from about page one hundred right through until about twenty or thirty pages from the end.  If you've never read this book and are planning to do so, please don't hesitate to substitute those sentences in.  You'll save yourself many hours and many tears.<br />All that I really got out of the story is that the main villain is apparently some sort of angry adolescent briquette (I'm not making this up) bent on interstellar invasion by using a spaceship equipped with a sphincter (I couldn't make this up).  There's some nice stuff tossed in randomly about making difficult decisions, but that honestly doesn't make the book worth it.  Too many of the action sequences are boring and repetitive.  This is the sort of book where if you accidentally turn over two pages at once, you may find yourself wondering whether it's worth expending the energy it would take to turn back the extra page.<br />But at least I learned why I gave up reading it the last time.	2002-07-04
US	50631983	RVMM2HOUSBIBG	042620395X	488648836	White Darkness (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Big Bad Voodoo Darkness	I found WHITE DARKNESS to be an unambitious but fun adventure that makes great use of its historical setting.  The atmosphere of WWI-era Haiti enhances the narrative, and makes the background come alive.  It adds tension and depth to a story that would otherwise be fairly standard.  There were only a handful of passages that didn't work for me, and while it had some relatively significant flaws they weren't quite enough to disrupt the entirety.<br />The setting is evoked quite effectively; the more historical aspects of the story really shine.  McIntee makes good use of the location, so that it, the people, and the culture are vital to the plot.  Not all of the individual historical figures seem as three-dimensional as they could be, but the surrounding details more than make up for this.  At certain points, I just wanted to soak up the historical facts and ignore the science-fiction story that seemed to be intruding into this nice drama.  The book does a great job of balancing the history with the fiction.<br />A few things pulled WHITE DARKNESS down for me.  Some portions of the prose are extremely awkward, and could have been greatly helped by the editor's red pen.  There are a few sections that don't really have any impact at all upon anything else, and could probably have been removed.  The nature of the enemy was fairly ill-defined, and while this did have certain advantages (it added a bit of mystery and menace) the end result was that it was difficult to feel that this adversary had much strength behind it.  Quite a few pieces suffered from the flaw of telling rather than showing, but to the book's credit, I didn't find that particular shortcoming to be overly disruptive in this case.<br />It's a pity that a scant few problems nearly manage to wreck the rest, as with some mindful editing this could easily have been a much stronger novel.  As it is now, it's still quite entertaining, and I'd recommend it for the setting and the atmosphere alone.  The plot isstraightforward, but not simplistic, and works well in its action/adventure dressing.  An enjoyable way of spending a few hours.	2002-06-28

I'll admit straight off the bat that I'm not a huge fan of stream-of-consciousness narratives.  In fact, I dislike such styles more often than I enjoy them.  ABSALOM, ABSALOM! was also the first work by William Faulkner that I have ever read, which (judging by the reviews on this site) is apparently not the best place I could have started.  Yet despite these potential problems, I quite enjoyed the overall book.  There were several places where I found the narrative voice to be quite tedious, but the story was so captivating that these difficulties were well worth struggling through.<br />As I said, I don't usually like the stream-of-consciousness style of writing.  When done incorrectly, it can lead to books full of hopelessly incoherent rambling that is neither insightful nor interesting.  However, in the case of ABSALOM, ABSALOM!, I'll grudgingly admit that the style does help the story quite a bit.  Some of the asides and passages were extremely effective at conveying the atmosphere of the South during the Civil War.  The various misconceptions that several characters have (the reader can only gradually piece together the truth) are perfectly true to their personalities and reveal more about the people in this story than the actual events would have.  That said, some of the more esoteric portions of the text had me nearly throwing the book across the room in angry confusion.  Fortunately for the sake of my library, my walls and my sanity, those more obscure sections are not terribly numerous, and many of them can become penetrable, albeit after the second or third reading.<br />One of the aspects of the novel I most appreciated was Faulkner's ability to set my expectations in one direction, and then completely pull the rug out from under me.  There were several major twists and turns that I genuinely did not anticipate.  Characters' understandings are fallible, and yet whenever something that someone had said turned out to be false, I never felt cheated.  While alot of the narrative shocks stem from people misunderstanding events from long ago, the mistakes they make are perfectly valid, and I never once felt that Faulkner had deliberately caused people to misconstrue happenings merely to drive the plot.  <br />Racism plays a major part in this story, so be prepared to see some language and activities that aren't politically correct.  Faulkner is showing racism for exactly what it was at the time, an everyday fact of life, and a concept that was applied randomly and irrationally.  He doesn't compromise, but neither does he dwell on this subject.  He records it exactly as he saw it, from a perspective that none of his characters have the benefit of sharing.<br />Despite my own apprehension upon reading the first few pages, I ended up quite enjoying ABSALOM, ABSALOM!.  It took me a couple of chapters before I got into the rhythm of the prose, but once it clicked in my head I was able to read it with very little problem.  If the text looks intimidating at first, I advise you to attempt it anyway to see if you can't wrap your head around it.  I managed to make myself understand it, and I am very glad that I didn't simply give up before the end.  The symbolism, the tragedy, and the bare emotions - they all contribute to making this a fantastic story.  The way that Faulkner manages to portray hopes, dreams, heartbreak, blind ambition, and hubris in a manner than somehow all manages to be perfectly believable is a huge achievement, and something well worth the time it takes to read.	2002-06-25
US	50631983	R334IP0RARPE1M	0060932813	617082594	Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress	Books	2	25	28	N	N	Not quite warm enough	WAITING: THE TRUE CONFESSIONS OF A WAITRESS is a selection of Debra Ginsberg's recollections and stories based on twenty year's worth of waiting tables.  The results are fairly mixed.  While the two decades have given her more than her fair share of horror stories and anecdotes, not all of the tales recounted here come across well.  The style of the book is very off-putting, as many of the accounts could just as easily been compiled by somebody else.  The lack of anything personal really hurts the book, which is quite odd when one considers how much space the author attempts to devote to her own life outside of the apron.<br />While the waitressing stories can oftentimes be quite funny, there is a curious lack of the personal touch among them.  Strangely, I had to continually remind myself that these stories were not being told second-hand.  The stories are not told about a friend of a friend, or nor are they manufactured, but are actually experiences from the author herself.  Yet the viewpoint of the author makes them feel as though they happened to somebody else -- a somebody else who isn't particularly close to the author.  The consequence of this is that the stories feel remote and cold.  Rather than drawing us into her confidence, Ginsberg keeps us at arm's length.  Even more telling is that the author seems trapped between wanting to share some of her personal life with the reader and not wanting to go into any significant detail.  The result is that the memoir seems like neither one thing nor the other, with minor and random facts about herself and her family being thrown into the general whitewash of the rest of the story.  <br />I did enjoy reading the first hundred or so pages.  However, after a certain point, I realized that the book wasn't going to get any more introspective and that the faintly hollow feeling that I experienced from the beginning was going to be present throughout the entire book.  For a three hundred page memoir, this is not somethingthat is going to work well.  Had the book been about half its current length, the lack of depth might not have been as significant a flaw, but to maintain reader interest for that entire length, we really need more interesting material to read about.  The message of this book seems to be that waiters and waitresses are real people with real problems, and sometimes whether or not a customer's lasagna is the optimal temperature isn't the most important thing on his or her mind.  This is indeed an important message, but hardly an Earth-shattering one.  If you are among the few people on the planet who hasn't already realized this fairly simple fact, then not only should you educate yourself with this book, but you must go out immediately, track down every waiter you've ever been rude to, get down on your knees, and apologize profusely.  Everyone else can continue to tip well, but can probably skip this book, as apparently they innately understand what Ginsberg goes to a lot of trouble to explain.<br />Now I don't want to be wholly negative in this review, as there were several anecdotes and stories that I found to be quite amusing.  Yes, funny things can happen in restaurants and there are a number of entertaining stories to be read.  Some of the accounts here, while occasionally repetitive, are sufficiently distracting enough to be enjoyable.  Many of them will have you cringing at the amount of human stupidity displayed by numerous customers of restaurants all across America.  A handful of Ginsberg's fellow co-workers occasionally stand out, and it's a pity that we never get to know more than a scattering of details about any of them.  I get the impression that there were a lot of great stories concerning these people that we never really got the chance to read about.<br />Unfortunately, I can't say that WAITING is a fantastic memoir.  If your reaction to the revelation of waiters and waitresses being actual (and overworked) human beings is to say, \\"Yeah, I knew thatalready,\\" then this book will most likely be a rethread of what you understand to be true anyway.  Maybe it's an inherent property of waitressing that most of the things one learns about people are done so within a short amount of time, leaving little room for deeper thoughts or meaningful reflections.  But these short musings aren't enough to sustain the entire book.  WAITING is only recommended if you genuinely have no idea that waiters are people.	2002-06-24
US	50631983	R1ZOYMEHJXP629	0563538406	542655598	Dying in the Sun (Doctor Who)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A pulpy Twilight Zone	I quite enjoyed the beginning of DYING IN THE SUN.  The story opens with a mock pulp style consistent with the 1940's period in which the book was set.  It eventually moves on from this into a more straightforward Science Fiction tale that isn't quite as gripping.  The book does quite a lot of things well, but unfortunately it does almost an equal number of things poorly.  While I did leave the book feeling positive, there were several points along the way that made enjoyment feel like an uphill battle, as if the narrative was occasionally insisting that I dislike it.  It didn't totally succeed, but I can't shake the feeling that the book could have been much more interesting than it was.<br />The dime novel feel to the beginning of the story was quite effective at evoking the setting and capturing the mood of the genre it was mimicking.  It's not the most original pulp style ever seen in a novel, as it mostly follows the conventions of that genre rather than subverting them or offering up anything new.  Still it makes for a fair enjoyable read, if one likes that sort of writing, and I found it to be quite entertaining.  The crew of the Second Doctor, Ben and Polly seemed to fit right into this type of storytelling, and putting that team into this setting was a risk that mostly succeeded.  Upon reflection, I think I would have preferred to see the entire book written in this style rather than having it phased out halfway through.<br />The replacement to the pulp is a portion of the story that would feel right at home on The Twilight Zone.  These sections are fairly successful as well, though I found them less engaging than the opening passages.  The eventual menace is an interesting idea, though it lacks a certain something in execution.  Maybe it's because we never get an adequate explanation of what the eventual goal of the aliens is.  Perhaps the lack of explanations about the nature of the creatures is what leads to the unsatisfying ending.  Whatever the reason,there simply wasn't enough \\"oomph\\" to the aliens.  And this is a problem mainly because the human spokesman for the villains isn't all that interesting either.  It seems frustrating to see a baddie fall back on the same motivations and plot devices that we've seen before.  There were glimmers of potential, but very little of that manifested itself in the adversaries.<br />The Doctor and his companions are portrayed adequately, but not excellently.  Jon De Burgh Miller gets much of Troughton's Doctor correct, though there are several passages that seemed quite out of character.  Still, the Second Doctor is notoriously difficult to capture in print, and the depiction here is better than others have attempted.  I'm much more familiar with Ben and Polly through their outings in the old Target novelisations than in their televised episodes, and their characterization here certainly seemed consistent with my memories of those books.  It's only a pity that Ben has so little to do, with most of the attention focused on Polly.  Fortunately, Polly more than carries the slack.  There were a few places where her motivation seemed a little over the top, but for the most part she was a believable and noteworthy character.<br />Ultimately, I think the story could have done quite well with some tighter editing, or another draft.  I found myself enjoying the story, but slight and avoidable oversights kept jumping out to annoy me.  No major mistakes caused me to hurl the book across the room; rather there was an accumulation effect as all the small individual cuts took their toll.  Small oddities in the narrative, \\"revelations\\" that came out of nowhere, and coincidences just slightly too big to be believable all added up.<br />While DYING IN THE SUN has a couple of flaws that annoyed me, I managed to enjoy enough of the story not to be too bothered by them.  There are portions that just appear to be sloppy, but the narrative moves fast enough for these not to be a big problem.  There are a few missed opportunities, but overall it's relatively enjoyable and works fairly well as a simple, undemanding story.  I did find quite a lot to like, and it's a fairly fun tale, but I couldn't quite describe it as anything more than average.	2002-06-17

Given that this was a volume based upon a writer struggling in the clutches of the dreaded Writer's Block, this disorganization failed to surprise me.  I enjoyed the book far more than I thought I would given the amount of reviews that emphasized the mental frustrations.  And while a significant number of pages are dedicated to aborted novels, they don't totally dominate the entirety.  Yes, on the surface, the book is a flimsy narrative stringing together numerous and seemingly random ideas.  On the other hand, as with most of Heller's writings, there is method to this madness and I found the complete story to be quite rewarding.<br />The fictional life of the narrator is threaded inside the various stories that he begins and abandons during the course of the book.  Presumably, Joseph Heller was doing something similar in putting aspects of his own life inside this book, and it's difficult to tell where one can draw the line between fiction and reality.  This was a hallmark of some of Heller's previous works, so fans of his wit will no doubt enjoy the elusive qualities of the fiction as much as I did.  It's amusing to catch references inside the fragmented stories to others in the collection, as well as allusions to the life of the narrator and to the work and life of Heller himself.  I found myself having to mentally pause while absorbing the book to figure out if a detail that I had just read was something out of the fictional author's life, the actual author's life, or something that was completely new.  I found it amusing to try to keep all of the various facts together.<br />Although overall the story moved very quickly, I felt that there were a few portions that dragged.  The majority of the fractional stories are interesting, but there are a few that stick out as being tedious, unworkable and flat.  It's occasionally hit and miss, though one suspects that this is the point of including them all.  Some story seeds seem to have potential while others are a waste of time, and it's up to the author to sort the gems from the trash.  Unfortunately, while this may give one an insight into the mind of a writer, it doesn't always yield material that one would want to sit down and read about.<br />While being a far cry from Heller's more dense novels, PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS AN OLD MAN does exactly what it sets out to do.  It's the bittersweet, final novel from someone who always had something interesting to say, even if he didn't always know what to say next.  One can easily picture Joseph Heller as the cranky, cantankerous old writer looking for one final great masterpiece.  While this book isn't the brilliant work of genius that the fictional writer was aspiring to, it is an interesting look at the search for inspiration.	2002-06-13
US	50631983	R178HFOX70W07K	0426203887	892516142	Lucifer Rising (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Authors Rising	When seeing the two names listed as authors and then looking at the size of LUCIFER RISING (it was the longest New Adventure when it was first released), I had to wonder if perhaps some editing would have been in order.  Now after reading it, I would say that my hunch was vaguely correct, but that those problems don't have a hugely adverse effect.  The book could have done with either a little more editing or perhaps another draft, but these complaints are minor enough to not stand in the way.  <br />Despite its length, LUCIFER RISING still doesn't quite manage to flesh everything out to its potential.  Rather it uses its size to add more plot threads and intriguing characters than the average New Adventure would contain.  The leisurely pace allows the characters and setting to develop gradually, and the result is quite effective.  We get a very good feel for these people and their situation, so we really empathize with them when everything starts going wrong in later chapters.  The scale feels much larger here than it does in the general Doctor Who story.  True, this is a story does span a planetary system, but even the scale of the plot has a larger feeling.  The authors aim big and they achieve much of what they attempt.<br />Some of the prose is quite fantastic.  Not only are the authors (well, one of them at least) adept at the art of creating three-dimensional characters, but much of the imagery contained here is awe-inspiring.  The hard science-fiction concepts of the beginning sections are fleshed out in a sublime fashion that manages to be both detailed and epic.  Instead of the familiar Doctor Who characters and themes being dominated by the sheer size of the story, the regulars fit comfortably inside this weighty science-fiction story.  <br />I quite enjoyed LUCIFER RISING.  I liked the slow start; the science-fiction concepts are handled quite well and the authors don't let them fall into clichés.  While the book goes more in the direction of having lots of fairly developed characters rather than fewer but more distinct people, this does work to its advantage.  Parts of the book seem slightly fragmented, but this was definitely a story that I appreciated.	2002-06-03
US	50631983	R5RMWDZMOUHAN	056353835X	981528903	The Slow Empire (Doctor Who)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Slow Pirates!	THE SLOW EMPIRE is a mostly enjoyable romp consisting of a collection of more or less standalone set pieces that only tie together at the very end. The plot connecting them is paper thin, and isn't all that enthralling, but what is recommended about this book is its great central concept and the irrelevant asides that take up most of its pages. <br />The basic concept behind the book is that the TARDIS has landed in a strange portion of space where traveling faster than the speed of light is impossible. In an Empire spanning multiple worlds and various star systems, this means that journeys between planets will literally take hundreds of years. It's an interesting twist to have the characters suddenly finding themselves stuck in an Einstein-ruled universe. All of Dave Stone's descriptions of this Empire at the beginning of the book are wonderful. Stone cleverly portrayed this section of space in the epic manner that it deserved, reminding me somewhat of the galaxy-spanning society that Isaac Asimov created in his Foundation series. Unfortunately, while the accounts at the start of the story paint a vast, sprawling and fairly out-of-touch galactic empire, they fade a bit as the protagonists start venturing out into the universe. The book is too short to give each planet a distinctive feeling, and the result is to end up with a handful of mostly faceless worlds that appear as though they're reusing the same sets with a slightly different colour of paint slapped on them. Still, the set up was very nice and depicted quite vividly. <br />I'm not quite sure what was going on with the Doctor in this one. The author goes out of his way to state that the Doctor is regressing into the lives of his previous selves, but I couldn't figure out what story reason this served. At first, I assumed that it was an excuse for poor characterization (although the Doctor is portrayed fairly well for most of the book). Upon reflection I wondered if there wasn't a comparison going on betweenthe Seventh and Eighth Doctors. Certainly at the end of the book, the Doctor turns out to have been fairly manipulative throughout much of the story, but almost nothing is made of it. In fact, the ending of the story seems to mirror similar events at the climax of the previous story, THE YEAR OF INTELLIGENT TIGERS, but is done here with so much less subtlety that the point lacks focus. <br />Where the book succeeds are the points in which the plot is turned off and the story veers wildly from one setting to another. Some might say that all this stuff is merely padding and that it doesn't affect the plot one jot (Anji would be one of those people, as she even remarks upon it during the course of the adventure). These people would be absolutely correct. But far from being a criticism of the book, this actually provides us with the more entertaining sections. Bad padding may be a terrible and boring thing to read, but the padding on display here is of a far higher quality than that. It's enjoyable and amusing. <br />Of course, not every aside and irrelevancy ends up as a positive aspect. There are several cases where Stone's excesses cause inward groaning. The awful similes and metaphors of previous books are back and at times they are quite distracting. Some of the prose tiptoes into the wrong side of pretentiousness causing much annoyance and rolling of eyes. As mentioned earlier, the plot really isn't all that interesting when said and done; the voyage itself is what is appealing, not the details behind it. <br />All over, this is an enjoyable tale that skimps a bit on the plot, but is still a lot of fun. The digressions and tangents work more often than they don't, resulting in a pleasant read. It's only a pity that at the end the plot comes back into play, as that section is far less interesting than the diversions that came before. The book isn't the deepest or most taxing thing that you'll ever encounter, but it's certainly amusing and a fun way to spend several hours.	2002-05-30
US	50631983	R3JUH5CXPSCRTL	0743411463	538304275	The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Cuckoo's Egg-cellent	Truth is often stranger than fiction, though it isn't always as interesting.  THE CUCKOO'S EGG is the exception, giving us a tale just as exciting as any best-selling, fictional thriller and yet is entirely factual.  Who would have guessed that such an exhilarating adventure could be totally enclosed in the not-entirely-sexy world of computer networks and security?  <br />THE CUCKOO'S EGG is a fascinating story that began with a minor discrepancy on a small computer network in Berkeley and ended in an international sting operation.  Cliff Stoll was the astronomer-turned-programmer who was on the trail of the mysterious hacker, and he tells the story quite well.  This is a suspense filled tale of tracking this burglar to his lair, of frustrating red herrings and of maddening bureaucracy that stands in the scientist's way.<br />There are one or two places that don't flow quite as smoothly as they would have had the author been a professional writer and not an astronomer/computer-engineer.  He also tends to be a bit repetitive in his discussions and his repeating of his philosophies.  But, as I mentioned, this is from a scientist, not an English major, and his style does have a charm of its own.  It helps the story feel more like something that's happening to just an average kind of guy, which is a great aid to heightening tension, and also helps carry the computer-illiterate reader.  Despite having to convey some relatively difficult concepts, Stoll does an excellent job at explaining networks, operating systems, programming logic and other computer activities with a minimum of confusion.  And while the average reader is gaining insight into the world of computer, the advanced, 21st Century computer operator may find something to feel nostalgic about in this story of late-80's computer networks.<br />I can easily recommend this book to anyone regardless of his or her prior knowledge of computers.  While on the surface this is a story about breaking into electronic equipment, the appealing aspects of the story lie in the mystery itself, not necessarily in the tools of the trade.  What this all boils down to is a good old-fashioned game of cops-and-robbers, when computer networks and Internet security were still only in their infancy.	2002-05-30
US	50631983	R1SMSK8VGAWREK	0262032937	724287306	Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition	Books	3	198	218	N	N	A definitive guide, but not perfect	INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHMS is pretty much the standard textbook in the field of algorithms.  In its favor is the fact that it is quite comprehensive, covering a wide range of topics that the beginning student will need to know.  On the other hand, it has a tendency towards the confusing and the obscure, with many of the example problems not making a lot of sense.  If one decides to purchase this book (and the students will have no choice in this matter, being subject as they are to the whims of their professors), then I recommend that one immediately prints out the \\"bug correction\\" page available on the web, as there are several major howlers present in the book, and if one isn't careful then many hours will be lost while one checks and rechecks faulty pseudo-code.  In one particularly confused portion of the book, the correction sheet completely replaces three entire pages of the text.<br />This book covers a huge amount of material, and many of the topics are described quite adequately.  Although readers may already be familiar with the numerous data structures that are discussed, the book doesn't assume prior knowledge and goes into quite a lot of detail concerning them.  These sections, in particular, are illustrated clearly and offer great reference material that every programmer should have access to.  This portion on data structures is one area where the book's conciseness is an advantage.  It's simple enough for the beginner to learn from, but it contains more than enough information for the advanced user in need of mental refreshing.<br />The opening sections that discuss the rudiments of algorithm analysis are also covered competently.  The easier subjects don't suffer from the book's shortcomings, as these ideas aren't quite as difficult to understand.  For a simple introduction to the easier-to-grasp concepts in Algorithms, these sections simply can't be bettered.  It's not until later chapters that some of the material appears incomprehensible.<br />Other parts of the book are very confusing to the beginning students who, presumably, make up the bulk of the target audience.  If this text is used as an accompaniment to a class (as it usually is), then you'll probably do all right.  One really needs to have some other source of information, because this book tends to get quite confusing.  The problem sets included are frequently obscure, and don't always relate to the material in that chapter.  The fact that many of the problems have no given solution (even if one attempts to contact the authors!) is quite telling.  The style of the book is extremely dry and occasionally impenetrable, even when compared to other computer science textbooks. <br />If you're looking at this page, then no doubt you're looking mainly for pricing information, since this book is the definitive standard on the subject.  Keep in mind that \\"definitive\\" doesn't necessarily mean perfect, and, alas, this book is far from perfection.  But if you have an alternative method of learning the material, then this is an excellent book to have as accompaniment.  And once you've learned the material, you'll find this to be a great resource.	2002-05-28

Giant Rocks About To Sneeze; you can't beat that.  <br />The book begins slowly, and the quiet opening sections had me fooled into thinking this was going to be an absolutely brilliant story.  There are nice quiet little character moments that hint at a story written with a lot of care.  There are instances of surreal insanity that actually work.  Several plot lines are developed at once, and each one manages to be both interesting and engaging.  Parts of the narrative seem slightly confusing at first glance, but careful reading reveals a fairly complicated story apparently being built up.<br />A large and pointless action/battle sequence at about the halfway mark signals the beginning of the book's dive into tedium.  It's dull, it's overly macho, it seems unending, and, unfortunately, it sets the tone for the rest.  At some point along the line, everything that had been carefully developed was thrown aside in favor of senseless and dull action scenes.  Writing a captivating battle sequence takes a lot of skill; one can't simply have a list of things that exploded and expect the audience to stay interested.  Regrettably, PDE's writing simply isn't up to the level needed to keep the reader's attention.  <br />While the beginning of the book showed promise, this isn't a New Adventure that I can recommend.  It has several good moments in it though, and if you skip ahead during the gunfights, then the book may just be about worth it.  However, reading DECEIT in its entirety will almost make you forget about the good stuff that was buried in among the nonsense.   Read it to see what happens to Ace, but don't be afraid to skip ahead during the fights; you won't be missing out on anything.	2002-05-24
US	50631983	R230SZRK1VX56V	0060936142	826438700	Mike Nelson's Mind over Matters	Books	4	21	23	N	Y	The Second Book Featuring Mike Nelson's Head On Its Cover	Well, they did it.  They finally did it.  The Great Gods of the Publishing World have released another book with a picture of Mike Nelson's head on the cover, and, I must say, it's holding up fairly well.  It's a little worn since the last time we saw it, and the little pieces of popcorn that used to surround it have now been replaced (possibly eaten) by remarkably formal thought-bubbles that sprout out of it.  The energetic, insane grinning of MOVIE MEGACHEESE has now faded to a slightly baffled midwestern look of mild tolerance (though, upon reflection, if the phrase \\"My Shorts Can Talk\\" was popping out of my head, I'd be wearing a similar expression).  The head of Mike Nelson has also rejected the more modern flavor of so-called \\"color\\" photography and is now sporting a classic \\"black and white\\" look.  Same haircut though.<br />As for the words that are printed on the pages that lie beneath the Head of Mike Nelson, well, they're pretty funny too (especially the order that he puts some of them in).  The essays collected here are a fairly random group of observations on everyday life.  They're vaguely ordered into a loose grouping of nine categories, but he rarely feels the need to be bound by them.  The book is a free-flowing river of comedy that runs in many different directions, sometimes at the same time.<br />Nelson really has a gift for coming up with hilarious turns of phrase.  He has a wonderful way of describing even the most mundane of everyday tasks in a wickedly amusing manner.  Make no mistake; this is no simple Seinfeldian \\"Did you ever notice...?\\" type of humor, but rather stretching the commonplace until it you see it through Mike's skewed and offbeat point-of-view.  Who would have thought that a simple visit to the neighborhood Radio Shack could be fraught with such unrelenting horror (well, apart from anyone who has ever visited their neighborhood Radio Shack)?  After reading this, it's frighteningly easy to imagine Mike Nelson taking several months off to \\"research\\" this book, where the \\"research\\" consists of arranging an interview with his shorts, reading Schopenhauer, and voyaging through the dark side of his wife's skin care collection.<br />In short, this is funny stuff.  While a slight handful of the essays aren't quite as funny as they should be, there is more than enough funny material to make this a highly recommended read.  If Nelson hits a subject that isn't particularly amusing, you only have to wait for another page or two for him to burst out in an entirely different direction.  Fans of his first book, or his MST3k work should be very happy with this.  And if you're someone who has never experienced this brand of bizarre entertainment before, MIND OVER MATTERS is definitely a great place to start.	2002-05-20
US	50631983	RDZREARXML8T3	0563538481	132158964	Trading Futures (Doctor Who)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The name's Who.  Doctor Who.	I should start off this review by admitting that I am not a huge fan of the James Bond movies.  I have nothing against them, and, indeed, if pressed, I can spend a pleasant Sunday afternoon watching one (provided that there's nothing more interesting on television).  They're fluffy, but it's a fluff that I can find vaguely enjoyable, even if I wouldn't go out of my way to obtain that aforementioned fluff.  I just find them to be a bit lacking, in the seen-one-seen-them-all sense.  The relevance to TRADING FUTURES is that this book is heavily influenced by that series of movies, and while it definitely has positive features that mostly outweigh its flaws, it will probably appeal more to Bond fans than it did to me.<br />I found the action sequences here to be much more interesting and entertaining than similar scenes found in other, more explosion-driven EDAs.  Usually during such sequences I find myself peeking forward, secure in the knowledge that all I need to get out of such a scene is who emerged victorious, and who died a hideous and violent death.  But in TRADING FUTURES the pacing is balanced just perfectly so the battle sequences never seem to go on for too long.  The sometime-in-the-not-too-distant-future setting allowed Parkin to invent some very interesting and clever scenarios involving futuristic war technology, which was most helpful in keeping my interest.<br />The future setting was constructed very carefully and provided many of the best jokes. Lance Parkin obviously had a lot of fun stretching the business, technological, and political practices of today into absurd (and often hilarious) caricatures.  It's written in a quick and amusing style that gives the impression of something not to be taken completely seriously.  And in that way it ends up being fairly enjoyable.  Even some of the portions that could be read as being padding end up adding a lot to the lightweight and entertaining atmosphere.  While Fitz does get sidetracked for at least a portion of the story, his subplot had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion.  I have nothing against padding, as long as it's entertaining, and in the hands of a good writer like Parkin, Fitz can be wildly entertaining.<br />Surprisingly for a Lance Parkin book, none of the secondary characters jump off of the page.  I suppose this is the nature of the genre, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed at the lack of any emotional connection with the people in this story.  They do not fall into the trap of being indistinct, but even their uniqueness doesn't feel particularly inspired.  Everyone has their purpose in the story and executes their role adequately; I just couldn't imagine any of these people existing outside of the confines of this particular tale.  They were caught somewhere between being realistic characters and mere plot ciphers.  This is a shame, especially when one notices how well defined the Eight Doctor himself is in this story.  A pity that not everyone ended up being quite so adequately explored.<br />The story was fast-moving, and well constructed with all the pieces fitting together satisfactory.  And yet, it didn't seem entirely engaging or consequential.  It felt a bit slight and at no point did I really think that anything was going to go seriously wrong for the Doctor and his companions.  I wasn't worried about whether he was going to win, nor was I finding myself totally interested in how he would escape from temporary dangers.  Again, I realize that many of these faults are due to this being a James Bond pastiche and James Bond simply doesn't lose.  As I think about this, I am beginning to conclude that, at least in book form, perhaps these two particular styles don't mesh together as well as one might imagine.  There was a lack of tension, and events didn't seem as substantial as they should have.  <br />The James Bond movies that I have enjoyed have been largely those that have enough style to rise above anything that they lack insubstance.  Ultimately, TRADING FUTURES does barely manage to do that.  It's a fun book with a lot of good jokes, but it lacks the emotional impact of JUST WAR or FATHER TIME, and neither does it contain the sheer epic scale of THE INFINITY DOCTORS.  Paradoxically, the lightweight feel is both the story's strongpoint as well as its greatest weakness. The book doesn't aim terribly high, but it does manage to hit that target.  As a light and breezy read that will help one pass a few hours quickly, TRADING FUTURES is effective.  But it probably won't be a book that you'll be mulling over for very long.	2002-05-17

The beginning felt slow and unengaging.  The characters that Jonathan Morris introduced initially failed to interest me.  But as the book progressed I found myself becoming more and more intrigued by the story-line and the carefully constructed plot.  By the time I reached the end, I had become completely engrossed, and I was still thinking about the complexities of the plot for some time after I completed the book.<br />ANACHROPHOBIA is mainly a plot-driven story and it seems clear that there must have been a very complicated outline behind this book.  It's a story that involves a lot of messing around with time travel and related temporal jiggery-pokery, but everything fits together just perfectly.  The plot has been meticulously structured, yet it is never obscure or confusing.  While it takes a little time to get started, once you get into the story, it never lets you go.  Even some spots in the middle of the book that seemed like unrewarding padding take on a new meaning as later events unfold.  It's a clever and well told story that carefully reveals just enough of the plot along the way to keep one's interest, but not so much that the reader figures out what is going on before the characters do.<br />The characterization of the Doctor is another aspect of the novel that I initially thought I was going to hate.  The Doctor spends far too much time at the beginning doing little apart from a lot of grinning. I was hoping that this wasn't going to be an unwelcome flashback to the ineffectual, smiling Eighth Doctor Idiot of many of the pre-BURNING books.  My fears were for naught.  Morris manages to slowly increase the Doctor's role as the story progresses until, by the time one reaches the end, the Doctor has taken the center stage and is the powerful, intelligent and eccentric character he always can be.  The Doctor is the center of the Whoniverse, and the last fortypages do a marvelous job of demonstrating this.<br />On the other hand, many of the secondary characters fall into the trap of being distinguished almost solely by their job description.  Near the halfway point in the story, Morris attempts to give some of them a dose of much needed humanization, and only has mixed results.  This additional characterization (done almost purely for plot related reasons) manages to triumphantly pull some of the individuals out of the whitewash, but for others the undertaking mostly falls flat.  I enjoyed the clever attempt to base some of the plot around key moments in the lives of the characters, but I don't think it was an entirely successful effort.<br />Still, the thoroughly engaging plot and the wonderful use of the Doctor more than make up for any misfires on other fronts.  It's great to get a book on time travel that makes heavy use of the device and manages to stick so well to its internal logic.  Morris made the art of explaining complicated plots look easy, and he effortlessly constructed an engaging, compelling tale.  Definitely a book to enjoy.	2002-05-13

Interesting clues about the plot are dropped early on, and were effective enough at piquing my interest to make me curious about what was going to happen next.  Unfortunately, the book failed to deliver and a promising start led to a complete misfire. The fact that this story began with such an interesting premise makes the incoherent mess that follows seem that much more unfair.<br />THE HIGHEST SCIENCE attempts to do quite a number of things at once, and manages to fail at just about all of them.  Parts of the story seem light-hearted and camp, but it's campiness without being fun, which just makes the whole thing just look silly.  The villains are over the top, stopping just short of twirling their mustaches and tying Benny to a railway line.  As has been stated many times before, there's a fine line between parodying bad action-adventure clichés, and merely rewriting those same clichés over again.  Unfortunately, this book fell into the latter and not the former of those categories.<br />The plot had a certain amount of potential when the book started, but the amount of padding severely hurts the overall effect.  Characters get lost, wander around, become distracted by random events, etc., etc.  Entire stretches occur in which not a single thing advances the story.  In some books, this isn't necessarily a problem, as padding can reveal interesting character moments, or amusing conversations, but there is none of that to be found here.  One can almost see the author getting bored with the story as one continues along.  Plot threads are dropped and then never recovered.  The prose becomes rushed, and hurried.  Story-telling is replaced by padding.  It's corridor-running, but in book form and without much in the way of entertaining dialog.<br />In other parts of the book, the author goes for a militaristic style and isn't entirely successful here either.  The introduction of a new race of military-driven aliens would have been much more interesting had the creatures actually displayed any original characteristics at all other their physical appearance.  They're the same boring, conquer-the-universe-at-all-costs monsters that we've seen over and over again.  They have a few good moments, but for the most part I was utterly bored every time they took the stage.<br />None of the characters manage to rise above the status of one-dimensional, and this sadly includes the regulars.  The Doctor exists purely as some sort of generic collection of mannerisms, and Benny spends so much time in a drug-induced stupor that we never really get much in the way of development.  Most annoying of all, near the end of the book, even Benny remarks on how out of character she is behaving because of the strange drugs she was accidentally taking.  It's an excuse, and a lame one at that.<br />All in all, I can't say that I enjoyed much of anything in THE HIGHEST SCIENCE.  One or two occasions of humour actually work, but not enough to out-weight the plodding nature of the story.  The ending of the book is one of the biggest cop-outs ever observed in a Doctor Who tale, and it's a wonder that it ever got past the editor.  Ripping off the climax to TIMELASH is not the way to go in Doctor Who story-telling.  From the hideous cover that features a claymation Seventh Doctor (who seems to be contemplating flipping the bird to the audience) to the awkward nature of much of the prose, this is not one of the NAs that I will be rereading in a hurry.	2002-05-05

Carol Rosenblum Perry squeezes a lot into this thin volume, but wastes very little space.  The author writes in a direct and to the point manner, so anyone afraid of reading pages and pages of dry material would do well to try this handy little book.<br />Many of the major discussion topics occupy less than a couple of pages, and this quick style really works to the benefit of the reader.  The author will typically mention a topic in clear, easy-to-understand language, maybe give an example, and then swiftly move on to the next topic.  The subject matter manages to cover virtually everything that the to-be technical writer would need to have a firm understanding of, including: how to construct a good framework, how to be concise, how to use language effectively, how to write an effective ending, and how to avoid the inevitable bout with writer's block (something familiar to everyone who does technical writing work).<br />I found this to be a very uncomplicated book that can be finished in a single sitting if desired.  As a resource, it's a fairly handy volume to keep around as the shortness of the individual topics makes for fast referencing.  In only one hundred pages the book manages to cover a wide range of topics, from the nitty-grittiness of grammar to making your writing flow smoothly to enhancing your prose style.  Recommended for anyone learning how to write technical papers, or even for those who are already experienced but seeking to improve their writings.	2002-04-26

The plot is familiar, and feels uninspired.  Only a handful of things try to pull the story out of the standard conventions.  And while those hopeful moments are very good for what they are, they aren't quite enough to pull the entirety of the book out of the wastelands of mediocrity.<br />The setting for HOPE is a result of some fantastic pieces of writing, and one wishes that the plot that took place in this location could have matched it.  Hope, a city in the far distant future on the planet Endpoint, is a gigantic metal structure, constructed on the top of massive metal legs that keep its inhabitants relatively safe from the poisonous, acidic seas of the planet below.  It's a city of twisted girders, metallic walkways and ominous shadows.  The people who live there believe they are among the last vestiges of humanoid life in the universe.  With only a few exceptions, they are poor, they are hungry, they steal what they can get, and protect what they steal with their lives.  Hope is a gritty and strange place.  It, of course, looks absolutely nothing like the New York Sitting On A Layer Of Toothpicks image that for some reason made it onto the front cover.<br />A major flaw in HOPE is that the break between the two primary parts of the story stretches on for slightly too long.  While reading, it seems that everything has been solved by page 170, and even the TARDIS regulars start remarking on the fact that they should have moved on by now.  It takes far too much time for the next part of the story to begin and this error could have been so easily avoided.  The story doesn't bounce back quickly enough, and as a result, the book suffers for it.  And, unfortunately, when the book does come sputtering back to life, it's far less interesting than it was before.  The main secondary character goes from being an interesting person and concept in his own right to being a clichéd and tired villain that we've seen many times before.<br />The plot is really too lightweight to support that kind of breaking up of the action.  The book begins as a relatively engaging whodunit that starts off with a lot of potential.  Doctor Who usually does this sort of thing well, and the atmosphere that's created here does a lot to inspire confidence about the eventual progress of the book.  Unfortunately, while the mystery is appealing, it's not overly complicated, and is therefore not able to be sustained for the entirety of the book.  The Doctor solves the mystery at about the halfway point, and the plot quickly degenerates from there.<br />On the other hand, Clapham executed a handful of small moments so expertly, that one wishes that the entire book had been made up of these little gems.  There's a two-page section near the end told from the point of view of a lowly evil lackey.  Near the beginning, a casually discarded apple core in the Doctor's pocket helps revive a long dead species of fruit.  Anji faces a difficult decision, and her reaction to is handled amazingly well and with quite a lot of maturity.  She manages to become a realistic human being, and one who isn't overwhelmed by sentimentality.  The choice that she makes reflects careful calculation, albeit one that's obviously being tempered by some serious emotions.  It would have been extremely easy for this sort of thing to turn out horribly (indeed, when I saw what was coming, I began to brace myself) but it's managed with extreme confidence and care.<br />It's a shame that these moments that I mentioned are only moments and not the tone of the whole story.  Had the entire book been written at this level, then we would have been looking at one of the best Doctor Who stories of all time.  Unfortunately, these are only brief looks at a greater work that we see through the cracks in HOPE.  The flimsiness of the plot means that the story feels as though it were stretched far past the author's ability to adequately pad.  HOPE probably would have made for an excellent Telos novella, but as a full-length novel, it just doesn't quite work as well as it should.	2002-04-23
US	50631983	R1OLQLEY3KD7KV	0563538457	316791918	Doctor Who: Mad Dogs and Englishmen (Doctor Who (BBC))	Books	4	6	8	N	N	More Camp Than A Holiday With John Inman	Pity the eyes of the Doctor Who fan.  In November of 2001, the BBC published THE ADVENTURESS OF HENRIETTA STREET - a book written in such a small font that it's currently being used as a calibration device for electron microscopes.  After numerous readers were spotted literally bleeding from the eyes due to excess squinting, reports of blindness spread throughout fandom faster than casting rumors about Ken Dodd.  \\"The BBC,\\" up-in-arms fans demanded, \\"will have to do something about this state of affairs!  No more janus thorns!  No more tiny print!  No more making our eyeballs bleed!  Have pity on our orbs of sight!  Give us something soothing to look at!\\"  And in their wisdom the BBC, upon hearing these pleas of mercy from our optically challenged fans friends (of which this humble reviewer counts himself as a fully paid up member), decided to follow ADVENTURESS with a new book from Paul Magrs.  A new book about poodles.  A new book with a bright pink cover, featuring a bright pink poodle reclining on a yellow sofa, holding a cigarette and a yellow water pistol.  In case there were any optic nerves that hadn't spontaneously combusted upon initial viewing of this cover, there is also a giant reflective Doctor Who logo on the front, that screams to anyone who will listen about how there are now one hundred BBC Doctor Who Novels in existence (I can only assume that a cover claiming that this is the one hundredth book since the BBC took the license away from Virgin didn't go over terribly well in the board meetings).  So, in case you missed anything, there's a bright, shiny, reflective gold logo glowing on top of a screamingly bright pink cover published right after November's Hold-The-Book-Very-Close-To-Your-Head fest.  Why does BBC range editor Justin Richards hate my eyes so?<br />Personally, I think the cover is one of the most killingly funny things I've even seen on the front of the book in a very long time.  On the other hand, I have absolutely no wish to persuade that of anyone who happens to think that it is the most garish and ugly work that they've ever seen in their life (I would probably only mention the fact that they seem to be completely missing the point).  The extreme pinkness of the cover is something that someone is going to either love or abhor and there's absolutely no reason to try to dissuade a person from their opinion on that.  While fans will forever be divided on that subject, the book itself is quite a lot of fun.  It is the epitome of romp.  It is the embodiment of camp.  It is the quintessence of silliness.  It's great.<br />For those readers who thought that all books following THE ADVENTURESS OF HENRIETTA STREET would end up being massively heavy books, have no fear.  MAD DOGS is possibly one of the lightest books that the Doctor Who range has ever produced.  The novel is so light that while I put the book aside during breaks in reading, if it was not for the weight of the bookmark that I shoved into its pages, I would be in eternal fear of the novel being caught on a stray current of air and floating away to some unknown destination.  (For any overly sensitive review-reader who is worried about the fate of my copy now that the bookmark has been removed from MAD DOGS' innards need fret no more.  My copy is now resting comfortably on my bookshelf next to a copy of ADVENTURESS, and the gravitational pull of that tome will keep MAD DOGS securely anchored to the Earth for many many years to come.)<br />In addition to be a delightfully quick book to read, it's also a terribly funny one.  MAD DOGS is one of the few Doctor Who stories where virtually every joke or bad pun creates a laugh.  Not a book to be taken seriously, it succeeds largely because it's written in such a fun and quick style.  Paul Magrs' prose style is incredibly engaging; it's Terrance Dicks with a real sense of poetry.  While some books get humor all wrong by dwelling too much on the outrageousness of the situational comedy, MAD DOG quickly moves from one insane setup to another.  There are some wonderfully described passages that will have you chuckling to yourself for weeks.  It's fluffy, but it's not insultingly so.  It's vaguely clever enough that I certainly didn't feel that I had wasted my time on something inconsequential.  It's amazingly entertaining, and while I wouldn't want to read an entire series of books like this, as a one-off it succeeds magnificently.<br />MAD DOGS works as a great standalone romp through the weird and wacky world of Who.  If you're someone who doesn't like your Who to be horribly serious at all times, then in all likelihood you'll adore this one.  But then, you probably realized the lack of inherent seriousness present in the text when you threw your hands over your face to protect yourself from the intense radioactive blast of a cover.	2002-04-08
US	50631983	R1OQ2ZZPMRDBVY	0426203844	379676441	New Adventures of Doctor Who: Transit (New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A bit of a muddled mess	TRANSIT has divided fandom since its publication.  At the time, a lot of fuss was made because of the supposed adult elements and mature themes.  Some fans decried what was to become the wave of the future by screaming that Doctor Who had never been like this before.  Still others reveled in it, saying fairly similar things as the detractors had, but loving it for those very same reasons.<br />With the benefit of hindsight, it's not easy to see what all the excitement was about.  The books have moved far beyond what was achieved in TRANSIT, and the so-called shocking elements seem neither outrageous to this jaded reviewer nor do they seem unjustly gratuitous.  The supposed over-the-top adultness slips into the story so effortlessly, that is easy to forget that these mature elements are often accused of being unnatural to the way in which Doctor Who works.  Only the swearing and the slang still stand out as being different and extreme.  But for all the talk about what effect the novel had or didn't have on the books that followed, TRANSIT still must stand or fall based on its own merits.<br />The future culture that Ben Aaronovitch creates is fairly detailed and quite fascinating.  There are bucketfuls of great little references to life in the future.  From the Kwik-Kurry fast food restaurants to the Transit system itself, everything one learns about this society leaves one wanting to learn more.  This story contains simply some of the best settings that we've ever seen in a Doctor Who story.  It's realistic and gritty but completely enthralling.<br />The story itself is fairly interesting, and there's quite a lot of detail that one needs to keep track of.  It's by no means a simple tale, and I found myself needing to go back to previous chapters and reread certain pages after finding revelations further ahead in the story.  This is not an easy book and it requires the reader to pay a lot of attention.<br />Yet despite all the obvious positive points that the book has in its favor, I couldn't honestly say that I thought it was a very good book.  There's a lot of overt machismo present that really doesn't do anything for me.  There are fairly large chunks that are neither enjoyable, nor do they add anything to the plot.  There's red herring chase sequences, long action scenes, gunfights, air battles and all manner of military hardware.  It would look fantastic on television, if the budget was twenty times what Doctor Who got per season.  In short, there are vast portions of the book that are just plain boring to read.<br />The plot is a bit murky.  For the most part it makes sense and is fairly coherent, but it's never really engaging.  It's a bit too slow in places and at times it completely stops.  The bits of characterization and cultural references that surround it are really quite good, but they can't make up for the weaknesses elsewhere.   A portion of the ending, in particular, is shockingly poor and comes as a let-down after the amount of complexity that there had been in the lead up to it.<br />All in all, TRANSIT ranks as a fairly well put together story but one hampered by several major weaknesses.  While it's now notable for the much-needed shock that it put fandom through at its publication, the story itself is not quite strong enough for the book to stand on its own two feet.  There is a ironic sense of humor drifting through that will amuse even the most offended of readers, and there are loads of fabulous lines sprinkled throughout the text.  Unfortunately, the strong points aren't enough to save this book from being a bit of a mess, albeit a well intended and potentially wonderful one.  Definitely a story in need of an extra few drafts.	2002-04-04
US	50631983	R3SUU4LAZET692	1903889022	750560453	Time and Relative (Doctor Who)	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Fine and Relevant	As the first in a new line of Doctor Who books, TIME AND RELATIVE had a lot that it needed to accomplish. Not only is the first story of a series held up (perhaps unfairly) as representative of how the line will progress, but it helps to establish the tone and style of a particular publishing group. With the Doctor Who book market already stretched to almost the breaking point, this new line will have to accomplish great things in order to justify its existence to the consuming public. Fortunately, it turns out that this book is a fine example of a good Doctor Who story. It isn't the greatest Doctor Who adventure that has ever been written, but there are many little reasons that definitely make this worth the time it takes to read. <br />As a story that is told entirely from the POV of Susan's diary, one may be a bit concerned with exactly how well this will be executed.  During the course of her travels on-board the TARDIS, Susan was not always the most interesting of companions despite the unique relationship that she shared with the Doctor. When I heard that TIME AND RELATIVE was set before AN UNEARTHLY CHILD and that there would be no viewpoint outside of Susan's, I feared the worst. Susan dealing with rotten teachers. Susan dealing with catty classmates.  Susan dealing with... boys. The horror, oh, the horror. <br />To my complete shock, my favourite portions of the book were those that focused on Susan's comparatively mundane adventures at Coal Hill School. Those diary entries are excellent. Many teenagers feel like outsiders at times, but an alien from a far off place stuck in an English school in the 60's is truly a unique individual. And Kim Newman captures her perfectly. As a character study of the two explorers that we met in An Unearthly Child, this story excels. The mystery that was so prevailing and compelling about those early days is back in full force, though there is a slight added twist, which you'll have to read for yourself to discover. <br />The story actually takes a slight dip once the main plot begins and the inevitable Doctor Who monsters show up. They're quite well written and interesting, but these passages simply aren't as good as the sections that heavily feature Susan's thoughts. Her viewpoints and opinion come through occasionally, of course, but they're spread too far apart. Susan and her strange Grandfather are the real stars of this story, and we hate being distracted from them, if even for a moment. <br />The plot itself is fairly simple and occasionally borrows from other stories, but it is quite well suited to the novella format. The ending is perfect, with the actual turning point at the conclusion being a stroke of genius. There are only a few points where it feels like a run-around, which it really is at the heart of it. It's all this other wonderful stuff around the bare plot that makes it so enjoyable. <br />As the beginning to a new line of books, TIME AND RELATIVE largely succeeds. If you're curious about this series, then know that this story is a great beginning. It plays to the strengths of its novella-sized format and includes some excellent character pieces. It may not be the greatest Doctor Who adventure that you'll ever read, but it's certainly one of the better ones.	2002-04-02
US	50631983	R6HXOZ06PUES3	0201354632	513731586	JavaScript for the World Wide Web, Third Edition (Visual QuickStart Guide)	Books	3	16	17	N	Y	Not meant for advanced programmers	JAVASCRIPT FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB is a good book for teaching Javascript programming to people who have no real interest in learning how to program.  As one has probably gathering from surfing the web, there are a lot of Javascript-enabled Web pages put together by people who have absolutely no idea about how to program a script.  This book was made for people like that, who have no desire to move beyond Javascript into the world of more advance programming languages (and contains a lot of stuff that would make those badly designed Web pages work a whole lot better).  It's a slim volume (252 pages plus appendixes), so you shouldn't be expecting to find very detailed coverage of the language here.  It concentrates on the material that the majority of web-page designers are going to be using, so unless you're planning on becoming an expert in Javascript, the information provided here should be more than adequate for anything that you want to do.<BR> <BR>Keep in mind that this is a book primarily for beginners to the field.  You don't even have to know much HTML, which is both a blessing and a curse.  A blessing because it forces the book to explain most of the functionality that you will need to know, but a curse because it holds back from dealing with more advanced functions.  Hardcore, experienced programmers are not the book's intended audience, so the gaps in its information are not as harmful as they would otherwise be.  The subjects that it does cover are explained reasonably well and should be simple enough for most people to understand.  <br />Unfortunately, there are a handful of places where the book assumes the reader to have more knowledge than a beginner would likely have.  To an experienced programmer, these omissions would not be the slightest problem, but the book seems to be geared more towards novices.  Basic programming concepts like loops and conditionals are mentioned, and briefly explained, but don't provide quite enough elaboration for someone who has never had any experience with such things before.  This really only happens in a few isolated areas, but it could probably frustrate a beginner.<br />The major topics that this book covers are: images, frames, browser windows, cookies, forms, plug-ins, and dynamic Web pages.  The book covers other areas as well as providing a basic introduction to basic programming languages that may not be quite in-depth as it should be.  It runs the risk of falling between two stools; the advanced user will definitely find this inadequate, but the novice may find a few parts too complicated.  Fortunately, gaps in the fundamentals are few and far between.  Once the book gets into the heart of its Javascript coverage, the beginning programmer will find lots to learn.<br />If you just want to know about how to put Javascript bells and whistles on your Web page, then you could do a lot worse than this book.  It's far too superficial for the experienced programmer, or for the reader planning on gaining more depth; so if you fall into those categories, then you pay want to purchase something else (I'd recommend O'Reilly's JAVASCRIPT: THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE).  But for the subjects that the book does explain, it does a fairly good job.  Recommended mainly for novices, but also for intermediates who only have select uses for Web-based Javascript.	2002-03-27
US	50631983	R2IH1OPH03GH8V	0130173606	189206397	The Essential Guide to Digital Set-Top Boxes and Interactive TV	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A good introduction to a complicated subject	A lot of the information contained in THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO SET-TOP BOXES AND INTERACTIVE TV is specialized and arcane. Of course, this shouldn't be that great of a surprise, given the relatively small size of this particular field at the moment. The material covered in this book should give the newcomer to the field a lot of the valuable and fundamental information that they'll need to know. Unfortunately, some of the data is out of date, and there are several new things that have come about since the publication of this book. It's useful for someone who is just getting started, but I'd like to see a new edition written some time soon that takes the material mentioned here and goes farther with it.<br />There is quite a lot of information that's been packed into this book. In fact, at times it almost appears too compressed and some topics could have used much more elaboration. In particular, the chapter that deals primarily with the possible Internet applications only brushes the surface of what could be discussed. The topics that are touched on include: Digital TV (an overview), enhanced TV, set-top hardware architecture, set-top server architecture, set-top operating systems, set-top middleware, set-top platforms, set-top application development (Intranet, Internet and otherwise), electronic program guides, and set-top smart cards. As you can no doubt tell, this is a staggering amount of material to get through in only about three hundred pages. Obviously the level of detail is not going to be terribly high, but it is worth it to get an introduction to so many different topics.<br />For the programmers out there, think of this ESSENTIAL GUIDE as a breadth first search. It covers a wide range of areas, but it does so superficially. As something you read once to get a feel for the terminology and the particulars, this book is quite good. But it's not very effective as a resource or a reference, because the in-depth material one would need simply isn't present. A good introduction only.	2002-03-27
US	50631983	R12VFWYBTHBVZU	0563538422	767196252	The Adventuress of Henrietta Street (Doctor Who)	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Henrietta Street Strikes Back	THE ADVENTURESS OF HENRIETTA STREET is bloody huge.  It's a massive and epic work that is squeezed into the BBC book (less than 300 page) limit by having virtually no margins and a typeface small enough that even ants armed with stupidly powerful magnifying glasses may have trouble with fully deciphering the text.  Having recently completed reading this book, I fully expect to be squinting my way through life for the next six months and I can only hope that laser-corrective surgery will not be a necessity.  But despite the physical limitations (my eyes, my poor suffering eyes!) I found this to be quite an intriguing story and one worthy of a lot more attention than mere nitpicking over individual continuity points.<br />The book is written in the style of a pseudo-historical novel.  It's a collection of accounts, descriptions and stories of events that the narrator has pieced together from numerous, varying and (occasionally) outright conflicting historical records.  There's very little dialogue and a lot of uncertainty.  While this may seem to distance the reader from the action, it does allow Lawrence Miles to add several elements of foreshadowing and symbolism that ordinarily would have been very difficult to seamlessly add to the narrative.  It took me about thirty or forty pages to really get a feel for this style (and thirty or forty pages of this dense and, at times, difficult material is nothing to sneeze at), but once I got a handle on it, the technique really worked for me.  It made the events being discussed feel quite epic and grand.  The settings were extremely well evoked, and despite the fantastical nature of the majority of the events, a feeling of realism was brought across to the reader.  The historical \\"age\\" of the story is made much more concrete by creating the story in this manner.  The book is able to play with the concepts of ambiguity and the unreliable narrator, but it doesn't allow itself become overshadowed by them.<br />After the book has been completed, I really didn't get the feeling that I'd come to know these characters particularly well.  They certainly act in an internally consistent manner, but one doesn't quite get close enough to be able to predict their actions or to understand the subtleties of all their motivations.  This should not be terribly surprising given the style in which the book is written.  But even this shrouding of the people manages to add something to the overall work.  We're given bits and pieces of the characters.  Not enough to discover fully formed persons, but enough to tantalize the imagination.  Despite the obvious barriers between characters and audience, one wishes to learn more about these people.  Almost paradoxically, I felt as though there actually were real historical people being discussed, despite the artificial obstruction of time keeping me far away from them.  A lot of this is down to Miles' sheer writing skills that make shadowy, partially hidden figures seem somehow vivid.  Instead of appearing formless or indistinct, they came across as genuine.<br />Speaking of good writing, many passages are extremely chilling and frightening.  Indeed, this is one of the only Doctor Who books to have actually given me nightmares (okay, one nightmare), based solely on the descriptions and manifestations of the main \\"villain(s)\\" of the story.  These sections achieve a very spooky feel; the atmosphere is shockingly effective at times.  Apart from the physical descriptions, the frequent historical asides and passages excellently provide a feeling of uncertainty.  Some of the narrator's observations of the symbolism come across as heavy-handed, but for the most part they are handled well.<br />The actual content of the book is simply astonishing.  It manages to be primal and raw while also encompassing the strange, the unbelievable and the extraordinary.  Gritty descriptions of death, blood and sex are side by side with tales of the supernatural.  This is a story of Gods, elementals and forces of nature.  In the dawn before the Industrial Revolution, the armies of knowledge and intellect must battle with the strange and terrible beasts of ignorance.  It's an epic battle, and one that's absolutely spellbinding.<br />The events that take place in THE ADVENTURESS OF HENRIETTA STREET may have long lasting effects on the Doctor Who line.  Or, possibly, they may not.  Whatever the follow-up is to the proceedings of this book, the main thing to know is that this is a smart and clever story that will have you thinking about its symbolism and metaphors long after the last page has been read.  It may also have you reaching for the soothing and healing powers of friendly eye-drops so remember to keep some liquid handy.	2002-03-20
US	50631983	R2V8VKXNEECHGW	0426203852	131598285	Love and War (Doctor Who New Adventures) (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Exquisite. Absolutely exquisite.	Wow.  Reading LOVE AND WAR is a startling reminder of exactly how good Doctor Who can be.  It does so many things so well, that it becomes difficult to break down and show off the individual parts.  However, there are a number of fundamental things that Paul Cornell did particularly well, and they deserve to be given a closer look.<br />While I first read LOVE AND WAR quite a number of years ago, my recent rereading (done about seven or eight years after my initial perusal) contained a fair amount of surprise for me, solely by the amount of sequences that were very familiar despite the passage of time.  There are quite a lot of memorable scenes that had stuck in my brain, and the crystal clear familiarity with several passages meant I couldn't fully believe how long it had been since I had last read it.  Contrast this with my experiences with another early NA like TIMEWYRM: APOCALYPSE, that contained a similar time between initial and second reads, but for which the amount of material that I remembered from the first time was practically nil.<br />This is a story that can change drastically upon rereading.  If you've previously read it, then on the second reading you can see all the little touches and foreshadowing that Cornell slipped in.  For me, the first time I read it, LOVE AND WAR was the story of the Doctor's betrayal.  Yet, aided by the benefit of hindsight, it's possible to view this as an epic tragedy, with the Doctor attempting to, but eventually being unable to hold back the inevitable conclusion.  There's a lot of subtlety at work here and one almost certainly will not catch everything on the first reading.<br />The emotional content of the book is quite heavy.  There are huge doses of angst, particularly during the end, and yet the book never lets itself be overly weighted down by it.  The emotion is realistic and hard-hitting, but never gratuitous.  It could have so easily bounced straight into the realm of overbearing melodrama, but fortunately, Cornell choose not to do so.  He gave enough so that the audience could establish an emotional connection to the characters, but not so much as to cause us to be sick of them.  The balance is perfect.<br />While the plot of LOVE AND WAR is excellent, it's primarily the story of the characters that makes this such a memorable tale.  The character motivations are meticulously worked out.  It's a rare story where you can rationalize every single person's actions and still completely understand why the final conflict between the main protagonists has to occur the way that it does.  The plot drives the characters, but the characters drive the plot.  It's very neat.<br />In addition to what I've already mentioned, there are loads of slight details that make this a wonderful read.  The way the plot perfectly ties in with the characters.  The wonderfully realistic interactions between Ace and Jan, and Ace and the Doctor.  The great and understated introduction of Professor Bernice Summerfield.  The prose is on par with some seriously good books out there.  If you haven't read LOVE AND WAR, then beg, borrow or steal a copy immediately.  Sell your kids to the BBC.  Eat a whole pound of butter.  Do whatever it takes to get your hands on a copy of this book.	2002-03-13

The book is a bit cliched and predictable in places, but such a solid adventure that it's quite easy to excuse its flaws and simply appreciate it for the enjoyable escapade that it is. The characters are very well drawn and the setting fits perfectly with the story that's being told. If you're in the right mood for this sort of thing, then you'll find it to be a complete delight.<br />There are quite a number of Doctor Who cliches present throughout the story. Thankfully, Mark Gatiss has the good sense to set up many of them slightly differently than we're used to, so that the majority are not particularly annoying. Still there are moments of predictability and a few sections suffer because of their lack of originality. The ending in particular is a bit of a disappointment, as it feels jerky and uneven after the smooth and slow build-up. On the other hand, the beginning and middle sections feel deceptively comfortable and safe, which would most likely be a deliberate ploy, given the theme running through the story that highlights the dangers of nostalgia. Those who dwell too much on the past will be doomed to have no future (by having their souls eaten by loud, slobbering nostalgia-monsters, one presumes). Although the theme is hit a bit too loudly at a few points, for the most part it makes a nice backdrop.<br />The town and the characters that inhabit it are fairly stereotypical of the average sleepy English village, but for what the story was attempting, they work perfectly. Despite the relatively large number of people mentioned, most of them are given enough brushstrokes to seem realistic. The back-stories provided are quite effective and excellent at showing how the past continues to live on in the present. There are several nice touches that subtly demonstrate the link between then and now that thankfully manage to stop well short of beating us over the head with the imagery. The retirement home, the graveyard, the old semi-abandoned church, and the monastery are all quite successful at establishing this. And, of course, the most blatant reminder of one's past comes in the form of the TV serial, Nightshade, and the actor who portrayed the title character.<br />Fortunately, Mark Gatiss chose to use Quatermass as the basis for his television nostalgia-fest rather than the Doctor Who television show itself, thus sparing us from a lot of silly fandom in-jokes (the Professor X gags would come from elsewhere and become less funny with each passing reference). The sections featuring Edward Trevithick, the actor who had played Professor Nightshade, are far and away the best parts of the book. Gatiss obviously had a great affection for this character. He gets the most interesting background, his part of the story is the most exciting, and he certainly is the character with the most depth.<br />NIGHTSHADE isn't the best Doctor Who story out there, but it certainly one of the more enjoyable ones. For a fairly standard story it packs a surprising amount of subtlety. The nostalgia theme is done well and is not overused. It's certainly an entertaining tale that manages to rise above the comfortable runaround status that it could so easily have fallen into. Rereading this book in 2002 means that it seems much more light than it did ten years ago (or even eight years ago when I read it the first time) given all that has happened in the Doctor Who novels since NIGHTSHADE's publication, but it still manages to pass the test of time.	2002-03-05
US	50631983	REC1LIIJL6EZ0	0563538414	916680421	Grimm Reality (Doctor Who)	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Grim Banality	GRIMM REALITY starts off incredibly well.  So well, in fact, that I'd rate the prologue of this book as one of the best that the range has produced.  It's sharp, it's slightly surreal, and it does a wonderful job at conveying the mood and feeling of the rest of the book.  Unfortunately, the remainder of the story fails to live up to this fantastic opening, as the plot starts off dragging and then explodes into incoherence, and the characters consistently fail to impress.<br />The plot starts off slowly, and for the first two hundred pages or so, it never seems to get out of first gear.  It feels like a one-trick pony, where we are repeatedly shown the regulars put into different generic fairy tale stories.  This generates a lot of amusement and hilarity at first, but it quickly becomes stale when the characters act like fools and simply repeat the fairy tale conventions rather than subverting them or doing anything interesting with them.  Rather than becoming a part of the fairy-tale and bringing their own personalities into the old stories, it felt as though the regulars were shoehorned into the tales and weren't given the chance to act as their own person.<br />After that page two hundred mark, the story takes a turn for the worse.  Given the excuse, suddenly random events start to occur that are given little justification and little reason.  It feels as though it is being strange just for the sake of being strange and not for any other motivation.  It's a shame that the ending of the book took this form, as there should have been some interesting ways to deal with the events of the beginning and middle.<br />Very few of the characters seem to be fully fleshed out and they all feel more like caricatures than characters.  This made perfect sense as far as the fairy tale characters are concerned; after all, one doesn't expect stunning realism when dealing with wicked stepmothers and archetypal princes.  But unfortunately this sloppiness extended into the entire cast, including the outsiders to the fairy-tale world and even to the regulars themselves.  The exchanges (and the inner thoughts that were interspersed throughout those sequences) between Anji and the female starship commander were so clichéd and banal, that I had to wonder if there was some joke that I was missing.<br />With all that said, it's a shame that the book doesn't hold together so well, because there are several individual standout moments that border on excellence.  The prologue is delicious, and does a great job of setting the stage for the book as well as being a superb piece of writing in its own right.  This is one of the best openings to a Doctor Who book that I've read in a long time, and probably rests as one of my favourite ever openings in the series.  Several of the jokes sprinkled throughout are rather quite funny, and when the book does try to amuse, it usually succeeds.  Also of note is Anji's Cinderella subplot, which for the most part is quite enjoyable, although it becomes less endearing the longer it progresses.  I also enjoyed many of the passages that were written in the same form as the old fairy-tales.  It's a pity that the whole book couldn't have been written in this manner, as the prose really sparkled.<br />To sum up, I found GRIMM REALITY to be a disappointment.  It had a great premise and failed to capitalize on it.  By the time one gets to the end, one notices that there have been too many threads that were never tied together.  The whole enterprise just feels like a letdown to what should have been a great story.  The different portions just never seem to completely mesh together, and it feels rather disjointed.  A few minor problems with the narrative at the beginning don't help.  Sadly, not one of the more enjoyable EDAs.	2002-02-25
US	50631983	RPCY45JY4V2MO	0563538392	302118637	The City of the Dead (Doctor Who)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Great things from a new author	I'm always happy when a new writer enters the Doctor Who range.  New voices tend to bring a breath of fresh air and a new perspective to the characters and stories that we know so well.  Lloyd Rose's debut is particularly impressive, invoking memories of several other fantastic first-time novelists who went on to consistently be the stars of the line.  It's not a flawless work, as it suffers from a few minor problems that can easily put down to first-time jitters.  But it's enthusiastic enough and so professionally written than one can forgive it its slight imperfections and enjoy it for the wonderful piece of writing that it is.<br />Although, on the cover, the words \\"Doctor Who\\" dwarf the title of the book, it is the city in question that nearly swamps out the Doctor.  The New Orleans of this story is vividly portrayed and nicely detailed without feeling belabored.  Rose provides us with just enough to inspire the imagination, yet one never feels as though she is merely showing off her knowledge of the city.  It's a difficult and narrow line to walk, but in CITY OF THE DEAD it looks positively easy.  This is not a case of an author setting a story in whatever city she happened to randomly hit on a dartboard; New Orleans is integral to this story.  The city of aboveground tombs, magic shops and cult followers adds flavor and atmosphere while grounding the story firmly in the \\"real\\" world.  Despite the unworldly events of the later part of the book, the story never loses sight of its essential realistic quality.  Given the fairly liberal use of magic throughout, this is quite an accomplishment.<br />At times this feels like a thriller, with a lurking and desperate murderer who practices magic and hides in the shadows.  Because of this, a handful of characters don't get as much development as they could have done.  Rose shows that given time, she can create some memorable and excellent characters, but several of them just aren't given all that much space.  This is understandable, since the whodunit aspect of the story relies on there being a large enough group of suspects.  Despite the inherent problems with writing for such a great number of characters in a relatively small amount of space, this isn't a particular problem here.  One just wishes that all of the characters had been given as much to work with.<br />Although there are a few minor problems with the resolution to the mystery, the effect is quite masterful for the lead up to the unmasking.  The unveiling of the magician mastermind came as a genuine shock, and probably should have been foreshadowed a little better up to that point.  Even so, the investigation is quite intriguing.  If you're not careful, you'll find yourself staying up far later at night reading just to see what happens next.<br />The prose in this book simply sparkles.  There are several memorable passages that will be staying with you long after the book has been placed back on the shelf.  Several dream sequences suck the reader in, without falling into over-the-top melodrama as happens all too often when dealing with unreal or hallucinogenic writing.  A lot of mention has been made about the strong use of magic with only one or two explanations in the narrative of how it relates to scientific rationality.  Almost everything that has been said on the matter is correct, yet the magical forces don't feel at all out of place for a Doctor Who novel.  The use of magic is added so seamlessly that by the end of the book one suddenly has the impression that surely there must have been several other such stories in the past.  It's executed so effortlessly, that one almost doesn't feel the need to give it undue notice.  It isn't a book \\"about\\" magic any more than THE TURING TEST was a book \\"about\\" science.  Magic and science are merely the tools used to tell the story.  They add a certain flavor and texture to the story, but there is certainly quite a lot more going on here than just a ghost story with a few magicians in it.<br />CITY OF THE DEAD isn't a perfect novel, of course.  There are a few sections (mostly in the first half) where characters move around to satisfy the plot at the expensive of any motivations they may have had themselves.  The ending, in particular, is slightly vague and confusing.  Yet it is still written strongly enough that many of these problems aren't quite as serious as they would ordinarily be.  One gets quite caught up in the action, so much so that any imperfections rarely impeded my enjoyment of the book itself.<br />Despite the relatively minor flaws that I mentioned, CITY OF THE DEAD is quite a good book.  It stands as one of the better Eighth Doctor Adventures and takes its place among the best Doctor Who novels written by a first-timer.  I find myself greatly looking forward to Lloyd Rose's next, more experienced work.	2002-02-13
US	50631983	R3GIPWGIYHJKAY	0426203682	699173970	Cats Cradle: Witch Mark (Doctor Who: New Adventures)	Books	2	3	3	N	N	"Only a Pennsylvanian would do that."	CAT'S CRADLE: WITCH MARK takes place both in the mythical land of Tir na n-Og, and in a simple Welsh village.  We know that the land is mythical because we see a lot of unicorns and centaurs.  We know that the small village is in Wales, because characters actually refer to each other as \\"Boyo\\".  The story starts off intriguingly enough.  A bus crashes, and during the police investigation, it is discovered that none of the dead bodies can be identified.  It's an interesting twist on the standard missing persons story, but unfortunately, the narrative isn't able to sustain its interesting beginnings.<BR> <BR>The plot turns out to be slightly poorer than it really should be.  To make a long story short, this is the tale of a quest across a strange and magical land, filled with centaurs, unicorns, trolls and other unworldly creatures.  Unfortunately, that's all the story is.  The Doctor and Ace begin their trek fairly early in the book, but by the three-quarters mark, they are still pretty much in the same state that they were in the beginning, the plot not having budged an inch.  Don't get me wrong now, I don't mind a story that's padded, as long as the padding consists of interesting material, sparking prose and enough entertaining substance to maintain the reader's attention.  This is not what we got here.  And on top of that, after one has struggled through pages and pages that don't amount to anything, the resolution is shockingly quick and far too simple.  I do not have a problem with the Doctor talking his way through a solution; in fact, I think some of the best stories have been enhanced by featuring a clever and witty Doctor who is able to mentally run rings around his opponent.  Unfortunately, the level of argument has to be of a higher quality than what we ended up with here.  Having the Doctor more or less saying, \\"Don't do this evil thing\\" and giving the villain no greater of a response than, \\"Gee, okay\\" does not make for an exciting resolution.<br />Evenmore appalling than the lackluster outcome to the villain's evil scheme is the fact that there are numerous plot threads that are just left dangling.  Character motivations that one expected to be explained by the end of the book simply aren't addressed.  There are many sequences that only work if you don't think about them too much and forget them before you reach the ending.  If one happens to go back and start picking things apart, one will find a host of actions and scenes that were simply left unresolved.  It really leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.<br />WITCH MARK features two of the worst portrayed Americans that the series has ever seen.  In their introduction, the author is so intent on making sure they're recognizably American, that he moves them way beyond Cliché American and Stereotypical American and blasts them somewhere into the realm of Ludicrously American and Overwhelmingly Fake American.  Make no mistake, if this was a televised story, then they'd both end up sounding exactly like the oh-so-American guy in TOMB OF THE CYBERMEN who went around spouting off macho nonsensical dialog such as, \\"Hey, some character's gone an' bahlled up tha loh-t!\\", \\"C'mon, let's get back to tha rah-ket!\\", and \\"Hey, Vic!\\"  Not exactly the soft, realistic character study that one should be aiming for.<br />The other characters aren't much better.  The Doctor and Ace aren't acting like their usual selves.  The Seventh Doctor seems at times to be behaving like any incarnation other than the current one.  Ace is back to being a silly teenager who appears to have completely bypassed the events of REVELATION and WARHEAD.  Secondary characters are similarly poor, with special mention going to the idiot, lisping priest.  Future authors should take note: speech impediments aren't really all that funny, and there's nothing more annoying than reading dialog that incorporates a heavy lisp.  I was begging for the character to give a quick wink to the audience, shout \\"Thufferin' thuccotath!\\", and then take a flying leap towards the nearest window.<br />The book does have a few things working for it.  The mixture of science fiction and fantasy is actually quite interesting.  There was the potential here for everything to be rationalized away in an extremely boring \\"here's the way magic and science really work\\" speech, yet it rose above these would-be pitfalls.  The relationship between Tir na n-Og and \\"real\\" Earth somehow managed to come across without feeling cheap.  The story was straightforward enough and could be fairly enjoyable in a leave-your-brain-at-the-door type of way.  It just isn't at all satisfying.<br />In the end, sloppy writing and elemental mistakes really hurt this book.  What should have been a mind-blowing ending to the Cat's Cradle series turns out to be a fairly standard run-around in fantasy-land.  The story itself is hurt by a lack of coherence and a dearth of uninteresting characters.  Definitely not one of the better written NAs.	2002-02-08
US	50631983	R3NBNUC7VJISOT	0426203674	50138421	Cat's Cradle: Warhead (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Grim reality	The future is a grim place in CAT'S CRADLE: WARHEAD.  Breathing is difficult without the use of special masks.  Police silently patrol the night streets in their hovercars.  Shady corporations comb the local parks and sidewalks looking for unclaimed bodies (some still living) to perform dastardly experiments upon. Only one man and his contractually obligated silver cat can save the human race from itself.<br />We hadn't really seen a desolate future portrayed in quite this realistic fashion before in Doctor Who.  Apart from the constant bleak sense of a world gone sour, we also see elements of cyberpunk cropping up here and there.  While this aspect isn't as overplayed as one might fear, it does cast a fairly long shadow over the tone and feel of the book.  The writing is particularly powerful in places and some of the scenes are surprisingly chilling.  There are loads of little asides and passages that make the book spellbinding.  It's an extremely well written tale.<br />The first part of the book deals with the pieces of the puzzle.  At first it's not altogether clear how these different sections interrelate to each other.  It's quite fun to work out what's going on.  A name crops up from an earlier section, a scene links from something that was referenced to earlier.  When you finally do figure out what's happening, it's quite rewarding.  Personally, I loved putting all of those pieces together.  Many times during reading I was finding myself flipping backwards and forwards impressed by the ease in which Andrew Cartmel made everything fit together just so. The Doctor's presence hovers over the many passages that he is absent for.  Even during the fairly long stretches where he isn't to be seen, his fingerprints are visible.  The plot is careful and calculated, with a lot of attention to detail.<br />Fortunately, the second part of the book also maintains a high quality of the first.  Naturally, the Doctor's plan doesn't seem to unravel quite as expected, so rather than the plot falling into a predictable format, there is still an element of surprise to be had.  The future that we had glimpsed in the earlier portions is fleshed out more here.  Parts of the story here are trippy and mess with your head in the best possible way.<br />One of the few things I didn't like about the story was the seemingly shallow portrayal of the main villain.  We don't really learn too much about him, about his plans, or about his motivations.  But most importantly, we don't really find out why it is that the Doctor is so hell-bent on making sure that his schemes are defeated; we just have to take it on faith.  Sure, putting people's souls inside machines to avoid the responsibility of having to clean up the environment does seem to be a bit shortsighted, but it doesn't quite carry the assumed weight that one would expect.  It feels a bit of a let down after seeing the Doctor's intricate plan.<br />Overall, this is one of the better Doctor Who books.  The prose is captivating, the story is unpredictable, yet seamlessly logical, and the Doctor has never been more powerful.  WARHEAD demands multiple rereads.	2002-02-02
US	50631983	R3MWLSVGRE0WIG	0743407288	276998831	Alfred Hitchcock in the Vertigo Murders (Alfred Hitchcock Mystery)	Books	2	1	2	N	N	I feel dizzy	There were times while reading THE VERTIGO MURDERS that I got the distinct impression that the author was not expecting to get the required permission to insert Alfred Hitchcock into his story.  Certainly the Master of Suspense has a very limited role in the book; he appears at the beginning and again at the end, while having only a handful of cameos during the bulk of the tale.  During his brief appearances, he doesn't seem to be a terribly distinct character.  Apart from dropping a lot of trivia about the films that he is busy with, one really doesn't feel as though we're dealing with the genuine article.  Without Hitchcock, the book has very little to offer as compensation.  It's entertaining for much of the duration, yet never memorably so, and there are several elements that pull this story down.<br />The book is heavily based upon the dime novels of the time in which it is set (the 1940s in Hollywood, California).  Yet, interrupting this pastiche of the pulp genre are numerous raw (or perhaps \\"more modern\\" would be a better way to describe them) elements.  Characters refer to female body parts in an explicit manner, discuss back alley abortions, and are occasionally more graphic than one would have expected had this actually been written during that era (this was published in 2000).  Had these more realistic elements been seamlessly inserted into the narrative, then I think the effect could have been very interesting.  After all, the advantage of writing in this style today is one can get away with discussing certain material that wouldn't have been permitted in that era.  But in THE VERTIGO MURDERS, the attempt just isn't coherent enough to be truly effective.  The modern elements are too jarring and distracting.  One goes from cartoon violence, smack dab into intensely gritty realism, and then right back into the relatively innocuous world of pulp sleaze.  It wasn't a bad idea, but the execution just didn't work for me.<br />The resolution of the story's bigmystery comes as a disappointment.  The ending makes logical sense, but it arrives completely out of nowhere.  Really excellent mysteries often times will have the answer staring the reader right in the face.  Clues work best when they're obvious enough for the audience to remember, but subtle enough not to give the game away before the final scene.  Unfortunately in this book, the clues are buried in such a way that when the solution is revealed, one will be taking the book apart trying to discover the clues locked away in an obscure paragraph.  While there are a few cheats where the author has kept some information hidden until the end, most of the facts are present; the solution just isn't all that satisfying.<br />All in all, this was a bit of a disappointment.  There were certainly some fun parts of the book, and the journey that the investigator took was fairly interesting at times.  But the plot was stretched far too thin for the amount of pages that it took up.  While the book boasted some huge margins and large spaces between lines (it almost looks like double spacing), it could have done with a handful of major edits to get rid of some of the excess material.  On the other hand, I did like the team of Hollywood director and ex-cop that was set up at the end.  I wouldn't mind reading further mysteries and adventures of this pairing (the ending certainly sets up the possibility of there being more to come from these two), I would just hope that the plot and story that they find themselves in would be better thought out.	2002-02-01
US	50631983	R2LKY2AEXKJY1Z	0380729407	944543338	Something Wicked This Way Comes	Books	4	108	120	N	N	A novel that will stay with you	If there's one thing that Ray Bradbury excels at, it's his ability to recapture the range of emotions and attitudes that were present in all of us when we were just young, impressionable children.  It's a sign of a talented writer if he or she is able to make the reader feel nostalgic for a childhood that one didn't have.   SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES pushes all the right buttons in reminding us of the wonder that was present in everyone.<br />A lot has been said about the prose of this book, and it's certainly of a higher quality than one would be expecting from a \\"horror\\" story.  It's quite poetic and most of the time it is excellent at painting the scene.  However, there are a number of places where it feels forced and pretentious, as if Bradbury is writing that way just to show off his thesaurus-reading skills.  But for every turn of phrase that falls flat, there exist several chilling moments that will be forever etched in the mind of the reader.  It's a step above the sort of material that one usually finds in genre works.<br />The point of view from the two children is executed amazingly well.  As in his other novels and short stories, Bradbury demonstrates his superb ability to realistically portray the beliefs and emotions of children.  They aren't overly mature, but neither are they childish.  He's hit the nail so perfectly that it really feels as though one is reading a true-life account of some curious boys, rather than a fictional account.  On the other hand, breaking up the action between two children means that we never really get extremely close to either one.  There's some nice interaction between one of the boys and his father that deals with the grown-up's attempt to develop a backbone and to stand up to the evil carnival people.  This relationship creates some great dialog between the child and parent, as the older man tries to explain thoughts and concepts that are just slightly outside what the child can realistically understand.<br />The story itself is quite chilling and is told well.  Many of the actions that occur don't really make much logical sense, but they are nonsensical in the same way that fairy tales don't make sense; everything works inside the current context and that's just fine for their purposes.  Evil men do evil deeds simply because they're evil.  Good men attempt to prevent the spread of evil, because that's what good men do.  Their motivation really isn't important.  What makes it work is the journey that the characters go through.  <br />SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES is certainly a recommended work.  Although often classified as a horror book, it really isn't all that frightening.  But it succeeds at being a fantastic adventure tale that will remain with the reader long after the final page is turned.	2002-01-27
US	50631983	R2L57PW5KVKRJR	0563538376	97913027	Dark Progeny (Doctor Who)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Great characters wandering around a hum-drum plot	DARK PROGENY could have turned out to be much worse than it actually ending up being.  Despite it being quite well written, it has one major factor working against it; the plot is wafer thin, and stretched to its breaking point.  This severely upsets the pacing, leaving a rushed conclusion where the threads from the first two hundred pages or so are slapped together inside about thirty.  DARK PROGENY ends up being as enjoyable as it is solely on Steve Emmerson's strength in writing realistic characters.<br />There is a larger cast of characters in this story than we're probably used to seeing in the average Doctor Who story.  In other books, this would have resulted in several people becoming faceless plot ciphers with little to do but run around and discover clues at exactly the right moment.  Here, however, every character is extremely well created.  One can tell that a lot of time and effort went into producing characters that are believable and interesting.  Their lives, motives and thought processes are all realistic and engaging.  We keep reading because we want to see how the plot affects these people, not necessarily because we want to see how the plot unfolds.  Despite the flaws in storytelling, the characters make the book marginally recommendable.<br />The society that the Doctor and crew have landed in is also portrayed very well.  The larger cast helps Emmerson show off the different parts of the world without any individual location left underdeveloped.  The action feels like it's taking place in a city rather than a collection of sets.  Emmerson is a deceptively good author.  In only a few pages he manages to convey a coherent culture of the future.  In a handful of cases, we can see where he fell back on pre-existing continuity, yet everything ends up feeling fresh.  A few minor Doctor Who clichés are revisited, but they're given new life and don't drag the story down at all.<br />With a great setting and an interesting group of people, one would expect the regulars to benefit from their current environment.  Alas, this is not the case.  Unfortunately neither one of the companions is terribly active for much of this adventure.  Anji ends up being a key player at the beginning and at the end, but for much of the middle she has very little to do other than passing out and requiring medical attention.  Her passages have the advantage of being well written enough that I was almost distracted from the fact that she spent most of the book doing absolutely nothing at all.  Yet it still felt rather unsatisfying.<br />Fitz also spends a lot of time in various states of health, but he is even farther away from the action.  Thematically, it makes sense for the Doctor to believe that Fitz has died; many of the characters are forced to deal with the pain of loss followed by the shock of reunion (or at least the tantalizing hope that their loved one may not be gone forever).  But in this case the thread is a complete dead end.  It doesn't affect the plot, it doesn't really tell us anything about the setting that we didn't already know, and it doesn't give us any new insight to any other of the characters.  Fitz's sections end up dragging flatter and flatter as one realizes that whatever happens to him isn't going to make a blind bit of difference to anything else.  This sort of thing has happened to Fitz before in previous books, but here his subplot just isn't interesting enough.<br />Overall, this book ended up being quite average.  Steve Emmerson is quite good at writing of actual prose, and he creates great characters that stand beside the best that the range has invented.  The Eighth Doctor has rarely been better than the portrayal that he receives here.  But the weakness in this story was the lack of a coherent and sustained plot.  The pacing was way off and the manner in which the ending wrapped itself up so quickly really draws attention the flaws.  However, despite the problems with this one, it's just about worthreading to see the setting and the characters that Emmerson created.  I'll be looking forward to his next book and hopefully it will be better plotted.	2002-01-23
US	50631983	RLDFV72LBYTSC	0879100362	979736969	Harpo Speaks!	Books	4	52	53	N	Y	Honk!  Honk!	Autobiographies are usually enjoyable for one of two reasons.  The author can possess an engaging style that piques the reader's interest regardless of the material.  On the other hand, the author may have lead such an interesting life that the subject matter is fascinating despite their ability to spin a good yarn.  Fortunately, in the case of HARPO SPEAKS! both conditions are satisfied, creating a well-written, intriguing look at one of the more interesting characters of the first half of the Twentieth Century.<br />Harpo Marx was famous for being the silent clown who never uttered a word during any of the dozen or so Marx Brothers movies.  However, his story is quite a fascinating one.  I'll admit to being slightly surprised at exactly how engaging the prose style of this book was.  Having no idea what he sounded like, even in scripted movie conversation, I was curious as to how he'd come across in print.  Fortunately, either he or his co-author, journalist Rowland Barber, was quite good at the art of storytelling.  The reader really feels close to the action, as though one were really there.  It's a simple and straightforward style, but it's one that is quite effective.<br />As I mentioned, the events of Harpo's life were extraordinary in themselves.  Quite literally a rags-to-riches story about a group of vaudeville brothers who made it very big, this book is excellent at reconstructing those early days when they rarely had enough to eat, but always had a laugh and a game of cards to pass the time.  The autobiography goes into great detail about his early childhood, from being literally thrown out of school (from a first floor window) and never returning, to every lousy part-time job that he had.  The book spends quite a lot of time detailing the various schemes that Harpo and Chico (at that age, they were often mistaken for twins) had to try to make the largest amount of money possible while doing the smallest amount of work.  Each method is equally hilarious,as are the attempts by Harpo to spend, or hide the resulting cash before Chico had a chance to &quot;re-invest&quot; it.<br />Much of the chronicle of his adolescence and early adult life centers on traveling on the road with his brothers and getting booked into a variety of theatres and clubs.  Being on the road meant very little time to oneself, so we get a real sense of the relationship that existed between the members of the Marx family.  Although this portion of the book is the most heavily involved in his stage performance, a great deal of time is still spent talking about different ways the Marx Brothers found themselves relaxing between shows.  That means that there are a lot of anecdotes about card games, but don't worry -- the stories are wonderful.<br />The sections dealing with his adult life revolve more around his friends than on the work he was doing with his brothers on the silver screen.  Fortunately, Harpo was mixing with some fascinating people, and you hardly miss the lack of discussion about his movie career.  His descriptions of the time he spent during the '20s make for fascinating reading.  Who would have guessed that Harpo Marx, the clown who ran around in a slashed raincoat, was mixing with intellectual heavyweights such as George Bernard Shaw and Alexander Woolcott?  Even after the market crash and the end of that decedent decade, there are numerous amusing anecdotes, my favourite being the occasion that Harpo ended up being a spy for the U.S. Government, smuggling secret documents out of the Soviet Union.  <br />The majority of the final few chapters deal with his wife and children.  It's quite obvious that he cared deeply for his family, and one gets the impression that talking about them in this way is his equivalent of showing us his cherished family photographs.  While this has the tendency to be slightly tedious in places, Harpo's enthusiasm is contagious.  It's fascinating to see him learning lessons from his own childhood and fromhis children.<br />HARPO SPEAKS! is quite a recommended read for anyone, whether they're a Marx Brothers fan or not.  Harpo's adventures make for wildly entertaining reading.  Even during his later years of declining health and diminishing energy, Harpo never stops seeming like a kid who never grew up, yet one who was never childish or petty.	2002-01-11
US	50631983	R3T3DF9EHIPTCT	0426203658	254771393	Cat's Cradle: Time's Crucible (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Complexity that never fully pays off	Marc Platt's previous entry into the Doctor Who canon was 1989's GHOST LIGHT, a story so squashed into the available time allotted, that much of it seemed confusing upon the first watch.  Subsequent viewings made the material easier to understand, revealing a story in which virtually none of the action is wasted.  In &quot;Ghost Light&quot; there's hardly a single line of the story that isn't vital.<br />The difference between that story and CAT'S CRADLE: TIME'S CRUCIBLE couldn't be any greater.  Because of the strict time limits imposed on the television episodes, GHOST LIGHT ended up being boiled down to its barest essential elements.  On the other hand, freed from those constraints, TIME'S CRUCIBLE grows into a massive sprawling work that spans literally millions of years, through the history of the Time Lords, from the beginnings of Gallifreyian time travel to the journeys and origins of the Doctor.  The book suffers from an incredible lack of focus, and this is a pity because there are a lot of very interesting ideas present, that if executed properly would have resulted in a much more satisfying story.<br />The plot is intensely complicated.  Unfortunately, the complexity doesn't necessarily mean good, and the payoff at the end isn't especially rewarding.  If you have the guts to make it all the way to the ending, you'll find that the conclusion and explanations are worth it, but only barely.  It all makes sense (apart from one or two minor problems that I noticed) but when one reaches the ending, one wonders why we had to go through such an elaborate process to get to it.  It feels complicated, not because the story had to be, but because the author just felt like making it convoluted simply for the sheer sake of it.<br />The story somewhat centers around several survivors from a wrecked experimental time vessel that had crashed into the TARDIS.  The poor characterization, and unsure prose style meant that I had a lot of trouble keeping track of which person was which.  After a few pages they all seemed to melt into the same puzzlingly enigmatic character.  This was quite annoying as there was a great opportunity here to explore the characters as they appeared and reappeared in different stages of their lives.<br />It's frustrating when one sees good ideas go to waste, and TIME'S CRUCIBLE falls into that trap.

US	50631983	R18Y1KI71JTKHK	0563538317	870717948	The Year of Intelligent Tigers (Doctor Who)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Music to my ears	At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like THE YEAR OF INTELLIGENT TIGERS.  It starts off quite slowly, with a lot of leisurely scenes that are interesting and enjoyable, but don't really get the blood pumping.  It seems like it's trying to do the Doctor-and-companions-on vacation thing, but not doing it quite as well as Ben Aaronovitch had done in his fabulous THE ALSO PEOPLE.  Fortunately, the opening sections are merely setting the stage for what comes later.  The result is a book that is easily one of the best of the EDAs.<br />This is a much more in-depth and demanding novel than the previous three in the EDA range, and it's all that much more rewarding.  Once the plot kicks in, it drives the action in a relaxed, yet steady pace.  Several wonderful set pieces space out the more story-driven sequences and provide us with numerous memorable images.  The Eighth Doctor works incredibly well as a sort of mad violinist, and it's great to see him putting his passion towards something other than running around quickly.  The musical references invade every part of the book, from the structure to the dialogue to the tone.  The mentions are plentiful, but never clumsy, and are slipped in with a lot of care.<br />The society of tigers is quite well realized and there is a genuine sense of mystery and anticipation as more and more of their culture and history is slowly revealed.  I won't give away too much, but there are some great surprises contained in these sections.  Numerous Doctor Who clichés are borrowed from, but they are all given a new twist.  In some ways the basic plot resembles older stories and serials, but every time you think you know how the story will unfold, it cleverly takes a different step, defying expectation at most turns.  Such familiarity in the beginning and middle sections helps to emphasize how inventive and unexpected the ending really is.  The Doctor's solution is exactly what he has been working towards for the entirety of the book, but the execution of this plan is quite interesting. <br />The tigers (though the story points out that they merely resemble Earth tigers, and are, in fact, an alien life-form) are characterized quite interestingly, slightly better than the individual humans are.  Since we've seen hundreds of Earth colonies over the years, more time is spent building up the tiger society and so they get the lion's share of the attention.  The regulars get quite a lot to do as well.  Anji is really starting to come into her own as a companion.  Here she's organized and resourceful, yet suspicious of the actions of other people.  Without Fitz's experience, she's not quite sure where this Doctor fellow's loyalties really lie.  It isn't overdone though, and it really helps to drive the action along.  There is a great attention to detail present; every character's motivations are understandable and believable.  No one acts merely for the sake of convenience.<br />THE YEAR OF INTELLIGENT TIGERS is a great book, giving the Doctor a lot to solve, Anji a lot to angst over, and Fitz a lot to be frightened of.  As someone who isn't terribly familiar with a lot of classical music, I suspect that there were a few references that went over my head, but the musical flavour and tone of the story is maintained quite well.  Extra mention should be made of the historical flashbacks to Doctor's one hundred year exile to Earth.  These are two of the best portions of the book, and makes one wish that the Ormanblum entity had also written a book during that particular story arc.  In any case, TIGERS is one of the better EDAs and is a welcome addition to the current unfolding story.	2001-12-27
US	50631983	R2DS46LRDO16ZF	1565924878	514994297	Java in a Nutshell	Books	3	12	14	N	N	&quot;Help! I'm in a nutshell!&quot;	JAVA IN A NUTSHELL (THIRD EDITION) is one of those computer science books that I had always been told was excellent.  Professors, friends and co-workers all recommended it to me so many times that I eventually bought it soon after I began programming in Java.  Having used this book as a reference on numerous occasions, I must say that it doesn't quite live up to its hallowed reputation, although it does have a number of positive points in its favour.<br />The opening few chapters of the book are really good at setting the stage for the beginning Java programmer.  While it probably isn't simple enough for someone who is a complete newcomer to the language, it is excellent for people who already know a little bit and require more information.  The sections on Java syntax are quite thorough and understandable.  The Object Oriented Programming portions are readable and informative, without bogging the reader down with endless detail.  The background information on Java (the structure, the way methods/variables work, the flow of programs, etc) is all handled brilliantly.  Part One of this book is definitely something you'll want to treasure.<br />Part Two, the bulk of the book (Chapters 9 though 29, and covering a staggering three hundred, seventy-six out of six hundred, forty-eight pages), is devoted to what is referred to as the &quot;API Quick Reference&quot;.  It's the self-proclaimed &quot;real heart&quot; of the text.  Unfortunately, this is the portion where the book really falls flat.  What David Flanagan has done is to go through the most common Java packages/classes/APIs and cut them down to a bare listing of all their methods, exceptions, hierarchies, etc.  While this covers a broad amount of information, it does not cover it deeply at all.  I agree with his choice of most-used APIs, but he doesn't go in to nearly enough detail about them.  Almost all of the methods are given no description; they're just named.  If you are using this to look up the precise spelling/capitalization of your favourite methods, then this will do nicely.  However, if you're curious as to what each method actually does, you won't find any enlightenment here.  When one boils down the Java documentation this far, one finds that there really isn't much left at all.  Certainly nothing that's actually useful.<br />The first part of this book is first rate.  It's easy to understand, well-organized and great for beginners learning the language as well as for experienced programmers who require reference material.  The second part of the book is not so good.  For any detailed information you require, you'll find yourself forced to consult other sources (probably Sun's own API specifications which are available for free on their webpage).  Make sure you know what you're buying.  The first half of this nutshell is excellent, but you'll need something else to go with it to have a completely worthwhile reference.	2001-12-19
US	50631983	R76J4V9HNFZV0	0563538325	680798848	Eater of Wasps (Doctor Who)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Reader of Wasps	To be honest, I had not received much enjoyment from either of Trevor Baxendale's previous efforts.  COLDHEART was an overly simplistic tale that, while being faintly enjoyable, was stretched far too thin for its page count.  THE JANUS CONJUNCTION was almost painful for me to read - bad science, a horrible plot, and shallow characterizations.  Those two stories played far too safe for my liking.  While I don't expect every book to be groundbreaking in every conceivable department, I quickly become bored with those stories that seem content never to be anything more than just simple rehashes of Doctor Who serials from decades ago.  That said, however, EATER OF WASPS manages to be entertaining by taking several stock Doctor Who elements and weaving a new story around them.<br />The plot flows along fairly nicely here.  There are some interesting twists that pop up and manage to raise some genuine surprise in the reader.  But the greatest advantage that this story has over Baxendale's previous two is that he has finally managed to do the horror aspect correctly.  The previous two stories attempted to frighten by describing numerous scenes of pure disgusting material: flesh dissolving, skin falling off and mucus, mucus, mucus as far as the eye can see.  These elements were all far more gross than frightening, but the importance is that weren't really memorable; they didn't stick in the reader's mind for more than a page.  However, in EATER OF WASPS, Baxendale got it right.  Tiny bugs and insects aren't terribly frightening by themselves, but the various descriptions of wasps are legitimately unsettling and are quite good at crawling under the reader's skin (no pun intended).  While the fear factor doesn't completely manage to sustain itself throughout the entire book, the sections at the beginning and middle are excellent.  However, at some point you just become immune to the wasp eater sequences, creepy though they may be.<br />The prose is workmanlike.  There are no real fancy turns of phrase here, and there is very little that you'll be quoting to your friends (provided you're a secure enough person who would ordinarily go around quoting from Doctor Who).  This makes the book quite readable, though there are a few spots here and there where the reader may wish that Baxendale was slightly better at turning out a sentence.  Character motivations are often spelt out in painstaking detail, making the book seem far less polished than it could have been.<br />The companions, Fitz and Anji, are given almost nothing important to do here other than to carry objects around from place to place.  The secondary characters are the ones who receive most of the attention, and they do come across quite well.  While most of them don't escape from the stereotypes that we expect from a Doctor Who story set in a 1930s sleepy English village (nosy old lady; dithering, uncertain old priest; no-nonsense police officer; etc.), there are occasionally moments scattered here and there where they do come alive, if only for a brief paragraph.<br />Overall, this is an enjoyable tale.  It's not the best thing ever written in the line, but it makes for an entertaining read on a quiet weekend afternoon.  The story is solid, (for the most part) fast-moving, and straightforward without being overly simplistic.  Trevor Baxendale's novels have been steadily improving since his dubious debut.  If his next novel continues this trend, then it should definitely be a wonderful book.	2001-12-15
US	50631983	R3A0VUR5DJD79R	0563538295	652651673	Vanishing Point (Doctor Who)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Vanishing Premise	There's nothing more frustrating than seeing a book that has a lot of potential starting to lose steam.  Unfortunately, I experienced that sensation far too early in VANISHING POINT.  There's a lot of really excellent material in the book, but for everything that it does right, there's something that it does wrong.  A few changes, and this could have been one of the all-time best Doctor Who stories, but alas, much of what exists now simply doesn't quite work, ambitious though it is.<br />The premise to this book is fabulous.  A society exists where God is real and death has meaning.  Their faith isn't defined in the same way that ours is, as their religion is based upon fact and hard evidence.  This is a beautiful premise and that it ended up being mishandled was quite frustrating.  After carefully setting up this interesting scenario, Stephen Cole quickly backs away from it and confounds our attempts to view this sort of society by introducing us only to characters who begin the book full of doubts about the &quot;facts&quot; of their religion.  The beautiful background simply never materializes, as apart from a few information dumps at the beginning, it never quite makes the impact on the story that it should have.  No one that we see has really bought into the religion (though we are told that loads of other people in the population have), so it's difficult for the reader to understand the doubts that the characters already have.  People with doubts are certainly interesting to read about (and they are portrayed extremely well here), but one really gets the impression that there was an opportunity wasted here.<br />That said, the characters that we do encounter are drawn extremely well, never falling into cliché or stereotype no matter how easy it would be for them to do so.  Every action is believable and interesting.  The regulars get a lot of good stuff to do and each of the secondary characters leap from the page.  This makes up a little from the fumble thatI mentioned earlier.  The characters that we end up being presented with are drawn extraordinarily well.<br />The action flows fairly quickly and entertainingly.  There are a few nice twists and turns to keep the reader interested, but there are also some long fight/escape sequences that go on for a tad too long.  The prose is quite variable; while it mostly remains passable in some places it's quite effective and in other places it's difficult to read.  A little sharper editing could have fixed these problems quite easily.  What we have is good, but needs some further refinement.  The ending also feels a bit confused and uncertain, with a few Doctor Who stereotypes rearing their ugly heads.  If I never see a bad guy laboriously explaining his intricate plan to the Doctor before allowing him to escape, then I doubt I will miss it all that much.<br />Something else that should have been left on the cutting room flow was the strange and pointless &quot;romance&quot; that Fitz gets himself involved in.  I put the word romance in quotation marks, because it's one of those romances that leaves you unsure of just what happened.  It comes out of no where, lasts all of ten pages, and then leaves no impact on the rest of the book.  On the other hand, the other slight romance in the book is handled relatively well.  It's nicely understated and does everything right that the Fitz romance did wrong.  It's just a pity that this one, too, dissipates halfway through the book.<br />It's a shame that the book contains the flaws that it does, because this really could have been something really special.  If it had gone through another draft or two, we'd be discussing one of the great Doctor Who stories.  The addition of an another character, one without doubts (or perhaps showing the Holy Man, Nathaniel Dark, at a point while he still has complete faith), would have made a world of difference in showing off the excellent premise.  While I will always enjoy something that aims high like VANISHING POINT does, it's even more frustrating when a book like this doesn't quite pull off all the tricks that it could have.	2001-12-11
US	50631983	RI1OQE6DYC0HA	0563538279	929555240	Doctor Who - Earthworld	Books	4	4	4	N	N	It's crazy, it's loopy, it's altogether kooky	EARTHWORLD is quite an oddity.  Not only does it do strange and unpredictable things, but one can't even anticipate when it will be bizarre and when it will become sober.  The goofiness peaks earlier than one might expect, leaving the rest of the story to take a surprisingly serious turn (though it's still not all that serious).  EARTHWORLD is one of those wacky stories that defy categorization.    This is sort of a mixture of Douglas Adams, Terrance Dicks, and Isaac Asimov, with a dash of Red Dwarf and a measure of Blackadder.  That doesn't really sum it up, of course, but it does give you the basic idea of what's going on.<br />The story begins in full romp-mode.  Some of the early jokes don't work as well as they might, and right away one wonders if this is going to be a long, dull collection of jokes that are supposed to be funny, but just aren't (the only thing worse than a joke that falls completely flat is a book full of jokes that fall completely flat).  Fortunately, the book steadies itself quickly enough and becomes much more assured and enjoyable.  <br />All of the regulars shine with Anji in particular given some very good character development in her first story away from Earth.  Placing her in the middle of an action romp while she's still grieving over the events from the previous story might seem like a terrible idea, but its one that ends up being played extremely well.  I was worried at first, as all that Anji seemed to be doing was to deliberately distract herself from the issues, and I was afraid that the whole book would be spent avoiding the subject.  To my surprise and great enjoyment, the matter was not only brought up, but handled extremely well.  The smooth way in which this is handled is fairly indicative of the book as a whole; it starts off light and frothy, but when you aren't looking it becomes something much more subtle and strong.<br />Any way you look at it, EARTHWORLD was an enjoyable read.  It entertains, it amuses and it is verywell written for a first novel.  There are some companion issues dealt with here that have needed to be addressed for quite some time, and it's nice to see the book not dance around the problems.  The opening sections do have an overly light feel to them, and the way that a few jokes fail may give the reader a little pause to wonder if he/she really wants to finish the rest.  Fortunately, EARTHWORLD is one of the few Doctor Who books that starts mediocre and rises to the occasion.  The final seven pages are pure, understated wonderfulness.	2001-12-05

On one hand, it is certainly a very flawed work, with many more holes and problems than I'm usually comfortable reading.  On the other hand, I can't say it was an entirely unpleasant read, or even an unenjoyable one.  It's a fun romp, if you turn your brain off at the door.<br />There are a lot of major problems with this book.  The motivations of the main villains are not stated until near the end, and even then they are so ill-defined, that it's difficult to grasp what they are doing and why they are doing it.  Unfortunately, this fault extends to a lot of the other characters as well.  The book spends far far too much time telling us about people rather than showing their actions to us.  There are places where it feels as though it is still in outline form, waiting for the author to come over and flesh out these sequences.  The prose doesn't do any favours in this department either, as it's workman at best, but occasionally slumps down into incoherence.<br />The poor pacing is probably one of the main aspects holding this book back.  Every time it starts to do things well, the action will start skipping ahead randomly, utterly killing any positive momentum that it had gained.  It's not so much a case that the book takes two steps backwards for every one step forward -- rather it takes one step backwards, three steps sideways, a step and a half in a diagonal direction, and spins around on its tiptoes before being gang-tackled at about the 40-yard-line for a minimal gain (and if you like that NFL analogy, wait until you read the ones in the book).  This was really a shame, as the bad parts really started to outshine the places that had potential.  About half-way through the story I found myself mentally cheering the book on, hoping against hope that it would succeed despite itself.  I felt like a soccer mom, bravely shouting encouragement to her skinny, smaller-than-the-other-kids child to defy the odds and not let the team down.  And fortunately, despite some moments where it gets really rough, ESCAPE VELOCITY did not score an own goal.<br />On the plus side, the introduction of the new companion, Anji, is done fairly well.  It's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into what makes this character tick.  Alas, not as much thought has gone into what makes this character tick inside the context of this story.  What everyone has said about her character outline being randomly cut'n'pasted into the text here is completely, one hundred percent correct.  It would have been nice to see Anji's thoughts and reactions better integrated into the story.<br />I also liked the method in which the Doctor arranges to meet Fitz &quot;at St. Louis&quot;; this was quite clever.  The reaction to the restored TARDIS was done very well, and the characters of Anji and her boyfriend had a nice chemistry going.  The problem is, however, that for everything that I liked, there was something lurking around the next page to annoy me.  The aforementioned lack of proper motivations, the pointless inclusion of the UNIT competitors and, worst of all, the sheer silliness of the ending.  <br />ESCAPE VELOCITY was a hard book to dislike.  Although it made several major mistakes, it managed to somehow tell an entertaining story that held my interest throughout.  It goes from good points to bad in a seemingly random, unpredictable manner, but for all its flaws, it seems to have its heart in the right place.  Recommended as a fun romp, as long as you aren't looking for something to take completely seriously.	2001-11-30
US	50631983	R3HHQ73DW6XE9X	0563538104	925608229	Father Time (Doctor Who)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Doctor Who, Jr.	The Caught On Earth arc allowed us to see the Doctor in a new light.  At least, that's what I had been hoping for.  Temporarily freed from the shackles of past continuity and trapped for one century on an insignificant planet known well to his many readers, would the Doctor's adventures be much different from what had gone on before?  Although the first four books of this particular series were fairly good adventure stories, one somehow got the impression that many of these escapades could have taken place without the arc in place.  Some advantage was made of the arc's basic premise, but with the notable exception of THE TURING TEST, one suspected that somehow the books hadn't quite gone as far as they could have.  The format of many of them had remained the same as always; the Doctor arrives from nowhere, meets people, has adventures and solves problems, and then finally leaves at the end of the day.  THE TURING TEST managed to set the action over a longer amount of time, allowing the Doctor to build up some slightly-lengthier-than-we're-used-to relationships.  The next logical step would bring us to the point where he starts to build real long-term relationships, hopefully to see him care about someone in ways that we had never seem him caring before.<br />This is what makes much of FATHER TIME work so well.  Here, after being trapped on Earth for over 80 years, the Doctor finally starts to have a family of his own.  This shouldn't be a surprise really, after all, the Doctor was rarely seen as a loner; he had chosen to share his adventures and his travels with an extremely large group of people over the years.  Being stuck in one location finally gives him time to develop a real relationship.  Adopting a young girl at the very start of the 1980's, we see the two of them at three points of that decade - the beginning, the middle and the end.  We see his daughter, Miranda, growing up and becoming a woman, and the changes that puts on their relationship.  It's very well done.<br />Outside of the wonderful character stuff, the story itself is relatively straightforward.  Advanced aliens from the distant future have traveled back in time to find the child they call the Last One.  The Doctor has already found himself drawn to this child and is the only person on Earth who can save her from these killers.  What follows is a classic, fairly traditional tale of Doctor Who, but cleverly changed enough to give the events much more emotional impact than they would have otherwise had.  The scene at the end of the first part where the Doctor hugs Miranda and vows to protect her and to keep her safe feels so amazingly right, that it seems almost strange we've never seen anything quite like this before.<br />I do have a few minor quibbles though, mostly related to the fact that we don't see enough of the Doctor and his daughter interacting.  They share a fair amount of time together, but for almost the entire final third of the book, their face-to-face time is missing in action.  In the story, of course, this is done to increase the tension; this is someone that the Doctor cares a great deal about (perhaps more than he's ever cared about someone before), and we see how desperate he is to be reunited with her.  I understand why it was done, and I did enjoy the heightened anxiety.  But I think the only real solution it would have been to keep Miranda around for a few books to see how the Doctor reacts to danger when his own daughter is involved.<br />The story ends a little too easily, which isn't really a problem, but it does feel like a let down after the previously excellent sections.  The resolution just comes too neatly.  But that said, there are some beautiful set-pieces in this novel that I'm not going to spoil here. There are a lot of clever little touches running through the book too; notice how the narrative subtly changes as Miranda gets older, going from a fairy-tale story to a grown-up adventure.  The slight problems with the story are more than made up for in the details.  The Doctor has always had a family of sorts; it's nice to see a book about a real one.	2001-11-29

The Virgin New Adventures promised much upon their initial release.  Unfortunately, while the first three books had varying degrees of success at holding the readers' interest, they hadn't done much in the way of fulfilling their back cover promise.  The closest thing they'd done to being &quot;too broad and too deep for the small screen&quot;  was (apart from having a lot of night filming) to include characters who had been played by on television by actors who were now dead.<br />And then, on the fourth book, came TIMEWYRM: REVELATION.<br />Instead of cleverly sidestepping the Timewyrm Arc in the way that EXODUS and APOCALYPSE had, Paul Cornell dove right into the elements and constructed the story right around the Timewyrm and her mysterious powers.  Instead of having cameos of previous Doctors just for the sake of it, here we have the Doctor's past popping up to give us a different point of view.  These sections are excellent.  These are enduring images that capture the very essence of the Doctors that they are displaying.  Apart from a few places of awkwardness at the conclusion, this whole concept works very well -- which is a relief, since in the hands of a lesser writer one could imagine this going horribly, horribly wrong.  Thankfully, it works well here.<br />The book splits its time between doing things that don't work well if you think about them too hard and doing things that work exponentially better the more you think about them.  It's a strange combination, but one that ultimately succeeds.  Several characters are drawn quite realistically.  We really get inside the Doctor's head, of course, but we also get some excellent characterization out of Ace and a handful of the secondary characters.  The Reverend Trelaw and Saul are some of the most interesting people we've seen in Who.  Even the characters without much to do have several enjoyable exchanges, although one wonders while reading if Emily and Peter are ever going to have anything to do.<br />This is a story about growing up, about transforming oneself from one thing into another, while still retaining the core and beliefs of the person that was there before.  (Any similarities to the process that the books were going through -- trying to establish themselves after the glories of the television series -- can only be entirely circumstantial, I'm sure.)  For the most part, the book succeeds at what it's doing.  The sections where Ace grows up, both physically (due to age regression and progression) and emotionally are quite well done, being powerful and surprisingly subtle in places.  The difference in viewpoint between the child Ace and the grown woman are done quite well.  Cornell had a lot to say about growing up and everything works exactly as it should in the context given.<br />There are a few areas where the TV series background of the book is apparent.  The action is very fast and there are many quick-cut scenes.  It's an odd mixture of literary Who blended with televisual Who, but I think it's an experiment that mostly succeeds.  The book is fast, furious and surrealistic.  It's a head trip that almost completely works.<br />So, what we end up with is a book for which it is impossible to downplay its long-term influence.  REVELATION left its mark on the books from that point forward.  The books suddenly looked like they really could hit that goal of being &quot;too broad and too deep for the small screen&quot;.  The future was bright.	2001-11-26

The first part is an extremely long, bile-filled introductory essay from the pen of author Harlan Ellison.  The second part, and the meat of the text, is the actual script treatments of CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER, with two additional revised scenes at the end written after Gene Roddenberry (Star Trek's creator and executive producer) insisted that certain elements of the story be removed or changed.  The final part is a collection of afterwords written by various people to have worked with Ellison over the years, particularly those who were familiar with the conflict between himself and Gene Roddenberry - the Great Bird Of The Galaxy.<br />Harlan Ellison's introductory essay is a delightful, 72-page, no-holds-barred rant concerning the circumstances behind the Original Star Trek episode, CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER.  The essay, filled with some of the most creative insults you'll see this side of a Don Rickles' act, is easily worth the price of admission by itself.  In it, Ellison starts at the very beginning, painstakingly detailing the events behind the writing of the script, continues through the fights during the production and then screams about everything that took place after the show had ended.  Ellison includes numerous photocopies of damning documents that build a very convincing case for his side of the argument.  <br />It's laughable the number of things that Gene Roddenberry thought he could get away with saying at Star Trek conventions. My favourite is that Roddenberry would state during a speech that Harlan Ellison &quot;had my Scotty dealing drugs!&quot;  When Ellison would contact Roddenberry to complain about the inaccuracy of that statement, as Scotty wasn't even in the original outline, the producer would admit his mistake and promise never to say that again.  Yet the next time Roddenberry gave a speech or an interview, the &quot;he had my Scotty dealing drugs!&quot; line would be back.  Also worthy of note, is the supposed cost of the script that kept getting more and more expensive the more that Roddenberry would talk about it.<br />It seems odd that Ellison claims to have been mostly silent on this topic over the years since the production.  Judging by this introduction alone, it's hard to imagine him being silent on any topic at all.  Still it's an amazingly entertaining rant, and a testament to what bottling up anger for about twenty-five years will do to a writer.<br />On to the actual script.  Compared to the version that was actual transmitted as the Star Trek episode, the guts of the story are relatively the same.  Kirk and Spock go back in time to the 1930s to prevent history from becoming perverted due to a rogue time traveler.  There are a number of important elements that are different enough and change the light in which several powerful scenes are played out.  Spock is much colder here, and more like the alien creature seen in the original character outline and in the second pilot episode.  The opening is completely changed, as it isn't McCoy who goes back in time, but an officer on the Enterprise who is caught dealing psychedelic drugs (showing us a grittier, dirtier, less idealistically perfect, more realistic version of Starfleet than Gene Roddenberry wanted to portray).  The relationship between Kirk and Edith Keeler is also slightly different and the ending (I won't spoil it), while sharing certain elements from the transmitted version, is turned completely around.  Both the original ending and the alternative version are powerful, but it's interesting to see the differences in them from the standpoint of the men who created them.  Ellison's version is starkly realistic, showing a human, flawed side to Kirk's character.  Roddenberry's adaptation is much more idealistic, with characters who instinctively do &quot;the right thing&quot; no matter how difficult it should be for them.<br />However, some of the changes made make sense from the standpoint of the producer.  Star Trek was, of course, a continuing series and several of the elements introduced in the script just wouldn't work inside the confines of the universe that Gene Roddenberry had created.  As a standalone story, this original script is fantastic, but it doesn't make sense to see such gritty and flawed human beings when every other story has shown Starfleet officers to be perfect Supermen.  Ellison's vision may have been more dramatic, but I can sympathize with a production team that was attempting to construct a coherent serial storyline.  While Harlan Ellison's Star Trek may have ended up being better then what we got, it does make a certain sort of sense for many of his ideas to have been toned down when writing for Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek.  That said, however, I do think that a compromise situation (losing some of Roddenberry's idealness) could still have worked in this case.<br />The afterwords are a bit of a mixed bag.  Several of them do little more than take up space and to give Harlan Ellison a good character reference.  One or two of them make for interesting reading, as few of the Star Trek production team give their two cents as to what exactly was going on at their end of the debate.<br />The book is definitely worth getting, if only for the hilarious introductory remarks.  Ellison's argument is quite argued coherently and the evidence he includes is extremely  incriminating.  The amazingly fun and witty way in which he carefully demolished practically everything that Gene Roddenberry has said about the subject makes for quite entertaining reading.  The script itself is very enjoyable and very effective at tugging at the heartstrings without feeling manipulative or exploitative.  Fans of Star Trek should definitely check this out, if only to see how different this is from the transmitted version.  While much of the prototype shines through to the finished script, it's fascinating to see the original path taken with the conceptsthat Ellison created.	2001-11-25

While it has no claims above being an introduction to the material, it has got quite a lot of information packed into its 720 pages.  I had no background in Perl at all (though I already knew several other CS languages and scripts), but with this book I had no trouble picking it up.  I was able to learn a fair amount of knowledge in a short amount of time.  The layout of the book is quite helpful and organized; people with no background in Computer Science can start from the beginning with no trouble, while those readers who already know most of the fundamentals can skip ahead to the later chapters.<br />This book will teach you almost everything you will need to know as a beginning Perl programmer.  It starts with the basics (the ever-present &quot;Hello World&quot; example, operators, variables) and slowly moves to more in-depth topics (such as hashing, lists, strings, loops and subroutines) until finally getting to the harder stuff (file I/O, CGI scripting and references).  TEACH YOURSELF PERL IN 21 DAYS won't give you everything that you will ever need to know, but it will definitely fill in almost all of the blanks that you need to know most of the time.<br />As a book for beginners, this book should have everything you're looking for.  It also makes a fairly good reference guide once you've managed to establish yourself as a Perl programmer.  I'd advise buying a second, more advanced book, once you're ready to move onto more sophisticated topics.  But as an introduction, this book will cover practically everything you will need to know.  Recommended.	2001-11-24
US	50631983	RPL6VNJS2H074	0201183994	709150152	A Book on C: Programming in C (4th Edition)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Excellent reference guide	A BOOK ON C was the main textbook used in a freshman college course I took on the C programming language.  As an introduction to C aimed at people who are completely unfamiliar with the language and the programming concepts behind it, this book is not terribly helpful.  Some of the examples are a bit obscure, while some details are explained too quickly.  However, as a general reference guide for someone who is already familiar with some of the fundamentals of the C programming language, this book is invaluable.<br />I found this book to be quite handy for use in more advanced classes, as well as in programming projects done in a work setting.  The layout is very orderly, and it covers virtually all of the topics that the average programmer needs.  It doesn't get bogged down with numerous examples that can double the page count in other, more introductory programming books.  Instead, authors Al Kelley and Ira Pohl merely give one or two examples and leave it to the reader to pick up the meaning that they were conveying.  In just about every case, this works out to the book's advantage.  Instead of having to wade through numerous examples to uncover what it was you were looking for, you can get what you need at first glance and then get back to whatever it was you were doing.  This is the book's greatest strength as a guide; no one wants to spend a lot of time flipping back and forth between numerous references just to find one item.  The clear layout and the straightforward examples save the programmer quite a bit of time.<br />It also has a closing chapter that goes into a short introduction to C++ and Object Oriented Programming.  While this is by no means enough to teach anything more than the bare fundaments of OOP, it does serve as a nice introduction to the topic, which would be quite helpful for any programmer looking to go beyond their current level of knowledge.<br />All in all, I highly recommend this book for programmers who are already familiar with someof the fundamental C elements.  If you're looking for a reference guide to material you already know, or looking to plug some gaps in your knowledge, then this book should be quite helpful for you.<br />(FYI, this is a list of topics that the book covers: Introductory C Overview, Syntax, Data Types, Flow Control, Functions, Arrays, Pointers, Strings, Bitwise Operations, Enumeration Types, the Preprocessor, Structures/Unions, Lists and Sorting, I/O, the OS, Multiple Processes, OOP.  In addition to these, other topics are touched on and developed, such as information on the standard included library header files and comparisons between ANSI C and traditional C.  Standard and helpful algorithms for common tasks are also discussed.)	2001-11-19
US	50631983	R1F5M6U96BFJTY	0563538228	569950638	Doctor Who: Endgame	Books	2	0	0	N	N	We've seen it all before	The major problem I had with Terrance Dicks' ENDGAME can be blamed almost entirely on the fact that I had read both TIMEWYRM: EXODUS and PLAYERS within the past six months.  These two stories form the entire basis for the structure and the content of ENDGAME; at no point does the book ever feel like its giving us something that isn't just a rehash of things that have gone before.  ENDGAME is a story where the baddies in PLAYERS are responsible for the type of events in EXODUS.  It never deviates from this, and the results are quite unsatisfying.<br />The opening section of the book is rather interesting.  We see a depressed Doctor who's starting to crack up at the prospect of a never-ending exile on a planet that is not his own.  The sequences from the Doctor's point-of-view are well written and are excellent at conveying the hopelessness of a confused, amnesiac Time Lord who's almost suicidal at the prospect of being trapped in a linear existence for the rest of his unnaturally long life.  The only parts I was confused about were the frequent mentions made by other characters as to the fact that the Doctor has no past.  Although he arrived at the end of the 19th Century Earth with no money, no family and no memory of any previous life, he's been around for over fifty years now.   Fifty years is quite a long time in human-terms and certainly long enough for anyone to build up a long trail of traceable events (even if one has lead a completely boring life), yet people are acting as if he's just appeared out of nowhere last week.  It's possible that he keeps moving from place to place without any records (though it's mentioned that he's been living in the same flat for almost a decade) but if so, it was not properly addressed.<br />The beginning sections of the plot are fairly interesting.  This is an unabashed spy novel and the early portions are quite well told.  But the story begins to fall apart midway through and by the end major characters are jetting across theworld with ease for no real reason.  The ending to the story also feels majorly contrived, with one of the main characters (I'll be vague here to avoid spoilers) switching allegiances for no apparent reason.  It's quite handy that this person does so, as it allows the plot to end relatively painlessly, but in terms of the story, it makes absolutely no sense.<br />The book also feels rather lazily written in portions, with many clumsy examples of boring and primitive exposition.  The historical details could have been integrated into the story with much more ease, yet they feel clunky and lecturing.  Once we get past the lessons, the story itself becomes staggeringly unoriginal.  If you put Dicks' EXODUS and PLAYERS into a blender and then fed the results into a Markov Chain generator, you would almost certainly end up with something that has a remarkable resemblance to ENDGAME.  That's not to say that the ENDGAME is badly written (apart from the aforementioned instances of awkward prose), just something that you've probably seen before.<br />After the previous three books in the series (the first three books of the Earth Arc) had slowly increased in quality, it's a shame that ENDGAME fumbles the ball the way that it does.  While it does a surprisingly good job at furthering the arc along its course, the standalone story here isn't worth all that much if you've already read previous Terrance Dicks books.	2001-11-19
US	50631983	R1D2A7SN9BPOY0	0201543222	234829411	The Art and Science of  C: A Library Based Introduction to Computer Science	Books	2	36	47	N	N	The Library-Based approach does more harm than good	THE ART AND SCIENCE OF C was the textbook for the first-semester freshman college course on C programming at the university that I graduated from.  It was a total disaster.  The semester that followed (where we used the excellent A BOOK ON C by Al Kelley and Ira Pohl) consisted of unlearning virtually everything we had learned based on this book.  The reason was that although the book claims to teach the reader how to program in C, it actually teaches the student how to program in Eric Roberts C, which is based on non-standard libraries that are completely different than the ones used everywhere else in the world.<br />The book is based upon several libraries designed to make things easier for the student.  These libraries actually replace most of the standard C statements.  Input/output is now done through these libraries, as are file handling, string functions and a host of other basic operations.  The problem is that by replacing all these elementary processes the user is left learning nothing that is applicable to anything else outside of Eric Roberts C.  In order to use any programming language at all, the student will have to go back to the beginning and learn most of everything over again.  This will invariably lead to confusion as students struggle to determine which of the items they have learned are &quot;real&quot; C and which are the made-up items that have no usefulness.  The similarity of the traditional and Roberts libraries result in quite a few mix-ups in syntax.<br />I have criticized the book's use of pointless libraries, but there are several things that it does well.  There is a lot of good introductory material here for people who are unfamiliar with the bare basics of programming: loops (for, while, etc), conditionals, and syntax.  By using the simpler libraries, the book teaches the student the basics of programming, if nothing of the specifics.  This may well pave the way for the student to move on to learning real C, but for actually teaching the student anything that is useful, it fails and adds extra step that a novice programmer must go through before he/she can get to something that's informative and practical.<br />While in my personal library I kept almost all the Computer Science books that I used in my undergraduate days, this was not one of them, and was a book that I quickly sold back to the bookstore at the earliest opportunity.  If you don't plan on using C in anything beyond what you learn here, then this book might be fine for you.  If you want to learn C without having to relearn a lot of things later, avoid this one.	2001-11-19
US	50631983	R3EU2DW9OE7OGR	0563538066	933978564	The Turing Test (Doctor Who Series)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Very cleverly written	THE TURING TEST is one story told by three authors.  Mathematician Alan Turing begins the tale, novelist Graham Greene continues it to the best of his abilities, and  finally CATCH-22 author Joseph Heller completes the story.  Long time readers of the Doctor Who line will no doubt be quaking in fright throughout the final sections - not because of the writing or fear of a manic Yossarian, but from prior exposure to Paul Leonard's books where the endings are often short, hurried or just plain missing in action.  Fortunately, this is a book that holds together extremely well throughout its entire 242 page run.<br />This is an extremely well crafted story.  Since this is essentially one story told from three separate viewpoints, there is a certain (albeit small) amount of overlapping.  At many times in later sections, I would be eagerly flipping back to earlier portions to revisit an event that had previously been described.  Every time I did, I would be rewarded by the new insight or the different perspective (or just the wonderful bickering between the narrators).  It's constructed very well and is quite clever once you realize some of the stuff that Leonard is subtly slipping into the story.  The attention to detail is quite good and certainly very impressive.<br />As in CASUALTIES OF WAR, we get a slightly different view of the Doctor depending on which narrator is in control of the story's pen.  Each one sees the man differently based on their own prejudices and background.  This arc is being handled rather well, and the ending of this particular book is powerful in terms of the individual story being told, and also in the larger context.  I'm fairly surprised with how effective it ended up being.<br />As with the previous two books, the story doesn't end with everything totally spelled out for the reader.  But I think this works to much better effect here in THE TURING TEST than in either of those two tales.  Here, we have exactly enough framework constructed inorder to form one's own conclusions without going into too much detail.  As this is a completely character based story, the specifics are entirely irrelevant to the narrative.  The book ends exactly where it should, with the Doctor confused and ultimately alone, frustrated at the very last.   <br />All in all, this is a very impressive piece of writing.  Each of the three narrators have interesting voices that serve the story well.  While the book drags a bit during parts of the middle Greene section, the rest more than makes up for them.  Highly recommended, as this is something that the books should be doing more of.	2001-11-14
US	50631983	R12GCWBZEPDUTK	0563538058	766536581	Casualties of War (Doctor Who Series)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A simple tale told well	CASUALTIES OF WAR is a bit of a mixed bag, though ultimately its good points more than outweigh its flaws.  On the surface, it has quite a few similarities to the previous book, THE BURNING, though a closer inspection reveals some very interesting differences.  The plot is explained slightly more reasonably here.  Some of the characters fall into clichés, but the ones that Steve Emmerson really cares about are very realistically drawn.  Overall, I though that it while there were several flaws, this was quite a worthwhile book.<br />The plot is relatively slow in building, but that works well here, as Emmerson is quite good at building up the tension without going overboard.  We see more of how the events impact upon the characters rather than a lot of details about the particulars themselves, and I feel that this attitude really paid off well.  That said, however, the plot is almost paper-thin, with more effort going into characterization and tone.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course, but one wishes that as much time had been spent on plot as on the rest.<br />Unlike THE BURNING, I felt that the details of the alien supernatural threat were explained well enough.  In the previous book, the particulars were left so unexplained that by the time one got to the end of the story several elements still remained dangling.  This gave the impression (rightly or wrongly) that the author hadn't thought things through all the way and not bothered to come up with an explanation.  While there were a few minor, annoying gaps left in CASUALTIES OF WAR (and one major one at the end), I felt the explanations and the framework that we got here were much more satisfying.<br />The reworking of the Doctor seems to be a gamble that is paying off well (at least at this point in the Earth Arc).  He's moved a little bit beyond the alien, unknowable figure who showed up unannounced at a dinner party in THE BURNING, yet he is still the unapproachable, slightly aloof person who doesn't know who he is and where he came from.  Emmerson is quite good at telling different parts of the story through different narrative voices, and that really brings the Doctor to life.  Through the villain's eyes, we see the dangerous, Sherlock Holmes figure who is gathering evidence and getting closer to the truth.  Through the policeman's eyes, we see someone almost at home in tales of the supernatural, yet grounded enough to suggest practical solutions.  And through the eyes of Mary Minnett, we see a confused, passionate, and almost romantic figure.<br />CASUALTIES OF WAR does exactly what it sets out to do, and it does it rather well.  The story is well told, effective in its realistic feel, and quite entertaining.  The Doctor continues his journey of a hundred years, learning more about himself as we also learn more about him.  Despite a few portions where the action begins to drag, this is definitely a worthy read.	2001-11-13
US	50631983	R2T8LLDE6QWLIB	0563538120	942730071	The Burning (Doctor Who)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Weak story, but the Doctor is again interesting	THE BURNING is a new beginning for Doctor Who.  After a year-long continuity-heavy story arc that ended up collapsing under its own weight, new editor Justin Richards has entered into the picture carrying a broom large enough to sweep away all traces of Faction Paradox, Gallifrey future wars, and companions that turn into TARDISes.  The break certainly seems to cut off a lot of the history and continuity, but how drastic are the stylistic changes?<br />THE BURNING feels like an extremely low-key book after the excesses of the previous stories.  No planets are in jeopardy here and no time traveling voodoo cults are attempting to rewrite history.  The action is set entirely around a small English village at the end of the 19th Century that's experiencing some Who-style strange phenomena.  There's one man to the rescue, of course, but who is he, and why is he helping?<br />The plot is surprisingly weak considering that this was written by Justin Richards.  Several vital elements are given cursory descriptions and others aren't described at all.  It really is a credit to Richards' skill as a writer that the end product is as readable as it is; in the hands of a lesser writer, this story could really have turned into a complete mess.  As it exists now though, it is far from perfect.  Much of the actions of the main villain are left unexplained, as are the relationships between the human agent, the creature and their control of the elements.  The menace is never clearly explained, and while this may or may not have been done deliberately, I didn't care for the execution.  Had the monsters merely been rationalized as forces of nature or something along those lines, I think it would have worked a lot better.<br />The Doctor's &quot;new&quot; character is, of course, one of the most debated points of this book.  Certainly, he's a million times more interesting than the person seen in THE ANCESTOR CELL, though much of the interest comes from the lack of knowledge that we haverather than an abundance of new facts.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it's quite intriguing to have Doctor becoming a real mystery again.  We don't know where he's coming from, we don't know why he acts in the way that he does and we don't know the extent of his amnesia.  While this can be frustrating in a few places, it is a great hook to bring the reader back into the Doctor's story.<br />There were also some interesting passages concerning a determinism vs. free-will argument.  The Doctor and a reverend muse over the possibility that if Newton's laws of motion extend to every particle of matter in the universe, then everything that is going to happen is predetermined - anything we do could have already been predicted, if one had access to enough information about the movement of those particles.  The reverend can only surmise that the human soul somehow exists outside of these laws, but the Doctor doesn't seem so sure.  While some these discussions were quite interesting, in places they were a bit too blatant.  However, it was a nice parallel to the Doctor's emerging role in the story.  While he enters the story without much to do and lacking the drive or ability to change what's going on around him, by the end he has managed to take control of the situation, albeit shakily.  It's such a refreshing change after the past several books to actually see the Doctor involved in the plot and expressing himself on it.  The Doctor has always been the ultimate expression of free will in the universe and it's nice to see an author remember that.  Anything that compares the Doctor to the soul of the universe (even if it's just me reading too much into it) is all right by me.<br />In THE BURNING, we have an average story that is given a boost by putting some mystery and interest back into the character of the Doctor.  It's notable that after a large, universe-spanning story-arc, we're back to a remote setting with the Doctor simply helping people.  Despite the problems with the story, the book comes as a breath of fresh air and sparks hope and interest for the future.	2001-11-07
US	50631983	RVR30F81I6XJE	1556114249	609436434	No Laughing Matter	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Warm, funny, scary and vivid all at the same time	NO LAUGHING MATTER is a very informative and entertaining piece of writing.  Co-authored by Joseph Heller and Speed Vogel (who write alternating chapters) it details the effects of the rare debilitating affliction called Guillain-Barre syndrome.  This autobiographical/biographical chronicle passes along a lot of information without once falling into obscure medical dullness.<br />Guillain-Barre is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, rendering the victim completely paralyzed.  Although what Heller contracted was a mild form of the disorder, in an extreme case mentioned a patient was only able to move their eyes.  Recovery is possible from this disease; if it's caught early enough, the patient can be hooked up to a respirator if need be and then slowly rehabilitated.  NO LAUGHING MATTER is two stories.  The first is that of Joseph Heller the patient who goes from being in (seemingly) perfect health to being utterly bedridden in a matter of days.  The second part of the tale is told by Speed Vogel, a friend of Heller, who took care of virtually all of his financial, legal and personal obligations.<br />From reading some other reviews of the book, one might be under the impression that this is a light and fluffy feel-good story of friendship where one will be forced to read numerous passages on the deeper meanings of love and caring.  People learning great life lessons by sacrificing much that they have purely in the name of camaraderie.  Chicken soup for the soul and novocain for the brain.  Fortunately, one couldn't be further from the truth.  While the two authors obviously have a great fondness for each other, you won't find any obvious soliloquies on the healing power of friendship.  What you will find are people who care a great deal, but aren't afraid to share a lot of good-natured abuse.  While in sickness and on the road to recovery, this never feels false or sugarcoated.  It's an honest account of what real friendships are made of.<br />Despitethe title, much of the book is laugh out loud funny.  Heller may have been bedridden but he didn't lose any of his trademark wit.  Celebrity cameos of everyone from Dustin Hoffman to Mario Puzo to Mel Brooks help to liven up an already interesting narrative.  Both authors have a warm and engaging style of writing that makes even the more incomprehensible medical jargon understandable.  The jokes are great and serve also to counterpoint the feelings of desperation and of loneliness.<br />The book is extremely intriguing, though there are one or two sections that don't quite work.  Heller was going through what appeared to be a fairly messy divorce and the legal proceedings got a little bit complicated.  For a section, Heller even reproduces a few pages of the court transcripts in order to show his lawyer in the right.  As justified as he may be in including these segments, they aren't nearly as interesting as the rest of the book and pale in comparison.<br />NO LAUGHING MATTER shows us illness from two viewpoints.  From Vogel we see the outward appearance of the disease and its effect on Heller.  From Heller we experience the sickness firsthand.  It's a fascinating dual look at the nature of the affliction.  Well worth a read.	2001-10-31
US	50631983	R3LE4UUYKKHPIF	0426203593	512564596	Timewyrm: Apocalypse (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Paralyzingly dull, boring and tedious	When I first read TIMEWYRM: APOCALYPSE back in 1993 or 1994, it was only a matter of weeks later that I was unable to recall more than a handful of details about the book.  Rereading this in 2001, I recognized only the barest trivialities.  I don't expect to retain anything more from my reread than I did from my initial perusal of the text.<br />The prologue of the book begins with several one and two word sentences which are supposed to represent the primitive thoughts of the awakening adversary.  One and two word sentences never inspire the reader to have much confidence in the rest of the book, and sadly this assumption proves to be correct. One thing that any future authors can take away from this experience is that if one is going to base the first fifty pages of one's book off of a previous Doctor Who serial, do not redo The Krotons.  <br />The major problem with this book is that it is hopelessly padded and, worse, it's extremely dull padding.  The page count is just one over two hundred, yet strangely APOCALYPSE could easily lose about fifty pages without breaking a sweat.  There are far too many scenes of people being captured, escaping, running away from monsters, etc.  The style of prose does little to help move the plot along.  Sequences are broken up with numerous pages of random information about the way of life on Kirith.  These passages don't help to build up a picture of alien life, rather they just seem like irrelevant details.  It seems heavily influenced by the very worst of the Target novelisations.  When those books were at their poorest, they were nothing but lines of dialogue with random &quot;extra&quot; paragraphs of exposition.  This is exactly what many sections of this book feel like.  It isn't pretty.<br />Not to say that there aren't a few moments where the book is entertaining.  There's a sequence in which the Doctor is being chased through a forest that's realized quite effectively.  The passages involving the villagers awaking fromtheir long conditioning are also noteworthy.  Unfortunately for every one of these, we have something like the part where a seagull poos on the Doctor or one of the many useless facts about Kirithian culture.  One step forward, three steps back.<br />All in all the ending of the book is enjoyable enough, it's just a pity one has to read through all the other dull stuff in order to get to it.  This would make a much better novella if one, in addition to removing much of the padding, remembered that good writing involves more showing than telling.	2001-10-30
US	50631983	RFQBZXW99YUHN	0563538082	754053817	The Banquo Legacy (Doctor Who)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Excellence	BANQUO LEGACY is fantastic.  It's dripping with atmosphere, it has a cracking plot, and it feels miles away from being &quot;just another runaround&quot;.  This is such a relief after so many forgettable books (there's been so many of them before this, that I can't even remember when the last memorable book was) to have something that's just flat-out good.<br />The book is split into two memoirs.  One is written by a solicitor who is being paid to be an impartial witness to a scientific experiment.  The other is written by a police inspector who is called to the scene after everything goes fatally wrong.  Set in the 19th Century, the story feels very much at home in the culture of the original mad scientists and the stories of the intellectuals of the time.  The real authors of the book, Andy Lane and Justin Richards, set the stage wonderfully, with every detail fitting perfectly into the Victorian mystery novel that they've created.<br />There are some wonderful themes running through this book; the most satisfying and well executed would be the reflections upon seeing an objective reality from two differing, subjective standpoints.  This is most obvious in the narrative, as the overall story is told from the point of view of two different people.  This leads to a handful of overlapping scenes where certain details and events are described twice with slight differences in their recollection; it's an effect that's pulled off very nicely.  This theme also extends into the experiment that they are observing, which is based upon the placing of thoughts and experiences from one mind directly into another.  It crops up in one or two other places (most notable the sections involving Compassion) and is quite rewarding to the reader once one figures out what is going on.<br />The only real problems with this book are that the authors were so skillful at creating a late 19th Century atmosphere that the references to Time Lords, TARDISes and other anachronisms seem very muchout of place.  Perhaps there would have been a better way to incorporate these elements into the story without their metaphorical seams showing.  Despite these minor details, this is quite an enjoyable book and comes as a breath of fresh air.  Don't skip this one.	2001-10-22
US	50631983	R28K7OWC1KFVA7	0426203577	747856085	Timewyrm: Exodus (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	&quot;What we're seeing here are the effects of interference.&quot;	It sounds strange to say this about something that is primarily set during the Second World War, but TIMEWYRM: EXODUS is an amazingly fun book to read.  Of course, it's difficult to find anything in here that relates to the more disturbing elements of that war; this is the WWII of simplistic war films and novels, but it feels right at home with Terrance Dick's writing style.<br />As usual with Terrance Dick's books, the characterization of the regulars is excellent.  His Doctor is spot on; Dicks makes it look easy.  The Doctor gets all the best lines and all the best scenes.  He even gets the best costume, shedding his regular coat for a creepy black leather jacket.  Ace also gets some good scenes though there are one or two moments when she appears weaker than in past.<br />The plot runs at quite a pace and contains some of Dicks' best writing to date.  The whole if-Hitler-won scenario is handled quite well.  The view of what England would be like if it had lost the Second World War is interesting, but it is wisely kept to a short section before it can fall into one of the numerous science-fiction parallel universe clichés.<br />There are a few places where the author's Target television novelization experience comes back to haunt him.  A few characters give away elements of the plot by having them explain things to each other that surely they would already know.  But, thankfully, this is kept to a bare minimum.<br />The thought of the Doctor working his way behind the scenes in Nazi Germany is quite a disturbing concept.  Although I usually dislike the stories in which the Doctor hangs out with historical figures, Dicks manages to successfully portray Adolf Hitler as a historical figure by showing him at several points along his life (Dicks would use this method even more successfully in his later book, Players, in his depiction of Winston Churchill).  Having the Doctor meeting a real-life evil such as Hitler could have been an enormous disaster.  Fortunately theevents are handled with just the right amount of needed sensitivity.<br />There really isn't all that much to say about this book.  It almost defies discussion.  It's really good and that's all one needs to know.	2001-10-18
US	50631983	R2I2QC8QCKNMV4	0563538007	438628129	The Space Age (Doctor Who Series)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Falls far short of its potential	Where did THE SPACE AGE go wrong?  The premise to the book is fascinating.  It has several interesting things to say about maturing and the nature of conflict.  It even has a very good characterization of the Doctor.  So why was it such a chore to read?<br />From reading the back cover, one can tell that the setting of this book will be captivating.  It promises the flying cars and jetpacks that the future as seen from the 50s predicted.  It's the Year 2000 AD and mankind has an advanced civilization with hot and cold running robots and computers so that every single human need is taken care of.  The life of the each person can be spent in the pursuit of pleasure with none of the dirty work that everyday life in the present affords us.  Unfortunately after delivering this wonderful setup to the story, Steve Lyons does nothing with it.  After reading the book in its entirety, I can say that the story doesn't touch a fraction of the potential that it had going in to it.  With only a few alterations, the book could have been set almost anywhere.<br />The inhabitants of this Future City are all natives of an English town in 1965.  Somehow they were taken from their proper location and placed in this luxurious city.  Virtually everyone that was taken was a member of one of two 60s gangs, the mods and the rockers.  This sets up the middle of section of the book in which various people do very little else than beat the living daylights out of each other (and during the slow moments, they make elaborate plans about how they will next beat the living daylights out of each other).  It's extremely tedious, and unfortunately, this sort of boring runaround makes up almost the entire book.  Although I suspect this was done on purpose, it was difficult to read about the two groups, as they were virtually indistinguishable, so it was very hard to keep track of which side was which.<br />There are a few nice sections.  Compassion is barely featured in the book, but the little piecesthat we do get are extremely well written.  Also, there is some fairly interesting stuff about growing up and moving on.  The problem is that this theme is spread so thin that it almost isn't worth the effort - a shame this wasn't really followed up on.<br />In short, the beginning of book is super, the ending of the book is quite good, but the middle hundred and fifty odd pages or so are mind numbingly boring.  It's extremely frustrating to read as one can almost taste the excellent story that's down here begging to get out.  The sections that follow the end of hostilities reach excellence and it's really a shame that they didn't occur about fifty pages earlier.	2001-10-12
US	50631983	R34SH6UEY0H044	055356997X	158444901	I, Asimov: A Memoir	Books	4	37	39	N	N	I, Author	You can tell that Isaac Asimov really enjoys talking about himself.  But that's quite all right because his enthusiasm is contagious.  Divided into scores of essays three to four pages each, this book is a series of thoughts and reminisces that hold a basic chronological order, but skip around occasionally to properly place things into the perspective that he viewed them from at the time of his writing.  Asimov offers frank views on a variety of topics, ranging from his days in the army to his two marriages to his fellow science-fiction writers.<br />This is a very appealing collection of remembrances of a life that saw not just a lot of science fiction history and world events, but also of personal growth.  While there is a certain amount of repetition here, it works insofar as a person's life does involve a lot of revisiting the same paths.  Asimov says himself in the book that he hadn't really done a lot of things in his life.  He didn't travel and he spent most of his life inside his apartment typing away at his keyboard.  &quot;Didn't you notice,&quot; he once asked someone who had read and enjoyed his first two volumes of autobiographies, &quot;that nothing happened?&quot;  That the events described are not world-shattering is hardly a detriment to this book.  The witty and intelligent manner in which he describes even simple, everyday events is what makes this so engaging.<br />Asimov's life was consumed by his writing, and, not surprisingly, most of this book focuses on the hundreds of other books he wrote.  He describes in detail how many books he had written, how many he had edited, how many he had co-written.  It was an obsession that he did not hide or feel ashamed about.  He was proud of his many accomplishments in the literary field and felt no reason not to boast when he thought he deserved it.  (There is an amusing anecdote in which due to a last minute cancellation, he ends up unaware that he will be presenting an award to himself.  Afterwards, he asks the organizers why they chose him for the task and they replied that he was the only person they knew who wouldn't feel embarrassed about giving himself an award.)  The history of Asimov is the history of his writing, and the book details the numerous encounters and adventures that he had with various editors and publishing houses.  His passion for writing and the lengths he went through make for surprisingly fascinating reading.<br />Asimov was apparently fairly ill while he writing this book (he wrote with astonishing speed) though one would not realize that at first if one hadn't read the introduction.  Only a few hints are dropped through the beginning and middle of the book as Asimov seems slightly weary describing things that he knows he will never repeat or finish.  By the end of the book, Asimov describes some of the ills that have weakened his body.  He also expounds on his philosophies of life and death.  Despite what he knows he is facing, he comes across as being calm and rational about his impending death.<br />Knowing that Asimov died shortly after completing this book made the ending seem even more heartbreaking.  Although I had never met the man, I felt as though I had lost a friend.  The clarity of his writing is quite good at making the reader feel close to the man; his thoughts aren't hidden behind any deceitful or misleading prose.  He was a master at making himself crystal clear and the world will and does miss him.  A highly recommended memoir of a great writer.	2001-10-09
US	50631983	R25XERLZBVPWOV	0426203550	596105884	Doctor Who Timewyrm Genesis (New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Flawed, but enjoyable	Looking back at the first New Adventure, TIMEWYRM: GENESYS, it's hard not to crack a smile at the beginning paragraph of editor Peter Darvill-Evans' preface that reads, &quot;Here is an introductory word about Doctor Who - The New Adventures: continuity.&quot;  Fortunately, the words that follow make clear that the change in format will be taken to its fullest advantage and the Doctor and Ace will be traveling to places and worlds that would have been impossible for them to reach due to the limitations of the small screen.  We know now how successful this experiment became, but how much of this was evident at the very beginning?<br />When we first encounter Ace, she has conveniently lost all of her memories due to the Doctor's accidental meddling.  In keeping with the desire to tell stories that are more adult than could be shown on the BBC on Saturday evening, she has also conveniently lost all of her clothes.  Don't worry -- she pieces together her mind shortly after a lengthy dressing scene.  In having Ace gradually discover everything in her surroundings, John Peel gradually brings the casual reader up to speed with all the background details that he or she will need in order to understand the Doctor's adventures.  The Doctor quickly explains things to her, while using the TARDIS to restore the bulk of her memories.  This isn't a terrible idea (and ties up nicely with the memory circuits business at the end), but in execution it turns out rather poorly.  The scenes of the amnesiac Ace just keep going on and on while the Doctor has to explain more and more of the plot.  It was a nice idea to get some of the more difficult concepts across to the reader, but having this information dump lasting through multiple chapters just seems like cheating.<br />As for the gratuitous Ace nudity, sadly much of the book is equally as adolescent.  Although there are one or two scenes of this nature that are serviceable, add to the plot and don't come across as needless, there arefar too many scenes of people (usually teenage girls) wandering around naked with juvenile descriptions of their exposed parts.  I understand the difficulty that the author and editor must have had to go from the virtually nonexistent sense of sexuality of the television years to the grown-up and sophisticated version that could exist in book form.  Sadly, in this initial effort, the result is stuck somewhere in the middle of those and comes across as immature and childish. <br />The level of violence is also a little bit higher than we were used to on the show, though since blood and gore was something we had encountered before, it doesn't come across as that much of a difference.  It's also written with a tad more subtlety than the nudity scenes, and it isn't dwelt on.  Nevertheless, there are several battle sequences with rather high body counts.  People lose heads, lose limbs, have axes buried into their chests and stomachs, etc.  The violence comes across as being fairly cartoonish.  <br />The plot of the story is relatively simple, yet fairly enjoyable.  A cybernetic alien has crash-landed at Mesopotamia and is slowly preparing to use her powers of mind-control to enslave the human race.  Finding a warning that he left for himself several regenerations ago, the Doctor has come to this time period in search of something called the Timewyrm.  He finds the robotic alien who is masquerading as the Goddess Ishtar and attempts to put an end to her evil ways.  In doing so, he inadvertently unleashes the very creature he had hoped to defeat - the Timewyrm, who escapes at the end setting up the events of the following three books.<br />The characters aren't drawn terribly well.  The Doctor and Ace seem rather flat and generic.  One wonders why the Seventh Doctor needed to summon the Third Doctor to solve a problem, when he'd been acting like that incarnation the whole way through the story.  Gilgamesh is brought into the story, and in his opening sections he comes across as a fairly competent leader.  Unfortunately, in each of his subsequent scenes he loses what depth he had and by the middle of the book he's degenerated into a drunken, screaming, bellowing, fighting buffoon.  Ishtar herself is also portrayed a little strangely and I couldn't quite figure out her motivations.  It's explained that she is a very advanced being from an extremely sophisticated society, and yet almost immediately after landing she becomes caught up in a bunch of petty feuds among primitive civilizations.  To me it just didn't seem to flow correctly.<br />I have a few other small nit-picks.  No explanation or reason for Enkidu the Neanderthal existing 5,000 years after he should be extinct (this is acknowledged in the narrative, but not justified).  The endless continuity references that served no purpose other than to take up space.  The numerous typographical errors (was it just my copy, or did the font suddenly change at the bottom of page three?) and as these sorts of mistakes are things that I almost never catch, I'm guessing that there were a lot of other misprints that I didn't notice.  The Doctor and Ace arguing for no reason other than to artificially insert a level of angst that the story didn't require.<br />However, despite the problems with the characterization and sloppy prose, I was quite entertained while reading this.  It's a slight, but enjoyable read.  There are a lot of places that are a bit weak, but the pieces in between are very readable.  The Doctor gets quite a few good lines: &quot;I never make stupid mistakes, just very, very clever ones.&quot;  Although there are numerous problems, somehow the whole ends up being greater than the sum of its weak parts and makes for a fairly entertaining book.	2001-09-30
US	50631983	R10PATCDMAPER9	0563555955	970412841	Doctor Who : Coldheart	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Flawed, but faintly enjoyable	Somehow I enjoyed Trevor Baxendale's COLDHEART and I'm not entirely sure why that happened.  As I was reading it, I was mentally groaning at the weakness of the plot, the poor characterization and the obviously hasty rewrites to take the New Compassion into consideration.  Yet I kept turning the pages, interested in what was going to happen next.  It was derivative and unoriginal at every turn, and still it held my attention for the full two hundred and seventy-seven pages, which is quite a feat bearing in mind how thin the story is stretched.<br />The book has an annoying tendency to end virtually every chapter on a cliffhanger, and given that there are thirty chapters in the book, it means that the characters can't go for more than about ten pages or so without being shot at or grabbed by monsters.  This really puts quite a bit of unneeded padding into the story, though it might have been this quick pace that made the book as entertaining as it is.  Even though none of the sudden escapes, macho dialogue or improbable turnarounds ends up making any difference in the big picture, it does distract from the flimsiness of plot by slowing down the speed at which it is revealed.<br />This was such a visual book, that it's hard not to picture this as a novelisation of a television story that we never got to see.  While this does result in some breathtaking visuals, it also provides too many awkward moments.  Main portions of the plot are revealed by having two people explaining things to each other that they must surely already know.  This sort of exposition is allowable in television or film, but it just seems silly to do this in a novel.  In addition, there are far too many fight scenes that just don't work in written form.  Between these and the numerous unnecessary descriptions of decaying, mutating flesh and mucus (it's not horror, it's just gross), I could have been happy with a book that had about fifty to a hundred less pages.<br />I can't really say too much about why I enjoyed this.  I was not blind to its many flaws, yet despite them I was entertained by the overall story.  It isn't especially thrilling or exciting, but it is an enjoyable, if terribly light, read.  Just don't think about too much about the plot or the relationship that Fitz has with a camel.  Both will make your head spin.	2001-09-24
US	50631983	R2TSQRLPTXNYFT	0563555947	642782247	The Fall of Yquatine (Doctor Who (BBC))	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Disappointing	THE FALL OF YQUATINE was a bit of a disappointment to me.  While Nick Walter's previous book (DOMINION, his first solo work) created a very detailed alien race with a culture all its own, in this book the many details feel unnecessary.  Rather than coming together and forming a coherent picture of a different society, it feels more like a list of trivia facts about a solar system that he made up. The things we learn about the alien life-forms don't hold together to form a greater story and this really is a great shame, because that is something that Walters had done extremely well in DOMINION.<br />The plot itself unfolds rather enjoyably and is one of the few examples in Doctor Who where time travel itself is an important element.  Fitz becomes stranded a month in the past and is forced to live for that month knowing the future and being utterly unable to stop the terrible events he knows are going to occur.  Unfortunately, while the story at times is rather interesting, the narrative suffers from a great deal of telling and not showing, which is something that I find rather annoying.<br />One of the complaints I have about the characters presented here is that not one of them notices the larger picture of what is going on around them.  I suspect that this was done deliberately, and in fact this strategy does have some potential.  For example, one of the characters is presented slightly different depending on whose point of view we are seeing him through.  It's an interesting idea of how no one can truly know the objective nature of someone else; we've rarely seen in this sort of thinking in the book range before.  On the other hand, it doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the book.  If every character had been presented this way, it probably would have worked better, but to limit it to just one made that particular character seem a bit strange.  While other characters were drawn fairly objectively regardless of what any individual thought of them, the one anomaly seemed inconsistent with himself and everyone else until I figured out what was going on.  It just didn't seem to match.<br />Another problem with having characters that don't recognize the big picture is that all of them end up acting like complete morons.  No one has a bit of common sense about what the consequences of their actions are.  Unfortunately the characterization of the Doctor is one of the worst examples of this.  At the very beginning of the book, having physically and mentally assaulted Compassion (albeit completely unintentionally), he doesn't go for more than a page before he's changed subjects and started wibbling on about ducks.  Then he gets back to the subject only start yapping about the ducks less than two pages after that.  While I don't mind the Doctor being easily distracted, it feels completely wrong for him to be unable to focus his mind after having made such an enormously negative impact on one of his traveling companions.  This should be a major event in his relationship with Compassion, but he can't even concentrate on it for more than a few moments.  It's very unsettling.  Fortunately most of his worst qualities disappear after the first hundred pages or so, but it still does not result in telling a story about a character that I care enough to read about.<br />Fitz's subplot is familiar to any regular reader of the EDAs, so there will be no real surprises here.  Separated from the Doctor, Fitz must learn to survive on his own in an alien environment.  He finds a job and a gal and must then leave the planet and the girl before a giant catastrophe occurs.  Those last two sentences could describe the Fitz subplot in at least three EDAs, though, fear not, I'm still reviewing THE FALL OF YQUATINE here.  The Fitz sections aren't terrible, but they aren't especially engaging either.  Unfortunately, the fact that we've seen this exact scenario played out many times in previous books works very much to this book's detriment.<br />All in all,this is a book with several interesting pieces, but a lot of little flaws.  It's exciting in some places, yet it never really feels like it gets going.  Although I've spent most of this review pointing out the things I did not enjoy, there are some very entertaining portions of this story.  The parts of the book that deal with Compassion and the changes that have occurred are quite well written and are far and away the best sections.	2001-09-20
US	50631983	R2VVZBPNH0SUM5	0786708735	230415038	Pulp Masters	Books	4	29	30	N	N	Very appealing collection	This is a very enjoyable set of crime stories from several of the most famous names in the genre.  Contained within are six stories: five longish short stories (or novelettes) and one short novel.  I have read very little of these types of pieces before, so I was unable to compare them to other examples of this genre.  But as they say, I may not know trashy pulp novels from the middle part of the Twentieth Century, but I know what I like, and this collection is well worth reading.<br />As I said, I don't know much about written crime stories, though I have seen my fair share of the films from this era.  There's something very enticing about these stories of gangsters, cops and private eyes.  Every woman is a blonde and every case has a solution.  These aren't the most realistic stories in the world, but you'll have to go far to find more enjoyable ones.<br />&quot;The Embezzler&quot; by James M Cain, 1938 - This is quite an interesting story set in and around a city bank.  Money is missing, and a bank employee must figure out who is embezzling the money and how.  A nicely realized romance between the protagonist and the wife of the suspect helps break up the action pleasantly.  The ending feels a bit contrived, as if the author was forced to tack on a happy ending, but the story itself is very entertaining.<br />&quot;Ordo&quot; by Donald E. Westlake, 1977 - An interesting character study of a woman who leaves town and becomes a world-famous movie star.  It's told through the eyes of a man she was married to before she became famous.  It's a great story that will keep you intrigued the whole time.  Fairly simple concept, but the execution raises up the quality of the entire piece.<br />&quot;Stag Party Girl&quot; by Lawrence Block, 1965 - A whodunit that doesn't quite live up to its full potential.  The premise and investigation are fairly interesting, but the ending falls a bit flat.<br />&quot;College-Cut Kill&quot; by John D. MacDonald, 1950 - This one seems to be structured very similar to the previous story, though it has the advantage of being slightly better executed.  The killer's motivation is far too similar to that of the murderer in &quot;Stag Party Girl&quot;.  It was probably a mistake to include these two stories next to one another in a collection.  Placing a story or two in between them would helped to shadow the similarities.<br />&quot;Everybody's Watching Me&quot; by Mickey Spillane, 1953 --  A story of established gangsters who fear news of the arrival of one of the deadliest hit-men in the country.  I didn't care for this story.  While the premise is sound enough, there are far too many factions to keep track of in such a small space.  There are two difference police departments, several groups of gangsters, a drug supplier, a hired killer, a newspaper reporter, the narrator, the narrator's love interest and his mysterious informer.  Perhaps if this was a longer piece there would be more room to develop all these characters and sub-plots, but as the story is, they are just too underdeveloped and confusing.  The ending is a surprise, but, unfortunately, it falls apart once you start putting some thought into it.<br />&quot;So Dead My Love&quot; by Harry Whittington, 1953 - This is the only full novel in the collection though it was a relatively short one.  This was quite an enjoyable read.  The story is set in a small town in the South, featuring a man who grew up there but then left to become a private investigator in New York.  When he's called back to his roots, he must locate a missing person while avoiding the old feuds and power politics that caused him to leave in the first place.  This was probably the most entertaining read in the collection.  I couldn't wait to see what the protagonist was going to uncover next in this small town.  All the characters and their relationships were well explained, and by the end of the story I was able to completely understand how the hero felt about the place he grew up in.<br />All in all, this was a very appealing collection.  I hadn't read much of the genre before this anthology, but now I have a few more authors that I think I will be looking up to read more of.  Recommended.	2001-09-07
US	50631983	R1FYYNYPZ64OPI	0563555904	244707639	Parallel 59 (Doctor Who (BBC))	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Inconsistent	PARALLEL 59 is a sadly incoherent book, with some really clichéd and dull portions being countered by moments of great interest and wonderful writing. There are some instances of rather clever storytelling at work here, but unfortunately the majority of them get bogged down by formulaic portions that do nothing more then tell the same old story that we've seen many times already.<br />The story is neatly divided into two sections with Fitz immediately becoming separated from the Doctor and Compassion. The Doctor and Compassion are captured by a government task-force and mistaken for spies while Fitz has adventures at a place called Mechta where things are not quite what they seem. Boiled down to their basic elements, both segments are fairly unoriginal, but the Fitz sections manage to rise above expectations due to the inspired execution. One mistake made is that for the second book in a row, Fitz begins an ill-fated romance with a native of the environment that he finds himself marooned in. PARALLEL 59, while not doing a bad job in this department, pales when compared to the Fitz relationship portrayed in FRONTIER WORLDS.<br />The sections containing the Doctor and Compassion rarely move beyond the type of adventure that we've seen time and time again, though to balance this out there are some hilarious portions mixed in. The secondary characters in this section all seem rather bland and faceless. There's the group of outlaws that we know so well from various other Doctor Who stories. There's also the large government-controlled project featuring bureaucratic types that we've seen in those same previous Doctor Who stories. Add one or two double-agents, and you're left with the entire dull cast. None of these characters leap off the page and become anything more than the simple two-dimensional figures we've been seeing.<br />Overall, this book was fairly disappointing, yet there were one or two very entertaining sections, and the further adventures of Fitz were rather enjoyable. I wouldn't mind reading further solo books from either of these two authors in the future, but I don't think their styles were really suited for co-authorship. It led to a feeling of inconsistency here that was very distracting.	2001-09-06
US	50631983	R2EA28EOMOLOFW	0345332318	205536648	Invasion of the Ormazoids (Doctor Who, Find Your Fate, No 5)	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Not one of the more entertaining Find Your Fate books	I believe that I must have adored the Find Your Fate books when I was much younger. Certainly, the copies I currently own (retained from my youth) bare the markings of extreme use.  In our day, after trudging three or four miles back and forth to school, we youngsters didn't have fangled, complicated video games to take our minds off of gruel and dirt, so we had to resort to the Find Your Own Adventure Books in order to satisfy our desires to interact with fiction.  Okay, so much of that previous sentence is a lie, but many of these books actually were a lot of fun to an eight-year-old.<br />Sadly, INVASION OF THE ORMAZOIDS isn't the best Doctor Who Find Your Fate Adventure available.  Philip Martin doesn't seem particularly suited to the second-person narration aspect of these books, and a lot of the book seems very contrived.  The protagonist of the novel, the ubiquitous &quot;you&quot; is (according to the illustrations) a fairly androgynous looking, person, who upon meeting the Doctor immediately forgets his or her name and swipes a moniker from the TARDIS control panel.  The two of you (mostly you) wander around in the twenty-fifth century at the edge of the universe trying to seize control of the Master Genetic Code Signifier.  The Master Genetic Code Signifier is a device that, when properly used, allows the user to create perfectly synchronized ballroom dancers.  In the wrong hands, this could lead to galactic domination.  Or something.  An evil guy called Darval is looking for a good galactic domination weapon and has designs on the aforementioned Master Generic Code Signifier.  You have to stop him and the only way you can prevent the dastardly plan from coming to fruition is to blast things with lasers.<br />The book isn't terribly appealing from a Doctor Who standpoint.  Most paths that you can take end up with you separated from the Doctor and forced in to a fairly standard action adventure.  It's not overly interesting and most of the time it doesn't really feel like a Doctor Who adventure.  I'd recommend some of the other FYF books, in which you actually get to interact with the Doctor and his companions.<br />(A warning.  K9 appears on the cover but isn't in the actual text of the book, so try not to be too heartbroken when the little fellow doesn't appear.)	2001-08-23
US	50631983	RTU8XAXG6X01W	0563555890	24215146	Doctor Who: Frontier Worlds (Doctor Who (BBC))	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A fun action/adventure	FRONTIER WORLDS is one of the most entertaining EDAs that I've read.  It's a fairly standard runaround with a relatively unambitious plot, but it's so well written that we can forgive it that.  The characters and their adventures are built up very convincingly, making this book feel above the average output of the BBC line.<br />This is the first book in which Compassion reads more like a companion than a grumpy, faceless, arc-related plot-device.  Fitz also comes across quite well, and the adventures of the two companions separated from the Doctor make for very worthwhile reading.  Peter Anghelides has really brought to life two companions who had started to slip into blandness in the preceding books.  Their interaction suddenly made the two of them appear like real people, rather than just generic characters hanging out inside the TARDIS.  Telling much of the story from Fitz's point of view raised the book from a fairly standard runaround to an interesting story told with a lot of wit.<br />The Doctor is not present for a significant portion of the adventure, though the scenes he is present for are rather enjoyable.  For once, he seems mostly in charge and actually appears to know what's going on around him.  This is such a refreshing change after so many of the previous books in which the Doctor is removed from the plot (sometimes by other characters, sometimes by the author) and contributes almost nothing to the story.  Although Fitz and Compassion get more on-screen time, the lack of active involvement by the Doctor doesn't diminish the appearances that he does have.  He's charming, witty, easily distracted, intelligent and resourceful - everything that the Eighth Doctor has the potential to be.<br />A lot of what I have praised the book for sounds rather simplistic.  It's the execution of these simple ideas that makes the book as delightful as it is.  It doesn't shake up the Doctor Who world beyond all recognition, but it is a very fun book that tells an entertaining tale.  It's a simple story, but it feels fresh and new.  Recommended.	2001-08-23

I must agree with other reviewers who have stated that the authors don't appear to be comfortable working with the ideas and themes developed by other writers.  This is unfortunate because almost the entire story is nothing but ideas that have been pulled from previous books (most notably, Lawrence Miles' ALIEN BODIES).  The concepts never evolve past the point of being Someone Else's Creation, and the result is that nothing feels as though it has any consequence at all.<br />There are a few good ideas contained in the book, but almost every one of them fails to yield anything of further interest after being stretched out to their full potential.  I'll use an example from the very beginning of the book: the Museum of Things That Don't Exist.  When this is first mentioned in the story, there's a certain air of mystery about the place.  It certainly sounds like an idea brimming with creative potential and something that the Doctor Who format could do particularly well, especially in novel form.  The problem with it is that when we actually get there, the museum turns out to be dead boring.  Instead of surreal displays or books of magical and unexplained happenings we end up with nothing more than reconstructions of a few hoaxes and fictions that would only be significant to someone from Twentieth Century Earth.  A nice idea ruined by poor execution, which is indicative of the majority of the flaws present in this book.<br />The plot is very complicated and there are several things going on at once.  This results in the people involved in the story coming across as rather shallow.  There simply isn't room inside the story for all of these characters.  This is a pity as there are one or two there who seem like they could have been quite interesting, if only there had been room enough to flesh them out completely.  <br />There are one or two bright points in the book.  The Interludes are very strongly written and effectively convey some of the concepts that the main portion of the book had neglected.  The Doctor is characterized well in the portions that he's in; it's a pity that those portions are so few and far between.  The book seems far more concerned with relating more pieces of the future war between the Time Lords and the enemy than it does with telling a full story.  This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing except that it takes the Doctor out of the main thrust of the story right from the beginning, and the hints about the War (and the fate of the Celestis) simply aren't interesting enough to sustain the book purely on their own.   But these hints and disclosures are all that we have here.<br />All in all, the presence of several big concepts and arc-related revelations don't prevent this book from ending up being extremely dull.  It's not a poorly written book, just one that feels more like a vessel for bigger things to be put through it, never once standing up and existing on its own merits.  It tries to be hard-SF by throwing around a lot of scientific gobbledygook, but it's never quite as clever as it thinks it is.	2001-08-20

The Eighth Doctor segments are also divided up into smaller pieces, each slice not necessarily taking place at the same time as the others.  At times, it can be a very confusing read, although ultimately the experience is very rewarding.  During a few points I had to stop reading and make mental notes about how exactly the story was unfolding and which pieces were occurring in what order.  While the book definitely made me work harder at reading it than others in the EDA line, this change was quite welcome and the pay-off well worth it.<br />As I mentioned, this story is dripping with atmosphere.  The tone is set right from the very beginning -- this is a very dark story.  It's also a very well told story.  Lawrence Miles isn't interested in what technological nonsense the Doctor will use to escape from a prison cell; he wants to go deeper than that.  He isn't interested in having Sam repeat some clichéd Save The Whales slogan; he wants to explore her mind and her mentality.  He's using the conventional tools of Doctor Who to tell a story that reaches outside of the normal parameters of what we expect when we see the blue logo on the cover.  But he's not kicking down the ladder of Doctor Who after he's climbed up it; Sam's beliefs and experiences form the very heart of the book.  Sam's politics aren't just a springboard for Miles to say Bigger and Better things about Politics, they remain under the microscope during the entire book.  Miles has merely taken everything that we know about Sam and drawn them out to their logical conclusion.  Who would have guessed that the result would make for such fascinating reading?<br />As in ALIEN BODIES, this story is packed full of great ideas and new pieces of excellent continuity.  Here they all fit together much better and work at forming a cohesive work. The little asides and narrative passages that dragged the plot of ALIEN BODIES to a standstill work rather effectively here.  Despite its massive length, there's very little (in the Earth sections) that doesn't contribute to the overall tone of the work.  Everything just feels right, even the passages where the Doctor comforts a tortured and dying political prisoner with stories about a fantasy world of TARDISes and Time Lords.  I think that in the hands of a lesser writer, this section could really have turned out tobe rather embarrassing, but fortunately Miles knows what he's doing and treats the subject with the delicacy it deserves.  Extra points are given for not tiptoeing around the subject matter.<br />In my opinion, the biggest flaw is that the themes and atmosphere don't translate properly from one part of the story to the other.  The Eighth Doctor segment is about the effect of media and culture upon society, the way perceptions change people, and how close perceptions of people come to reality.  With only a few exceptions, these themes are totally absent from the Third Doctor segments.  The only thematic link between them seems to be Fitz's ruminations on how he is perceived (and how he will be remembered by others) and a character in the Third Doctor segments who is proud of the fact that no one will ever be able to get close enough to know the real her.  The jumps between the Earth and the Dust segments seemed much more jarring because of this.  If the themes had been held together more coherently, I think this would have ended up being one of the best (if not the best) Doctor Who stories written.  As it stands, it's still extremely good, but somewhere well below perfection.  The difference in tone between the two segments is unfortunately distracting.<br />All in all this is a really excellent book that is unfortunately let down by a few flaws.  While the book does fall slightly short of some of it's goals, it must be commended for daring to aim so high.  With the publication of INTERFERENCE, the bar has been raised for all other Doctor Who books and stories.  Thank you, Lawrence.	2001-08-14

US	50631983	R2C5AB8QJFZU3V	0684868199	356170343	Picture This : A Novel	Books	3	10	11	N	N	A large work	PICTURE THIS is an enormous and sprawling work.  I do not mean large in the word-count (though it's no slouch in this category) but in the scope.  The back cover summary promises a &quot;jaunt through 2,500 years of Western civilization&quot; and it certainly delivers that.  Unfortunately the result is a mixture of good and bad.  At its best, it can be spellbinding, but at its worst it comes across as a fairly boring history lesson.<br />The book is vaguely centered around a piece of artwork that a Sicilian nobleman named Don Antonio Ruffo paid five hundred guilders for Rembrandt to produce.  The painting is that of the Greek philosopher Aristotle contemplating a bust of the Greek poet and storyteller Homer.  Using this foundation as a springboard, Joseph Heller jumps back and forth in time giving different perceptions on a number of different concepts.  Money, power and art are just a few of the topics that Heller touches on and for the most part, as the expression goes, the more things change the more they stay the same.  There are some memorable insights into the role that war, commerce, etc. have played in society.<br />On the other hand, PICTURE THIS does tend to get weighed down underneath its grandiose pretensions.  While much of the book discusses the relation that history has to the concepts it contains, there are far too many passages that are just dry rehashes of historical documents.  This is most apparent in the sections concerning the Greek philosophers where, at worst, the book spends several pages just rephrasing the events and philosophies that Plato described in APOLOGY, CRITO and THE REPUBLIC.  Although these sections can be interesting (probably even more so to any readers who aren't already familiar with them) they are not always related to the rest of the story.  For some of these sections, one would be better off reading the actual texts rather than just the summary of them included here.<br />The main sections of the book are split between long discussions about the wars of the ancient Greek world and numerous lectures upon the role of money/commerce in the Dutch society of Rembrandt's era.  Some of it is extremely interesting.  Some of it is stunningly dull.  There are some very clever themes that run throughout the book such as the portrait of Aristotle being sentient and able to give a commentary on how different and similar life is in Rembrandt's time to that of his own.  As readers in the beginning of the 21st Century, we can are also able reflect upon how their life is similar to ours.  Heller is aware of this and lets the narrative play around with this idea, and while it isn't totally successful in every case, it's effective enough to be very powerful.<br />This book definitely has some gems contained within it.  Just be warned that there is a lot of padding in between.  While it's ultimately a rewarding experience, there are portions of it that are just tedious to read.	2001-08-11
US	50631983	R105JERY7DJL4C	0385334206	739505736	Breakfast of Champions: A Novel	Books	5	8	9	N	N	One of the most perfect books I've ever read	BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS is a book that is so full of strange ideas, altered realities, and different perceptions that it's a little like reading a nervous breakdown at times.  There  is so much going on, that you may find yourself going back and reading a page three or four times just to pull everything that you can out of it.  And just when you think it can't get any more insane, Kurt Vonnegut places the author of the book into the story-line itself as the Creator Of The Universe, but goes out of his way to give this author a name different to his own.  Confusing?  Yes.  Enjoyable?  Absolutely.<br />This book covers a wide range of topics.  Racism, sexism, mental imbalance, chemistry, life, death, and literally hundreds of other subjects are discussed.  The plot is set out in a very simple way so that Vonnegut has room to let his characters and himself entertain a variety of thoughts.  The prose of the book is very detailed about the most mundane of material.  Vonnegut can cleverly point to the absurdity of everyday things, merely by describing them in minute terms without resorting to overbearing judgments.  By just reducing everything to its most basic components, he can show the flaws present in the most basic of fundamentals.<br />This minutiae even extends to the basics of story telling.  By placing &quot;the author&quot; inside the fictional narrative, Vonnegut can point out some of the fundamentals of writing.  Since no detail about a person is inherently more important than any other, there are times were we get an information dump of seemingly random information about the characters in the story.  The question that comes to mind: is all of this information really irrelevant?  If the author saw fit to include it, does it matter that the data doesn't relate to the narrative?<br />In summary, it's almost impossible to summarize most, or even much, of what Kurt Vonnegut has written about here.  This is such a very densely written book that it would take twice the length of BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS in order to talk about it properly.  And even with all of the ideas and thoughts contained within, the book never feels bloated or incoherent.  It's philosophical, entertaining, bizarre, thought-provoking and hilarious.<br />It's good.  Highly recommended.  Rush out and read it now.	2001-08-05

The Daleks appear to be much more of a threat, the Doctor acts with greater intelligence, and the continuity references are slightly less annoying and confusing.  Unfortunately, it's still not a very good book.<br />The beginning of the story has a lot going for it.  Set thirty years after the end of the Dalek invasion, we see Earth gradually putting itself back together after years of occupation, death camps and war.  There's a strange mix of technologies and customs as modern tools and weapons are used alongside cultural throwbacks from centuries ago.  England has again become a land of bickering Lords; knights roam the countryside doing good deeds.  Of course, since this is the 22nd Century, the knights are armed with futuristic weapons and machine guns in addition to their more traditional accompaniments.  There is some interesting development at the start where we see some of the power struggles that are going on as the factions of surviving humans battle it out for dominance.  Resources are scarce.  The production and selling of energy is a major factor in how much power and influence one has.  So far, so good.<br />It's the moment in which the Daleks first appear that the story starts falling apart for me.  Up until this point the book had the potential for a lot of interesting political and military maneuvering as the different Lords vie for control.  But once the Daleks show up, that goes out the window and all we are left with are some long, pointless battle-sequences and Daleks issuing reports to each other.  The interest that had been built up surrounding the remaining humans and their plight is quashed and we're left with extended battles and overblown scheming from shallow villains.<br />As in WAR the characterizations are extremely poor.  The Doctor appears more like the eighth than in WAR, but he has frequent lapses into his third and fourth personas.  The secondary characters arealmost universally poor.  These aren't people - they're vessels for the plot (what there is of it) who have no reason for existing other than to say things that drive the story forward.  There's no consistency about them either; they say or do whatever is needed of them at the time regardless of how much it jars with their previously established character.  At no point did I feel that I was reading about human beings.<br />The poor characterizations would not have been as inexcusable had there been an absorbing plot going on around them.  Unfortunately, this book is pretty much a complete runaround with very little in it to inspire interest.  The Doctor and company run around, get locked up, escape, get threatened by men with guns, escape again, run around, etc.  There is not much substance here.<br />All in all, it would probably be better to skip this book.  Although it takes place in the middle of the Sam Is Missing story-arc, the related threads are only at the beginning and end of the book.  You won't miss anything important or entertaining if you decide to read something else.	2001-08-01

MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 was one of the funniest shows on the air, and, as head writer, Mike Nelson was probably one of the most influential people working for the show. What I worried about was whether the jokes and jeers that he had made over the years would work in review form where we don't have the sheer awfulness of the film to look at. I am glad to say that all of my fears were greatly unfounded. This book is hilarious and scores a solid bull's-eye for every target that it takes aim at.<br />While the television series was stuck with only making fun of low-budget howlers that no one had heard of, here Nelson is free to mock any movie or celebrity he feels like. He certainly doesn't pull any punches; Bruce Willis, Adam Sandler, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG, THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY and other worthy contenders are all mercilessly heckled here in a way that should be very familiar to any fan of MST3k. The jokes come fast and furious and, just like the show, if you don't pay attention, a lot of funny material will pass you by.<br />The book is vaguely organized into five sections, and consists of scores of short essays and reviews on current films and celebrities. No offering lasts for more than four pages, so if there's something in there you don't like (if you have a fanatical devotion to EVENT HORIZON or Carrot Top) then you don't have very far to read until the next selection. These short bursts prevent the book from falling into dull repetition; there are not really too many things that one can say about WHAT DREAMS MAY COME so the book never feels like it's outstaying it's welcome -- quick joke and then onto the next film. Who would have thought that Sex Pistols songs and movie reviews would have so much in common?<br />In any case, this book comes with the highest of recommendations. Even if he blasts one of your favourite films or actors, you still won't be able to resist laughing. And if the above wasn't recommendation enough, there's a killingly funny photograph on the back inside cover of Mr. Nelson in a smoking jacket, holding a pipe and wearing the most pretentious expression you'll ever see on a man who spoke to puppets for five years. Own it.	2001-08-01
US	50631983	RGP8Q384B1TQG	0563555734	781538083	Players (Doctor Who Series)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Another solid adventure	I'm not usually a big fan of Doctor Who stories where the main characters have adventures with historical figures.  Not to say that this situation can't be and hasn't been done well, but the usual result is that the historical events end up being cheapened and the sense of history never gets properly conveyed.  So when I read on the back-cover blurb of PLAYERS that the Doctor and Peri were going to be having adventures with (among other people) Winston Churchill, I hoped that I wouldn't be disappointed with the result.  <br />Thankfully, I wasn't.  Terrance Dicks has done a wonderful job of making his Churchill appear like the historical figure he was and doesn't let him fall into the trap of being just another character who happens to have a famous name.  By allowing us to view Churchill over the course of several decades, a real sense of history is established.  This lets us view Churchill in the proper context; he's a real person who has done hundreds of things before without contact with the Doctor.  He has his own life and his own place in the history books.  This may seem like a simple thing to setup, but I've seen far too many instances where this background isn't established and the result is that there is no connection between the real person and the fictional version used in the story.  Dicks passes with flying colours here.  With the periodic dips into Churchill's timeline it seems more like the Doctor is jumping in and out of Churchill's personal biography rather than just pulling Churchill into his own otherworldly adventures.<br />The story itself is straightforward without being totally simplistic.  Aliens (the Players of the title) are attempting to manipulate the course of human history for their own bored amusement.  The plot is slightly frustrating in that the back-cover summary tells the reader exactly what the Players are up to, but until almost the conclusion, the characters in the book are virtually oblivious to any of their machinations.  Another annoyance is that by the end of the story the reader hasn't learned much more about the Players than what the blurb has already informed us of.  Fortunately, the sections that deal specifically with the Players (they exist behind the scenes and rarely make personal appearances) are done stylishly enough to compensate for the lack of explanation.<br />For the most part, the characterization of the sixth Doctor and Peri are handled very well, especially in the beginning section.  There are a few places towards the middle and end where Dicks seems to forget the bombastic nature of the sixth Doctor, but overall, he's got them spot on.  Even the extended portion featuring the second Doctor is done well, which should not be a surprise after all of Dicks' Target novelisations.<br />All in all this was an entertaining, fast-paced book that kept me interested the whole way through.  During the reading of it, I kept having flashbacks to Terrance Dicks' Target novelisations, but I mean that in the best possible way.  While a lot of those books have been criticized for being shoddy, cut-n-paste hack jobs, some of them were excellent examples of the best of Doctor Who.  There were only a few places were the comparison to Targets was unflattering and that was the numerous paragraphs that consisted entirely of passages like: &quot;The Doctor brought Churchill up to date and told him of their adventures while Churchill laughed loudly.&quot;  These information dumps for the varying characters seemed to crop up in far too many places, were very annoying and really broke up the pace of that section.  On the other hand, for every one of those present there were numerous places in which his minimalist prose style really helped to quicken the pace and tighten the action.  Terrance Dicks has been writing these characters for (literally) decades, and the result is that he can make it look easy and effortless.  When he's on form, he can produce some of the most enthralling Doctor Who fiction out there.  This is not an example of his best work, but it's certainly not his worst and it comes recommended.	2001-07-30

Grant's career from his very early days in WITHNAIL &amp; I all the way through to his role in the Spice Girls movie, SPICEWORLD.  A varied career indeed.  It's fascinating to read about his rollercoaster ride through filmmaking, bouncing from gigantic bombs to critical successes in a seemingly random fashion.<br />This is a captivating look at the behind the scenes activities from several movie sets, yet Grant manages to keep both his feet firmly planted on the ground even when meeting and socializing with the biggest of stars.  The result is an often hilarious tour of the madness and method that goes into making films.  We encounter several very famous people within this text: Grant parties with Madonna, receives multiple high-fives from Bruce Willis, accepts strange fan-mail from Steve Martin and gets stuck on a never ending film-shoot in Budapest with Sandra Bernhard.  Each of them are seen through his grounded eyes and interacted with in his neurotic, slightly sarcastic manner.  <br />Although this is not even a complete account of all (or most) of the films that he has acted in throughout his career, there are a few places where his private life does occasionally intersect on the pages of his diaries.  There are some extremely tear-jerking moments, the most moving of which is during the shooting of WITHNAIL &amp; I where he is caught going back and forth between the film work and his wife's pregnancy complications.  The book is a whirlwind of emotions and random observations.  It's slow and thoughtful during the breaks between shooting, but quickly speeds up to a breakneck pace when the real work begins.<br />This is a great book for anyone who has the slightest interest in a behind the scenes peek at the movie industry from someone who doesn't have their head already in the clouds.  Richard E. Grant shares his philosophies, his outlooks and his wit with us in these diaries and they come highly recommended.	2001-07-24

Any attempt to wrap the reader in its narrative, ends jarringly when one comes across a sentence or fragment that would make the English students in the readership cringe.<br />The story itself isn't all that bad.  There is nothing really the matter with it, but there is also nothing much positive to say about it either.  Some books with a weak storyline can turn this perceived limitation into a strength by adding character conflict, angst or introspection (with varying degrees of success).  Here the lack of plot is made up for with long war scenes that pay more attention to the tanks and equipment than it does to the people that are operating them.  This contributes to the uncaring feel that the book has, as though nothing that one is reading matters in any tangible way.  By the time one reaches the end, one does not really notice that the conclusion has been rushed through.  Although this sort of sloppy writing at the finale is a problem that plagues many an EDA, it seems strangely appropriate here.<br />The prose and the sentence structure are really where this novel collapses.  Strange sentence fragments joined together by random punctuation marks become distracting at times and very detrimental to the reading experience.  This is a book that would have been enormously helped by an extra stage of proofreading and/or editing.  It's a shame that this did not occur.<br />The characterization of the regulars was, for much of the time, fairly acceptable.  However, there were a few points where the Eighth Doctor seemed more like the Seventh Doctor than we've ever seen him before.  Fitz seemed to waver a lot between two extremes: one of total cowardice and the other of tremendous heroics.  This seemed almost like a caricature at times, though it did work well in some places.  Sam is much less annoying than she usually is (which is a pleasant surprise) though her decision at the very end seems to come from absolutely nowhere.<br />In the end, reading this failed to generate any excitement in me whatsoever.  Events happened and some people were killed, but I couldn't make myself care about any of this.  The &quot;third side&quot; referred to on the back cover tries to dance between magical and hard, scientific technobabble, and ultimately fails at being either.  Not recommended.	2001-07-18
US	50631983	RS70GD861AQ09	0563555769	180905498	Unnatural History (Doctor Who Series)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	There's a lot going on here	There are a lot of things going on in UNNATURAL HISTORY.  The good news is that the great majority are wonderfully intriguing, appealing and well written.  The bad news is that because there are so many, they come across at times as being superficial and not fully developed.  This is indeed very frustrating although the overall effect isn't enough to take away from the book as a whole.<br />First of all, we finally get to meet the oft-hinted-at Dark Sam.  While the regular (blonde) Sam Jones is a squeaky clean (and at times dead boring) defender of causes, the Dark Sam is an altered version who has had thoughts and experiences that the original would never have dreamed of.  Unfortunately, not much of this seems to affect her, and the Dark Sam is soon blindly trusting the Doctor and being innocuous in exactly the same way that she would have normally.  She smokes, drinks and has done drugs in the past, but her character isn't significantly different - she still speaks and acts in the same manner.  I had to keep reminding myself that this was supposed to be a changed person.<br />Now I realize that one of the themes of the book is that the past is not as important to the present and the future as the present itself is.  I get the impression that Dark Sam was deliberately made inoffensive to re-enforce this philosophy; Dark Sam can have a different and more dangerous, gritty past than Blonde Sam, yet she still is, at her core, the same person.  This may indeed be an interesting train of argument (and it definitely works well in the confines of this story) but extending the theme into the Dark Sam subplot didn't seem to work as well.  In fact, it took me almost the first hundred pages or so to figure out what they were doing with her.  And coincidentally it was around the point at which I realized this that they started bringing some of the darker aspects into the foreground.  Although this did begin to distinguish her from the Blonde Sam it didn't seem to quite do enough, though I realize that this was probably the point.<br />That said, I thought the rest of the story was quite enjoyable.  There are some wonderfully written sequences that are a joy to read.  The &quot;Wild Hunt&quot; effect when Sam's mind would react to her past being re-written was executed tremendous well.  This section highlighted the things that I enjoy the most in Ormanblum books; it's slightly surreal, it's full of wonderful imagery and it's true to the character going through the experience.  I thought that there was only a single piece of wasted potential and that was that we only saw the occurrence through Sam's eyes.  Since it was a slightly hallucinogenic experience I would have been interested to see Fitz and the Doctor's reaction to going through the same phenomenon and how it compared to Sam's.  But this is only a minor quibble and did not detract from my enjoyment of the sequences.<br />Unlike some of their previous books, there are not very many secondary characters in the story.  Instead it focuses on the three regulars (well, two regulars and one altered) and gives more attention over to the plot.  The only downside to this is that there seems to be too much going on to fully justify the inclusion of everything<br />Despite some imperfections this is a story worth reading and is the best book in the Doctor Who range since THE FACE-EATER.	2001-07-13
US	50631983	R1BEDT5XY4JRYB	0563555742	486417986	Dominion (Doctor Who Series)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Enjoyable and a good debut novel	There are a number of places in which DOMINION demonstrates the fact that this is Nick Walters' first solo novel.  The narrative is a little unsure in areas, as if he isn't absolutely certain how to express his story properly.  And yet in other portions, the prose seems almost effortless, as if he's swinging back and forth between doubt and confidence.  Despite these problems, this is quite an enjoyable, if relatively simple, tale.<br />It's obvious that Walters has put a lot of thought into the characters and world he has created, and the results are well worth it.  There are a few places where the characterization appears slightly off and a little unrealistic, but overall the effect is quite good.  With the exception of a few UNIT soldiers, each person's motivations are carefully considered.  Back-stories are worked into the narrative with meticulous detail making even soon-to-be-brutally-killed characters seem interesting.  The plot is a little thin and there is an awful lot of diversionary material present.  Fortunately, while the padding may be thick in places it's all padding of the highest quality.<br />As I mentioned there are a few new-author problems with the book.  One of the more irritating aspects of the story was the &quot;information dump&quot; that kept cropping up.  Upon encountering someone who had not been present for a sequence, a character would be quickly brought up to date with what was going on.  This was usually handled in the clumsy, &quot;X quickly told Y about their adventures while Y looked incredulous&quot; manner that got a little irritating after the fourth or fifth repetition.  There are better ways of structuring novels to avoid this sort of thing, and at these moments I was reminded of the old Target novelisations.  Still, this is a just a minor concern and something that will surely disappear after Walters gains more experience as a writer.<br />As for the regulars, the characterization of the Doctor is something that I found to be something of a mystery here.  He's much edgier here, bringing out the rougher, harsher aspects of Paul McGann's TVM portrayal, yet he stands by the wayside here and gets almost nothing done.  On the companion side of things, Fitz gets most of the face-time and Sam is sidelined for the majority of the book; these two things are definitely a positive development.<br />All in all, this was a good read despite the minor quibbles that I mentioned here.  Recommended.	2001-07-09
US	50631983	R13VHO7QFVPYXM	056355570X	216132053	Revolution Man (Doctor Who Series)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The potential was there	The cover of REVOLUTION MAN is gorgeous, simply marvelous.  It's almost worth picking up the book just for the cover-art; digital reproduction just doesn't do justice to the colours.  Fortunately, the book itself is also worth owning for the stuff printed on the inside, despite a number of near-fatal flaws that detract from the main feature.<br />The regulars are handled adequately here, with special credit going to Paul Leonard's treatment of Sam.  When I read that Sam Jones was going to be spending time hanging out with sixties radicals I experienced a sick feeling in my stomach.  A lesser author might have brought the worst of Sam's qualities to the foreground, having her deliver an infinite number of speeches on how backwards and out-of-touch that decade was from her oh-so-enlightened point of view.  However, Leonard manages to give us an insight into Sam's thought processes without allowing them to come across as overbearing and arrogant.  He did go a little overboard in describing her reaction to the sexism inherent to the sixties, but then anything less would be out of character.<br />Fitz on the other hand seems much weaker than in previous stories.  Granted, he hasn't been shown as the most aggressive of companions, but he manages to go from completely normal to utterly brainwashed by a totalitarian government back to being (almost) himself again within forty pages.  Within the structure of the book, the brainwashing procedure lasts for about a year (none of which we witness) and appears to be totally successful, yet it takes much less than a day for it to all work out of his system.  This could have been handled in a much more interesting way, yet the rushed ending (which I shall discuss in a moment) to the book and to this section are very frustrating.  We don't experience any of the reaction to his entire world-view being shattered twice within a relatively short amount of time.  It just seems like a quick plot device that should have been either furtherdeveloped or just dropped completely.<br />Plot-wise this book is a real page-turner for its initial two-thirds.  There's a powerful drug that is being used by different military and civilian factions, most attempting to harness its energy for their own irresponsible deeds.  The Doctor must attempt to defuse the situation and restore the status quo.  Unfortunately this book suffers from the lack of a proper resolution to several fundamental plot-threats.  By the end we haven't been told where the mysterious drugs have come from, or what damage has been done to the time-line.  It is implied that these events have only been set in motion because of some outside, unseen, time-sensitive force, but apart from the mention at the beginning, these are completely ignored.  These may be addressed in future &quot;arc&quot; books, but as I have been avoiding spoilers, I have no way of knowing.  It certainly doesn't excuse the lack of acknowledgement of these problems within the narrative of this particular story though.  This is a shame, because as I noted, the opening and middle sections of this book are fabulous.<br />The very ending of the book has been surrounded in controversy and I'll attempt to discuss this without the need for any spoiler warnings.  In short, the Doctor is quickly forced to do something that seems quite shocking.  While it may be bordering on being out of character for the Doctor to do this, I think that the situation he had been placed into required his acting in the manner in which he did.  I do not think this would be a big problem if only the book had not ended so abruptly just after this point.  Leonard seemed to be deliberately manipulating the situation so that the Doctor is forced to act in the way that he does.  In fact, several events occur purely to bring him to that point.  And I have to say that the situation that the Doctor is placed into is an interesting one, worthy of more attention.  It appears as though Leonard deliberately put the Doctor into the situation that he wanted to, which forced him to act in a certain way, but then forgot to put in the big payoff at the end.  As it stands now, the narrative seems incomplete, as if it is relying on the following book to clean up the mess that's been left behind.  We only get a few sentences from the Doctor saying he's upset and a few passages from Sam relaying the same information to Fitz.  What we don't see is how this has affected the crew.  While this may or may not lead to great and wonderful writing in the next part of the series, it does detract from the enjoyment that one takes out of this particular volume.  An extra thirty pages at the end that dealt with the reaction would have done a lot to put these concerns to rest.<br />All in all, if more care had been taken to the conclusion of this story, I would probably have a higher opinion of it.  It certainly is not a poor book and I quite enjoyed reading it, but the flaws that I have pointed out negatively affected my enjoyment of the novel.	2001-07-06
US	50631983	R6HJVYVZ9ZTCL	0563555726	192244908	Demontage (Doctor Who Series)	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Not bad, but dull	I can't point to any part of DEMONTAGE and declare that this is the moment in which the author made the massive mistake that tainted the book.  Neither can I reveal any portion of the story that is unbelievably wonderful and demands that this be named the greatest Doctor Who story of all time.  The book ends up being somewhere in the banal center of these two extremes, being more boring than breathtaking.<br />On the plus side, the addition of Fitz to the TARDIS crew is definitely paying off.  Even the Doctor seems to be reacting well to the change in lineup, verbally bouncing off of and teasing Fitz in a way that simply wouldn't work with Sam.  And the added bonus is that with two companions, there is less space that can be devoted to Sam.  This can only be a good thing.<br />The high number of secondary characters in the book means that there is a certain diluting effect -- most of them have hardly any depth at all.  Instead of two or three characters getting the lion's share of the action, the roles are spread uniformly thin.  So rather than getting a small number of well-developed characters, we get a large number of people who have names, short character descriptions and very little else.  I kept trying to keep the two antique dealers separated in my mind until about half way through when I just gave up.  I'm not sure if the attempt was to make a Robert Holmes type double-team of humourous villains, but the result was to end up with the same character given two names.  The same also goes for the art exhibition curator and her financial partner; two characters who for all intents and purposes could have been filled by the role of one.<br />The plot is undemanding and the comparisons to THE NIGHTMARE OF EDEN are all quite valid and don't need to be repeated here.  There are some portions here and there where one can feel the story creeping up to the side of intrigue and interest, but right at the last moment it turns back to the banality.  The revelation about how the creatures are manifesting themselves would be icing on the cake of a more engrossing story, but without anything else supporting it, it just seems to fall flat.  The details concerning this revelation are also a bit confused towards the end and I don't believe that the connection between the creatures and their manifestation was explained coherently.<br />In any case, this isn't a terribly bad story and neither is it especially good.  There are a few highlights but overall it's fairly forgettable.	2001-07-05
US	50631983	R1SJHXCOTVT84M	0563555688	10325610	Doctor Who and the Taint (Doctor Who Series)	Books	3	0	0	N	Y	Not great, not horrible	The pacing in THE TAINT is so much more even than in THE LONGEST DAY that it is difficult to believe that they were written by the same author.  Where Michael Collier's debut novel had plodding sequences that stretched on and on into nothingness, his follow-up consists of many short and snappy scenes, each giving way to the next before they outstay their welcomeness.  Unfortunately, while the story may flow better, we find that the plot contained within isn't all that much more interesting.<br />It should be no surprise to anyone that this story introduces a new companion to the Doctor's traveling crew.  Throughout the entire book Fitz Kreiner is a breath of fresh air, not only for a relatively lackluster story, but also for a book series that was in danger of stalling on account of its two fairly unappealing central characters.  He seems real and human in a way that the alien Doctor can't be and the no-dimensional Sam isn't.<br />The storyline is not terribly complicated.  There's a spooky, old house inhabited by several mental patients who all believe that they are being possessed by the devil.  There's a meddling psychiatrist who wishes to discover the common characteristic that binds them all together.  Into this mix lands the Doctor who, of course, manages to get himself entangled in the situation almost immediately and discovers that the patients aren't actually being controlled by Satan (though we never really expected that they would be), but are in fact an off-shoot of an alien engaged in a war against a long-forgotten enemy.  The story isn't terribly bad, nor is it overly engaging.  In a similarity to ALIEN BODIES, each of the patients have part of their past story told in their own separate flashback chapter.  These sections are by far the most interesting portions of the story.  We are shown how their disability has affected them throughout their existence.  It's very appealing writing and it's miles better than rest of the stuff in between.  Unfortunately, very little of this wonderful character development makes its way back from the flashbacks into the main portion of the story.  The individuals of the flashbacks are people with fears, insecurities, pains and stories.  The patients of the main story are bland, faceless and easy for the reader to confuse.<br />Although I've spent most of the space here complaining about the books faults, I will be looking forward to Collier's next book.  There aren't any major flaws present and it is a definite improvement over his previous work.  If his next offering is as improved, then it should certainly be worth reading.	2001-07-02
US	50631983	R2DG0LMZM2UNQV	0563555696	327686251	The Face-Eater (Doctor Who Series)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Page-Turner	THE FACE-EATER is not terribly original or innovative and does not take the reader anywhere that Doctor Who hasn't (metaphorically) gone before.  It doesn't blaze any new trails like ALIEN BODIES, it doesn't redefine a companion like SEEING I, nor does it push the envelope towards a beautiful breaking-point in the way that THE SCARLET EMPRESS did.  It is, however, mesmerizing and spellbinding, and I sped through this in about half the time it usually takes me to read a BBC Doctor Who book because I simply couldn't put the book down.  <br />The plot skips along quickly and isn't overly complicated while not being totally straightforward either.  This is actually used to great effect by Simon Messingham.  When the action slows down, interesting character development takes place as well as some fascinating reflections on the setting.  In case you didn't know, this book is set on the planet that is the home to the first Earth colony outside the solar system.  There are some excellent passages concerning how isolated these people are, how much they sacrificed to come this far and just what exactly is at stake in this situation.<br />The Doctor is relegated to the sidelines through most of the story, though for the small amount of time that he is present he has some appropriate lines and great scenes.  There are some good moments for him here, the best being when he is tied to a chair and literally spends hours trying to convince his captor that he isn't a shape-shifter.  The premise is simple enough, but the scene is wonderfully written and shows that Messingham really has the hang of this Doctor in a way that very few other EDA authors have demonstrated.<br />Sam, on the other hand, for the first portion of the book, is at her most annoying - worse than she's ever been.  She whines, she moans and she complains.  She's mean and she's witlessly sarcastic to people who she has no reason to be mean and witlessly sarcastic to.  In short, it's everything we've come to know and loathe about her since she joined the Doctor.  Fortunately, she tones it down in the middle and end of the book so that she actually becomes somewhat tolerable.  I suspect that Messingham wanted to make her over-the-top in her assertiveness to compensate for the events of the previous book but was forced by reason of her love interest in this story to mellow her out a little.  It would be far beyond the realms of possibility to believe that anyone could gain an admirer if he or she was continually carrying on in the manner Sam was at the start of this book.<br />Fortunately, what saves the opening of the book from being a complete Sam-infested failure is the great mystery that Messingham has set up.  There's a suspected psychopath on the loose and people are mysteriously being killed.  They're all fairly standard Doctor Who elements, but the execution is so superb that it all feels very fresh and new.<br />One of the highlights for me was watching the commander of the colony going slowly insane as the story progresses.  From the very start she's nervous and unsure of her command.  There is a conspiracy, she is convinced, that is intent on usurping her authority and destroying the civilization that she has worked so hard to build.  Her paranoia gains more control of her mind and eventually she is reduced to setting up trip wires around her office with pieces of string tied around containers of pens in an attempt to find a fictitious intruder (who she imagines is a disgruntled worker out to sabotage her colony and can be identified by wearing, appropriately, a red arm band).  The slow progression from slightly neurotic leader to full-blown lunatic is well handled and intriguing.  Excellent, well-written stuff.<br />This is definitely a good book and comes highly recommended despite the painful Sam moments at the beginning.  It's not earth-shattering or groundbreaking, but it accomplishes what it set out to do and that is to tell a wildly entertaining story.	2001-06-28
US	50631983	R1VDX2JZVKUTXM	0563405937	93857643	Beltempest (Doctor Who Series)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Great story mostly, but where's the end?	This book consists of two main sections separated by a short interlude.  The first part is one hundred and eighty pages long and the second part is fifty-nine pages long.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to notice that the last section is quite a bit shorter than the first, and this is what kills the story dead.  The shorter section is just as important to the story (indeed, it's where most of the major developments occur) but things are skipped over at a ludicrous rate.  This culminates at the conclusion where we go from the potential destruction of an entire solar system to the resolution of the story inside two pages without any explanation.  We aren't told anything about how the regulars escaped certain death, what the eventual fate of the star system and it's billions of inhabitants are, whether the aliens survived and just what on earth happened to Sam.<br />This was an extremely frustrating conclusion to the story, as I had been greatly enjoying the first two hundred or so pages.  There are some fascinating discussions on religion and the power of a leader.  Never do these become overbearing or tiresome.  In fact, they were by far my favourite parts of the beginning and middle of the book.  I grew impatient during the Doctor sections and the long explanations of the Beltempest star life cycles and wanted to get back to the sections I was enjoying.  That said, I thought the Doctor got a very good showing in this book.  While he's not given a lot to do, he handles his role with a lot of humour and charm.  Jim Mortimer manages to give the Doctor the innocence that we've seen in VAMPIRE SCIENCE and SEEING I without falling into the trap of &quot;the Doctor as a congenial idiot&quot;.<br />This book could really have benefited from a stricter editor.  The prose was quite literally all over the place; in some places it's utilitarian, in others it tries to be poetical and in others it's incomprehensible.  It's as if Mortimer was having major mood swings while writing this and let whatever whim he was experiencing at the moment dictate the tone of the prose he was currently creating.  This would not necessarily be a bad thing, except that it leads to a few areas of incoherence where the reader is left unsure of what actually happened.  And I'm not speaking about the author being deliberately ambiguous, I'm talking about confusion over how characters got to certain places, why people were trusting the Doctor without question, where some characters had been inserted into the narrative, etc.  I don't mind having to piece together things without help from the author, but I am annoyed when people start following the Doctor around when they actually have more of a reason to stay where they are.  Characters and character motivation are not something that feature heavily in this book.<br />The story contains the same faults as the prose.  At times it's brilliant and at other times (such as the aforementioned non-ending) it's missing.  I can just imagine in the future an editor standing over Mortimer demanding that he finish writing the chapters he's doing before moving on to the next good idea.  &quot;No, Jim, this is a great idea and you already have the first seventy-five percent of it finished.  All you have to do is to finish writing the ending and it will be brilliant.&quot;<br />To sum it up, this is a very good book that's let down by some very big flaws.  It's odd that a story that feels so rushed is actually about thirty or forty pages shorter than the Doctor Who range average.  If Mortimer had taken the time to flesh out some of the good ideas that were present here (and bothered to write an ending), I think BELTEMPEST would stand to be one of the all-time best Doctor Who books.  As it exists now, it's a bit of an oddity.	2001-06-22
US	50631983	R7IBIED0FCO1R	0563405996	218366294	The Janus Conjunction (Doctor Who Series)	Books	2	2	2	N	N	A rehash.	THE JANUS CONJUNCTION is a book that doesn't know where it wants to go and never really gets there.  The story borrows very heavily from certain Jon Pertwee adventures and does not end up escaping.  This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but there isn't a point in the story where I found something that I hadn't seen before.  Everything felt as though I'd seen or read it a few times previously.  The real shame of this is that it disguises some of the actual original pieces in it.<br />As for the plot, I'm afraid there are just one too many impossibilities for me.  I don't mind a little bad science every now and again if it isn't distracting and it helps move the plot along.  Minor errors that crop up are usually more annoying than anything else, but in this case they really got in the way of my enjoyment of the story.  If there had been more to the plot, then it might have just gotten away with this, but as the story was so straightforward (and, frankly, dull in many places) the science mistakes became that much more apparent.  I was actually not terribly bothered by these errors until almost the very end, when a huge deux ex machina pops up, destroying all manner of physical laws, just in time to save the day.<br />Another major problem that I had with this book was the use of Sam, though to be fair to Trevor Baxendale, this is not completely the author's fault.  Sam is a very annoying character and there just isn't a terribly satisfactory way of putting her into a story without the reader wishing that she doesn't end up dying after her Torture of the Month.  SEEING I got away with using Sam well by having her grow up and putting some of her more annoying characteristics into perspective.  VANDERDEKEN'S CHILDREN starred a generic companion who just happened to be named Sam and shared very few of her positive and negative points.  But JANUS just shows us Sam in all her annoying, holier-than-thou glory.  The results are very painful in places.  While some authors have gone to great lengths to keep her out of situations that will bring out the worst in her character, Baxendale does not do this.  It's hardly his fault that he was stuck with a companion that has to be tiptoed around, but the story he has written really clashes with the Sam that he had to use.<br />The other characters (including the Doctor) are fairly bland.  If you've ever seen a Pertwee episode then you've met these people before.  We have the 70's era environmentally friendly colonists that are looking for a nice place to live away from the hustle and bustle of Earth.  They're lead by the council of elders who are slow, bureaucratic and don't listen to the Doctor until it's too late no matter how much sense it would make to do so.  The bad guys are a group of mercenaries who are evil, greedy and are only in it for the money and the glory.  The exceptions are the soldiers who end up siding with the colonists by the end of the book, which, again, is a plot point that we've seen again and again.<br />In any case, JANUS is a run of the mill adventure that's let down heavily by it's reliance on very poor science and some rather cardboard characterizations.  It's a very fast read, but there is not a whole lot there to recommend it.	2001-06-14

It's Doctor Who because it's completely unlike anything that Doctor Who has ever done before.  Better than that, it's good Doctor Who because it doesn't just stop at pushing the multi-faceted envelope; it's entertaining and interesting at the same time.  It even stops at a few points for some interesting self-aware passages that offer some thoughts on the nature of story-telling that were well-written enough to stop just before they became too pretentious.<br />It's a very complicated book, with many jumps in the narrative from different viewpoints, sometimes several within the same page.  This can be a little difficult at times, but it's very rewarding overall.  The perspectives from different characters and cultures are very rich and detailed, and all of them are treated with a good degree of respect.<br />There are one or two weak points.  At some places, the plot almost disappears and these sections tend to drag a bit.  There are other spots where the suspension of disbelief that was required was just a more than what I was willing to give.  I can forgive one or two little coincidences, but there are some in here that are just so great that I felt they hurt the overall quality of the book.<br />On the whole, this is one of the best EDAs that I have read and is well worth a second read.	2001-06-12
US	50631983	R37KCA3KJM3JER	0563405902	25747396	Vanderdeken's Children (Doctor Who Series)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Great plot makes up for the shallow characters	VANDERDEKEN'S CHILDREN comes as a refreshing breath of air after the last few books that have been sacrificing plot for characterization (or just plain sacrificing both for nothing).  Don't get me wrong now, I'd prefer to have both in a story, but if we're only going to get one at a time in this series, it is nice to mix them up every now and then.<br />This is the hardest Science-Fiction story that the Doctor Who series has had in a while.  Derelict spacecrafts, time paradoxes, hyperspace tunnels, and echoes from the future all feature heavily.  The Doctor and Sam get to play Sherlock Holmes and Watson while helping two different human factions uncover the mystery of an abandoned alien ship that's apparently home to some familiar ghosts.  The plot is genuinely interesting and I was kept on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it would unfold.<br />The characterization is uniformly shallow with one or two sections where it descends into tedium.  I couldn't see how the subplot concerning the husband, wife and the other woman made any difference to the story.  I realize that they were also experiencing the same sort of future echoes that the rest of the passengers were and I thought it was a good idea to show some of the other effects of the time loop.  But while it made for a diversion from the main action, it was not an interesting one, and in my opinion it should have either been strengthened or cut from the book entirely.  Every time that section came up, I inwardly groaned at the clichéd dialogue and the stereotypical &quot;tough wife and passive husband&quot; relationship.<br />But as this was mainly a plot driven story, the characterization didn't distract from it all that much.  There are a few places at the end where the explanation about the future time lines seemed to fall apart.  I was especially annoyed at the eventual explanation for what the origin of the ship was.  However, overall this was a very good book and I highly recommend it for fans of thebook series or for people who are unfamiliar to the Doctor Who format.  The book seems specially designed for beginners to the line and starts off with a short and unobtrusive introduction to the main characters, the TARDIS and the series particulars.	2001-06-04

Putting this book inside the Sam Is Missing arc was probably a very bad idea. While most of this story is rather enjoyable, the ending really suffers because of the lack of a resolution. Not only do the Doctor and Sam fail to meet up again, but the story itself just sputters out without a satisfactory conclusion. Both of these elements seem to highlight the other, making the ending of the book a huge disappointment. Obviously I realize that since this is the middle part of a multi-book series, there isn't going to be a ultimate conclusion to all of the threads, but to leave so many of them hanging (including pieces from the story itself) really leaves the reader feeling unsatisfied.<br />On the other hand, the parts leading up to the (lack of) ending are quite interesting. The story moves quickly enough so that we never grow bored with any of it and the revelations come quickly enough so that one doesn't have to time to think about them too much. The characters painted are quite interesting as we get to know them, though there are some annoying passages in which Sam gets teamed up with a substitute Doctor and the Doctor gets paired up with a replacement companion. Though the surrogates are interesting characters in their own rights, they share too many of the qualities of the missing half and it ends up feeling a bit contrived.<br />The plot centers on a substance called dreamstone, which is used by humans to record and play back dreams. This subject has been done a few times before in science fiction, yet Leonard manages to keep things fresh here. He never goes into a great amount of detail concerning the specifics of what dreamstone is, and this allows the plot to stay on track without getting bogged down with boring technobabble.<br />All in all this is an entertaining, if light, read. This book is quite a bit shorter than the BBC book average, so it won't take the reader very long to get through. While this may help the beginning and middle sections, it probablyends up accenting the unsatisfactory nature of the ending.	2001-05-31
US	50631983	R397146NIJDKDJ	0563405872	428485607	Placebo Effect (Doctor Who Series)	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Could have been really good, but falls flat	In my review for SEEING I, I stated that I was happy at the increase in quality and that I was left wanting to read more in the series like it.  As the book immediately following, PLACEBO EFFECT was not exactly what I had in mind.  Don't get me wrong now, I did not think that this was a particularly horrible book - just an average one that's let down by one or two poorly thought out parts.<br />As is revealed in the introduction to the book, this is the long-awaited story that features the return of not one but two old Doctor Who villains.  Perhaps &quot;long-awaited&quot; is not quite the correct way to phrase the return of the Wirrrn (Gary Russell insists on using the novelisation spelling) and the Foamasi, but I was quite curious to see how they would turn out.  To my great surprise, I found myself quite enjoying them in this setting.  As the book is set during the Olympics in the year 3999, I was half-hoping that we would be treated to the sight of the Foamasi running around in track-suits getting ready to compete in the 100m hurdles.  Alas this was not the case.<br />The majority of the book plows ahead confidently, never being too flashy or too hideous.  However, there are one or two points where the book skids to a complete halt leaving the reader to wonder just what was going on.  The most glaring example of this is an evolution versus creationist argument that suddenly comes from nowhere to blind-side the reader.  I'm really not sure what the point of including this was.  The background of everyone involved in the debate had already been explained and gone over repeatedly, so there wasn't anything new revealed with that.  The religious overtones have already been set up, so we're just getting more repetition rather than further insight.  And worst of all is that the argument itself relies on the fact that neither side knows very much about the other's viewpoint, or even about the details of their own.  So we're just left with a rather superficial and sillyargument about evolution that adds nothing and goes nowhere.  I doubt that the intention was to show both sides as shallow, yet that's exactly the impression that one is left with.  This really should have been cut from the book.<br />In the previous book, Sam spent most of her three-year separation from the Doctor growing up and learning about the universe and herself.  Unfortunately, very little of her maturing seems to have stuck with her, as for the majority of it she seems to be more of a generic companion than the Sam who left in the TARDIS in SEEING I.  There are one or two places where the new Sam can be recognized, but for a majority of the story this is not the case.  This is a real shame, as the Sam that rejoined the Doctor in the previous story was well on the way to becoming an interesting character that was more than just a few cheesy catch-phrases.<br />The descriptions of the Wirrrn taking over peoples of different species are far and away the best part of this book.  The Wirrrn and their human agent are genuinely frightening, taking the best elements from the series and bringing them to life again.  Unfortunately they hardly appear in the story at all, often disappearing for chapters at a time.  The book would have been far better with more of these passages and it's rather telling that the Doctor doesn't even know about the Wirrrn's presence until thirty pages from the very end of the book.  The conclusion to the Wirrrn section of the book (which one assumes is the main plot) is therefore rushed though and ultimately feels very unsatisfying.  One wishes that Russell had taken more time in crafting this portion of the book, as there was a lot of wasted potential here.<br />Overall, this is a fairly flawed work that's enjoyable in some places and tedious in others.  A lot of the right elements are there for this to be a far better book that it is.  With some generous editing and more effort, this could have been a really good story.	2001-05-25
US	50631983	RKIL67YNB6QV0	0563405864	482641523	Seeing I (Doctor Who Series)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	A great return to form for the BBC Doctor Who books	There was one moment while in SEEING I where I cheered out loud.  It was the passage in which Sam Jones (having run out on the Doctor in an earlier book) gets fed up with her boring, routine, desk-bound, nine-to-five job and quits to try to make a life for herself that means something.  And this portion demonstrates the strength of this book.  No longer is Sam merely Generic Companion #1, but a thinking, living, human character who's forced to deal with life after her first series of travels in the TARDIS.<br />The Doctor is well characterized here, but that isn't surprising as Kate Orman and Jon Blum are the team that gave us the first real characterization of the post-TV-Movie Eighth Doctor.  There are a few places where his extreme touch-feeliness may feel a bit shallow and false, but there is something positive to be said about a Doctor who goes bungee jumping in between adventures.  The plot is fairly thin and serves mostly to explore the two main characters, Sam and the Eighth Doctor, and their relationship -- something that had not been done as well or as in-depth in this BBC range  it had been in some of the Doctor/companion teams of the Virgin-era books.  This is something that the series was very much in need of -- in prior books, the Doctor and Sam had become almost faceless, with Paul McGann's one-time portrayal of the Doctor being reduced into small basic mannerisms that captured none of the charm and enthusiasm that had been brought to the role.  SEEING I did a wonderful job of giving the Doctor more character than simply repeating his friends' a (not inconsiderable) number of times before addressing them.<br />All in all, this is an excellent return to form.  With far too many of the early BBC books reading like simple churned-out children's books, it's nice to have something that appears to have been thought all the way through.  We have an interesting villain in the form of the I, who could have done with a little more face-time.  We get to learn abit more about Sam and we see the authors handle her in a way that doesn't make her seem like the most annoying companion that ever existed.  We get a good solid adventure story, and like all of Kate Orman's books, we get to see the Doctor actually going through some suffering during his trials and tribulations.  SEEING I definitely left me wanting more.	2001-05-21

There's nothing there to hold the reader's interest through to the end.  The plot is about average with one or two bright spots here and there, but any ground made up is swamped by the poor execution.<br />Pacing, or the lack thereof, is probably the book's worst sin.  No tension or excitement is built, things just sort of happen without any rhyme or reason until the end when they just sort of stop happening.  The characterization is fairly decent, but the alien names are so confusing and interchangeable, that I reached a point where I stop bothering about trying to keep the characters in mind and just started winging it.  This didn't seem to make much of a difference.<br />The bottom line is that it took me almost three times as long to plow through LONGEST DAY than it has for any other BBC Doctor Who book.  It's a long, drawn-out story punctuated by occasional violence (which I didn't find as intrusive or as sickening as other people apparently did).  There are some nice touches (such as the Doctor zooming through the corridors of an alien dome in his purple VW Beetle), but the book makes the reader work so hard to get to them that it really isn't worth the effort.	2001-05-18

It's funny, yet sad, and quick, but deep.  It's a fast read, but it will stick with you for a very long time.  The protagonist bounces around in time and space and the book follows his confusion as he passively progresses through the story.  Time has no meaning, and even when he hasn't been traveling, the days march on without any regard to Billy. <br />Billy Pilgrim is an observer to everything going on around him.  He has no control over the war, he has no control over the zoo he's put in, and he has no control over his own life (he only remembers proposing to his wife in a fit of pseudo-madness).  He has no power and no sense of self.  He follows along to what others do to him, or simply obeys the orders of those around him.  He's become as desensitized to life as he has to death.  Every death is closed with a simple &quot;So it goes&quot; and every living person is simply talked about, not interacted with.  There's no passion, no anger and no other emotions in his existence.  He simply reports what he observes and waits around to see what will happen to him next.<br />This book is definitely worth reading.  Ride along with Billy on his insane voyage through time and space.  See if you can discover which is more mad - strange space aliens that kidnap people for their interplanetary zoo, or the human fire-bombings of Dresden and the concentration camps of the Second World War.	2001-05-14
US	50631983	R1MA2DGX9F8B9H	0563405775	73444925	Doctor Who: Alien Bodies	Books	3	5	7	N	Y	All dressed up with no place to go	ALIEN BODIES is probably one of the most frustrating Doctor Who books I've read in a long time.  Frustrating because it contains some of the best concepts and ideas that the Doctor Who line has had in years, yet utterly fails to do anything remotely interesting with them.  It feels as though much more thought went into coming up with these great concepts than into sitting down and thinking about how these wonderful ideas would make a worthwhile book.<br />The plot is almost non-existent, as virtually the entire book seems to be the set-up to something that never happens.  Far too much of the main action happens off-screen in the distant future, so it's hard to feel any real emotion for it.  The ending is especially annoying with the Doctor able to hop back and forth between reality and the Celestis plane of existence with ease despite not having heard about them before and knowing next to nothing about them.  It feels like a complete cop-out.<br />I felt that the characterization of the main characters was also rather poor.  Homunculette in particular seemed to be a one-note person and the fact that he was in so much of the book really turned me off of it.  I got rather annoyed that every time he showed up he was shouting and screaming.  Roaring for almost an entire book and then crying for one scene does not an interesting character make.  The Shift (a creature made up of purely mental energy) almost made up for this, although a good concept and great execution does not necessarily make for a good character.<br />I'll go over some of the good ideas and how I thought they failed to make good on their potential.  Faction Paradox - great idea and questions the fundamental aspects of time travel which is something that has never really been done in quite this way in the series' history.  The Celestis - again, a wonderful idea that takes something we've seen before and puts a new twist to it.  Dark Sam - almost anything would improve the regular Sam, but this is actually something intriguing.  The future war and the enemy - good ideas that lay the seeds for the future.  Unfortunately, that last sentence seems to sum up all of the elements in the book.  It's so concerned about making the future a more interesting place that it forgets about the present.  We are told about Faction Paradox's great powers and plans, but apart from a bit of voodoo and a spooky TARDIS we don't actually witness anything.  The same goes for the future war and the enemy, and this is based on the fact that the Doctor can't know too much about events that have yet to happen in his personal time-line.  The problem that results is that everything has to be taken on faith.  The reader has to assume that Faction Paradox can do what's said of them, just as the reader has to assume that the future war is as important as it's said to be.  And that's where the real problem lies; with so much of the story either happening off-screen or just being told and not shown, the whole thing ends up feeling hollow and unreal.<br />So, at the end of the day, we're left with a book that's bursting with good ideas, but that doesn't have any real way of tying them together.  It's more of a checklist of concepts than a book in it's own right.  Maybe this was written as a teaser for better things to come, but the story just didn't work for me.	2001-05-11
US	50631983	R2WANJ1LKVCZOY	056340583X	428850656	Option Lock (Dr. Who Series)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Solid adventure without many frills	OPTION LOCK is a very visual book, perhaps one of the most visual Doctor Who books I've ever read.  This means that there's a lot of dialogue, a lot of action and not a lot in the way of character introspection.  We get a lot of information about what things physically look like, where they are in relation to each other and comparisons to other objects.  The locations are vast and sprawling.  We have a large James Bond type control room with giant view screens and computers with blinking lights.  It comes complete with it's own Bondian villain with a silly twitch under his eye.<br />This visual flavour makes the story feel more like the book version of a multi-million-dollar film that's already been shot rather than an adventure that's written specifically for the book format.  However, this is not necessarily a bad thing at times and to the author's credit, it's done very well here.  The visual nature of the prose leaves the reader with several of the pivotal scenes etched into the mind.  It has a very large and cinematic feel to it that can be quite enjoyable if one is in the mood for that.  The plot is not actually overly complicated, yet the action moves forward fast enough to keep things enjoyable.<br />In short, this is a fairly good, fast-paced, solid action-adventure.  It's quite entertaining and if you're looking for something that's light but not at all bad, this is probably one of the early BBC books that you should look into.	2001-05-07

The characters in this book are amazingly true to life and very believable.  Each viewpoint expressed has its own merits and its own drawbacks, but each side is treated with a certain amount of respect.  In far too many other books, the author's own philosophies will get in the way of the story and skew it in such a manner that one argument gets though virtually unscathed, while the other one ends up looking remarkably shaky.  The person with the &quot;correct&quot; ideas is shown to be thoughtful and wise while the other ends up looking like a close-minded jerk.  Here, however, J. D. Salinger was able to show both sides, warts and all, while letting both Franny and Zooey's viewpoint remain intact and stay true to their character.  The discussion they have is quite realistic and touches on real subjects - taking the higher and nobler aspects of religious and theology and bringing them into one's everyday life is something that a lot of people have thought about but not everyone has done.<br />I highly recommend these two stories.  They're real and they're believable.	2001-04-30
US	50631983	R201Z2ZRZIC6OR	0061093297	527532142	Star Trek Movie Memories	Books	3	23	24	N	N	Surprisingly good...	I saw this book in the bargain bin at the local Borders bookstore and being a fan of the original Star Trek movies, I couldn't resist it.  Would this be a huge ego-trip recounting (and inventing) all of William Shatner's triumphs at the expense of his cast-mates?  Would he spend too much time talking about his own brilliance instead of the input of the writers and directors?  Would I hurl the book against the wall in disgust, vowing never to read another Star Trek autobiography again?  Surprisingly, the answer to all of these questions was &quot;no&quot;.<br />From his reputation I never thought I would say this, but Shatner really does not talk about himself enough in this book.  I'll wait a moment while you digest this fact.  The bulk of the book is spent describing the relationship between the writers and the directors, the producers and the writers, the producers and the directors, the producers and the studio, the writers and the studio, and everyone and Gene Roddenberry.  Since Shatner was never involved in any of these early negotiations (with the exception of Star Trek 5) quite a lot of the story is told by large quotations of the people involved.  This leads to a somewhat balanced, though occasionally dry, representation of all that goes on behind the scenes of a multi-million dollar movie franchise.  Fortunately the stories of the back-stabbing and double-dealing are wildly entertaining in their own right, so the book doesn't suffer much as a result of this.<br />There aren't a lot of amusing or entertaining anecdotes here nor is there much of anything resembling personal remembrances.  At times, one has to stop and remember that this was actually written by someone who was part of the cast and not some random Trek fan doing research and interviews.  There are some nice touches here and there, such as his description of trying to patch things up with James Doohan and Walter Koenig on the set of the Generations film, and discussing the patch of unemploymentthat he went through immediately after the cancellation of the Star Trek TV series.  The book would have been far better with more of these stories; however, it is an ultimately enjoyable read as it is.	2001-04-27

It takes almost two hundred pages before the HEART OF TARDIS becomes in any way enjoyable, but by that time the reader has to wonder why one even bothered.  HEART OF TARDIS is basically a story and its sequel squashed together inside one book for no real good reason.  It's bogged down by its own pomposity and collapses under its own weight.<br />I felt that Dave Stone's characterization of the two Doctors was just slightly off.  The second Doctor was somewhat too cartoonish for me, and the fourth just missed the mark of being Tom Baker type insanity and ended up being Dave Stone type insanity (which is a completely different style of madness, believe it or not).  On the other hand, Romana was spot-on, and I could exactly picture Mary Tamm's holier-than-thou attitude without it going too far over the top.  Victoria is also done quite well, and Stone does an excellent job of viewing the developing situation through the eyes of a 19th Century woman without descending into stereotypes and clichés.  His Jamie was perhaps not done so well, but Stone is smart enough to recognize this, and wisely keeps Jamie out of the main action.<br />For some reason the ending to this story feels extremely rushed which is odd because the first nine-tenths of the book seemed to be happening in slow motion.  One is waiting for something to happen for almost the full length of the book and then when something finally does occur, it's over before one has time to react.  I got the impression that the author had a really good idea for putting two different Doctors in the same book, but forgot what that was long before he reached the end.  The ending doesn't resolve, it just sort of hangs there, and the reader has to wonder what all this careful build-up was for.  Far too many things appear to be done completely at random and without any real thought behind them.  There is a difference between making something deliberately offbeat and twisted, and just doing random things at arbitrary intervals.  Instead of taking these strange elements and perhaps doing something original to them, they are quickly dropped and then replaced with something else so that nothing has time to develop into anything remarkable.  The result is a just a jumbled mess of half finished thoughts.<br />All in all, there are a few parts of the book that work fairly well, but they are very few and very far between.<br />(On a completely unrelated note, Stone really missed out on a lot of funny material by not taking advantage of the fact that he had a Baltimore native as one of his bad guys.  Lines such as, &quot;Tell us what we wanna know, hon, or we'll send you downyoshen&quot;, &quot;Hey, Brigadier, you wanna have a Colt '45 at the plant and then goh walk by da harrber?&quot;, &quot;We thought you'd died; died or gonna Catonsville&quot; and &quot;Wir gunna have to take over da world tamorroh, mah fellow Baltimorons, 'cause right now we're listenin' to Kirk, Mark and Lopez&quot; were conspicuous by their absence.)	2001-04-23

The first half of the book deals in larger chunks of time, but by the time the second half begins, each chapter encompasses a single day.  As in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN by the same authors, the reader may find the onslaught of different names to be intimidating; fortunately, the cast of characters list at the beginning of the book helps a lot.  All the people involved are treated with a lot of respect, and their motivations are made very clear throughout with only a few exceptions.<br />Unlike ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, this is not told from the viewpoint of the two authors.  Through interviews and other methods, the two journalists have reconstructed what they believe those last few months to have been like.  The result is an amazing and richly detailed look at the aftermath of one of the most important scandals in recent US history.<br />One of the real strengths of this book is that it allows the reader to see how the scandal affected many of the different people that were close to the President -- his aides, his family, the lawyers defending him, congressmen, fellow Republican leaders, etc.  We see how his team tried (and eventually failed) to fight the accusations made at President and how his staff continued to get the work done even as he retreated farther and farther into himself.<br />Before I read ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and THE FINAL DAYS, I really didn't know too many particulars about the whole Watergate scandal.  I highly recommend this pair of books to anyone looking for detailed, yet highly readable sources of information.	2001-04-19

Starting with some plays that he did as a school-boy, it continues right up to the year 2000 with his Comic Relief CURSE OF THE FATAL DEATH sketches and the BLACKADDER BACK AND FORTH one-off special.   Unfortunately, while the book is bursting at the seams with information and facts about his professional life, we never really learn much about Mr. Atkinson himself.  This is perhaps hardly surprising, after all it's fairly well-known that he hates to give interviews and will often times appear on a chat show in his Mr. Bean character in order to promote the series without having to give anything of himself away.  Throughout the book one only catches a glimpse of the man behind that face.  We learn rather superficial details, such as his love for automobiles and his shyness in person, but we never really get to see how much of an impact his public and private lives have on each other.<br />There has obviously been a lot of research that has gone into this book.  To compensate for the lack of material from the mouth of Rowan Atkinson himself, the author instead quotes from a variety of his friends, but the bulk of the information comes from his co-workers.  It's very interesting to see how Atkinson kept with the same people he had worked with since his graduate school days.  The same names keep cropping up over and over and it becomes clear that Atkinson knows to stick with a winning team.  One also learns the origin of some of the most famous Mr. Bean sketches, many of which date back to his stage persona from the late 1970s.  I was fascinated to see the evolution of the Bean character.  While many of his live shows incorporated a silent character, it wasn't until the 90s that he brought most of his most famous material to television.<br />This book is recommended for fans of Rowan Atkinson's work.Do not expect an in-depth look at his personal life, because until Atkinson starts giving more interviews or writes his autobiography, there simply won't be anything on the market resembling one.  However, as far as detailing his many accomplishments in the field of comedy, you won't get any better than this book.	2001-04-18

The first half of the book is excellent; we have an interesting plot, engaging prose and the discussion of some of the more interesting ethical aspects of time travel.  At about the two-thirds point the book starts to waver.  The plot starts to drag and repeat, characters begin to act irrationally and the tone becomes less coherent.  By the end of the book, we're left with several fractured pieces of what could have been a really great story, if only the author had continued all the way through.<br />GENOCIDE features the return of Jo Grant and (not having read any of the Past Doctor books featuring her) I was curious as to how this character would work A) in book-form and B) being about twenty years older than last seen.  I think the attempt to bring her back was ultimately a failure, as the role that she played in the story was not quite the character that we had come to know during the Pertwee years.  I understand that Jo had done a lot of growing up since leaving the Doctor (we get a quick summary when her character is introduced: she's now divorced and raising a child on her own) but most of the character development just didn't seem to work.  I suspect that this is what comes of trying to add depth to a character that has always been portrayed as a one-dimensional flake.  With other companions these developments could have made for quite a fascinating character study, but for Jo they just seem wildly out of place.  One suspects that perhaps this would have worked better with a Sarah or Tegan type of character, for whom character development wasn't a totally alien concept.<br />On the other hand, the plot is engaging for the most part and the book is a very entertaining read.  In the story, a parallel universe has sprung into being and is affecting the well-being of the original.  Only one time-stream can survive, though we know from the very beginning which one is going to continue.  I quite enjoyed the dynamics between the characters from different universes, particularly the interaction between Sam and Kitig and between Sam and Jo.  Sam's inability to choose which time-stream is the one worthy of existence comes across quite well as someone who is genuinely trying to consider all things when faced with such a huge decision.  This is perhaps where the ending of the book is hurt.  The confusion that Sam faces is dealt with far too dismissively at the end and the reader is left unsure what the full consequences are of the final actions.  Leonard was quite clever in having each time-stream represented by a single character (Jo for the original and Kitig for the alternative) and having them each arguing for their respective universes; Jo wants to get back to her child, while Kitig represents an entire race of peace-loving intellectuals.  Sam really does face a dilemma and having her bounced back and forth between the two representatives really helps to drive home the seriousness and the difficulty of her decision.<br />Despite the book's flaws, I recommend this for anyone looking for a good, quick read near the beginning of the BBC Books line.  The imperfections are more apparent here than in others because this book should have been a lot better.  All the right ingredients are there, and during the beginning and middle they really work well together.  But when the ending falls apart as this one did, it's hard not to have a slightly bad taste in one's mouth afterwards.	2001-04-16

The book is vaguely set up in chronological order starting from his childhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts and ending with his retirement from his position as Speaker of the House.  But Tip (one feels to be on a first-name basis after the familiar tone of the book) sprinkles many anecdotes and jokes throughout the text, giving it a conversational flavour instead of reading like a straight history.<br />O'Neill does not try to hide the fact that he is a Democrat and an extremely partisan one at that.  However, he does not let his philosophies blind him to what people really are.  He remembers the flaws that were present in some of his Democratic colleagues and speaks about the good qualities in the Republicans in Congress.  Partisanship never gets in the way of friendship and he recalls many stories of socializing with members of both parties after a day spent fighting legislative battles.<br />It's fascinating to read about (what is now) history through the eyes of someone who was witnessing first-hand so much of it.  An entire chapter is dedicated to the Watergate scandal of the Nixon years and we can see it unfolding as he saw it.  Nixon can be seen through the eyes of someone who was not a part of his close inner-circle, but who was closer than the general public.  He offers his thoughts on the pardon given by President Ford and his mixed feelings on the subject.<br />All the Presidents that he worked with are given a chapter of their own where O'Neill offers praise, criticism and a few humourous anecdotes.  As expected, fellow Bostonian Jack Kennedy receives the most attention, having one chapter dedicated to him and another to his family.  O'Neill describes a man who surrounded himself by a team of people that were the best in the business when it came to getting someone elected, but who really did not have the first clue in how to deal with legislators.<br />O'Neill describes many of the battles he had with Kennedy's successor, President Johnson, on the subject of Vietnam.  O'Neill broke from the President's position and was quite vocal in his condemnation of the war.  The deep division in the Congress and the conversations he had with the President are given a lot of attention.  O'Neill details how, while agreeing with the sentiments of the protestors, he felt that they were distracting from the message.  Every time someone would smash a window in anger during a gathering, instead of reports of general unrest, the story in the press would be that this was another action supported by Tip.<br />The last two presidents that Tip served with were the two in office during his tenure as Speaker of the House.  President Carter, the Democrat, and President Reagan, the Republican, are seen to Tip as being almost complete opposites.  Where every conversation O'Neill had with Carter demonstrated the President's obvious knowledge in on a given subject, virtually all Reagan had to talk about were old movies and baseball.  The main difference in their leadership styles, and what Tip found so frustrating, was the difference in which the two men viewed the Congress.  Carter took a much more passive role, not really understanding the way that Washington worked.  In contrast, Reagan would be constantly on the phone to the members of Congress, sweet-talking them into supporting his bills.<br />This was a very interesting read and I highly recommend it.  O'Neill himself comes across as a very warm and friendly person who, in all his years in government, never forgot where he came from.  His fights over various pieces of legislation down the years always came down to a simple desire to help the little guy.	2001-04-16

While reading, one wonders if this was not originally a &quot;Junior Doctor Who&quot; novel starring the Third Doctor with Jo and then quickly altered at the last moment to accommodate the Eighth Doctor and Sam.  It wasn't, of course, as it was the subject of many an argument between the author and fans on the rec.arts.drwho newsgroup for quite a long time before its publication.  The object of discussion was the infamous &quot;retcon&quot; that turned all of the post-Genesis stories on their heads.  It's this that the book is most infamous for and I'll speak more about this later, but I'd first like to talk about the rest of the book.<br />There are several ideas present in the book that could, if developed properly, have turned out very well.  It would have been interesting to see the Doctor coming to terms with having accidentally wiped out an entire planet with more than just a shrug of his shoulders and a mumbling of, &quot;Oh golly, I feel just awful about those guys.&quot;  The scenario in which the Thals wished to turn themselves into Dalek-like creatures in order to survive and defeat the Daleks should have been a lot more interesting than it in fact turned out to be.  The Doctor merely lectures the Thal leader for a few moments and then the whole matter is dropped from the book without any more expansion.  There are some moments of actual interesting interaction that had the potential to develop into intriguing character development.  Sam and a Thal war veteran discuss some of the aspects of a race totally dedicated to war with generations upon generations not knowing any other way of life.  But instead of the conversations actually going somewhere philosophical or thought provoking, they are resolved with hackneyed dialog and banal observations.  Every character is a two-dimensional cliché and each person can be entirely summed up in a word or a short phrase (&quot;greedy&quot;, &quot;dedicated, but questioning&quot;, &quot;creepy&quot;, etc.).  Even the Doctor is mostly faceless; the only way we know that it's the Eighth Doctor is that we don't go any more than three pages without being told how good-looking he is.  It was certainly a relief when Davros was revived and was one of the only characters not to continually notice how attractive the new Doctor is.<br />The rest of the book is mostly a confused mess.  For example, the water planet on the fringes of the Dalek Empire is given the same name as the world that the Doctor is supposed to have destroyed (the editor should have caught this one).  The book is so heavy in continuity references to previous Dalek adventures, that one almost needs some reference material in one hand while reading the book in the other in order to make sense of it.  While the continuity points may alienate casual and non-fans, the hardcore fans are most likely annoyed that so many of the points are incorrect.  The remains of the Dalek battlecruiser that was destroyed by the Hand of Omega near Earth in REMEMBRANCE OF THE DALEKS are found floating thousands of light-years away in a seldom visited area of space with no explanation.  REMEMBRANCE took place in 1963 (at least Peel didn't try to retcon away the year of the adventure), yet &quot;about thirty years&quot; later, Earth is supposed to have a giant space empire spanning a large portion of the galaxy.  And worst of all, the Daleks actually find the Doctor's TARDIS unlocked, with all of its time-travel capabilities and other secrets available and the most interesting thing they can do is to plant a bomb inside in hopes of killing the Doctor.<br />Now, onto the retcon.  The only question that I have is: why?  The story could have continued on perfectly well without it and would not have been bogged down for several pages while the Dalek Prime has to explain and re-explain the situation to a confused audience.  It isn't needed for the story and only succeeds in making the Doctor and Davros look like complete morons for not noticing that a very important base of operations is suddenly a few thousand light-years away from where they thought it was.  It really does not seem to have any reason to be in the book at all.  It certainly reads as though the retcon was thought up first and then the rest of the book was structured to make it seem plausible.  Even with all the thought that obviously went into devising this, it still does not adequately fit into the rest of the story.  The jump from action to long, tortured explanation back to action feels very jarring.<br />The last few chapters of the book are passable if only because at this point one knows to keep one's brain firmly in the locked &quot;off&quot; position.  This is not recommended for grown-ups.	2001-04-06
US	50631983	REV27D2I6C2P2	0671894412	221450502	All the President's Men	Books	4	17	21	N	N	Everyone should read this.	This now-famous book is one of those rare creatures - a real-life thriller that's actually interesting for the average person to read.  Starting with a simple break-in at the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate Hotel, two reporters from the Washington Post followed the trail of money and corruption back to its source.  If you haven't been living under a rock, you know exactly how this story turns out, but watching Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward track down the clues is quite interesting.<br />The flurry of different names and places can be intimidating, especially to the reader who does not have a lot of prior knowledge about the Watergate scandal.  One will probably find oneself frequently flipping to the convenient Cast Of Characters page at the beginning of the book.  Bernstein and Woodworth themselves are left rather faceless and I often found myself getting the two of them confused.  Their attempts to humanize themselves fall flat almost every time, but that's to be expected; they are reporters, not pulp fiction writers and this is not a made-up story.<br />This book is recommended for anyone and is quite a page-turner, even for someone with only a passing interest in politics and history.  For someone who enjoys mysterious and thrillers, there's nothing better than a good story from real-life.  Everyone should read this book, if only for the historical impact that it has had on presidential politics.	2001-04-05

US	50631983	R147UQ83YVHLCQ	0679437223	458864358	Catch-22 (Everyman's Library)	Books	5	15	16	N	N	&quot;I see everything twice!&quot;	Who is more dangerous to your sense of self-preservation, the enemy soldier who wants to kill you, or the superior officer who orders you into hostile fire?  Joseph Heller took everything that is wrong and insane about war and bureaucracy and turned it loose onto the pages of CATCH-22.<br />Time does not progress in a linear fashion is this book.  Characters that are furious when the minimum number of bomb-missions to be flown is raised to sixty are later appalled when it is raised to thirty.  The pilots and crew are trapped in an endless circle of logic, time and red tape.  Yossarian's attempts to preserve his life end with him exactly in the same place that he was before.  Everything is structured so that escape is completely impossible.  All the regulations and requirements keep looping around back upon themselves leaving Yoassarian with no options left.  <br />The strange and bizarre characters that Heller created are really what give the book its teeth.  Virtually every character has constructed a routine for himself (since this is set in the male-dominated military camps of WWII, just about all of the major characters are men) that distances him from the actual war effort.  The leaders bury themselves into the deep sands of regulation and order, and grapple with tough problems like paperwork, the military hierarchy and organizing parades.  The soldiers spend their time drinking, having sex with Italian prostitutes, getting into bar-fights or trying to get rich.  What is interesting is that almost none of the characters even mention the opposing side in the war.  CATCH-22's war is not about bravery or heroics, it is about selfishness and greed and insanity.<br />I disagree with those reviewers who have said that the order of the book appears random, as if Heller had written the book in a straightforward fashion and then merely shuffled the chapters around.  With the book written in this way, we see the development of certain characters within their own bubble of time, freed from the distractions that other characters and their unrelated subplots would bring.  It allows Heller to bring specific themes to the foreground when they are needed or let them sit in the background when they are not.<br />This is a really excellent book and I highly recommend it.  I rate it at five stars because I honestly cannot find any fault with it.  The book moves effortlessly from hilarity to tragedy while pausing only briefly to look at how the individual deals with the horror of war.  Everything in this book is absolutely and hilariously absurd.  One of Yossarian's friends, Milo, owns so many supplies and controls so much of the market that he is able to buy eggs at seven cents each, sell them at five cents and still run a handsome profit.  A computer with a sense of humour decides to promote a man to major based purely on the fact that his last name (and his middle and first names) are the same word as the position.<br />This is a must read for everyone.  The illogic will delight you, the humour will tickle you, and the reality of it all will scare the hell out of you.<br />Note: The Everyman's Library edition contains a new introduction by Malcolm Bradbury, a timeline for notable events in the period during which the book is set and the preface that Heller himself wrote for the 1994 re-issue.  If you are planning on buying this book, I recommend getting the Everyman's Library edition, as the added features are quite worth it.  Plus, it comes with one of those built-in cloth bookmarks that are so handy.	2001-03-16

Prolog itself is actually a fairly simple language to learn, albeit slightly obscure.  It's reputation for complexity comes from its non-standard implementation, but if you don't enter into it expecting it to look and behave like other languages then you should be all right.  Once you get past the mathematics and logic, you should be able to get your mind working in that particular direction.  This book is a very handy guide for getting the programmer into the Prolog mindset as well as bringing one up to speed on all the (sometimes very confused) syntax.<br />This book, like Prolog itself, is not for the beginning programmer.  If you have a good background in logic or mathematics, then you should find this book to be very rewarding.	2001-03-14

I will begin this review by mentioning that I have not seen the television mini-series that WAYS OF SEEING is based on.  However, that did not appear to detract from the text in any way, as this was both a very interesting and a highly informative read.  The book covers a lot of territory from the mind to sex to capitalism.  It's unfortunate that the book is as short as it is, as not every section gets the detailed attention that it deserves.  This book would have greatly benefited from being at least a hundred pages longer and reproducing the pictures in colour.<br />However, for what the book does have to offer it is quite good.  The book is divided into seven sections, four of which are text and three of which are pictorial essays.  The essays are all focused upon the central theme, yet can be read separately.  Each section deals with its own topic and there is very little overlap.  John Berger does a very good job at describing the effect that images have upon the mind and the mood of the viewer.  A lot of care is taken to explain these passages clearly and the examples that he uses are very effective at demonstrating his case.	2001-03-12

This was the text book used in a logic class I took. The book covers truth functions, truth tables, conditional proofs, indirect proofs, predicate logic, truth trees, syllogistic logic, inductive logic, axiomatic systems and a few other lesser used logical systems.  Each section is explained clearly and with great attention to detail.  As it is a text-book, every chapter ends with several problems for the reader to solve.  There are lots and lots of examples that help to hammer the concept home if the reader has become stuck on some of the more difficult passages.  This book is a great teacher and is an excellent resource for anyone who is interested in logic.<br />Note: The book has a URL where one can find information about errors, corrections and updates.  The first error listed on the web-page is a typographical error in the URL that's written in the book.  If I did not know better, I'd swear that the authors were trying to demonstrate circular logic.	2001-03-11

This book was the textbook used in a class I was enrolled in on microeconomics.  Since it was only an introductory course, this book did a good job of covering a lot of the basic fundamentals that one needed to know before proceeding onto more advanced material.  If all you are looking for is a rough guide to the subject without anything terribly in-depth, then this text work well for you.  The sections that are touched on are covered extremely well and everything is explained with a lot of clarity.  On the other hand, it is a rather frustrating read at times, as it breezes over some of the more interesting aspects of economics.  It would have been helpful if the author had gone into more detail during certain sections, or at least had directed the reader to other publications where one could learn more.<br />Note to the buyer: Beware that the first six chapters in this book are identical to the first six chapters in PRINCIPLES OF MACROECONOMICS (note the &quot;A&quot;) written by the same author.  And I am not exaggerating when I say they are identical -- even the practice problems are the same.  If you are looking for some variety in introducing yourself to economics, you may want to use a different set of books.  To have this much repetition in books... may not be something you are interested in, so be careful before buying the second if you already own the first.	2001-03-09

Goldberg traces teaching methods that are used today back to their origin, often showing how they weren't any more effective then than they are today.  This is not a cry back to some mythical Golden Age of Education, but rather an insistence on using the knowledge that we have of child psychology and modern methods of teaching, and creating something better.<br />The author goes into great detail explaining the effects that some of these practices have upon children.  A child may get through all four years of High School math with passing grades, but if the experience has been an unpleasant one, he or she is unlikely to develop a lifelong passion for it.  A student will come to see mathematics (for example) as something to be feared or avoided and will not likely be continuing his or her education past what is absolutely required.  Goldberg feels that this turns too many people away from knowledge, as they come to associate it with all the unpleasant things that they remember from their school days.<br />Goldberg questions the rigid structure present in the current educational system.  He claims that this stifles creativity and individuality.  Many of the anecdotes fall into the funny-because-true category (such as the stories of students forced to hold paper in their mouths to prevent their lips from moving while reading).  Not all of his criticisms are new to those who fault the public education system, but where others merely note the practices they disagree with, Goldberg goes into a lot more detail and questions why methods that have been shown to fail repeatedly over time are still being used.  Instead of just mentioning that they fail, a lot of time is spent showing how they fail, why they fail and how long they've been failing for.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in furthering one's knowledge of the educational system. There should be quite enough here for both a casual reader and someone looking for detail.  The book did not receive a full five star rating from me because I did not agree with much of the final chapter in which Goldberg says what he thinks needs to be done in order to fix the current system.  I found it to be too much like a voucher system and that would create more problems than it would solve.  However, not a lot of time was spent discussing this and one should not take from this review the idea that this book is about how to overhaul the system.  This book is primarily about what the failures are and it does an excellent job of pointing them out.stem. There should be quite enough here for both a casual reader and someone looking for detail.

Bush	Books	5	43	50	N	N	An excellent introduction to Dubya and Texas politics	This is a well-written book that highlights some of the more notable times of George W. Bush's political life.  Anyone looking for a gossipy insight into Dubya's private life during the 70's would be well advised to go elsewhere (try Fortunate Son if you can get your hands on it) as Molly Ivins goes out of her way to not dwell on the rumours that surround him.<br />This book functions well as a summary of what Dubya has done (and, more importantly, what he hasn't done) during his time as Governor.  It also brings the uninformed reader up to speed with the unique mechanics of the Texas political system.<br />When I began this book, I knew next to nothing about the political state of affairs in Texas.  The book provides a very insightful and humourous look into that state's system.  By the end, I had learned quite a bit more than just what particular policies Gov. Bush had opposed or supported.<br />As for how Bush himself comes off looking in the book, that probably depends on the reader's own prior political views.  But Ivins gives a lot of detail into the role that money played in all of Bush's elections.  The people who had Bush's ear in Texas were the one's signing the big checks, and I think it's impossible to read this book and believe that he has anyone else's interests at heart.<br />On the other hand, she does give praise where she feels he has earned it.  She discusses the role he has played in improving the Texas education system though she repeatedly points out that most of the turnaround occured based on programs that were started under the direction of the previous administration.  But she does seem impressed by his willingness to try and his desire to improve the educational system even if his methods have not always turned out the expected results.<br />All in all, I would recommend this book to everyone who gets an uneasy feeling when seeing politics in action on the nightly news.	2001-03-07

I quite enjoyed looking through the many layers (some obvious, others subtle) and I'm quite sure that I'll catch more when I read this book again.  One does not need to know anything at all about Greek, Eastern or Modern philosophy to read this book, although the more one already knows, the more one will get out of it.<br />Personally, I felt that the meditations on the role of Quality in reality started off very well.  This was a very good attempt at merging the Eastern and Western (or &quot;classical vs romantic&quot; as they are also stated in the book) modes of thinking into a single coherent thought.  Unfortunately, I felt that it fell slightly short of its goal.  Pirsig's world view would seem to add an unlimited amount of inherent facts to every object that exists.  Quality doesn't seem to me to have a single value for all things.  For example, a screwdriver would be seen to have very good Screw-Turning Quality, but would have very low Beer-Can-Opening Quality.  For every possible method, there would be a different Quality rating.  Instead of Pirsig's single combination between one subject and one object, you have all sorts of relations between an object and every possible subject.<br />Although I felt the reasoning didn't quite hold up, I found the train of thought to be an utterly fascinating one.  I very much like the idea of Quality being the relation of a mind with an object.  If nothing else, the book opens up a lot of room for meditation on the subject.  It's an interesting seed that leads the mind into all sort of passages of reason.  Even if you don't agree with his conclusions, it's a great place to start letting your brain flow.<br />The conventional story of the motorcyclist and his son, told in between the meditating, is rather enjoyable as well.  Pirsig's description of the open road is quite appealing and I found myself wanting to take a few months off and ride out into the sunset!  The passages describing the feel of the road and the differences between seeing something from inside a car versus seeing it from a motorcycle are quite good and although I've never been near a motorbike in my life, I began to understand the desire for the wide open spaces that he has.<br />The bottom line is that this is a very good book for anyone interested in philosophy, motorcycles or just well-written stories.	2001-03-07
