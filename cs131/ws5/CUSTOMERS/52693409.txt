It assumes no prior knowledge on the part of the reader, but gives enough detail to be considered a decent summary of recent historical research. Older hands will admire the sound judgements and the choice of primary sources. This is one of the best in the excellent Seminar Studies series.	2001-01-24

Each tale concentrates on a person on the wrong side of society and the law and is told in intriguing detail. Yet this book is not pure micro-history. It uses the four tales as a basis for an exploration of wider themes such as attitudes to corporal punishment, prostitution, crime and the threat of social disorder. The reader ends up with a much broader picture of German society than he might have expected. It is also a pleasure to read a history book that is devoid of academic jargon - indeed, a triumph of good writing.	2000-12-21

The storyline centres on a bunch of irresponsible rich kids fatuously whiling away the hours in a hotel which has barricaded its entrance against the common people outside. The metaphor is powerful. There are hilarious images, too, such as the comparison of silly but very wealthy young women hunting for husbands with camels plodding determinedly through the desert. My only reservation is that sometimes Green's sentences are over-complicated for what should be a smooth-as-ice satire. Green is said to have hugely admired William Faulkner, but perhaps he allowed Faulkner's influence on him to go too far.	2000-12-21

It is particularly strong on the period from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Some readers might feel that Kuisel could have developed in greater detail his concluding argument that it's all about the fact that France and America are really the only two countries in the world with a feeling that they have a &quot;universal message&quot;. This is surely the heart of the matter. Also, from the perspective of 2000, his rather upbeat chapter about how the French became significantly more pro-American toward the end of the last century looks in need of adjustment. But it's definitively recommended reading.	2000-09-27

The familiar picture emerges of a politician who didn't have the skills or temperament of Pitt the Younger  and hence was in opposition for most of his career. Yet Mitchell also makes  two very interesting observations. First, Fox often preferred his private  social life to politics. Did he, in fact, spend more time at the race track  and at his London club than at the House of Commons? Secondly, Fox was less  of a radical than most of his contemporaries thought. He was not, for  instance, especially keen on far-reaching parliamentary reform. A big  thumbs-up for this biography, not least for quoting verbatim from the  strong language of certain original sources!	2000-07-25

To the contrary, I think he has made a serious effort to examine the archives. His book is meticulously sourced, as a careful  reading of the footnotes indicates. The problem is, not all the relevant  Vatican archives are open. Thus Cornwell's account cannot be the last word  on Pius XII. Surely, though, what he has done is provide additional  confirmation of the widely held view among historians that the Catholic  Church, and Pius in particular, did not exactly cover themselves in glory  in their policies toward Nazi Germany - both in the 1933-39 period and  during the war. It should come as no surprise that the Church's principal  concern throughout this era was to look after its own interests and those  of its faithful. That, after all, is its eternal raison d'etre.	2000-07-13

Disappointingly, the author defines his subject in rather narrow political terms: there is little sense of the wider world  outside Westminster. Diarists such as &quot;Chips&quot; Channon figure  prominently among his quoted sources, but he appears to make little use of  Conservative or Labour Party archives. Nonetheless, his analysis of  episodes such as the aftermath of the 1931 election and the India crisis  shows a sure touch. Most revealing of all is his summary of how  Chamberlain's government fell - a perfect rebuttal of the myth that a  &quot;patriotic revolt&quot; in parliament during the Norway debate of May  1940 was responsible. Recommended if you enjoy dense accounts of high  politics.	2000-07-13

This won't matter to those who have a good knowledge of the times, but students fresh  to the subject should beware. The heavy reliance on US news reports of the  time suggests a certain thinness of research.

The author seems familiar with all the available source material in German  and Russian and as a result writes with complete authority. Among his  conclusions are that even the East German Communists found it hard to  accept some of the sheer brutality and bullying of the Soviet occupiers. At  the same time, the Soviet authorities were not too impressed with the East  German comrades' plans to accelerate the imposition of a Soviet-type  political and economic system. Meanwhile, rape and rapacity on the part of  the occupiers proceeded apace. A remarkable work that leaves a lasting  impression.	2000-03-09

However, it is surprising how much can be learnt about the interaction of western European societies and the Arab world by  concentrating on this fascinating period of Spain's development.

It is easy to read and provides many interesting details on subjects (often regarded these days as obscure) such as  inter-war Danzig and Poland's troubled relations with Lithuania and  Cezchoslovakia. In many ways, it is popular history more than academic  history: it has little to say on the inter-war economy and social structure  of Poland. Its account of Polish diplomacy could be a little more rigorous,  but the author, though clearly sympathetic to Poland, does not flinch  awkward facts. One drawback is that the book hardly draws at all on modern  research.	1999-12-15

As earlier reviews indicate, Turkey often arouses strong emotions abroad.  But the Popes do a good job. They are enthusiastic about the country they  live in and believe it has a promising future. Perhaps they should say more  about the darker sides of Turkish history in the 20th century. But it is  clearly their aim to strip away the more extreme stereotypes that persist  in Western perceptions of modern Turkey. Overall, a very illuminating book  in a field short of good introductions to the subject.	1999-12-14

The author does not conceal the blemishes in  Ataturk's character, but equally the reader can hardly fail to grasp the  scale of the Turkish leader's achievements against the background of the  Ottoman empire's collapse and the conservatism of Turkish traditions. A  longer biography would do greater justice to the complexities of Ataturk's  personality and historical legacy, but this is still a reliable and  enjoyable book.	1999-12-14

Whether he or the publishers are  right to suggest that France is &quot;on the brink&quot; of some serious  crisis is, however, another matter. Living in Germany and traveling  frequently to France, I get the impression France is increasingly in better  shape than its neighbor. Many French have a problem with globalization  (Americanization?), but in lots of ways the country is much more modern and  sprightly than its European neighbors. So the book rather overstates its  central argument. Its strongest points are its detailed accounts of the  political, financial and business scandals of the Mitterrand years - quite  staggering, when you come to think of them. The book's weakness is that it  drifts too much into a blow-by-blow account of recent high politics in  Paris, most of which won't be of any lasting concern even to the French  themselves. Earlier reviewers who accuse Fenby of having anti-this and  anti-that axes to grind are being unfair - overall, he gets the balance  right.	1999-10-22

Green's &quot;The Crisis of Conservatism 1880-1914&quot;. Forget about Robert Blake, he's out  of date and his work looks increasingly pompous and thin with the passage  of time. Ramsden is very astute in his judgements, and if there is one  little quibble it is with his assessment that Baldwin and Chamberlain were  somehow &quot;good eggs&quot; while Churchill was a &quot;bad egg&quot;.  This may be true in the very narrow sense of who looked after the  Conservative Party's interests when the party was in power, but surely what  counts is who did most for the country and for the free world. Neither  Baldwin nor Chamberlain, nor other deadbeats like Rab Butler, would have  risen to the occasion in 1940. Churchill did. It matters not one jot that  the Conservative Party's fortunes declined temporarily as a result.	1999-10-17

One prominent theme is that the liberal, supposedly more civilised nations of western Europe have  plenty to be ashamed about in their 20th century past. This applies not  just to the period up to the end of World War Two, but also to their  behavior in the 1990s toward the crises in former Yugoslavia. Mazower's  judgement seems likely to become a standard one in the next 20-30 years.  One can even imagine a time when the failures of Britain, France and others  are gradually merged with the catastrophe of German history up to 1945, and  with Russian history from 1917 to the late 1980s, such that little  qualitative difference is ultimately made between the histories of the  various nations of Europe. This seems to me to strain the argument too far.  Mazower searches assiduously for trends and patterns that can encompass all  of 20th-century European history, but Europe is a very fragmented entity  and each country's individuality matters. Even for the period after the  1950s, one should not reduce the history of France, Germany, Italy and so  on to the history of the European Union. The strong points of the book are  its attention to eastern Europe and its emphasis on issues such as ethnic  minorities and population displacements. It is an excellent read, though it  could have benefited from just a bit more detail (even though most of it's  already familiar) on the sheer inhumanity of the Soviet and Nazi systems.	1999-10-08

It is full of hundreds of little snapshots of events, each crying out for greater context and explanation, neither of which is provided. It is also top-heavy with the high politics of  Washington, and thus doesn't really keep its promise of giving a panoramic  view of the nation's life in 1964.

I am sure he does; it is just the unbelievable pig-headedness and  irresponsibility of some of France's most acclaimed &quot;thinkers&quot; in  the 1940s and 1950s that he cannot stand. The question that nags at the  reader as he progresses through this book is: Just why did anyone take  Sartre and co. seriously? Tony Judt not only has the answer, he issues a  very pertinent warning about the current French fashion for deriding the  intellectual perversions of the immediate post-war era. Putting it bluntly,  a certain type of bone-headed universalism and a penchant for meaningless  abstract riddles that seem peculiar to French intellectuals have by no  means disappeared.	1999-09-05

Only the extended Cold War from 1947-89 delayed  the inevitable, we are told. The strength of this book is that it  emphasises the internal reasons for Italy's troubles - and, also, the often  underestimated room for maneuver that Italy's politicians in fact possessed  to change things for the better. The last chapter or two suffer from being  too close to present-day affairs, but the bulk of the book has many useful  insights.	1999-09-05

That no doubt arose largely because of the exceptional circumstances created by JFK's  assassination. But did their feud really &quot;define a decade&quot;? No,  because the political and social canvas on which their rivalry was played  out was far greater than the author allows. That said, the book is  extremely well researched, and the wealth of primary sources that are used  enables the reader to reach his own conclusions. My main complaint is that  the author seems unduly influenced by the views of some of the young  &quot;radical&quot; advisors who surrounded RFK. The book also seems to  tilt in a slightly bitter manner against Johnson toward the end. Was  Johnson really that bad? Looking at what came after him, one is permitted  to think not.	1999-08-18

Its greatest strength is its combination of the traditional &quot;top-down&quot; narrative - what went on at the Tsarist  court, in the Duma and in the upper reaches of the Bolshevik party - with  &quot;bottom-up&quot; accounts of what life was like for ordinary people in  the cities, factories and, above all, the far-flung rural estates and  provinces of Russia. Many histories of late Tsarist Russia, the Revolution  and the early Soviet period are difficult to read because they are arid,  lacking in human detail and burdened with abstract theories of little  interest to anyone except self-important historians. But this book is  extravagantly rich in detail and often written in an exuberant,  entertaining style. One last point: the photographs reprinted in the book  are absolutely first-class, telling as much about this period of Russian  history as the text itself.	1999-06-11

There are endless lessons to be drawn from France's  disastrous policies and psychological conditions in the 1920s and 1930s.  Striking and poignant are the contrasts both with pre-1914 France and with  the nation's confident development after World War Two. Weber certainly  captures much of this, and you can't quarrel with the thrust of his  analysis. He is also a very elegant writer. Newcomers to this period of  French history will therefore greatly enjoy his book. For those with deeper  prior knowledge of inter-war France, the book may be a tad disappointing  because so much of the detail is familiar and available elsewhere.  Nevertheless, well worth reading.	1999-06-11

Leuchtenburg is such a stylish writer that the book remains well worth reading. However, some of his arguments,  particularly on the economic side, need a little updating. In addition,  there are more thorough works these days on Roosevelt's battles with the  Supreme Court and the complexities of the court's judgements.  Leuchtenburg's real achievement, though, is to bring across the sense of  hope and creativity and energy that Roosevelt infused into so many  Americans. It is the spirit of the times, as much as any supposed lessons  about government activism and demand management, that makes the New Deal  era so special. Leuchtenburg captures that spirit extremely well.	1999-06-11

Tony Judt says a great deal in a short amount of space, and he says it in a manner that is clear and straight to the  point. His strong sympathies with Blum, Camus and Aron are obvious, and  perhaps a little more needs to be said to explain why so many other French  intellectuals lost their way in these years amid the temptations of  right-wing extremism, communism and plain self-importance. But that would  have turned it into a different kind of book. Tony Judt has done a fine job  in reminding us of the courage and good sense of these three men, who did  more than most to uphold the dignity of their country in hard times.

I did see the  Mississippi river once, back in 1983, and this book brought back vivid  memories of what an extraordinary force of nature it is. The book also  evoked happy memories of a few days spent in New Orleans. As a work of  history, the book could perhaps have been edited a little more tightly, and  I agree with one or two other reviewers who have suggested that it fails to  convey all the subtleties of New Orleans and Delta life in the 1920s. But  it is a great story, and I think Barry is justified in devoting a lot of  space early on to the question of how 19th-century engineers grappled with  bringing the river under control.	1999-06-04

Of the three great men who created the Italian nation-state,  Mazzini was both more honourable and less cynical than Cavour, and more  humane and less hot-headed than Garibaldi. The contempt in which the new  state held him after 1861 was little short of disgraceful, but this  biography - well up to the standards of Mack Smith's other works on modern  Italy - does a great deal to restore his reputation. If only Italy had had  a Mazzini in the latter half of the 20th century.	1999-06-04

Kershaw's biography proves the opposite. What matters is fresh interpretation of facts, and in this respect the author provides an  interesting new approach. He places Hitler firmly in the context of his  times, both before the First World War and after the Versailles settlement.  He argues that Hitler was not some monstrous Uebermensch but a demagogue  and prejudiced fanatic who was propelled to power largely because of the  type of society Germany was in the 1920s. It sounds like a  semi-sociological approach, but Kershaw's keen sense of the historian's  discipline makes his book anything but faddish. He also corrects some  long-held errors about Hitler's early life and career that have lasted  since Bullock's biography of 40 years ago. Highly recommended.	1999-06-04

It is written from a distinctly personal point of view, and - dare one say  this about an Australian? - there is an occasional hint of pretentiousness,  particularly when he shares his thoughts about Sicilian food. But overall  the approach works, which is more than one can say about many travel books.  Together with di Lampedusa's &quot;The Leopard&quot;, an excellent book to  pass the time with if you are spending any time in  Sicily.	1999-04-20

Many myths surround the Irish past, but Foster  successfully strips them away. He is not afraid to criticise the post-1922  Irish state and politicians such as de Valera when necessary, but he  establishes beyond doubt that the record of British rule in Ireland before  that date was patchy and unwholesome at best, ignorant and vicious at  worst. He also illuminates the complexities of the Ulster problem, showing  that it is easier to caricature the province's Protestant reactionaries  than to understand them. One other praiseworthy feature of the book is its  biographical capsules, which are separated from the main text and neatly  summarise the lives of the leading personalities of Irish history.     If  you feel you have a gap in your knowledge of Ireland, you must start with  this book.	1999-04-20

A good one to dip into and select  incidents from, to amuse friends on a quiet (or not so quiet) night.	1999-04-02

The book is more about the origins and development of right-wing extremism in  Bavaria as a whole, rather than just Munich. But of course it is the  capital that has always attracted most attention, thanks partly to its  cultural pre-eminence in German life and rather more to the fact that  Hitler and the Nazis started up there. What the book brings out most  clearly is a) the existence of far-right attitudes and anti-Semitism many  years before Hitler's arrival in Munich, and b) the way in which Bavaria's  abortive Soviet revolution in 1919 turned most of the population into  ultra-conservatives unable to see clearly the terrible dangers inherent in  Nazism. Even today, Bavaria is the most conservative of German states,  and  there are still Bavarians alive who prefer to  remember the war more for  the Allied bombing of Munich than for the abominations committed by the  Nazis and SS.	1999-04-01

It is well-balanced and clearly written, picking a sensible path between the  distorted versions of Turkish history offered by those academics with too  strong a pro-Turkish or anti-Turkish bias. Turkey's present-day authorities  will almost certainly object to the book's conclusions about how best to  tackle the long-standing Kurdish problem (Zurcher proposes guarantees for  Kurdish culture and the Kurdish language, and some form of autonomy for the  south-east). But the passages on the Kurds do not dominate the book, which  is concerned mostly with tracing Turkey's turbulent road to modernity.	1999-04-01

The social tumult caused by the arrival of millions of southern and eastern Europeans was never to be repeated on quite such a scale. This book  captures some of the excitement of the age and gives an insight into why,  by the early 1920s, there was a &quot;nativist&quot; reaction. Alas, its  lively, liberal-minded arguments are not always on the right track.  Explaining the rise of anti-German sentiment, for example, it is wrong to  accuse the British and French of inventing stories of First World War  atrocities committed by Germans in Belgium. Such atrocities undoubtedly  took place - in the historic university town of Louvain, for starters. Had  this book been longer, it could have tackled such matters with greater  sophistication.	1998-12-28

If it has a weakness, it is in its treatment of the &quot;why&quot; questions.  Certainly, there was strong pressure from the popular press, public opinion  and several key figures in Congress and President McKinley's administration  to sweep away the decrepit Spanish Empire in the Caribbean and Pacific. But  it was one thing to intervene in Cuba, quite another to annex the  Philippines - as was shown soon after the war when a popular revolt broke  out against the US takeover. Musicant could perhaps have devoted more space  to exploring the impulses behind US empire-building, and a little less to  the rather confusing details of military campaigns whose outcomes were, let  us face it, hardly in doubt. That said, it is still elegantly written and a  good read.	1998-12-03

Post-unification Italy's development might well  have been  less turbulent, had it not been for the distressing tendency of successive  kings to interfere in politics and indulge their taste for intrigue.  Nurturing the tender plant of Italian democracy was usually the last thing  on their minds.    As in his other works, Mack Smith wastes little   sympathy on the civilian politicians who were, if anything, even more  culpable than their royal masters in contributing to Italy's failure to  construct a stable, corruption-free democracy before the First World War.      But his particular focus is the monarchy, from its crucial part in the  wars of unification after 1860 to its inglorious association with Benito  Mussolini's dictatorship in the inter-war years.    After putting down Mack  Smith's book - a gem of  concise writing and lightly worn learning - one  can only be glad that Italians eventually abolished the monarchy after the  Second World War. Republicanism, though drenched in corruption and crime  between 1946 and 1992, did at least do something to modernize public life  in Italy.	1998-10-30

In  the end, these were to prove almost as decisive as the greater military  strength of the Entente powers and the United States in bringing about  Germany's defeat.    As the author shows, Germany was a deeply divided  society going into the war, and the &quot;civic peace&quot; proclaimed in  August 1914 among the nation's bitterly opposed social classes and  political interests was not to last long. The attempt to sustain a war  effort against France, Great Britain and Russia - with only the hopelessly  incompetent Austro-Hungarian Empire as an ally - necessitated huge  sacrifices on the home front. Ultimately, the majority of the German  population was not willing to keep making those sacrifices, particularly on  behalf of a political system that had evolved by late 1916 from the  semi-authoritarianism of the pre-war Kaiserreich into a pure military  dictatorship.    Adolf Hitler later came to power exploiting the myth of  the &quot;November criminals&quot; - that is, those who led the German  revolution of November 1918 and  who, in his eyes, traitorously inflicted a  defeat on Germany that need never have taken place. However, as Chickering  shows in some detail, the truth is that Germany was certain by mid-1918 to  lose the war anyway.     This is a book for readers who are interested more  in the political than the military aspects of the First World War. It holds  no surprises but is authoritative and efficiently written.	1998-10-30
