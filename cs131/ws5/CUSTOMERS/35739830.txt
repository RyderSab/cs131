Rice has the rare ability to create memorable characters AND a decent plot.<br /><br />I cannot express how delighted with this book.  I admit that I thought the first chapters were a bit slow, but it quickly turned into a page turner that I didn't want to put down.<br /><br />Sinda was an unconventional but extremely likable heroine.  I liked how she was sometimes funny and witty, but never snippy or prickly.  And I loved Trev.  Rice did a phenomonal job of creating a sexy alpha male with just enough vulnerability and sweet points to make you wish he was real.<br /><br />Having read so many other romances, I thought I was familiar with all the various plot directions, but I was always guessing on this one.  Every time I thought I figured out where the story was going, Rice would change it up and then surpass my expectations.  Absolutely a five star read.	2005-10-14

I'm a fan of her contemporary romantic suspense, and thought I'd give her historical work a try.<br /><br />The book was extremely slow at the beginning.  In fact, it seemed so dry and slow-paced that I contemplated not even finishing it.  Luckily it picked up about halfway through and had a fairly exciting finish.<br /><br />I won't go into the details of the plot because I don't want to ruin all of the twists and turns for any potential readers, but in a nutshell, I just had a hard time buying this story.  In particular, I found the romance to be extremely shaky.  The protagonists hardly spent any time together, as much of the story was spent in flashbacks.  These \\"glimpses into the past\\" only made me dislike the hero.  The little twist at the end only made it worse, not better.  And to add insult to injury there was no closure whatsoever between the characters.  After the big \\"exposure of the villain\\" scene, we only see the protagonists together through a secondary character's eyes.  After putting up with the heroine's repetitive internal monologue for the entire story, we don't get inside her head at the critical finale.  Where was the usual happy ending?<br /><br />The romance in this is deserving of 1 star in my opinion, but the mystery was somewhat intriguing, so I gave it two stars overall.  Like the romance, the mystery had quite a few gaps and while I thought the Redeemer was portrayed very well as beeing an evil creep, his identity and motivation turned out to be cliche and a big let down.	2005-10-12
US	35739830	RJNWDGERPFRJY	0821777122	398886531	Final Scream	Books	5	12	15	N	N	Lisa Jackson's best	I've read several of Ms. Jackson's books, and I've always found them to be decent but I haven't ever been blown away.<br /><br />I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one.  I read the entire thing in one day; definetly a page turner!  As another reviewer mentioned, Jackson does attempt to put in a lot of mystery and suspsense, but at least for me, I found it very effective.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />The characters were great.  Brig was the typical \\"bad boy,\\" and was both sexy and sweet enough that I could see why the heroine was so attracted.  Cassidy also was very likable.  She was a spirited tomboy, and very likeable.  The romance between these two was especially sweet because we got to see them when they were young as well as in adulthood.<br /><br />I was a little surprised by how much of the book is spent on the \\"back story.\\"  Based on the book's description, I was expecting there to be maybe a couple chapters of past history, and then the majority of the book spent with Cassidy's return to her home as as an adult.  Instead, there was as much time spent in 1977 as in \\"the present.\\"  This worked out fine since the story of them as teens was interesting, but I wish there would have been a little more of them in the present.  I thought the latter half of the book was really rushed.  As much as I wanted Brig and Cassidy to be together, it was based primarily on their young love, rather than their relationship as adults.  We simply didn't get to see enough of their \\"grown up\\" selves.  Still, I wouldn't say this knocks it down from a 5 star read.<br /><br />As for the mystery, I thought it was well done.  The villan was neither too obvious, nor so obscure that it didn't make sense.<br /><br />This was great for a fun read.  And yes, it is fairly long, but like I said, it moves so quickly that I finished it in a day.  I completely enjoyed it.	2005-10-11

The plot was well thought out and well executed.  So many romance plots borderline on the ridiculous, and this one I actually found credible.  Probably because the protagonists behaved like real people.<br /><br />But as much as I found myself admiring the plot and the characters, I realized that I didn't exactly LOVE the book.  It seemed rather slow-paced for my taste.  I felt as though I kept waiting for the book to \\"really get started,\\" and then was dismayed to see that I was nearly halfway through.  The last half is certainly better than the first, however, I think it took entirely too long to really get into this book.  Also, I thought the description on the back of the book was really misleading.  I was under the impression that the \\"Robin Hood\\" aspect would be a significant part of the story, but this was not so.  I won't go into plot details and ruin the story for everyone, but I will say that I was disappointed that the Robin Hood aspect of the story was so absent.  For most of the book I thought perhaps the publishers had made a mistake and forgotten to update the book description.  The \\"real\\" plot was interesting enough, but I for one was looking forward to seeing how the author would handle a female Robin Hood figure in a romance.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />I would probably give this book three and a half stars.  I wouldn't recommend anyone against it, but I also wouldn't enthusiastically urge anyone to rush out and buy it.  Overall, just a pretty average read with its bad points neutralized by good writing and strong characters.	2005-10-10
US	35739830	R1K6YSKK6TD01Y	0778322181	4355261	Ghost Walk (Mira)	Books	1	9	22	N	N	Silly and dumb	I've read a couple of Heather Graham's \\"ghostly\\" romances and have always liked them well enough.  I expected this one to be similar; maybe not great, but a pretty good read.<br /><br />I cannot believe how bad this book was.  Usually if I don't like a book, I give it two stars because I found it boring, offensive, etc.  This is one that I found to be just plain bad.  It's been a long time since I've read a romance and been so thoroughly annoyed and disinterested with the plot and characters.<br /><br />First of all, the beginning part of the book seemed to repeat the same thing over and over every couple pages.  The plot really didn't progress at all, and the heroine who started out as kind of boring turned outright annoying.  I don't think she had any personality whatsoever.<br /><br />The hero wasn't as irritating, but he was was extremely one-dimensional.  Other than the fact that we knew his heritage, I still can't tell you anything about him.  There was never any sort of description of him except for his appearence, and he usually only said one sentence at a time, so we definetly didn't get to know him through his diologue.<br /><br />Once the author finally started to develop the \\"plot\\" it went from being boring to ridiculous.  To borrow another reviewer's word, the ghost scenes were corny, as was the author's attempt to make EVERY secondary character a possible suspect. I was never even exactly sure what it was they were suspects for.  The back of the book makes it sound like the ghost of the government agent plays an important part of the story.  Had this been true, the plot might have actually been interesting, but the bulk of the book barely mentions the guy except for Nikki to deny over and over that she saw his ghost.<br /><br />Basically the story seemed to run around in circles.  New information was rarely presented, and when it was I couldn't figure out how it tied into the rest of the weak plot.<br /><br />I very, very rarely read books that I consider to be \\"one stars,\\" but I would never have even finished this one had I not been stuck in an airport with absolutely nothing else to do.  Other books by Heather Graham are probably worth a read if you like hauntings and ghosts, but this one was painful.en finished this one had I not been stuck in an airport with absolutely nothing else to do.

Teresa Medeiros' books are \\"hit or miss\\" for me, and this one probably fell into the latter category.<br /><br />I thought the beginning was very promising.  I'm always intrigued by stories where the protagonists meet as children, and I liked where I thought the story was going.  However, the more I read the more I realized I wasn't really enjoying the developing plot.<br /><br />Overall, the book felt sort of \\"contrived\\" to me.  There wasn't a natural flow to it.  I felt almost annoyed with some of the plot developments, rather than intrigued.<br /><br />Perhaps I just wasn't in the right mood when reading this book. This is not your average \\"flirtation/bantering\\" romance, and while I don't always expect my romance plots to be completely happy and smooth sailing, this one was just a little too dark for my tastes.<br /><br />If you're looking for a deep and complex relationship, this actually has a rather moving love story.  However, if you're looking for a sweet \\"feel good\\" romance, this didn't do the trick for me.  Not a bad book by any means, but for some reason I felt depressed while reading it.  Also, I didn't like the drastic character change in the heroine from the beginning of the book to the end.  While I understand the reason for her change in character, she frankly became just plain mean.  She went from being quite sweet to constant whining and snipping.  Like I said, probably true to live given her circumstances, but NOT what I have in mind for a likeable romance heroine.	2005-10-05

After reading and loving the first Wallflower book (\\"Secrets of a Summer Night\\") I was especially excited for Lillian's story, which I thought Kleypas set up nicely in the first book.  With such high expectations, I figured I was bound to be a little disappointed, but instead I discovered what I think to be Kleypas' best.<br /><br />Lillian and Marcus were by far my favorite protagonists.  Lillian in particular was a refreshing delight.  I enjoyed being introduced to her in Secrets of a Summer Night, and she didn't let me down in this story.  She is spirited and outspoken, but not so much that she got on my nerves like many other \\"spunky\\" heroines.  I could totally see how Marcus would be intrigued by her indvidiuality.  Marcus himself was also a wonderful hero.  He was more multi-dimensional than the typical \\"reformed rake\\" hero.  I just loved how he would go from arguing and wanting to strangle her to being so sweet and caring.<br /><br />I almost never find myself outwardly amused by books, but several times throughout this one I found myself smiling while reading, and I actually laughed out at a couple of scenes.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that the ending didn't seem to fit with the rest of the book.  It was interesting enough, but I thought that the author was focusing more on setting up the next Wallflower hero than she was finishing up with Lillian and Marcus' story.<br /><br />Still, this is definetly my favorite so far (and I am a HUGE fan of her other books), mostly because I thought Lillian and Marcus were great as individuals, and perfectly suited for one another.	2005-10-04

As a huge Sandra Brown fan, I'll be the first to admit that her earlier love stories are a bit of a let down when compared to her more recent and more detailed novels.  Once she made the jump from her short romances to her longer romantic suspense, it's clear that her strength really lies in the latter (try Exclusive, Best Kept Secrets, Where There's Smoke).<br /><br />If you read Loves Encore and compare it to Brown's later mysteries, you're bound to be disappointed.  However, as far as short, sweet romances go, Brown's really aren't bad at all.  I've read most of them, and I really thought this was one of the better, despite it being the author's first.<br /><br />Like other reviewers I thought it was a bit shallow in character and plot development, but looking at it from a purely romantic standpoint, I actually loved it.  The story was terribly sweet.  I would put it more in the category of a modern fairy tale than I would a well-thought out novel, but for a quick afternoon read to give you a smile, this will certainly do the trick.  Most of these early Sandra Brown romances I found to be pretty unremarkable, but this one ended up on my bookshelf for a quick \\"pick me up.\\"	2005-10-04

The description on this one looked great, and because I've seen the spirited Hycanith as a secondary character in her siblings' stories, I was especially looking forward to her finally geting her own book.<br /><br />Unfortunetly, I barely finished it.  I read the first half and was so bored I set it aside and read several other books before finally coming back in hopes that the end would redeem the beginning...it didn't.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, Hycanith isn't particularly endearing.  We're forever told how clever and witty she is, but we never see that.  Instead she just seems sort of boring.  There is far more time spent describing her through the eyes of others than there is \\"seeing her in action,\\" and as a result I felt like I hardly knew her.<br /><br />The hero was fine, but rather unremarkable due to lack of chemistry between the characters.  It seemed as though the author was lacking in energy or creativity, or both.  The entire story seemed formulaic and dull.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of one out of loyalty to Ms. Quinn, but if this would have been the first book I read by her I would not have even bothered to finish.  In a nutshell, this book just dragged and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money(do try other books by Julia Quinn though...this dud is not her norm!).	2005-10-04

Frankly, you will most likely be rather disappointed if you're a Judith fan, because this book has a very different feel than her others.<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy this book, but I was disappointed by the fact that the protagonists didn't really seem to have that much interaction.  We get a lot of their back story and teen years, which seems to set up the story very well for their future reunion.  However, once they reconnect, their whirlwind romance was rather unfulfiling.  Other than a couple of Judith's trademark heart-touching scenes, I didn't see quite enough of the two heroes together to get the usual excitement to see how they end up together.<br /><br />This had all the makings of a great story, I think perhaps it just lacked a little depth.  The book was plenty long, but it seemed as though she could have cut out some parts, and beefed up interaction between Diana and Cole.<br /><br />If you haven't read other Judith McNaught stories, recommend those over this one.  If you're already a Judith convert, read this one with caution, knowing that's different from her usual.	2005-10-04

I seem to be in the minority here, but I actually liked this book for the most part, and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little magic in their romance.<br /><br />Unlike most other reviewers, I've never been a Christine Feehan fan.  I've read several of her books only because they've been lent to me, but I'd never go out of my way to spend money on one.<br /><br />This one caught me off guard because I was genuinely interested in the story.  It took me a while to figure out what was going on, but the puzzle kept my interest.  In particular, I liked the story of the seven sisters.  The interaction among family members made for a more in depth story, rather than just focusing on the two main characters.  Not to say the romance was lacking; the sex scenes were plentiful and steamy, and the love between the two both intense and sweet.<br /><br />Thus, I would say that if you haven't read Christine Feehan before, or are not usually a fan, you might give this book a shot.  If you ARE a fan of CF (as many other reviewrs are), you may not like this one as much, as it seemed different from her usual style.	2005-10-04

However, I must say that being a huge Lisa Kleypas fan, I didn't think this was her best work.  Most of her other stories I have reread or plan to reread, but I'm not sure I'd pick up \\"Dreaming of You\\" a second time.<br /><br />After hearing such enthusiastic praise for this book, I was expecting to be really blown away.  And while I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I was a bit disappointed, probably due to my high expectations.  There is nothing at all wrong with the story, I just thought it lacked some of the energy and suspsense of stories such as \\"Lady Sophia's Lover,\\" \\"Someone to Watch Over Me,\\" \\"Stranger in My Arms,\\" etc.<br /><br />As far as protagonsits go, Sara and Derek were well suited and charming, but not overly memorable in my opinion.  I'm also a little confused by the overwelming enthusiasm over Derek (both in reviews, and from friends who read the book).  I liked him very much, but there have been other heroes who have I've found to be more moving and touching.  Although Derek was great, I was expecting someone truly amazing and unique based on all the praise I've heard.  For those who are a big fan of these \\"tortured heroes\\" , I highly recommend trying Judith McNaught books such as \\"Once and Always,\\" or \\"Something Wonderful.\\"  Those are two of my absolute favorite books, and Derek reminded me of those heroes.<br /><br />Overall, Dreaming of You is a sweet book, and if you're looking for a dependable page-turner with a sweet story, this definetly fits the bill.  Just be sure you also try some of Lisa's other books!	2005-10-03

I picked up this book at the grocery store, not expecting it to be anything remarkable because I'd never heard of the author, and the plot summary sounded a little strange.<br /><br />I was in for quite a surprise.  I read the entire thing in one night.  I typically stick with historical romance, but this was a great contemporary.  The characters were fun, and I could see how the romance would develop...it didn't seem forced or contrived at all.  I haven't read much having to do with the supernatural or paranormal, but I thought it was well executed in this book.  Enough \\"magic\\" to make the plot interesting, but not so much that it became silly.<br /><br />Also, I loved how this author used specifics.  Others might say it was a lot of \\"name dropping\\" and reference to pop culture, but I found it enjoyable considering most authors shy away from such specifics.  Normally I have a hard time relating to characters in romances because I can't see them as \\"true to life,\\" but here it was easy to identify with the protagonists.<br /><br />My only complaint was that there were a couple plot strands that weren't seen all the way through to completion.  I won't say what for risk of ruining the plot for others, but after I finished the book I realized that there were a couple points she never went back to, or that she didn't pay quite enough attention to.  Still, this wasn't enough to knock it down from a 5 star rating...	2005-09-29

With so many great books out there, why waste time rereading?<br /><br />Kingdom of Dreams forced me to reverse my opinion because I have read the book cover to cover three times, and have reread my favorite parts several more times.  Nearly all of Judith McNaught's books have the same sweet, heart-wrenching quality.  But this book in particular takes the readers on an emotional roller coaster.  I couldn't put it down - not because the plot was filled with adveture or twists, but simply because the romance of the two characters is fully compelling.<br /><br />I thought they were wonderfully matched.  Often times I focus on the protagonists as a couple, but in this story I loved them as individuals as well.  McNaught has mastered making the heroes strong and gruff and then perfectly sweet.  As for Jenny, I thought she was very well written and developed.  Yes she was impulsive and young, but for once I could see how the hero was charmed instead of annoyed.<br /><br />As for the last review that described Jenny as a stupid idiot; I must admit that I don't see that at all.  I don't normally go out of my way to disagree with other reviews, but in this case, I got an entirely different read on the heroine.  I don't understand how she should have some \\"sense knocked into her\\" about her family when it's all she's known for 17 years.  It doesn't make sense to me that she would all of a sudden abandon her old life simply because a stranger tells her to.  Part of her appeal is that she's strong-willed and not a pushover.  She had to discover her family's treachery on her own, not based on hearsay by the other characters.  If I could use only one adjective to the heroine, I would say \\"clever.\\"  How other readers interpret her to be stupid, I really cannot understand.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. If you're looking for something light and short, this probably isn't it.  But if you're looking for truly emotional scenes and a very well developed romance, this is worth every penny.ooking for something light and short, this probably isn't it.

I have read countless romance novels, and often times even the ones that I really enjoyed start to blur together in my memory, and I seldom remember details.<br /><br />This I loved this book upon reading it, but more significantly, it is one of the very few books that crosses my mind from time to time even years after I've put it aside. I  no longer have the book (I borrowed it from a friend), but I remember almost everything about the story.  I recently saw it again in the book store and am considering buying it just for the reread.  The only time I've ever reread a romance is if Judith McNaught is the author.  For those of you who enjoy Judith, I wouldn't hestitate to recommend this one, as I can see similarities between Kurland and McNaught's style, if not in plot.<br /><br />I thought the protagonists were perfect for one another.  Kurland was able to provide plenty of detail and characterization without resorting to the \\"dark\\" history that so many authors rely on.  I was torn between not wanting this one to end and being desperate to read the happy ending.<br /><br />Even if you're not big on time travel (I haven't often seen it done successfully), I'd say this book is perfect for a quiet afternoon or evening when you're craving a sweet and fun story.	2005-09-13

I expected great things based on the five stars reviews here, but I wasn't very impressed with this book.  It actually took me over a week to finish it.  Normally I'll read a good book straight through in a day or two, but I kept setting this one aside for more interesting books. It's plot was unique enough to have me coming back to it eventually, but I was never in a big hurry to see how it ended.<br /><br />I thought the plot and the characters had real potential, but there needed to be a little more detail and depth in order to give it that sense of richness of a great romance.<br /><br />The story seemed to be told on a superficial level, in that we were told the bare facts about what was happening and who the characters were.  There was simply not enough descriptions or depth to create a really dynamic story.  Usually I feel that romance novels err on the side of giving too much detail that bogs down the story, but in case I think more detail was needed in order to hook the reader.  For example, there were plenty of secondary characters who I would have liked to see more of, but they would only appear for 1 paragraph to 1 page at a time.  Not enough time for us to care about these more minor characters, or to get to know the protagonists through interactions with others.<br /><br />That being said, I did see real potential with this story as it had a unique plot and appealing characters.  I think with a little more depth it could have made for a really great crime caper and a great romance.  This was the first book I've read by this author, but despite being less than impressed, I would definetly give her another shot in the future to see if she's improved.	2005-09-12

Overall it mildly entertaining, but although it was the first of an apparent trilogy, I probably won't make any effort to seek out the next two sisters' stories.<br /><br />The characters were flat.  I found that descriptions of their personalities seemed rather repetitive and \\"forced.\\"  For example, it is brought up over and over how the heroine is very traditional but this alone hardly makes for an interesting character and doesn't contribute much to the story.  I never developed a good sense of who the heroine was outside of a couple traits which were mentioned repeatedly, and frankly these traits made her more boring than compelling.<br /><br />I don't want to ruin the story for any potential readers, but one aspect of the hero's \\"personality,\\" was just plain ridiculous.  I normally can tolerate a lot of semi-unrealistic aspects in romance plots, but this almost made me groan out loud when I figured out where the author was going with it.<br /><br />The hero's scandal referred to in the book description was not convincing.  It eventually turned into a mystery that the heroine became obsessed with solving, but it wasn't at all compelling enough to drive the story.  The way in which the hero and heroine responded to the scandal should have been admirable but instead seemed artificial. No real suspsense was ever created either in the \\"mystery\\" or the \\"romance\\" aspect of the story.<br /><br />Also, I was initially drawn to the book because I thought the heronine's family legacy of \\"magical\\" desserts would tie into the story.  The picture on the cover and the descritpion on the back of the book are misleading.  Yes, each chapter begins with a dessert recipe, and that dessert is served somehow in the chapter, but it served NO use to furthering the plot.  Basically the heroine's family is known for always having a dessert but the author didn't give it enough attention to make it the center of the story in some way.  Instead it seemed to just be stuck into each chapter for no apparent reason.

US	35739830	R37WT380XCRMUQ	0373285108	333575042	Night Tales: Night Shift & Night Shadow	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Good series, but I didn't like the heroine	I've read so many of Nora Roberts' books that I rarely write reviews.  All of her characters and stories seem pretty similar and they all blend together.<br /><br />This one sticks out in my mind because of how much I did not like one of the heroines.  Cilla from Night Shift just rubbed me the wrong way.  Nora has created many a \\"testy\\" heroine in her career, and normally I'm a big fan of the standoffish woman melting into a woman in love.<br /><br />Cilla however just seemed to grate at every turn.  Although the story was interesting, I just could not understand what Boyd saw in her.  She seemed overly defensive, rarely friendly, appreciative or kind.  She did sacrifice a lot to take care of her sister; she had that going for her.  But even keeping that in mind I don't think she deserved Boyd.  As I said, I've read nearly all of Nora's books, and this is the only one in which I so strongly disliked one of the main characters.<br /><br />Cilla's sister Deborah was far more appealing(in Night Shadow), and I actually enjoyed the plot of that one much better as well.  Overall I'd certainly recommend this series, as it has a little more mystery than Nora's standard fair.  There are two more books following this one (six stories total) all which are worth a read.  However, it was almost that dislike of Cilla in Night Shift which turned me off of the whole series.  They get better after that one!	2005-09-09
US	35739830	RE19Z65CPVAI0	0553587536	283867745	The Marriage Trap	Books	5	11	13	N	N	a suprisingly good read!	I have never been a huge Elizabeth Thorton fan.  I've found her books to be satisfactory in the past, but perhaps a bit dry and lacking in spark for my taste.<br /><br />A friend highly recommended The Marriage Trap, and although I wasn't expecting to be too impressed, I was pleasantly surprised.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is one of the rare stories in which I could actually see the romance developing.  The protagonists weren't completely convinced it was \\"true love\\" from the start, but rather got to know each other much as \\"real life\\" relationships evolve.  While this might sound like it is dull (I too normally prefer the \\"sweep me off my feet\\" romance) but the diologue was clever and the characters were very likable (particularly Ellie).  And although the Ellie and Jack seemed more grounded than other romantic heroes, there was still no shortage of sweet moments in which you knew they were made for each other.<br /><br />There was the perfect balance of a genuinely interesting mystery and the developing romance, with a cast of secondary characters that perfectly complimented the protagonists.  The comparisons between Ellie and Frances (sister-in-law) were very effective, as was the more lighthearted comparison between Jack and his fashionable friend Ast.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was a perfectly balanced and charming story, that I would highly recommend.  My only complaint is very minor: the ending could have been just a bit stronger in my opinion.  The mystery was wrapped up fairly satisfyingly, but I didn't feel there was enough closure between the two main characters.  Of course, in keeping with the nature of their relationship, in a lot of ways it made more sense for them to have a simple \\"happily ever after\\" moment rather than the usual dramatic conclusions I usually look for.<br /><br />Definetly try this one whether or not you're an Elizabeth Thorton fan.	2005-09-09
US	35739830	RG64OC2RA0TS2	0060527048	585986262	To Marry the Duke	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Why the bad reviews?	I'm surprised by how many bad reviews this book received.  I am generally fairly picky about my romance novels, rarely finding any that inspire me to look for others by the same author.  However, I enjoyed this one so much that I eagerly looked for the two sequels in the trilogy.<br /><br />Perhaps if I'd been more concerned with historical accuracy, I would have been disappointed with her \\"modern\\" heroines, however I found it rather refreshing to read about a heroine who was spunky rather than passive.  The hero was just dark and cynical enough that his transformation at the end was fully rewarding.<br /><br />My only complain comes from looking at the book as part of a trilogy.  While I greatly enjoyed all of them, the plot similarites between the three was a little disappointing. I can't explain much without ruining any plot twists, but MacLean does seem to lack a bit in creativity.<br /><br />Overall, I would say I was quite charmed and pleasently surprised by this new author.  The story was far fetched at times, but this didn't stop it from being a very sweet read.	2005-09-08
US	35739830	R2T1CX7CK07IJK	0060597291	841743518	Love According to Lily	Books	3	9	12	N	N	Such a disappointment	After getting to know the characters in Judith MacLean's trilogy about three American heiresses who sweep into London high society (To Marry the Duke is the first in that series, and a great read), I was so excited when I saw Lily's story had finally been published.  Perhaps my expectations were too high, because as much as I expected to love it, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I didn't think the protagonists had quite enough chemistry.  We of course know that Lily's loved him all along, but I wasn't convinced that he ever really returned her feelings.  And since her feelings seemed more like infatuation more than love, I couldn't even muster much sympathy for Lily's situation.<br /><br />Everything about the plot seemed slightly too calculated.  Being a romance, we of course know that they'll end up together, but there wasn't any real suspense in seeing how they would get there.  And frankly, I didn't really care.  The characters just didn't engage me.  I thought the hero was preoccupied and selfish (I can't even remember his name now), and I never saw Lily develop from the lovesick girl in the previous books into a woman in love.<br /><br />I almost gave this two stars, because compared to the others by this author, this one was far beneath them.  But in fairness, had I not had such high expectations, I might not have been quite so disappointed.  Based on comparison to the other MacLean stories it was a 2 star, but when compared to all the romances I've ever read this is probably a 3 start.  Really not a bad book, just a let down.  I've read much worse.<br /><br />Normally I really enjoy stories in which the characters know each other from childhood, but I couldn't warm up to this story.  Try MacLean's other stories if you haven't already, but finishing with this one was a disappointing good-bye to these characters.	2005-09-08

The plot was detailed and unique enough that it kept me turning pages, and I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />Why only 3 1/2 stars then?  I guess after I finished the book, I didn't have the usual sense of satisfaction I get from a really great romance.  All of the makings and potential was there, but somehow it didn't ring true.<br /><br />First, the plot while being very intricate, seemed to have a few holes.  I don't need my romances to be overly realistic, but in this one I had a hard time buying many of the characters' actions; particularly the heroine, Lizzie.  I think that in Brenda Joyce's effort to write an original plot, she sacrificed credibility in order to explore new material.<br /><br />Also, I found the hero to be lacking.  True, he said \\"all the right things,\\" and it was touching to see his obvious emotion for the heroine.  But, I don't think the author gave us enough time with him.  We only see him through others' eyes in the first several chapters of the book, and by the time we actually get inside his head, the plot is fairly well developed.  Too often it seemed that all of my perceptions of Tyrell came from other characters discussion of him.  We encounter nearly every secondary character mentioning the hero's loyalty, goodness, steadiness, etc.  But we rarely see him BEING any of those things.  Also, his commitment to his \\"duty\\" was unrealistic in that his motivations were never explored.  I didn't dislike the hero, I just thought that we were forced to accept him at face value.  This was especially disappointing in a Brenda Joyce novel - her heroes are usually much stronger.<br /><br />In fairness, however, I did appreciate Tyrell's seeming kindness and ability to look beneath the rather ordinary appearance of the heroine.  I think Joyce was trying to expand her genre by creating a hero who was attracted to a sweet but plain heroine.  I actually found that quite refreshing; but I think I'm mostly partial to my \\"tougher\\" alpha males.<br /><br />The heroine was extremely good and kind without being sickly sweet, but at times I found her tendency to be a martyr a little over the top.  I understand making sacrifices for those we love, but in Lizzie's case, it sometimes just came across as an inability to stand up for herself even when she was treated unfairly by those closest to her.  I find that romance heroines sometimes walk the fine line between being sweet/generous and being a doormat.  Lizzie primarily falls into the \\"sweet\\" category, but every so often I thought she needed to stand up for herself a bit more.  True, she was quite admirable, but without spoiling any plot detail, I sometimes wished she was just a little bit stronger in defending herself.<br /><br />Overall, the book was highly entertaining, filled with plenty of sensuality and sweet romance, but I just thought something was missing.  The plot was intricate, but in hindsight I can't really figure out why the characters acted the way they did.  They seemed largely scripted around obvious plot devices.  Too much author \\"manipulative creativity\\" and not enough character development.  We were told the characters developed and how, but we never actually SAW it happen.<br /><br />Great for a fun read, and long and detailed enough so it actually lasts longer than an afternoon.  But as far as a romance that touched my heart in order to be truly memorable, this one fell a little short..

I know other readers have said this isn't her best work, but I found all of her others disappointing in comparison to this one.<br /><br />This was the first of her heroines that I really liked.  Her other stories were pretty good, and very sweet, but the females tended to grate on my nerves.  Not so in \\"Yours Until Dawn.\\"  I enjoyed how the heroine was neither \\"in your face\\" or meek.  She spirited/spunky without being precocious and immature.<br /><br />I have always been partial to Beauty and the Beast stories, which probably explains why I enjoyed this so much.  The \\"obvious twist\\" that others referred to wasn't terribly obvious to me, although in hindsight I suppose it was pretty silly of me to miss what was going on.  Nonetheless, it was a pleasent surprise that added to the Beauty and the Beast tale rather than detracting from it.<br /><br />I would definetly recommend this book.  It's rare for me to pick up an unfamiliar author and be so thoroughly charmed, so perhaps I'd suggest this book most for those not familiar with Medeiros' other works.  I thought this to be better than her other stories, but if you're a diehard fan of her books, you might not enjoy this one as much as it read a bit differently.	2005-08-30

As other readers have pointed out, it borderlines on feeling a bit creepy.  On the one hand, I can understand the desire to take revenge into one's own hands - rape in particular is an issue that our legal system often isn't able to handle adequately.  And while I certainly felt no sympathy for the rapists themselves, something about the whole book left me feeling rather disturbed.<br /><br />Subject matter aside, the writing style is truly the worst I've ever encountered.  The diologue was painful to read...almost unbelievable in its simplicity.  Also, the inconsistencies were obvious - I cannot understand how the editor missed such big errors as character name confusion and time frame inconsistencies.  Not that they were detrimental to the story, but it only added to the overall immature feeling of the book.  Also, the characters were the flattest I've ever read.<br /><br />I would give this book zero stars if I could.  I'm only wasting my time writing this in order to encourage others not to waste their money, or time reading this (although it is almost laughably short with huge print).	2005-08-18

This is one of those books that I would read only if I was bored and had NOTHING else available, and if it was handed to me for free.  In other words, definetly don't spend money on it, and waste your time only if you are in desperate need of reading material.<br /><br />That being said, it's not the worst book I've ever read, but I really can't recommend it at all.  It was my first Karen Robards historical romance, and while I'm a fan of her contemporary work, something about this historical novel didn't sit well with me.  Normally I am a huge fan of the genre, but this seemed both too dark, and yet also too unsubstantial.<br /><br />As another reader said, the heroine is treated like dirt for most of the novel.  While the hero has moments of kindness, he rarely reprimands his younger brothers and sons for their cruelty, who undeniably look up to him and respect his opinion. It seems as though he might do a bit more to defend her. The heroine's reaction to all of this alternates between being passive and throwing tantrums.  I'm not saying I could have done much better in her situation, but the inconsistencies in her behavior made it hard for me to figure out her feelings.<br /><br />Even after the family accepts her at the end of the novel, there are never any sort of apologies or acknowledgements of their cruel words.  I understand this is probably realistic for male/female relations at the time, but in a romance novel, it wasn't very appealing.<br /><br />The subplots centering around her dead sister and the vindictive townspeople isn't really fleshed out, and yet we are expected to understand how it's a major part of the plot and character motivations.<br /><br />In fairness, I guess I can see how other readers might like it, as the romance is halfway fun to watch develop. If I'd been in the mood for a glimpse into the misery of women in the colonial period or for witch trials I actually might have enjoyed the detail and depth of this book.  But, expecting a romance, I found myself disappointed.  I prefer romances that that make me feel warm at the end, not relieved that it's over...ance, I found myself disappointed.

The fact that it spans so many years is far different from other romances that I've encountered.  I don't think I'd like this \\"epic\\" style in every book I read, but because it was rather unique, I enjoyed it in this story.<br /><br />The characthers definetly aren't very likable, but at the same time they are really well suited, which somehow makes their romance endearing.  The heroine is a spoiled, vain brat and the hero is self-pitying and the ultimate \\"jerk jock,\\" but they were so enthusiastic about their flaws that you almost had to like them.<br /><br />I give SEP credit for not falling into a typical romance formula, as I was continually surprised by the various plot turns.<br /><br />Probably not my favorite book ever...I didn't like how the main characters were seperated for so long, and how perhaps they didn't know each other all that well.  But, for a fun read, this definetly does the trick.	2005-08-17

I gave this book 5 stars because I love Lisa Kleypas, and she has never let me down.<br /><br />The most notable thing about this book is the sensuality, so if you're not a fan of more graphic love scenes, this may not be the book for you.  For the rest of us, this definetly is one of the more \\"steamy\\" I have encountered.<br /><br />I agree wholeheartedly with all of the other reviewers' praises, but with only two additions.  First, I actually thought the hero was a tad too perfect.  On one hand I found myself thinking \\"wow, what a great guy,\\" but at times his noble perfection grated on my nerves just a TINY bit.  And, as this is part of a set, I'd have to recommend \\"Someone to Watchover me\\" and \\"Worth Any Price\\" over this one...I LOVED those!  Still, this is worth a read.	2005-08-17
US	35739830	RW87A08Y9IG2F	0446604232	917393950	Exclusive	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Great Fun!	First, let me say that some of the other reviewers are correct in that this is not a terribly deep story.  But if you're looking for such a story, Sandra Brown is probably not the author for you.  Nonetheless, I would STRONGLY recommend this book if you're looking for a fun, fast-paced mystery with an unconventional, but sweet relationship developing alongside the mystery.<br /><br />Exclusive is definetly a page turner...I couldn't put it down!  Far-fetched, yes, but also great fun, particulary if you're looking for a good vacation book.  The mystery is kind of quirky, but very gripping.<br /><br />The hero is the perfect tough guy throughout, but with key moments of kindness.  And as another reader says, Barrie is a fabulous heroine. Very feisty, but the author also lets her make many mistakes which makes her all the more human.  In short, the two of them have really great chemistry which sometimes doesn't happen in the more \\"hearts and flowers\\" type romances.  Yes, the relationship is heavily centered on the physical aspect, but there are enough tender moments to keep it satisfying.<br /><br />In addition to the the romance, there are also perfectly dispicable villains, and plenty of plot twits and action.<br /><br />I'm a great Sandra Brown fan, and this is definetly one of my favorites.  If you're looking for another of hers to try, I'd recommend \\"Where There's Smoke.\\"  She used to write romances which are also worth a read, but her more contemporary romantic suspenses are a hit nearly every time.<br /><br />If you want complex characters, and unsensational plot, or hearts and flowers romance, this isn't for you, but if you want a fast, fun and sexy read, try Exclusive!	2005-08-15
US	35739830	R28B5NUSK05PZ2	051512608X	950568892	The Reef	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Best of Nora	First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed.  While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable.  I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read.  Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery.  Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here.  Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching.  As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end.  The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora.  In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try!  Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read.	2005-08-11

This was my first Judith McNaught book, and I went on to collect her other novels with enthusiasm.  I actually found Pefect on a bookshelf of a rental condo during vacation, and picked it up out boredom on a rainy day.  I could not put it down, and was tempted to steal it because going out to buy it would take too long!  The tenderness of the characters was so moving that I went back to reread key passages (something I never do).  Many reviewers mentioned the connection between this and Paradise, however I was surprised how many people mentioned that Perfect came \\"close to Paradise.\\"  While both are definetly worth a read, I actually preferred Pefect.  Paradise is also among my favorite romances, but if you could ONLY read one, I'd have to recommend Perfect.  A note of caution: while there is an element of mystery in the plot, be aware that it's definetly secondary to the romance.  Don't be fooled into thinking you're picking up a romantic suspsene, as the only real suspense comes from the relationship.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough!	2005-08-11

Although I am a huge Judith McNaught fan (I've read and reread them all), Until You is definetly my least favorite.  I wanted and expected to like it, but was dismayed to find halfway through that I was not all that into it.  I'm not sure what it was that didn't appeal to me, but somehow the story lacked the sweetness of Judith's other books, and at times I actually found it boring.  I followed it through to the end expecting at least to have one of Judith's trademark finales, but even that was a let down.  I gave this book three stars, because compared to Judith's other books I thought it was mediocre.  However, in fairness I would say that it definetly rates higher when compared to all other historical romances.  Because so many other people liked it, I suppose I'd say it's worth a read, but if you're a huge Judith McNaught fan, be prepared for a departure from her other stories.	2005-08-11
