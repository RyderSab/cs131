When a user visits your site, he/she will be bringing a large load of mental baggage accumulated from prior visits to thousands of other home pages. So by the time they reach your web site, users have accumulate a generic mental model of the way a homepages are supposed to work, based on their experience on these other sites.<br />It is a very interesting point. According to authors of the book, there are few large web sites that might count themselves among the first 10 to 20 sites visited by new users. And design of these web sites dictate the design conventions that a user will expect when he/she visits other web sites.<br />Example of some of these conventions mentioned in the book are:<br />upper-left corner is the best place for a site logo<br />upper-right corner are more generic locations for search widgets and \\"help\\" links<br />Navigation of the site is best usable either as a tab-style (such as in amazon.com) or as a column on left side of the page (such as in CNN.com)<br />Links should be blue-underlined, and visited links should be purple-underlined<br />footer navigation links should be only for \\"foot-note-related\\" content and should be limited to no more than 7 links<br />on and on it goes<br />So how do authors derive these conclusions? The process is actually very interesting. They conduct studies of top 50 chosen web sites and group their findings into conventions.<br />The book also \\"deconstructs\\" those 50 chosen Home Pages, and provides annotated analysis. You may find it interesting. Among those are such sites as About.com, Accenture.com, Yahoo.com, BBC Online, CNET, Disney, eBay, Microsoft, IBM and many more.<br />Although majority of the book is on annotating home pages, authors also give some generic tips on home page design. Some of those tips I recall are:<br />liquid page layout is preferred over fixed sized tables<br />the most optimal page width is 760 pixels (for fixed layout)<br />page length of the homepage should be around two full screens, but not more than four<br />frames suck big time<br />horizontal scrolling is the curse<br />\\"Guest Books\\" are not for pros<br />Do not use exclamation marks!<br />and on and on it goes<br />While reading homepage annotations, I felt very strong emphasis on the title of the homepages (the one between &lt;title> and &lt;/title> tags). These tags are easily left un-noticed, one would think. But properly chosen titles make big difference while bookmarking your page. Try it yourself.<br />In other words, do not start your titles with \\"The\\" and \\"Welcome\\", because in person's favorites lists, it would be misplaced in the alphabetical order.<br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone venturing in Web Designs.<br />P.S. Although the book is on Home Page usability, the book itself doesn't seem \\"usable\\" at all.

I had never thought of HTTP in such a broad scale before I read \\"HTTP::The Definitive Guide\\". Apparently, Web sites and Web browsers are not the only things that should come to mind when one thinks of HTTP. Flexibility of the protocol made it home for so many breakthroughs of the Internet. It's amazing that there were no comprehensive textbooks covering the topic until today.<br />Organizing such enormous data in a 500-line book is a challenge already. But authors managed to go even beyond. The result was a well organized, comprehensive and amazingly easy to follow book.<br />The book is organized into 6 large sections. Each section is split into Chapters. Wherever appropriate, authors use figures and diagrams to illustrate the point.<br />The first section, called \\"Web's Foundation\\" covers most of the things an average web developer may already have known. It starts off with a chapter on HTTP Overview, and covers such topics as URLs, HTTP Messages - requests and responses, connections - parallel, persistent and pipeline. Some of the highlights are HTTP versions and their differences, URL conversion algorithms and status codes.<br />The second section, called \\"HTTP Architecture\\", is probably the most informative section with lots of gory details. It discusses existing technologies that make things happen - players of the Web. Starts with Web Servers that actually serve the original content. Takes you step by step what exactly happens once the Server accepts the request from your browser and displays you the page. Other technologies, such as Proxies, Caching, Gateways, Tunnels and Relays are very well covered. They even talk about Web Robots (a.k.a. Crawlers) and allocate over 30 exciting pages on these both annoying and incredibly useful \\"creatures\\". The section is finished with a brief overview of HTTP-NG, also called \\"Next Generation HTTP\\".<br />\\"Identification, Authorization, and Security\\" is the next section, that talks about just that. Detailed coverage on Cookies, Basic and Digestion Authentication available. Walks you through the architecture of HTTPS, a.k.a SSL/TLC and algorithms used.<br />Fourth section is on Encoding, Internationalization and Content Negotiation.<br />Fifth section is on Content Publishing and Distribution. Types of web hosting and Publishing systems - all covered. Also allocated good deal of time on explaining Redirections and Load Balancing - very useful topic. Wraps up the discussion with a chapter on Logging and Usage tracking.<br />Last, over 100 pages of the book are all useful Appendixes.<br />If you really want to understand how the Web really works (I mean, really), this is a \\"must have\\" book.kies, Basic and Digestion Authentication available.

One example would be a &quot;CGI/Perl Cookbook&quot;. But this one is nothing like its counterpart.<br />To be able to follow the cookbook, you're expected to have a basic knowledge of Perl, Perl data structures and IO filehandles. The rest is &quot;in order to get there, do like this, because of that&quot; - style. Very easy to follow, very concise and at the same time informative. What you will appreciate the most of this book is, it doesn't just give you a solution, but it also teaches you the solution.<br />The book consists of 20 chapters, each chapter dedicated to a distinct subject, such as Strings, Numbers, Dates and Times, Arrays, Hashes, Pattern Matching, File access, File Contends and so on. Each chapter, consists of smaller sections, called &quot;Receipts&quot;. Each receipt is dedicated to a solution of one commonly encountered real-life problem.<br />For example, Receipt 8.6, &quot;Picking a Random Line from a File&quot; introduces the problem , gives a very elegant solution: &quot;rand($.) &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; ($line=$_) while &lt;&gt;&quot;, and provides a one page exciting description of the algorithm, followed by references.<br />Although I've been involved in Perl extensively for the last 3 years, I still catch myself skimming through the receipts to compare my solutions to that of the book. Frequently I end up discovering something new and exciting.<br />The book is definitely of value. Any Perl programmer should have it.	2002-11-10

Also annotates real-life examples provided in the book.<br />The chapters area well organized.<br />Chapter 1, &quot;Introduction&quot; gives a brief picture of XML, how its being used today, potentials, tools needed and validating them.<br />Chapter 2, &quot;Markup and Core Concept&quot; is definitely the heart of the book. The chapter lasts about 40 pages, and covers the core of XML and its syntax. By the end of the chapter, one can find tips to &quot;Get the Most out of Markup&quot;, and a real-life example of a DocBook, followed by annotation.<br />Chapter 3, &quot;Connecting Resources with Links&quot; talks about XLink and XPointer, the specifications you need to be able to manipulate links and locating the portions of text in a markup. Touches upon Formal Public Identified (FPI) and explains the  syntax. By the end of the chapter gives an XHTML example followed by annotation.<br />Chapter 4, &quot;Presentation: Creating the End Product&quot; is mainly about CSS and its syntax. Pros and cons are covered.<br />Chapter 5, &quot;Document Models: A Higher Level of Control&quot; is about documenting your markup through DTDs or XML Schema. Very well presented!<br />Chapter 6, &quot;Transformation: Re purposing Documents&quot; was the one I spent most of my time on, and the one I found the most valuable to be able to publish my first XML/XSLT web site (which I already did).<br />Chapter 7 and 8 are &quot;Internalization&quot; and &quot;Programming for XML&quot; respectively. In the Programming chapter, all the examples are in Perl. I didn't find this chapter that useful, but I can take as an Appendix to his &quot;Perl &amp; XML&quot; book. That's where that chapter should've belonged anyway.<br />Anyone who wants to learn XML should buy this book..

The book is definitely one of the horrible books that O'reilly was ever unfortunate enough to publish. I believe a similar title by &quot;Manning&quot; publication does a better job than this one. If you need the facts, read on.<br />If you want to purchase this book to learn how to program web graphics with Perl, stop right here and go to CPAN.org. Search for GD, GD::Graph and ImageMagick and read their manuals. That's all this book does any ways.<br />The only chapter I enjoyed was chapter one, &quot;Image File Formats&quot;, which at least taught me something I hadn't known before.<br />Outlines of the chapters follow.<br />Chapter one - &quot;Image File Formats&quot; covers most of the basics you need to know to understand the anatomy of graphics, their compression algorithms and different formats available for the web, as well as their pros and cons. This is the chapter I enjoyed most. The chapter lasts over 30 pages.<br />Chapter two - &quot;Serving graphics on the Web&quot; talks a bit about serving images from within Perl. Talks how the browser loads the images, image load time and image caching. Shows the &lt;IMG&gt; tag, and its attributes. Lasts another 30 pages.<br />Chapter 3 - &quot;A Litany of Libraries&quot; lists references to some of the graphics libraries available on the web. I would expect to see this chapter as an appendix.<br />Starting chapter 4 - &quot;On-the-Fly graphics with GD&quot; is the start of all the disappointment, and to some extent, annoyance. After a clumsy introduction to GD and some of its classes and methods, starts coding a chess board. The application itself is not so useful, but the code is worth consideration. The chapter also lists all the methods available through GD classes with some description of each.<br />Chapter 5, 6 and 7 are written in the same style as the above sibling. They concentrate on Image::Magic (also known as PerlMagick), GD::Graph (previously known as GIFgraph ) and Gimp respectively. Chapter 7 teaches how to write Gimp Plug-ins. You might consider this chapter if you're a Gimp user/fan.. They concentrate on Image::Magic (also known as PerlMagick), GD::Graph (previously known as GIFgraph ) and Gimp respectively.

The book was the first book I've read on the subject, and I'm by no means disappointed. The book is very well organized, very informative and nails the subject in the head. I am pleased.<br />I noticed some inaccuracies in the discussions, some chopped off paragraphs and sentences. But this doesn't affect the usability of the book much. Author Sean Burke does a great job in walking one through the most of the aspects of web automation and data extraction in the web using Perl and LWP (libwww in Perl ).<br />The codes the book gives are very well organized, well written and easily debugable. The steps are pretty consistent across all the examples:<br />  a) Inspect the HTML source code of the page;<br />  b) Determine the tokens and patterns of interest;<br />  c) Write the first code;<br />  d) Fine tune the code;<br />As usual, I'll be commenting on individual chapters to give you an idea of the<br />coverage of the book in more details...	2002-08-08

My first book was &quot;javascript bible&quot; by Danny Goodman, which got me started with it couple of years ago.<br />Last year, by accident, I came accross O'reilly's Safari subscription project, and decided to refresh my Javascript knowledge. One of the books I checked out was David Flanagan's &quot;Javascript The Definitive Guide&quot;.<br />I read several chapters from it, and I cought myself enjoying it more than enjoyed my previous similar titles. So I decided to buy the 4th edition of the book, and was not disappointed. So what things does David do differently? Read on!<br />I remember &quot;Javascript Bible&quot; by Danny Goodman starts off with hands on examples, which anyone without any knowledge of Javascript can try out in his/her editor. This is not the case with &quot;Javascript The Definitive Guide&quot;. If you have no idea how Javascript works, you will not see a working real-life example untill Part II (page 181). Untill then, the author explains the core syntax of javascript, how javascript interperator works, how it wraps things into two objects: while interperating - Global and Call objects; talks about variable scopes and Garbage collection, objects, arrays, operators and other good stuff. It will tell you the different between object properties and variables ( or does it say there're no differences? ), talks about Regular Expression and nested functions.<br />People who have little or no programming background tend to find this chat quite boring and meaningless ( as I would've couple of years ago ). But if you have some Javascript background, or at least know how Javascript works in the browser, and what to strengthen your knowledge of Core JS, you will find this book very informative.<br />Part || is dedicated to Client side Javascript. That's where your browser comes into play and all the fun starts. Only here it will tell you that &quot;Global object&quot; mentioned in the Core Javascvript part is called &quot;window&quot;. Talkes about CSS and DHTML, Scripting Cookies, DOM. It covers every single aspect of Client-Side JavaScript that a good Javascript book should cover.<br />The rest of the book consists of very well designed references, that you will be using most of the time.ed in the Core Javascvript part is called &quot;window&quot;.

Enjoyment started at the first chapters of the book that I read in the library's caffeteria. The book definitely covers all the  aspects of the Network Progamming, not only with Perl, but in general as well.<br />In the first chapters of the book, Lincoln Stein makes good use of such OO modules  as IO::File and IO::Socket to demostrate that difference between local file operations and  remote network programming isn't that much different at all ( at least in Perl ).<br />Chapter 2 shows you several applications that are built on pipes. The best thing about the chapter was the signals part, where L. Stein shows examples, catching all sorts of signals that your progam receives and reacts accordingly. One example was reacting to pressing of CTRL+C sequence of keys to terminate the progam.<br />I would call Chapter 3 the heart of the book, since it goes over Berkeley Sockets, the base for Network progamming in most systems, no matter what progamming language you tend to prefer. It also  explains thoroughly Sockets Addressings,  Network naming conventions, protocols, services and a lot more. This chapter, together with the Chapter 4 alone are worth the whole price of the book, I believe. The chapter  in the end goes over some common  netwook analysis tools, such as &quot;nslookup&quot;, &quot;ping&quot;, so on and so forth.<br />Chapter 4 tells you all you need about TCP Protocol. Shows several examples as well. Goes over Adjusting Socket options, and their uses.<br />Chapter 5 is not anything newer supposing you've been following all the pervious chapters. Untill this chapter, L. Stein demonstrates the coding using much low level Socket API.  here Lincoln starts using IO::Socket's Object Oriented Interface for its handy  functionalities that enable writing Networking applications more relieving.<br />Chapters 6, 7, 8 and 9 takes you through writing several commong network clients such as SMTP/mailing clients, Telnet, FTP clients. Also provides their complete source codes in case you just feel likek copying them. Chapter 9 gets into the most fun part: LWP and HTML/XML Parsing.  Spends good 50 pages on those. Very exciting indeed!<br />The rest of the book (another half) is dedicated for writing Server applications, which I haven't read. I am sure the rest is as exciting as it's been up to this point.

Bravo Jeffrey	Jeffrey Friedl's &quot;Matering Regular Expressions&quot; does a facinating job in taking you through the jungle (and I mean jungle) of RegExp.<br />I am a Perl/CGI programmer, and I had considered myself good at RegExp even before I read this book. Most of the things I knew were from Programming Perl, 3rd edition (chapter 5, Pattern Matching). But I still decided to give Jeffrey a chance since I was having some trouble with my Parse::Syntax module, which is designed to parsing *any* programming language and highlighting  the syntax accordingly (provided it has  a syntax/grammer file written for the specific language). The accuracy of the parser (and more importantly the speed) does depend on well crafted regular expressions.<br />As I started reading the book, I couldn't stop. I took it to my school's cafeteria with me and no one could make me leave untill I finished the whole book. I was excited. I was pleased! Here is the outline of tha chapters:<br />Chapter 1 and 2 introduce you to regular expressions and give some basic regex examples. Mail utility and date matching is two of them.<br />Chapter 3 mostly talks about conventions that all the regex tools follow and their differences.<br />Chapter 4 deals with Traditional NFA, POSIX NFA and DFA regex engines and their pros and cons. What you'll like the most is the details provided by the author on each and every single example. He also uses a lot of step-by-step illustrations to take you deeper into the regex engine itself and see/feel how it works. He shows the point of backtrackings and provides awesome benchmarks. He uses such examples of matching a quote, allowing escaped quotes inside the pattern, matching C-style comments, IP addresses and many more.<br />Chapter 5 deals with writing efficient regular expressions for NFA engines. It also re-vists some of the examples provided in the previous chapter and fine-tunes them.<br />Chapter 6 and 7 deals with  Tool-Language specific features of Regex engines. Chapter 6 is dedicated to Awk, Tcl and GNU Emacs, whereas chapter 7 is entirely dedicated to Perl, good  over 100 pages of Perlism.<br />It's true that there're features that Perl 5.6 offers when it comes to regex that didn't exist at the time this book went to press, (lookbehinds, for example). But this no way makes this book dated. Just take my word for it. Jeffrey put together a great masterpiece that will not die for many years, no matter how fast the technology tends to enhance<br />Haven't read anything more exciting than this for many years.hapter 6 is dedicated to Awk, Tcl and GNU Emacs, whereas chapter 7 is entirely dedicated to Perl, good  over 100 pages of Perlism. <br />It's true that there're features that Perl 5.6 offers when it comes to regex that didn't exist at the time this book went to press, (lookbehinds, for example).

The feature of the book that I liked the most was illustration servers that they build on each chapter (almost on each chapter). Every single configuration is built upon the previous one. For example, they build the first web server in chapter 2, site.toddle with just the following configuration:<br />User webuser<br />Group webgroup<br />Servername yourmachinename<br />DocumentRoot /usr/www/site.toddle/htdocs<br />Then in the following chapters they introduce different issues, and keep adding lines to the above configuration file and building seperate versions of more advanced sites.<br />However, there're several things that you might wanna be aware of before purchasing this book. Although the above mentioned feature of the book claims it's well-organized, it's not. Some of the directives just pop-up in the middle of the discussion, where they are not supposed to belong. I found that pretty annoying and confusing. I can recall the one about CERN Metafiles in chapter 3. Another annoying thing was the way they introduce directives. Consider the following lines from page 53:<br />ServerSignature [off|on|email]<br />Default: off<br />Directory, .htaccess<br />[ ...6 line description follows...]<br />Yes, it reminds me of the Apache's online documentation (which even does way better job than the above cold-blooded description). Of course, one expects more from a book than citing the online documentaion.<br />If you want to know what kind of audience the book is designed for, my answer is straightforward: I don't know, period! I have a feeling even the authors don't know anything about their potential readers. They try to get as detailed as they can where it doesn't make sence to do so. And when you expect some detail, they just ignore you.<br />I used the book as a referense during my internship, but it still didn't keep me from having to visit apache.org for more details. Now I am considering buying another book on Apache. I'll let you know :)nsidering buying another book on Apache. I'll let you know :)	2001-11-28

While there're a few boooks available on CGI/Perl, what's different in this book you'd ask. If we compare it with &quot;CGI Programming 101&quot; by Jaqueline, it's more advanced and excersices better programming style. Uses 'strict' pragma and -wT switches ALL THE TIME, which I liked a lot. The programs are also compatible in mod_perl enviroment, which prove the fluency of the authors in Perl and Web Programming. Unfortunately their those capabilities don't make them good writers. They don't spend enough time on some of the concepts they introduce. They sepend more time and space then requried on JavaScript(chapter 7), which is about 23 pages, and spend only 16 pages on Data Persistence (chapter 10). But in Data Persistence chapter they tried to cover Text files, all kinds of file lockings, temporary files, DB_File, MLDBM, SQL, DBI. Now you have a rough picture of how dEtAiLeD their topisc are. Here I'll try go over chapters with comments and will be suggesting alternatives for the topic wherever it's applicable<br />Chapter 1, 2 and 3 give some history of the WWW and CGI. Also provide a smaple CGI application for getting started. I think chapter 2, &quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol&quot; was pretty informative, and I ejoyed it a lot.<br />Chapter 4, &quot;Forms and CGI&quot; go over some form anatomy and elementary ways of encoding and decoding form input, which you might find usefull.<br />Chapter 5 is entirely dedicated to CGI.pm and it's application. I still think CGI.pm's documentation available online (or with your Perl distribution) does way better job than this one chapter.<br />Chapter 6, &quot;HTML Templates&quot; gives some nice examples of HTML::Template and Embperl usage. They spend good space on these, but only about 3 pages to cover Mason. Of course, the chapter can't take you too far without the original documentations of those mentioned libraries which are available online.<br />Chapter 7, as I mentioned was dedicated to JavaScript and JS validation. I think they were not supposed to spend so much time on JavaScript. For this one, go get JavaScript Bible, 4th edition by Danny Goodman.<br />Chapter 8, Security covers the security guidelines already available online as W3C's security FAQ by L. Stein and John Stewart.<br />Chapter 9, &quot;Sending Email&quot; was probably my favorite. It covers 'sendmai', mailx and mail and procmail. Spends good 18 pages on the topic and shows an examile that uses Mail::Mailer<br />Chapter 11, Maintaining State, was really poor. There's nothing much to learn in that chapter. For more profesional session management examples, I suggest you &quot;MySQL and Perl for the Web&quot; by Paul DeBois and Apache::Session manual available online.<br />Chapter 12, &quot;Searching the web&quot; give some advanced examples of web searching. The example of Inverted Index Search using DB_File was my favorite.<br />Chapter 13, &quot;Creating Graphics on the fly&quot; give some examples of dynamic graphic generation using GD, Image::Magick and GD::Graph. I could give this chapter hmmm... 3 stars :)<br />Chapter 14, &quot;Middleware and XML&quot; was the one I just skipped over.<br />The last 3 chapters of the book are dedicated to debugging, coding with style and eficiency with mod_perl and FastCGI.<br />For debugging and style, I recommend &quot;Programming perl 3rd edition&quot;.<br />Overall, i benefitted from the book a lot as it implies from my review.

Because the book doesn't cover all the issues in details to be able to make one a &quot;Perl expert&quot;. To achieve that goal, I recommend you to go for &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot;, &quot;Object Oriented Perl&quot; and &quot;Mastering Regular expression&quot;. Those four all together will make a &quot;perl expert&quot; out of you. The book only meets its second goal, but only partially.<br />Chapter 1 covers some basic data structure and introduces to references/pointers as they are implemented in Perl. The chapter is 22 pages only.<br />Chapter 2, &quot;Implementing Complex Data Structures&quot; does show the implementation of some complex tasks using Perl's multi-dimensional data structures. It lasts about 14 pages<br />You might find chapter 3, &quot;Typeglobs and Symbol Tables&quot; a bit usefull and more informative.<br />Chapter 4, &quot;Subroutine References and Closures&quot; was the one i Just skipped over :)<br />Chapter 5, &quot;Eval&quot; gives in depth explanation and the logick behind &quot;eval()&quot; and &quot;eval { }&quot;. Lasts about 17 pages<br />In Chapter 6, &quot;Modules&quot;, i believe there's nothing much to discover. &quot;Progamming Perl&quot; gives all the information and even much more that Sriram covers his book. Lasts 13 pages.<br />Chapter 7 and 8 cover Perl5's Object Oriented style and I found it pretty informative. I found it much better then that of &quot;Progamming Perl&quot;. But when it comes to this subject, nothing can win &quot;Object Oriented Perl&quot; by Damian Convey<br />Chapter 9, &quot;Tie&quot; is about perl's built-in &quot;tie()&quot; function and its implementation. The chapter may serve as a decent reference. But couldn't do the job better than &quot;Progamming Perl 3rd editon&quot;, Chapter 14.<br />I enjoyed Chapter 10 &quot;Persistence&quot; and Chapter 11 &quot;Implementing Object Persistence&quot;. They deal with Storable, FreeThaw, Data::Dumper, Adaptor modules. I don't know any of the books out there that cover these topics in details.<br />Chapter 11 and 12 are about Networking. They implement IO::Socket module for developping network clients, and write a Msg module for implementing &quot;Messaging Tooklkit&quot;<br />Some good Tk examples are available in Chapters 14, 15 and 16.<br />The rest of the book is dedicated to Perl's Internals and extending Perl. They use SWIG and XS toolkits.<br />So if the above sounds like what you need from the book, you can buy it, I guess. If you're just starting Perl, and not good at Perl's some advanced data structures, you won't gain anything from buying this book. Go with &quot;Learning Perl&quot; for getting started and/or &quot;CGI Programming 101&quot; if your goal is to implement Perl in Web progamming.<br />Good luckion.

If you know some Perl and some MySQL, please, DO by<br />\\"MySQL and Perl for the Web\\" by Paul DeBois and  figure out<br />how those fancy web applications out there are made and learn<br />how to be able to write one.<br />Paul's \\"MySQL and Perl for the Web\\" touches upon some topics<br />that NONE OF THE BOOKS out there ever covered in so much details.<br />The style and examples are amazing. He makes use of Perl5's Object<br />Oriented features which itself tells you that it's a professional<br />textbook for professional web-programmers.<br />The book teaches you neither Perl nor MySQL from basics. It<br />assumes you already have some basic knowledge of Perl and MySQL.<br />So it starts off at the most fun part without waisting neither his nor<br />the readers' time.<br />Here I'll go over the chapters in case the table of contents<br />don't tell you much (they didn't to me).<br />Chapter 1 and chapter 2 go over some basic things that you need<br />in order to understand and/or try out the examples in the book.<br />Chapter 2 goes over configurting your MySQL and Apache. I believe<br />if you are on a hosting service, this should've been done for you already.<br />It also teaches you to write \\"A Simple Web-Based Application - To-do List<br />Maintenance\\". Although the application doesn't require a lot of<br />brains to create, but it does cover some basic concepts that<br />you'll be using all the time in web-programming.<br />Chapter 3 gives some information on \\"Improving Performance with mod_perl\\"<br />and how to write scripts that work in mod_perl compiled servers.<br />Chapter 4, \\"Generating and Proccessing Forms\\" goes over \\"Form Anatomy\\"<br />and does introduce some concepts of \\"Form Desgin Issues\\"<br />Chapter 5, \\"Writing form-Based applications\\" is probably the wealthiest<br />chapter of the book. Following sections are available under this chapter:<br />\\"Product registration\\", \\"Using Email from Within Applications\\", \\"Running a<br />Giveaway contest\\", \\"Conducting a Poll\\", \\"Storing and Retriving Images\\",<br />\\"Electronic Greeting Cards - Send a Friend a Greeting\\".<br />This chapter lasts over 80 pages.<br />Chapter 6, \\"Automating the Form-Handling process\\" introduces some<br />concepts that you can make use of in order to automate the form handling<br />process through the use of MySQL's table metadata, which is available<br />through DESC table_name ( or SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name ) query.<br />Using his concept I introduced a new module to CPAN.org, MySQL::TableInfo.<br />Chapter 7, \\"Performing Searches\\" covers \\"Writing a Form-Based Serch<br />Application\\" and \\"Extending\\" it. It also introduces the concept of<br />\\"Link-Based Navigation\\". It also teaches you how to split the results of the search<br />over several pages; suppose you have a result of 100 rows in your search, and<br />you show only 20 results at a page, and provide [previos] and [next] links<br />so that users could navigate over your pages. Neat, isn't it?<br />Cahpter 8, \\"Session Management\\" was the one I have been wating for so long.<br />It goes over some \\"State Maintenance Techqniques\\" used in web applications, then<br />introduces the most favorite one, \\"Active Client Identification\\" method.<br />The sections the chapter covers are: \\"State Maintenance Techqniques\\", \\"Implementing<br />Session Support\\", \\"Expiring Sessions\\", \\"Storing User Prefernces\\", \\"Implementing Resumable<br />Sessions\\" and \\"When Sessions aren't enough\\"<br />Chapter 9, \\"Security and Privacy\\" teaches you the ways of precaution you could<br />take against \\"bad guys\\" ( hackers? ) to insure the security of your site/database.<br />Also shows you how to write a login page to provide access to some sensitive information<br />using the techniques he just mentioned.<br />Chapter 10, \\"E-Commerce Applications\\" covers such topics as Shopping carts,<br />credit card validation and in the end of the chapter completed a fully operating<br />commercial web-site.<br />Although the book concentrates on MySQL, I wrote several applications that make use of<br />Berkeley Database using the same techniques as Paul suggested.

There hasn't been a single CGI/Perl application (almost) of mine that  either didn't have its own constructor or inherited one.<br />So I was a true OO Perl programmer(well, that's who I thougt I was then). Still I wanted to give a try to Damian's &quot;Object Oriented Perl&quot; due to lots of positive reviews the book earned.<br />Upon buying this book I discovered so many features of OO Perl that I had been missing. I never thougt of using aythings except  reference to a hash variable as data structure for my objects (have you?).  When Damian started talking about objectifying arrays, subs, typeglobs and even *RegExp* in addition to annonymous hashes, I felt like tearing off  all the pages from my previous OO Perl tutorials and eat it.<br />I was pleased.<br />The organization of the book is quite logical as well. I found it even better than some O'reilly's Perl books (I love O'reilly), and this was my first book from Manning.<br />The author builds the base for you to get started with through the first two chapters (&quot;What you need to know first&quot; and &quot;What you need to know second&quot;).<br />The third chapter introduces you to all the basics of Object Oriented Programming in Perl, which all other tutorials out there mostly deal with. In this chapter, you build CD::Music class for managing your CDs.<br />The fourth chapter, &quot;Blessing Arrays and Scalars&quot; starts off with the  section &quot;What's wrong with a hash?&quot; Only then I discovered that hash was not  the only data structure I could use for my objects (well, not that I didn't know, but never thought of). In this chapter he also introduces to the pros and cons  of blessing arrays, pseudo-hashes, scalars and supports each with an example<br />Chapter five is even more teasing, which talks about &quot;bless&quot;ing regexps, subroutines and typeglobs.<br />The rest of the book (starting on page 168) is dedicated to standard OOP lingo, techiques and their implementation in Perl<br />Language of the book is plain english. I found some of the wordings a little different than I am used to (en-us), but doesn't effect the comprehensibility (is there such word?)  of the book at all. It was like taking couple of days off from my O'reilly books.<br />To illustrate some of the complicated structures (such as inheritance tree) the  author uses charts and diagrams. I found them really helpfull, easy to read and understand.<br />If you are into Perl, and want to get more advanced with Object Oriented features of  the language buy this book.<br />The book definitely &quot; bless $my_eyes =&gt; $OOP::Perl5; &quot;bs.<br />The rest of the book (starting on page 168) is dedicated to standard OOP lingo, techiques and their implementation in Perl<br />Language of the book is plain english.

First I got started with the mysql through the online  documentation avilable at mysql's website, which is  written and being maintained by Paul Dubois.<br />After that I decided to buy the book, and I was very satisfied with my decision. Below I am listing several evaluative criterias that indeed make the book ( and the author, as well) the best choice available thus far:<br />1) Great for beginners:  To understand how to keep a grade book, you don't need  huge brains(I hope so). That's exactly what Paul starts  his book with, and makes his way through to some RDBMS  terminologies that you won't even notice.<br />  2) From the simplest to more advanced...  Such books make the learning for beginniners piece of cake,  and for experienced ones a lof of fun.  The book's focus is on couple of tables that you build  in the first chapter, and keep manipulating throughout the book.  Paul never forgets about those tables. Even in the Second section  of the book (Using MySQL Programming Interfaces), he teaches  you to write applications using C, Perl and PHP to manipulate  them. Since you build them all together with Paul,  you have more understanding of what you're doing. Of course,  by the end of the book it gets advanced, which makes it  the right choise for advanced programmers as well.<br />3)  Great references  Oh yes. Awesome appendixes. Listings of all the functions,  keywords, syntaxes are available (in alphabetical order).  Also seperate appendixes for Perl DBI API, C API and PHP API  makes it even more useful<br />4) Easy language.  This is deginitely important. Even though the books are in  english, not all of them gurantee you comprehension.  Sometimes you might find the lingo of the book of too high a level,  or even vice versa. None of those are the cases with the MySQL  book. Paul uses plain english and switches to RDBMS lingo whenever  he thinks it is appropriate.<br />5) The book is definitely from an expert.  You better don't doubt it! Since Paul is the one in charge of the  official documentation, who else could tell you more about the subject?<br />6) Still got the gap? Let him fill it...  Another thing that pleased was the fact, unlike  other aUtHoRs, it is not hard to get hold of Paul in mysql mailing list.  He is kind enough to answer the questions, and/or contribute to the  discussions about the subject.<br />  If you are interested with learning MySql, I want you to buy the book, because there're no other books better than this one so far. Also, support for such authors is important.rom an expert.    You better don't doubt it!

The book, unfortunately, turned out to  be good for nothing! I was deceived by the &quot;ADVANCED WEBMASTER'S GURU PACK&quot; thing, which is nothing but lie. It is NOT ADVANCED, and IT IS NOT GURU PACK. Also, the quality of the book (the paper itself) is so poor, that it is not worth the price at all. I need explanation by the author why he thinks this is for advanced webmasters. I am a web programmer, and the book is definily NOT FOR ME!!!<br />Even the codes they give are very poor(they are in perl). I believe you can right advanced CGI programs without CGI.pm by Lincoln Stein. Just write your own mini CGI.pm or someething of that sort, and use it. But the book (how hard it is for me to call it &quot;the book&quot;) ignores the term &quot;modules&quot; all together.<br />They keep typing those nasty html tags.. and the algorithms they use are very poor too.<br />They don't teach you anything. The book just gives you codes, and tell you how to install it.

The book is definetely written for those who at least have some (or maybe a little more than just &quot;some&quot;) programming background, and willing to learn Perl from the author of the language.<br />I read the first edition of the book, which was about 200 pages, or something in that range, which filled my mind with nothing but questions. Current edition, however, could answer to all of those questions (well, almost). Of course, to make it answer them I had to re-read the book four times. But none of the books I currently own (and I own quite a few) could've taken me to the innards of the language so deep no matter how many times I had read them. So the book is of value.<br />The Camel book, especially, does a great job on Regular Expressions and pattern matching. If you want to learn RegEx of perl in very details, you definitely need listen to the author of Perl. &quot;Mastering Regular Expressions&quot; by Jeffrey Friedl is also a good choise, but doesn't include the latest updates.<br />Formats aren't covered very well though. So you might consider &quot;The Lama book&quot; for that (&quot;Learning Perl&quot;). Still, none of the books can tell you about the innards of the Perl in so much detail overall than &quot;Programming Perl&quot;.<br />OOP is also toched upon in the book. Since purpose of the author is not to preach you OO lingo (but plain Perl), you'll treat that part just as an intorduction to OOP and consider &quot;Object Oriented perl&quot; by Damian Convey as the next text book.<br />I found chpater 14, &quot;Tied variables&quot; very helpfull though. It might remind you of DBM/Berkley DB, through the syntax<br />tie my %db, 'AnyDBM_File', 'my_file', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0664;<br />but unfortunately it's not about DBM at all. It is about how the &quot;tie&quot; function works, and teaches you how to create your own classes for implementing with &quot;tie&quot;. After that chapter, I even had to update some of my classes and saved lots of time for their updates.<br />&quot;Compiling&quot;, chapter 18 ,is a must read chapter for those who &quot;live &amp; breath&quot; with Perl (like me, may be ?).<br />I don't want you to buy the book unless you have a good understanding of Programming or/and have knowledge of some programming languages. Otherwise, it won't help at all.<br />If your purpose is just to get started with Web applications, go for &quot;CGI progamming 101&quot; by Jacqueline Hamilton. It is a good start. But if you want to go even deeper, &quot;Learning Perl&quot; and &quot;Perl Coookbook&quot; is the next choise.

At the same time, I wouldn't call it an ideal CGI book for the reasons that I'll get into below.<br />My first CGI book was Elizabeth Castro's quick start guide, which does a good job on regex(very good job on regex) and other &quot;getting started&quot; stuff; better than this book's coverage.<br />But Jacqueline gets as deep as making use of perl modules, and creating those of your own. Even introduces mySql database manipulation with DBI, which I found very usefull. List of SSI elements in Chapter 9 is definitely worth the praise. The whole beauty of perl's taint checking is also explained thoroughly. The book doesn't cover the Formatting capabilities of perl in details, but still it's more detailed than that of Elizabeth Castro's.<br />Although CGI PROGRAMMING 101 does supply the reader with enormous useful information, in some cases I felt that I needed a little more detailed explanation of the topic. Especially her examples of using DBI and GD were lack of sufficient explanation (of course all the codes worked fine). There's a section called object orientedness(Chp 17), but don't expect much. There's nothing much to discover in there if you're concerned with OOP(except the phrase. &quot;Object Oriented&quot; in case you've never heard it).<br />If you are a little bit familiar with CGI/Perl or came from a programming background such as C, awk, seed and etc. go ahead and buy this book. If you're a novice, Elizabeth Castro's quick start guide could be a good choice (I hope). But even though you buy Elizabeth Castro's, you'll need another book after that, which probably, will be CGI PROGRAMMING 101.<br />If CGI programming is more than your hobby. After the aforementioned books, go for Larry Wall's Camel (Programming Perl), 3rd edition, which is concidered Perl's Bible (from the Perl's author).	2000-12-19

It actually doesn't intend to teach you perl from basics. What I really love about this book is, it gives a reader lots of ideas on how to use perl efficiently.<br /> Those who are hoocked on CGI can also buy this book. After buying the book you can either 1)read through it and have new ideas on how you could write perl programs efficiently or 2) just grab the ready-to-use programs from the CD and run'em.  I agree, this is not the only book that provides you with ready-to-use programs. I also wrote a review to CGI/Perl Cookbook, which got my just one star. Difference between these two titles is that, CGI/Perl Cookbook is pretty far from giving you tips and doesn't go through their ready-to-use programs in details. As to  Perl:Annotated Archives, it does a good job on  explaining the programs.  Also the programs included in the book are intended to handle some very frequent tasks, like checking HTML validity, Managing your news pages, CGI security (for details look at the table of contents in the left menu).<br />If you are beginner and want to learn perl and to be able to write your own programs and modules, I do not recommend you this title. Don't buy it. Go for either CGI101(highly recommend it) or Elizabeth Castro's Quick Start guide.<br />In overall, this is a good book, which provides you with lots of usefull ideas and programs as well.	2000-11-20

You don't need to spend money for a 656 page book for just doing that. You can download the similar scripts through internet for free even with manuals.<br />You don't learn anything from this book. If you are novice in CGI/Perl thing, go for either Elizabeth Castro's quick start guide or to Jacqueline Hamilton's CGI101. These are the best books I have ever read on CGI/Perl. If you are pretty familiar with CGI/Perl thing, I recommend you Programming Perl of Larry Wall and Randal Schwartz to get even more advanced.	2000-11-10

The book is full of examples. Lot's of examples, which is very helpful if you are a novice in Adobe Photoshop 5.5. You learn very fast. But I wouldn't say that this is the only book you'll ever need on Adobe Photoshop 5.5.<br />But it leaves the creativity to the reader. Also the weight of stock images is huge, more than needed. Almost all of the examples involve stock images (of course the CD-rom provides all the iamges mentioned). But if you are web designer, you would want a book, which gets more creative and advanced than this one, and gives you some tips on creating your own banners and nav bars. Of course, the title of the book doesn't mention that would cover this issues. But if did cover, would get my five stars. I admit, that I still learnt a lot from this book.	2000-10-30
US	49825471	R2HAL7LES5KMXZ	0072360038	765104690	Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Issues in Business Ethics and Society ( Sixth Edition)	Books	3	6	15	N	N	You don't have to read it	This book covers 19 controversial issues.  First the authors bring an issue, give some comments and give two articles that discuss the issue, but are contraversial to each other.<br />  The reason  why this book cannot get more than three stars is that the choise of articles wasn't really successful. Sometimes some of the articles seem not to make sence at all. Some of them don't answer any questions.<br />  For instance, the one about Patenting Life; second article, which keeps ripping on Rifkin (the author of the previous article) instead of discussing some of the issues Rifkin mentioned in his article against Patenting Life.It's obvious that he's for patenting lives, but he doesn't come even close to some of the issues that Rifkin talks about in his article. He just tries to avoid them because he doesn't know how to answer to those claims. The author could pick a different articles in this and many other cases as well.<br />  Also the second article of  CEO Compensation Issue doesn't make any sence. Actually, the author of the article was Lisa H. Newton herself. She asserts that CEOs do nothing but writing memos and lay offs, at the same time receiving over 47,000 times (if I remember correctly) more than other people in developing nations like Africa and Asia do, and 209 times more than his employees.Common, this is not called Ethics in Business. She doesn't face the facts brought up by the author of the article who gave pretty reasonable arguements why CEOs should get that much compensations, why they are worth it.<br />  Some of the articles do not provide with any references or sources of citations from outside sources when needed. I can mention one from Rifkin's article on patenting life.<br />  The reason why this book got three stars is that, the issues brought by authors are pretty interesting and some are thought provoking. Even though one doesn't agree with the arguements, you can still learn something by reading them, and try not to repeat some of the blunders made by the authors.<br />  I do recommend you to go for alternatives if you want a book on Business Ethics.ome of the blunders made by the authors. <br />   I do recommend you to go for alternatives if you want a book on Business Ethics.	2000-10-30

First just do whatever she asks you to; refer to the illustrations. If she asks you to type something she hasn't explained yet don't panic(it happend to me when I saw &quot;foreach(){}&quot;thing), just do what she says. She will get to it later. Just stick with her and you'll be just fine. If you want an advanced CGI book, I don't recommend this one.	2000-09-25

It taught me a lot of details of document objects, methods and so forth which are crucial in becoming a good JavaScript programmer. If from the very beginning of the book you find it kind of difficult to handle, don't give  up, procede; this is the author's method - first does a rough overview, and  later goes into more details. You might even find it helpful as I did. But  there's always a &quot;but&quot;... This book is not for those who are  totally new in programming field and have no introductory knowledge of  programming concepts.	2000-04-30
