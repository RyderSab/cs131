It gave me inspiration and some tips about interval training which increased my speed and transition tips and brick trainging which I know will greatly assist me.  As for the critique, I agree that she mentioned Danskin too much but since this is a beginning book that was her point of reference.  And, for those of us who are athletic but work a grueling schedule, I was happy to hear that if I focused or trained before work, during lunch and after work that I could adequately prepare my body.  The result of knowing that I could train a short periord of time is that I increased my training to 6 days a week and doubled the time I was training.     I've read and re-read the chapter on swimming and combined that with practice, I've seen a vast improvement in both my strokes and endurance.  I know that I will complete my triathlon and for me, this book inspired me to commit to the training and improvement.	2005-06-30

The tale is interwoven between Atiq Shaukat the prison guard and his ill wife Musarrat and Mohsen Ramat and his once progressive wife Zunaira.   We know the two stories will eventually collide and Khadra does this skillfully so that it does not feel forced or contrived.   I picked up this book because it was initially compared to a favorite of mine-The Kite Runner.  For me, the comparison was misleading statement because it is not the same type of story other than the fact that the characters all fall under the harsh regime of the Taliban.    This book stands on its own and is helpful to those of us not there in understanding the painfulness of a life left behind for one that is now under a Taliban regime.	2005-05-27

In her signature way, it's honest, interesting and she tells the story without judgement---which is why her writing is so compelling.   However, if this book had been written before Don't Let's Go, most readers would not have been compelled to read futher.   I think because it is a sort of travel log, it lacks that compelling pull of what happens next because what changes and what is learned is internal within the people in the story.  But that being said, if a reader has an interest in Africa, Fuller's life lends us a keen eye to life inside.   Read Don't Let's Go first is my only advice	2005-01-27

In fact, we had our best vegetarian meal ever---rated a perfect 10.  (The enchilada cassarole and the red curry plate).  We bought the book while there and it is just a beautiful book to remember our trip, with pictures of Kauai and interesting information about food, etc. <br /> <br />The good news is that the recipes are not too difficult and the food tastes great.  I in fact made the enchillada cassarole with some improvisation and it tasted fantastic.  I did find it to be a little more ingredient intensive then some other veggie cookbooks but certainly nothing so difficult that the dish would be ruined.   I've been learning about a few combinations too along with different ways to use tofu and tahini. <br /> <br />I wish I had a Blossoming Lotus in my town but instead I'll have to rely on my own renditions as often as I can!	2005-01-27

The two novellas are easily read as one because they intertwine together.    You need to read Franny to understanding Zooey and their quirky New York family.    The laugh out loud parts often involve the mother who as annoying as she might be reminds us that all of our families are unusual and quirky.    It's a painless introduction to Salinger in that it can be read in a few short sittings and it does make you want to read more about the Glass family escapades.	2004-07-02

What I liked was the historical perspective of the Revolution, which I did not know much about, and also the appreciation of the time in which it was written.    I was in in amored with the style which I found it very much to be a Don Quiote type of story.    I pushed to get to the end and ultimately skipped to finish.

I enjoyed the style and found it engaging as well as entertaining.     Since the premise is the sister speaking to a psychologist, I would agree with some of the comments that the berating of her jealousy at times became tiresome.   However, I did feel it was in keeping with the character that the author created as Christina.   I'm now reading Frida's letters which most of this book is based on and am amazed at how clearly I remember Frida's life from the way the book was presented.    I would call this book faction because the fictional story was based upon real facts which pulls the story through.	2004-07-02

How can a non-poet form reasonable and enjoyable poetry?   This book is the answer especially if you appreciate poetry and want to learn some forms to test your ideas.  This is the book.   It's broken down into 3 sections.  The first is a non-intimidating idea section which allows the reader to dip into his/her unconscious and come up with tons of ideas for poems and prose.  You don't start off with a poem until the next two chapters where you take ideas from the idea file and utilize them.   I mean, who knew how important a very effective title was to poetry, poets perhaps?   The last chapter discusses the particular forms and how you can revise, yes you can revise, your poems to work into a form.   This book's format was incredibly enjoyable.   After reading it once, I had several poems that I was happy with.   When I read it again, yes, this is definately a book to read more than once, I will get more ambitious and focus on forms.  This first time I just had fun.    I can see why it is recommended by teachers for students.   Or, like me, you can teach yourself.	2003-11-10

Even though I knew what each book was about, I found both Lucky and Lovely Bones riviting in their first chapters.  However, unlike Lovely Bones, I found myself skimming pages in Lucky to get to the essence of the story.  I gave it 3 stars and was contemplating 4 because I was not only compelled to finish it, but found that it stayed with me enough to discuss it with friends.  (one friend also agreed with the skimming technique to try to finish).  The book is important because Lovely Bones would probably not have been written but for Sebold getting out this story, which is in itself a very powerful story of survival.   Something to talk about. . .	2003-04-29

Messud utilizes the pen to paper as would a painter use their brush to a canvas. In both short novels----or novellas, Messud engages the reader into the full depth of a story in the shortness of 100 pages each. Unlike other reviewers, I was not prejudiced by having read The Last Life first and so disappointed with these stories. (although it sits next to me as I write because I can't wait to see more of her work). In A Simple Plan, we learn the whole life of Maria to who and what she has become today from her plight as a child. The Hunters story immediately strikes the reader without ever revealing the gender of the first person narrative. The most engaging part of both of these stories is that the language makes them come alive, almost dance off the page. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more of her work.	2003-01-24

I was skeptical, but started the book anyhow so I could at least tell him I looked at it.  I found it immediately engaging and savored every page, limiting myself to a few pages a night so I wouldn't finish it quickly.  The best part is that it is an &quot;idea&quot; writing book rather than an exercise book.  There is no stopping to jot down notes or pages with writing exercises.  Ueland gets into ideas and the psychology of why we do and don't write certain things.  It got my brain churning, and I found myself become less inhibited with a project I was trying to get to the next level on.  Excellent book for the experience writer who is feeling a need to break through to some fresh material.  Ueland is amazingly insightful and even though it is written in 1938, it does not feel dated.	2003-01-24

Immediately, the reader meets Susie Salmon who gets brutally murdered in the first chapter.  We then hear the tale through Susie's eyes from the comfort of her heaven.  The book made me ponder two questions: 1) Would the family or her friend Ruth find the killer and the key to the murder mystery?;  and 2) How did author Alice Sebold come up with such a clever and original way of telling a story?<br />I haven't been so engaged in a book since I read Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha a few years ago.  The Lovely Bones gives the reader the elements of suspense of an engaging murder mystery while making it the complex story of a family trying to survive the aftermath of tragedy.  Sebold has compelling and succinct prose.  And I would disagree with any review that argues that she tells without showing.  I had a complete picture of the town, her house, the cornfield and the characters.  I'll be interested to see what Sebold thinks of next.	2002-11-19

Laura Caldwell's carefully crafted prose makes the adventure of Casey, Kat and Sin one that every 20-something (even 30-something) can related too.  Casey utilizes job fear, boyfriend/commitment fear, friendship woes and parent-stress to catapult herself into an adventure of a lifetime.  Burning the Map goes beyond the normal hum-drum of chick-lit because Caldwell adds depth and layers to her character.  I quickly turned the pages and was very satisfied with the result.	2002-11-15

The first couple of chapters are engaging because it's interesting to learn a little about lobster fishing and small town life.  The problem is that Greenlaw does not make it 231 pages of interesting.  I found myself speed reading and skimming the last half of the book.  Some of her prose is overly simplistic, she uses short sentences in lieu of not carrying out her thoughts---or maybe there is no thought there.  She distracts the reader when she says her sister called her first book and this one a long personal ad.  After she said this, I really felt like it was.  Then, when she gets nasty and snappish with her dad, she made it clear that she really wasn't interested in finding a nice guy---that made her very unlikeable to me.  (not the man part but being a jerk generally)  Disliking her made it more difficult to finish the book.  My recommendation would be to borrow the book from someone else who mistakenly bought it---in hardcover no less!  Otherwise, read the Perfect Storm again if you want an excellent book on fishing and adventure.	2002-09-28

I thought it had many good ideas for inspiring writing and getting the creative process flowing; however, I found none of them novel.  I am not only a voracious reader but also avid attender of writing classes and workshops.   I earmarked this book at the top of my list because I thought that the reviews were great and the title was clever.  I was immediately inspired and excited to get into the book.  Once I started the book, I realized that I would have preferred to read a bit more before I stopped to workshop.  For me, the exercises became tedious and it was difficult to continue my flow from book to paper.  I suppose for the beginning writer who has never taken a workshop, this book may be a great introduction and very helpful.  If you have taken many workshops you may find the process cumbersome if not remedial.  I was too frustrated to finish the book and am taking another writing workshop class instead.	2001-10-29

This book somewhat dispells the notion that Geisha are merely Japan's version of a high class &quot;call girl.&quot;   The Geisha are much more than that even though there is money in exchange for their companionship or entertainment.  As a fast reader, this book did take me a long time to finish.  I attribute this to the fact that the book combines history and story so the reader needs to focus on the information in order to fully understand concepts and move forward.  I describe it as wading through chocolate pudding, entirely enjoyable just slow.	2001-07-30
US	50168686	R1SBUKP9OK88S9	0385720211	517893800	In the Drink: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Summer Beach Read	The writing was contemporary and engaging which is what drew me into the book besides the Amazon recommendation.  Definately not a Brigid Jones wanna-be, Claudia Steiner is a raw, ragged, socially acceptable drunk that all women can relate to on some level.  She's also a New Yorker but definately not the sexy glam Sex in the City style.  You might think of Claudia as a loser but you like her just the same.  As enjoyable as the story was, I did find it slightly depressing at times because Claudia is slightly suicidal, at a minimum depressed.  Mostly, I found the read quick and engaging, enjoying the structure, word choice and brillant use of simile.  My only complaint was that I felt that the last few chapters were a quick wrap up, rather than the flowing crisp style that gets the reader into the book.  What finally comes about about William is not believeable.  It is a great book to bring to the beach or read on the way to work because it is quick, witty and smart.  A chapter at a time is just enough but you may want to do what I did and find an hour or so to finish those final chapters together.	2001-06-14

Yoshimura lets the reader ponder and wait through many pages before you find out why this seemingly gentle mannered former school teacher named Kikutani obtained a life sentence in prison.  I enjoyed this element of suspense and found it continued throughout the book making it not only clever but compelling.  Certainly, knowing that this book is a japanese translation, you still get a distinct flavor not only for the author and his style but the japanese culture through the eyes of Kikutani.   Kikutani is a character that the reader neither totally likes nor dislikes.  The story unfolds through his experience reintegrating his life back into society.  His fears are sometimes suprising.  And, I wonder if the severe embarrassment of his crime and punishment is enhanced by the japanese culture itself and the distinct element of privacy.  The attention to detail lets the reader explore this culture through Kikutani's eyes.  We see his transformation in the story including the reader's almost shocking discovery that he has absolutely no remourse for his crime.  All this leads to a very satisfying ending only because it fits with the story. Yoshimura is one of the premier authors in Japan, which attracted me to this book, and this is an excellent sample of his work, which is precise, detailed, clever and distinctive.	2001-05-17

I've read a few of his books including Needfull Things and The Bachman Books and didn't care for the length or the gore.  However, I can respect his writing in addition to his readership that spans the world.  I was curious about this book, and wondered if it would help me to write that great american novel.  I skimmed the book more for writing information rather than his personal accounts, some of which i found interesting.  I did pick up helpful tips for my writing.  Changing the gender of a character is an important tip and will definatly help my writing block.  This is just one of a few tips in this book.  Mr. King is a facinating character himself and reading how he made Misery or Carrie will definately help me with my own character sketches.  And, after reading this book, I think I am going to try reading one of his novels again and be able to use a more critical eye to the style.  So, even if you don't care for his books at all, reading or skimming this book can give you a new appreciation for his creativity and authorship.  Thank you Mr. King!	2001-03-15

Reading thisbook last, I thought is was not as &quot;raw&quot; as the shocking andhorrific stories told of Dave's abuse in the first two books.  It wasobviously more crafted and skillfully edited by his wife Marsha, whomyou read about in this book.  Although at times found myself skimmingsome pages to get to the important parts, this book is a must read. Atsome points it summarized points in the other books, which Iunderstand is necessary if this book is to be read first.  Certainlyyou could read this book without reading the others because of thesynopsis; however, the rawness of the beginning stories is what Ifound most compelling as a reader.  Either way, Dave's story isinspriational and important.	2001-01-30

I think I read that it was the third worst case of child abuse in California.  You see David as a small, if not scrawny child, that lives in constant fear of relentless beating and torture which happen on a daily basis: he must eat feces, rancid meat, inhale and injest toxic substances, and his own brothers kick and beat him as well.  Sadly, his mother is so controlling that even his father  cannot protect him against her rath.  The book stays with you for much longer that it takes to read.  My only critique would be that although the book states that it is from a child's viewpoint, I thought that it floated in and out of the child's voice and often read from a much older person's viewpoint.  I recognize that this is a minute point and that it is an extremely difficult task to write a book like this let alone remain in the child's voice the entire time.  Finally, this book is inspiring, compelling as well as gut wrenching.  David Pelzer is a commendable and inspiring survivor that we can all learn something from.	2001-01-22

I found this book sometimes overly detailed and longwinded, almost like she was trying to fill a certain page number.  I found some of the subplots of the characters unbelieveable if not underdeveloped.  Although I did like Marino, who reminds me of NYPD Blue's Andy Sipowitz, his color came across in this work.  I finished this book partially because i was on a long plane ride and partially because I thought something was going to happen.  I would definately give this author another chance but I cannot recommend this book, especially if you are new to the author, you might not want to start with one of the first novels of Kay Scarpetta.	2001-01-17

I think that Kellyanne would tell you that you just have to believe.  But it ends up being her unbelieving brother Ashmol that gets the town to believe when Pobby and Dingan get lost at the mines.  Pobby and Dingan is a sweet surprise, a fun story book that you might read with your older kids or a gift for a friend who has gotten ....... into the corporate world without air.  It's short, it's imaginative and unpredictable even given it's length.  I loved that the book was set in austrailia and utilizes aussie terms like pom and fairdenkum and that I could listen to the accent between the pages.  It's a story book, nothing more nothing less.  I wouldn't anxiously await a next book by Ben Rice, but, fairdenkum, this one was a super surprise.	2000-12-12

The first 30 pages grabbed my attention because of pure quality of the writing, every word, every sentance is carefully crafted so that they dance off the pages.  After my excitement calmed about the writing I allowed myself to enjoy the story.  Although not a fan of the Hollywood &quot;older man meets 30ish girl&quot; genre, I enjoyed the story and the development of the characters.  The fact that it is a novella is perfect, I didn't want to read any more about the story, just to absorb the style. Mostly, Steve Martin's work is important for the simple truth that he is a gifted writer.  Look for his articles in the archives of the New Yorker.	2000-12-12

A sucker for a good novel about serial killers, I thought the book was engaging and I got deep within the characters.  My complaint is always that a book like this is easy to digest but leaves you still wanting more.  If you are a thriller junkie you will love this book even if you haven't read any of his other books.	2000-11-07

I would recommend this book as a summer or travel read only.  At times it reminded me of a harlequin romance novel that I read in my teens. I nearly put the book down after 50 pages or so because of the lack of element of surprise but it continued to give me a glimmer of hope that it would get better.  I had to give it a 3 because I did indeed finish the book, but if I were on a plane on a long trip I would be happy to have it and then trade it away.	2000-11-06

I totally enjoyed the book and found it hard to put down.  Initially only remembering that it was about a little girl and a spelling bee, I was engaged and engrossed by the sub-plots of each family member.  Myla Goldberg does an excellent job of making you care deeply for Eliza as you see the story unfold mostly through her eyes.  The fact that the family is devoutly jewish adds another facinating and critical element to the story that I absolutely embrased from my own personal experience of growing up devoutly catholic.  This book is not only a worthwhile read, but leaves you with something that you can keep, if only in your heart.	2000-10-26
