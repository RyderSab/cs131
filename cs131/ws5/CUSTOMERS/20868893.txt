It's been several years since I first read \\"River - Horse: A Voyage Across America\\" and it's the haunting sense of the very essence of America, that's stayed with me. As an experienced mariner, I find the setting is brilliantly evoked. I loved the deliberate slow pace (appropriate to how things may have felt for the early explorers, and subsequent settlers), rich detail, and strong sense of the characters.    It's amazing how deep a sense of people and place can be developed by completely immersing oneself in the life of a town. This is why the best true adventure books work so well--because you are able to learn so much, including details you wouldn't at first expect to know, such as what people are most likely thinking, and feeling. This is certainly among the very best true adventure works that depict the very essence of America, her people, and places.    As an intelligence officer, my proposals for updating the intelligence community have frequently been deemed radical. However, in lieu of the current world situation, anything short of radical won't do. American university students interested in a career in intelligence should replicate the travel, reflection and documentation along foreign rivers similar to Heat-Moon's River- Horse experience. This would generate a solid base of human intelligence \\"area experts\\" that our nation desperately needs (hopefully, along with good will and understanding).     Most true adventure books are about the past. This one is about the future. Integrating a profound knowledge of America, her people, and interior layout Heat-Moon's work brilliantly charts what HUMINT Area Experts in the intelligence community must do to remain relevant in this century of change.	2005-08-10

For students of the history and evolution of intelligence and it's major players, ISRAEL'S SECRET WARS is one of the best comprehensive surveys of the subject available. Messer's. Black and Morris provide a balanced, thoughtfully researched, and well-written account of the complex world of intelligence operations. <br /> <br />The concluding points taken are poignant, and pithy.  <br />o Israel has consistently been good at human intelligence, the oldest form of spycraft, which remains, despite sophisticated surveillance satellites, computer cryptanalysis and the other vast technological advances of recent years, the best way to find out what an enemy is doing, thinking and planning.  <br />o The classic ideological spy, motivated by a belief in the system of his country's enemy, does not exist in the Middle East conflict. There are no closet Arab Zionists, no Syrian, Iraqi, Egyptian or Palestinian Kim Philbys who believe that the transformation of Palestine into Israel, the dispossession and partial exile of an Arab people, is a good and positive thing. <br />o Ingenuity, ruthlessness and dishonesty have played their part in this history, as they have done, and continue to do, to a greater or lesser degree, in the work of all intelligence and security services everywhere. <br />o Israel's secret services have always gone far beyond the traditional tasks of espionage and counter-espionage. Early operational versatility - was carried over {from the British}into the years of independence. <br />o Obtaining weapons and advanced technologies secretly, and often illegally, and denying them to enemies remain a preoccupation. <br />o Using the media to disseminate stories and warnings that help Israeli operations and undermine the country's enemies has long been a speciality. <br />	2005-07-14

This book focuses not only on integrating the highly complex issues associated with maritime security, but also on the sensitive problem of incorporating imagination to acquire foresight into future threats. As Mr. Hawkes points out, quality intelligence remains a matter of high priority. \\"...protective measures ...must be capable in all instances of performing two absolutely imperative tasks. They must provide timely and accurate warning of an impending threat, and they must be capable of removing or neutralizing that threat by repelling, capturing, or killing those persons whose actions or intentions constitute it.\\" P 9.<br /><br />As an excellent example of the methodology for maritime intelligence and special operations, Maritime Security presents a clear, consequential, and linear picture of how properly planned performance can avert disaster. \\"In-depth security establishes multiple security perimeters or lines of defense through which an attacker, saboteur, hijacker, or other criminal must penetrate... All of the awareness, planning, and preparedness a manager or master may bring to bear is of no value whatsoever if, when the chips are down, people fail to act. Timely reaction cannot exist, by definition, in the absence of action. In order for a crew to act it must be commanded by a master willing to be decisive, and it must have trained to the point where action is almost instinctive.\\" P 11-13.<br /><br />This book deserves the highest praise for elaborating on principles and insisting on quality control, and is written with a love of the industry in general and the special people involved in particular. Hawkes is obviously one of the small class of maritime intelligence operators who have actually been there. \\"Two of the toughest security policy decisions faced by any maritime organization involve the employment of security forces and the arming of those forces...If...the threat is not known, but is should reasonably be known, it is negligence (the law doesnot accept the head-in-the-sand excuse). Once the security threat is recognized or should have been recognized, the maritime operator has a duty under the law to provide reasonable security...Contingency planning and crisis management policies go hand in hand. The key to both is foreseeability...One effective contingency planning tool that can be utilized at various organizational levels is the practice of gaming.\\" P 232-233.<br /><br />Managers, and commanders cannot ignore the kind of rigorous analysis this book offers without diminishing their efforts and responsibility to provide adequate security.	2005-07-13

Yes, Informing Statecraft: Intelligence for a New Century is relentlessly critical of the blundering past performance of various administrations, e.g., \\"Note well that liberals in America, when in charge of government at any level, of university faculties, or of CIA directorates, take care to hire and award contracts to likeminded folk and to exclude others.\\" P 231.    And, yes the aphorisms are authentic, fascinating, and call for radical reformation e.g., \\"Sound knowledge of a disorderly world, rather than faith in a trouble free, post-end-of-history `new world order,' will best fit nations to thrive in the twenty-first century.\\" P 72. \\"There is never enough intelligence to guarantee instant success at no cost and never enough to overcome entrenched prejudice.\\" P 213. \\"It is more important to define what any particular job, e.g., espionage, is to accomplish, how it is to be accomplished, and to hire the right kinds of people to do it, than it is to decide for which bureaucracy these people will work.\\" P 293.    But the roots of this work lie deep in lessons that humankind desperately needs to understand now at the beginning of the new millennium: the mystery of foreign lands and the mystery of the language, culture, and people integral to them.  o Despite superficial signs of a uniform world culture (cassette recorders, jeans, soda pop, burgers, rock groups), Africans are becoming more African, Asians more Asian, Russians more Russian, etc. The often astonishingly good English spoken by young people from Moscow to Mecca  - never mind the Indian subcontinent, where it is the lingua franca - has led many U.S. analysts to the disastrous conclusion that foreigners can be understood in terms of what they say in English. On the contrary, their English words are our symbols, to which they do not necessarily attach the same meaning or convictions we attach. P 239.   o The characteristics of the person sent to gather information often make the difference between information that is useful and information that is worse than useless. P 301.  o The network is most important. Closed terrorist cells in the Middle East are part of the semiopen entourages of terrorist chieftains who are part of overt Palestinian politics in which Arab governments take major parts. P 311.  o Among the most effective forms of propaganda is the propaganda of the deed-the sight of a corpse, and the feeling that one may be next. Nothing so cements a movement for the long run as martyrs, nor changes a government so definitively as killing its members or supporters. P 375.    After my first reading of Informing Statecraft, I read it at random, and find that no matter where I pick up the thread, it produces a comprehensively researched and unrivaled account of the intelligence industry. As always, Codevilla navigates the shoals of this information with great skill and dexterity.	2005-07-11

This work may be best suited for students of Criminology who are required to demonstrate their knowledge and skill in conducting their own research somewhere along the continuum from Community Oriented Policing to Intelligence Led Policing. The highly academic style is replete with methodical concerns, including the value of empirical evidence, and research jargon such as regression analysis, correlation of variables, etc. <br /> <br />Although the book was prepared essentially as a peer review of the earlier works of the proponents of the `Broken Windows' theory, the real value may be in its recognition of the shallowness of strictly quantitative analysis. \\" The important methodological point is that, once we have taken the `social meaning turn' - and I believe we must- quantitative correlations between enforcement and crime will no longer be sufficient. ...The study of social meaning calls for the integration of qualitative and quantitative methods, and integration which is being increasingly reflected in the social sciences today. From political science and sociology to program evaluation in psychology, there is a growing movement to overcome the traditional paradigm war, and to increase the amount of information brought to bear on hypotheses.\\" Pp 110-114. <br /> <br />This is an essential read for the serious student of modern police methods. <br />	2005-04-14

NYPD Battles Crime recognizes that by admitting things are not \\"all right\\", that there are problems waiting for solution, we can move onto what may be reasonable and realistic remedies to the crisis at hand. \\"It was hard to argue that averting crime, even nuisance crime or incivility, before it erupts is better than reacting to ongoing, more violent criminal activity.\\" Pp 79-80.     The three main objectives for an Intelligence Led campaign in law enforcement where a serious or increasing degree of criminal threat is perceived, which is what Compstat is really all about are as follows.    Government officials must begin by eliminating perceived injustices. Previously, and even more so today, the inequalities of cultures must be studied, and understood within the context of the indigenous perspective i.e., avoid mirror imaging. It is vital that western democratic policymakers have adequate intelligence so as not to underestimate security challenges. The disparity between Western material and technological advantages with those of opposing cultures defines the crises.    \\"The NYPD and organizations emulating its successes are undergoing a revolutionary change - a new way of relating to their environment.\\" P 186.    Law Enforcement Intelligence must also focus on the emerging domestic threat generated, and propelled by the multicultural mentality that renders logical decisions impossible. This particular `group-think' mentality espouses inexplicable virtue on non-Western societies whom proudly profess a real threat. It is the essence for fostering unconventional warfare, terrorism, and globally organized crime.    Prior to Compstat ...\\"An assemblage of field soldiers and officers, as in the first act of Aida, would deliver on the top command's promise to dramatically reduce crime. But the stumbling of previous reform administrations on a stage replete with bureaucratic land mines and social `snafus' had shown the need for more deftness and sophistication in reconfiguring the NYPD bureaucracy.\\" P 82.    Almost simultaneously, the government must obtain support of the local citizenry, separating the criminal threat from the general population, as much as possible, both physically and psychologically.     Strategic policy should consider when implementing a counterinsurgency campaign against criminality and incivility that personnel develop a sincere empathy for the public they serve. When forces are scattered among, and living with, the population, they need not be told any longer that they have to win their support. Being more vulnerable, they realize instinctively that their own safety depends on good relations with the local people. Civil, respectful behavior will come about naturally on their part.     Finally, law enforcement must develop the necessary intelligence to establish a policy whereby future criminality will not threaten the newly established civility. There are plausible reasons to believe that the majority of citizens support or are at least sympathetic to the counterinsurgent forces. However, the residents in a high crime/combat area usually avoid contact with them. The barrier between the lawful citizen and the counterinsurgent must be broken. Fostering a sense of self-preservation should dissolve the separation between the counterinsurgent and law abiding citizen. Too often residents fear reprisals from the criminal element and with good reason doubt there is adequate defense from counterinsurgent forces. Only when the tables are turned; when the counterinsurgents hold the upper hand on controlling violence, and only after the local resident has been adequately enabled to control his own safety will there be open communication between the counterinsurgents and citizens.    This work with its historical depiction of how Compstat was developed is very helpful in studying and understanding Intelligence Led Policing.	2005-04-13

The Hidden Connections employs inductive and deductive processes that includes the predominate traits in the character and cognition of individuals and the notion of life, the effective character of influential groups, and the coalescence of individual and group desires when people respond to various stimuli. Capra refers to this as `The Dynamics of Culture'. It is a very well researched, primarily academic treatise on the science of sustainability. <br /> <br />\\"Our ability to hold mental images and project them into the future not only allows us to identify goals and purposes and develop strategies and designs, but also enables us to choose among several alternatives and hence to formulate values and social rules of behavior...The social network also produces a body of knowledge-including information, ideas, and skills-that shapes the culture's distinctive way of life in addition to its values and beliefs...This meaningful knowledge, continually modified by the network of communications, is passed on from generation to generation together with the culture's values, beliefs, and rules of conduct.\\" Pp 85-87. <br /> <br />There are numerous worthwhile lessons that can be gleaned from this work. Capra's study improves the analyst's ability to understand various peoples and to apply the concept of character to practical problems in intelligence and security relations and helps to avoid the common pitfalls of `mirror imaging'.  <br /> <br />Among others, those who are interested in national security and law enforcement intelligence gain a clearer understanding on the meaning of the term `sustainability' and of related terms and concepts so often encountered in organizational studies and in intelligence readings. This should also serve to turn the light on for policymakers.  ...\\"the original meaning of `authority' is not `power to command,' but `a firm basis for knowing and acting' ...the origin of power, then, lies in culturally defined positions of authority on which the community relies for the resolution of conflicts and for decisions about how to act wisely and effectively. In other words, true authority consists in empowering others to act.\\" P 89. <br /> <br />\\"It is common to hear that people in organizations resist change. In reality,  people do not resist change; they resist having change imposed on them. ...Moreover, it will help us design business organizations that are ecologically sustainable, since the principles of organization of ecosystems, which are the basis of sustainability, are identical to the principles of organization of all living systems.\\" P 100. <br />	2005-04-13

It is inherently dangerous work and because we never know when, where, or how the crisis will occur we must prepare for the inevitable event. \\"By its very nature, a survival situation, like life itself, comes upon you unexpectedly. So, only if a life is lived in its entirety as an act of survival can you have a hope of finding correct action at the moment of crisis. Survival is a path that must be walked from birth to death. It is a way of life.\\" P. 238. <br /> <br /> In Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why there are two important points as to what constitutes a `survivor'. First, it delineates what are the elements of  `the right stuff'. Second, it describes what we can do to maximize our potential to acquire and develop these qualities. The material is applicable to all of life's trials and tribulations. I can attest firsthand to the value of these lessons.  \\"...typical of the best survivors. To revere pain and fear, to embrace friction, are bedrock skills of survival...lead ascetic lives of denial and service...learn to function as a team, to value their brothers and sisters above their own lives and to protect them. They learn to become intimate with fear and pain, to make fear and pain tools of their salvation. They train for years and years...\\" P. 239. <br /> <br />The training is geared to what field officers need to know to be able to cope with the stresses and strains of both physical and psychological challenges. The training is not all physical, but involves much intensive academic study as well as hands-on application of the skills taught.  \\"If you've tallied a lot of experience in dangerous, iffy environments without significant calamity, the mental path of least resistance is to assume itwas your skill and savvy that told the tale...Experience is nothing more than an engine that drives adaptation, so it's always important to ask: Adaptation to what? You need to know if your particular experience has produced the sort of adaptation that will contribute to survival in the particular environment you choose. And when the environment changes, you have to be aware that your own experience might be inappropriate.\\" P. 113. <br /> <br />This approach gives operatives the skill and confidence to remain cognitive while surviving under varying environmental conditions. \\"Ultimately, it is the struggle that keeps one alive. What seems a paradox is simply the act of living: Never stop struggling. Life itself is a paradox, gathering order out of chaos of matter and energy. When the struggle ceases, we die.\\" P. 206. <br /> <br />This work is a well-researched contribution to understanding SERE doctrine in its broadest sense. Thus, Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why should be uppermost on every law enforcement commanders reading list for fieldcraft. <br />	2005-03-10

To Prevail is a compendium of works by eminent scholars and practitioners who stress the importance of understanding the distinct changes in the threat to U.S. security, and debunk the myths created and circulated by the ignorant and uninformed.  Historically, we have viewed the threat to our national security as being associated with a government, linear in development, in accordance with well-understood rules of engagement, and an enemy whose tactics, weapons, and assets were relatively easy to detect and recognize. <br /> <br />There are a number of identifiable security threats-drug trafficking, terrorism, proliferation of WMD-which constitute a `clear and present danger'. As long as human discontent, and/or greed exist, fanatics and killers will be globally recruited. By using 9/11 as a reason, `causas-belli' to target not just the terrorists themselves but countries that harbor them, the Bush administration has created a major precedent. This does not amount to a foreign policy of carte blanche; but it does mean that the United States and other Western countries can coerce belligerents and rogue states to crack down on terrorists, or take other preemptive action. That's the new order of things. <br /> <br />The intelligence community, which has gone into a lamentable decline since the Carter administration, is primarily deficient in handling the new world order in special operations personnel, linguists, and operators/analysts with in-country experience due to an over reliance on technological surveillance.

Historically, we have viewed the threat to our national security as being associated with a government, linear in development, in accordance with well-understood rules of engagement, and an enemy whose tactics, weapons, and assets were relatively easy to detect and recognize. <br /> <br />Changes in perspective should be viewed in response to the caveats of where and/or who constitutes the crises; why is intelligence so important; what is the nature of intelligence work, and how does intelligence in low intensity operations integrate with the new world order-or disorder? <br /> <br />First, where and/or who constitute the crises? Today life is full of crises-governmental crises, financial crises, personal crises-that are all competing for attention. Catastrophic crises, such as floods, earthquakes, and disease compete for resources side-by-side with military and non-state insurgencies. Terrorism and globally organized criminal syndicates command the attention of both foreign and domestic intelligence organizations-civilian and military-for redress on the issues of security and order. The parameters however, of all the crises listed above meet the conditions and definitions of low intensity conflict. <br /> <br />Many politicians, academicians, and media representatives erroneously contend that crises are the result of cataclysmic events, and evolutionary forces that are neither predictable nor avoidable. Additionally, the nuclear preoccupation of the past is a poor guide to the pressing security concerns of today. Time-consuming multilateral diplomacy including peacekeeping and stability operations and protracted low intensity conflict e.g., the global war on terrorism, Haitian insurrection, etc, not the dynamics of a rapidly developing confrontation between major powers, are this nation's most pressing threats. It is in this arena that the demands for adequate intelligence will be made. It is with an educated population that we may rise to meet the challenges for world peace. <br /> <br />Written with both insight... \\"Without the hungry car-and American demands for the gas to feed it-pumps wouldn't creak in the desert, tankers wouldn't leak off Jidda, warships wouldn't be parked in the Gulf, American soldiers wouldn't be stationed at desert bases...\\" P.87; and humor... \\"THIS WON'T HURT A BIT!

September 11 was the impetus for an awareness of world order, or disorder, depending on where you stand.<br /><br />To argue that fighting terrorism perpetrated by a handful of Islamic fundamentalists equates to all Muslims as potential enemies is absurd. Nevertheless, ideologically based terrorism that includes religious terrorism, is hard to eliminate due to holding appeal to a wider section of the population. If there really is a specifically Islamic challenge to the West that repudiates its values, often resorts to violence and appears to be growing in strength, then the intelligence system had better adapt.<br /><br />The objective as described in detail within Culture Matters, is to achieve containment by limiting the appeal of the extremists to their likely sympathizers, as total elimination is neither practical nor desirable.<br /><br />This volume is comprised of individual works by esteemed social scientists, journalists, and practitioners from around the world on such issues as the `Moral Imperative'; e.g.<br /><br />\\"There are three basic levels of morality...The lowest is criminal-disregard for the rights of others and the law...In development-favorable cultures, there is widespread compliance with laws and norms that are totally exigent and are therefore realizable. Moral law and social reality virtually coincide. In development-resistant cultures, on the other hand, there are two worlds that are out of touch with each other. One is the exalted world of the highest standards and the other is the real world of furtive immorality and generalized hypocrisy. The law is a remote, utopian ideal that does little more than express what people might in theory prefer, whereas the real world, effectively out of touch with all law, operates under the law of the jungle, the law of the cleverest or the strongest, a world of foxes and lions disguised aslambs.\\" P 48.<br /><br />\\"The challenge ahead is the need for global civizational dialogue as a prerequisite for a peaceful world order.

As much an autobiography as a text on the sequel to the Cold War, Count de Marenches' The Fourth World War: Diplomacy and Espionage in the Age of Terrorism underscores the theory that efficacious intelligence addresses current problems of criminal insurgency including acts of terrorism, asymmetric warfare, and low intensity conflict and suggests possible solutions. It introduces the notion that the Cold War, an East-West conflict has been transformed into a South-North War fueled by the `pressures of population, hunger, disparate religious beliefs, historic prejudices, and hatreds' that results in criminal insurgency. Consequently, a new paradigm (Certain Destruction as opposed to Mutually Assured Destruction) may be developed that could assist practitioners and academics alike in analyzing, solving and managing the threat. By shifting the perspective for both military and civilian forces from their traditionally reactive stance, to a proactive posture, and merging national security with homeland defense on the most perplexing issues and threats facing U.S. security, this work may provide a base upon which new and actionable policies can be designed.     As a career intelligence officer and former head of the Direction Gnrale de la Scurit Extrieure, Count de Marenches perceptively warns that public administrators take seriously the lessons from past failures. The single most important supposition being, sound policy is reliant upon good intelligence. \\"We have many weaknesses that terrorist organizations, through their flexibility, are repeatedly able to exploit. One key weakness is that we continue to think of defense fundamentally in national terms, whereas terrorism operates in an international or global context, moving at will across frontiers, choosing targets carefully where opportunity presents itself rather than for any specific nationalist end.\\" P. 199.	2005-01-17

Ms. Malkin cogently expresses her insight that law enforcement intelligence must successfully incorporate tasks, functions, and controls beginning with communication with consumers during the planning & direction phase of the intelligence cycle. Western, and particularly U.S. culture encourages personal initiative, the challenging of conventional wisdom, and the development of creative solutions to the inevitable conflicts and contradictions that occur within the competitively pressured environment of both the civilian law enforcement and military intelligence communities. <br /> <br />Therefore, it is incumbent on leadership steeped in personal courage to deliver intelligence products that address the internal-operational, and tactical-needs, with policymaking consumer's needs-strategic-and resolve the continuing dilemmas, inconsistencies, and subversions attributable to influences including, but not limited to, the media, special interest groups, and the changing times. <br /> <br />The character of the immigrant population living within our borders has changed, as has their motives for being here.

Striking at the very heart of morality and legality, domestic insurgent acts of self-interest such as those, which result in reverse discrimination, inequitable distribution of property, and sundry other self-serving interests are subversive to the very notion of the rule of law. \\"The hallmark of the politics and economics of tyranny is cronyism...Arguing about what interest group gets what is conducive neither to prosperity nor to civility...Nothing so affects economic life, civic life, or, for that matter, family and spiritual life as whether the rulers are bound by law or rule by discretion\\" Pp. 8-11. The Constitution provides for equitable and impartial treatment. Nowhere does it forecast a need for special protections of specific groups looking for social advancement and financial gain. <br /> <br />The good news is that there are a growing number of informed individuals, Dr. Codevilla included, that are willing to step forward and profess their understanding of the reality of our leniency towards sensitive issues that affect our national security for the sake of political expediency.  The combined effect of \\"...who gets what, where, and how, and at whose expense, as well as questionsabout which classes of people are to be somehow `protected,' subsidized, or entitled, also naturally lead to combat\\" cannot be overlooked for their seriously damaging long-term ramifications for global political and economic stability and ultimately US security. <br /> <br />This is the best book for those ready to step-up-to-the-plate, and campaign for change that really matters in the fight for freedom. <br />	2005-01-14

Messer Frost and Morris delineate the key elements of \\"quality\\" intelligence. Quality requires prioritizing within each segment of the intelligence cycle-planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination- balancing judgment in decisions using improvisation, freshness, and often quite original re-conceptualizations of the problem to find answers that are relevant to broadly understood issues. The intelligence product needs to integrate meaningful information, adding value from diverse sources, including knowledge of people, technology, culture, and current political/military strategies. Rather than using tried and true solutions, simplistic maximizations, or well-honed and comfortable decision rules, intelligence professionals need to employ creative and adaptive methods of collection and analysis suited to the unique features of the problem.<br /><br />Realizing there may be no 100% guaranteed right answer, or in most cases, even an answer that will endure, the intelligence community must seek to integrate a variety of scenarios (game theory) with their particular goals and strategies. Therefore, outstanding intelligence will be highly creative in identifying significant patterns from diffuse, tangled data and information. As has been recently determined, the benefit of intelligence lies in problem finding as opposed to problem solving, whereby problem finding depends upon uncovering trends, patterns, and interrelationships when they are not readily apparent and/or intentionally hidden from others.<br /><br />Therefore, the sub-elements of `Quality' are:<br /><br />· Timeliness. The intelligence product must reach the consumer at the time of its<br /><br />greatest inherent usefulness. Within every level of consumption-strategic, operational, and tactical-there lies a unique and temporary combination of circumstances. A decision and subsequent action that is delayed is often rendered ineffective because the circumstances have changed.<br /><br />· Accuracy. The merit of intelligence is dependent on the same principals as any<br /><br />other academic, scientific, or professional endeavor, i.e. reliability and validity. The conclusion, in terms of precision or probability for recommended policy must have a high propensity for replication with the same results if reexamined. The primary criteria in evaluating either a document or oral testimony is the degree of reliability of the source, from which the information was obtained. Additionally, the information must address the actual subject at hand-validity. In other words, are we examining that which we intended to examine, as opposed to irrelevant phenomena? The intelligence industry utilizes the Modified Admiralty System to grade information in response to these issues.<br /><br />· Relevance. The desirability of intelligence products today emanate from a wealth<br /><br />of fluid complexities and the analyst's ability to discern fact from assumption and then give it meaning. Within the context of low intensity conflict-transnational in scope, insurgent in nature, and asymmetrical in form-many quantitative and qualitative evaluations of certain aspects of the enemy's behavior, which appear to be numerically precise, are in fact number games that add up to precisely nothing. No statistical index or quantitative variable can properly be attached to some essential attributes of the enemy, e.g. surprise, deception, and mobility. Therefore, new means of measuring the relevance of the evidence must be explored.<br /><br /> This is a MUST read for any student or professional with interest in law enforcement intelligence.	2005-01-14

This book explains why we need to make some strategic changes in order to achieve a higher level of national security. It does not anatomize intelligence or devote many pages to predictions of crises. It does not document at length what has been proven in time-that Americans rely too heavily on quantitative as opposed to qualitative constructs. It takes no position about methods of collection beyond insisting that content must receive as much emphasis as `technical sophistication'. It does not discuss bureaucracy, funding, or government oversight. In fact, one of its major purposes is to separate itself from what the `best and brightest' espoused in their quest for policy based on quantitative and statistical analysis. <br /> <br />It focuses on what I perceive to be the most important, and fundamental forms of intelligence-knowledge, organization, and activity.  I believe that it reveals the very essence of intelligence so compellingly that anyone connected with the American intelligence community will be enthralled with the book's message and compelled to act upon it. <br /> <br />This book along with Washington Platt's Strategic Intelligence Production, and National Character in Action act as the cornerstone of American intelligence history and are well worth the cost and effort in locating these rare volumes. <br />	2004-12-09

Final Warning: Averting Disaster in the New Age of Terrorism examines the strategic issues-Defense, Deterrence, and Consequence Management-of an antiterrorist program. The issues are as real today as when written, and therefore qualifies it as an immediate classic. Actually, this volume is a harbinger of our post-911 world, and is of greatest value to staff at the strategic level, particularly concerning pre-deployment and training. Much of the material is prophetic, e.g. ... \\"the hijackers of a Kuwait Airlines jumbo jet to Algiers in April 1988 were the most sophisticated. One of the terrorists was actually capable of flying the aircraft.\\" P 37. <br /> <br />This work does not pretend to be exhaustive or definitive, but several general observations emerge from the analysis. First, it highlights the importance of fighting terrorism on a strategic basis, as opposed to playing at tactical security. \\"Consistency of behavior by allied countries is absolutely essential; of similar importance are good intelligence, well-conceived, culturally unbiased analysis (as opposed to the trap of mirror-imaging), and the political will necessary for confronting terrorism. No waffling, no double standard, no surrender. If any of the above are absent, neither the United States nor its allies will be able to cope with terrorism.\\" P 196. \\"After there is an incident or attack...then they give money. But it goes the wrong way. It goes to the wrong place. The money goes to more helicopters and more water cannons, not to more effective training.\\" Pp 70-71. <br /> <br />Second, terrorism is here to stay. \\"In the nether world of low intensity conflict, there is no `light at the end of the tunnel'; the radicals, revolutionaries, and rogue states will keep coming after us. The terrorists and their sponsors are in this game for the long haul. The United States must be prepared to be there too\\" Pp 152-153. <br /> <br />Third, the changing nature of the threat-from large scale open field battles-to urban, low intensity conflict-have opened up the need for a wider range of responses, including some previously considered `off-limits'. \\"The future will also demand a greater willingness of the United States to threaten or actually to use force unilaterally.\\" P 198. <br /> <br />I recommend this volume as the first reading for a graduate level course in strategic intelligence. In addition to interesting vignettes interspersed within the text, there is an example of a simulation or `gaming' exercise in the appendix. <br />	2004-12-09

It makes the critical point that we are facing a very different world today, and proper preparation can avert catastrophe.     With compelling evidence and argument, Peter Savage explains why the businessperson, tourist, and student alike would do well to strongly consider and ingrain a specific personal security discipline. It powerfully demonstrates that security-like any discipline-is not a skill that can be separated from substance and content. Many of the lessons come straight from what professional intelligence officers practice as routine...\\"you should not consider the telephones in your hotel as `secure' for discussions of sensitive business or personal matters.\\" P. 159 ...\\"before walking into the street from your hotel or office, look around at people loitering in the street-both men and women. Observe their facial and clothing details, so you would recognize them if you saw them again later in the day.\\" P. 169...\\"avoid all pattern and routine.\\" P. 179.    The book is also packed with handy checklists, the latest on health and insurance considerations, and referrals. I applaud Mr. Savage and his work; this book was long overdue and should be continually updated. I can think of no other book of recent years more important for the development of a personal security regimen than this one.	2004-11-29

Col. Alexander's Winning the War: Advanced Weapons, Strategies, and Concepts for the Post-911 World is a painful read, but the very pain is testimony to the gravity of the U.S. security/defense situation and his accurate depiction of what needs to be changed. Like any good intelligence officer, he does not alter the facts, but merely illuminates them with enlightened speculation. \\"...weak democracies may actually exacerbate the potential for regional instability. In practice, democracy is very complex and requires experience gained through time and trial. It cannot be bestowed on emerging societies and expected to be successful. We simply must stop anticipating that other countries will act according to the American model. \\" p. 247.  <br /> <br />By admitting that things are not `all right', but that there are only problems waiting for solution, we can move onto what may be reasonable and realistic remedies to the crisis at hand. \\"In the United States we simply do not comprehend the importance of history and consistently focus on near-term solutions based on symptoms. Rarely do we attempt to understand causal relationships. If the problem can't be stated in a twenty-second sound bite, we just forget about it.\\" P 183. <br /> <br />Policy is dependent on intelligence, and the later has been used by the U.S. regularly, though hesitatingly and inconsistently, over the years. For the U.S., a great dilemma arises when the information is gathered and kept subordinate to political correctness and expediency, due to the bureaucratic process' dedication to transparency, impartiality and the rule of law. The tension between `special operations' mentality and openness, between ends and means, makes this study of the problem not only interesting academically, but also potentially useful in practice. \\"The three best methods to determine the likelihood that an active terrorist is attempting to board a flight are profiling, profiling, and profiling.\\" P. 191. \\"Now the War on Terrorhas brought a new focus on assassination as an implement of conflict...there is only one way to deal with terrorists-you kill them.\\" Pp. 198-199. <br /> <br />The solutions depicted throughout various vignettes are sound and practical, one of which pertains to ...\\" revamping the military personnel system. Skilled retirees abounded, most willing to be recalled to fight if an urgent need existed. There was no need to have members of the military serve twenty years consecutively. Over the decades a small number of reservists had proven that intermittent periods on extended active duty could be effective and they could keep up with their counterparts. A strategic response would be to move retirees into homeland security positions and push active-duty personnel into fielded forces abroad.\\" P. 153 \\"...we should develop a unified organization that meets today's requirements. The old system is anachronistic.\\" P. 251. <br /> <br />Excellent...this is the wake-up call. <br />	2004-11-26

Ph.D.s Mueller and Adler have achieved in Outlaws of the Ocean: The Complete Book of Contemporary Crime on the High Seas both an educational and entertaining work on what is probably the most pressing area for current U.S. security. The oceans are today more of an enigma than barriers against foreign aggression. Students of maritime intelligence have to ask why it is that we know so little, and are so unprepared to defend against threats over what covers three quarters of the earth's surface. The authors state \\"For reasons beyond our comprehension... Criminologists have neglected the criminality of that far greater portion of the world called oceans!\\" P. 18. <br /> <br />The need to study the intricacies of the oceanic realm in fighting terrorism, drug trafficking, and illegal immigration amongst other national security threats are addressed in Outlaws of the Ocean. This work, which offers analysis of real life case studies, centers on research based on empirical evidence, and the deep personal maritime experience of the authors. Although published in 1985, it is still worth reading today by those preparing for a career in maritime intelligence. <br /> <br />The authors make a number of cogent and prophetic statements that are relevant to U.S. homeland defense. \\"As a practical matter, most acts of sea borne terrorism are international in nature, not just because of the internationality of the high seas and the commerce they carry, but also because terrorism is, for the most part, an organizational crime, and most of the terrorist organizations are international in character, through membership, financial and other support objectives, or affiliation.\\" Pp. 159-160. <br /> <br />As any good scholar would, the authors provide solutions along with the identified problems. \\"There are two types of solutions: national and international...Students of maritime terrorism tell us that today's maritime terrorism is more likely to strike ships at port...Obviously, vigilance mustbe adjusted to vulnerability, and it is equally obvious that vigilance must be cost-beneficial. If the maritime life of the nation were to be geared wholly toward security, stagnation of commerce would result. One must take calculated risks.\\" P. 176. <br /> <br />The authors also make use of appropiately placed nautical verse and prose making the reading entertaining. <br />	2004-11-09

Police Mission: Challenges and Responses originally aimed at addressing issues surrounding law enforcement management, organizational structure, and police culture. It does a very fine job in this area. However, after reading it again I find it has an equal value to law enforcement's new paradigm as it shifts from the traditionally reactive stance to a proactive approach against the leading threats of today. <br /> <br />By confronting such issues as terrorism, drug trafficking, and illegal immigration, Law Enforcement requires adequate Intelligence support. Concurrent with the development and expansion of intelligence within law enforcement, the wise practitioner, manager and academician alike will give serious thought to the ethical issues of this crucial element. It is here, that Police Mission can be extrapolated to provide the necessary bridge between the role of intelligence within law enforcement and police structure, values, and ethics. <br /> <br />The theory and context of this work is soundly based on the `best management' practices of modern business acumen. I recommend Police Mission as supplemental reading for a Law Enforcement Intelligence course.  <br />	2004-11-02

Dr. Flynn provides meaning to the issues of national security, which is the essence of intelligence. By `adding value' to the sea of raw data, telltale signs, and signals America the Vulnerable becomes the indispensable volume for everyone interested in maritime intelligence matters. <br /> <br />The current series of terrorist atrocities, along with the plague of transnational threats including, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction gives concern for reading information correctly. Beyond that there is a call for action. The oceans are no longer our primary mechanism for defense. These issues and more are brilliantly discussed in America the Vulnerable.  <br /> <br />Because Dr. Flynn possesses that rare combination of experience at sea as a United States Coast Guard Officer and academician there is no better authority on the subject of maritime intelligence, national and homeland security/defense, and the best means for expending precious U.S. resources. Not one to define a problem without a solution, Dr. Flynn provides insight, candor, and imagination to solving U.S. security issues.

However, because there is very little written specifically for maritime intelligence operations, this volume may fill the gap. For those interested in specializing in maritime intelligence operations it would be wise to learn as much as possible about shipboard procedures.    Proper shipboard operations follow a very strict regimen. Therefore, any deviance from what would be seen as normal should send up red flags. Watchstanding Guide for the Merchant Officer is packed full of forms, examples, and procedures that should be a formal part of every ship's operation. During a boarding, or any subsequent investigation, if the investigator doesn't see documentation very similar to that depicted in this work then something is amiss. For those monitoring a ship's movement from an office location, the normal actions for the vessel and crew should be easily visualized after reading this book.    It is a sad state of affairs when there are so many `area experts' that have never set foot within the country of their 'expertise'. The same holds true for the maritime intelligence officer, who has little or no time at sea. There is no substitute for experience, but I do recommend this book as an excellent reader for a maritime intelligence course.	2004-10-31

This is the best work for an account of the role of analysis and its relationship within the intelligence industry. I recommend this book as required reading prior, or in accordance with the first semester of the research methods series of courses at the graduate level.    The material is applicable across various disciplines including law enforcement and military operations, diplomacy, and business. Besides a consistent introduction to tools, arrangements, and concepts, Dr. Clark introduces novel methods such as Delphi; \\"A major advantage of the target-centric approach is that it formalizes the process of obtaining expert opinions. It also lends itself readily to techniques, such as Delphi... One objective of the Delphi method is the encouragement, rather than the suppression, of conflicting or divergent opinions.\\" Pg. 116.    Much of what can be said about the need for new mechanisms to plan and coordinate U.S. national defense missions also applies to homeland security operations. Every significant policy, plan, and operation against terrorists, drug traffickers, and other criminals demands a coordinated response. Therefore, a full understanding and appreciation of intelligence analysis and the analyst's role is rudimentary for consumers of intelligence products.	2004-10-29

Anthony H. Cordesman's Terrorism, Asymmetric Warfare, and Weapons of Mass Destruction: Defending the U.S. Homeland is a text I assign as the centerpiece for a Law Enforcement Intelligence course. This very comprehensive work covers the main elements for an actionable policy against threats both foreign and domestic.    Possibly the most significant aspects of the volume are the merging of the historically polar fields of military and civilian security forces, and erasing the line between national security and foreign defense policy.    Cordesman focuses less on winning the war, and more on sustaining the peace. This is accomplished by first, encouraging a government policy that the military take a lower profile, requiring the police to shoulder a greater portion of the responsibility for peacekeeping.    Second, there is a much greater emphasis on special operations, which focus on the primary objective, i.e., to achieve containment and in particular limiting the appeal of the extremists to their likely sympathizers, even if total elimination may be unachievable.     Additionally, the book identifies consistent, and prescient factors, which strongly influence the likelihood of success in a counterinsurgency campaign. These include, but are not limited to the following:    Geopolitical conditions, such as whether there are bordering states sympathetic to the guerrillas in order to give them a haven and a supply base.   Multiple fronts, which the government must concern itself. The availability of highly trained military and police are necessary to combat small, highly mobile or embedded guerrillas. The more entrenched, and therefore, the more legitimized the insurgency becomes, the more difficult it becomes to undermine their activities, funding, recruitment and support from the population.   Ethnic and religious homogeneity of the indigenous population. The population must be won over to support the government.   The importance of intelligence in a counterinsurgency war cannot be over-emphasized; and this includes a deep understanding and appreciation of the time and effort required to develop and cultivate sources. There is and never will be, a substitute for HUMINT.    Defending the U.S. Homeland depicts a pragmatic policy comprised of a mailed fist, properly coordinated with a velvet glove, heart-and-minds campaign. Undoubtedly, guarding against future transnational crime and terrorist threats, indicate a need for greater communication and flexibility in both U.S. intelligence operations and policy.	2004-10-25

In this `whose to blame' world the paradox portrayed by this work are the responsibilities involved in peacekeeping. The conflict in Northern Ireland has been a huge burden for the British, who have little real sympathy for either side. <br /> <br />However, the main thesis of Martin Dillon's The Dirty War surrounds the notion that covert intelligence procedures and operations, which require a greater intimacy between the hunter and the hunted, are sinister by nature. Somehow, to the uninitiated there seems to be a cleansing process associated by not knowing the enemy.  <br /> <br />The `dirty' part of The Dirty War centers on the concept of assassination. Because, in an unconventional war much of the fighting and dying is done in the shadows, ambushes and small-unit actions dominate the battlefield. The problem then, seems to be that if the attacker did not know the identify of those killed it was war; if they did, it was assassination. The difference is arbitrary, in as much, as every soldier who responds to the will of those who make policy, and war understands the ugliness and reality of combat. <br /> <br />Herein lies the nexus between the historical struggle between the British and Northern Ireland, and the American forces in modern low intensity conflict. Operating in a democracy, controlled by the rule of law, the overriding principal that governs counterinsurgency warfare tactics is that of minimum force. This self-imposed code of ethics often appears to offer the insurgents an unfair advantage. However, as is the case in Northern Ireland so it is in Afghanistan, Iraq, and future conflicts to come...responsibility comes with power, and the United States and Great Britain, if they want to be treated with global respect, must exercise one with the other. <br />	2004-10-25

I assign Sound Doctrine: A Tactical Primer as the workbook for a Law Enforcement Intelligence course. Law enforcement commanders worry about the seeming disunity in strategic and operational policy and its political ramifications. Tactical officers are concerned with handling the more pragmatic issues, such as the insurgencies of drug trafficking, illicit immigration, terrorist activities, and civil disturbances. Reading Sound Doctrine will help.    Charles Heal clearly defines the problems and limitations associated with current policies for the execution of critical incident missions. In fact, the only thing that is known about these new types of operations is that not much is known in advance. Few principals or rules are in place before a crises occurs, so officers and officials who are strangers are forced to cobble together operating procedures in the midst of a crisis. And because each operation tends to be unique in important ways, these same officials are often forced to define a position and response in haste. Those tasked with the responsibility of crisis management and confronting low intensity conflicts, which are the future of state and local law enforcement, have frequently complained about the inadequacy of the machinery of government in these circumstances. Critically examining Sound Doctrine will help.    The traditional departmental division of responsibility for strategic, operational, and tactical missions, while perhaps sufficient for generating policy and building coalitions, is incompatible with and inhibits the development of a department/agency responsible for coordinating, and directing continuous operations. Implementing Sound Doctrine will help.	2004-10-25

White's Defending the Homeland: Domestic Intelligence, Law Enforcement, and Security is the book I assign as the keystone text for a Law Enforcement Intelligence course. It is a `must read' because it correctly portrays intelligence as both art and science, deeply rooted in action-making tangible things happen, getting real things done-by reducing warfare to its simplest level and thereby limiting the negative effects of susceptibilities such as fog, chance, and friction. This volume makes sense of how the traditionally polar fields of law enforcement and intelligence can develop a symbiotic relationship for synergistic effect.     Because it is one of the first sources for this argument, it serves as a measuring stick for both policy and operational analysis. It examines the concepts, uses, and limits of strategic intelligence in contrast to operational imperatives. Very little has been previously offered in law enforcement intelligence beyond rhetoric-which are sound as far as they go-such as, `intelligence is the key to the problem', or `the support of the population must be won'. Students and practitioners tasked with, or having previously experienced the responsibility of actually executing missions will appreciate this book the most.    The essence of the book can clearly be defined as delineating the parameters of low intensity conflict and law enforcement; to deduce from them the principles of asymmetric warfare, and to outline the corresponding strategy and tactics.	2004-10-14

This is an important read for those interested in understanding current world disorder, and the future of Low Intensity Conflict. An examination of the American experience in the Vietnam War, probably provides some of the best examples of the criteria necessary for success in Low Intensity Conflict, including but not limited to guerilla war and insurgency. Andrad&eacute; identifies in Ashes to Ashes the criteria as articulation, accessibility, and accountability.<br /><br />Articulation of specific goals and objectives must be clear and reasonable. Accessibility of the officials to the general populace must be systematic. The accountability of every member in an operation must be held to the highest standards. Finally, the combination of the above must achieve a synergistic effect; whereby, the ability to accomplish the mission is accompanied with the will and desire to sustain the effort for whatever duration it takes!<br /><br />The Phoenix program was a response to a war whose objectives were never clearly stated, but were implemented incrementally, and largely ignored such basic elements as public support, a willing and competent host, and consideration of past experiences evaluated and analyzed by its intelligence community. The Vietnam syndrome is not dissimilar from either the Israeli/Palestine conflict, or current US/Iraqi war. The ultimate question is whether a democratic society burdened with occupation of another unwilling people can, despite its best intentions, sustain the rule of law long enough to achieve the peace.	2004-10-09
