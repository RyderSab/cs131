Storms!<br />I laughed.  I cried.  I got anxious and hysterical ... but then I've been on an emotional roller coaster since age 11.... I get like that sometimes.  <br />\\"Triggerfish Twist\\" is the best Tim Dorsey novel so far!<br />SUPREMELY RECOMMENDED!  Read this one!  Pretty please!  With sugar on top!	2002-06-05

I purchased Douglas Adams' posthumous book exactly one year and one day after his extremely untimely passing.  I have always thought that there is something inherently wrong about losing one's idols.  &quot;Salmon of Doubt&quot; is a prime example of how wrong it truly is.  <br />&quot;Salmon of Doubt&quot; is so absolutely and quite wonderfully Douglas.<br />This collection of articles, interviews, random thoughts and unfinished novel is an genuine treat to read.  His unmistakable voice shines through on each and every page.  For someone who professed to agonize over the whole &quot;writing thing&quot;, Douglas did it with a style that is often imitated, yet never will be duplicated.<br />I was delighted to see &quot;Cookies&quot; make its way into this collection.  I laughed when he included in the 4th Hitchhiker's novel, and was fortunate enough to hear him retelling this true story.  He had everyone at this Chicago hotel bar in absolute hysterics some years ago, reliving the moment.  I have never forgotten it.<br />&quot;Maggie and Trudie&quot; also stands out as one of my other favorite entries here.  As does &quot;The Private Life of Genghis Khan&quot;.  The interviews included also give a further glimpse into this marvelously gifted man.<br />There is no doubt in my mind that the ever-so brief &quot;Salmon of Doubt&quot; story/novel itself would have been a joy to read had he been around to finish it.  It would have worked perfectly well as the next Dirk Gently (or possible 6th HH) novel.  I found myself reading this portion quickly, watching the pages dwindle and knowing it was going to abruptly end.  It did.  Now I'm left wondering what happened to Dirk and Desmond the rhinoceros.  It's going to bug me till the end of time.  Which I am sure would thrill Douglas to no end.  <br />I'll have to ask Douglas when I see him at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe how it all ends.	2002-05-24

Nothing could be further from the truth where this one is concerned.<br />There is absolutely no sympathy to be had for the main character of Kate McDolan. She's an unhappy, spoiled upper-class little brat.  She is trapped in a loveless marriage of her own creation. She is despondent over her inability to relate with her own son and resented as a teacher by the small town yokels. <br />She opts to one day \\"conveniently kidnap\\" the nightgown-wearing, one-dimensional-stereotypical-loner/weirdo, Mistie Henderson.<br />Kate's preposterous intent is to steal herself and Mistie, relocate to Canada and live happily ever after with her hippie friends from college. A better life for both of them is her ultimate vision. The preposterous turns to the ludicrous when their departure is ruined before it even begins. Kate is carjacked by a 15 year old small town-Cops reject-gangsta-wanna-be named Tony (a.k.a. Angela.)<br />I found it incredibly difficult to fathom that a fit, 38 year old teacher could not have overpowered a scrawny 15 year old kid ONCE throughout this entire story. Kate comes out of this ordeal with more damage to herself that is reasonably possible.<br />Tony (Angela) herself annoyingly shifts personas throughout the novel.  She's a grade school drop-out amazed at the interior of a no-tell motel one moment... a first rate actress finagling a ride out of ridiculously cardboard-cutout (read: doofus) secondary characters the next...all generously combined with a cold, methodical foul-mouthed murderess every other moment of the story.<br />The story stops dead in the final pages, without any sort of concrete resolution.  A world of entertaining novels awaits you out there... regrettably \\"Wire Mesh Mothers\\" is not one of them.	2002-05-22

It conveys the chill and solitary feeling one would experience in a blizzard.  I adored the novel for its cover more so than the story within.<br />About a quarter of the way into it I found myself doing the book equivalent of channel surfing... that is... skimming pages until I got to passages that mentioned either the Doctor or Leela.  I would start reading at that point, as I really didn't care for a majority of the characters in this particular installment.  But that's just me.<br />It's been interesting in recent adventures to see past incarnations out of the United Kingdom and in what is ostensibly foreign lands to fans of the series.  This one was just a little below par story-wise.  If this were an episode of the series... it would have been similar to &quot;Image of the Fendahl&quot; or &quot;Underworld.&quot;  I didn't care for those particular episodes, but I watched them just the same.<br />Two stars for the brilliant artwork and the fourth Doctor's ever-so brief appearances in the story.	2002-05-09

'Let's see.  We've got the disappearance of all UNIT personnel, excluding the Brigadier, and Mike Yates, who has turned into a cardboard shadow of his former self, we've got a spacecraft full of very irate, hand-bag worshiping aliens hovering above the planet, we've got a forest of deadly trees on fire, a mysterious green man who seems to be our sworn enemy, and, on the other hand, we've got killer robot sheep and the safety of Jo and Tom to account for.  Is that a fair summary?\\"<br />That's exactly what you get when you read Paul Magrs \\"Verdigris'.  A classic romp back into that magical time of Dr. Who known as the early half of the 1970's!  <br />1973 finds our exiled Timelord and his assistant Jo Grant, relaxing in his home in the English country.  He is visited by his self-proclaimed paramour, Iris Wildthyme and her assistant Tom.  Her arrival is, shall we say, less than welcome.  She has a working Tardis and the Doctor is still in exile on Earth.  To make matters worse, Iris is constantly telling him things that have yet to happen to him.  <br />I have quite enjoyed the references to the Doctor's residence made in this and several of the other novels.  The concept round out the character and adds a lovely dimension (pardon the pun) to the man.<br />Magrs does a grand job of capturing the heart(s) of the Pertwee era.  This could easily have been shot for the series and it would have fit comfortably well.<br />This has something for everyone.  The third incarnation at his suave best, Jo Grant at her inquisitive best, the hamlet that the Doctor calls home away from his lab, an appearance by the Master and the entire staff of UNIT working in a grocery store.<br />Verdigris is a fun read.  This scores a high 3-1/2 stars with me.	2002-03-22

This novel is made completely out of cheese.\\"<br />It's easy to see how the novel \\"Fatalis\\" may have been optioned for a film.  <br />Certainly all the ingredients are in place:  The rugged and handsome widower Professor.  The plucky, attractive and independently wealthy newspaper reporter.  The Napoleon-esque, Viet Nam veteran sheriff.  The noble and introspective Native American mentor.  And let's not forget the stars themselves, the thawed out, toothy, super-intelligent pussy cats.<br />\\"Fatalis\\" is a novel that is written for a long wait in an airport terminal and/or a flight stuck out on the tarmac.  The chapters are extremely short.  Some less than two and a half pages.  The characters are two dimensional, and the dialogue is at times preachy.  The sabertooths  (or is that saberteeth?) come and go as they please; both on land and at sea.  People get gobbled up without so much as a fight.<br />Another reviewer made a very astute comment.  It's absolutely amazing how fully armed police-officers and national guardsmen are taken down in a matter of nano-seconds.  Meanwhile, in various points throughout the story, our hero Prof. Grand, manages to elude becoming Meow Mix by using a stick, a stone and handmade prehistoric noisemaker.  <br />Fans of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 will no doubt throw out one-liners as they read this novel.  I know I did.  It's cheese from beginning to end.  And it's not even Wensleydale!  All that was missing from the novel's climax was the obligatory . . . .  THE END ???  to complete the cheesy monster movie feel.<br />2-1/2 stars for the Sabertooth Cats.  I was rooting for them throughout the novel.	2002-03-21

I only just recently finished &quot;Fender Benders&quot; also by Bill Fitzhugh (see separate review) and enjoyed &quot;Cross Dressing&quot; so much more!<br />This novel has the laugh-out-loud situations and interwoven storylines that made &quot;Pest Control&quot; such a funny and utterly delightful read.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.<br />Dan Steele and his twin brother Michael grew up poor.  Dan vowed long ago never to go back to this lifestyle, so he dives head first into the world of advertising and print/television commercials.  Michael is a Catholic priest, who lives his life in service of the church, mostly helping starving tribes in Africa.<br />An ailing Michael returns home to &quot;visit&quot; his brother and their whack-a-loon mother.  Lacking insurance coverage, Dan sends Michael into the hospital posing as him.  Michael dies.  Dan becomes Michael in an attempt to escape the snowballing events surrounding his own life.  (Read the book, no spoilers here!)<br />The sequence of Dan first masquerading as a priest in the hospital as he receives the bill for services rendered is funny enough to warrant buying this novel.  The litany of tests, surgeries, probing and prodding that the poor priest went through is absolutely hilarious.<br />Can a 30-something, money-grubbing, Glenlivet drinking, conniving ad-man on the run pull off the ultimate performance?!  And what's Dan going to do about celibacy around the knock-out nun, Sister Peg?!  (Read the book and find out.)<br />&quot;Cross Dressing&quot; ranks second for me of the Bill Fitzhugh books.  Just behind &quot;Pest Control&quot; and one place above &quot;Organ Grinders&quot; and &quot;Fender Benders&quot;.<br />Without giving too much of the wonderful story away... know this much...There's a lot of fun to be had!  Give this novel a try.	2002-03-14

The character became more of a puppet-master.  Someone who manipulated events behind the scenes, knowing well in advance the outcome of his actions. This stole a lot of the charm away from the character and the series for me. So, author David A. McIntee was fighting an uphill battle to keep my interest as a reader from the get go.<br />I picked up this novel as it was a pairing of my favorite companion from the series with an incarnation she'd never encountered. The three star rating (2-1/2 really) is basically for the truly impressive handling of the character of Sarah-Jane Smith.<br />She's aged well and still as tenacious as ever. There are no lengths she would not go to in order to get a story and the novel \\"Bullet Time\\" is no exception. I found her portions of the tale most entertaining. I also quite enjoyed the sequences with the Eastern Branch of UNIT.<br />I didn't hate it, nor did I fall madly in love with it. The character of Sarah-Jane has traveled with the Doctor far longer and experienced many more adventures than any of the other companions. I was just hoping for some of that old magic and chemistry between them to pop up somewhere during \\"Bullet Time.\\" It never did. <br />Another line of the 7th incarnation's that bothered me is paraphrased as follows:<br />\\"The Doctor you knew is long dead.\\" That line sort of soured the novel as a whole for me.<br />\\"Bullet Time\\" will no doubt enterain fans of Sylvester's character. He is represented well in this story. It just didn't thrill me as other novels in this series. A fair review for a fair installment.	2002-03-14

(Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you!)  It is a delightful read with some great characters and criss-crossing storylines.  It's just a little dry in areas, whereas I was expecting something more along the lines of his earlier works.  &quot;Fender Benders&quot; is missing a lot of the 'ha-ha' factor.  But that's a minor nitpick.<br />While this novel is clearly the tale of new country music sensation Eddie Long's rise to glory... it's also a novel packed with a fantastic supporting cast and several interesting sub-stories.  I personally liked the character of Jimmy, who is Eddie's friend at the beginning and volunteers to write his biography.  If there are decent lines to be had in this novel... Jimmy gets most of them.<br />The character of Meagan (Jimmy's ex girlfriend, gasp!!) becomes Eddie's  &quot;Yoko Ono&quot; or &quot;Courtney Love&quot; and is continually giving Eddie's management team conniption fits.  Her vision is to insert herself as far into Eddie's life/career as possible and get all that she can.  It makes for some interesting tension.<br />Bill Fitzhugh certainly did a great job researching this novel.  There is a distinct &quot;feel&quot; to the novel when all the characters are in the studio trying to bring together all the elements for Eddie's first record.  It just works.<br />Music, murder, money, cover-ups, backhanded dealings, investigations, sex and some of the best fried shrimp in Nashville.  All these things await you as you read &quot;Fender Benders.&quot;<br />I liked it a lot, but not as much as his other novels.  That having been said, it certainly won't stop me from picking up Bill Fitzhugh's next novel.  I recommend this one with no reservations.  A good read all in all.	2002-01-10

Gene's autobiography will no doubt delight the true Kiss fan, as it is an unashamed, behind-the-scenes look back on the wild ride that is Kiss.   <br />It will also enrage a lot of the fair weather fans.  Namely those who were:  a) not around when the band was in its hey-day... or... b) Those that believe Kiss can only ever be the four original members. <br />I found the chapters of a young Gene living in Israel and moving to America to be very interesting.  I also enjoyed reading of Gene's obsession with television, monster movies and comic books.  When I got to the formation of the hottest band in the world... I was only SLIGHTLY disappointed that there weren't any more road stories, or more on his growing partnership with co-founder Paul Stanley.  Oh, there are plenty of small stories, mind you, but Gene could have sprinkled in a few more juicy tales from past tours and records.<br />But that's a MINOR nitpick in what is an overall good read.  Gene has obviously worked hard to get to where he is today and deserves the rewards of that hard work.  He comes off in his writing style as a man who knows precisely what he wants in his life.  There's nothing wrong with that.  He is a dedicated father and clearly adores his children and their mother.  There's nothing wrong with that either!  More power to you, Gene!  It's America and if you work hard enough, you should be able to enjoy what you have without a care for what other people think.<br />As for the treatment Ace, Peter and Vinnie receive in this book... well... let's just say that it wasn't anything I didn't already figure out in the band's 30 year history.  The in-fighting, substance abuse, ego trips, etc. is obvious if you really take a good, hard, long look at the band throughout the years.  And all of that's fine.  I have no problem with any of it.  I got nearly 30 years of entertainment from a band I adore.  From each and every member along the way.  No one can take that away.<br />Reading Gene's autobiography brought back a lot of memories from what was (and continues to be) a great life.  Every record.  Every tour.  It reminded my of how fun it is to be a Kiss fan .  I'm glad I read it.<br />There are fifteen words that will stay with me for as long as I live.  The sheer delight and excitement of being in an arena or stadium when it goes pitch black and I hear, &quot;You wanted the best.  You got the best.  The hottest band in the world.... KISS!!&quot;<br />Some of you know what happens after that.	2001-12-28

Our main character, a disheveled Hank Thorwald, is caught wearing only one shoe, holding a chicken and a revolver with only four bullets left.  He is being held at gun-point by the chicken's owner who recognizes Hank from recent television reports.  The sound of approaching police sirens can be heard in the background.  What a great way to start off this story!<br />&quot;Katastrophe&quot; is a very good and swift read.  Without repeating past reviews, the Thorwald family fall prey to an easily excited and relentless media, and the Grade-A whack-a-loons that come out of the woodwork when a particular story is overhyped.  <br />There are plenty of twists and turns in this story that will surely entertain.  The pacing for most of the novel is first rate.  There are plenty of people who would like to get their hands on Hank.  Some of those people have come from as far away as Berlin.  But that's a story within the story that needs to be read to be believed!<br />My only nitpick comes in the form of the character Detective Gleeworth.  I wasn't overly impressed by his procedural tactics and his automatic assumption of guilt towards Hank Thorwald.  I was also disturbed by the glibness and utter lack of concern from the entire Terre Haute police department following a shocking incident involving the Thorwald's daughter.   (I don't want to spoil anything... read the novel and find out!)<br />That and the novel's rather quick wrap-up are my only TEENY TINY faults with what is otherwise a great read.  I would not hesitate to pick up another novel by Mr. Boyll.  I'm a tough grader and this novel was a lot of fun.  This one gets 3 and 3/4 stars... so very close to 4 stars.<br />This novel will certainly entertain!  Give it a read.	2001-12-28

I've noticed that his stories start off at first with a unique premise, yet sadly, never come to fruition.  Of the three of his books that I have read, I found this to be the only one I didn't actually skim through.  But I was still disappointed when it was all said and done.<br />How shallow, greedy and bored the main character Jane that she'd willingly continue, nightly, to risk life and limb for cash?!  Take the 50 bucks and go have a nice dinner, Jane!  Sheesh!<br />The characters, what few there are, are really laughable.  The character of Brace is thrown in as a red herring.  Is he or isn't he the Master of Games?  Is he or isn't he?  Hmmmm.<br />There are two common themes I have found in Laymon's books:  <br />The first being bizarre S&amp;M scenes that are thrown in more to &quot;shock&quot; than to advance the narrative.  One of Jane's midnight excursions to a supposedly abandoned house is oddly familiar to the basement sequence in the film &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;  It served no purpose in this story whatsoever, other than to gross out, and also to propel the character of Jane to do something utterly unredeemable.  Life's that cheap, eh Jane? <br />The second is his use of rape against the lead female character.  In this novel (and one other by Laymon that I can name) there is a rape scene that is supposed to shock the reader.  His flippant treatment of the act and Jane's incomprehensible attitude over the ordeal I found to be highly insulting.  <br />One question readers will come away with is:  &quot;Why was Jane picked by MOG in the first place?&quot;<br />Juvenile writing, pretty much.  Ridiculous plot-line and character actions, oh yes.  The smug and gratuitous introduction from Mr. Koontz aside... if you're seeking a gripping horror read... keep looking.    <br />The three star rating is for its quick read and nub of a story line.  It will thrill some and marginally entertain others.	2001-12-12

This novel is without a doubt in my Top Three Novels of 2001!<br />This is an IMPRESSIVE novel that is SCREAMING to be optioned by Hollywood and made into the next spooky/macabre classic.  But if they do, Neil has to do the screenplay!!<br />Without repeating too much of what has already been said... the character of Shadow is instantly likeable.  He is the novel's focal point.  His journey and adventure through the real world and that of the Gods is highly entertaining.<br />This novel is like a tapestry with many, many, many interwoven pieces.  It is a sheer delight to read.  There is something for the life-long Gaiman fan...(namely some uncredited cameos by the Endless)... and there is quite a lot for the first time reader... namely a well crafted novel.<br />There are tales and origins of Gods of the old/ancient world, as well as appearances by America's new Gods.  TV, technology, etc.<br />Neil even crafts a story within a story for Shadow when he is hiding out in a small Wisconsin town.  For television buffs, a sort of &quot;Picket Fences&quot;/&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; murder mystery.  (I called it right away, fyi.)<br />I simply cannot say enough nice things about this absolute gem from Mr. Gaiman.  His depiction of the midwestern states is dead on.  ALL of the characters are thought out and vividly represented.<br />Read this one if you get the chance.  You will not be disappointed.	2001-12-12

There really was no actual need for the aliens involved in this tale.  It would have sailed along on its own merits with just the Fourth Reich group, a resurrected Adolph Hitler!?!(I won't spoil anything) and the time travel to WWII.<br />Both the Brigadier and Doctor are brought to life in this story.  Although, neither this incarnation nor the Brig met in the original series, the conversations between them are just right.  You can easily picture/hear Colin Baker and Nicholas Courtney saying these lines.<br />The solo trip back to WWII by the Doctor and the subsequent trip with the Brigadier were pure Doctor Who fun.<br />And I myself was not surprised by the ending.  In traditional Doctor Who fashion... all the clues of what was going to transpire was there in the text.<br />A fun Doctor Who adventure!  I can't say that for a lot of the novels I've read in this series.  But I can on this one.  Give 'The Shadow in the Glass' a try!	2001-12-12

My many thanks to Bentley Little for finally bringing to light the true evil that lurks in our world: The homeowner's association! <br />Anyone who has dealt with one will get the fiendishly tongue-in-cheek satire of the rules and regulations set by the Bonita Vista Home Association. Their audacity and absurdity are brilliant. That's where Bentley Little's newest story works best.<br />You can tell Bentley has an enormous amount of fun populating his novels. The characters are at once instantly recognizable, yet all have their own distinct underlying personalities. <br />Ray and Liz are the older neighbors who secretly defy the association and welcome in Barry and Maureen. Neil Campbell is the clipboard- toting neighborhood snitch. Jasper Calhoun is the mysterious Association president. And then there's Stumpy, the armless-legless-toothless-tongueless resident slinking around in the surrounding woodlands. (What? Doesn't your neighborhood have a Stumpy?!)<br />Bentley has obviously cast himself as the lead character of Barry Welch. Like Bentley, Barry's also a horror writer and there's nothing wrong with that. My only SLIGHT issue with &quot;The Association&quot; is a recurring theme that seemed to plague his last outing &quot;The Town&quot;. <br />Several characters in his last novel were constantly saying things to the effect of: &quot;It's just like a horror movie.&quot; In &quot;The Association&quot; Barry Welch has this annoying habit of referring to an event as something out of his own horror novels. <br />There are over a dozen such references of a situation being &quot;something out of one of his horror novels&quot;. On Page 249 it happens twice in as many pages. It happens again (twice in as many pages) during the story's finale. That sort of took a bit away from an otherwise interesting read. It's my only small nit-pick with the story.<br />It's not a bad novel by any stretch. It was better than his last novel &quot;The Town&quot;. Oddly enough, I think there may have even been a paragraph on page six that I swear was used verbatim in that last novel.<br />I'd put it in the bronze medal position behind &quot;The Store&quot; and &quot;The Ignored&quot;. Two other Bentley Little novels that shouldn't be missed.	2001-09-20

To it's credit, &quot;Bump &amp; Run&quot; is a light novel that readers will finish very quickly, if at all. There are a handful of descriptive gags that may/may not get a chuckle, but I found nothing that was laugh out loud hilarious.<br />The main problem with &quot;Bump &amp; Run&quot; is that there really isn't much of a story to be had. Jack Molloy inherits the New York Hawks; much to the chagrin of his stepmother, his two younger siblings, the Hawks management staff, the team, the coaches and the rest of the NFL.<br />What follows is a thin story about whether or not Jack actually wants the team, and whether or not he can convince the other league owner's to vote for his ownership approval.<br />The Hawk players are intended to be reflections of the &quot;superstar jocks&quot; of today's NFL. They really come off as poorly developed louts. The team would have done well without any of them on the active roster. There's a very shallow relationship between Jack and a waitress from the club the players hang out at, but very little effort was put into that portion of the story as well.<br />&quot;Bump &amp; Run&quot; has a television pilot quality to it and will be a hit or miss book with readers. You'll either love it or hate it. All of the characters: be they team members, girlfriends, sportscasters, owners, etc. are all painted with the biggest stereotypical brush in the box.<br />You might want to let this one stay on the shelf and tune in to the real NFL for the true characters in the sport.	2001-09-06

Jack is relatable.  He's not the perfect super-spy and not everything he does goes off without a hitch.  This is very refreshing in this sort of novel.<br />Secret organizations within secret organizations.  CIA cover-ups.  Black helicopters.  Cattle mutilations.  Men in black.  Border hopping in the modern age.  Nail-gun torture.  This novel has everything but the kitchen sink thrown into it.  The interesting thing to observe is that somehow it all works.  In the hands of another writer this wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining.<br />My only regret is that the character of Clementine was so one dimensional.  She is never totally developed and used to her fullest potential.  She's along for the ride with Jack and that's about it.  More thought was given to the secondary and tertiary characters than our hero's love interest and that's a shame.  <br />I'll admit that &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; does end somewhat abruptly and cryptically.  But that's a minor issue.  Overall this was a great read.<br />As the cover states:Admit nothing.  Deny everything.  Spare no one....  <br />Add to that.... Read this novel.  It's a lot of fun.	2001-09-04

What can I say about &quot;Orange Crush&quot;, Tim Dorsey's third novel?<br />I know!  How about... I absolutely loved this book.  I laughed.  I giggled.  I chortled.  I laughed some more.  At one point I laughed so hard milk came out of my nose.  This frightened me to no end, as I'm lactose intolerant and haven't had milk in about 15 years.  (I will be seeking medical help for this condition as soon as I am done writing this review.)<br />&quot;Orange Crush&quot; was a sheer delight to read!  Like several other reviewers, I couldn't put it down, finished it one day and found myself severely disappointed when it came to an end.  Once again Tim populates his world with an eccentric bunch of loonies that do not disappoint!<br />I don't want to ruin anything for someone who hasn't read this novel, so without giving away too many spoilers . . . I found the scenes inside Helmut von Zeppelin's private skybox hilarious!  I also particularly enjoyed Gomer Tatum's penchant for finger foods...DURING gubernatorial debates!<br />&quot;Orange Crush&quot; is pretty much a stand alone novel.  You don't have to have read the other two by Tim Dorsey to get the jokes.  But if you haven't, pick up his other two novels immediately!  Together these three novels paint a devilishly twisted world that really should be put upon the silver screen!<br />Welcome back, Serge!!  Nice to see you again!<br />What else can I say?!  It's got a front cover, a back cover and a bunch o' pages stuffed with lunacy and brilliant characters in-between.  I loved this one!  You made my summer Tim!	2001-08-23

It's being pulled in two completely different directions, but neither team is gaining any ground.  <br />The story starts off somewhat promisingly with the classic tale of teenage love.  Main character Kevin Murphy is turning fourteen and he's in love with his best female friend, Nikki.  But would he ever tell her?  No way!  When Nikki starts going out with someone that Kevin knows is no good for her, Kevin laments not telling her his true feelings and is forced to stand on the sidelines while she and Pete go out.  (And who hasn't that ever happened to?!)<br />The story completely falls apart when it turns into an extremely bad Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure.  Kevin and his crew must do battle with goblins, shadow creatures and even thinly disguised Orcs (called Trows in this book), in order to save Nikki from the &quot;not-so-evil-after-all&quot; clutches of Pete and his entourage.<br />The final battle sequences are just silly.  Lots of axe wielding, arrow shooting and bell ringing.  D&amp;D fans will no doubt find this portion entertaining.  I did not.  <br />My one other major problem in this story involves Kevin and the gang's access to alcohol and other controlled substances.  These kids drank more beer at 13 and 14 than I did in my entire senior year in high school!  I sincerely doubt that liquor laws were that easily manipulated in Massachusetts during the early 1980's.  <br />You'll get two stories for the price of one with this particular novel.  Unfortunately neither of those two stories is written to any sort of conclusion.  I gave it two stars for the character development, but that's about it.  I really wanted to care for Kevin and the gang, but the journey to Neverland dashed any of those hopes.	2001-08-14

The front cover states that it's \\"a dark caper in the tradition of Hiassen.\\"  This is somewhat true.<br />The main character/rogue, Warren (a.k.a. Tom), is likeable enough.  He works a graveyard shift gig but wants to return to college.  An old flame (read: ex-partner in small time crime) re-enters his life with a chance-of-a-lifetime scam that will get him the money he needs to further his education.<br />The two travel to New Zealand (!) to commit their crime.  Their objective?  A set of coins worth a tidy sum!  <br />I personally think that this is where a truly funny storyline was passed up.  Warren and Maggie set their sites on the son of New Zealand's Prime Minister.  Warren, now posing as Tom, gets a job as a dishwasher at the cricket club in an attempt to befriend the young man and get Maggie involved with him.  However, women aren't exactly this guy's cup o' tea.  <br />Rather than pursue this as a potential storyline, Gil Roscoe settles for going after the younger sister.  I think some laughs could have been had in the other realm.  Warren would have truly been a fish out of water had the author gone that route.  Or possibly, maybe the world's greatest con man!  Who can say?<br />That very tiny nitpick having been said, \\"Company of Thieves\\" is a fine novel.  It's a quick and entertaining story.  I will certainly pick up Gil Roscoe's next novel.<br />I give it a solid three and a half stars.	2001-08-10
US	50674172	R2CZT0297Z1M9I	0563555963	796953142	Heart of TARDIS (Doctor Who Series)	Books	1	6	7	N	N	Ouch!  This one hurt!	&quot;Heart of Tardis&quot; tries so very hard to be many different things all at the same time.  It's a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 episode.  It's a Simpson's episode.  It's a Cheers episode.  Why, it's even a Professionals episode.  How regrettable is the fact that the one thing it isn't, is a Doctor Who episode!<br />Like all the other reviewers, I agree that Dave Stone slaps two incarnations of the Doctor in a story that does not match up with the back-cover timeline suggested.  <br />The story picks up with the 4th Doctor and Romana clearly off the search for the Key to Time.  It serves no real purpose other than to get the Doctor and Romana I involved in this novel.  The pacing of the novel never quite seems to fit the action going on.<br />Mr. Stone thanks some friends who helped him in fleshing out Patrick Troughton's character.  There's our first problem.  If Mr. Stone wasn't sure how the character was supposed to act, why choose him?  The characterization suffers greatly throughout this novel.  Even the 4th incarnation of the Doctor isn't quite right.  <br />A vast majority of the novels in this series manage to at least capture some essence of the Doctor.  &quot;Heart of Tardis&quot; does not.  It's a very long journey with no real pay-off.<br />The writing style leaves a lot to be desired as well.  I found &quot;Rabid old trout&quot; to be an odd description for the Prime Minister.  It just didn't fit the novel.  <br />Even the homage to my second favorite British TV show, &quot;The Professionals&quot;, could not save this novel.  The possibilities of these two particular incarnations meeting was absolutely squandered.  Maybe at the hands of another author within this series, the two can truly meet up again for an adventure of substance.<br />To quote Crow T. Robot from the aforementioned MST3K:  &quot;This is bad.  Bad, bad, bad.  Bad to the bone, bad.  Born under a bad sign bad.&quot;<br />When I say, run.... RUN AWAY from this installment.	2001-07-25

I initially bought &quot;Tokyo Suckerpunch&quot; based on the back cover recommendation by Bill Fitzhugh.  I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Fitzhugh's novels and was interested in reading something in a similar style.<br />To it's credit, &quot;Tokyo Suckerpunch&quot; isn't a bad story at all.  But to be honest, I wasn't very impressed at the beginning.  My opinion changed around page 153.  One line really made me laugh, and the book really started to come together for me from that point on.  <br />The line reads something like:  &quot; Your ego thinks of people as dead rather than accept the fact that they're leading a life without you.&quot;  Whose ego DOESN'T think that way?  I liked that line a lot.<br />At this point, I really connected with the main character of Billy Chaka.  One of my favorite scenes involves Billy walking over to the hotel mini-fridge for a drink, only to find that there wasn't a beer to be had.  Only a single kiwi-lime-strawberry-flavored wine cooler.  Billy's comment?  &quot;I needed a drink, but not that bad.  I hoped I never needed a drink that bad and closed the fridge.&quot;<br />Again, who hasn't THAT happened to?<br />First time author Isaac Adamson hints of prior adventures of Billy Chaka.  It would be fun to read those other adventures.  One hopes that this isn't the only time we'll get to see Billy.<br />There's a great collection of goof-ball characters in &quot;Tokyo Suckerpunch&quot; that will entertain readers.  It might have taken a while to get moving, but it really is a fun novel.	2001-07-17

Classic!<br />There are two distinct similarities between Dee Dee's debut novel &quot;Chelsea Horror Hotel&quot; and the music he and the Ramones have given us...both are defiant and timeless.<br />Dee Dee's stream of consciousness writing will catch you from the very beginning and never let go.  There's a wonderful gritty quality to his long form writing style.  The individual who penned so many great songs is clearly present within the covers of this novel.  <br />It's surprising how many of Dee Dee's songs could act as the soundtrack to &quot;Chelsea Horror Hotel&quot;.  If you've ever wondered why the Ramones sang, &quot;I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement&quot;...you need only read this novel to find out!    At times, some of the scenes that Dee Dee describes have a sort of &quot;comic-book&quot; feel to them.  The insertion of some of his original artwork lends itself nicely and compliments these passages.<br />His biographical stuff was a lot of fun to read, but &quot;Chelsea Horror Hotel&quot; surpasses his earlier work.  This is a FANTASTIC debut novel.  Keep it up, Dee Dee!  I look forward to your next one!<br />Gabba Gabba Hey!	2001-07-17

The fifth incarnation and Peri didn't have much time together in the tv series and I'm glad Nick Walters chose this pairing for his adventure.  It reads very easily and I thought it was a lot of fun!<br />The baddies:  The Valethske would have been a worthy addition to the television series.  Imagine them attaining recurrent villain status in the show!  Ruthless, without conscience, and not to mention constantly hungry!  They're right up there with some of the classic Who villains.<br />I admit I got a little tired of them referring to humans as &quot;prey&quot; throughout the novel.  But to be fair, is this any different than a Dalek screaming, &quot;You will be ex-ter-mi-nated!&quot;  every five seconds?  I don't think so.  It's part of their character.  It works.<br />The supporting cast:  The treatment of the Eknuri, as characters, seemed a bit muddy.  But then again, the story really wasn't about them, was it?  We're also told of an &quot;Encounter&quot; Dr. Aline Vehlmann went through in her past, but that isn't really delved into with a lot of detail.  Suffice it to say, she's now a xenophobe and feels that her destiny is elsewhere in the cosmos.  Thawed out soldiers Capt. Melrose and Lt. Meharg are there to provide the bang-bang element needed to counteract the savagry of the Valethske.<br />I found this to be a fun outing for the Doctor and company.  Fans of Peter Davison will enjoy this novel.	2001-07-13

I found it interesting someone would feel &quot;The Time Monster&quot; needed a sequel.  This novel had the same feeling as the other Doctor Who novel &quot;Divided Loyalties&quot;.  A supposed sequel to the Celestial Toymaker.  Was it really necessary?<br />&quot;The Quantum Archangel&quot; is probably not a book for the casual reader/fan of the Doctor Who line.  This one is for true loyalists of the series.  There are references that will go over the casual fan's head.  <br />On the plus side, The Master is used quite well throughout most of the novel.  I was always partial to Anthony Ainley's portrayal in the series and found that his character comes across smoothly in many of his scenes.  One can just hear that sonorous laugh of his.<br />I very much enjoyed the parallel universes the Quantum Archangel created for the novel's characters.  Imagine getting your own personal universe where everything you ever wanted had come true!  And then, along come the Chronovores to eat away at it!  The end result being your dreams crashing in around you in the most horrific way possible.<br />I probably would have liked this one a whole lot more had Craig Hinton kept up the parallel time-line aspect of the story.  I wasn't disappointed in the novel, but neither was I totally satisfied.<br />Again, casual readers may wish to pass.  Come back to this one once you're more comfortable with the Whoniverse.  Fans of the Sixth incarnation . . . well . . . you read it and see what you think.<br />More Master, less Kronos.  That was my take on it.	2001-06-20

Sophie Kinsella's &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; was a funny and charming novel.  Becky Bloomwood is perhaps more common than most people will want to admit.  She knows she ought to stop spending money on &quot;things&quot;, but just can't find the solution to her problem.<br />One of the most delightful sequences has got to be when Becky purchases a copy of &quot;Controlling Your Cash&quot;.  Her intent is to use it as a guide to saving money.  If only that were the case!  Her rationale for all the purchases that follow are hilarious.<br />My favorite part of the novel is when she reads that she can make a homemade curry, rather than go out for one, for under 2.50 pounds.  By the time Becky purchases a brand new pan and all the ingredients for her curry it comes to something like 72.28 pounds!  (I'm familiar with that!  Isn't that always the way?)  The tragically hot results of her curry make for fun reading as well.<br />The surrounding cast are fleshed out beautifully and have their own unique personalities.  There are a few segments where the narrative slows down a bit, however, it does not take away from the delight of this story.<br />We can only speculate what some of Becky's replies to her bill collector's were in this novel, as we only get to see their letters to her.  The letters from the bank and creditors are quite funny.<br />This is a great summertime novel.	2001-06-15

While Brian Lumley's final installment to the Necroscope saga wasn't exactly all I had personally hoped it would be, it was still an incredibly fantastic read!  Truly worthy Necroscope fans worldwide!<br />Taken as the final series installment it certainly brings closure to all the various loose-ends that have been dangling out there.  <br />Taken as a whole in all of the thirteen novels . . . it fits beautifully in the Necroscope time line.  To call this novel a &quot;stale&quot; bottle of wine is vastly incorrect.  &quot;Necroscope: Avengers&quot; is an integral component to a brilliant and impressive tapestry.    My only regret is that the ride had to end.  It's been a lot of fun over the years.  The entire Necroscope saga has been thoroughly well-crafted and entertaining!  Jake Cutter may have been a reluctant Necroscope, but he did an admirable job regardless.<br />After three novels, some of the arguments between Jake and Ben Trask of E-Branch were becoming just a tiny bit tedious, but that's merely a MINOR complaint of mine.  The rest of the story more than makes up for this!  I especially enjoyed how Jake dealt with his unwanted &quot;house-guest&quot; Korath.  That was a very well written sequence.  <br />Thirteen novels!  Over a decade of entertainment!  And most of all, characters that became like family members!  What more could you want?  Thank-you, Mr. Lumley.  Simply, thank-you for sharing with us the world of the Necroscope and the Wamphyri.  <br />The entire series will always have a special place in my heart.	2001-06-12

With the passing of Douglas Adams on Friday 5/11/2001, I picked up this book after quite a number of years and gave it a good ol' read....and you know what... this novel will forever be poignant, witty and downright entertaining.  I laughed all over again.  I mean, I really laughed.  I'm going to miss Douglas.<br />Douglas wasn't just at the forefront of comedy-sci-fi....he basically created the genre.  My only regret, along with quite a number of fans, is that we shall never again relish in the adventures of Arthur Dent and the gang.  No more Vogon poetry.  No more Pan Galactic Gargleblasters.  No more Babel fish.  No more tongue-twisting names.  Therein lies the real shame.<br />New readers to Douglas Adams, take heart!  Each of the novels that make up this series are all fantastic tales!  If you own a copy of Hitchhiker's, you hold in your hands a classic!  Cherish it always and read it as it was intended.... as a truly light-hearted romp through the cosmos.  <br />Take a look at some of the reviews listed here.  Over four hundred people can't be wrong.  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is without a doubt one of the greatest books of all time by a quirky and innovative author.  (We'll just have to forgive him for wearing a digital watch.)<br />Thank-you Douglas for the fun and adventures.  You were one of a kind.

This is most probably my last Jack Higgins novel.<br />There was a time when I couldn't wait for the newest book from Jack Higgins to come out.  Regrettably that time was the mid 1980's.  I have increasingly become disenchanted with his storylines and two dimensional characters.  It is perhaps time for Mr. Sean Dillon to retire from active service.  <br />As other reviewers have said, there is very little (if any) true plot to &quot;Edge of Danger&quot;.  The entire Rashid family are thin and vacuous.  Paul's motives most especially are questionable.  This novel is a complete parody of Jack's earlier (and more entertaining) works.<br />A common thread of recent Jack Higgins novels has been the very formulaic writing style...for example... a cheesy villain arrives on the scene and does something to upset Ferguson and Dillon.  Dillon takes on the job of figuring out the villain's plan.  Ferguson berates Dillon for his cavalier attitude.  Dillon has a Bushmill's.  Villain and Dillon talk and talk and talk.  Dillon somehow manages to save the day.  All along the way re-reminding readers of Dillon's past with the IRA.  You'd think after all this time Mr. Higgins would have assumed his fans know this fact.<br />Save your money on this one.  I'd love to be able to recommend it, but simply cannot.  It's a tiresome and insubstantial read.	2001-05-09

Anyone who has (or ever had) such a job will immediately recognize most of the people described within.  We all work with a Fat Bald Jeff.... admit it.<br />Addie describes herself as the female version of Austin Powers.  Fat Bald Jeff is exactly that.  He's fat.  He's bald.  He's Jeff.  Together this unlikely duo hatch a scheme to get their justifiable revenge on the shallow office managers who have very little (if any) concern for the people they work with.<br />The supporting cast of characters are likeable enough.  They do their jobs and remain in the background, allowing the author Leslie Stella to concentrate on Addie and Fat Bald Jeff.<br />Most of the other reviewers have commented on the book's general plot, so I'll just say that it's light and it's charming.  If you're looking for a gut-buster, look elsewhere.  This is a nice spring novel.  I enjoyed it immensely.<br />Well done, Ms. Stella.	2001-04-25

We have the Fifth Doctor, his companions Tegan and Turlough, the Brigadier and the return of UNIT!  What's not to like?  This novel, that's what.<br />The setting this time is Los Angeles rather than the United Kingdom.  The threat of alien invasion is imminent and the Brigadier calls once again on the help of his scientific advisor, now in his fifth incarnation. <br />What a pity that Mr. Topping didn't use the Doctor as fully as he should have with this story.  The title character is hardly in the story at all.  When we do see him, he and his old friend Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart seem to be at odds with one another.  There was some word play between the two that seemed somewhat labored and distressing.  Tegan has become a royal pain in the posterior and Turlough is subjected to a totally unnecessary alien &quot;examination&quot;.<br />The return of UNIT was also an opportunity squandered.  The characters of Paynter and Milligan were fine when they started off, but they quickly lost their charm when they started rattling off past adventures for the sake of name-dropping during their conversations with one another.  (i.e. mentions of the Giant Robot, Zygons, Harry Sullivan, John Benton, etc.)  I think this was more a first time author trying to cram in as many Unit references as possible within the confines of a shaky story to prove how savvy he is with the history of the show.<br />My BIGGEST problem came on page 169.  Milligan, Paynter and Tegan are stranded in the Nevada desert, with the lights of Las Vegas twinkling in the distance.  Milligan says something to the effect that he wants to &quot;get into one of them Las Vegas casinos and put my wad on twenty-seven black.&quot;<br />Either the author or editor has never been in a casino anywhere on the planet.  Twenty-seven is RED on a roulette table, not black.<br />By the time the Doctor finally gets involved with the story there are maybe twenty pages left for him to do what he does best.  But why is he suddenly brooding about it the entire time?<br />I really wanted to like this story, but I didn't.  I certainly wouldn't rank it as one of the worst Dr. Who novels of all time.  I think it was just a case of first time author jitters.  Keith Topping should improve given time.  I agree that this story might have benefitted with the use of a different incarnation of the Doctor.  I think it's the use of the Fifth Doctor that doesn't mesh with the rest of the tale.	2001-04-25

He has only recently lost his wife in a freak car accident and is slowly coming to terms with her absence when we join the story.  Suddenly Dix is the recipient of anonymous phone calls claiming that his wife, Katy, was unfaithful and that the caller is/was the lover.

Just as Cecca is finally rebuilding a mother/daughter relationship; she begins receiving anonymous phone calls concerning Amy's comings and goings.<br />Mr. Pronzini populates the small Californian town of Los Alegres with a number of characters.  Many of whom could be a possible candidate for the role of Tormentor to Dix and Cecca.  Who is the person and what is his motive?<br />Neither Dix nor Cecca is aware of their simultaneous problem until they speak and when members of their circle of friends begin to suffer horrendous and fatal &quot;accidents&quot;.  This is clearly the work of someone after something!  But what?!<br />&quot;The Tormentor&quot; is a fairly good read and I recommend it to those looking for something light in the waning months of winter.  There are plenty of red herrings thrown into the story to keep you guessing.... but.... common sense and systematic elimination will eventually point out the culprit to most experienced thriller readers.<br />I guess that my middle of the road review is basically for the characterizations of Dix and Cecca.  Had there been a point where I actually cared for them in the story, I may have scored this novel somewhat higher.  I was actually rooting for the &quot;mysterious&quot; tormentor during portions of the story.  Also, Dix and Cecca may want to look into a little invention by the name of &quot;Caller ID&quot;.    <br />My only other minor nitpick involves police detective Adam St. John.  Could he be any more cardboard and two dimensional?  But this is primarily for story flow and tension.  When you realize that there's very little if anything he's actually going to do... you continue reading on.  Surely, if there's a body count beginning in your home town... I would like to think the police would take a slightly more proactive role in the investigations.  Don't move to Los Alegres!<br />Still and all it's not a bad story.  2-1/2 stars leaning towards a low 3.  If there's nothing else you can find to read, &quot;The Tormentor&quot; will do in a pinch.	2001-02-14

I found Ed Gorman's collection of seventeen horror/sci-fi short stories to be something of a mixed bag.  I read them all and I found some to be quite enjoyable...while others I did not.<br />Out of this assortment of tales I enjoyed a total of seven.  So that's a  score of 7 out of 17.  Regrettably for me, quite a few of them had me thinking &quot;so-so&quot; when I was finished.<br />Of those that I really did like...the top three are:<br />1)  &quot;Of the Fog.&quot;  A classic story.  Sometimes real horror can be found in the people and things surrounding you day to day.<br />2)  &quot;Lover Boy.&quot;  This story had an &quot;Outer Limits&quot; sort of feel to it.  Just the right balance of horror and sci-fi.<br />3)  &quot;To Fit the Crime.&quot;  Another tale that is slightly reminiscent of a classic &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode or one of the newer Outer Limits.  Just desserts are granted to someone who is due.<br />The remaining stories that didn't overly thrill me are a hodge-podge of slightly spooky Westerns, sci-fi adventures and pseudo-horror.  There will probably be people who find these stories more entertaining than my personal picks.<br />This isn't a bad collection.  All the stories are an easy read.  2-1/2 stars for the seven stories that I enjoyed.	2001-02-02
US	50674172	R3HCOMIZUD897M	0843948256	677650953	Blood Crazy	Books	5	26	29	N	N	A Fantastic Story!	Congratulations to Simon Clark for the first 5 star novel I've read in 2001.  I absolutely loved &quot;Blood Crazy&quot;.  Readers will be in for one hell of a devilish ride with this brilliant story!<br />Nick Aten is the perfect hero for this tale.  An average teenager whose main delights in life are:  tinkering with his car, hanging out with his mates and a trip to the Golden Arches.  Incidentally, it's amazing how enjoyable a read Mr. Clark makes the trip for a hamburger in this story.  Nick really likes going out for his burgers.  His character is fleshed out wonderfully.<br />Everything in Nick's world is as it should be on the planet's last normal Saturday.  Come Sunday morning, though, things are completely different.  The adults of Doncaster begin the wholesale slaughter of any child under the age of 19.  It's total chaos.<br />What follows is an intense story of survival and self-realization.  Nick comes to the aid of a girl named Sarah and her two younger sisters Vicki and Anne.  They somehow manage to elude the crazed adults and find refuge with an ever-growing assortment of surviving teens and children.  Into this mixture is thrown some interior turmoil, ever increasing Napoleon complexes from would-be teen thugs, the reoccurring appearance of Nick's nemesis Slatter and a population of adults that are growing more organized as each day passes.<br />And yet, through all of this, Nick handles himself with as much courage and determination as possible.  This novel was a fantastic read.  I was disappointed to see end.  <br />Sequel, Mr. Clark!!  This story is begging for a sequel!  It would be wonderful to see where these characters end up in the future and what other obstacles stand in their way.<br />Horror fans read this one!  You will not be disappointed.	2001-01-30

What a pity it is for the reader that this lethal combination was never really used to its fullest extent. <br />British Embassy employee Geoffrey Shafer fancies himself to be one of the Four Horsemen.  Death to be precise.  He's on so many different narcotics and stabilizers that it's amazing he actually has the awareness to drive, let alone murder so many people.<br />My SMALL problem with the storyline is that Mr. Patterson; rather than delve deeper into Shafer's psychosis, spends so much useless time showing us the other members of the Horsemen.  The issue of Shafer's diplomatic immunity is thrown in ever so briefly.  Tightening the court battle sequence would have made the final showdown between Cross and Shafer a bit more compelling.  We're left with a lull in the story immediately afterwards.<br />The romance between Cross and Christine tends to slow the pace of the story.  And the characterizations of the children seem somewhat askew.  They do tend to speak far beyond their years.  But that's just a tiny nitpick.  The novel is a very easy read.<br />...  But, I'll admit, it would be fun to read about Geoffrey Shafer again.	2001-01-22

I think just about everyone is familiar with the name of Stephen J. Cannell.  If you ever turned your television on during the late 80's and early 90's, you have already experienced his style of entertainment.  Lots of gun play, explosions and over the top baddies and lackeys.<br />&quot;The Devil's Workshop&quot; tries very hard to be a suspenseful action/adventure novel... however I think it suffers from one too many story lines.  Cannell throws in so many stereotypical characters, it's silly.   All with cheesy made-for-tv names like:  &quot;Lucky&quot; Cunningham, Dexter Demille, Admiral Zoll and the completely over-the-top religious zealot/hobo/white supremacist (some combo!) Reverend Fannon Kincaid.  Also thrown into this tale are a series of disposable background characters; none of whom advance the story very much.  <br />Here's the gist of the story... the government has illegally designed a race-specific airborne virus (scary!), but it's been discovered by grieving widow/microbiologist Stacey Richardson.  The Feds try and cover up their tracks, only to have one of the creators elude their hit-squad and team up with Kincaid and his train-riding brethren.  <br />The rating of two stars is for the readability of &quot;The Devil's Workshop.&quot;  Mr. Cannell provides a fairly decent yarn, but I'm afraid he lost me at the final three pages.  No spoilers here, but, let's just say that the ending was far too trite and convenient.  This is an extremely light read for a boring plane ride or car trip.  Readers will not be taxed too greatly.	2001-01-15

If John Cleese and Graham Chapman were the brains of the creature known as Monty Python's Flying Circus, Michael Palin was definitely the heart, Terry Jones the soul and Terry Gilliam the eyes.  Eric Idle was without a doubt the voice.  His sketches were mostly word play and musical in nature.  It is his exquisite use of wordplay that shines through in the novel &quot;Road to Mars&quot;.  <br />Eric certainly had a lot of fun writing this story, and it shows.  Any Python fan worth their weight in spam can hear Mr. Idle reciting the novel in their mind as they read.  It would be unfair to compare this to anything Python did as a whole.  Eric was only 1/6th of the troupe.  So, he brings to his novel what he did with the show... entertaining characters with sharp dialogue and wacky asides.<br />The narrator's voice is pure Eric Idle.  His wicked asides throughout the novel are well timed and spaced.  Carlton, the David Bowie resembling android and his &quot;Theory of Levity&quot; make for some great chuckles.  Muscroft and Ashby are the classic comedy duo.  And then, of course, there's the entertainer/mega-diva Brenda, who as Mr. Idle states, tortures the masses by &quot;singing at them&quot;.<br />I really liked this novel.  The continuing exploration of comedy and its origins I thought were very well thought out.  Others may find this not so entertaining.  In any event, this was a fun novel.  You certainly don't have to be a fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus to enjoy it.	2001-01-15
US	50674172	RMQYJAVN3NZMK	0843947888	404564239	Among the Missing	Books	1	8	10	N	N	Reads easily but has very little substance	The only thing missing from Richard Laymon's &quot;Among the Missing&quot; is an Epilogue.  Had it contained one, this novel would have been very much like an extremely low budget episode of Barnaby Jones.<br />It's somewhat mislabeled a &quot;horror&quot; novel.  It really should be classified as a murder/mystery.  The back cover blurb sets up the tale well enough.  The story goes something like this:  Late night liaison, murder, decapitation, witnesses, police involvement, suspects, twist, resolution.  To go into details of any one of these aspects would be to ruin what story there is.  This wouldn't be fair to the reader.<br />To his credit, Mr. Laymon has a knack for writing very light prose.  This novel can be finished in just under two hours.  If you're looking for something simple and not very taxing, this is a novel that certainly fits the bill.<br />It will definitely entertain all of Laymon's fans, but if you're new to his work, this wouldn't be the best to use as a starting point.	2000-12-29
US	50674172	RO186SKYPYF9S	0843947934	18763936	Born Bad	Books	3	2	2	N	N	3-1/2 stars actually	Barry Hoffman's novel &quot;Born Bad&quot; took a little while to get moving along, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The reader is given a chance to get to know the characters very well, indeed.  This has been one of Mr. Hoffman's strong points writing-wise throughout most of his novels.<br />Shanicha Wilkins is a villainess of unique style.  She's a social chameleon that's capable of blending into her surroundings with ease.  This ability allows her to practice the psychotic pranks she likes to play; namely pushing susceptible co-eds to commit suicide.  This obsessive/compulsive lady is not the person you'd want to cheese off.  Getting on Shanicha's bad side would most probably be the last thing you do.<br />Ariel Dampier is a fine main character, although I was a little tired of Mr. Hoffman's constant reminders throughout the novel that she was half-black.  It's obviously an important issue to the story, but the whole thing gets a little tiresome when you get deep into the novel.  It is this small point that warrants my slightly low rating.  But that's just my opinion.<br />The story itself is tight and well presented.  The characters of Lucius and Chanda provide Ariel with some wonderfully crafted companions.  If you're familiar with Mr. Hoffman's work I think you will enjoy this book immensely.	2000-12-28
US	50674172	RGG2KX1MUIOZQ	0515129496	536544726	Resurrection Day	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Camelot in ruins?	Perhaps &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; by Brendan Dubois would have been a more intriguing read had the story taken place directly after the missiles started falling on America and Russia; rather than ten years after the fact.  The story itself is fairly crafted, but there's very little actual thrill to any of it.  <br />The greatest nation on the face on the planet reduced to less than second world status?  Highly improbable.  The strategic retaliations that Mr. Dubois proposes are somewhat far fetched.  I would think that the entire European community would have been brought into the war in 1962 had the events unfolded as the story would have you believe.<br />Carl Landry is a so-so protagonist.  He has mixed emotions over both aspects of his life.  Which is he truly?  A former army sergeant or a Boston newspaper reporter?  Mr. Landry himself doesn't seem to know.  He can't have it both ways.  Several times throughout the novel he detests the work he's done for his country, and equally loathes being called a &quot;quota baby&quot;.  It's either one or the other, Mr. Landry.<br />Hot zones, relief-aid from Great Britain, decon camps, poor electricity and food shortages.  All are very possible, but a decade after the war?  Yet more improbabilities.  America's farmland was providing for quite a bit of the world and then some at that time.  So, why wouldn't they have done so for their own countrymen?  According to Mr. Dubois, none of the Midwest states were even touched.  It's details like this that made portions of the story tepid.<br />The supporting cast is lightweight and all too common in these sorts of novels.  Suspicious editors and co-workers, homeless veterans with more knowledge of what actually happened during the war than most citizens, and British consulate workers and military-types with nefarious plans all their own.   <br />As far as &quot;what-if&quot; novels go, it's not too bad.  Some of the inner-storylines could have been re-worked or removed altogether.  It's a very light read for those people interested in a filler novel before your next big read.	2000-12-21

If &quot;Santa Steps Out&quot; isn't nominated for this year's Bram Stoker Award, it will certainly be a crime!  This is this year's winner, hands down! <br />Robert Devereaux does a fiendishly wicked job of casting a new, albeit perverse, light on some old friends from our childhood.<br />Know from the get-go that this novel is not for everyone!  But overall, it is a very good read!  Just when you think ol' Claus can't possibly sink any lower, we see that he can.<br />Norman Rockwell would have had a grabber if this novel had been around when he was alive.  &quot;Santa Steps Out&quot; is very much like a Salvador Dali painting that has been interpreted by Larry Flynt.  It's wicked, raunchy and in some areas truly repulsive.<br />What better compliment can one offer for this unique piece of work?<br />If you're going to read this novel, one mustn't be shy or timid.  If you can make it through the beginning, you will be compelled to finish.  And finish you must!  For Mr. Devereaux's &quot;Afterward&quot; is worth reading as well.<br />This is a novel you won't soon forget.	2000-12-11

This was the original broadcast time of Doctor Who, and he was absolutely spot-on in suggesting this!  <br />&quot;Festival of Death&quot; is a classic tale in the spirit of Doctor Who!  It feels like it would have fit in quite perfectly with that particular season of the show.  <br />The Doctor's fourth incarnation, Romana and K9 are very well presented in this story.  Several times, in fact, as the Doctor arrives on the scene having already been there!  The care with the Doctor tries to avoid his other selves is wonderfully written.  <br />The wordplay between the Doctor and Romana are pure Tom and Lalla.  The baddies (especially Metcalf) are over the top, but never too much so.  Just like many of the classic Tom Baker episodes.<br />The addition of the whacked-out hippy lizards Hoopy, Biscit and Xab was a wonderful touch.  It would be a blast to see them or their race make another appearance in a future adventure.<br />A fun story told with all the wit and whimsy of some of Tom Baker's finer stories.  Doctor Who fans will certainly enjoy this.	2000-11-28

The main character, Joe Keough, does very little (if any) actual detective work in this rather tepid novel.<br />Amazingly, both the multiple murder investigation and the events surrounding little Brady Sanders manage to solve themselves with minimal input from Detective Keough.  Joe is simply there to act on his outlandish hunches and pick up all the credit.  This comes even at the cost of a fellow officer.  But hey, it was the one detective on the force that all the men and women didn't really care for anyway, so what's the big deal, right?<br />In reality, all Joe Keough has in this story are his hunches.  He even goes so far as to tell this to his superiors and the FBI.  <br />The supporting cast of officers are ineffectual, as is the story's villain.  It is for these reasons that I cannot in good conscience recommend this novel.	2000-11-16
US	50674172	R3CIK7VVCHLR4A	0563538015	950679593	Imperial Moon (Doctor Who Series)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	A WONDERFUL BLEND OF GENRES...BUT...	Christopher Bulis' &quot;Imperial Moon&quot; starts off as a lovely homage to Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.  Britain lands on the Moon in the year 1878.  It is the Moon of early films and some early beliefs.  Dense jungle and dangerous wildlife.  Her Majesty's astral ships:  Lynx, Draco and Cygnus carry their crews into the unknown and adventure.<br />Enter the fifth incarnation of the Doctor and his companion Turlough, who discover the moon landing when they cross over their own temporal wake.  A never heard before alarm goes off within the TARDIS and the Doctor produces a small battered journal from a time safe.  It is the account of the British moon landing.<br />This adventure in and of itself was a pleasant read.  However, very much like the series of the time, the character of Kamelion was never used to his full potential.  Kamelion has the ability to assume any form set forth by its controller, but I think rather than use his imagination to its fullest extent, Mr. Bulis conveniently left poor Kamelion onboard the TARDIS with nothing to do but make the prerequisite cameo in the beginning and end.<br />Also by this time in the series, the character of Turlough had long since been an accepted member of the TARDIS crew and wasn't nearly as cowardly or self-centered as he is made out to be in &quot;Imperial Moon&quot;.  Granted, the sequence where he &quot;borrows&quot; the journal of Captain Richard Haliwell in order to impress the Doctor by his leadership skills was a dead-on interpetation.  It's just that some of the other Turlough sequences I found to be lacking.  On the plus side for Turlough, there's even a possible love interest in the form of an alien named Lytalia.  She is a member of the Phiadoran race.  I think Turlough really wants to impress this woman I more than the Doctor.  He's smitten.<br />This isn't really a spoiler I think, but... something I feel that needs to be addressed.  I was having a fun time reading this novel until the Doctor resorts tousing a blaster in a most un-Doctor-like way.  But, that's not really fair, per se to the novel.  The fifth incarnation had no hesitation picking up a blaster in the series, most notably in &quot;Earthshock&quot; and &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;.  Rather than having the villain(s) do themselves in as a result of their own nastiness, as was the case in almost every fourth incarnation adventure, the fifth incarnation goes &quot;Rambo&quot;.... which doesn't mesh with the rest of this story.  I could have done without this poorly scripted section.  It was as if Mr. Bulis said, &quot;Let's just end this now and tidy up loose ends.&quot;<br />Fifth Doctor novels I pick up without hesitation, as I enjoyed Peter Davison's tenure greatly.  This installment, though, felt hurried at the end.  It could have been an actual episode.  One that I think would have fit nicely into the history of the series.  However, it's missing the charm of the fifth Doctor.  I agree with another reviewer that he was only a supporting character and not the star.<br />It's still a fun read.  3-1/2 stars .... it lost a 1/2 star due to some minor items.  This certainly will not disappoint most Who fans.	2000-09-24

He is definitely an author who has mastered the credo:  \\"Write  what you know.\\"  I was never a student of either of these schools, but  after reading \\"Sea of Change\\", I feel as though I have just completed about  fourteen credit hours in Advanced Oceanography/Biology Studies.  It's this  attention to detail that merits the well-deserved three stars.  \\"Sea of  Change\\" is a very well written novel.<br />Doctor Ellie Bridges is on duty  during the graveyard shift at a small Pacific Northwest hospital when she  is delivered the bodies of two poachers, fished out of the water by local  Indian residents.  The wounds on the poachers are unlike anything Dr.  Bridges has ever seen.  Not long afterwards, a very sick young girl is  brought in by distraught parents.  Despite her attempts, the young girl  also dies.   Ellie is out of her depth as a medical  professional.<br />Meanwhile, out at sea aboard the Exeter, oceanographer  Brock Garner and his team of scientists are nearly run into by what appears  to be an abandoned ship, the Sato Maru.  A quick survey of the derelict  reveals the crew long since dead and in various states of decomposition.   What's happening?  From here the body count begins to slowly rise.  Man and  mammal alike are turning up dead.  Among the dead is Brock's former  brother-in-law Mark Junkers.  Brock is called in for help by his ex-wife  Carol who wants answers to her brother's death.  He is regrettably teamed  up with Carol's new husband, smiling Bob Nolan.  Suffice it to say that  neither man gets along very well.<br />Mr. Powlick gives us a great cast of  characters here.  There was sufficient enough development in them that  warranted my reading this novel to its conclusion.  <br />My middle of the  road review concerns their nemesis.  Try as they might, even this cast  couldn't make the hunt for Pfiesteria overly exciting.  When they're not  onboard the Kaikuarguing over every little thing, the crew is searching  the ocean for a floating slick of a biological nature.  From an ecological  standpoint, I thoroughly understand what the author's intent was, and it is  admirable.<br />What I really wish I could have given this novel was three and  a half stars for its engaging writing with a heavy emphasis on marine  biology.  There's also a nice \\"tip-of-the-pen\\" to a rather famous novel by  Peter Benchley that I found entertaining.  Clearly a little something for  everyone can be found in \\"Sea Change\\".  Give it a read.	2000-09-19

It's difficult to come into an established series and feel comfortable right from the get-go.  In reading &quot;Extreme Odds&quot;, I feel as  though I'm missing out on the returning characters because I hadn't read  any of the earlier adventures featuring Adam McCleet.  Nevertheless, Mr.  Hanson's book &quot;Extreme Odds&quot; was enjoyable.  <br />We get to know  our intrepid detective-turned-sculptor Adam McCleet very quickly.  When we  first meet up with him and his substitute father, Max Faverman, they are on  their way to visit Max's son Buddy.  Buddy is the mastermind behind the  creation of a brand new country.  The country of &quot;Bob&quot;.  Why  would someone want to start their own country?  And even more to the point,  why name it Bob?  You'll have to read this story to find out!<br />The country  of Bob counts amongst its citizens:  a paranoid-conspiracy-theory-believing  Reverend,  a radio vixen obsessed with Wayne Newton, a gorgeous organic  farmer whose crops run towards the illegal, a Head of Security with a  Napoleon complex the size of Oregon and a mysterious ninja pajama-clad man  named Spanky who appears out of nowhere on a dazzling white horse.<br />Add to  this a group of rather perturbed federal agents waiting outside the gates  of Bob... a soon to open casino... several murders... an errant hydrogen  bomb... and you get most of the main ingredients of &quot;Extreme  Odds&quot;.<br />There are some light hearted chuckles to be had throughout  this tale.  I won't say that it's a side-splittingly funny novel... it's  just cute.  A light read that I finished in one sitting.	2000-08-24
US	50674172	R379JV1G3VSQX6	0451198514	808665909	Stealing Faces	Books	3	89	95	N	N	A very high three and a half stars	I must admit that Michael Prescott has a knack for writing a very entertaining prologue!  Readers arrive on the scene smack dab in the middle  of single mom Sharon Andrews bloodied and running for her life.   Unfortunately for Sharon, she's in the prologue...we know what's going to  happen to her.  And very quickly, so does she.<br />From a writing standpoint  &quot;Stealing Faces&quot; is crisp and reads quickly.  A definite plus in  this form of novel.  The major players of the story are deftly crafted.   Poor Elizabeth Palmer, a.k.a. Ellen Pendleton , a.k.a. Paula Nielson, but  in reality Kaylie McMillan has been on the run for the better part of  twelve years.  She is of the opinion that Dr. John Cray is the unstoppable  White Mountain Killer.  She's absolutely correct, of course.  She's also  the murderess of her husband Justin McMillan.  What Cray does as the White  Mountain Killer is rather obvious from the book's title.<br />Kaylie and Cray  play a lot of physical tag in the first portion of the novel.  Each trying  to remain one step ahead of the other.  They spend the second half of the  novel playing mental tag.  Kaylie and Cray encounter several other  interesting people in the course of the story.  Namely, Tucson Detective  Roy Shepherd and Kaylie's ex-father-in-law Anson McMillan.  <br />My only ever  so MINUSCULE complaint is that they really weren't given any more to do but  play hide and seek with one another.  To go any further into what precisely  goes on would be to give away too many spoilers in this well written novel.   It's just that things become a bit formulaic towards the end.  Cray makes  a mistake or two that seem out of character for someone who throughout the  rest of the story takes great pride in his meticulousness.<br />This still  does not take away from the fact that there are some clever twists and  turns in this story.  A fast read that I think many people will find very  enjoyable.	2000-08-11

Mr. Prescott did a fantastic job of  breathing life into Abby.  Readers of &quot;The Shadow Hunter&quot; will  encounter a very strong woman with a sharp mind and a conscience that won't  let her ever forget the one evening she lost a client.  A mistake she does  not intend to make a second time.<br />Newscaster Kris Barwood is the  &quot;Six Million Dollar Woman&quot; of the television airwaves.  She  delivers her news broadcasts at six and ten o'clock every evening to the  residents of Los Angeles and Hollywood.  However, much to her chagrin,  there's Raymond Hickle out there who believes that she is speaking directly  to him.  Hickle is an obsessive fan.  A stalker.  He wants nothing more  than to have Kris in his life.  If he can't have that, he'd rather she be  dead.  <br />As the story moves along we are given a very close look into the  life of a fan turned stalker.  Hickle tapes every newscast.  He has written  to all the stations in Mrs. Barwood's career requesting photographs.  He  even has copies of her high school year books and birth certificate.   <br />Abby is assigned by her employer to infiltrate Hickle's life and keep  tabs on the under-achieving loony.  She moves into the apartment right next  door and begins to converse with Raymond.  Something he is not used to.   His affections are now in a quandary.  Who is he more likely to pursue?   Unreachable Kris or his new neighbor Abby?<br />Mr. Prescott proceeds to take  us on a twisted journey.  Revealing to us the thought processes and planned  actions of a stalker.  The pacing is fantastic.  A swift and energetic  read.<br />To make Abby's life and assignment a little more difficult, there's  someone that's helping Raymond Hickle along!  He's got a supporter out  there speaking to him via email.  There are enough red herrings in this  story that will have most readers suspecting various other key players.   This was a fabulous touch.<br />I had not read any of Mr. Prescott's other  novels.  But I intend to check them out.  I agree wholeheartedly that Abby  Sinclair needs to be brought back in a future novel.  She is a sharp and  very believable character that deserves to come back and entertain readers  yet again.  This treatment of Abby makes for a nice change of pace from  some of the more two dimensional so called heroines in books today.<br />A  great book that reads easily.  Give this one a try.  <br />Excellent work, Mr.  Prescott!	2000-08-08

There are quite a number of hits as  well as misses.  Readers will span the globe following the tale's many  characters.  Some are beautifully brought to life, while others were  somewhat flat.  There is a clear cut group of heroes and villains.   <br />Despite the wonderfully crafted heroes in this story, I was surprised to  find myself more interested in the fiendish doings of Alexander Dubov and  his band of evil men.  Dubov is a first class techno-thriller baddie.   Should Mr. Powell continue this storyline in subsequent books, it would be  fun to read more about this character.  Friar Clarke and Bryan Warner are  red blooded heroes of the highest caliber.  Their talent, perseverance and  love of country come through beautifully.  <br />So why the mediocre  rating?<br />It comes down to pacing.  There's quite a bit of chatter between  the principal players.  When there's action to be read...this novel moves  along briskly.  Some of the petty bickering between Clarke, Warner and NSA  director Bastardi tends to run a little long.<br />The title and the  aforementioned quatrain are the only references to Nostradamus, though.   Readers thinking that this novel is deeply rooted in the prophecies may  find it a bit of a disappointment.<br />This novel really should get 3 and a ½  stars.  It was an enjoyable read, but ended rather abruptly.  I'd certainly  give another book of John S. Powell a chance.	2000-08-03
US	50674172	RPZQ08CSJ2WT5	0451200152	728640065	The Town	Books	1	6	7	N	N	The Shining on peyote.	I was greatly disappointed by Bentley Little's novel \\"The Town\\".  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if readers walk away from this novel with a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling.  It's horror novel déjà vu!    <br />We've already read (and viewed) the story lines that Mr. Little has  \\"creatively borrowed\\" from.<br />Gregory Tomasov wins the California lottery  giving him the opportunity to relocate his wife, three children and his  overtly religious (also mega-superstitious) mother to his childhood home of  McGuane, Arizona.  They move into a house that is rumored by the locals to  be haunted.  Maybe this rumor was started when the home's prior tenant  killed his entire family there!  But what do I know?<br />The residents of  McGuane are the same tired retreads one comes to expect from this type of  story.  Characters come and go, leaving us with very little to remember or  care about.  The regular town-folk are leery and suspicious of the Molokan  Russians living there, and vice versa.<br />Descriptively you can't fault Mr.  Little.  He describes the Arizona backdrop beautifully.  It's a shame that  the same can't be said for the overabundance of second-hand characters in  McGuane.  <br />People we never really get a chance to know are being killed  off in short vignettes that serve as breaks in a chapter or scene.  The 2nd  most ridiculous of which is the death of the Molokan priest, Jim Petrovin.   This is hardly a spoiler as it takes place on page 91.  He is dispatched by  his own bible that has taken flight (with the covers flapping like wings)  in his own church.  <br />What would be the 1st?  Read the vignette on the  bottom of page 58.  Though an interesting scene, it was thoroughly  ridiculous.<br />Of all the members of the Tomasov family:  Gregory, Julia,  Sasha, Adam, Teo and their \\"Babunya\\" Agafia, the only one I found myself  caring for was Adam.  Like his siblings, he's been removed from a life he  enjoyed without any input and forced to move with his family.  <br />All this  takes place during a transition time for the boy.  His thirteenth birthday.   Regrettably, even this story line gets more than a little creepy with his  sudden incestuous feelings for his older sister, Sasha.  <br />We are told  many times throughout the novel that certain scenes and events were \\"like a  horror movie&quot; or \\"like a scene out of a horror novel&quot;.  <br />This  is even made a point in the story from a thought by Adam himself on page  344.  The sentence reads:  \\"They were like stupid movie people, he  realized.\\"<br />He's not kidding.  <br />My sincere hope is that \\"The Town\\" was  one of those stories that Mr. Little simply had to get out of his head and  onto paper, so that he might move on to a more entertaining story somewhere  in the future.<br />Diehards of his work will no doubt enjoy it.  It does have  it's moments, but those are too far and few between.  I've enjoyed some of  the other novels Bentley has written.  I'm sorry to say that this was not  one of them.	2000-07-19

No sooner had I finished the paperback version of &quot;Florida Roadkill&quot; when I noticed that the second installment &quot;Hammerhead Ranch Motel&quot; had come out in hardback.  I was not disappointed in the  slightest.  These two novels have really made my summer!<br />Serge A. Storms  returns amidst a plethora of new freakazoids for everyone to enjoy!  His  newest sidekick is a Don Johnson impersonator named Lenny Lippowicz.  When  not schmoozing the 2012 Olympic Committee, these two are scouring the  Hammerhead Ranch Motel's parking lot for moon rocks to peddle on the open  market.  <br />Along the way we meet a sultry pair of ladies nicknamed  &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Country&quot;.  Johnny Vegas also returns as the  world's most unfortunate virgin.  We also meet Harvey Fiddlebottom, a.k.a.  Zargoza and witness his ongoing dealings with the reasonably violent Diaz  Boys.  And let's not forget  Paul, the Passive-Aggressive Private Eye, the  dangerous Mrs. Edna Ploomfield, the incredible shrinking Mayor Malcolm  Kefauver and Toto the dancing weather dog! <br />With the exception of the  first two paragraphs in the prologue, the story spends very little time  dealing with the past novel.  It starts off with a bang and never lets up!   It's fast and furious, very much like Serge on one of his hyperkinetic  Florida benders.<br />I think one of the funnier lines has to be ...&quot;The  Florida Marlins had just won the World Series, whose rich celebratory  tradition often peaks with fans mistaking police cruisers for  pinatas.&quot;<br />I also thoroughly enjoyed the sequence involving the  National Guard vs. Clown College Students during an Antiwar demonstration.   A totally wild and insane visual that had me rolling with laughter.<br />This  novel is a kamikaze mixed by a demonically wicked bartender.  I cannot  recommend this novel enough!  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll groan...but  I guarantee you will not regret reading &quot;Hammerhead Ranch Motel&quot;.    <br />In fact, buy two copies in case you wish to read it a second time and  beware of Hemingways falling from the skies!	2000-07-17

Tim Dorsey's &quot;Florida Roadkill&quot; is hands down, without a doubt, one of the funniest novels I've read in years!  I was laughing by page two!<br />The narrative is fast-paced and top notch.  The plot is devilishly  multi-layered and engaging.  Mr. Dorsey populates his delightfully demented  Floridian world with the most whacked out collection of loonies ever  assembled.  <br />Serge A. Storms is a character that readers will remember  for some time.  Mentally unbalanced and a font of trivial pursuit-esque  knowledge.  <br />Coleman, Serge's sidekick, is a whack-a-loon of the highest  caliber.  There's a seen involving Coleman, an almost successful bank  robbery and a poorly hidden dye-pack that had me laughing till my sides  hurt.  Clearly a scene that could easily be adapted for the big screen by  the Farrelly brothers!<br />The supporting cast of nut-jobs really flesh this  novel out!  To name but only a few....Sharon Rhodes.  Johnny Vegas.  The  Riders of Eternal Doom, Sunshine Chapter.  Fred McJagger and his  beleaguered residents of Vista Isles.  Mo Grenadine.  And let's not forget  the world's worst drug cartel!<br />Throw into this mix a suitcase with $5  million in cash and you get a novel that's some bizarre emulsion of a Monty  Python sketch, Clerks, Pulp Fiction and &quot;It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad  World&quot;!<br />The inference that this novel is remiscent of Hiaasen is a  very nice sentiment and well deserved.  However, Tim Dorsey is a writer of  his own unqiue style of prose and humor.  I EAGERLY await &quot;Hammerhead  Ranch Motel&quot;!	2000-06-27

From the first page all the way to the final one, Andy McNab's &quot;Remote Control&quot; was a gripping and fantastic read.<br />Readers will follow the main character of Nick Stone from Gilbraltar to London and  then on to the United States.  While on what is termed a &quot;deniable  assignment&quot;, Nick contacts a former SAS colleague, only to find upon  his arrival at their home that Kev and his family have been brutally  murdered.  All but one.... their seven year old daughter Kelly.<br />This  story never loses its pace.  Nick and Kelly are on the run from people  trying to kill them at every turn.  But it's the growing relationship  between Nick and Kelly that I find truly memorable.  <br />At first Nick tries  his best to protect the young girl from the forces closing in on them, only  to slowly find himself growing to rely on Kelly with every turn of the  page. <br />I totally agree that this is a &quot;can't put down&quot; novel.   Your heart will race at the clever twists and turns McNab has crafted.  The  supporting cast of characters are highly developed.  From the dangerous IRA  hitmen, to Stone's British employers at The Firm, to fellow SAS members Pat  and Euan, all the way to the federally relocated mobster Big Al DeNiro.   Each is a living, breathing character adding to the tension and  brilliant  storyline!<br />This is a novel that begs a sequel so readers can see what  further developments take place between Nick and Kelly.  They are two  unforgettable characters!<br />Very well done, Mr. McNab!	2000-06-22

Some people eat food that's not good for them.  Others wear clothes that are not color coordinated.  I sometimes read a Doctor Who novel. <br />I've always had  a soft spot in my heart(s) for the sixth incarnation of the Doctor.   Just  as I was getting to like him, the BBC did away with Colin.  <br />The Doctor  is at his &quot;multi-colored-pompous-best&quot; in this story.  But it's  the fun pompous incarnation of the Doctor and not the more acerbic one that  has appeared in some of the other novels in this series.  You can just hear  Colin Baker saying the lines throughout the novel.  Author Justin Richards  really got the character down!  <br />There's also all the wonderful wordplay  between the Doctor and companion Peri.  These novels tend to flesh out the  ongoing relationship between the two that never really got a chance to  flourish on the television show.  A nice touch, I thought. <br />People are  dying on the remote island of Dorsill.  Whether it be by flu or by  accidents.... there is strangeness about.  And what's with the sheep and  chickens?   And why is a recently deceased fisherman emerging from his  grave?  You'll have to read this novel to find out.     <br />I had a fun time  with this adventure.  I think this story would have made a fine midseason  episode.  One of those that is low on the sci-fi and high on setting and  characterization.<br />One of the best lines in the book.... &quot; A walking  corpse knocks at the door in the small hours and you call it a teething  problem?&quot;<br />Fans of the sixth incarnation will get a kick out of this.	2000-06-19

US	50674172	RJA1H322MMIRS	0843946830	918151682	The Poker Club	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Sterotype central.	To call &quot;The Poker Club&quot; a horror title is a grand misnomer.  I totally agree with another reviewer that this really should have been listed as a crime title.  <br />To it's credit &quot;The Poker Club&quot; is a  very fast and easy read.  What a pity that there was no real payoff by the  novel's conclusion.<br />What suprised me most was Mr. Gorman's use of every  ethnic and racial sterotype imaginable.  Our hero, Aaron Tyler tells us  himself through his clumsy first person narrative that he is the token  WASP, Curtis is the token black, Neil is the token Jew and Bill is the  token Catholic.  Or that's what he'll have you believe that's what they  call themselves to one another.  Do you know of anyone who would actually  talk like that?  <br />The sterotypes don't stop there.  We read them when  describing the residents of &quot;rough&quot; neighborhoods in Aaron's  small Midwestern town and in describing the carnies working at the fair.   If as much thought went into the plot as the racial profiling, there might  have been a nub of a tale worth telling.<br />Detective Patterson apparently  knows what went down with the men, yet does no real police work to get them  to talk.  &quot;When you're ready to tell the truth...&quot;  &quot;Stop  lying to me...&quot;  make up a major portion of her speaking lines.  Any  police officer out there reading this novel would be insulted by her poor  procedural tactics.  <br />Aaron and his friends are supposed neighborhood  saints turned sinners.  There is nothing redeeming or memorable about any  of these men.  I half-expected these dreaded six words after the final  sentence . . . &quot;And we lived happily ever after.&quot;   That's the  sort of feel the novel has by the end.<br />There are plenty of other good  novels out there that will, no doubt, entertain you more.  Leave this one  on the shelf.	2000-06-08

Harry relies heavily on &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios rather than strategically viable possibilities to get his story going.  Long before the  Chinese army even reaches the shores of America, there were far too many  implausible events that would not have gone unchallenged by foreign  governments.  <br />Not to reveal too many spoilers here, but....with the  current attention being paid to India and Pakistan, it's hard to imagine  that neither of these countries wouldn't have hesitated to use a nuclear  solution against the Chinese.  <br />Invasion implies that only the Israelies  would have gone with tactical nuclear weapons, only then to stop and  surrender when China retaliates by obliterating Tel Aviv?  While this may  be a distinct possibility...I think the European community would have  joined in the war at this point to stop China's advancement.<br />That having  been said, this is a very intriguing novel.  It's just that I found the  defense of American shores to be less than convincing and compelling read.   A much fuller story could have been written about the residents of our  southern states (and all the others for that matter) taking up arms in  defense.  If the shores of this nation were indeed threatened, in the way  this story indicates, any citizen not already in the military would have  defended the lines with everything they had.  Nor do I believe America  would fight a &quot;defensive&quot; war on its own territory.  Anyone who  has played a game of Risk knows that the only way to win is to be  aggressive and not defensive.  Some of the battle sequences were rather  limited in that regard. <br />We are given plenty of characters to care and  root for throughout the campaign.  From our commander-in-chief and his  staff (fighting off a potential coup), to the First Daughter and her  platoon on the front lines, and also the fierce Green Berets hidden behind  enemy lines with orders to drive back the invaders.  There is plenty of  action to be had in this story, I will grant the author that! <br />The  tensions are high.  Young American troops are lost.  Chinese soldiers are  arriving in unbelievable numbers on a daily basis!  I think that this novel  will be an interesting read for many, and a marginal disappointment for  those who are fans of political/militaristic novels.  <br />It's no  &quot;Executive Orders&quot;... but a very fine read that stands on its  own.	2000-06-06

Simmer this concoction for 392 pages and  ENJOY!<br />Simon Clark's novel was an absolute treat to read!  He takes his  time with the main characters and presents us with very honest,  three-dimensional people.  Chris, Ruth and David are people everyone  already knows.  I found that to be a wonderful touch.<br />The supporting cast  living in the sea-side town of Out-Butterwick are a fascinating collection  of characters.  Each with their own unique twist.<br />Without giving away any  spoilers, I thoroughly enjoyed Clark's weaving of the different story lines  in the early chapters.  This laid down a very firm foundation as the rest  of the story evolved.  Everything layered nicely!<br />If this is Clark's  first published work in America, I most certainly want to read more!   <br />(My only ever-so teeny-tiny issue deals with our main characters and the  townspeople within the sea-fort.  Didn't these people ever hear of a  cell-phone! )<br />In comparison to some of the other horror titles that I  have recently read and reviewed, it stands head and shoulders above quite a  number of them.  I recommend this novel highly.<br />Let's hit the beach!  But  not the one on Out-Butterwick.  At least, not right now.	2000-05-31

All the tales had a wonderfully unique writing style.  Some were  very pulp-esque, while others displayed some great straightforward  narration!  <br />The rating should actually be 3 and 1/2 stars.  I would have  gone higher, but some of the shorts simply weren't my cup o' tea.  But that  doesn't mean someone else won't like them! <br />Not bad at all.  A fun and  interesting collection.	2000-05-24

Having just completed it, I wish that I had passed it by yet again.<br />&quot;One Rainy Night&quot; is a very quick read.  I finished it in more or less one  sitting.  Normally that's a good thing, and  I will credit Richard Laymon's  ability to create story flow.  However... he left so many gaping holes and  unexplored avenues throughout the novel that it became tedious less than  halfway through.    <br />One of my major problems with this novel was  dialogue.  The character of Kara may be nine years old in the story, but  her lines are those of someone well along in years.  And how many high  schoolers do you know that refer to kids as &quot;ankle-biters&quot;?     <br />I can see the parallel one other reviewer had with this novel resembling  a George Romero movie.  Although I find &quot;One Rainy Night&quot; to be  more like the film &quot;The Crazies&quot; than any of the &quot;Living  Dead&quot; films.<br />Rape are gore are prominent throughout the novel.  This  may have been meant to be shocking..but after a while you'll notice that's  all there is.  A half-hearted attempt at splatterpunk.  If this is  indicative of the rest of Richard Laymon's work, I'll most probably pass  those by as well.<br />Readers may want to check out the horror classic  &quot;The Fog&quot; by James Herbert.  A significantly better novel by a  master story teller.	2000-03-15

I found &quot;The 37th Mandala&quot; to be pleasingly reminiscent of Clive Barker's &quot;The Great &amp; Secret Show&quot;.  It was a delightfully wicked and creepy read.  <br />The Mandalas are reminiscent of another  creation of Mr. Barker's, as well!  There's that same feel and setting as  with the puzzle box and the Cenobites.<br />The care with which Marc Laidlaw  takes with his characters and their surroundings shows on every page.  The  depiction of Tuol Sleng was eerily accurate.       <br />I think readers will  enjoy getting to know Derek Crowe most of all.  A sneak, scoundrel and  opportunist who does not understand the series of events he's set into  motion.<br />The supporting cast of characters is intriguing as well as  engaging.<br />Should you get a chance to read this book, I do not think you  will be disappointed.	2000-03-10

Dan Schmidt wants readers and just about EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in the novel to know that our hero, Jantzen, used to be a cop.<br />He tells his wife  Mary he used to be a cop, he tells the bitter small town sheriff, the  deputies, the patrons of his restaurant, his neighbors, the grizzled old  newspaper reporter, his drinking buddy (brilliantly named Buddy), FBI  Colonel Wiley, the television reporter and he even tells the novel's  nemesis (the cult leader) of his former occupation.<br />At one point, Mary  has to remind Jantzen that he used to be a cop!  Enough already!  By the  time this issue is hammered into us, there is very little (if any) story to  be read.<br />We are given this nugget of information so many times that on  Page 275, Colonel Wiley says, &quot;Don't keep reminding me of that.&quot;   Amen, Colonel!  What a pity this does not happen.  We are reminded yet  another three times on pages 304,320 and 335.<br />And isn't it a remarkable  coincidence that the exact same satanic cult who murdered our protagonist's  first wife and child should appear and set up shop in the very same small  town Jantzen now resides in?  <br />With the cardboard characters that occupy  this tiny dust bowl community, the reader will gladly hope they all are  offered up to whatever demonic deity this cult worships.<br />Trite dialogue  abounds throughout this book.  &quot;We need your fear.&quot;  &quot;We are  legion.&quot;  This from our cult members.  If they are intelligent enough  to infiltrate a small town and remain hidden, why can't they string  together a coherent thought? <br />There is ham-fisted action as well.  The  climax is nothing short of a really bad made-for-tv movie.  You can just  see the credits rolling over the last scene just before it breaks to your  local newscast.<br />You will read a few poorly written scenes that involve  random acts of violence, murder, pet and cattle mutilation, kidnapping, a  truly tasteless teenage torture sequence, drug induced rages and a  shoot-out involving just about every resident of the town.<br />The horror  genre has infinitely better novels to offer out there.  Your money and time  is better spent elsewhere.	2000-01-25

The character of Mark Jantzen doesn't want anyone to EVER forget he used to be a cop.<br />He tells his wife Mary, the bitter small-town Sheriff, the  patrons of his diner, his drinking buddy (also brilliantly named Buddy),  the grizzled old newspaper reporter, Colonel Wiley of the FBI, catholic  priest Father McMartin, and the &quot;fiendish&quot; leader of the Satanic  cult that is the tale's nemesis.  At one point, Mark's own wife, has to  remind him (and us!) of his former occupation!  <br />Readers will have to  wait until page 275 before Wiley says, &quot;Don't keep reminding me of  that.&quot;<br />Mark, or the author Dan Schmidt, pays no heed to this  request.  We get to read it THREE more times on pages 304, 320 and 335!   All right!  He used to be a cop!  Get on with it!<br />The Satanic cult's  infiltration and seduction of Newton's residents is half-hearted at best.   &quot;We need your fear&quot;.  &quot;We are legion&quot;.  &quot;We offer  you, Lord of Darkness, her body and soul.&quot; Zzzzzzzzzzz.  This cult  will corrupt you, but only through boring prose!<br />However gruesome or  horrific Mr. Schmidt meant his cult to be is quite simply lost on the sad  collection of sophomoric characters that populate this town.  Our ex-cop is  hardly the hero, even going so far as to resort to Rambo-style tactics in  order to save the day.<br />The story simply stops.  It is as if the author  had simply run out of gas, or was quickly approaching deadline.  The ending  scene brings to mind a very cheesy made-for-tv movie.<br />Horror readers are  better off looking elsewhere.  This is by no stretch a horror tale.  <br />By  the way, in case you don't figure it out upon reading, Mark used to be a  cop!	2000-01-19

Let's see, we have our secretly wealthy hero who opts for a simple life in a cabin  along with the wolf he rescued as a cub. (Now, that's original!)  We have  the grizzled Army Colonel, the shifty sun-glass wearing government agent,  the tired old professor/mentor, the cookie-cut-out female character, the  team of haggard commandoes, and OH!  . . . who oh who could the creature  really be!   Each and every one of these characters aren't worth the time  of day.  They are totally forgettable!<br />Do not let the back cover blurbs  lure you into reading this paperback!<br />&quot;Lightning-quick tale...&quot;   Hardly.  Long winded prose and inane dialogue, more  like.<br />&quot;Riveting...Non-stop action and terror...&quot;  Not at  all.<br />I have never written a review quite so brash before.  Save your  money for a better novel out there.  If this were ever to appear on the big  screen, I'll wager the reviews will be ONE BIG THUMBS DOWN.<br />I'd give this  thing zero stars if I could.  I wish I could have that day and a half of my  life back so that I might read something of substance.	1999-11-30
