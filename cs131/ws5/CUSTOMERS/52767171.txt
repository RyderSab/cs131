John Armstrong is both a railroader and a railroad modeler. He wrote &quot;Railroad: What it Is, What it Does&quot; to help modelers create realistic layouts by understanding how a real railroad operates. But it doesn't matter if you're a modeler: whatever your reason, if you want to know how railroads operate, then this book is for you!<br />Armstrong covers every aspect of railroading. Starting with history as far back as the Roman Empire, he surveys the evolution of rail transport from mining cars on wooden tracks through the &quot;big steel rail&quot;. He covers the pros and cons of flat wheels on flanged track versus flanged wheels on flat track, stone ties versus timber ties, steel rails versus iron rails, and all of the engineering issues that go into building a stable, long-lasting track--and that's just in the first few chapters.<br />From there he explains the economic issues that go into deciding where to run the track, how to route the trains, and everything that goes into establishing a railroad operation.<br />Finally he covers all the details: how a consist is put together; the various cars and their construction; the railroad workers and their various jobs.<br />This is one of the few books that leaves me feeling like I know all about the subject. It's incredible how he packs so much knowledge into these few pages! He obviously knows, and loves, his subject. And he writes with a storyteller's flair, so it's more like a novel than a text--I was sorry when it was finished!<br />Do yourself a favor. If you have any interest in trains whatsoever, get this book. You'll read it more than once.	2004-04-22

While it's easy to see that the world's one-sided condemnation of Israel is unjust, it's much harder to formulate a good, clear explanation WHY it is unjust. Dershowitz does a masterful job of stating the case that Israel has a right to exist, and that though she isn't always right, she has a matchless track record of upholding Palestinians' rights and dignity even while defending herself from the ones that have chosen terror as their weapon.<br />The book devotes each chapter to one myth about the state of Israel. Such myths include, \\"Israel is guilty of genocide,\\" \\"The Palestinians are ready to compromise, but Israel refuses,\\" and many more. Dershowitz illustrates each myth using a quotation from enemies of Israel including Yasser Arafat, Noam Chomsky, Edward Said, and others. Then he offers a clear, logical argument debunking the myth.<br />Two things make the book just a little repetitive. First, the anti-Israeli myths have large overlap. Does Israel commit genocide? Does she have expansionist aims? Is she the moral equivalent of Nazi Germany? Many of these myths really demand the same answer. Thus we are reminded repeatedly that Israel voluntarily returned Sinai (with its oil fields) to Egypt, voluntarily returned land claimed by Jordan, offered the Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for a promise of peace (which Syria refused), and offered self-rule, including control of the Arab quarter in Jerusalem, to the Palestinian Authority, only to see Arafat reject the offer without so much as a counter-offer, and kick off the \\"second intifadah.\\"<br />Reading these same facts again and again, in response to the many overlapping attacks against Israel, is both a weakness and a strength. It can make the narrative drag at times, but it also serves to reinforce the core argument: Israel's record on human rights is one of the best in history--it is hardly one of the worst in history as Israel's critics love to claim.<br />The whole is held together by Dershowitz's beautiful, crisp writing. I heartily recommend it to everyone. Buy several, and give them to your children and friends in college!	2004-04-22

I was a UNIX developer/admin with absolutely no VMS experience at all, and needed to get up to speed fast. This book really came through and saved my bacon.<br />The book covers all the basics you need to get up and running with VMS. Logging in, navigating the filesystem, editing files and writing DCL scripts. I already knew ANSI C programming, which this book doesn't cover, and used the VMS help system and Google searches to discover what I needed to know about the programming libraries. The book didn't cover those deeper programming topics, but it gave me all the tools I needed to find my way around the system, edit my programs, compile and run them. It really was a lifesaver.	2003-01-01

Instead, it's full of self-indulgent fluff.<br />Ms. Reed sets the tone in chapter 1: &quot;Sources: Where I Think Fiction Comes From&quot;. True to its title, the chapter is mostly a bunch of personal opinion--generally vague, mystical ones like, &quot;Be willing to bring everything you know and are to the typewriter&quot;. The only truly useful point in the chapter is also an obvious point: fiction comes from the writer's experiences.<br />The book also contains some useful information about writing. But the useful information is all fairly obvious: either inane observations or else the same suggestions you will find in a hundred other books on writing. Nothing that really makes it worth plunging through the &quot;I thinks&quot; and the personal anecdotes--unless you are as fascinated with Kit Reed as Kit Reed seems to be.	2002-01-19

The days of persecution were over, everyone thought; the Church was now not only legal, but sanctioned by the Emperor himself. Bishops dined in the Emperor's palace, at his own table, and they later compared it to sitting down with Christ himself to dine. A new golden age had begun.<br />But reaching the top brings its problems. Church politics--nasty enough, at times--had suddenly merged with the politics of Empire. The Emperor's favor came at a price, and Constantine sat in Church councils fully expecting his word to carry authority. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, was given great political power--and used it to blackmail Constantine, earning himself exile twice.<br />``When Jesus Became God'' is a gripping history of the ``Arian controversy'': a theological debate which was bursting with political consequences. Who should rule the church? What is its relation to the state? How should the church deal with its ``heretics''?<br />This debate became a turning point in history: when the church went from illegal to legal; from persecuted to persecutor; from anti-state to a political force which outlived the state itself, reigning as mistress of the world until the 19th century.<br />Rubenstein captures all of this and more in his gripping account, ``When Jesus became God.''	2002-01-07

It's clearly written, and gave a pretty good overall feel for the way that copyright law works. So it's still on my shelf, and I don't feel bad about the little bit it cost me.<br />But...<br />Exactly as the title suggests, the book is a series of questions and their answers. Although there is a sort of progression from question to question, there is no index, no table of contents, and no real grouping of questions into categories. So if I have a specific question, it would be very hard to find the answer in this book.<br />Overall, I'd say it's a decent read, but a very poor reference.	2002-01-07

It's not only a mystery novel, but partly a spy thriller: you get two for the  price of one. Rabbi Small and his wife spend the summer in Israel, where a  professor from their home town is murdered and a boy from their home town  (now attending Yeshiva in Israel) is blamed. The murder, it turns out, is  connected with a Druze conspiracy to steal a PLO weapons cache--which  naturally brings the Mossad and Shin Bet into the picture. Simply  gripping.<br />At the same time, Harry Kemelman tries to use Rabbi Small as a  foil to discuss the state of modern Judaism. He explains the Jewish customs  which come up in his novel, by making Small explain them to his gentile  friends--or argue about them with other Jews. And he doesn't just explain;  he opines: Kemelman lets you know just what he thinks of ultra-orthodoxy,  the &quot;born again&quot; baal-tshuvah movement, and a few other hot  issues in modern judaism. American Jews especially are likely to enjoy the  &quot;home town&quot; feel of the Rabbi Small mysteries.<br />Non-Jews may  find it eye-opening to catch the glimpses of Jewish culture, religion and  ethics. As a tiny example, Small reminds his wife not to appear interested  at an Israeli shop, because it would be wrong to raise the shopkeeper's  hopes and then dash them. In addition, there are all the other issues  mentioned above.<br />Kemelman's explanations are at least as important as his  plot, and there is a fair bit of it. You may find that a touch  heavy-handed, but I think that Kemelman pulls it off pretty well. The book  is really a gripping whodunit.<br />Even better, it's the rare sort of  whodunit with a complicated enough plot to keep your attention. Turning to  the end won't help you; the mystery is solved, but there remain a few  unanswered questions &quot;for reasons of national security&quot;. I think  that adds a satisfying realism.	2000-08-24
US	52767171	RZ3JMP2N1JKJC	0195024028	259965985	The Timeless Way of Building	Books	5	323	338	N	N	Changes how you look at everything	``The Timeless Way of Building'' explains the idea of patterns in architecture. A pattern is a way to solve a specific problem, by bringing two conflicting forces into balance.<br />Here's a very simple example of a  pattern. When a room has a window with a view, the window becomes a focal  point: people are attracted to the window and want to look through it. The  furniture in the room creates a second focal point: everyone is attracted  toward whatever point the furniture aims them at (usually the center of the  room or a TV). This makes people feel uncomfortable. They want to look out  the window, and toward the other focus at the same time. If you rearrange  the furniture, so that its focal point becomes the window, then everyone  will suddenly notice that the room is much more ``comfortable''.<br />I  applied that pattern to my own living room, by moving the TV under the  window and rearranging the furniture, and I was amazed what a difference it  made! That's a very simple example, and there are literally hundreds more  in this book and its sequel. Simply reading them is fascinating; it will  convince you that you can make your own home into something as wonderful in  its own way as the Taj Mahal--which is Alexander's whole point.<br />In fact,  the book's main idea is much more powerful than that. It applies to almost  every aspect of life, not just to architecture. When a situation makes us  unhappy, it is usually because we have two conflicting goals, and we aren't  balancing them properly. Alexander's idea is to identify those  ``conflicting forces'', and then find a solution which brings them into  harmony. It's a simple concept, but once you appreciate it you realize how  deep it really is.<br />This is definitely one of the best books on my shelf.  It has really changed the way I look at...everything.	2000-08-05
US	52767171	RZ1VZL85EGKF8	0870687433	271355764	How the Hebrew Language Grew	Books	5	68	69	N	N	Fascinating, yet an Easy Read	``How the Hebrew Language Grew'' is absolutely fascinating. It will teach you a lot about Hebrew--but also about how linguists think, especially semitic linguists. Horowitz explains the major ways that new words are  invented, with lots of examples from Hebrew down through the ages.<br />Yet  Horowitz is never dull or scholarly. He never gets bogged down in details,  and explains everything in clear, simple language. Linguistics can be a  dull subject, but Horowitz makes it come alive.<br />Maybe that's because  linguistics isn't really what Horowitz cares about. He is really a Hebrew  teacher, and he wants you to actually learn some Hebrew as you go along. By  telling you how different words were invented, he helps you remember them.  Even better, he helps you figure out new words that came about in the same  way. If you're interested in learning Hebrew, then ``How the Hebrew  Language Grew'' will be a real vocabulary builder!<br />I do have two warnings  for you, although I loved the book. First, Horowitz assumes that you  understand some very basic Hebrew. I didn't, when I read it, and still  thoroughly enjoyed it. But you will get more out of the book if you at  least know the alphabet, and can read it phonetically. If you can  understand simple sentences, that's even better.<br />Second, if you are  trying to learn Hebrew then this book will make you work a little. You CAN  just read it through--it is fascinating--but to make it stick, you'll need  to chew on it pretty carefully. Each chapter does have some questions at  the end to help you study. I ignored them the first time through, many  years ago, but now I'm using it almost like a textbook.<br />You'll definitely  keep coming back! This is NOT a ``read once, throw away'' kind of book!	2000-07-14

Book four of the Harry Potter series is every bit as good as the first three! Each is a wonderful mystery with surprising twists and hysterical turns. The series really does build as you go along, so you should read  them in order or you'll spoil the surprise. Rowling is a great writer. Her  books make enjoyable reading for adults, too. That's rare: not many kids  books please adults (the Hobbit and Watership Down are the two I'm thinking  of).<br />The series is a little bit dark, though--it reminds me of Roald Dahl  (James and the Giant Peach, etc.). Book one was great for all ages, but  they get spookier as you go along. Book four might be a bit too much for  very young kids. (Then again, if you let them read Goosebumps, these books  are pretty tame.)	2000-07-12

He discusses many ways in which archaeology support the Bible record--both by direct evidence, and by proving that the Bible accurately reflects the time in which it was  written. The book will definitely give you a new appreciation for the  accuracy of the Bible!<br />Sheler also does us a favor when he shows how  misguided the hardened critics are (on one hand), and mystical kooks (on  the other). For example, hardened critics believed there was no David, no  Sargon, and no Nebuchadnezzar--until archaeologists found evidence of all  three. On the other hand, mystical kooks continually dish up silliness like  the Dead Sea Scrolls conspiracy theories: suggesting that the scrolls are  being held secret because they would completely disprove the New Testament,  etc.. Other kooky ideas include ``Bible Code'' theories and the modern  gnostic ideas, which suggest that the ``real message'' of the Bible is in  the form of a secret message.<br />Sheler's book has its weaknesses, though.  He tries to be a little too glib. He dismisses the Bible a little lightly  at times, suggesting that ``only serious fundamentalists'' take this or  that portion of the Bible seriously. It makes him shoot low: he is content  to prove that the Bible is ``generally accurate'' while at the same time  leaving the impression that the Bible has often botched the  details.<br />Overall, the book is good and helpful. It leaves an off taste,  and some loose ends, for the reason I mention above. But if you can take it  with a pinch of salt, you'll be glad you gave it a read.	2000-05-11

Fisher discusses just about everything there is to know about steel. Not in super detail, of course--yet he manages to explain: the history of iron/steel making; how modern steel is  made; how chemistry affects the physical properties of steel; how an  American steel mill is set up.<br />Fisher's writing is easy and enjoyable.  The subject may sound dull: ``Steel''. Yet Fisher makes it extremely  interesting.<br />There's something in this book for everyone. Including fans  of that famous union-busting library-building steel baron, Andy Carnegie.  Pittsburghers should definitely read this. (BTW, if you're a Pittsburgher,  the Penn Hills library has a copy.)	2000-05-11

He covers a broad range of issues: reading a balance sheet; interpreting economic  indicators; evaluating debt. All worth knowing, and his mathematics is  decent (as long as you stay alert--there are some minor errors).<br />At the  same time, I found the book giving me an off taste. I'm interested in value  investing, which looks at stock as a piece of a business, and doesn't care  about fluctuating stock prices or predictions of the future. Klein  certainly discusses the value of businesses, but he gets into those other  things as well. For example, he suggests that predicted future earnings are  ``even better'' than past earnings for evaluating a company. Sure, if the  prophet Isaiah is making the prediction! Klein seems a little too market  focused for me, and it keeps me from enjoying his book as much as I should.	2000-05-11

I disagree on all counts! You really  should take a look at this book; it's an excellent all around  introduction.<br />1. Is the book too simple? No, it's supposed to be simple.  Lowe herself explains in the title, and in the preface, that this book is  meant to be ``Graham and Dodd made easy''. She did a good job; that's just  what the book is. After you read this book, you should think about moving  on to Graham and Dodd--but this book is a good start.<br />2. What's wrong  with quoting successful folks like Buffet, Graham and Lynch? Remember, this  book is ``Graham and Dodd made easy'', so it's bound to contain lots of  references to Graham and Dodd. Naturally, it also contains quotes from  Graham's most successful disciple, Warren Buffet. The quotes are well  chosen, so Lowe has done us a service. She has distilled the wisdom of the  master.<br />3. Should Lowe make recommendations, like ``use this formula;  don't use that one''? I don't think so. The problem with value investing is  that no one formula perfectly captures business worth. If there were a  simple formula, then everyone would be a millionaire. The fact is that you  need to know several different ways of looking at company value. Each way  is reasonable. Your personality, viewpoint and tolerance for uncertainty  decides how you weight these different variables. However you do it, you  will be exactly as successful as you are careful and businesslike.<br />So all  around, I think this book is an excellent introduction to value investing.  It captures the spirit of great investors, while remaining readable and  clear. Well worth your time.	2000-05-11

Goldfarb)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Everything You Need	DuCharme's book offers everything you need to do SGML authoring (which includes XML and HTML).

After reading this book you won't need to look  anywhere else to figure out how to apply his ideas and get started. You'll  be up and running.	2000-05-01

WarrenBuffet, the world's most successful investor, describes himself as ``85% Graham, 15% Fisher.''<br />Fisher explains the qualitative side to value investing, just as Graham explains the quantitative side. You really need both. If you follow Graham's advice insensitively, then you will find stocks which are selling cheap--because the company is truly in trouble. That's where Fisher comes in: you should examine low-priced companies from Fisher's perspective to find the ones which truly are bargains.<br />... Online discussions are no substitute for firsthand discussion with employees, competitors, etc. You simply can't meet enough people online; some companies' employees aren't even on the Internet. ... you will end up investing only in tech stocks--which I would consider extremely short-sighted.<br />On the other hand, online discussion is considerably better than nothing. Don't neglect the information you can find online!  This source of information will become increasingly important over time.	2000-05-01

That makes this book, on setting up a web site, stand out from the rest. Heard about the recent attacks that brought down commercial giants' web sites? That's why  the foundation of your approach should be sound engineering, with the bells  and whistles added later.<br />Okay, sorry for the sermon. The fact is that  this book discusses EVERY topic related to the world wide web. It gives a  broad understanding, plenty of detail, and a lot of wisdom as well. I  disagree with folks who suggest it is ``out of date''; it still provides  the perfect foundation for anybody who is going to build a web site (or  wants to know how they work).<br />If you want to use technology that isn't  mentioned in this book, go ahead and get another book on that. But those  are just details--this book is the bedrock and foundation. Don't hit the  infobahn without it.	2000-05-01

It has such far-reaching consequences. Cady's central theme is that documents, especially manuals, are no good unless they are  accurate.<br />Big whoop, you say? Well, think how often you buy something  with ``some assembly required'', and can't make heads or tails of the  instructions? How often have you tried to go somewhere (say, a wedding  reception), and found the directions useless? Too often, documentation is  prepared sloppily, as an afterthought. That shouldn't be.<br />Okay, but  what's so far-reaching about that? Well, here is an example. As a software  engineer, I write programs. (Good) programs contain comments, which explain  what's being done. In the spirit of Cady's advice, I started reading my  programs but focusing ON THE COMMENTS. Sometimes I would find mistakes in  the comments. Much more often, I would find program bugs staring me in the  face! The comments state plainly what I'm doing, and the code plainly  doesn't do it.<br />In other words, Cady made me think about things I do every  day which provide ``documentation'' to somebody else. A little checking of  the documentation can catch all sorts of errors--partly because checking  the documentation means that I READ the documentation at least once!<br />This  is an absolute must-read if you care about quality in anything that you do.	2000-05-01

Recently I bought a copy to save for my kids; it was such a favorite.<br />Bakeless's light, enjoyable style brings Colonial America to life as he recounts true stories about the  work of British and American spies on both sides of the American  revolution.<br />This is a wonderful read for children, and I found it every  bit as enjoyable to reread it as an adult.	2000-04-25

Talk of the ``new economy'' suggests that today's bull market invalidates any prior thinking. Bull!<br />Today's bull market is wonderful, but it's just like  every bull market before. Ups and downs will continue, and the intelligent  investor will use his head before risking his life's savings. You should  follow the principles in Graham's book absolutely--only the specific  numbers have changed.<br />In fact the fourth edition of this book explains  how Graham's thinking responds to changing market conditions. Absorb it!  You'll understand what has really changed, and what can never change. Then  you'll invest intelligently.	2000-04-24

She promises ``untold secrets'' about Warren Buffett's investment strategies, but dishes up well known facts, worn out platitudes, and errors.  I found her chapters on valuing companies very intriguing at first. Then I  determined exactly what formula she was using (I have a Ph.D. in  mathematics).  That chapter is a great example of her errors. She based  her calculations on exactly two things. 1) She assumed that the value of  the company will grow at a rate equal to the Return on Equity (after  deducting dividend payouts). 2) She projected an increase in the  Price/Earnings ratio for the stock.  That isn't value investing! If it  weren't for #2, she would have worked very hard to conclude that your  investment will probably grow exactly as fast as the company has been  growing. Wow! Adding in #2, she takes into account the _possibility_ that  the stock price will be a larger multiple of earnings in the future. But  value investment is about _ignoring_ stock market motion, and looking  instead at the _value_ of the company.  Not a good book. Get Ben Graham's  ``The Intelligent Investor'' instead.	2000-04-24

Flesch also wrote \\"Why Johnny Can't Read\\". He writes passionately; he advocates good, solid education and plain, simple writing. This book not only explains readable writing--it IS readable writing. The original edition dates back nearly to World War II, but it was ahead of its time: his advice is every bit as good today as the day it was written.	1999-09-30
