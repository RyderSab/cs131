The book was instead a situational paranormal mystery.<br /><br />Jazz, the lead character, reminds me an awful lot of Anita Blake, without the zombie raising ability. She's strong, pithy, and loyal. She has dangerous enemies and strong friends.<br /><br />Supporting characters - like Lucia, Jazz's new detective partner, Ben, her jailed former partner, Manny, Pansy... are quirky but believable and likable. The love interest isn't as well formed as he should be for a romance - and the relationship takes second place to the paranormal sitch.<br /><br />The thing that disappointed me most, though, was the cliffhanger ending. I hate nothing more than a book which insists I buy a bunch of other books.<br /><br />This one, though, was a good read.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-08-29

It certainly was a page turner.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of Beck - a pediatrician whose beloved wife was murdered eight years before. Or was she? Recent events have led him - and the FBI, and the original people who paid for the killing -  to question the official story.<br /><br />It is also the story of love - friendship love, companionship love, parental love, and spousal love.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. There is a bit of worldview attributed to the doc that you can tell is that of the author (how he looks at his patients, and their parents, is often a topic in the book). The casual back-story of his sister and her partner, and their trials as a couple, are told almost off-hand, and aren't of huge impact to the plot, but are, nonetheless, necessary to the story. They give you a fuller picture of the supporting cast than you usually get in the summer suspense.	2005-08-26

This woman writes so many stories, I wonder how she has the time to eat.<br /><br />That being said, I love her stuff. Most of it is just fluff, but the characters have a strength you never used to find in romance. She's truly set a new standard for the genre, and we readers are the better for it.<br /><br />This trilogy is my favorite of her longer works. This book, in particular, is stunning.<br /><br />Jude Frances Murray is a very scared woman. She's scared of life. But something shakes her world, and she forces herself to go for the brass ring. Ireland is, of course, the setting, and the mystical land is brought to life under Ms. Roberts hand.<br /><br />There's magic, and faeries, and romance, and a knowledge of self gained. In all, a wonderful trip.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-08-07

Because it's better than average.<br /><br />This is one of the early works of Ms Roberts. I'd never heard of it before coming across it as a \\"favorite reprint\\" in the bookstore.<br /><br />For the genre and the time, this is a great book. Eden is a down-on-her-luck Betty Neels type heroine. Her own practicality pulls her out of the tailspin her life is in. Add some lively teenagers and a bouncy best friend, and you have a classic.<br /><br />Unlike many of the books of the time, no character in the book is forever lighting cigarettes. No anachronistic technology is stressed (I find a lot of books from the 80's are, running-man-like, obsessed with how advanced the 80's were...). Just a good old-fashioned romance.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-08-07

If the romance had been left out, it would have actually been good.

Grimm wrote 'em one way (usually, grim!), Disney disnified them, then today's authors reality them up again.<br /><br />This is a twist on cinderella. The story itself is the story of the rat who was turned into a page-boy for the would-be princess. He's a boy now, but, he was a rat.<br /><br />It's also the story of society. From civil service units that are anytyhing but civil to tabloid journalism at its yellowist, we see the nasty side of society as it turns this innocent yet rat-like child into a \\"monster\\".<br /><br />The language may be a bit confusing for some young readers, but in all, I think it's a great fit for the age group. There's lots of tension, but no real threat. And, there's a fairy tale ending.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-08-01

They are so foreign to me, and yet so familiar. Part of that is the author's talent for letting you know the character. Another part is the universal nature of life - our problems are different only in the details.<br /><br />I am, in many ways, glad that I had more choice in my life than the girls of this culture. But the relationship between them is the salvation that brings the sory to the fullness that it has. In the end, the story wasn't about each of the women, yet it was about the joining relationship they have.<br /><br />My only problem with it was that it didn't close out well. It's like there's a sequel waiting - or, rather, life waiting. And I don't get to view the rest.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-07-31

As I don't like historicals (tend to romanticize the past too much for me) but I like paranormals (because I'm abby normal, myself), I decided to give it a whirl.<br /><br />There's a decided bow to the style of Jane Austen here. The rich women are, almost to an end, heinous. And our heroine, Mary, is the epitome of all things a woman should be: honest, smart, funny, good, and, departing from Austen, budding with sexual desire.<br /><br />The paranormal part - a ghost named Vincent who can possess others and hates the idea of any of his family marrying happily since he, himself, did not - is kinda frustrating for me. The ghost isn't evil, he isn't smart. He's not like the Canterville ghost, silly and pitiable. He's helpful in some ways, but mostly just frustrating.<br /><br />But this historical held my interest to the end - a rare feat - and I enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-07-31

After emphasising through the whole book that no couples last in hollywierd, the reader, at least I, seriously doubt that.<br /><br />Reading this book was like being in a time machine.

Taryn has just an awful day - awful! - and decides to indulge in brain candy in the form of a fabio romance. Much to her surprise, the hero of the story she's reading ends up coming to life, off the pages. The ensuing story encapsulates quite a strange idea, but almost pulls it off to believable.<br /><br />\\"Shattered Dreams\\" by Rebecca York was, to me, not interesting enough to finish. I tried, honest I did. But the plot and the characters didn't hold me. Miranda, the heroine, is the target of assassins, and our hero the artist is her one hope. There's back story and plot and maybe... just too much to try to put into a short story.<br /><br />The final story, \\"Road of Adventure\\" was the neatest premise to me. Jake and Shauna start out dead. That's right, dead. They're being given a chance to fix their lives. Their spirit guide, a mangy cat, is the only thing in the story that kinda annoyed me.

That's a rarity these days, for this kind of compendium.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of werewolf books, so the Krinard, though lushly evokative of the Louisiana bayou, didn't intrigue me as much as the other two stories.<br /><br />The Vaughn story was a little too silly for my taste. A portal to hell, and only the bad boy can save you from it? And a gorgeous landlord? Heavens, that IS fantasy. The story itself is very light, but quite fun.<br /><br />The tale worth reading the book for, though is the Lee. Her writing brings the magic eerily alive. The heroine comes to life, and her situation and choices draw the reader in. The romance is also very differently written than most romance, and is a real breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The other two stories, though, are just average.

Books 1-4 all had a very containable plot - a mystery to be solved, a villain to be foiled. Book 5 had a little less of that, though the whole Occlumency and Prophecy thing did give a plot to be summarized.<br /><br />HBP has none of that.<br /><br />Also missing from book 6 are all the little magic touches. No new beasts this year, a few new spells, but no new locales. This is really a plot vehicle, and that's ok.<br /><br />We get a lot of insight into the characters and how they're changing. The immature 15 year old Harry was often frustrating, the stunned-to-maturity 16 year old Harry is much more rational. You find yourself in his shoes - trying to make the choices he's making.<br /><br />And you remember, if you're an oldster like me, what it was like to have those raging teenage horomones. It's a tribute - not sure what kind - to Ms. Rowling that she can remember those teenage years and describe them so well.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD - but not huge ones.<br /><br />The only disappointment I had, truly, was that it's such a cliffanger.<br /><br />I find myself thinking of what a blogger said - books 1-5 were like star wars iv, while book 6 is more like empire strikes back... which, many will remember, is often thought of as the best of the Star Wars series. (in the HP series, PoA is still my fave, but I've only just read this one... that might change.)<br /><br />(*)>	2005-07-18

This is a grouping of stories, many of which are part of a larger series.<br /><br />The first, by the most recent Queen of Vampyr Fic, is a Laurell K Hamilton piece. It is from the Anita Blake world but a) is not lifted directly from one of her larger works and b) isn't full of embarrassing sex. Pretty good. Still, I think you need to know the Anita/JeanClaude back story to get this completely.<br /><br />The second, One Word Answer, is a Sookie story, and is also a winner. In this case, I think you probably can read the short alone, though you're better off if you've read the series. There are just these little in's - like Bubba - that you won't get completely without the other books.<br /><br />Biting in Plain Sight is a Betsy story - and MaryJanice Davidson has just totally made the Clueless Vampire the Coolest one. Here we have a glimpse into Betsy's court, and it's a pretty darn funny place. You also get to meet some other vamps of the realm... this story and the Harris make it worth the purchase price, if you're a reader of these two series.<br /><br />Galahad may or may not be part of a further universe. I believe it is, but it explained enough for me to be able to read it and enjoy it. I liked it enough to go pick up another Angela Knight book.<br /><br />Finally, Blood Lust, by Vickie Taylor, is a full story unto itself. It's a good short story, and worth the read.<br /><br />Another fun summer book, especially if you like flighty stories about vampires.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-07-18

This is the kind of ride that, six months from now, I will have forgotten that I read. But that's ok. It won't take me long to catch up for the next installment.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-03-13
US	52421557	R27DR4UJ0AXSW3	0778320847	914698889	Missing	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A timely subject	When you have romantic suspense titled \\"Missing\\", you're bound to think missing child, or maybe missing woman. Surprise.<br /><br />This is the story of a missing MAN. Colonel Wes Holden is a soldier who's seen too much, been through too much, and he decides he doesn't want to be himself anymore.<br /><br />The heroine of the story is a plain, good woman in the hills of West Virginia. She lives with her family. She finds Wes one day, as he approaches her, asking for water. She recognizes something in him, and reaches out to catch him.<br /><br />There is a strong story line to this book which has very little to do with the main characters. I find that kind of refreshing, and more than believable, since Wes has more than enough on his plate than to have to be the center of the other plot, also. The \\"bad guy\\" in the book is also well drawn and more than believable.<br /><br />There is also an element to faith in this book, as there often is in Ms. Sala's books. If you're allergic to the idea of God, perhaps you'll find this annoying. I find it surprising, since so few romances outside \\"inspirational\\" ones dare tread in this direction. But it's not so overwhelming (as another reviewer has suggested) that you've got God jumping out at every other plot device. Rather, it's a realistic portrayal of rural Eastern church-going folk. I find it kind of refreshing that this part of the character is actually addressed.<br /><br />All in all, a good read.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-03-13

I don't believe that you need to have read any of the above mentioned series to understand these stories.<br /><br />There is only one Sci Fi story in the bunch - all the rest are fantasy mysteries. Lots of murder, lots of dun-da-dun-dun logic, solving the mysteries. In fact, though I'm not a serious fan of the mystery genre, I found most of the stories in this book to be quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, since it's easy to put down - there are 12 separate stories under 220 or so pages - I recommend this book for those who love to read fantasy but don't have time for the epics these days.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-03-07

Usually, books of this nature in this format don't quite make the grade for me. Silhouette doesn't give the writers enough pages to flesh out the story, and the romance seems to bud, unnaturally, almost instantly.<br /><br />This story, however, begins mid-plot. The female vamp heroine and male human cop have known one another for a while and have an unadmitted attraction for each other.<br /><br />So much back story is told in this book that one can almost lose track of the plot. But it's all necessary, and all written pretty well.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It was a quick but good read, and though not a completely new take on angsty vampirism, it was different enough to carve out its own niche.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-03-07

Steve is one of those hard to find men: rich, clever, beautiful, and ready to commit.<br /><br />Okay, so it's fantasy, I'm up with that.<br /><br />The supporting characters in this book are written quite well, though I find it hard to believe that a 14 year old boy would be so precocious.<br /><br />The plot was really nothing more than a vehicle to get to know the secondary characters.<br /><br />It was a fun ride, not much more than fluff, but fun. I would just like to know, does the author want all of her characters to die of heart attacks within the next 10 years? They ate nothing but junk in all its junky detail through the whole book.

Her confusion at different situations is so well written. She feels frustration with herself for certain actions, and learns from these actions. She is a wonderful example to any young girl who is unsure of herself.<br /><br />The book itself is a wonderful study of both cultures - you can smell the jasmine and the hyacinth, you can taste the mango pickles and the pumpkin pie. And Seema does a wonderful job bridging the two cultures, struggling at first, then flowing, like the floral garlands she makes at once point in the story.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this story to anyone with a young child who is moving or has moved, or has lost a friend who has moved. It's a great story, and misery likes similar company.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-03-05

The top layer is that of Jerry, the 14-year old girl who stopped speaking when her mother abandoned her. The secondary layer is that of historical Spanish Jews and the persecution they went through - indeed that followed them wherever they went.<br /><br />It's strange to have two such powerful kind of topics - child abandonment and religious persecution - go together so well.<br /><br />But through finding the history of her ancestors - the mystical way this comes about seems natural when one reads the story - Jerry finds herself and her voice. And though not all is well - historical wrongs can never be righted - the knowledge of the truth gives a sense of completion to both plots.<br /><br />The character of Jerry is very well drawn - from her unwilling desire to be fashionable and accepted to her uncanny critique of Shakespeare. Her aunt - the other main character in the story, is a bit more than a supporting role, as she is as changed by Jerry as  Jerry is by her.<br /><br />All in all, a very good book.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-02-27

Crichton's new religion is demonization of pseudo-science. I happen to be a proponent of this religion, so I'm fine with it. I also think that those who are total greens will hate this book, because it shows their own \\"science\\" is really its own religion.<br /><br />That being said, the plot goes along quite well. I'm sure, when it is made, the challenge of filming in locations that mimic Antarctica, Iceland, Laos, and the American Western Desert will present quite a challenge. But, like most of M.C.'s stuff, this definitely lends itself to film. I just wonder how Hollywood will change the critique of itself...<br /><br />(*)>	2005-02-24

She's a fitness-bunny, naturally blonde, and she coordinates her flip-flops with her underpants (which, DUH, coordinate with her outfit.).<br /><br />But she's just fantastic. Sometimes, the metaphors or statements she made (Yeah, and Napoleon's stint into Russia was a day trip) stretched at the edges. But overall, she's a great character.<br /><br />The plot is pretty good, but is definitely second string to the romance. The supporting cast are well drawn, and the denouement (I've always wanted to use that word, even if I can't spell it) didn't let me down.<br /><br />All in all, a great beach read.

Yet, as I got to know the character, the position she was in was more and more understandable. She's a pretty strong chick.<br /><br />There are great gothic qualities to this story, but the only romance, really, is between other characters in the book. The story is so rich, and the characters are fantastic.<br /><br />One thing that let me down was the ending. I really didn't understand it at all. But it didn't really matter.

The first (Kenyon) is part of a series - and I've read the series, so I could follow it, but I've no idea how anyone who hasn't read the series could follow it. Indeed, it's not worth the effort.<br /><br />The second story (Ashley) was the best of the four, but was not much more than a weak romance. There was somewhat of an attempt at a mystical plot, but it was nothing new or interesting.<br /><br />The third story (Banks) was, for me, completely unreadable.<br /><br />The final story (Handeland), again, was nothing more than a thrown together romance, with a plot that was better than the others, but still wasn't fleshed out enough to be enjoyable. I get the feeling this was part of a series, but I'm not curious enough to find out.<br /><br />All in all, if you have a choice (I didn't), skip this.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-02-07

The plot and characters needed more time to be fully developed.<br /><br />The Lee story is wasted space. I had to brush my teeth after reading it; it was such tripe that it left a bad taste in my mouth. The story is completely implausible, even given my proclivity for alternative fiction. The characters are almost one-dimensional, though there is one twist that was unexpected. Mostly, it was a waste of my valuable reading time.<br /><br />That story pulled down the collection, for me.

Konigsburg is a fantastic writer. Her subjects usually pertain to children, and her characters are children, but the writing is not exclusive to kids. Her characters are real, in a way most juvenile literature misses. She's found a way to capture that moment between youth and adulthood so poignantly that you feel you know or even were the child in the book.<br /><br />Silent to the Bone was recommended to me by a friend with children just a bit older than mine. It handles a serious subject (child abuse) along with other, no less complex, subjects like sexual awareness and friendship, in a way that makes you want to go back and read it again and again. You want to figure out how it is she does what she does.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 12. Any younger would be at the discretion of the parent, as there are these complex subjects. But, even as an adult, it's well worth reading.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-01-23

Each is a venture into fairie-land, as those lessons used to be told: dark, no happy ending guaranteed.<br /><br />Though the stories are not at all related, there is a common theme: learn to look beyond what you see. There is always something more, and often something richer, behind the appearance.<br /><br />The first story is a deus-ex-machina kind of tale, the second a true hero tale. The third is a story about angels, yes, but casts them more as a hybrid somewhere between humans and G-d. The final tale is the darkest, the truth behind an ages-old tragedy.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good work of fantasy.<br /><br />(*)>	2005-01-16

Hamilton are two of the biggies. They have made angsty-vampire-romance a genre that sells.<br /><br />Never mind that I can't stand their more recent forays into fiction.<br /><br />Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series is picking up where Guilty Pleasures promised to go many years ago. There is graphic sex (warning if you're letting kids read this!), but it doesn't overwhelm the book. Instead, the plot and the characters overwhelm the book. As it should be.<br /><br />Although this is the first book in the series to be published in hard back, I don't really think it's a standalone. It's hard for me to believe that someone who doesn't know Sookie's back story could enjoy this book thoroughly and without confusion. But it's a great read, especially if you've read the previous books in the series.<br /><br />If you're thinking of starting this series, start at the beginning. It's worth it.	2004-12-08

This second young-adult pirate novel I've recently read (Bloody Jack being the first) is another wonderful foray into the action-adventure realm for girls.<br /><br />The book attempts in its own way to address all the social wrongs of the late 18th century - slavery, lack of female equality, classism, etc. etc. It's also full of \\"the moral of the story\\" kind of stuff, with evil never quite prospering, even in its many subplot attempts. The book mostly avoids a preachy tone, though, and brings a wonderful adventure that has just a slight supernatural background (much credence is put in dreams, here.)<br /><br />The characters in this book are strong, though they are in rather unbelievable positions. There is a beautiful friendship between two young girls, told from the point of view of one of them. There is love, death, greed, fear, exhiliration - everything but a sea monster - to keep the reader reeling through the story.<br /><br />All in all, a very fun read.	2004-12-08

Be the master of your own destiny, the Captain of your own fate. Look to your heart for truth. Climb every mountain, ford every stream...<br /><br />And at the same time, the treasure you seek most may be easier to find than you could ever imagine.<br /><br />I fully expected one last cliche - that the treasure would be all the knowledge and experience and love that the boy experienced through his journey. His own life and heart would be his treasure. In this, I was (happily) wrong.<br /><br />But I loved this little book. It was told in such a lyrical way, and it made the unbelievable completely plausible. Magic, mysticism, beauty, love: all in this little book, all portrayed so prettily.<br /><br />I recommend this book because it's a quick, fun read that leaves you feeling better for having read it.	2004-11-28

Constantly divided between two cultures, they struggle to be true to both. Sometimes, April, a budding geologist who lives with her manipulative grandmother, wants to be true to her Chinese heritage. Sometimes, she just wants to study for exams.<br /><br />The real flavor for her circumstance shows when her own prejudices are revealed - when she looks at an issue through American eyes that her grandmother sees only through Chinese ones; when she looks at another issue through Chinese eyes, when her boyfriend only sees the American side.<br /><br />The characters and situations in this book are very well drawn.

Teenagers in general are very isolationist, yet at the same time very aware of any inconveniences in their own lives. This book shows how those very traits are used against students to take over their lives.<br /><br />But the premise is not fully thought out.
