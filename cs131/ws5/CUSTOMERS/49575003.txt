Velikovsky was a Russian psychiatrist, and had no training in biology, chemistry, physics, geology, or astronomy. Nor history, anthropology, cosmology, folklore, etc etc. <br />Here are some of his obvious mistakes:<br />-He frequently says that Aphrodite was the Greek goddess of the moon and that Athena was the Greek goddess of Venus. Neither of these is true. Athena ddn't have a planet equal, and Aphrodite's planet was Venus.<br />-Says there was a period in time about 4,000 years ago when there was no oxygen on Earth. This would be impossible. <br />-Uses the terms carbohydrate and hydrocarbon interchangeably. Does the man not know the difference between sugar and petroleum? (at one point he claims the Jews of Exodus ate hyrdrocarbon...that's just comical)<br />-Says the length of Earth's orbit was different about 4,000 years ago, but coral beds, tree rings, Mayan calendars and Stonehendge all show a consistent length of day for the past tens of thousands of years. <br />-Claims Venus is a comet. Comets are basically big dity snowballs. They're ice cold. Venus is a giant rock that's molting hot. <br />-Claims water is explosive<br />-Ignorant to the theory that different people can perceive a singular event differntly, as pointed out by the famous psychologist Rorschach. Wouldn't a psychiatrist be familiar with this?<br />-Claims it rained hydrogen about 4,000 years ago. It would have to be very cold to rain hydrogen...<br />-Claims flies are of an alien nature. We know they aren't because we have analyzed their DNA. <br />-contradicts himself many times, one obvious time being that ancient people couldn't accurately estimate time on page 59, but later of page 323 said they were good...hmmm...<br />-claims that mountain were formed by a strange gravity phenomana that occured when Venus allegedly swung by Earth's orbit. Apparently Velikovsky wasn't familiar with plate tectonics.<br />Those are just a handful of some of Velikovsky's wild scientific errors, as the book is riddled with them. Velikovsky is dead, his books are out of print, and as we learn more about earth sciences and physics it becomes more clear that most of Velikovsky's claims were way off target.<br />The book is quite fanciful and mildly entertaining, showing some interesting ideas for mythological explanation, but in the end it fails in all attempts. Best left alone.	2001-10-21
US	49575003	ROFUIBSOP4TJ1	0882700960	349199709	The Satan Seller	Books	1	28	46	N	N	Of all the literary hoaxes	This one still has to be the one most believed in, after being debunked (more on that a bit later). Certainly most famous and dangerous of all literary hoaxes was &quot;The Learned Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, which caused the Holocaust. That book (which is so greatly sold here at Amazon...) is an offense to humanity. Then in the '60s a book came out called &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot;. It later turned out the author was a George Wallace supporter and KKK member. So much for that books magic. Then in 1980 we got &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, a fictional story portrayed as truth about a girl tortured by &quot;Satanic cults&quot;. <br />Then there's The Satan-Seller. A story about a young college student who finds himself in a Satanic cult (despite the fact the author doesn't know a group of Satanists is a &quot;grotto&quot;) and is then converted to Christianity. The author goes on to describe fictional practices, and literally libels an entire religious belief that is recognized by the US. <br />However, in 1992, Cornerstone Publications (an Evangelical Christian group), debunked the whole story of The Satan-Seller in their still in print &quot;Selling Satan: The tragic story of Mike Warnke.&quot;<br />The author of the Satan-Seller knew nothing about real life Satanism. Real Satanism, or more commonly &quot;LaVeyan Satanism&quot;, was founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey (who played the devil in Rosemary's Baby). Satanists believe in self worship (though not to solipsism), and honoring your own desires (as long as they're sensible). They don't believe in any deity, and especially not Satan. LaVey derived the name Satan as an archetype for his sect, pointing out the fact that in Genises the devil actually wanted Man to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, whereas God wanted to keep Man stupid...<br />Anyway, this book wrongfully slanders an entire established belief system in the name of Christianity. It's people like Mike Warnke that give a badname to Christianity.	2001-08-21
US	49575003	RNFFBWHVWOTF6	0380751925	313724542	The Necronomicon	Books	1	13	23	N	N	Interesting	First off, there's no question about it, there is no Necronomicon, as it was an invention of Lovecraft. In a 1936 letter he says: &quot;I am forced to say that most of them are purely imaginary [books referenced to in his stories]. There never was any Abdul Alhazred or Necronomicon, for I invented these names myself.&quot; <br />Any Greek scholar knows that &quot;Necronomicon&quot; is incorrect grammar, and any Arabic scholar knows that &quot;Abdul Alhazred&quot; is redundant. <br />On the theory that Lovecraft lied about his claiming the Necronomicon a work of fiction, there is little evidence to support the it. Says Joshi, the foremost Lovecraft scholar, Lovecraft was always truthful, and was a materialist (as in the philosophy, i.e. atheist,agnostic). He regarded the occult as primitive and superstitous, though the only concept that sparked Lovecraft's imagination was the fictional dealing of man with the cosmic unknown. <br />Now onto this Necronomicon as an occult book. It simply can't be. Why, you ask? Well, for one error, is that the author cites that one passage might refer to &quot;Lovecraft's R'yleh text&quot;. However, Lovecraft never wrote about any R'yleh text, that was August Derleth who wrote that. Also, the Sumerian mythology in this book contains mythology that didn't come along until long after the time periods referenced. So far, this is still the only Necronomicon that's author has not admitted to  being a joke or spoof.<br />However, most scholars, if not all, agree that this is nothing more than a badly planned, yet elaborate, literary hoax. Let HP Lovecraft and his works of fiction lay in rest, don't exploit the dececeased.	2001-08-20

However, one scientist they cited, Bakster, later admitted to *never haved repeated his experiments*, thus only doing one test. That's hardly scientific. One researched cited in this book claimed that plants sulked when he insulted them. To understand this, the plant must understand English. I think people are willing to believe anything. However, of the &quot;successful&quot; experiments listed here, other scientists haven't been able to replicate these findings (which some blame on &quot;hostile scientists and plants who don't want to cooperate&quot;, which is just ad hoc logic).	2001-08-14

Books	2	17	24	N	N	Disappointed	This book is not recommended. There are too many flaws to mention, as in the fact that the author actualy states some myths to be true (more on that later). Here are some flaws:<br />1. No bibliography. His \\"debunkings\\" of myths are arrogant, yet he never cites a source. Scholarary no-no.<br />2. He claims that \\"Ring Around the Rosies\\" was a reference to the Black Plague and popped up in 1347. Where he gets this I have no idea. The first mentioning of Ring Around the Rosies appeared in 1881, a far stretch from 1347. Also, how could \\"ashes\\" been a corruption of a plague victim sneezing? The ashes part wasn't added until the 20th century. This was the first version of \\"Ring Around the Rosies\\": <br />Ring a ring a rosie,  A bottle full of posie,  All the girls in our town,  Ring for little Josie. <br />How that could relate to a plague is beyond me.<br />3. He claims the Baby Ruth bar is named after Grover Cleavland's daughter. There is no evidence for this claim and it has always been rather ambiguous.<br />4. Finally the author claims John Hanson was the first president of the US. Let's look at this. No one in Hanson's time called him the President, and John Hanson couldn't possibly have been the \\"first president of the United States,\\" because neither the office of President of the United States nor the nation known as the United States of America was created until after he was dead.<br />Main source: ...	2001-07-31

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	1	24	40	N	N	The Protocols of the Elders of Serbia	I'm am not sure as to the motivations of the author. He claims that the story of Serbs and Slavic gypsies being killed en masse by Nazis was a Serbian fabrication. He also puts stress on the alleged vileness and racist tendencies of the Serbian people. Mr. Cohen is a Holocaust denier to one point, to quote the United States Holocaust Center: \\"In Croatia, members of the local fascist Ustasha movement killed tens of thousands of Gypsies; along with Serbs and Jews...In Serbia, in the fall of 1941, German army firing squads killed almost the entire adult male Gypsy population, alongside most adult male Jews, in retaliation for German soldiers killed by Serbian resistance fighters.\\" So as I hope you can see, Mr. Cohen's beliefs are a fabrication.	2001-07-28

He questions not just the capacity for memory, but the capacity for culture and civilization itself, in ancient peoples. Prehistoric humans did not develop their own arts and technologies, but rather were taught art and science by visitors from outer space.<br />Where is the proof for von Däniken's claims? Some of it was fraudulent. For example, he produced photographs of pottery that  he claimed had been found in an archaeological dig. The pottery depicts flying saucers and was said to have been dated from Biblical times. However, investigators from Nova (the fine public-television science program) found the potter who had made the allegedly ancient pots. They confronted von Däniken with evidence of his fraud. His reply was that his deception was justified because some people would only believe if they saw proof (&quot;The Case of the Ancient Astronauts,&quot; first aired 3/8/78, done in conjunction with BBC's Horizon and Peter Spry-Leverton)! <br />However, most of von Däniken's evidence is in the form of specious and fallacious arguments. His data consists mainly of archaeological sites and ancient myths. He begins with the ancient astronaut assumption and then forces all data to fit the idea. For example, in Nazca, Peru, he explains giant animal drawings in the desert as an ancient alien airport. The fact that the lines of the drawing would be useless as a runway for any real aircraft because of their narrowness is conveniently ignored by von Däniken. The likelihood that these drawings related to the natives' science or mythology is not considered. He also frequently reverts to false dilemma reasoning of the following type: &quot;Either this data is to be explained by assuming these primitive idiots did this themselves or we must accept the more plausible notion that they got help from extremely advanced peoples who musthave come from other planets where such technologies as anti-gravity devices had been invented.&quot; His devotion to this theory has not dwindled, despite contrary evidence, as is evidenced by still another book on the subject, Arrival of the Gods : Revealing the Alien Landing Sites at Nazca (1998).<br />There have been many critics of von Däniken's notions, but Ronald Story stands out as the most thorough. Most critics of von Däniken's theory point out that prehistoric peoples were not the helpless, incompetent, forgetful savages he makes them out to be. (They must have at least been intelligent enough to understand the language and teachings of their celestial instructors--no small feat!) It is true that we still do not know how the ancients accomplished some of their more astounding physical and technological feats. We still wonder how the ancient Egyptians raised giant obelisks in the desert and how stone age men and women moved huge cut stones and placed them in position in dolmens and passage graves. We are amazed by the giant carved heads on Easter Island and wonder why they were done, who did them, and why they abandoned the place. We may someday have the answers to our questions, but they are most likely to come from scientific investigation not pseudoscientific speculation. For example, observing contemporary stone age peoples in Papua New Guinea, where huge stones are still found on top of tombs, has taught us how the ancients may have accomplished the same thing with little more than ropes of organic material, wooden levers and shovels, a little ingenuity and a good deal of human strength. <br />We have no reason to believe our ancient ancestors' memories were so much worse than our own that they could not remember these alien visitations well enough to preserve an accurate account of them. There is little evidence to support the notion that ancient myths and religious stories are the distorted and imperfect recollection of ancient astronauts recorded by ancient priests. The evidence to the contrary--that prehistoric or 'primitive' peoples were (and are) quite intelligent and resourceful--is overwhelming. <br />Of course, it is possible that visitors from outer space did land on earth a few thousand years ago and communicate with our ancestors. But it seems more likely that prehistoric peoples themselves were responsible for their own art, technology and culture. Why concoct such an explanation as von Däniken's? To do so may increase the mystery and romance of one's theory, but it also makes it less reasonable, especially when one's theory seems inconsistent with what we already know about the world. The ancient astronaut hypothesis is unnecessary. Occam's razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected.	2001-04-20
US	49575003	R8EFL66KHWA47	0061020710	181852028	The Color of Magic	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Great	Adventure. Fantasy. Humor. Those are the key words that come to mind when thinking of _The Color of Magic_ by Terry Pratchett. This book starts off with the meeting of Rincewind and Twoflower. Rincewind is a failed wizard who lives in the big city of Ankh-Morpork, he is scruffy, skinny, and pessimistic. Twoflower is a tourist, the Discworld's first and only. He has glasses, is rich,an insurance salesman, and incredibly naive. He also has a camera and magical luggage, which are extremely rare in this fantasy world. They meet up and through a series blunders they end up burning most of Ankh-Morpork down, but that happens a lot. Through their travels they ecounter such characters as Hrun the Barbarian and his talking sword. They find dragons, that only exist if you believe in them, they are held hostage in a mountain palace, they fight tree people, they fight ancient beasts in ancient temples, they go to the edge of the Disc (and fall off), encounter some seriously crackpot scientists, and more. All of this is seriously intriguing adventure, mixed with an equal amount of humor. Think Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but funnier and with  more action. This is the first book of about two dozen set in Discworld. Discworld is a Disc of land, hundreds of miles across, that rides on the backs of four giant elephants which stand atop a giant space turtle that's bigger than the Disc, Great A'tuin (sex unkown, that stumpls Disc philosophers everywhere). They also don't know where the Turtle is leading. The second book in the series is _The Light Fantastic_, which continues where TCOM left off. Here we are back with Rincewind and Twoflower and the Luggage, and back at hilarious adventures. The Light Fantastic is funnier than TCOM because you've already been introduced to the characters and to Discworld, so there's more focus on adventure and humor. These books are cheap and joyfully read, enjoy!	2001-03-14

This book is decent, and maybe a little better. This book is not bad at all really. If  you want easy escapism, some Braveheart remeniscent adventure, and some  cool characters, give this book a try. This is not a great work of  literature. This is not a book to be compared with David Copperfield.  However, it is not like I said earlier, a piece of trash. No, this book is  neither you see. This is just good old fantasy, and NO, Salvatore is not a  Tolkien rip off at all. Jordan is. That is why Salvatore is better than  Jordan.

First off, I would like to commend Jordan on the writing  method that he incorporates, he is a very skilled and deft writer, and I  love his style. However, the storyline, lacks. There are just too many  parallels to the master of Fantasy, Tolkien. I was also concurrently read  _The Fellowship of the Ring_ at the same time (by Tolkien rather  obviously). Here are just a few: In EotW, Rand, a farmer, is about to  celebrate a major festival, included with fireworks. In the LotR, Bilbo is  about to celebrate a festival, included with fireworks. In EotW, a  mysterious figure comes to the village at the same time. (Moiraine)In LotR,  a mysterious figure comes to the village at the same time (Gandalf). In  both books, the main character hails from a village area of naive idiots.  In both books, they have to fight a &quot;Dark One&quot; one way or  another. In EotW they have to find the &quot;eye of the world&quot;, in  LotR, they have to find &quot;Mount Doom&quot;. Also, in EotW, the  creatures they fight are silly and just plain odd. Trollocs, are creatures  with random animal parts mixed with random human parts. It's pathetic.Plus,  here's something that has never really been voiced: The seris is too DAMNED  LONG. By the time all 10 books are out, it would be equivelant to reading  _The Stand_ 8 times. It's just too long, flat out too long. Jordan also  tries too hard to make his world. Tolkien made MiddleEarth better then  Randland, in half as many pages.There are certain things I look for in a  good fantasy. There's Escapism, Adventure, and Plot (includes character  development). In this book, the Escapism is decent, at best. There is  little adventure/action, and when there is, it's repetetive. Now: character  development. This is a tough call. All the main characters are daft  bumbling idiots, and that's about it. Lan and Perrin, the interesting ones,  are hardly focused on. Maturity Level: Teen END	2000-08-17

It started off good, then tumbled. It starts out  full of suspense, as Hiro Protaganist is on a timed pizza delivery, then  his vehicle wrecks and a rebellious teenager named YT has to help him. Hiro  spends most of his time in the Metaverse, a virtual cyber world. Here he  comes across a virus called &quot;snow crash&quot; which threatens to  activate a &quot;bablyonian infocalpyse&quot;...this is where it gets  weird. Who wants to read aoout linguisitc theories based off of the  Sumerian culture and how it relates to the Net and the alleged  &quot;Infocaplypse&quot;? I mean really...Stephenson just tries to be too  damned unique. Also, the book has a poor and shabby excuse for character  development. There is only the most minute description for each character,  and even less for co-characters. The antagonists are weakly constructed,  and the world is not fully releazied. Now, I'm not into the  hacker/cyberculture subculture, but that doesn't mean there was still a  possibility to enjoy it. Of course as shown, it was a rather terrible read.  But foremost of this book, is the annoying fact that it was written in  PRESENT TENSE. It just gets all your nerves. An example: Hiro say,  &quot;How do you know that?&quot; YT replies, &quot;I've just heard it  before.&quot; Hiro then walks to the nearest door. It drives you completely  out of your mind.

For the  devoted sci-fi fan (who for some reason hasn't read this book...): This  book contains scenes which are inummerable and subjective to your thoughts,  images which are astounding considering the day in age written. Mechanical  hounds, massive bombers, wall size televisions, nuclear war, all of it is  contained here.<br />For the Owellian/Huxley dystopian fan: This book contains  issues of censorhip that these days are beginning to ring true. Poems are  regarded as sad thoughts that make people angry. Your spirit will be lifted  as the protaganist, Guy Montag, views a woman commit suicide after seeing  her books burn. You get to  feel for the characters and their actions, and  you will love the ending.<br />For the cheap sci-fi fan who just wants wanton  acion and adventure: Sorry pal, don't look to this book for action.

I just could not stand &quot;The Hobbit&quot; at all, yet I wanted to venture into fantasy, so a  friend (who hasn't read this) referred me to the novel itself. He had  mentioned that &quot;Homeland&quot; by Salvatore was better than decent.  But still, I was rather skeptical. All in all, this is a tremendously great  read.<br />Adventure Value: 9/10- This book contains numerous battle scenes  and heroic combat moments<br />Romance Rating: 3/10- Wulfgar the Barbarian  does do a little hitting on the female protagonist, but nothing  more.<br />Character Development: 7/10- Drizzt, Bruenor, Regis, and Wulfgar  are well developed, but there is some slacking on the antagonist: Akar  Kessell.<br />Climax: 8/10- The ending of the read draws to a beautiful  close.<br />Plotline: 6/10- The plotline was thin at random points, though at  times it was as thick as molasses...<br />Creature Feature: 8/10- there are  barbarians, goblins, orcs, ogres, giants, and even an ice dragon...it's  well done...<br />My overall commentation on this book is that it is very  good, and I recommend anyone new to the genre read it soon!	2000-07-06

Well, here's why:<br />Action Level: 7/10- There is a fair amount of adventure and peril strewn throughout the novel.<br />Romance Level: 8/10- There is a well  developed relationship between the characters.<br />Satirical Value: 9/10-  This book has hilarious satire value.<br />Plot Twist: 10/10- This was the  *best* twist possible in a novel.<br />Character Development: 7/10- The  characters underwent a major transformation that is highly  described.<br />Writing style: 8/10- Chuck writes with a unique fluidity much  similar to Vonnegut that many will enjoy.<br />Overall, I advise *everyone* to  read this novel...	2000-07-06
US	49575003	R2MPQJYA8RVU85	0451188462	562576523	Desperation	Books	1	5	8	N	N	Comical, un-King, and overall desperatingly mind numbing...	This book was rather comical at parts...Whenever someone would yell &quot;Tak!&quot; it was rather funny...but it got old too soon. This book was not horror however, for it didn't incite even the most minute amount of  fear into you, unless you happen to be a ten year old. I could not even  finish this book, as it was not aimed at mature level readers. King  intwined a tres numb Judeo-Christian value into the novel which absolutely  degraded the level of the book. This book was not King's forte and should  best be left alone.	2000-06-19

The climax was nothing I expected it to be, but everything was fine until then...I guess if I were Christian I'd probably give the book 4 stars, but oh well.	2000-05-07

I mean, you hardly got to know the Gentleman Caller, and before you can realize it, he's dead. You never learn what Casanova did in that house in the prolouge,  which would have made a better story itself. The ending wasn't satisfying,  yet I stayed up till' 3 a.m. reading it. Well, I had to stay up all night  and that was the only novel I had on hand. Anyway, it's good if you're a  Patterson fan, but just decent otherwise.	2000-05-07

It's not too serious, but serious enough to drive the point home. This is a great starting book and a must for any King readers of any age.	2000-05-07
US	49575003	R3SL7Q9EUKQ0WG	0451167805	250944357	Firestarter	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Pretty good.	This book was an exceptional read except for the ending. It was as if King was forced to finish the book within time constraints, and writing shouldn't be that way. The book was rather thought provoking and armed with  an interesting concept. I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes  King and has the time of day.	2000-05-07

It implies Jungian archetypal psychology with a freethinking rational structure, concocting a nicce premium blend of a modern religion. It also clears up any negative  grounds with Satanism, and shows LaVey's extroadinary abilities with  writing. RIP Anton Szandor LaVey 1933-1997	2000-05-07
US	49575003	R2S0N1Y6SIHEEU	0345378490	694344232	Congo	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Mmm...I devoured this book!	This is one of my favorite novels, and Crichton is a delightful author. He confirms this with Congo, Spehere, Eaters of the Dead, and so far Timeline. Congo is about a team hired by a corporation to go out and find out what  tragedy fell upon a previous expedition. There's plenty of action to keep  you wanting more, and then enough to turn the page. The movie cut out the  scene about the crashed airplane, and threw in a love story which is  ashamed. Anyway, do yourself a favor and read this book!	2000-05-07

This book was astoundingly great, and the movie was astoundingly terrible, I felt ashamed that I had seen the video. Oh well, the book is great, and totally unique. It also has a very well done twist at the end of the novel,  and keeps you addicted to the book. One of the reviewers said, &quot;This  book should come with popcorn.&quot; Well, I certainly agree and would  drink to that any day!	2000-05-07

What do you get? Battlefield Earth! You can avidly pinpoint when Hubbard uses Scientology in his writing (i.e. the  &quot;Pychlos&quot;), and all you have to do is look at how he rabidly  dislikes modern psychology and psychiatrics. The characters have silly  names and are two dimensional. Really, don't waste your time.	2000-05-06

Yes, when you read both Beowulf and EotD you can see the vast similarites. Even the hall of Hurot stays the same basically. Anyway, this book was a great quick read for anyone interested in the Norsemen days of old.	2000-05-06
US	49575003	R236E4ZDJZW3FV	0451160525	511631376	The Gunslinger (Dark Tower)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Well...probably 4.5, but I rounded up	This book was both interesting and entertaining, two attributes that complement each other nicely. This novel is a dark fantasy/sci-fi, so don't think it's a horror novel at the start. It's also the first book of a  series of seven(four have been published), so don't think it's going to  have a complete ending. The action and romance scenes are both tasteful and  abundant. You learn Roland the Gunslinger gracefully, and all the other  characters too. I'm on the second of the series (The Drawing of the Three),  and I found it comical with the &quot;lobstrosity&quot; scene. Anways, read  this book and follow up on the series if you're midly interested in dark  fantasy or sci-fi by King.	2000-05-06
