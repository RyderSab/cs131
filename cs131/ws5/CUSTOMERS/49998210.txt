US	49998210	R2SVOJGAXR7AI3	0440550130	456940352	The Day I Became an Autodidact and the Advice, Adventures, and Acrimonies That Befell Me Thereafter	Books	3	100	107	N	N	Interesting but adolescent	Kendall Hailey was clearly a well-read, articulate, thoughtful teenager. Reading this book also highlights that she was, primarily, a teenager. She dismisses college out of hand--throughout history, and across the board. She flits from career goal to career goal, but all of them remain within the sphere of her parents' connections. She comes from privilege, and is in a particular position to do what she does--yet no awareness of her unusual financial status is evident.<br /><br />Most importantly, she utterly fails to note that the vast majority of the other autodidacts she lauds did not sit in their parents' houses reading books. Instead, they forged their own paths in the world. Gauguin may have been self-educated, but he also went to the South Pacific. Mark Twain worked on steamboats. Benjamin Franklin ran away from home and did everything. Kendall Hailey sat in her room, except when her parents took her to London and Hawaii, and read books.<br /><br />I'm not criticizing her intellect or her aspirations, but I think this book could be looked at more critically. People seem to fawn over it, but I think the age of the writer defines the book's weaknesses as well as its strengths. Kendall Hailey's self-motivation is worthwhile. Her narrowness of vision, based on her own lack of experience, is worth discussion as well.	2005-05-16
US	49998210	RBBD1QJB71SEL	0804111359	207158162	The Secret History	Books	3	11	18	N	N	Ultimately unbelievable	Simply put, no one in the 1980s and 1990s talked like that. The characters sounded like they might have been pretentious and dated in the 1950s. While the story of their downward spiral is interesting, the characters are themselves never truly engaging. <br /> <br />Additionally, for all the reviews that cite the effects of the actions upon the characters, the actions were not \\"unavoidable,\\" as so many have described them. The characters suffered for their decisions and choices. And while much has been said about the way the characters reflect on the outcome and how they have been affected, in truth there is little reflection to be found. Richard's whole life at college is based on falsehood, and there is no examination of that. There is much wealth handled by people not equipped to manage it, and there is no examination of that. And the appalling level of privilege assumed by these characters is, similarly, never examined. <br /> <br />They did something, they got away with it, and they still felt guilty. That's about it, as far as reflection goes. The book could have done a lot more, but it didn't.	2004-09-04
US	49998210	R2HHH8EE0GYBWR	0312335164	201960968	Digital Fortress: A Thriller	Books	1	5	7	N	N	Redundant	Dan Brown is not a good writer. He can build suspense, but his prose displays his knowledge of cliches more than any facility with language or character development. That said, I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and--up to a point--Angels and Demons.<br />Digital Fortress, however, was incredibly disappointing. The plot and the actions of the characters make no sense. And once again, Brown hammers home the message that organizations always mean well, but evil deeds belong to individuals. (The heroine's protestations are almost laughable, they're so naive.) This novel highlighted the fact that Brown writes with a formula, and not one that's very successful. Basically, if you've read one Dan Brown book, you've read them all. And I don't recommend reading this one.	2004-06-30

It inspired my brother and me to set out on our own neighborhood exploration when we moved to a new city--back in the day when a parent could let a six-year-old and a four-year-old roam suburban streets without worry.<br />Unfortunately, it must never have been widely read. I've never met anyone else who remembers it. That's a sad fate for such a good book.	2002-09-24

US	49998210	RPP8WA9870NBW	0425158632	506174805	Executive Orders (A Jack Ryan Novel)	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Too long and lacking in focus	As I read this book, I had the feeling that Clancy has fallen prey to his own legend. The book seemed to be two separate stories pressed into one volume--as though Clancy had the material for two distinct 500-page books, and then said to himself, &quot;But I'm Tom Clancy! I can't write a book this short!&quot; and shoehorned them into a single plotline. The effect is disjointed, and results in a book that doesn't quite hang together.<br />More troubling is the character of Jack Ryan. In this book, he expresses so much idealism and naivite as to sound unintelligent. It is absurd that a CIA analyst would be shocked at political machinations within the government. Indeed, I had the impression that Jack was a little surprised that his country _had_ a government. I can't imagine that Clancy meant to make his hero sound so ignorant, but that's the effect.<br />Between the rambling and the bumbling, I'm put off of future Jack Ryan novels. It's too bad, because most of them were great. But for my money, stick a fork in Clancy; he's done.	2002-04-12

It's hard to see why they're drawn together, and why we should care about them. The writing is still good, but this story didn't grab me the way Fool's Errand did. I'd try another of his, but I wish I'd checked Endangered Species out of the library instead of buying it.	2001-09-13

His work is fair and honest, making Ghost Soldiers both a page-turner and, ironically, difficult to read.<br />My only problem is the book's lack of an index. On that basis, I'd give it 4-1/2 stars if Amazon would provide that option.	2001-08-06

Neither the hero nor the heroine is at all interesting, and their decisions drag on and on and on. The tangential stories are no better, with little or no character development. Small must be writing to deadline, because her secondary characters are all repetitions of earlier characters.<br />Lately, it seems as if each of Bertrice Small's books has been worse than its predecessor. She hasn't had an interesting heroine since the books focusing on Jasmine (and the last of those was pretty weak). Maybe it's time to let the O'Malley descendents rest in peace.	2001-01-30

Does it contain too many characters? Definitely. This reads like Paretsky put it out in a hurry, and possibly without a strong editor. Neither of those situations is likely to result in a good manuscript, and the results are evident here. The book isn't bad--it just isn't as good as it can be, and as many of its series predecessors have been.	2001-01-20

If nothing else, it's worthwhile to be reminded that things you don't even think about may be really annoying--if not hurtful--to someone else. And it can't possibly hurt to try and be a little more aware of the feelings of others.<br />Nonetheless, I think this book provides a good jumping-off point for dicussions about race. Many people are remarkably ignorant about how thoroughly racism pervades American society (other societies, too, of course, but that's not what this book is about). Williams provides a number of examples that nearly everyone should recognize, whether or not you agree with her.	2000-12-28

It's evident from his writing that he has thought long and hard about these issues.<br />On a few occasions, I disagreed with his analysis. For example, the woman on the elevator could just as easily have been apprehensive because he was an unknown man, rather than specifically an unknown black man. Gender can be just as powerful an issue as race in today's society. Or perhaps he was simply projecting his own impression on to her, and she wasn't concerned at all.<br />Still, McCall brings important issues to light, and his combination of experience and research brings powerful support to many of his arguments.	2000-12-28

Unfortunately, her recent novels have taken a turn into what might be termed &quot;speculative history.&quot; In an introductory note, she points out that her story is &quot;how it might have happened.&quot; The problem is that her proposed turn of events doesn't really make sense, and isn't consistent with her characters.

The first part of the book left me cold; oddly passionless, it was a fairly dull description of traveling under somewhat unpleasant conditions. The  excerpts from his notebooks, however, were engaging and thought-provoking.  I found myself much more involved in the latter portion of the book.<br />It  occurs to me that Chatwin had written his notebook entries long before his  trip to Australia. Possibly the lackluster quality of the first half was  due to his illness; the &quot;flashback&quot; portion of the book was much  more dynamic and showed great vitality. Because of the notes, I'll work  backward and try some of Chatwin's earlier works. I doubt, however, that  I'll re-read the Australian portion of Songlines.	2000-06-29

He manages to combine  historical analysis and synthesis with very personal episodes, showing how  long-standing issues continue to bear relevancy and immediacy. I found this  book to be a thoughtful examination of how Africans and African Americans  have made attempts to work together across the Atlantic, even as each group  has labored under mistaken impressions of the other.<br />I would not limit  the readership of this book to African Americans, or students at  historically black colleges. I think it's possible for students (formal and  informal) of all ethnicities to learn from this book, both about  African/African American relations in specific and cultural issues in  general. _Kinship_ provides a new angle on U.S. and world history. Its  thoroughness and accessibility should make it a useful and welcome addition  to any number of course reading lists.	2000-06-24

Godden portrays the nuns as human and individual beneath the uniform guise of the habit.

I was thrilled, however, when Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail) identifies the &quot;Shoes&quot; books for a customer and adds that Ballet Shoes was her favorite. It was mine,  too--in fact, I was so enthralled with it that I really couldn't get into  the others.<br />I'm sure that if I re-read it now, I would find it both dated  and unrealistic. As a child, though, I enjoyed it thoroughly. It can't  possibly be for everyone, but I'd bet that young girls who love ballet (and  I was one) will still enjoy this book today.	2000-06-15

The relationship between the characters--particularly their sex life--seemed nothing but unpleasant. Toward the end, however, it became both funny and menacing, which I assume  was the author's intent all along. This mood should have emerged earlier,  however, to make some of the protagonist's decisions plausible. The degree  of their isolation was difficult to believe, as well. Couldn't she just  have gotten a job and made friends through it? That's what the rest of the  world does, after all.	2000-05-22

Unfortunately, Goodman does not show what I am sure is the richness of this culture and community. A great book  would have shown the reader how the surface routine and repetition of  ritual is, for many people, a method of expressing and acting on devotion.  Instead, Goodman maintains a distance from her characters that keeps the  reader from entering their world. I never felt like I knew these people; I  just observed them and was oddly privy to some of their thoughts. While  many of the characters seemed like nice people, most of them lacked depth.  Only Elizabeth and Andras really came to life at all--and the two daughters  (of what, seven?) seemed like tokens. I guess they were supposed to  represent how the modern world made it harder for communities like the  Kirschners to maintain their faith and traditions, but they were no more  than ciphers and therefore added nothing. Still, it was an easy and  pleasant read.	2000-05-18

The author shows us how he perceives himself, and it isn't always positive. I thought his assessment of his own work was spot-on, too--when  he focuses on family, his writing is compelling, but when the emphasis  shifts to him and his friends, the book wanders (as did my attention).  Overall, though, I really enjoyed reading this, and am selfishly grateful  that I haven't had to face the challenges he and Toph had.	2000-05-10

The characters were interesting, and the multiple points of view kept things moving. The latter portion, after they leave the mission, seemed choppy and heavily didactic. I can't help  but think that the author could have streamlined this portion of the book.  And Rachel could have done with a few less malapropisms. Sure, a limited  number fit with her character, but the device was definitely overused.  Overall, though, I thought this was a wonderful book, and I want to re-read  it.	2000-05-10

The killer's motivation was so tormented that it was implausible, and the post-script, which was clearly the opening for the book's sequels, was so great a coincidence as to be ludicrous. I'm definitely going to have  to take a break from Deaver.<br />Additionally, it was a mistake to have this  book read by a British performer.

Now, however, I'm glad that I just got The Devil's Teardrop from the library instead of splurging on a bookstore copy. There were too many twists, and they stopped being believable. And I'd like to hear from someone who has some background in psychology. Generally, does a sociopathic _know_ he's a sociopath?
