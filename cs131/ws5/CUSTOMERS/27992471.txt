Although my expectations of it were a bit different than what I found, I really enjoyed it immensely.  I have been reading quite a few memoirs recently and although I liked many of them and gave some of them great reviews, I thought Kaplan would be another caustic wit, another neurotic New Yorker.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Cynthia Kaplan definitely has a sense of humor. And, sometimes she incites some laughter while displaying her not so great side. But, also, she is warm and loving and caring. And, she is constantly trying to be and do better and grow and evolve.	2005-08-13

I had just finished Autobiography of a Face and wanted to read this one to get a fuller picture of Lucy Grealy.<br /><br />I do think Ann Patchett writes well, but I really found this much less interesting to read than Lucy Grealy's book.  I found their whole relationship strange. . . from the day Lucy jumps up to Ann and hugs her fiercely in Iowa (without really knowing eachother) to the very end.<br /><br />At one point, Patchett states that Lucy says something like \\"I provided you with a way of feeling good about yourself\\". . .actually, I'm misquoting--I don't remember the exact quote and don't want to look it up-- but the point is the same.  Patchett was shocked and upset. But, really, their friendship seemed so one-sided.  I know some people do really thrive on being needed, but healthy people thrive on being needed and loved as well as loving and needing.  Ann Patchett seemed to just love and need without caring that she wasn't loved and needed as much in return.  It was a very weird, one-sided type of relationship.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend reading it if you read Grealy's book and liked it, and if you want to know more about her life.	2005-08-12

A quick read, I finished it in a few hours.  She writes of details we mostly dismiss, but finds the funny quirky part of every mundane event.  The story that made me choke from coughing during my laughing fit was the one near the end about the candy apple.  And I laughed hysterically without choking when I read about her tights at the gynocologist.  And so many others. They were ALL funny.  I really recommend this.	2005-08-12

In Grealy's case, though, she left behind so many people who really had bad personal experiences with her, that there are a lot of people to dispute or criticize her, as well.<br /><br />That said, even if she was a selfish and spoiled woman, this book is STILL good. It is easy to see, with what she went through, why she became so needy.  At such a young age, her self-image was distorted.  I think anyone who went through that would be the same. I'm reminded, now, of Frances Kuffel's \\"Passing for Thin\\".  The criticism of that book was similar to this.  She grew up terribly obese, taunted and teased also.  And, she had to relearn things the rest of us take for granted when she grew up.  Grealy learned everything through such negative experiences, also.<br /><br />Lucy Grealy considered herself a poet first, then a memoirist.  Her memoir reads like poetry and the words she chooses to use serve her well.<br /><br />After reading this, I read Ann Patchett's \\"Truth and Beauty\\" to get a fuller picture of Grealy.  Ann's book talked about many things that Grealy's left out.  Some reviewers seemed to find this troublesome.  I don't think that is the point, however.  Grealy shared with us her thoughts and feelings, not Ann Patchett's.  Sometimes they were contradictory to Patchett's. Sometimes they were contradictory to her own thoughts at different times. This doesn't make them false; it makes her more real.	2005-08-12

Yeah, it was funny. But not like her first book.  Her first book kept me laughing throughout but this book was a bit of a let down.  She grows up, for instance, and that's a good thing. But in this book, her humor seems forced. It's not self-deprecating quirky observations anymore.  Instead, what is supposed to be funny most of the time are her actions or her own words that she spoke to someone, rather than her actions or silent thoughts.  Also, the manic drunken energy that was funny during her younger days is a bit overbearing now that she's writing as a nondrunken adult.  She seemed to write as if she was trying very hard to make things funny.  In Idiot Girls, I didn't get that impression-- her life seemed naturally funny.<br /><br />In all fairness there were a few essays and/or columns that I found very humorous. But there were also long drawn out stories about Disneyland (here she confronts Winnie the Pooh and Donald Duck for not wearing pants.  And then she talks about it for several more paragraphs.  This was the joke in the story.  Uh, this is funny?) and a couple more that were so long and drawn out that I wound up skipping them entirely.<br /><br />Not really recommended, but I'm still going to give her other books a try.	2005-08-12

I am thrilled that I did because it is an excellent book and so completely beautifully written (and translated).<br /><br />Carrere is a wonderful writer. His character, Nicolas, is so amazingly realistic.  His thoughts, the way his mind wanders from thought to idea, his lack of confidence, his lying without explanation.  All this makes Nicolas compelling and empathetic.<br /><br />Although a bit of a thriller, this story is also a coming-of-age story.  Nicolas is forced to grow up while attending a two-week ski-camp with his class.  He yearns for acceptance and love and to be \\"one of the boys\\".<br /><br />He IS accepted and he IS loved, and right before the end of the book, he IS indeed \\"one of the boys\\".

Sure, it's true I wasn't crazy about Magical Thinking, but Burroughs' sense of humor is so wonderful, I thought this book would be wonderful, too.<br /><br />This was a great little fluff book. It's a quick fun read. But, unlike the nonfiction Running with Scissors and Dry, both which stay with the reader long after the book is finished, Sellevision is just an average novel.  What makes it a bit better than the average novel is that it IS funny in lots of places-- it's laugh-out-loud funny in lots of places. It's not politically correct and it's a bit cynical. But, it's not insightful. It doesn't make you think about it for hours or days or months after you're finished.  Mostly it reminded me of some of the chick-lit stuff that I've read.<br /><br />In summary: I enjoyed it, yes, but I don't necessarily consider reading it to be a good use of my time.	2005-08-10

Jeannette Walls relates her story with clarity and beauty.  Although her childhood was fascinating and kept me interested through the entire book, what's truly astounding isn't so much that Jeannette and her family were poor, it's that she and her siblings overcame so many obstacles (really big obstacles that most of us don't even realize are still obstacles for people today) and learned-- by necessity-- to be so much more self-sufficient than many adults.  It's really stunning that she and two of her siblings were able to persevere and make better lives for themselves considering how difficult they had it growing up.<br /><br />Walls' story is truly inspiring and motivating.  It's also a perfect example of the American dream, right here, right now. Thoroughly recommended.	2005-08-08

In this honest and harrowing memoir, Judith Moore talks about her childhood and adulthood as a \\"fat girl\\".  It IS honest. It IS disturbing.  It IS well-written.<br /><br />Then, what was my problem with it? Maybe the problem I had is that there is no resolution within the author.  At the end of the book, she doesn't learn to accept herself.  She doesn't learn to love herself. She doesn't accept her obesity and she doesn't lose the weight, either.  She doesn't learn to love herself and still writes with self-loathing.  Does this make the book less worthwhile, then? No. Does this mean that only authors that come to self-acceptance at the end of their story be recommended? Not exactly.  She has a story to tell. You might want to read it.  But, it's definitely disturbing.<br /><br />I know Judith Moore has had a fairly successful life, but you wouldn't know it from reading this book.  Maybe that's one of the issues I have with this account.  She writes with a detachment and flat affect.  And, it's almost the same sentence over and over again.  Her detachment itself COULD be powerful but it lacks something.  There is no epiphany.  THere is no self-kindness. There is no PASSION for anything.  There is her story.  There is no passion for her husband or her children.  There are no lights in the darkness.  Her flat retelling of her childhood and adulthood make her seem as if she's also very very dull, whether or not that is really the case.<br /><br />I really recommend \\"Passing for Thin\\" by Frances Kuffel.  Frances Kuffel retells her similar childhood and eating compulsion while also telling what that did to her as an adult.  What struck me when reading that book is that she tells us how she lacks certain skills as an adult that most of us just gain during childhood and adolescence.  For instance, she never learned to flirt playfully because she was never treated as an attractive girl.  She had no idea how to act as an adult now that people treated her with respect when they didn't during her fatter days.  She had to relearn things the rest of us take for granted. She SHARED with us what it's REALLY like to be treated with the disdain many obese people suffer.  Although Frances' book was wonderful, it was these kind of specific details that really stayed with me and enabled me to feel empathy and compassion towards her.  Judith Moore, on the other hand, writes with absolutely ZERO humor and almost ZERO emotion.  I understand that this technique could have been very powerful and I also hesitate criticizing her for it, because it's so honest.<br /><br />So, I guess I am trying to say that yes, Judith Moore may be a very interesting person with a lot of depth.  I don't think that came across in this book, though.  And, because of that, I wouldn't recommend it.y didn't during her fatter days.  She had to relearn things the rest of us take for granted.

And, you may decide you are not too interested in reading this book and opt, instead, to purchase another book that links to this page.<br /><br />In most cases, that would be alright.

Her abusive mother STILL, to this day, is the guardian of two children in Montana who are STILL being carted off to doctors and hospitals on a regular basis.  Her mother is STILL perpetrating abuse.<br /><br />This book was written to not only help the author deal with her past but to save the two adolescent children that are suffering at the hands of a very sick and abusive woman.  These two kids are \\"slipping through the cracks\\" of the very system designed to help them.  Unfortunately, the fact that these kids are being denied their basic rights is not being made known.  They same abuse that has been inflicted on Julie and her brother is now being inflicted on these two children.<br /><br />That said, this is a wonderful book.  Julie tells her story with emotion and feeling.  SHe learns a lot on the way and we learn it with her.  Highly recommended.	2005-08-05

I did not put this book down and read it in several hours.  It's a wonderful example of modern literature and completely unique in the fact that we read the most unspeakable horror and swallow it up, wide-eyed and alarmed, all the while amazed that something so terrifying can be written so poetically.<br /><br />This is not a horror novel by any means!  This is an examination of a certain aspect of our culture and how we can all be indoctrinated to accept it.<br /><br />I don't want to re-outline the entire plot, since so many reviewers have already done so.  What makes this story so powerful is how understated it is.  We watch these children grow from childhood to adulthood, always knowing how their lives will unfold.  Cloned from their \\"models\\", they know that they will eventually be harvested for their vital organs.  This is their purpose, and it is never questioned.  Ever.  Sometimes certain events or things will cause the protagonists to stop and almost reconsider their destinies, but they fail to consider it fully and go on with their lives as they've been taught to. Notably, there is an abandoned boat towards the end of the book.  Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy make their way to the dock to peer at this ticket to freedom.  Kathy notes the cabin size and condition and it's clear they could take that boat somewhere and be free.  They don't.  They don't even discuss it. They just watch it sitting there.  Kathy and Tommy drive all over the English countryside-- it's clear they have their physical freedom.  They drive to clinics to visit other donors, to stores to shop, cafes to relax in, and hospitals for pre-donation testing.  There are no doors or bars holding these people in.  They are conditioned from day one to live their lives knowing they will one day donate and \\"complete\\".  Nobody they know has done otherwise. There are no rumors about anyone refusing their preordained destinies.<br /><br />Herein lies the books strength and its weakness.  Throughout the novel, I thought it seemed as if it was leading up to a more climactic event. And, it did and didn't.  The climax was a bit anticlimactic and the characters brought in to meet with the two heroes seemed flat (while empathetic) and lacking depth.  The horror this meeting could have evoked was felt more fully through the use of Tommy's hopeful art, through some of the thoughts Kathy had and immediately disregarded.  It seemed as if more could have and should have been done with that rather than this macabre meeting with the two former school administrators.<br /><br />Yet, at the same time, maybe this is the novel's strength.  Freedom is hinted at, yet not taken. There is no prison, yet they are prisoners of society and their own minds.  There is love, but maybe the passion is lacking because they know subconsciously there is no future.  And, Kathy has seen her friends complete. She knows what's coming after donation number 4 for the man she loves.  She changes the subject when he brings the subject up. She dismisses it because it's too difficult to openly discuss it. We know this and they know this.  And, although this might be the book's strength, I do yearn for this discussion. I'm left without real closure and I want them to wake up.<br /><br />This is heartily recommended.ained destinies.   <br /> <br />Herein lies the books strength and its weakness.

His writing is stark and simple, yet completely descriptive and powerful.  I really could not put this book down and recommend it completely.<br /><br />This was an absolute bonus.  I purchased this book (and his second, My Friend Leonard) after seeing Frey on John Stossel's Addiction program.  Frey stood by his belief that addicts make a choice to drink.  Yes, it's a compulsion, maybe, and there may very well be a physical component. However, he believes that he and only he is responsible for his addiction. Not a higher power.  And, I admire this about him and immediately ordered his book.<br /><br />Because he survives, it is easy to see much of what he goes through at the treatment center with a bit of dark  humor.  He, too, sees the lunacy in his situation and with the people he meets. Although he mentions a few of the less colorful characters, he really hangs around the hardcore addicts.  And, seeing what happens to all of these folks at the end is more than a little heartbreaking.<br /><br />I've been reading a lot of addiction memoirs recently, and this is one of the best.  If you're thinking of purchasing this, get his follow-up memoir, too, My Friend Leonard.	2005-08-02

Leonard is only funny if he's real. . . .and, now that it's obvious he's not real, this book isn't worth your time.  If it's fiction, the characters are just too unreal.  Leonard, for instance, is Joe Pesci as one of those crazed mobsters he plays.  Definitely don't waste your money and go to the library if you still want to read it.  James Frey is a liar and a fraud.  This book should be resent to fiction-- mediocre fiction.<br /><br />First review:<br /><br /> read this immediately after finishing A Million Little Pieces.  I can't say this book was quite as good as that one, but it's definitely close.<br /><br />The author meets Leonard in the treatment center and stays friends with him afterwards. As a matter of fact, both of them are extremely close and, to Leonard, James is the son he never had.  Although they aren't in the same proximity, they keep in touch and visit fairly frequently.  Leonard, however, is a criminal.  But, he's got a heart of gold when it comes to his friends, including James.  And, it's easy to excuse the criminality (that isn't truly explored) in this book because it's written so like a novel.  I pictured Leonard as Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, as a matter of fact, so maybe this is why his criminal history wasn't as important as his friendship to James was, to me.  Their friendship is the heart of this book and it's quite the friendship.  Although they've both been on the fringes of society, they have a true affinity towards eachother and, more than anyone else, they can count on eachother through thick and thin.<br /><br />Anyways, James gets his life together in this book.  I was glad for him, yes. But, if it weren't for Leonard, this would not have been an interesting second memoir.  Leonard made these pages come alive and while this book didn't quite have the \\"can't put it down\\" feeling like the last one did, the ending more than made up for it.  I won't be a spoiler, but the ending was truly unexpected and bittersweet.  I very much enjoyed this and look forward to reading more from this author.it.

It's very well-written, and I stopped more than once to admire a few descriptive sentences or paragraphs.  Unlike some of the other reveiwers, I do not believe she \\"denies\\" her \\"alcoholism\\" at all. Horribly abusing alcohol is not necessarily proof of alcoholism. One can be addicted physically and psychologically and still not be an \\"alcoholic\\". And, even when one is no longer physically addicted, but still may be psychologically addicted, it doesn't mean they are an \\"alcoholic\\".  It means they have a compulsion they need to learn how to control.  It doesn't necessarily always follow that everyone needs to admit powerlessness and be in endless recovery and has a disease.  Although the disease model is accepted by the AMA and other organizations, there is more evidence and proof that it is, in fact, not a disease, but a compulsion or choice that can be conquered. (Please see the work of Stanton Peele PhD, Albert Ellis PhD, James DeSena PhD, Jeffrey Schaler PhD, etc. for more info) In addition, Harvard University did a study that cited that 80% of all addicts quit on their own without the assistance of \\"recovery programs\\", so there is no reason to doubt her ability to quit drinking and/or even drink moderately in the future (as opposed to the 95% failure rate of AA).<br /><br />This said, I am not sure I'd really recommend this book, though I'd definitely recommend A Million Little Pieces (James Frey) or Dry (Augusten Burroughs).  And, I can't even tell you why this is! I found Zailckas almost tiresome by the end of the book.  I found the continuing mistakes she made absolutely annoying.  Yes, I finished the book, but by the time I was through with it, I was so happy I wouldn't have to read her anymore.<br /><br />Still, I found much of her story mostly interesting-- enough to keep reading.  I did empathize with her as she found herself in humiliating and dangerous situations after a night of drinking and, at times, blacking out.  And, although I stand by my earlier comments regarding abusing alcohol and being an \\"alcoholic\\", I wonder what the author believes would actually define an alcoholic, if not her behavior, since she does seem to accept the disease model of alcoholism and does seem to believe that some people do suffer with this disease-- just not her.<br /><br />I am a bit ambivalent about recommending this book. It's worth reading or skimming.  It's something I'd pick up from the library and only purchase for a high school- or college-age girl who you believe might have an interest in the subject.out.

This one was a bit of a disappointment.  Actually, I'm reluctant to criticize these stories, because what I really like about Augusten Burroughs is exactly what I didn't like in this particular book.  I like his caustic wit. I like his honesty. I like his neurosis.  I like that he sees the trees instead of the forest sometimes.  However, some of these stories are just really boring.  Some of them are funny.  Some of them are less funny but have some really hysterical parts.  Some of these are just like journal entries. . . and these are the stories I found to be a waste of time.<br /><br />For instance, when Augusten writes of Dennis, he writes with such love and affection that, had there been an actual story to tell, I would have really enjoyed reading that. But, at least two-- maybe three stories-- were just about the author's intense love and affection for this man.  That's okay and all, and I'm happy that the author has found happiness, yet it is a bit boring to read for the reader!<br /><br />Additionally, there was one story where Burroughs steps on a baby's hand and moves away without explaining to the mother why the baby is crying. The mother thinks the baby wants a toy and scolds her instead of comforting her.  Maybe this is funny to Burroughs-- who openly admits he's a bit of a cad and not too paternal-- but it's really cruel.  And, although it might be funny if seen on Seinfeld, it's definitely not endearing and definitely doesn't arouse any empathy for the author from the reader.  Neither does the cruel way he kills a mouse.  Although the comments he makes after talking to a plumber WERE hilarious.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book, but I do recommend Running with Scissors and Dry. I am awaiting my copy of Selevision, as well. I haven't given up on reading any other books he comes out with.	2005-08-01

I couldn't put it down and finished it within one or two sittings.  Augusten Burroughs is one of the funniest and most neurotic people I've had the pleasure of reading. He has such a quirkiness about him and he's so honest--even when it doesn't paint him so prettily.<br /><br />I read this book at the kitchen table with my husband reading whatever he was reading. Every so often I'd laugh hysterically.  My husband started ignoring my laughter so I had to interrupt him to tell him what was so funny.  I could barely read these paragraphs aloud-- getting the words out while laughing so hard is always so difficult.<br /><br />Anyways, this is really one of the best memoirs I've read.  I was sorry to see it end.  If you like this, also try James Frey's stuff. He's good, too. . . but very different.<br /><br />I wanted to add one more thing: a couple of reviewers mentioned that \\"if you're gay\\", this book would be helpful, or relevant, or whatever. I think this book is great for ANYONE. Yeah, Burroughs is gay. But, more importantly, he's an interesting human being.  You don't have to be gay to appreciate his writing or appreciate what he has to say.	2005-08-01

I have never been disappointed with a Harry Potter book and this one was no exception. This sixth book, actually, was the best one I've read, so far.<br /><br />This story begins much differently than the others. There are two separate scenes before we meet Harry again at the Dursley's.  Rowling sets the stage for a more somber, more serious story with less comic relief than in past novels.<br /><br />I'll skip the plotline.  It is a wonderful book, though.  And, by the end of the story, Harry is an adult-- if not by age, than by experience.  He realizes what he must do and gains a sense of maturity and determination he hasn't had in the past.<br /><br />I am definitely looking forward to book seven, the final chapter.	2005-07-18
US	27992471	RPHXTKT1T9YM3	0787946435	926332559	Diseasing of America: How We Allowed Recovery Zealots and the Treatment Industry to Convince Us We Are Out of Control	Books	5	25	31	N	Y	Truth Explored	I can't disagree with the other reviewers who gave this book positive reviews.  The truth is, not only do the 12 steppers have a monopoly on the addiction industry in America, they also believe that 96% of us are diseased ourselves.  They are quick with this label-- if we are affected by an addict in our lives, we are diseased.  If we come from what they insist are dysfunctional families, then we are diseased.  If we suffer from any addiction at all we are diseased.<br /><br />This, by the way, is despite the fact that there is absolutely no evidence at all to indicate any addictive behavior is evidence of a disease AND contrary to the fact that every study that has been done proves that addiction is NOT a disease, but a behavior that can be corrected.<br /><br />Even without the labeling of common neuroses \\"diseases\\", it is important to realize that the 12 step approach has the LEAST effective success rate!  THis isn't commonly mentioned at 12 step meetings! Informed consent isn't given to new or potential members, and many new or potential members head out to AA and the offshoot groups believing that this way is the only way to \\"get better\\".<br /><br />When new or potential members question the dogma, they are told to \\"stop their stinkin' thinking!\\" They are told that that they must not question, just DO the steps, attend the meetings, get a sponsor, etc.  They are told that their questioning is a sign of their illness.  They are told they are CHRONICALLY ill, that their diseases (no matter which one we're talking about!) are progressive, that they will die or land in jail without the group.  FOREVER! For one doesn't \\"graduate\\" from recovery. ONe doesn't \\"recover\\" in recovery! One is in a permanent, neverending state of recovery for the rest of her life when adhering to the 12 step model!  And, they are told that the fellowship must come before their own personal needs and the needs of their families.  They are indoctrinated, pure and simple, with rhetoric and slogans and dogma that effectively puts them in a Catch-22 situation.  If the potential member believes he or she has a problem, he or she does have a problem. If, on the other hand, he or she doesn't believe that he or she has a problem, they are exhibiting denial, which proves that he or she has a problem-- or, I should say, disease.<br /><br />And, this is a DISEASE with NO CURE, according to 12 steppers! It is imperative, for his \\"recovery\\" that the \\"diseased\\" recognizes he has a PERMANENT condition and accepts that he is powerless over his life and addiction and that he accepts that God will save him if he permits God into his life.  This is the therapeutic model of the 12 step groups.  In addition, once he is into the group for awhile, he will learn that the 12 steps were \\"divinely inspired\\" and given to Bill W. to record.  Maybe he will carry the Big Book around with his the way evangelical Christians carry the Bible with them. . . and make notations in it and tab it and refer to it for guidance.  He will be encouraged to only read program \\"literature\\".<br /><br />Many 12 steppers believe that the 12 steps should be brought into the schools and used as a way of life beginning in the kids' school years-- to ward off negative habits (or diseases, as the 12 steppers refer to them) from happening.<br /><br />This is NOT a quit-drinking program! This is NOT a quit-having-neuroses program! As a matter of fact, it follows no therapeutic model that is known elsewhere. What other therapeutic model requires or strongly suggests that one spends an abundance of time with other self-professed sick people? Do therapists recommend that schizophrenics spend all their time with other schizophrenics to get healthy? Or, would it make more sense to surround one's self with healthy people who are role-modeling healthy behavior?<br /><br />Obviously, I'm a 12-step skepticist.  However, I wasn't always this way.  I've only become this way after educating myself to what is going on here in America.  Living a healthy life is our choice.  We have free will to make choices, bad or good.  There is no disease in the world that causes one to continually stop at the liquor store, open the bottle, pour it into a glass and bring it up to one's lips and then swallow.  And then do it again.  We have to figure out why we choose this even when negative consequences are resulting.  Not label ourselves diseased and live our lives in constant neverending recovery.to what is going on here in America.  Living a healthy life is our choice.

Overcoming your Alcohol, Drug, and Recovery Habits is an excellent book.  It is thorough, scientifically sound, and effective.  It is geared mostly to those who have had experiences in 12-step constant recovery, but would also be very useful and helpful to those who have not had personal experiences in the 12 step programs.<br /><br />Some reviewers seemed to be offended or bothered by the Desena's  constant criticism towards AA and its offshoot programs.  Those reviewers missed the point, I think, entirely.  AA has-- by it's OWN account-- only a 5% success rate. Some studies have put this rate at between 2-5%.  Additionally, because AA adheres to the faulty disease model regarding alcoholism and addiction, AAers believe they are ALWAYS sick and ALWAYS in need of neverending recovery, meetings, contact with their sponsors, contact with other self-professed sick people, ad infinitum.  AA is dogmatic and encourages members not to think, just do the program.  If members continue to think, and question and criticize the AA credo, they are accused of being in denial. It's a lose-lose scenario.<br /><br />Desena is attempting to educate the public about the truth of 12 step recovery programs.  Common belief is that AA works. The truth is that it doesn't work for 95% or more of those who try it.  Actually, it might be a lot less than that because that 5% are only those that remain members.  Those members that remain aren't counted because they remain sober, they're counted because they remain members.  AA expects these members to have occasional relapses.  So, we're not even talking about a SOBER 5%, necessarily. We're just talking about membership.<br /><br />Harvard University estimates that those that quit without AA have a success rate of between 77-82%.<br /><br />People need to know the truth, and the truth is hard to find unless we're lucky enough to be exposed to authors such as Desena, Peele, Schaler, Trimpey, Ellis, Fingarette, Horvath, etc.  The mainstream media accepts the disease model and AA as the \\"only\\" effective treatment as do our schools, courts, etc.  The word has to get out that not only isn't AA the only effective treatment, it's the LEAST effective treatment.  To go a step further, it's not just the LEAST effective treatment, it's downright detrimental treatment!  Imagine being told that you are powerless, have no control, are doomed to suffer from alcoholism and/or addiction your entire life, NEED AA to survive, must go to meetings on a daily basis, must do the steps, accept God into your life, have a spiritual awakening, admit your failures to others, spend your social time with other self-professed sick people, must put your sponsor above your family, live only for today (not set healthy goals for your future), are doomed to death or jail without AA, are doomed to relapse in the future, put the fellowship first at all times, stop thinking independently, stop questioning, listen to the same stories over and over again, etc., etc.  Imagine this.  This is OBVIOUSLY detrimenal, not helpful.  Yet, most of us accept this propaganda as truth.  In this book, Desena mentions Hitler's concept of the big lie: repeat it often enough, and people will believe it.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of Desena's book is that his model to quit your addiction is identical in every single way to Jack Trimpey's model in Rational Recovery.  Not only is it identical (Trimpey calls the addictive voice the \\"beast\\", while Desena calls it \\"the parasite\\"), he even uses the same words to describe the addict's feelings (the word ambivalence in a specific context-- not how it's commonly used). This was a put off.<br /><br />However, at the same time, I found the book very helpful, and the rest of the book was full of useful information, so I gave it 4 stars.  Additionally, as good as Jack Trimpey's book is, it hasn't been updated in awhile and some of the information in it regarding his Rational Recovery program is a little outdated, sothis is a good book just because it's newer and the information that Desena has IS up to date.  Still, the approach to quit IS so identical, I'm surprised that Desena had the nerve to state it was original.  It would have made more sense if Trimpey and Desena collaborated on a new book.  The other thing is, if you are just interested in the basic program to quit drinking and not the deprogramming aspect of the book, you can find most of the information on Jack Trimpey's site for free.  He offers the basic program (which is identical to Desena's) on his website at no cost, and you can get a great idea of how it works.

Brought up in rural Sudan, his village was raided, most of the adults killed, and most of the children taken into slavery.  Frances was 7 when this happened and forced to live through horror after horror without any kindness, any love, without any affection.<br /><br />Frances saw adults and children brutally murdered and it was clear to him that fighting back would cause him to also be one of the casualties.<br /><br />Frances was kept in a barn, given scraps of food to eat, refused any kindness.  Even the children of his captor were horrible to him.  What kept Frances going was the love that had been given to him before captivity and the belief that some of his family may  have survived.  Indeed, there is a bittersweet ending to Bok's story.<br /><br />Frances, gratefully and amazingly, does escape and live to share his memoir.  When I read this book last year, I participated on a message board.  I tried to share this book with educated people who adamantly refused to recognize that this story isn't all that  unusual.  This is STILL happening today.  The perpetrators of these crimes are from a culture that devalues those that are different.  Slavery, genital mutilation, abuse to women, honor killings. . . it seems as if, although we hear of these stories on a daily basis, we are still reluctant to characterize the culture as faulty.  And, so it continues.	2005-07-15

Charles Bufe is another one of the authors out there who is being incorrectly accused of having an axe to grind.  I remember writing another review about a book with a controversial subject.  The true believers are angry when anyone criticizes their belief system.  Everything they have is tied up in their AA identity.  To prove it false is to take away their entire belief system.  I feel for these people.<br /><br />At the same time, the truth about AA needs to continue to be exposed.  The author is doing our entire country a service by sharing this truthful (sourced thoroughly) information.  Further, not only is AA not successful to over 95% of those that try it, it's the LEAST successful program out there!  And, to go even further, not only is it the lease successful program out there, it's even DETRIMENTAL!  Harvard University released a study that said 77-82% of those that quit successfully do it without AA.  The 5% that AA is successful for are the 5% of those that remain members.  Not necessarily SOBER members, just members.  Relapses, according to the AA data, have nothing to do with counting the success rate.<br /><br />THe problem is that AA and the twelve-step system have infiltrated our country.  That sounds extreme, but it's true.  Who comes to our kids' schools to talk about drug abuse? \\"Recovering\\" addicts.  Who represents the treatment industry on TV and in the media? \\"Recovering\\" drug addicts.  Who, reading these reviews, has not been consistently exposed to the phrases, \\"working the program\\", \\"It works if you work it\\", \\"let go and let God\\"?  I have never had an addiction problem, but even I knew of these slogans.  AA has been accepted as the answer to addiction.  However, it's a cult.<br /><br />Those seeking to end their alcohol dependence are vulnerable.  Additionally, often their esteem has suffered.  The unconditional acceptance they receive from other \\"recovering\\" addicts is appealing-- especially if they've already lost their other primary relationships due to their drug/alcohol use.  Once they recieve the love bomb, the rest of the indoctrination can take place.<br /><br />AA members are taught they NEED AA.  They are taught that the 'fellowship' must come first-- before their own needs and the needs of their families.  They are taught that they MUST attend meetings if they are to stay sober.  They are taught that it's their best thinking was a detriment (after all, it got them to this point), they are taught that they should not think, just do the steps, go to meetings, talk to their sponsors, socialize with other self-professed chronically sick people, and always stay in recovery, after all, it's alcoholISm, not alcoholWASm.  The horrors that await those who leave AA are jail or death.  They say relapse is unavoidable and one NEEDS AA.  They TEACH addicts to be sick.<br /><br />Everything in Bufe's book needs to be exposed and known.  If one is seeking help for an addiction, how often is he or she given other information besides AA? Hardly ever! AA continues to be touted as the one that works, and it's a complete falsehood. It's not a quit-drinking program, it's a religion.  It's the religion of Bill Wilson and those that are true believers believe that the Big Book was inspired by God himself.

Even the reviewer from Egypt knows this happened.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems as if people just do not want to face the truth about a culture that minimizes or degrades the role of women in society.  Souad's story is NOT the exception to the rule. Honor killings happen more often than we know.  The problem I think the reviewers are having is that Souad lived and is drawing attention to a problem that exists, usually silencing the victims.  Here's a case where the victim wasn't silenced afterall.<br /><br />From day ONE, boys are welcomed and girls are not.  Furthermore, men can have up to four wives.  They do not consult their first wife and ask her if they will accept wife number 2,3, or 4!  One can argue that it's a cultural preference and he or she would be correct that it's a cultural preference for the men.  From what I've read, it's usually not the preference for the women involved although, admittedly, many do not question their fate.  Practicing monogomy increases the woman's value in our society.  Although Souad's father did NOT have other wives, the value system those in these countries have specifically devalue women.  The Taliban in Afghanistan was borne from orthodoxy in Islam.  Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia is also extreme.<br /><br />The author's retelling of her story was moving.  She freely admits that some memories are unclear.  She's tormented about the fact that she cannot remember her sister's name.  She recounts her life, however, with extreme honesty.  She's emotional, yet removed.  I am happy that this woman is living happily presently and has reunited with her son, noting that she still has to deal with her literal and figurative scars of her former life.<br /><br />This might not be a usual story, but it is indeed representative of this repressive and misogynistic culture.	2005-07-15

It's true: our culture pretty much is convinced that we are all suffering from some type of disease.  There are twelve-step groups for every real and imagined disease out there! Do you know there is now a Grandchildren of Alcoholic group out there? Every neurosis has been turned into a disease.  Every personality quirk can be improved by doing the 12 step recovery program.  Note I said \\"improved\\", because one you're in a twelve-step group, you're in it for life. . . it's NEVERENDING recovery, meetings, etc.  It's not a healthy and balanced life.  You aren't supposed to surround yourself with non\\"addicts\\" because they wouldn't understand.  Surround yourself with other self-professed sickies. That'll get you healthy.  Anyone else note the irony here?<br /><br />Anyways, the only problem I had with this book is that she gave a free-pass to AA and NA and only criticized the offshoots of these groups. . . like CoDa, ACOA, Al-anon, etc.  I am of the belief that they ALL deserve equal criticism.  And, maybe AA deserves the most criticism, because if it wasn't for AA, these other groups wouldn't be in existence.  Kaminer also neglected to correct the erroneous information that AA passes along as true.  The scientific studies that have been done over the past years that prove that the disease model of addiction is incorrect.  So, I think it would have been helpful if she at least directed her readers to some of the work that has been published that is out there.  (Stanton Peele, Jeffrey Schaler, Albert Ellis, etc.)<br /><br />All in all, I thought this was an entertaining book that was mostly right on target. It's a refreshing and quick read.	2005-07-14

He makes his argument that addiction isn't caused by a mysterious disease, but that anyone who suffers from an addiction does so because they find pleasure in the use of the substance they are addicted to.<br /><br />This is a short volume that is packed with useful information.  If it had been the only book I read on the subject, I would have given it 5 stars.  Instead, though, I've been reading quite a bit on the subject, and found this slender book to be just a bit shy of of the fifth star I awarded some other authors who wrote on this subject.<br /><br />The truth of the matter is, there have been numerous studies done over the past several decades (many of which Schaler quotes).  Not ONE of them have been successful in proving that alcoholism is a disease.  Not ONE.  Yet, assuming the physicians and organizations that push AA and similar 12 step treatment are at all well-read (and, I assumed so; I mean, they were the 'experts'), they still push this alcoholism as disease concept!  If they don't read the current journals and books, why are they in their posts? Is it the massive amount of money poured into the treatment centers?  Is it really a benevolent action to encourage (or, in some cases mandate) those with addictions to enter treatment or AA when ALL of the evidence has proven that it really doesn't work?  Sometimes, believe it or not, the evidence has shown that AA and 12 step treatment is, in fact, MORE detrimental than no program at all.  As confusing as that sounds, imagine being told every day that you are powerless, lack any control, are not responsible for your desire to imbibe, etc.  Those that are indoctrinated with this belief system obviously believe they are diseased, permanently sick, permanently and forever in need of meetings, permanently and forever believe they have no control over their behavior, permanently and forever believe they have no power.  In fact, they are told and believe that they will ALWAYS be in a permanent state of \\"recovery\\".  That being \\"recovered\\" is nonsensical and elusive. . . their state, always, is \\"in\\" recovery-- they will NEVER be better. They will ALWAYS be labeled as an addict or alcoholic.  Imagine having that label for the rest of your life.<br /><br />Additionally, what makes the most sense? If one is trying to eliminate their addiction, does it make sense to hang out pretty much exclusively with other addicts and alcoholics on a daily basis? Or, does it make sense to hang out with those that have healthy balanced lives and don't \\"need a meeting\\" on a daily or almost daily basis? Common sense tells us that to BE healthy, one must have balance in their daily lives.  Work, family, recreation, etc.  How can this take place when AA members are encouraged to attend daily meetings (it's considered a badge of honor to attend meetings daily, or even two to three meetings daily!), to read only AA \\"literature\\" (ugh. I use the word literature, because that's what they call it! Did you ever critically read this material?  I wouldn't call anything AA or Bill W. has put out 'literature'), to talk to an alcoholic daily, to do service (help other alcoholics), etc.<br /><br />There is no balance in this type of life.  It's indoctrination and brainwashing. Furthermore, it has been proven NOT to be successful.

The book is cogent and intelligently written.  It's impeccably sourced.  It was a delight to read and EVERY single question and doubt I've had was answered somewhere in this volume.<br /><br />I'm troubled by the reviewer who titles his review, Disturbing, and states, \\"Any work that claims to be THE definitive answer to an enormously complex problem should be approached with caution.\\"  That sounds like a rational statement.  However, Stanton Peele's research isn't based on feeling, like the AA model.  It's based on numerous studies by many different scientists done over the past several decades that have drawn the same conclusion OVER and OVER again.  And, the conclusion is that it's NOT a disease-- despite the AMA and despite AA and despite every single organization that says it is.  The proof lies in this point-- that there hasn't been even ONE successful study that has proven otherwise-- even when the study was created to PROVE that it was a disease.<br /><br />AA ADMITS in it's own data that only 5% of AA members remain alcohol abstinent.  The data that has been proven over and over again is that this number is LESS than those that quit drinking without AA.  Additionally, a recent Harvard University Study stated that 80% of those that have quit drinking did it on their own.  This goes against the disease model and AA approach.  Many can moderate their drinking successfully or quit successfully altogether. This goes against the disease model and AA approach, too.  Stanton Peele's book shows us the studies and data that support that once addicted DOES NOT MEAN ALWAYS ADDICTED.  Unless, of course, one has bought into the AA philosophy and has now accepted that they are permanently sick and out of control.  This is the crux of this argument.  Studies have shown that those that have bought into this philosophy wind up having a lower self-image than those that have not, and they wind up believing they are permanently sick and completely unable to manage their lives-- thereby buying into the belief that they are \\"out of control\\".  The focus is never about getting better in AA (I know they say otherwise)-- the focus is on STAYING 'sick', STAYING in AA, and STAYING permanently in a \\"RECOVERY\\" state. The focus, truthfully, is in keeping old folkwisdom alive even though every bit of evidence shows us that there are proven better ways. To add insult to injury, anyone who doubts this model is accused of being in denial, and everyone who remains alcohol abstinent without AA is accused of being a dry drunk (not \\"sober\\" according to AAspeak).

Nevertheless, if you read both books, you will gain information from both books. If you are feeling as if you are suffering and might not be able to focus on the more scholarly Truth About Addiction, then definitely pick up this book.  You will be educated about the addiction process, about the pseudo-science that has pushed the disease model, and you will be given the tools you need to moderate your drinking or quit your drinking altogether.<br /><br />Stanton Peele's research isn't based on feeling, like the AA model of alcoholism-as-a-disease.  It's based on numerous studies by many different scientists done over the past several decades that have drawn the same conclusion OVER and OVER again.  And, the conclusion is that it's NOT a disease-- despite the AMA and despite AA and despite every single organization that says it is.  The proof lies in this point-- that there hasn't been even ONE successful study that has proven otherwise-- even when the study was created to PROVE that alcohol dependence was a disease.<br /><br />AA ADMITS in it's own data that only 5% of AA members remain alcohol abstinent.  The data that has been proven over and over again is that this number is LESS than those that quit drinking without AA.  Additionally, a recent Harvard University Study stated that 80% of those that have quit drinking did it on their own.  This goes against the disease model and AA approach.  Many can moderate their drinking successfully or quit successfully altogether. This goes against the disease model and AA approach, too.  Stanton Peele's book shows us the studies and data that support that once addicted DOES NOT MEAN ALWAYS ADDICTED.  Unless, of course, one has bought into the AA philosophy and has now accepted that they are permanently sick and out of control.  This is the crux of this argument.  Studies have shown that those that have bought into this philosophy wind up having a lower self-image than those that have not, and they wind up believing they are permanently sick and completely unable to manage their lives-- thereby buying into the belief that they are \\"out of control\\".  The focus is never about getting better in AA (I know they say otherwise)-- the focus is on STAYING 'sick', STAYING in AA, and STAYING permanently in a \\"RECOVERY\\" state.

US	27992471	RHUII4KCRA6KY	1558741127	501140521	Adult Children of Alcoholics	Books	1	15	95	N	N	worst book ever	Here's another basing her hypothesis on what? The absence of scientific data? There is absolutely NO evidence that shows alcoholism is a disease.  And, now, with people like this author, we want to name every neurosis a disease.  Do you know there is (no kidding) a group now called Adult Grandchildren of Alcoholics? Come on!!!<br /><br />Here's a bit of proof of Woititz' absurdity:<br /><br />For Woititz' dissertation, she did a study that compared Alateen teens to similar teens with alcoholic parents. Her study proved that the teens that weren't affiliated with Alateen had higher self-esteem and were happier people. Wanting to forward her theories, however, she concluded that the REASON non-Alateen teenagers had higher self-esteem was because they were \\"in denial\\".<br /><br />So, in conclusion, we should join one of these 12 step groups based on folklore and decades old pseudo-science and lower our self-esteem and happiness level.  Then, according to Woititz, we will be healthy--albeit unhappy with lower esteem.<br /><br />Where is the common sense in this country?<br /><br />Please, instead of this book, pick up \\"The Diseasing of America\\", by Stanton Peele.  Or, Wendy Kaminer's \\"I'm dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional\\".  Start focusing on healthy behavior instead of wallowing in self-pity with these 12-step pity-parties.	2005-07-14

However, even I was a little put off by his anti-AA comments initially.  I turned around, though, when I learned more.  Those anti-AA comments are necessary for those of us in the public who haven't learned the truth about AA yet.  And, it's impossible to learn the truth because schools, courts, television, articles, and \\"experts\\", seem to all spew the same party line. . . that AA is the \\"only way\\" and that AA is successful.<br /><br />In fact, AA is not the only way to be successful, and all of the studies that has been done over the years have proven that alcoholism is NOT a disease and that AA and 12 step treatment is absolutely NOT successful.  In fact, there have been studies that prove those that quit drinking using AA are LESS successful than those that quit without AA.  So, to the reviewer who passes on the erroneous information that AA has a proven track record, the truth is that AA does NOT have a proven track record. Or, to be more concise, their proven track record is that it doesn't work for 95% or MORE of the people that try it.  Some evidence has shown that it's actually DETRIMENTAL to those trying to quit drinking.  And, evidence has shown MORE people are successful on their own.  Furthermore, those that try and \\"recover\\" with AA-- who have been indoctrinated with the AA philosophy (pure folkwisdom) have a MORE difficult time moderating or abstaining than those who haven't been brainwashed into believing they ar powerless and have no control over their addictions.  For a more comprehensive look at this, look at The Truth About Addiction and Recovery, by Stanton Peele.  Peele doesn't share his opinions only, he shares his opinions based on the results of many many studies done over the past decades. . . even the studies that AA quotes as proof for the disease model.  Peele gives the entire story and sources it thoroughly.<br /><br />Go do a search with the words \\"aa cult\\" and read what you come up with.  AA is indocrination, pure and simple.  It's not a quit drinking program.  And, unfortunately, those schools that introduce 12step programs, court officials, television shows, articles, and \\"experts\\" either don't know the truth or have a hidden agenda (like the massive money poured into treatment centers that have been scientifically proven not to be successful).  My point is, somebody has to speak the truth and I completely respect Trimpey for doing so.<br /><br />AVRT works and it's SIMPLE.  Trimpey's correct.  Make the decision to quit, do it, and go work on your life if you need to. If you have anger problems while you're drinking, you might have anger problems when you quit.  But, at least your mind will be clear from the alcohol and you will be actually able to WORK on those anger problems.<br /><br />Or, end up in neverending \\"recovery\\"-- only socializing with other addicts and self-professed sick people.  WHich makes more sense? Surrounding yourself with others that profess to be sick and need the comfort of other sick people for daily meetings for decades? Or, does it make more sense to take charge of your life and  live in a healthy balanced way while surrounding yourself with others that live balanced and healthy lives?<br /><br />The absolute only fault I have with this book is that, despite the fact Trimpey does not accept the disease-model of alcoholism as a disease, he firmly believes one can never drink again.  In fact, studies have proven that many have successfully moderately drank again although they once struggled with addiction.  Once the addiction is conquered, it's conquered. In theory, then, one could moderately drink sometime in the future.  As a matter of fact, it has been also shown that those who DO drink moderately in the future are, in fact, more well-adjusted than those that permanently abstain or drink too much.<br /><br />This is really a small issue, though.

If you are the spouse, parent, child, or sibling of an alcoholic, you are sick. You need Al-Anon. What can I say about this but that this, in itself, is sick, sick, sick.  Not only that, it's a bit hypocritical because of the simple fact that you are there because of your relationship with the alcoholic or addict.  So, even though Al-Anon is for YOU, the very nature of the program is based on the premise that you are sick because you are in a relationship with an alcoholic or addict-- thereby making the program a little bit about them, afterall.<br /><br />This book is filled with Al-Anon members' stories.  Some of them are a bit uplifting, I suppose, but many (many!) of them are just horrid, and proof to me that Al-Anon is a supreme joke.<br /><br />Some of these folks have absolutely no boundaries.  In Al-Anon, one isn't supposed to call another on his or her lack of boundaries.  So, we're not to judge when we read about two women in this book who decided to forgive their husbands after they molested their children?  I guess that's the message here.  We aren't supposed to think that several women are insane to stay with their consistently untrustworthy and philandering spouses? If you are following the Al-Anon recovery program, I suppose that's right, too.<br /><br />Al-Anon was started by the wives of the founders of AA, probably since they were stuck at home all night alone since their husbands were out at meetings and trying to save other alcoholics.  One of the founders, Bill Wilson, was also a huge womanizer after he became \\"sober\\"-- doing what's called in AA, the 13th step.  Her choice was to remain married to him.<br /><br />By the way, AA only has a 2-5% recovery rate. Personally, I recommend Jeffrey Schaler's Addiction is a Choice, Stanton Peele's work, and Albert Ellis' work, as well.<br /><br />Good luck!	2005-07-07

However, if the environment is entirely sick and you have children involved, how can you justify staying?  This book IS helpful if that's your decision, but the truth is, you'd be better off thinking about holding an intervention and help the person.  They don't have to hit bottom and you don't have to settle for a life loneliness and sadness and disappointment.  Drunks are irrational, illogical, and can be MEAN.  If you are in a relationship with someone exhibiting these characteristics secondary to alcohol abuse, why would you stay indefinitely?<br /><br />There is an answer and that answer is an intervention (yes, I know that some disagree with that concept.  I think interventions, though, are useful.  But don't send them to the cult of AA afterwards. . . get them into detox and then someplace far away from AA. . . like on a plane to Rational Recovery in California or into some REBT therapy.  .  )80% of interventions are successful in the sense that they get treatment.  But, as the interventionist would say, ALL interventions are successful because even if the addict refuses treatment, you have made boundaries.  You have made decisions. You have the opportunity knowing you did all you can do.<br /><br />Since writing this review, I came across more information regarding this author.  So, as an addendum, I want to say that Janet Woititz is a nut.  For her dissertation, she did a study that compared Alateen teens to similar teens with alcoholic parents.  Her study proved that the teens that weren't affiliated with Alateen had higher self-esteem and were happier people.  Wanting to forward her theories, she concluded that the REASON non-Alateen teenagers had higher self-esteem was because they were \\"in denial\\".  12-step groups are based on the alcoholism-as-disease-model.  There is absolutely no evidence of this. On the contrary, the evidence points to addiction being a choice or a negative BEHAVIOR.<br /><br />Janet Woititz forwards this crazy pseudo-science.  You'd be better off reading Jeffrey Schaler, Stanton Peele, Jack Trimpey, or Albert Ellis.  Not only will their scientifically-sound theories enlighten you to the truth, you will be able to make decisions regarding YOUR life based on fact, not feeling, and not the neverending, always-in-\\"recovery\\", \\"i need a meeting\\" philosophy.

I've been hesitant to purchase these types of books specifically for women, but did so once I saw the great reviews written here.<br /><br />The great reviews here are well deserved.  This is an AMAZING book.  THis is the most thorough book I've seen on weight training.  This book answered EVERY question that other books left unanswered.  In addition, the workouts that are included in here are excellent. Not many books teach you how to alter your workout from day to day, from week to week, and from month to month. This one does.<br /><br />An avid exerciser, I have been doing these workouts for a week.  And, every day, I've been sore. I've felt muscles that I didn't realize I had.  I used to weight train 3 days per week and do cardio three days per week. Now I've increased my weight training to six days per week and my cardio to six days per week, also.  Each exercise is COMPLETELY explained in a way I've never seen before. If one follows the author's instruction, proper form is guaranteed.<br /><br />Included are workouts for the absolute beginner, for the not-so-new beginner, for the advanced exerciser, and for those who don't have any body fat to lose, but want to gain muscle.  For the advanced exerciser (which is what I'm doing), there are so many variations and routines that can follow you through 6 weeks. After that, you may want to cut your weight training back, or continue along those lines.  I work out at home and am able to do these on my well-equipped home gym.  Otherwise, I'd have to go to the gym.  The basic workouts can be done at home with dumbbells and a bench.<br /><br />This is my favorite book on this subject. As a matter of fact, I'm going to be taking a break from reading any other books on this subject for awhile. . . since everything I need to know at this time is included here. I may pick up the abs book, too, but that would be only because I'm so impressed with this book.

It's well-written, informative, and covers both diet and workouts. George believes that women should train up to 6 days per week with an emphasis on lower body rather than upper body.  Many training books emphasize letting the trained body parts rest for at least 48 hours.  Some, including George, realize that women don't want to LOOK like men--that is, get bigger and more muscular (they want to get smaller and more toned and defined)--they shouldn't train like men, either.<br /><br />To be honest, I only glanced over the men's routines, which may also advocate training daily.  I'm not really sure what to make of that, if that's the case.<br /><br />Ideally, George believes, one should be aspiring to 60minutes of cardio per day and then also, up to 6 days of his 10, 20, or 30 minute resistance/strength training.  His routines are fully illustrated with complete notes.<br /><br />The reason I gave this a 3 star, rather than higher (I almost gave it a 4) is because I think the routines are difficult in the sense that they comprise many compound moves that workout different muscle groups simultaneously.  And, I don't mean lunges or squats while doing bicep curls at the same time.  His moves are truly unique-- many exercises are comprised of at least 5 entirely separate moves.  This is just a little daunting to me in book form.  In gym class? Yes. With a workout dvd?  Absolutely.  But, with a book I just find it too difficult to really follow without compromising my form by referring to the book a zillion times.  And, that's what I'd have to do for quite a while since there are three different workouts with very many different exercises that are comprised of very many movements that are supposed to be done smoothly without taking a break to consult the book yet another time.<br /><br />That said, if there was a dvd to go along with this, I'd be interested in trying it. Half the workouts I do are comprised of compound movements similar to these. . . but I follow along. . . much easier than having to stop once again to consult the book and read the very-lengthy exercise instructions.<br /><br />This DOES come with a dvd, but it's not a workout dvd. . .it's a motivational training guide.<br /><br />One more thing that's worth mentioning. George specifically advocates Dr. Barry Sears' The Zone diet. This, if you're not familiar with it, is 40% carbs, 30% protein, and 30% fat. Many eating plans still believe that we need 50% carbs if we're exercising a lot. George's plan does advocate a lot of exercise, and some may feel that this amount of carbs just isn't enough.comprised of compound movements similar to these. . . but I follow along. . . much easier than having to stop once again to consult the book and read the very-lengthy exercise instructions. <br /> <br />This DOES come with a dvd, but it's not a workout dvd. . .it's a motivational training guide. <br /> <br />One more thing that's worth mentioning.

I was not disappointed with The Queen's Fool.  From start to finish, the author draws the reader in with Hannah Green's story of leaving Spain during the Inquisition, working with her father, being begged for a Holy Fool by Sir Robert Dudley, and her access to the Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth.  Admittedly, you may wish to knock some sense into Hannah once or twice.<br /><br />It's an exciting read. Philippa Gregory really made Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth come alive in this book. For those who know a bit about the Tudors, the author's story weaves fact and fiction together seamlessly.  Queen Mary's descent into fear, hopelessness, heartbreak, and revenge--her change from hopeful Queen into Bloody Mary is described.  Elizabeth's character isn't neglected, either.<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting The Virgin's Lover and look forward to reading this book, too.	2005-05-18

I disagree. I think, if you're interested in the Scott Peterson case and want to read more information about it, this book will fit the bill.  She has a story to tell and she went through quite a bit of emotional anguish.  This book clearly isn't about making money, although, really, I don't see the harm in that.  It's clearly about telling her story and clearing up misconceptions that may have been formed about her.<br /><br />Amber's tale IS interesting. She is an honest woman who found herself involved with a dishonest unscrupulous sociopathic man.  There is information here that the media couldn't tell us and some more insight into Scott's terrifying amoral behavior.<br /><br />As an added plus, Amber's life can actually be considered inspirational.  She honestly admits the poor choices she's made in the past and discusses how she overcame all of the obstacles she's faced.	2005-05-18

However, it seemed to be geared towards the very beginner, even though he says that's not the case and even though the exercise regime isn't too easy.<br /><br />Additionally, as reading material goes, it's not interesting. He is not a great writer, doesn't seem to ahve a sense of humor at all, and, too much I think, keeps on going back to emotional eating.<br /><br />For emotional eating, please pick up The Thin Commandments Diet-- really one of the best books I have read that deals with clear guidelines to get one PAST emotional eating. This book doesn't do it.<br /><br />Exercise information is good, but I really think Gunnar Peterson's new book, G-Force, is much better and will carry you through much further than this book will.<br /><br />I do agree with Greene's recommendation of Eating for Life, Bill Phillips' diet plan. THat's an excellent book and I completely recommend it.  Furthermore, Bill Phillips' Body for LIfe is a better book for both exercise, fitness, and nutrition.<br /><br />I do also like how Bob Greene keeps reminding us that not all exercise is created equal. That what's recommended for basic health is really a lot less than needed to reshape your body.	2005-05-18

It is one of the most informative, well-written, and clearly explained books of its kind.  And, to top it off, Gunnar Peterson is FUNNY! Peterson very wittily explains the basics-- and more-- of fitness and working out. I laughed out loud when reading his tongue-in-cheek humor while absorbing all the information he was sharing.  He explains the top 13 exercises, fully explains them with photographs and illustrations, and then also gives the reader derivatives of those exercises so that one can vary their workout as recommended-- every 3 to 4 weeks.<br /><br />One of the reviewers here complained that the book left out certain important exercises such as deadlifts, in particular. This is true. However, the top 13 exercises that Peterson recommends happen to not include deadlifts.  This doesn't mean he doesn't include exercises that work one's hamstrings, glutes, and quads. . . it just means that he included exercises other than deadlifts. Additionally, if you're truly committed to learning how to successfully work out, perform exercises, etc., you may have been reading other books, as well, which will include deadlifts.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of this book, that would have reduced my rating to a four, was it's lack of diet information.  However, as I thought about that more, I decided that the book deserved a 5 star for it's thorough coverage of exercise and weight training.  In that sense, the workouts covered are good for everyone--no matter what eating plan they are following (as long as it's healthy).  Maybe that's even better. If you are following an eating plan that makes sense for you, is healthy and varied, and are ready to add weight training into the mix, this book is for you. If you are ready to even take your routine up a notch, are doubting your form, are not seeing the results you wish (while confident your diet is appropriate), then this book is for you, too.  It's great.  It's as informative as Body for Life by Bill Phillips (who I also do not find megalomaniacal as the one reviewer asserts) and as well-written. Additionally, Peterson is more flexible with his workout routines and explains how to vary them.  There aren't a lot of books for beginners on this subject. And, again, this book isn't just for beginners, it's really for anyone interested in fitness.<br /><br />Completely recommended.  Remember, though, Peterson does not include a recommended eating plan, although he makes sure you realize that a healthy diet is imperative to achieve the results he discusses in his book.o I also do not find megalomaniacal as the one reviewer asserts) and as well-written.

Sodium, carbs, cholesterol, calories, and fat grams, but sugar content is nowhere to be found.

As a matter of fact, many of the reviewers who reviewed this book negatively state that Trifkovic is an Islam hater and, because he isn't Muslim or because he's not an admirer of the Arab culture and Islamic religion, his opinion should be disregarded.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Who would you want to get valid information from?  Someone who studied and formed a valid opinion based on fact and history? Or, someone born into Islam-- a religion that, according to the Koran, it is blasphemous to critique and question?  It's not that Trifkovic disliked Islam and then decided to condemn it, it's that he learned about it, studied it, and drew these conclusions based on what he learned.  And, he learned it from history, from Islamic scholars and from the Koran.<br /><br />Trifkovic's book is one of the best on the subject. He sources all of his material abundantly.  He is concise. He states opposing viewpoints and common beliefs and refutes them irrefutably.  He cites the Koran and sources the place.  This isn't opinion Trifkovic shares.  These are facts that he enlightens his readers with.  There really isn't too much room for debate, because he is only citing facts that have happened in history and the Koran itself.  And, as you can guess, he's not an apologist by any means.<br /><br />The common belief that Islam is a \\"religion of peace\\" is false.  According to Islam, we are always in the \\"house of war\\", but strive to be in the \\"house of peace\\".  What's the house of peace, you ask? Well, according to Islam, we will be in the \\"house of peace\\" when the whole world is Muslim.  And, the whole world will be Muslim by committing Jihad.  These are the facts of Islam.  Like it or not.  What is going on in Sudan? What was the Beslan school massacre about? The Southern Philippines and elsewhere?

I believe it; the book is a much heftier novel and much more interesting than the overhyped Da Vinci Code.  This is literature. The Da Vinci code is pulp fiction.<br /><br />I bought this book and wound up having no interest to start it until a month or so after my purchase.  Oh, but when I did! What a novel!  The story is almost perfect.  Although compared to The Da Vinci code, it's a hundred times better. . . both the story and the writing.<br /><br />The only flaw I had with the book was the villain.

The memoir is heart-wrenching (save the Princess' clear anti-Semitism), but the writing just doesn't flow.  At all.  Nevertheless, I had a hard time putting it down, and read it in one sitting. And, then I read her other books, too.<br /><br />Life in Saudi Arabia is awful.  Life under Shari'a is awful.  Life in the misogynistic Islamic society is awful.  That is the thrust and truth of this book.  And, although the princess is a very faithful believer-- and although she questions the lack of freedom women in her culture have-- she doesn't make the connection that is so easy for many of us here to see.  Her country follows Shari'a which is mandated in the Koran.  She's critical of the laws of Saudi Arabia but doesn't have the courage to critically question the foundation of those laws-- the Koran.  Of course, if she did, she'd be considered blasphemous and consequently killed living over there. So, maybe SECRETLY she does.  But, outwardly, she praised Islam and Allah and the Prophet just enough-- maybe in case her identity was discovered. . . which, of course, it eventually was (see follow up books).<br /><br />When reading this book, keep in mind that it was written by a princess-- a woman afforded many of the luxuries and freedoms that a commoner would not have.  And, STILL, she is repressed and imprisoned.  She, at least, can go to New York and spend $250K in one weekend (which she does).  Imagine the life of someone less privileged.  Ugh. Truly hellish.<br /><br />Here is a culture that okays honor killings, stonings, polygamy.  Here is a culture where woman cannot leave the house without a father, brother, or husband acting as chaperone.  Where she can't drive.  Where she is fed anti-American and anti-Israeli propaganda from day one. Where she's at the mercy of her husband or father's whim.  Where women are not appreciated as intellectual equals.  Where intellectualism is discouraged, religious criticism condemned and deemed criminal.<br /><br />Well, thank goodness I live in a free society founded on Judeo-Christian values.  This memoir is another proof that although many cite the commonalities between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, the fact is that Islam is not compatible or even favorably comparable with Christianity and Judaism (and even many Eastern religions) and that it is absolutely not a religion of peace.

This book can work alone or with your current weight loss regimen.  Although Stephen Gullo includes a 10 day diet plan to get started, he advocates any nutritional weight loss program that is right for you.  That means, unlike so many other books today, he doesn't bash other plans.<br /><br />Gullo gives you 10 strategies to learn how to deal with food. I wonder if there is really anyone out there who records inspirational messages for themselves. I can't imagine doing this. However, if I had consistently failed at so many diets, maybe I would.<br /><br />What I found most fascinating about this book was the idea of one's food history.  That is, there are some of us that can NEVER have a chocolate chip cookie, NEVER have a piece of cake, etc.  Our history is our behavior with a certain food.  If we've always, in the past, wound up finishing the Pepperidge Farm Milano cookie sack, or always finish the bag of potato chips, Gullo makes the argument that we should learn to consistently make the choice to abstain from these foods.  For some of us, he reminds us, one bite is never one bite.  One bite leads either to two hundred bites or thinking about another bite until we cave in.  I had never heard this spoken about and this, above all his other commandments, was worth the price of this book.<br /><br />Gullo also gives sources for some of the foods he recommends that aren't likely to be found at your local grocery.  This, too, is thorough and worthwhile.  He talks about specific foods that I didn't necessarily know were even available.  Having these foods available make watching what you're eating that much easier.  Among these are walden farms' calorie free (yes, calorie free!) salad dressings, spaghetti sauces, and syrups, as well as vitamuffins-- 100 calorie delicious muffins that are as nutritious as whole wheat toast and peanut butter but tastes like the richest chocolate cake.<br /><br />I completely recommend Stephen Gullo's book for absolutely anyone who is trying to either lose weight or learn about proper nutrition and health.

At that time, I found his story compelling and picked up this book to learn more about him.<br /><br />Knowing all the while of David's suicide while reading this book was difficult.  One can only sympathize with David as a little boy, as an adolescent, and, of course, as that poor little baby who was horribly castrated.<br /><br />John Colapinto tells David's story with Grace and empathy. Although striving to remain objective, one can read the pain the author felt on David's behalf while writing and reporting this story.<br /><br />In one day, the lives of these parents and this baby changed forever.  ALthough a baby myself when this occurred, one can only wonder why the parents thought this option--of raising their baby boy as a girl-- was the better option.  There was some thought of rebuilding his genitalia (though this type of surgery was less advanced than it is today), but the parents chose, on the advice of the medical quack/expert, to raise him as a girl.  I know that back then, patients questioned the doctors less than they do now, but their choice still seems to be more extreme than reconstructive surgery would have been.<br /><br />David married and seemed to be happy at the end of the book.  I wish we knew more about him as an adult.  I grew to care about him and am sorry he was unable to find happiness afterall.	2005-05-10

Still, because of the subject matter, I think it's an important read and one that can shed some light on how women are treated in this backward misogynistic Saudi culture.<br /><br />Wahhabism is unforgiving-- a strict and literal Koranic interpretation, and what is practiced in the country of the Bin Ladens.  Carmen Bin Laden was fortunate enough to only have to spend part of her time here; she also lived in the United States and Europe.<br /><br />She shares with us what it is like to be a woman in such a repressive culture.  The women she knew there who were raised that way didn't even question the status quo. That, in itself, would be blasphemous to do, since women are taught to believe that the way they are living is the way Allah wishes them to live.  They are literally second class citizens.  And, imagine what happens to men who live among themselves being taught to believe that they are superior to women in such a grand way? Well, they believe it.  And, they treat \\"their women\\" more like pets than as partners.  Marriage isn't considered a partnership there.  How can it be when men are permitted 4 wives and the women often are not able to choose their mates or the three other women who may share their lives.  In Bin Laden's book, the women accept their lives and are unquestioning regarding their state.  In other memoirs I've read regarding Islamic life, some of the women do indeed question their status but they just do not have the power to try and change it.<br /><br />Although this book may have included detail of day to day life in Saudi Arabia, it seemed to lack some emotion regarding its horrors.  The author didn't share as much how she felt so, at times, it seemed to be more of the sharing of facts rather than the sharing of her feelings regarding these facts-- which is what makes great memoirs great.<br /><br />Still, it's worthwhile reading and another indicator of why Islam is so incompatible with Western Civilization.  We all may know by now that Islam is the fastest growing religion, but I'm not sure all of us are aware that Wahhabism is the fastest growing type of Islam in the United States and Europe.  As a matter of fact, the spreading of Wahhabism in prisons is a formal agenda that is funded by the Saudis. More information regarding this can be found on the web. . . just enter wahhabism prisons and see what you come up with.reading and another indicator of why Islam is so incompatible with Western Civilization.

Although I disliked this novel, I disagreed that the author failed to conclude her story properly.  The premise was very interesting: a woman left by her husband is unable to face this hardship, so she refuses to face it.  And, she lives as if he's just absent for the moment-- trying to fool everyone around her so that she may not have to grieve her loss.<br /><br />That is something I think many of us can relate to-- putting off inevitable pain until the last possible moment.  However, the author fails in her execution since we never really feel for the heroine of the story. And, in trying to put off the heartbreaking emotion the heroine is avoiding, Nina Solomon fails to capture that heartwrenching emotion in her writing. Subsequently, the writing is flat and we consequently lack empathy for the characters.<br /><br />I did read this until the end because the premise was interesting enough for me to want to discover what happens.  And, I was pleased with the ending, which I thought was clear and, considering the context, probable.  Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend this book, though I found the premise interesting enough to share in conversation.	2005-05-10

There is something about this guy that really irks me.  So, keep that in mind as you read my negative review, because I definitely could be unfairly biased.<br /><br />That said, Jorge Cruise calls the exercises he recommends \\"Cruise Moves\\".  Isn't that enough to turn one off? No longer are they ab crunches, for instance, or swiss ball balance moves, they are \\"Cruise Moves\\".  He now markets flax oil and it's \\"Jorge Cruise's Flax oil\\".<br /><br />The other criticism I have regarding this book is his recommended snacks.  Cruise has a diet plan in place that includes two snacks daily.  And, he makes no distinction in the quality of the snack as long as they are equal to approximately 100 calories each.  This means that, according to him, two oreos twice per day--every day--is just fine.  This might not interfere with weight loss, but these oreos or other foods like oreos are still devoid of any nutritional value and are still NOT good for you.  No matter what you want to believe, 200 calories per day made up of 1 tbsp of peanut butter and an apple, or a whole wheat English muffin with cinnamon are both better choices than oreos.  And, learning to choose what's better for your health in the long term--which includes learning to say \\"no\\" to oreos, is an important lesson to learn, I think.  Save those oreos for your cheat meal which you're allowed one time per week.<br /><br />He also recommends a tsp of oil with every meal.  Flax oil and other fats are very very good for you.  Although, I'm not sure it's really necessary if you are eating properly and your diet includes lots of fatty fish, like salmon, and some red meat or chicken and if you use olive oil to cook your foods in.  As healthy as certain fats are, they are still heavy in calories.  And, no matter what, we still have to burn more calories than we take in to lose weight.<br /><br />I'm optimistic that this diet will work, though.  He keeps calories to about 1425 per day for women, which is definitely reasonable for a moderately active woman.  And, the basic information is compatible with the current health information.  Eating every three hours is proven to keep your metabolism moving and to avoid going into starvation mode--which starts burning muscle for fuel-- a state we all wish to avoid.<br /><br />You might find Jorge Cruise is right for you.  The information in here isn't groundbreaking, although the media would seem to say otherwise.  Body for Life is still the best program, I think.  I also think The Thin Commandments Diet is good, as are The Abs Diet (watch portion sizes, though, if you're a woman--the Abs Diet is written for men first, although it's great for women.  Just decrease the portion size, remember) and-- only if you're truly really dedicated and fairly fit to begin with, The Ultimate New York Body Plan.n, which is definitely reasonable for a moderately active woman.

For gosh sakes! We are already READING the book, can't you save the advertising for someplace else?  In addition, the author bashes every other diet he can think of--with the exception of Body for Life (which has nothing he can bash, so he ignored it).  No need for that.  I'd rather read what's good about THIS and why we need the certain things he touts, rather than read about how bad these other diets are.  As we know, Atkins works for a lot of people.<br /><br />The Abs Diet is one of the only books I know about that is pretty much exclusively for men.  A lot of women, however, have found this book to be right for them, too.  With this in mind, I wish the author would have specified the fact that women really need smaller portion sizes than men and less calories, as well.  This is a criticism I really believe is well-founded.  I haven't read the updated version that was exclusively sold by Rodale yet. Maybe that information is in there.<br /><br />The Abs Diet is founded on solid and current information. It's important to eat approximately every three hours so that our metabolism is at optimal speed.  When we do not eat and skip snacks, not only are we more likely to feel we're \\"starving\\", and overeat later, our bodies are also more likely to go into starvation mode--and begin to burn muscle for fuel. . . a state we want to avoid.<br /><br />The author explains how our body utilizes different foods (although I thought the acronym made out of ABS DIET (something else, I forgot), was not useful for me), how our body responds to exercise and rest and how to go about beginning this program.<br /><br />It's an entertaining read, as well, and the recipes are pretty tasty!	2005-05-10

The Other Boleyn girl tells the story of Mary, King Henry the VIII's mistress before he met and married Mary's sister, the more well-known Ann.<br /><br />This is a great story, beautifully written and completely interesting from beginning to end.  Written from Mary's point of view, the story elaborates on the theme that both Mary and Ann were pawns in the Boleyn family's push for upward mobility.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by Philippa Gregory, and I am looking forward to receiving The Queen's Fool so that I may read that, as well.  There are events in her novel, however, that some historians do not believe occurred.  For instance, in this book, Henry fathers Mary's first two children while she was married to (but living separately from) her husband.  Some historians dispute this allegation and believe that Mary was the king's mistress prior to her marriage and that her children were the offspring of both Mary and her husband--and concieved very much after the affair ended.  Regardless, these are events that will most likely always be in dispute and have been, thus far, impossible to prove definitively either way.  And, Philippa Gregory chooses the option that makes for a better story and more empathetic character.  Good for her.<br /><br />This novel transports the reader through time and is difficult to put down. I also recommend The Autobiography of Henry VIII, by Margaret George, for another fictionalized first-person account of this era in British history.	2005-05-10

I have to disagree. As a woman in my late thirties, whose life couldn't be more different than Dave Eggers', I found this book to be excellent-- excruciatingly honest and a most poignant memoir.<br /><br />One can't help but feel for what the Eggers family goes through.  The reader cheers and cries from the sidelines.  I was surprised at the vehemence of my emotions when reading this.  Dave Eggers certainly drew me in to his and his family's life, and there were so many times that, as a parent, I wanted to find them all and parent them myself.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, wholeheartedly, to everyone.  People have compared Eggers to David Sedaris.  As much as I enjoyed the one Sedaris book I read, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, I would put Eggers' book on another plane entirely.  Sedaris' life is also interesting, but Dave Eggers is clearly a better writer and more honest with his emotions.	2005-05-10

I'm surprised at the negative reviews I've read regarding this book.  It seemed to me that these reviewers disliked the idea that the author really hated being fat and was unable to fully accept herself at that weight.  To me, this seems perfectly reasonable.  It's WHY she wanted to lose this weight and WHY she finally DID lose this weight. It's why ALL dieting people lose the weight. They dislike fat.  Aesthetically, many people find obesity unattractive. Although one may not like this fact of life, it IS indeed a fact of life.  Furthermore, for some, obesity epitomizes the idea of indulgence and a lack of caring of themselves.<br /><br />I found this memoir to be particularly touching.  Frances is brutally honest when she recalls how she used to sneak food, and lots of it, as a child.  She recalls the pain she felt being fat, how she knew she was considered and judged-- fairly or not.<br /><br />What I found most interesting of all is how Frances had to learn behaviors that most women take for granted.  As preteens and teens, we learn to flirt, to make ourselves attractive to the opposite sex, to talk to others, to dress, to put on makeup, etc.  We learn how to attract attention from others, to meet potential dates, mates, etc.  All this is natural for most of us.<br /><br />For Frances, however, none of this was a natural progression.  As an obese adolescent who never felt attractive, she never learned how to flirt because she never felt as if she was attractive enough to meet others. One of the negative reviewers stated derisively that Frances referred to herself as a girl.  I didn't make that distinction when I read the book, but it's only fitting. She missed a normal girlhood-- the makeup, the hair, the sleepovers with girls where you giggle about boys and sex.  All of this was foreign to Frances.  And, she was never treated as a cute little girl or \\"an attractive woman\\" growing up.  So, when she was all of a sudden thrust into the world of being considered attractive, of having people respond to her as if she was an attractive woman, she had to learn all of the behaviors that most of us just learned from living.<br /><br />I have a family member who is the author's former size.

And, then, lo and behold, I discovered that we were going to be welcoming baby number three into the world! Completely unexpected, and a little older than before, I was terrified I would gain a lot of weight.  I managed to keep the weightgain down, but still, after the birth of my happy little surprise, I had 25 pounds to lose and was anxious to get it off.<br /><br />The truth was I didn't know the truth about eating and the truth about exercising. I had never lifted weights and was no longer as physically active as I once was.  I bought the Firm and the stick thing that went with it, but the information that program came with didn't go into the whys and the ways. So, even though there was some instruction, and a calendar, I didn't understand about the physiology of eating properly and often and how one must let their muscles rest after exercising.<br /><br />Bill Phillips' book was the perfect introduction for me.  In twelve weeks, just as promised, I was back to my smaller size.  And, I learned so much about weight loss and proper nutrition and working out with weights and how to improve my aerobic/cardio routine, as well.  His book completely whet my appetite for more knowledge regarding proper eating/dieting/nutrition/etc., and because of Body for Life, I have read so much more about nutrition and exercise and this is now a full-fledged interest of mine.<br /><br />The only criticism I have now, two years after I have read it and several years after publication, is that it really needs to be updated. The current thought is that one must eat immediately after working out. Body for Life states you should wait an hour.  Also, the Body for Life website, which he refers to and recommends throughout his book, is now owned and operated by EAS, a food supplement company, not Bill Phillips, as it used to be.<br /><br />I'd really like to see something new by Bill Phillips. He's an inspiration.it used to be.  <br /> <br />I'd really like to see something new by Bill Phillips. He's an inspiration.	2005-05-10

Excellently written, Disneywar is exciting from start to finish.<br /><br />I wonder, as some of the other reviewers, why Michael Eisner gave James B. Stewart such access.  It's true he's not painted in the most flattering light. However, it's also true-- I think-- that Eisner IS an empathetic character.  Ironically, although he comes off a bit megalomaniacal, he also truly believed his way was the best way for this company.<br /><br />Stewart did his homework.  He shares more than enough background so that every event we read has a clear context. Not a book about Walt, we learn more about him as well as the other executives that brought Disney to where it is today.  Stewart's book is really a masterpiece and, although many companies' inner workings would be fascinating to read about, the fact that this is the Walt Disney company we're reading about makes it just that much more exciting.<br /><br />This is a great book and, with its weighty size, would also make a great gift for any Disney or business fan.	2005-05-09
US	27992471	R3BFP830GC1Z73	0785261036	5934911	The Third Terrorist: The Middle East Connection to the Oklahoma City Bombing	Books	5	11	19	N	Y	should be required reading	If ever there was proof of bias in the mainstream media, the fact that this book was published and has received so little, if any, media attention, is it.<br /><br />Jayna Davis-- a very credible investigative reporter-- has unearthed an abundance of evidence regarding the connection of Timothy McVeigh (and Terry Nichols) and Muslim extremists with the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing.<br /><br />She cites all her sources and is THOROUGH.  Regarding the reviewers who may have implied that she and/or her sources are questionable-- well, that's just not true.  Although this book didn't receive nearly enough press, Jayna Davis' information has NEVER been discredited.  On the contrary, it has been dismissed out of hand, without reasonable discourse and intelligent discussion.<br /><br />Why was the information in this book kept mum by the Clinton Administration? Davis doesn't answer this question.  However, considering the lack of action on the part of the Clinton Administration whenever there was an attack on our interests by Islamic terrorists overseas, it seems that Clinton didn't want to face the terrorist threat-- he wanted to leave it for another administration (which, of course, he did).  Had this information been released to the public at the time Timothy McVeigh was captured, Clinton would have been faced with the dilemma of actually DOING something when it came to terrorism.  For Clinton, it was much easier to solely blame fringe extreme right-wing lunatic(s) for this heinous crime, rather than lose much of his political base by holding Muslim extremists also responsible.  Is this one of the reasons McVeigh remained largely silent?<br /><br />This book is, sadly, an eye opener.  We are better off facing our enemies than denying they are as dangerous as they are.	2005-05-09

I have recommended it to so many people.  Rabbi Lapin is an observant Jew who explains why, as Jews, we should be supportive of the Evangelical Christian political viewpoint rather than fear it as Jews have done (I believe) for years.  He argues that it's not Jews that Christians dislike (which many Jews believe (falsely). . . I can personally attest to this), but that it's liberals they dislike. . . with reason.<br /><br />Rabbi Lapin explains that Jews and Christians share a Judeo-Christian value system which is threatened by liberal secularism.  And, considering his convincing arguments and examples, one can only agree with this conclusion after reading this interesting and well-written book.<br /><br />Jews and Christians raise their families in much the same way.  Although our theologies differ, our value system is almost identical.  Personally, I think, as Jews, we'd be better served if we could honestly recognize who our real friends are.  Rabbi Daniel Lapin makes it perfectly clear who they are and who our real enemies are.  Unfortunately, I think most Jews-- including my own relatives-- don't understand the truth of this yet.<br /><br />I'd like to see this book rereleased and updated to include the last two elections and 9-11.	2005-05-09

I'm not a big fan of \\"chick-lit\\" as a genre, but this book--as well as Sophie Kinsella's other books-- is truly one of the funniest books I've ever read.  I couldn't put it down and I immediately purchased her other books, as well.<br /><br />Rebecca, the heroine, is just hilarious-- justifying her purchases, alternatively ignoring and rueing the financial dilemma she creates for herself.  One doesn't have to be in the same economic predicament Rebecca is in to relate to her.  A fun, fun read.	2005-05-09

From start to finish, The Time Traveler's Wife was so incredibly moving and well-crafted, I couldn't put it down-- which was a shame, because I finished it too soon and truly did not want to put the book away.	2005-05-08
US	27992471	R3HOPDEI1SY3PO	0060730315	72001534	Cassandra French's Finishing School for Boys: A Novel	Books	4	3	5	N	Y	worked for me!	I definitely understand the disappointment many of these reviewers felt.  My thoughts? Lighten up!!! I found Garcia's book absolutely hilarious.  Not at all like his Rex series (which I also loved), Finishing School is unlike most other novels.<br /><br />I think the title and cover may have surprised the disappointed readers here.  Finishing School is marketed with the Chick-Lit-type cover, yet it's nothing like Sophie Kinsella (who I adore).  This is dark, but not American Psycho-dark (well, I shamefully appreciated that, too, for what it was at the time). Finishing School is black humor--but it's black humor laced with light humor.<br /><br />The heroine of this book is missing her moral compass. Still, she's interesting, funny, and strange.  She IS offensive, but the book is not. The book doesn't advocate doing the things Cassandra French does. It tells the story of someone who does do these things. In that sense, it's funny.	2005-05-08

When I discovered The Memoirs of Cleopatra, I was a tad disappointed.  Nevertheless, I happily bought the book assuming that it would be as interesting and fun to read as those other two.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong!  This tome was so horribly uninteresting, I was never able to finish it and it still sits only half-read on my bookshelves.  Sometimes, I think of tackling it again, but everytime I read the first several pages, I wind up putting it back down.	2005-05-08
US	27992471	RDQ2W53WGOECM	0312194390	627904901	The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes by His Fool, Will Somers: A Novel	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Excellent--almost 5 stars	I first read this book when it originally was published and absolutely loved it.  In fact, I recommended it to everyone I knew.  I don't remember how I came upon it, but I was fascinated with the idea of learning more about Henry VIII in an entertaining way such as this.<br /><br />The length of this book is what makes it so much fun. Often when I find a good book, it's over way too soon. Not so with The Autobiography of Henry VIII.  Additionally, I didn't know much about this King except what everyone knows--that he had two of his wives killed and that he was not an empathetic character.<br /><br />Not true. Being able to see things (albeit, this is fiction) from his point of view made him very empathetic.  And, I learned that the people loved this King for much of his reign.<br /><br />Margaret George's story made this era so interesting for me, that I have since read many more novels and nonfiction books on the subject.  Now that I have read much more on the subject, I realize that the author was not entirely accurate and that much of what she used in her novel has been found to be false by many other historians.  Still, I heartily recommend The Autobiography of Henry VIII since it's entirely entertaining and such a good introduction to this time period.<br /><br />Read this first, and then read Mary, Queen of Scots.  They are both so enjoyable and so meaty, you will not be disappointed.  I do not recommend The Memoirs of Cleopatra, however-- it's been sitting half-read on my bookshelves since it came out, and was not nearly as entertaining as these two.	2005-05-08
US	27992471	RSCY7GR684FYD	0060256753	217909928	Lafcadio, The Lion Who Shot Back	Books	5	48	51	N	N	wow!	I hadn't heard of this book until a few years ago, when I came upon it and read a few pages in the bookstore.  WOW!!! Although I appreciate Shel Silverstein's other stories and poems, nothing at all is like this one.  And, that's a disappointment, because after reading this one to my children, we wanted MORE.<br /><br />In my kids' schools, the Giving Tree was always considered such a classic, and praised as such.  Lafcadio? Never mentioned! How disappointing, and oh, what those students are missing.  Lafcadio isn't even in the school's library catalogue!<br /><br />Lafcadio tells the story of a lion who comes to the city and becomes a gentleman--losing his lionly ways.  But, Shel Silverstein tells this story so hilariously, I can barely read it aloud without laughing hysterically.  I used to read this to my son, and literally could not get the words out without laughing uncontrollably.  This, of course, caused my son to laugh as heartily without even knowing why. . . begging me to stop laughing and to tell him what was so funny.  Lafcadio is an experience, that's for sure!<br /><br />That said, this isn't a completely gentle book. It's probably the only book I've read to the kids that talked about eating people--and, made eating people funny.  However, the unexpected quirkiness of the story is also what made it so hilarious.  This is really a classic.  Your kids will love it and you will love it.	2005-05-08
US	27992471	ROY390F3JI9ES	0394585380	461103067	The Wives of Henry VIII	Books	4	5	5	N	N	thorough and thoroughly engaging	Antonia Frazer makes history alive and completely interesting. This book separates fact from fiction regarding the Wives of King Henry VIII.  There are many pieces of information regarding Henry and his wives that historians disagree upon. Frazer discusses WHY she came to the conclusions she did and discusses the alternative viewpoints of other historians.  This detail in particular really impressed me.  (Of course, it was a little disappointing, however, to discover that Katherine Howard didn't actually cry out her love for Thomas Culpepper from the scaffold, though!)<br /><br />This book provides more than a brief overview to all six of these fascinating women.  It really discusses their lives--as related to Henry and to the times-- in much detail, covering many important points while clarifying misconceptions and legend from fact.	2005-05-08

I purchased this book for my 8 yr. old son at our local school's book fair. Beautiful design, loads of information, the name \\"scholastic\\" on the cover. . . seemed perfect.  Imagine my dismay when I came home and got a chance to actually read some of the entries--notably George W. Bush.  Is David Rubel a member of Moveon.org? Of the DNC? Was he Howard Dean's speechwriter?<br /><br />This author was COMPLETELY biased and it is definitely NOT an \\"encyclopedia\\"-- despite its claim to the contrary.  Encyclopedias are supposed to be unbiased. Children's books, especially, are not supposed to reek of bias.  David Rubel makes it clear that GWB is reviled--deservedly so--by everyone.  His entry on Bush clearly shows us his own personal views. He believes that only religious Christians support Bush, that Bush divided this country, that Bush only sees one side of every issue, and that he has angered the country by siding against stem cell research, pulling out of Kyoto, and the International Criminal Court. There's much more. As a matter of fact, there isn't ONE positive comment attributed to Bush, and there is a whole lot of negative \\"spin\\".  Scholastic ought to be ashamed of themselves for passing this off as an encyclopedia and might want to consider repackaging this book as \\"The Liberals Take on our US Presidents and Their Times\\".<br /><br />Yes, there is clearly bias regarding some of the other entries, as well. But, the Bush entry is clearly the absolute worst.  I'm just saddened to know that, unfortunately, many children will find this book in their school's library and use it as reference material.	2005-03-06
