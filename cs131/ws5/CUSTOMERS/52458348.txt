Hart understandably frames Monroe's career around the idea of him as the nation's first national security president, and most of the book deals with the Monroe Doctrine.  <br />This is good, but it does so to the deteriment of virtually every other issue during the Monroe Administration, including a very cursory mention of the Missouri Compromise. This is one of the book's weaknesses. <br />Hart also can't resist a cheap shot at the Bush Administration, taking it to task for projecting the Monroe Doctrine worldwide via the War on Terror/Iraq. A very cogent argument, except that the Monroe Doctrine was never mentioned as justification for Bush's military moves, and Hart earlier in the book says that Monroe believed in vigorous projection of American power in the service of democratic ideals. One senses Hart's discomfort would not be shared by Monroe.  <br />This series continues to be very enjoyable, and this is a worthy addition.	2005-09-28

This is an honest-to-God biography of a living, breathing human being, and makes one understand why there might be a legend, or why one should want there to be one.

Sandwiched inbetween pages dealing with the eruption in 79 AD are digressions on geology, astronomy, Roman history and dozens of other subjects. I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to come away impressed with the author or the connections in history and life. I am sure of one thing - for an agnostic, the author sure does talk a lot about Christianity. And though he tries very hard to mix it up with Gnosticism, it doesn't quite come off. I can't decide whether this is a subconscious longing for what he perceives as religious peace and certainty, or an effort to rebut something tugging at his heart. <br />I would have enjoyed the book a lot more if I had gotten less of the author and more of the subject it was supposed to have been about. When he stuck to the subject, he was brilliant. But the author's anguish over the 9/11 terrorist attacks was fodder for another, equally brilliant book. Just not this one. He did remind me of one thing that is worth repeating - just because time elapses does not dim the tragedy of history. For a moment, I felt the anguish of the people in Pompeii, the Titanic and the World Trade Center, and that's what saves this book.	2005-08-16

I don't want to slam Mr. DeFord. He's obviously a very gifted writer and has made his career. But I was very disappointed in this book. I can only say that I feel a deep connection with both Mathewson and McGraw that this book did not satisfy. It basically reads like what it is - an expanded magazine article with lots of useless color thrown in and nothing substantive about Christy Mathewson or John McGraw that I haven't read any other place. I was hoping for some flesh and blood instead of a bunch of second or third-hand recollections. These men led hard lives with dignity and rage, honor and humiliation, and those vivid tones are only hinted at here. And DeFord's style is too-clever-by-half, enamored with his word play and forgetting to give me the meat. A lesser writer could have done this without injecting so much of his precious infatuation with the quaint language of turn of the century America. As I said, nothing against Mr. DeFord. I guess I was hoping for a deeper, different book.	2005-04-18

But I was disappointed by the fact that not all of the essays accompanying songs are about the songs as much as the interpretations of the individual writers about what the songs mean to them. Frankly, I wasn't interested in that, just as I'm not interested in how these songs remind people of how much they hate George W. Bush or the political right. The irony is that these songs are, in effect, red state songs, if you want to look it from a completely superficial standpoint. But these songs speak to everybody, and always have. Tying political points to them drags down the appreciation one feels. I especially enjoyed it when the essays went into the particular events behind the songs, or in the case of \\"El Paso,\\" how the song was written and recorded. Perhaps what I wanted was another version of \\"Stagolee Shot Billy,\\" a wonderful study of the Stagger Lee mythos. I would recommend this book to anyone, even with those reservations.	2004-12-28

I can now see why. You can even look at it as indicative of the humanity that exists at the bottom of all political arguments - \\"even someone I strongly disagree with is still a person.\\" True, Bush won the election. True, the worldview represented by the would-be assassin illustrates what it feels like to be on the wrong side of history.

That's the only explanation I have for why Mordred, Walter O'Dim and The Crimson King basically become phantoms that can be easily dispatched after volumes (literally) of set up and dread. Mordred kills the Man in Black rather easily, but then Mordred himself is dispatched effortlessly by Roland. And then The Crimson King turns out to be this antic Santa Claus who, by himself, just lobs explosives at the Gunslinger until he's done in by magic. This is the same Crimson King who we've been angling to see for seven books now, who has armies marching at his will, has all these appendages of evil who work for him, and yet he's this crank yelling from the battlements of the tower. As for the characters themselves, the death of Eddie was very effective, as was Jake's. And Susannah left as I expected her to. I had no problems with King inserting himself into the mix. The ending, which others seem disappointed with, felt right to me. As with Books IV through VII, I can say that I think all of them (except for VI) were about 200 pages too long. In order of quality, I would rank them 1. The Waste Lands 2. The Drawing of the Three. 3. Wolves of the Calla. 4. The Song of Susannah 5. The Gunslinger. 6. The Dark Tower. 7. Wizard and Glass. I enjoyed the series, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't slightly let me down, which might be just emotion at arriving at the end.	2004-10-04

As a fan of &quot;Best of the Web,&quot; I couldn't wait to read this book and I was not disappointed. Some very good essays about the Presidents, and also the end sections on Presidential Leadership with the economy, foreign affairs and other specialized issues. My knock on this book would be the aforementioned sections on JFK and FDR, which dwell on their foibles and not enough on their achievements. But as I said, it's the Wall Street Journal? Did you expect canonization? To be fair, the two get their due in the other sections dealing with the Presidency overall. I would say that because each president gets an individual bio, the results are sometimes disappointing. Particularly Madison, which dwells exclusively on his formulation of the Constitution and leaves one paragraph for his presidency, which included the War of 1812. The Nixon section has some good points about whether Nixon actually displayed leadership (albeit tardy) in resigning, though I learned more about Nixon's economic policy and its disastrous effects than I ever learned in many biographies of the man. The Clinton section practically glows with animus. But these examinations are occasionally too specialized where I was hoping for a broader overview. Still a great book.	2004-07-06

You'll also get the raw emotion in his voice when he spits out the sections about Kenneth Starr. And even better, you'll have someone to yell at when you realize how he much he left out to justify his actions. It's interesting that he delves into the Lewinsky saga only at the moment the public found out about it. To have done it chronologically would have spoiled the moment of his \\"triumph\\" against Gingrich and the Republicans. By doing it this way, he continue to portray himself as more sinned against than sinning, a man who could have led America to the promised land if only those Republicans hadn't been as fascistic as they apparently are. Is it worth reading? Depends on what your definition of \\"is\\" is.	2004-06-24

She offers an interesting diversion from other studies, in that Buchanan tried to be a strong chief executive, but failed because he chose to swim against the tide of public opinion by being so closely aligned with the South. It's hard to argue with this.<BR>Where I would diverge is in her thesis - stated several times through the book - that Buchanan was a stubborn, ideologically driven president and that is why he failed. I would say that while this is certainly right, it is not a truism that all stubborn, ideologically driven presidents are failures. We need only look at Mr. Buchanan's successor. (Actually, this conclusion might pass except that it sounds oddly like criticism of the current president, on whom the jury is still out)<BR>But seriously, I think Buchanan suffered as a stubborn, ideologically driven president because he did not realize that his time had passed. The nation could not be driven back into wholehearted support for slavery in every quarter of the land. Buchanan's arrogance in assuming he could &quot;make&quot; the nation do that is a failure of leadership, but that does not mean that presidents are not capable of forcing their own version of the world onto it. As Garry Wills reminded us, Lincoln pretty much remade the national self image at Gettysburg by marrying the nation to the Declaration of Independence, instead of the Constitution that brought about the war. <BR>Buchanan comes off as a tragic figure, as he should. This book is as enjoyable as it is instructive.	2004-05-28

This volume is an improvement over his similar work on Dwight Eisenhower for Times Books' American Presidents series. That volume suffered from an overabundance of journalism and not enough scholarship, in that Wicker took his newsman's ideas about Eisenhower (which really hadn't changed in the last 50 years) and imposed them on his work. One expected to hear the Adlai Stevenson jingle playing in the background.<br />His biography of GHW Bush is better in this regard, but suffers from some of the same flaws. For example, you'll never convince Tom Wicker that Reagan was anything other than an idiot that Bush more or less suffered nobly for eight years (along with the rest of the nation which inexplicably kept electing him). And Wicker will have none of this foolishness that it was the defense buildup of the eighties that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Curiously, he gives no alternate explanation for this, I guess because it couldn't possibly have been attributable to Reagan's leadership (or Bush's for that matter). <br />He gives ample praise to Bush for the coalition he built for Gulf War I, though it does come off as backhanded, since he might be insinuating that the father outdid the son in this regard when it came to Gulf War II. And a good portion of the book is spent reliving the debacle of the 1992 election, which has Wicker excoriating Bush for miscues that were later duplicated during the Clinton Administration, but I guess were okay then. For example, it's too bad that Bush stooped to low tactics in regard to Willie Horton and campaigning against Clinton's supposed character flaws, but Clinton's routine lies about himself and Bush were apparently fair game since they aren't mentioned.<br />The point of this review is not to say this is a bad book. It is as fair an assessment of the first Bush presidency as you are likely to get from the former Timesman. It might even be characterized as admirable given the outright lies that are being told about the Bushes in order to keep a dynasty from flourishing. It should be noted, though, that the reader can sense Wicker trying to be &quot;fair&quot; with Bush, and it feels awkward. While this is by no means a hatchet job, its tone at times is at times gratingly patronizing. <br />But, it's better than you could have expected from, say, Anthony Lewis.	2004-05-03

We're right to fight against Islam, just not the way we're doing it? We should reason with them while we kill them? They're beyond reason and want us dead, but we should at least articulate our message?<br />This is a good book, in that it examines Islamofascism and realizes that something has to be done about it. But it doesn't go far enough out of its inordinate dislike of the Bush Administration. The author seems to be saying that we at least need someone more palatable to liberals to make the case that this war on Terrorism needs to be fought. How noble.<br />I can see his point, but I disagree. The hard left will always be opposed to war, and much of this book's reasoning seems to be an intellectual way to get the left on board. I.E. We can support the war as long as \\"we're waging it,\\" that is, we being liberalism. But he spends part of the book showing how liberals are incapable of recognizing threats, much less responding to them. Lots of luck.<br />I doubt there is a liberal alive who could have accomplished the defeat of Iraq the way George W. Bush has, with as little loss of life on our side. Let me put it this way, this book has a rather petty point. As far as the Islamic world is concerned, I don't care if they're mad at us. I want them to fear us. Then maybe they'll leave us alone.	2003-04-09

Bush and the Southern Takeover of American Politics	Books	2	13	44	N	N	Polemic, self hatred in the service of politics	This book tells us a lot more about Michael Lind that it does about George W. Bush. I gleaned a few things from it about the author, who feels that:<BR>1. All religious conservatives, no matter their personality or values, are bigots who are morally bankrupt.<BR>2. Except for the tiny corner of Texas where Lind grew up, the whole state is one big waste of hemoglobin, a land of bigots, big oilmen and bible thumpers who enjoy beating up black people and starving children.<BR>3. If someone does have an active, non-civic faith, they are a religious fanatic and therefore a threat to the republic.<br />Now, I'm sure that those who have read this book might feel this is an exaggeration, but this book itself exaggerates. It begins with the premise (similar to the columns of Paul Krugman) that Dubya isn't a political adversary who must be opposed, but an evil force of history who must be repudiated and stopped at all costs. There is no middle ground. He not only represents the interests of the Republican Party, but all the evils of those who have opposed \\"us\\" since the dawn of time. In making this case, Lind pushes points to their Nth degree in order to make Bush seem more extreme and more dangerous and thus show why he must be wiped from the pages of American history. This makes fine reading for the \\"Gore Wuz Robbed\\" crowd, but the rest of the country need only look at the president to see how skewed this portrait is.<br />I couldn't help but be amused by one thing. Lind says that Southern fundamentalist culture is incapable of producing intellectuals. Well, tell that to our former president and his vice-president. Both Clinton and Gore, \\"progressive and open-minded thinkers\\" that they are, are Southern Baptists. Never mind the yes, but... yes, but... that I hear coalescing out there. It's undeniable.

I don't agree with either of their political messages, but they are perfect movies, dramatically, stylistically, and visually.<br />This book is okay, except for several typos, sloppy sentence construction, and the almost single-minded obsessions (for example, all Republicans are bad, except those that agree with the author - not wrong, but bad, evil). There's no air to breath!<br />This pops up too with the Kennedy assassination, where in the author's world, there simply has to be a conspiracy because of the symbolic nature of the killing. Never mind those inconvenient facts against a conspiracy that get in the way and those elusive \\"facts\\" that confirm a conspiracy which never can quite be confirmed themselves. <br />Also, the reasoning behind some of these arguments, frankly, is nonexistent. Too many times Hamburg seems to be saying that if someone disagrees with his interpretation of the facts, they must have some ulterior motive. The conspiracy, apparently, gets bigger with each dissenting voice to it. Reminds me of Umberto Eco's \\"Focault's Pendulum.\\"<br />This book is entertaining for what it says about both Washington and Hollywood. But it's not very deep and slightly disappointing because it doesn't aim a little higher and work a little harder. It also paints a scary picture when one considers that, contrary to Oliver Stone's protestations, most people get their history from the movies, not from the actual sources.  <br />I guess I can take Oliver Stone better than an apologist. At least, I don't expect him to make sense, just movies.	2003-02-12

Eisenhower	Books	2	9	14	N	N	For God's sake, get over it	Tom Wicker begins this book by informing us that in 1956, as a working journalist, he took up a newsroom collection for Eisenhower's opponent in the fall election, Adlai Stevenson. Despite that [amt]donation, Eisenhower somehow duped the rest of the country into voting for him.<BR>In short, that's the gist of this book, Wicker's attempt some 50 years later to explain why he didn't vote for Eisenhower. He succeeds in dragging in for the book's 150 pages every liberal interpretation of the Eisenhower record while ignoring all of its highpoints. Wicker whines that Ike is not strong enough on civil rights, he unleashed the CIA, he began the long descent into Vietnam, he did not challenge McCarthy, he did not sign a nuclear test ban treaty. Blah blah blah. In short, he was a doddering old man who was shallow in comparison with the Kennedys and largely a caretaker president. While Wicker takes occasional swipes at being objective, his criticisms of Eisenhower do not take into account hindsight nor the large amount of revisionist Eisenhower scholarship. To read this book, one would assume that detente was still possible and that managing the Cold War to stalemate during its hottest years was nothing to write home about. For Wicker, it's 1960 all over again, and JFK will ride to the rescue. <br />There are some good observations of Eisenhower in person that are worth buying the book for, the sort of touches that one would expect from a journalist who had actually met the man. But Wicker also drags in that \\"His preferred reading was western novels\\" and that \\"His painting was strictly a hobby, with no concern for art. He objected to a Picasso hanging in Gabriel Hauge's White House Office, disliked classical music..\\" and other mortal sins. This sort of thing stands out because it reads like a typical argument against Eisenwhower in 1956: \\"Well,you know, Stevenson is so much more eloquent.\\"	2002-10-20

Franzen's strongest pieces are his self-portraits, in relation to his art. They reveal a lot about his view of successful fiction, as it translates into artistic expression and the ability to encapsulate time and place. But when I say &quot;dated,&quot; I mean how early 90s most of the pieces read in their self-absorption, hand-wringing and whining sensibilities. Some of the thinking is positively Clintonian in its construction. At times, Franzen seems to mistake conventional wisdom with &quot;wisdom,&quot; which dates these pieces. When he drags politics in, (though mercifully, in small doses) we get to see just how vaporous some of our concerns of the last decade as a nation have been. When he really soars, as he often does, he is offering a window into his own life through recording the slow deterioration of his father and his attempts to make sense of it. His ideas on systems are noteworthy, but I found myself wondering what he would have made of them from a fictional standpoint. Still, this book is worth reading for Franzen's wit, which is considerable, and his sense of hope, which is valuable.	2002-10-03

Bush that is intriguing, because it only briefly touches on his biography and gives us the essense of the man day-to-day. While it confirms some criticisms, it shows the superficiality of stereotypes surrounding the man, presenting a much deeper picture. It also shows the nature of journalism during an election year, and presents the public with an inside look at how candidates interact with the reporters, how personal they get or can get, and how that translates in the day-to-day coverage. Bruni shows the shortcomings of this system, as well as its virtues.

I am also not Catholic. But this book is not about John XXIII. It's about Thomas Cahill writing a 200-page history of the Catholic Church and saying why he doesn't like Pope John Paul II. It's a similar trick used by John Cornwall in his book Hitler's Pope. Thomas Cahill is a wonderful writer, and he condenses and popularizes history better than anyone going. But let's be honest; this can be summed up in the comment Cahill relates from a Jesuit that the Catholic Church has been set back some 200 years by John Paul's pontificate. That admission comes in the final chapter, and it speaks volumes about how the life of a godly man has been used, painted in broad and vague brushstrokes, simply to promulgate someone's \\"enlightened view\\" of how others should worship.	2002-01-24

You get a voice telling  you a story about real people, and you can feel the wind in the trees and  hear the passing cars on the streets where the people were born.<br />These  people exist, something that is not always possible to discern in a  newspaper report. And if a reporter is best when there is a little of every  man in him, then Rick Bragg speaks with a voice that is the same as the  people in the stories he tells. Enjoy.	2000-05-09

First off, those who read this book have probably already madeup their minds not to vote for Dubya. This is simply reenforcement,and it is the kind of thing you would expect from Molly Ivins. It's humorous, spirited prose which lacerates Bush at turns and pays him backhanded compliments for the purpose of seeming openminded.<br />From a factual standpoint, readers who come to this work should note there is no index, no notes section, and a heavy reliance at critical points on unnamed sources for pithy quotes. This keeps the book concise, easy to read, and untroubled by any challenge to its veracity. It implicates Bush by association in the suicide of a Texas prisoner, and misquotes his views on liberal opposition to the Vietnam War as somehow indicative of his &quot;blue blood detachment&quot; from the problems of &quot;real Americans.&quot; <br />It should also be noted that despite the hue and cry that Bush's ascendancy to the Presidency might be the worst thing to happen to Americans since Milli Vanilli, Ivins cannot resist drawing parallels with the embattled Clinton Administration, whether it be Whitewater, cattle futures, or what have you. And therein lies the book's fatal flaw, from an objective standpoint. For eight years, Ivins and others have sold us the line that none of the very real ethical problems the Clintons have thrown us have been problems. Therefore, if they weren't troubled by a Southern governor with an inflated record and a penchant for abusive behavior toward women, they shouldn't be all that concerned with what they perceive is a Southern governor with an inflated record and a penchant for evangelical Christianity.<br />So is Bush a threat? It depends on what you're definition of &quot;is&quot; is.	2000-04-26

Impressed on  that knowledge is the memory that Professor Wills endorsed our recently  impeached president in his initial run for the White House.<br />That aside,  Wills presents his well-intentioned points in the clear, precise prose one  has come to expect from him over the years. Unfortunately, in making his  case, he sets up a number of straw men in the guise of opposing arguments,  at times buttressing his opposition's claims with information he feels  makes his point. For example, in proving that revolutionary militiamen did  not have the free access to guns that is popularly supposed, he  inadvertantly makes a point for the other side: That American distrust of  bureaucracy and elite government predates the Constitution, a point he is  trying to rebut.<br />What is more, his ideological stripe turns up, though I  know his intention was to let it lie dormant. But associating Eric Robert  Rudolph with Newt Gingrich, anti-abortion terrorists with Ronald Reagan,  and making snide comments about term-limit advocates does not exactly  endear one to his point of view. It only drives home the impression that  Mr. Wills book is not meant to convince the other side as much as ridicule  it. <br />That does not mean his book is without merit. It simply means it is  a disappointingly one-sided work which had much more promise. One wonders  why Professor Wills does not feel that American history is as open to  interpretation for conservative advocates as it has long been for liberals.	1999-12-31
US	52458348	RXG032SAN3TF4	0684852624	378132672	Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Very good overview of Independent Counsel Law	Though some reviewers have disparaged the device, Woodward's work in tracing the Independent Counsel Law through five presidents is well done, if not deep or scholarly. He shows how the law spun out of control, yet  typically does not place the blame where it lies, in a generation of  post-Watergate legislators determined to undo the excesses they perceived  were inherent in the system. It was this sort of sanctimony which spawned  the partisan infighting from which the nation still suffers to this  day.<br />This failure is consistent with Woodward's style. He is quick to  point fingers in the direction of Jimmy Carter and George Bush for excesses  in their managerial style, yet he refrains from making judgments during the  Reagan Administration regarding the former president's conduct during  Iran-Contra. This choice of offering analysis at some moments and  refraining from it at others is exasperating, as evidenced when the book  moves to the Clinton section, which consumes more than the second half of  the narrative. One interesting and enjoyable facet is the continuing  appearance of Richard Nixon in each presidency, not only as a shadow of  illegal activity but also as a dark angel of reconciliation.<br />It is in the  most recent section that Woodward makes a compelling, if not altogether  believeable case, that most of the mystery which drove Whitewater was the  distrust and subterfuge of a paranoid White House. Yet he withholds  judgements on the multiple conflicts of interest and questionable practices  of that same White House which made the investigations necessary.<br />The  book also omits important moments from the narrative for suspect reasons.  At one moment, the 1998 mid-term elections seem to scotch impeachment; the  next, Kenneth Starr is ready to testify. Woodwood omits a critical moment,  when the White House overplayed its hand and gave insulting and patently  absurd answers to the series of interrogatories posted by the Judiciary  Committee following the election. It was this, more than anything, which  drove the vote to impeach. This ommission is so conspicious that one  wonders if it was intentional. <br />&quot;Shadow&quot; does avoid the trap  that many fell into, in condemning the impeachment as a partisan witchhunt.  Indeed, Woodward shows how very close Clinton was to losing not only his  presidency, but his staff and his party. <br />Woodward's book, in short, is a  good attempt at an overview, though it suffers from obvious haste and  Woodward's usual practice of shading the facts to suit a suspect  perception. Still, it is a must for any student of the scandal culture of  Washington, and an indespensible guide to sorting out the truth behind  &quot;the politics of personal destruction.&quot;	1999-12-22
US	52458348	R3KKMC8P2IZ0TC	0670886939	928300055	Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII	Books	2	116	149	N	N	From a Protestant perspective, this book is unfair	You have to read 370 pages into this book to get to the crux of the matter, Cornwell's real aim:<br />&quot;Those who long for the realization of  collegiality in the Catholic church may also come to accept, in the light  of this narrative ... that papal autocracy, carried to the extreme, can  only demoralize and weaken Christian communities. ... It has been the  urgent thesis of this book, however, that when the papacy waxes strong at  the expense of the people of God, the Catholic Church declines in moral and  spiritual influence to the detriment of us all.&quot;<br />I have no illusions  about the power of the Papacy to inflict harm needlessly and unconsciously  on the Christian church. I have no doubt that past popes have been  responsible for death and destruction to further their own political power.  However, I do not think Cornwell presents a credible case to damn Pius XII.  He merely presents an indictment of the papacy as a strong, reactionary,  unresponsive office badly in need of reform from his own perspective.<br />To  do this, he invokes the name of Hitler in the title, conjuring up all the  evil of history associated with that name, hoping some will rub off on the  pope. He then calls him by his Christian name, stripping him of title and  making him into a faceless bureaucrat. Finally, he associates him with  every evil of the era, from fascism to McCarthyism, hoping for some revolt  against John Paul II at the end, in a chapter which seemed hastily added on  and beside the point until you arrive at page 370, the next to last  page.<br />This is history as polemic, and not necessarily well done either.  The section dealing with Pius' death is, frankly, dispicable. Because of  the nature of the work as revealed at the end, this book calls all of its  conclusions into suspicion. If Pius stood idlely by while the Holocaust was  going on, he was no more guilty of the same moral astigmatism when  presented with a choice between communism and fascism thatmany of that era  were. One would expect a biography of FDR entitled &quot;Hitler's  President.&quot; But such a criticism would be unfair in that case, and in  this.<br />A final word on Cornwell's thesis: John Paul II has stood against  so-called reformist movements, such as liberation theology, the push to  ordain women and homosexuals, a more modern view of contraception, etc. If  one has a problem with a strong, centralized leadership standing in the way  of &quot;reform,&quot; there are plenty of denominations to choose from  besides Catholicism, a sect not known in the past for its visionary reform.  But speaking as a Protestant, frankly, Catholicism without a strong Papacy  would be ridiculous, and I think Martin Luther would agree with me.<br />And  to the reader from New Jersey: Americans don't necessarily like sugar  coated history. We just don't chase after every damned red herring thrown  to us by dubious historians ready to abandon credible history based on  their own axe-grindings.  The author and those who agree with him should  instead find a better way of pursuing Catholic reform instead of  dishonoring the memory of those unable to defend themselves.	1999-11-01

It does give a good primer on how the  scandal stories have never risen above the level of uncomfirmed rumor. One  seeking an indepth discussion of policy too, may be disappointed, as the  book is light on Bush's accomplishments as governor of Texas. But it is an  unbiased analysis of the man's life and his rise to power. I'm sure both  Bush's campaign and those running against him will have plenty of good and  bad to spread around in the next year. This is a good place to look at the  man's life.	1999-10-18

This book's weaknesses are evident: It is written from a British viewpoint, and basically takes for granted a knowledge of South African history and  geography most Americans do not possess (though they should). It also soft  pedals the problems in Mandela's relationship with Winnie, though that is  understandable. I have a feeling that not too many people could understand  it.

If you believe correctly that the  President lied and attempted to smear anyone remotely interested in what  actually happened, you will probably enjoy it. If you refuse to believe you  voted TWICE for an idiot masquerading as a world leader, then you won't  like it because it has too many unpleasant facts in it. This would also  occur with people who feel that any party bias makes someone not worth  listening to because it's taken for granted that they lie. Simply put,  Geraldo won't be picking up a copy and others probably should avoid it. As  in the end, it all depends on what your definition of &quot;is&quot; is.	1999-09-28

And I just didn't like it. It's too much of a one-note song. I'm not a conservative. I'm not a liberal. I'm just sick of idealistic people who have nothing better to do  than defend books in no danger of being burned. A book this one-sided is a  fiction, because it paints a distorted picture. Zinn himself admits it's  one sided. My problem is, that's not enough. I'm sorry, I just think he  should have been more thorough and less dogmatic. I was looking for  history, not polemic. As for those of you worried that my views with infect  those considering this book, instead of responding to us narrow-minded  people, go change the world. It's waiting for you, and I'll be happy. You  can start by not taking every negative review of your favorite book as an  attack on your worldview. Otherwise, you would realize I just might agree  with most of you on the issues. I just don't think Zinn's book contains  many answers, other than a lot of axe grinding that I think is  counterproductive. Your reviews illustrate my point. I would agree with you  if you weren't so adamant that you don't want me to. Argue one point and  you're a heretic, unworthy to turn Professor Zinn's red inked pages. You  guys are worse than Baptists. Smile, will you? For those of you who haven't  read the book, you'll probably want to read it. Any book this contested  must have something worth looking at.

I was not disappointed. This book goes to great lengths to  document every facet of the black experience in the American South, the  so-called &quot;New South.&quot; It not only shows how a people struggled  against unbelieveable injustice and violence, but endured. This must never  be forgotten. Ever. Earlier reviews which call this book  &quot;revisionist&quot;  &quot;biased&quot; or &quot;flawed&quot; seem to  have forgotten Litwack's admonition in the preface, that this book was not  meant &quot;to depict blacks only as victims or whites only as  victimizers.&quot; But it also shows an unwillingness to believe that  things of this nature could have happened in America. Unfortunately, they  did, and this book is only a beginning. It must not be viewed as a sword of  Damocles to be held over the head of every white, but as a beginning to  understanding the very real work left to be done in this country between  whites and blacks. I applaud Leon Litwack for his work.	1999-08-25

The problems with this book are  simply: 1. The section on Moses (taken from a Prince of Egypt tie-in)  simply does not fit with the rest. If he had reworked it a little, perhaps.    2. The themes that Yancey sounds in this one are virtually unchanged from  the previous two books, which isn't bad except that he virtually has  nothing new to say. You hear the same notes, and they aren't as fresh. 3.  The book lacks a certain conciseness. It's short, shorter than his other  two works that I mentioned, but it rambles a great deal. 4. Yancey promises  to fit Jesus in. And he does, in the last chapter. Simply, this book needed  a bit more editing that it didn't get. It's good, but it was bound to be a  disappointment after the previous two masterpieces.	1999-07-18

On the downside, there is much here  that needs explanation and fleshing out. There are interesting nods in  certain directions that leave the reader longing for more. And there is the  inevitable feeling that a much richer story lies just beneath the surface.  However, there are rich passages of prose in this book which are a welcome  addition to Ellison's body of work. The concept, the plot, and the route  taken to get there is full of rewards along the way.   &quot;Juneteenth&quot; is a sketch of something that could have been truly  magnificent, but is still nevertheless a fascinating look into the mind of  one of America's greatest writers.	1999-06-08

It's very well written. No one, indeed, should feel this book is in anyway one-sided. It's not that either. It's simply a very fragmented, juvenile, graffiti scrawled writing  of history typical of what we've come to expect from 60s refugees like  Professor Zinn. My favorite section chronicles the Gulf War, where Zinn  devotes more than 10 pages to a conflict which lasted less than six months,  claiming the mainstream media did little to cover the anti-war protest  movement. A careful reading of the footnotes will point out that most of  his information came from newspaper clippings. (Stand by to see how much  outrage he musters in future when chronicling the Mad Bomber Clinton in his  Lewinsky-related airstrikes.)  But such things are to expected from this  book. This is nothing more or less than an exercise in airing the dirty  laundry of a nation that everyone is aware of, then casting it in the worst  possible light so that people can feel superior for knowing how shabby  human beings can be to each other. Every nation's beginning is bloody,  horrible and disgraceful. The only difference is we have fully documented  ours. Ask Professor Zinn which other utopia he'd like to immigrate to. To  get the whole picture, read this and Paul Johnson's History of the American  People. For intelligent leftist reading, consult Christopher Hitchens.	1999-06-04

If you want historical proof of Jesus, consult another book. Crosson's job is to explain away the Jesus of faith to make it easier to ignore the central  message. A Zen-Jesus who says cute things compels no one to follow him. If  you want to believe in Jesus, consult the Gospels. Just don't compromise  for Crosson's milque-toasty Jesus who looks more at home in the  politically-correct society this book is published for than the 1st century  nation he lived in. There is no scholarship behind this study, and no  archeology to buttress his opinions. It merely begins with the assumption  that the Gospels can't possibly be telling the truth, and continues from  that point. Nothing wrong with that, but a little honesty up front would  have been refreshing.	1999-05-31

There is very little scriptural quotation to buttress Mr. Weatherhead's ideas. There seem to be several moments when he is attempting to understand God simply as he  would wish God to be, not necessarily for any Biblical reasons. There were  a few moments when I felt Mr. Weatherhead was actually reading scripture at  its exactly opposite meaning. For example, are we to assume that ultimately  God never intended Jesus to be crucified, even after thousands of years of  prophecy basically spelled out how it would happen? Didn't Jesus Himself  say he came to offer His life &quot;as a ransom for many?&quot; Also, there  is a distressing quality to see events simply as All Bad, or All Good, and  nothing inbetween. The will of God either envisions the acts as they affect  all people, or it is extremely limited in its scope. Are we to assume God's  will only affects those who believe in Him? Are we to then assume that  those who do not are outside His will and outside His reach and  understanding?  While he does have some interesting points, and his  grouping of the Will of God into three different categories is laudable, it  is difficult to agree with the conclusions he draws simply because he is so  fast in arriving at them.  While this book does a good job at comforting,  it seems to comfort with a frustrating lack of specificity.  I would  recommend this book to people who are in pain, but I would not recommend it  to those who want reliable answers as to why things happen when we cannot  understand them. Outside of the Bible itself, I would recommend the books  of Philip Yancey and C.S. Lewis. It is impossible to tackle a subject as  absolutely all-incompassing and unknowable as &quot;the Will of God&quot;  in 86 pages.	1999-05-16
