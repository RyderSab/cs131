US	45969308	R1EM8BY1ZWL79	0374129983	647099960	The Corrections	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Depressing and Draining	Like so many other Oprah Book Club books, this one will sap you of any emotional optimism and resiliency you may have built up over the last 12 months.  However, it is also well-written, insightful and allows you to see a sad, horrible situation from the many points of view that allowed it to become what it is.  It is everything you hope your family will not be.	2002-05-20
US	45969308	RKPENYVPL170A	0679728759	53277980	Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Cynical & Thought Provoking	Never one to look at the world through rose-colored glasses, McCarthy really outdoes himself here.  Written in his usual quirky syntax, McCarthy will show you a side of the wild West to which you might have preferred to remain oblivious.  He will also encourage you to consider the men, great and evil, who built this country and made it what it is today.  Finally, for me at least, it set off a new evaluation of the quality and value of life.	2002-05-20
US	45969308	R3OAVZX4S0W38	1573227331	602052020	About a Boy	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Clever, Charming	Another hysterical, fresh perspective from one of my favorite authors.  I definitely suggest reading this before you see the movie...and I definitely suggest reading it.	2002-05-20

A young girl's struggle with her circumstances, her life and the people in it is voiced eloquently and with great insight and sensitivity.  Incredibly well-done.	2002-04-09

He hadn't lost his perspective as he grew older (and possibly wiser) through the years.  Perfect for children of all ages (perhaps especially us older children).	2002-04-09

However, the more I read, the more I was caught up in the character and the story.  A good vacation book--it's long, so you'll need plenty of time blocked out.	2002-04-09

I found Martin's inisghts to be uncanny.  His delivery was perfectly dry and witty, and the story itself, while possibly trivial, is life.  How can that really be trivial?	2002-02-17

This was was fairly interesting, though, if for no other reason than the fact that Capote was so unusual.  The high society peek was also entertaining.	2002-02-12

However, this is really well done &amp; sensitive.  The view the reader has into each of the female protagonists is intoxicating.  The social studies lessons are important, and not often examined here in the US.  It inspired me to want much more information on the African continent, how it evolved and how it continues to do so.	2002-01-02
