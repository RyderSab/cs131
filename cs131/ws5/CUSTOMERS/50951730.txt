US	50951730	R2K60QQ9CFHZBY	0385731981	72539575	Jailbait	Books	4	5	6	N	N	An interesting read	The title and cover seem to imply more drama than this novel provides - Andi's affair with an older man, Frank, is instead a private matter, which makes the story all the more realistic. In 1971, Andi is fifteen-going-on-sixteen, a somewhat overweight (so she thinks) loner at school (her best friend has moved away, her brother is at college) and bullied slightly. When she meets Frank, a handsome older man who drives by her every day on her way home, she creates romantic scenarios inside her head, falling hard and fast for a guy she barely knows, even after she spends time with him. She's drawn in by the compliments and the intimacy, and even when he becomes distant or abusive, she still cares about him and wants him to go back to the way he was. Although sex is a part of this novel such scenes are appropriately non-graphic, as befits the YA audience, and while the conclusion isn't entirely satisfactory (particularly given that the reader sees the unhealthy relationship far more clearly than Andi appears to) it does feel authentic.	2005-09-20
US	50951730	R37T05FQ1U9XC8	006077620X	157888127	Sugar Rush	Books	3	2	3	N	N	A fairly good book...	This was a refreshing look at teen sexuality in that the angsting over being attracted to a girl was kept to a minimum, and the focus was instead on the particular girl - Sugar, aka Maria Sweet, the beautiful party girl who befriends the narrator, Kim, when she transfers to a new school. The style is realistically teenagerish and although drugs and sex play a part, graphic details are kept to a minimum. However, it gets tiresome after a bit - especially with the use of various nicknames - and the ending comes out of the blue and makes little sense. Worth reading in the context of the lesbian YA fiction genre but hardly spectacular enough to recommend to a general audience.	2005-09-20
US	50951730	R3RRBUBOR9X737	0446692867	259444644	English as a Second Language	Books	5	8	12	N	N	Surprisingly clever and touching	A 26-year-old American girl fed up in her job and motivated by the fact that her ex-boyfriend laughs at the thought of her being able to get into Oxford as a post-grad student, attempts to do just that. Oxford reject her, but another UK university takes her on (it's quite telling that even though the university is not named or given a specific location, the descriptions are still authentic enough to apply to countless universities across England) and so she begins her MA programme. From the title I imagined a large portion of the book would be devoted to differences between American and English cultures with a few language-related misunderstandings thrown in for good measure, but the commentary of that nature is kept to a minimum and instead the book focuses on things like Alex's housemates (one sensible, one mad, and one in love with a Vulture), drinking companions (Jason and Toby), fellow Americans who feel the need to share everything with her (Suzanne), inappropriate attraction to one of her lecturers (the Heathcliff-esque Sean Douglas) and her insecurities as far as academia go (which was probably my favourite aspect of the book). Funny and charming and astute.	2005-09-20

He, Min and Gunnar spend the summer working as camp counselors, and the book focusses mostly on the first two weeks of camp - a two-week period that's reserved for burn survivors. Russel expects his group of ten-year-old boys to be all noble and tragic, what with their history, but in fact finds that they're... well, ten-year-old boys. Brats, basically. One of the main issues in the book is how people deal with being around burn survivors - there's this great but awful scene in which they're out in the \\"real world\\" and some guys call the kids freaks, and Russel says nothing. Ouch. Russel is a flawed hero - and you can't help but identify with him. There's also a love triangle of sorts, when Russel and Min fall for the same guy, the delicious Web, and a fight between Russel and Gunnar when Russel is determined to set Gunnar up with a girl he thinks is perfect for him, despite Gunnar's insistence that he's giving up girls. It's a well-paced realistic look at gay teenagers, kids, summer camp and love.	2005-09-20

The observations by the narrator and heroine (or anti-heroine, if you prefer) are spot on - Lee Fiora notes the interactions between students and staff and the rules of discussing money in this upper-middle-class environment where she is one of a handful of scholarship students. On the other hand, her academic progress and her interactions with her family outside of school are only briefly touched upon, and although the boarding school atmosphere is captured and the intensity of adolescence almost tangible on the pages, it feels too much like a memoir, rather than a work of fiction, to be completely comfortable.	2005-09-20

Ash is a 'normal' kid, planning to move into a teeny-tiny apartment with boyfriend TJ after graduation rather than going to college, works a job which involves dressing up as a rat and dealing with obnoxious customers, and is going to have to attend detention every day between now and the end of term if she wants to graduate. She isn't remotely enthused about the upcoming prom and thinks it's pretty stupid but when disaster strikes and she finds herself getting involved, she might just get a magical night of her very own. This is sweet and realistic and even though it's quite different to Catalyst or Speak, still brilliant and extremely readable.	2005-09-20

Macy likes being in control and being organised. Her boyfriend, Jason, is perfect - and has the emotional IQ of an amoeba. Neither she nor her mother have really got over the sudden death of her father a year and a half previously, and go around insisting that they're \\"fine\\".<br />After Jason breaks up with her, via email, Macy accepts the offer of a job at Wish Catering, which ends up changing her summer and indeed her life. Surrounded by chaos, she starts to learn that things don't always have to be perfect, and embraces her newfound friends - the style-mad boy-crazy Kristy, Monotone Monica, obsessing-over-the-end-of-the-world Bert, and the artistic and rather attractive Wes.<br />Through games of Truth she and Wes learn a lot more about each other, and she finally opens up about her father's death, and eventually learns to grieve.<br />Like Dessen's other novels, this deals with an Issue - loss - but does so as part of telling a much more complex story. This is also a story about embracing imperfection, about family, about friendship, about love. And about meatballs.	2004-06-18
US	50951730	R1ULWWIJCYNZCZ	0316733695	219566897	Luna	Books	4	38	39	N	N	Probably my favourite Julie Anne Peters book yet...	This is a story dealing with a topic not often dealt with in YA fiction - transgender teenagers. Regan is fifteen and her life is dominated by her older brother, Liam (Lia Marie, and later Luna, at night). She has drifted apart from friends her own age because of him, and in order to try and help him she has offered to let him use her room at night, to try on girls' clothes. The only thing she has that's *hers* is her babysitting job for a family she sees as perfect and normal, in sharp contrast to her own, with her drugged-up mother and domineering father.<br /><br />Regan is a sympathetic character, a girl who tries so hard to be there for her brother when he needs her, but also someone who resents how she has to be everything for him, his sole confidant, and who alternates between feeling sorry for him and for wishing that he could just be normal. She also has her own dilemma, involving an infatuation with a boy at school. \\"Luna\\" is Regan's story as much as it is Liam's.<br /><br />Liam/Luna's story is dealt with effectively as well, with flashbacks of their childhood showing early signs that he really did want to be in a girl's body. The separation of gender and sexuality is also made quite clear, and the idea of constructed gender roles is also dealt with (though not as much as I'd like to have seen it discussed - but the perfect amount for a YA novel). It is by no means a definitive transgendered-teen story but it shouldn't have to be, either - it's merely the story of one girl in a boy's body, trying to break free.<br /><br />A worthwhile read that will hopefully challenge readers' ideas towards gender and sex while telling a compelling story.	2004-06-18

Everything rings true - from the description of the gifted youth program, to the friendships Nic forms, to feeling uncomfortable that she actually gets along with her parents, to her infatuation with and later relationship with Battle. Some moments stick out for me - Katrina's reaction to the Nic/Battle relationship (which was delightfully true-to-life, and I loved it - Katrina is one of my favourite characters in the book) and Nic thinking she sees Battle while she's on an archaeological field trip, only to discover it's not her. Definitely one to reread. I'm looking forward to the sequel.	2004-05-29

It occasionally veers towards being shallow and superficial, though the concept was an interesting one - particularly the framing device, which I would have loved to have played a bigger part. The three girls, Jade, Amber, and Opal, were all interesting characters, with their personality traits corresponding to their individual gemstones, and there are a lot of nifty ideas within this novel. Worth reading, though I suspect it has lost something in the translation.	2004-05-08

Fairytales are retold and rewoven in this collection of thirteen stories by Emma Donoghue. It begins with The Tale Of The Shoe, in which Cinderella ends up running off with her fairy godmother, and finishes with The Tale Of The Kiss, an original take on the theme of witches in fairytales and the story from which the collection gets its name. The language is smooth and sensual; the new perspective or new twist brought to the familiar tales is sometimes surprising, always innovative. Highly recommended.	2004-05-08

Aimee Carter creates a world that is similar to our own, but with one very important difference - how many of us have the same dream every night, with a mysterious man who seems to know a great deal about our lives and offers us advice? Not many, I'd wager, but such is the case for Zac Lucas, the protagonist of 'Phoenix Ashes' and the following two as-of-yet unpublished novels in the trilogy. We meet Zac at age six - an orphan who is tormented by his bullying cousin, Blake, and ignored by his wealthy uncle Robert, but finds allies in his friend Elizabeth and later his aunt Alexa - not to mention Minty, who appears in his dreams every night. We watch him get older, and eventually spiral into despair when events in his life threaten to overwhelm him. A powerful read, offering up opinions on life, death, faith, love, morality and friendship, as well as being just plain enjoyable and engaging.	2003-10-22
US	50951730	R2EQVFX4ZX3387	0670035661	521601309	Catalyst	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A good read, but...	As several other reviewers have mentioned, 'Catalyst' does not compare to 'Speak'. To put it simply, Kate, our heroine here, is not a character it's easy to sympathise with, or even identify. At first she seems intriguing and promising (the Good Kate and Bad Kate idea) but after a while this wears off, and you become frustrated with her. I was disgusted with what she put up with from Teri, the class bully and 'weird kid', and despite the fact that we're supposed to develop sympathy for Teri as well by the end of the novel, I couldn't stand her. These are not terribly likeable characters.<br />Having said that, I did read the book twice within the space of a month, so it's not all bad. Many 'serious student'/'geek' types will be able to relate to the pressure Kate is under, and the storyline is fairly interesting. Read with caution, I suppose.	2003-04-08
US	50951730	RJJ2PMWHWVB9D	0440226430	902500282	Summer Sisters	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Great read	One of my favourite books of all time, one of those books where you find something new in it every time you read it. Judy Blume writes in a deceptively simple way, but her characters are stunning complex, as is the case with her young adult novels. Although it may seem like it's merely a book about two friends who fall in love with the same man, it's really about their tumultuous friendship. It's about Vix (Victoria), a smart girl from a deprived background, whose entry into the privileged world of Caitlin Somers will change her life forever. Blume doesn't hold back as she describes Vix's infatuation with the intriguing Caitlin, her desire to be a part of the family, her adolescent crushes, and her acceptance of Caitlin's betrayals. From early on, there are hints that Caitlin is troubled, and foreshadowing of what is to come. The story takes us through eighteen years in their lives, with the majority of the book taking place from Vix's point of view, although interspersed with first-person vignettes from the emotionally rich supporting characters like Vix's parents, Caitlin's family, and a few of the romantic interests. Although marketed as an adult novel, Blume's strength (as in 'Smart Women') is in capturing the teenage years perfectly, and is best read as a young adult book with more honesty and less censorship.	2002-06-27

Managing to poke fun at absolutely everything in the Star Trek universe, this book isn't exactly fine literature, but will make you laugh as Smirk and Jean-Lucy Ricardo collide in an attempt to handle the Cellulites.

Love story? Yes, that's there. Coming-of-age tale? That too. Ethical and moral debate? Yes. A story about life, death, desperation, making choices, family, love, pain, joy, and truth? It's all there.<br />Apart from all that, it's a fabulous read, with unique characters so well-developed you'll feel that you've known them since childhood, and twists in the tale that will literally prevent you from putting the book down for even a moment. It's in parts almost epic, and in other parts a simple fable. I leave you with two words of advice - read it.	2002-06-02

It is not a straightforward biography, but an intensely personal account of the last twelve years of Mercury's life, during which time Peter Freestone was his personal assistant and close friend. Freestone still remains fiercely loyal and wants us to understand the sort of devotion that those close to Mercury gave to him. He describes not just a rock star and a legend, but a fascinating man who was, by all accounts, one of a kind. Readers hoping to hear about Mercury's early life will be disappointed, but those wanting a behind-the-scenes, what-he-was-really-like account will love this book, as I did.	2002-06-01

Of course, I was wrong. Anyone who has ever read anything by Peter David will know that one of his strongest points, apart from being a master of the scifi/fantasy genre, is to create fascinating characters with a lot of tongue-in-cheek dialogue and situations. The latter is omnipresent in this book - you get the feeling that David has thought up something witty to say, and creates a whole situation just so he can use that oneliner. It makes for fabulously entertaining reading.	2002-05-31

If you're looking for an episode guide, this is not it. It's a cute scrapbook of Buffy: the High School Years laid out like the Sunnydale High Yearbook, and includes plenty of pictures as well as articles about various school events and societies, with comments from the characters scrawled in (Oz's apology to Buffy for chattering on is hilarious) including a must-read poem by Cordelia and Snyder's remark that at least he can be sure that the school will remain standing long after she leaves it. The pictures near the end include information about each of the characters, ranging from the central figures like Buffy, Willow, Xander, etc to Jonathan and Harmony, to the once-off characters from Season 1 that we'd forgotten about, under headings like interests, activities, and a quote from each of them, as well as their memories. This is possibly the most detailed, for-the-most-obsessive-of-fans section, with characters' shout-outs to one another about various events. My favourite part of the book is one of the ads near the end, placed by a student who has a secret crush on Jonathan and hopes one day to tell him. Very sweet. For die-hard fans, a fun read.	2002-05-31

Everyone else has found their niche, some clique to fit into - Goths, Thespians, Jocks. Melinda fits in nowhere. She doesn't speak. Nobody really wants to hear what you think, she informs the reader. While this is a commentary on the many flaws of high school, with lists like The First Ten Lies They Tell You In High School and ironic vignettes detailing the often idiotic nature of the staff and traditions (the school council's continual changing of the football team's name is a recurring issue), it's also the story of one girl's struggle to deal with a trauma, and to overcome her past. Funny and touching, and possibly one of the best young adult novels out there.	2002-05-31

This book fits in as both #3 of the DS9 Relaunch series and the Section 31 quartet. It mainly focusses on Julian Bashir, everyone's favourite genetically-enhanced Section-31-battling doctor, and his significant other, the simultaneously cute, quirky and intelligent Ezri Dax. In my mind these are two of the most interesting characters in the DS9 universe, and getting a whole book about them is a lovely treat. Fans of DS9 who haven't read the Avatar books yet can happily skip through the parts featuring Ro, Taran'atar, et al, but for those who have, the subplots are fascinating too.<br />Dr Locken is the villain, a genetically enhanced being who has decided to follow in the ways of Khan and create a race of superhumans. Section 31 recruit Bashir to stop this man, but as usual, things are not quite that simple. The characterisation of both Bashir and Dax is excellent and true-to-the-series.<br />My favourite of the four Section 31 books (the only one I'd read again) and ideal for all DS9 fans.	2002-05-31

Even while dealing with issue of teenage pregnancy, she chose to have the character be raped so that she was absolved from responsibility. This book is no exception. As for the preaching - the character constantly berates herself for not being positive enough, and reminding herself what she's grateful for, usually accompanied by capital letters and excessive exclamation marks. The narrator is too-good-to-be-true and her style too juvenile for her age, but if you enjoyed other works by Dr Sparks, pick it up - it's almost identical to everything else she's written.	2002-05-31

Beckett's story of an evil stepmother, suicidal peers, a father she can't trust anymore and a boy she loves is vague at times, almost dream-like, but that's part of the effect. \\"Innocence\\" is a coming-of-age, conspiracy-riddled, horror masterpiece.

I wasn't disappointed.<br />The story focusses on a group of people with psychic powers, or Talents, known as Kithkinners. As it begins, some of them know each other, and others meet and interact as the story progresses. Penny, married with a three-year-old son and eight months pregnant, knows she has to get away. She doesn't know why, but her Danger Instinct is telling her she must. Her husband, after an unusual encounter with a neighbour, trusts her instincts. April is babysitting for Kirsty when her cousin's boyfriend, Gavin, shows up at the door, injured and on the run from the law. Genevieve is haunted by dreams of the Selector, and after a man using his words shows up and tries to kill her, she knows she has to leave.<br />Their paths cross and the secrets to their identity lie in a simple nursery rhyme that they remember from their childhood. The talents they have will eventually save them from the monstrous Selector and his minions.<br />That's making the story sound cliched and predictable, but it's far more complex than that. Although other reviewers have argued that the novel is incoherent, I found it to be one of the most wonderfully woven-together stories around. Everything just clicked into place. It's a story about instinct, love, trust and terror. A worthwhile read, to say the least.	2002-05-31

I think people are missing the point. Wurtzel describes quite clearly how depression is about *you*. It's about looking out for number one, being so weighed down by that black cloud that it's impossible to care about anyone else. She describes feeling guilty for being depressed, pointing out that she can't blame her family life or circumstances, not knowing who or what or why is making her feel that way. Her helplessness and frustration and acute self-hatred are tangible in these pages. You know exactly how she feels, and you understand her. That's the beauty of this book, and that is why it's so utterly compelling.	2002-05-31

This girl is conveniently surrounded by people who care about her, in particular &quot;Sandy Sherman&quot;, the ever-so-wonderful psychologist (featured previously in The Best Little Girl...) who jots down notes about her progress, letting the reader know how well our Katie is coming along. It simplifies a complex disorder into &quot;family problems and too much pressure make little girls want to cut themselves&quot;. Levenkron, in the guise of Sandy Sherman, explains that Katie has a personality disorder which triggers her moments of &quot;spacing out&quot;, something which is *not* common to self-injurers and should not be used to explain it. A final word of warning to anyone who hurts themselves, or has recently stopped - this book is *extremely* triggering, and should be avoided.	2002-05-28

Of course, these adjectives could be used to describe almost any of Peter David's books, but this one happens to be one of my favourites. Although the main focus of the novel is McHenry, and the revelation that he is not quite human - which explains his almost supernatural abilities and Q's deference towards him - we also dip into the lives of the other characters. David's skill is his ability to intertwine science fiction with drama, and his characters are among the most complex out there. The story switches between the Excalbiur and the Trident, Calhoun and Shelby's ships respectively, and the various officers on each. High points of the novel (well, higher) included the M'Ress/Arex/Gleau interaction and the mysterious &quot;changes&quot; occuring in Zak Kebron. It had its funny, tongue-in-cheek moments, too, again typical of David. And, again typical of the most infuriating and brilliant writer in the field of Star Trek novels, it ends with multiple cliffhangers.	2002-05-28

US	50951730	R2B5QFHLYWU2GO	0671695304	406487710	Forever	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Read this book . . .	In a beautifully told tale of first love, Judy Blume describes a relationship which Katherine, the narrator, believed could last forever. When she meets Michael at a New Year's party they hit it off and they start  going out. Katherine is deeply in love with him and once she's sure the  love is real, they make love. It is not as perfect as Hollywood movies  would have you believe but Katherine and Michael keep sleeping together. Of  course they are always responsible, there seems to be no question about it.  As the book was first published in 1975, taking precautions meant avoiding  pregnancy; now it means also avoiding STDs such as Hepatitis and AIDS.  Therefore some of the advice Katherine is given when she goes to the family  planning clinic would not apply to now. However the book is excellent and a  wonderful read.	1999-08-03
