In this outing, Ferguson is called out to help search for a woman gone missing over night.  Van Alstyne, on the other hand, has taken the day off because it's his birthday.  Ferguson and her fellow searchers don't find the missing woman.  More events keep piling up - a death, a woman found severely beaten, and the missing woman - seemingly unrelated.<br /><br />The plot of this story is complex, but Spencer-Fleming manages to keep all the story lines going forward and advancing the story towards solving the mystery of who did what to whom.  It is told from the point of view of several characters, including Ferguson and Van Alstyne.  It wasn't until nearly three-quarters of the way through the book that the story turns to Ferguson and Van Alstyne.  The jumping from point of view to point of view was disconcerting.  I missed solving the mystery with Ferguson and Van Alstyne from start to finish.  I hope Spencer-Fleming doesn't continue to write in this format.<br /><br />I've enjoyed each of the entries in this series.  However, this entry was my least favorite.  I will certainly read the next entry, but if she continues to write in this format, it will be my last.	2005-08-18

Why?  His father, who died in the WTC tragedy, left a blue vase in his closet.  The vase held a key in a small brown envelope with the word \\"black\\" on it.  The boy assumes that \\"black\\" refers to a person's last name hence the interviews.  He is convinced that locating this person will lead to finding out exactly how his father really died.<br /><br />I read the book all the way to the end because I thought that surely there would be a point to page after page after page of precocious non-punctuated musings by this boy.  Unfortunately, there was no point to the musings.<br /><br />I suggest you save your money because there is no closure at the end of the book.  It is a rambling, long-winded, and twisted tale.<br /><br />Not since John Grisham's \\"The Client\\" has there been such a character in a boy's body but with the mind of 40-year-old man.  Both are equally preposterous.	2005-07-10

For a while, they had become formulaic, but with Hancock Park, she has become a mystery writer worthy of the name. She's no P.D. James or Laurie R. King, but she has written a fine mystery with a surprise ending. Unlike some other writers, she shared all the clues with the reader, and still came up with an unexpected ending.<br /><br />In addition to a terrific mystery, it is also a very good character study. Detective Delafield has matured over the years, and in this outing her partner walks out and forces Delafield to face up to her own shortcomings.	2005-07-03

That said, I did not come to this book with any expectations other than expecting a good read from an author whose name I've seen on others' lists of good books.<br /><br />I quite enjoyed this book.  As with any good book, it drew me in slowly, building the mystery slowly, allowing the reader to know the characters and form opinions.  There were no red herrings, there were, however, plot twists that kept things interesting.<br /><br />The author did a very good job of dealing with Lord John's private lifestyle - hinting at it for several chapters and then admitting to it and dealing with it with sensitivity.<br /><br />There were two things that disappointed me about this book the first was that I felt the ending was too rushed.  After all, the author had leisurely taken us down the path of finding out who killed whom, but one minute we're on a ship and the next minute  Lord John is in London and the book ends.<br /><br />The other thing that disappointed me was that the second book in this announced trilogy has not yet been published.	2004-08-14

Stubbs finds the woman who recruited her dead in the new gym's swimming pool. She sets out - kind of - to find out who killed the woman while trying to settle into her new job.<br />It is obvious that this book was written by two authors (Jill Ker Conway and Elizabeth Kennan writing as Clare Munnings) because one author uses polysllabic words where a one syllable word would suffice - I found it jarring and disruptive.  I'm not opposed to polysllabic words, I just don't like seeing them used for the sake of using them - it's as if the author wanted us to know that she could use the words.  It is this same author who could have used a strong editor because some of her sentences were very hard to understand in the context of the paragraph and the events occurring in the book.  Also there isn't a smooth flow of time in the book.  One minute Stubbs in on the streets of New York and the next she's driving up I-91 in Vermont.<br />I'll read the second book in this series, but I won't read beyond that if the problems mentioned above continue.	2004-01-14

I bought it when I lived in Texas, shipped it to Vermont when I moved, and it's been on my bookshelf for nearly four years.  I finally picked it up to read the other day, and could kick myself for not reading it sooner.<br />This is a wonderful first book.  It's got a great plot with lots of twists and turns, quirky characters who are easy to like, and, of course, Loon Lake.<br />Unlike other first-time authors, Houston did not keep secrets from the reader.  As the characters found bits and pieces of the puzzle, Houston let us in on them, too.<br />I'm one of those readers who like to read series in order, and I'm sorry it took me so long to read this because I know I'm going to have a hard time finding &quot;Dead Creek&quot; (2000) and &quot;Dead Water (2001).

If you've enjoyed the previous 12 Kate Shugaks, then you'll love this entry.<br />Kate is still trying to deal with having young Johnny Morgan living with her in her one-room cabin.  She knows that a confrontation with his mother will come sooner than either she or Johnny wants.<br />Johnny and some of his classmates find a dead body in a glacier.  Trooper Jim Chopin has his plate full and asks Kate to investigate why the Park's handyman was killed.  When she starts asking questions, she finds out more than she wants to know about her fellow Park rats.<br />In the meantime, Jim Chopin turns up the heat on their non-existent, but definitely &quot;something's going on&quot; relationship.  Kate thinks she's sure what she thinks about that - well, maybe.<br />Stabenow is adept in this outing in keeping the identity of the killer under wraps until the end - and the reason for the killing will stun you.<br />Stabenow has written another excellent mystery.  Her writing is so good you can almost smell the spring in Alaska and find yourself being glad the winter is over.	2003-09-09

I read Clare's first book (Bleeding Out, Firebrand Books, 2000)and was amazed and astounded at the talent of that debut mystery.<br />In this outing, Detective L.A. Franco of the LAPD is faced with the murder of the Estrella family in the barrio.  With few leads, and a closed society with its code of silence, she has difficulty finding the killer.  Finally, the coroner makes a suggestion, over dinner, that leads to Franco building a case against the killer.<br />[...]  There are too many typos, too many barrio words that need explanation (there are whole conversations that, unless the reader speaks the language, leaves the reader in the dark), too many instances where the author changed a character's name and the old name remains in the manuscript.  The book, at 292 pages, is too long - another problem a good editor could fix.<br />This book did not have the robust, assured writing of the first.  I'm hoping that this is merely the second-book doldrums and Clare returns to what made Bleeding Out such a strong entry in the world of procedurals.<br />[...]	2003-05-28

There wasn't much to this book - not much plot, not much mystery, not much character development.  I keep reading the books in this series because hope springs eternal - that Claire McNab will be able to find the writing skills she exhibited in the first three or four outings, that Carol Ashton will develop into a real person, that her character will grow and become interesting once again.  But once again, I was disappointed.<br />If you want to read a decent book by Claire McNab, read her new series featuring Denise Cheever.  That is where McNab seems to be putting her creative writing to best use these days.	2003-02-24

While working there, she also takes on a missing person's case from a wealthy woman with secrets of her own.<br />If you've ever been in Boston or love the city from afar, you'll enjoy this book.  Barnes catches the ambiance of Boston to perfection - better than Parker in my mind.<br />Barnes has aloowed her character to mature over the years and Carlotta was less foolish in this outing than in others.  And it was interesting watching her put two and two together to solve both cases.<br />Barnes, for the most part, didn't keep major pieces of evidence from the reader although she did in one instance and the reader is sure to yell, \\"No fair!\\" or some such.<br />This is a good procedural - although there are better ones out there - it is worth the read if you love Boston as I do.	2002-12-29

I agree that this outing is less than the others, but when the others were so far above the genre, that says much for A Fearsome Doubt.<br />In this outing, Rutledge's self doubts are aggravated by the possibility that he may have aided in the wrongful conviction of a man fairly early in his career.  He must unofficially investigate the allegations recently put to him that the wrong man was convicted of three elderly women.  But where to start since the man convicted was executed and the main witness dead.<br />He is officially assigned to investigate three murders in Kent.  Someone is murdering veterans who lost a limb in the war.  Who would do such a thing?  The murderer is clever and has left no clues as to his identity.  While he is searching for clues, Rutledge runs head-long into his past.<br />The writing continues to be remarkable, the character is ever evolving, and the mysteries still remain mysterious.  That said, there was something missing from this entry in the series.  I think it was that the author had events moving at a lower pace than usual.  Thus, it wasn't the page turner that others in the series had been.	2002-12-15

The conclusions he draws will shock the local people as well as the local policeman.<br />Todd has one of the four best British procedural series going (the others being Crombie, Robinson, and James).  Todd's series is special, however, because he has set it immediately after World War I and his character is flawed because of his experiences in the trenches of France.<br />Todd's writing continues to be impressive and his plotting superb.  He does not use devices that will give his detective more information than he gives his readers.  He has maintained Inspector Rutledge's voice and that of  his alter-ego Hamish in this outing.<br />Todd has written a procedural - it is not machine gun paced - it's not supposed to be.  If you're looking for a book that you can read in a single setting and still figure out whodunnit, don't pick up this series.  But if you enjoy going along with the detective as he/she investigates a crime step-by-step, then try this series.  You won't be disappointed.<br />If you intend to read this series, start with Todd's first effort A Test of Wills so you get the sense of the character and his suffering.	2002-07-07

This is not one of her best.  There's too much description and not enough action.  There's not much plot - what there is takes place in the last 60 pages of the book.<br />It's more of a series transition - moving Kate from mourning Jack to a new relationship.  It is as if the author had to meet a deadline for a book and this was the result.  Stabenow's heart didn't seem to be in this book.  I'm hoping that this really is a transition, and not the beginning of the end.  I hope Stabenow will be back in form in the next Kate Shugak book.	2002-06-23

As her winning streak continues, no one is more surprised than she.<br />The author uses the national spelling bee as the trigger that begins the disintegration of this Jewish-American family.<br />Godberg tells a compelling and engaging story that draws the reader along the convoluted paths of the family members. Her writing is fluid, intelligent, and thought provoking.<br />However, the author ends the story so abruptly that she leaves many loose threads dangling.

His return to Scotland Yard was seen by his sister and doctor as too soon, but Rutledge could not afford to sit around listening to the voice in his head.<br />In this outing, Rutledge is sent to deal with Lady Maude who has been offended by previous police visitors.  Rutledge's task is to mollify Lady Maude and to determine whether her daughter is missing.<br />In Scotland, there is a woman accused of murder in Duncarrick, but did she kill the woman whose bones have been found hidden in the hills - and do those bones belong to Lady Maude's daughter?<br />As with the earlier entries in this series, the evidence is revealed to the reader as Rutledge uncovers it - piece by piece.  And the reader has the advantage of hearing what Rutledge and the voice in his head think of the evidence.<br />This is procedural at its very best.  The author is a talented writer who makes the reader feel the anguish and hear the bagpipes in the hills.<br />If you are thinking of reading this series, I recommend that you read the first entry before taking on the others for it was in the first entry that we learn of the voice in Rutledge's head and who it belonged to and why it's there.<br />Mysteries just don't get any better than this series!	2002-06-20

The only drawback is that it was written in the 1960s, and while it says that it was updated in 1994, the updates did not (and could not due to space constraints) do justice to the upheaval and turmoil that has occurred in the decades since it was origninally written.<br />A slightly newer history that might serve as well is Paul Johnson's A History of the Jews (1998).

While Aud doesn't think she's ready to return to the world, Julia's voice keeps telling her that she needs to stay in the world.  She goes to New York and finds the woman.  From that point on, her life careens along  - seemingly out of control - and full of ephiphanies and unexpected twists.<br />This series is dark - the protagonist is devastated with grief and guilt over her lover's death - and she is dangerous.  The people she seeks are not always amongst the human race's finest specimans.<br />Griffith is a talented author whose writing improves with each outing.  Aud is finely drawn, as are the lesser characters.  The descriptions of Aud's North Carolina hideaway are vividly written - so much so you can hear the birds calling to one another in your head and smell the wood smoke from her fire.  Aud is damaged and struggling with the decision whether to remain alive.<br />Griffith is an underappreciated author who deserves a much wider audience.  If you decided to read this novel, read the first in the series. A Blue Place before starting this one.  I think you'll be hooked and waiting for the third Aud Torvingen novel with Griffith's other fans.	2002-05-12

His writing is precise and concise - each word chosen with care.  Rutledge contunues to be a tortured soul who is a compassionate and intelligent investigator.  Todd's ending surprised me, but that just makes for good reading.<br />If you enjoy procedurals, make sure you read this series.

This book tells us without actually hammering at us that it takes work to establish and nourish a friendship.  The two women are near opposites with only their religion in common, but over the course of a summer in Glouchester, MA, they cement what will, no doubt, be a life-long friendship.<br />The author's writing style is wonderfully simple and the book is fast paced.

Immediately there is trouble when the two young adults refuse to dampen their Quaker enthusiasm before the town elders who are Puritan - each religion thinks the other to be wrong-minded.<br />The book opens with the discovery of the body of a sailor from one of Catherine's ships. After a series of events leads to the death of one of the central people in this drama, Catherine and Massaquoit must solve the murder lest an innocent be unfairly convicted.<br />This is one of the outstanding historical series around, and with each outing, the characters become more developed and the plots more complex.  Always present is the history of the period - not interfering with the character development or the plot but certainly an important part of each book.<br />If you're just discovering the series, I'd recommend that you begin with the first book, THE DUMB SHALL SING, to familiarize yourself with how the unlikely pair of Catherine and Massaquoit meet and come to respect each other.<br />The only thing that concerns me is that 15 years have passed since the first book.  Since Catherine was no youngster in the first book, she must be nearing elder stage by the day's standards.

She is most often used as a decoy or undercover operative. When one of her assignments goes bad, her partner is killed and she is terribly wounded - both physically and mentally. From that point, the book takes off on a wild ride spanning three continents.<br />There is something that doesn't ring true with Eddy's Flint. Is it because he's tried to make her both SuperWoman and vulnerable, sane and slightly not, reckless and conservative? Whatever it is, Flint is flawed. There is very little character development in the book - the book is not about character development - but the plot is outstanding - the book's strong point. I agree that the book is hard to put down, you may want to read it one sitting. But don't. This book needs to be read slowly lest you miss one of the subtleties the author throws randomly throws in.	2001-08-29

But the book is stolen before he can enjoy it and the hunt is on.<br />While Kaewert writes well, there was just too much to this book. Too many subplots, too many characters, too many agendas, too many attempted murders, too many coincidences, etc.  Kaewert did well in keeping everything straight, but all that detracted from the mystery and the ending was too pat.<br />I'll try the next in the series as well, but if the author continues to overwrite her books, I'll move on to another series with an author who can tell a good story in terser language.	2001-08-22

There she has purchased a fixer-upper, which at times, seems to be haunted, but certainly has a history.  After an unknown person has plunged to his almost-certain death off the cliffs,she has to deal with a visitor from the City whom she may or may not have invited to stay with her and whom may or may not be who and what he says he is and seems to be interested in the age-old story of an unknown Stradivarius said to have been secreted away by her house's original owner.<br />While Jake battles the house to keep it standing,she has to deal with this stranger, her 18-year-old son's infatuation with a girl Jake considers to be inappropriate, and,certainly not least, the ladies reading club is meeting at her house this month and her mysterious guest has knocked a hole in her dining room wall.<br />Graves gives us a multi-faceted plot with several story lines, new as well as familiar characters, and, of course Maine.  She is a talented writer who is able to keep all the story lines moving right along, keep the mystery moving toward a satisfactory end, and continue to grow her characters.<br />If you haven't read anything in this series, start with DEAD CAT BOUNCE, the first in the series, and you'll read the three other entries.  Then, you'll join the ranks of her other fans eagerly awaiting the next entry in this excellent, if not eccentric, series.

The book's central character is Danny, newly divorced and newly attracted to women.  Her life is complicated by Maureen, Chris, and her best friend since grade school, Kara. The ebb and flow of Danny's relationships with these women is the plot of the book.<br />Calhoun doesn't skimp on the secondary characters either.  There's the gay couple who ostensibly open a bed &amp; breakfast but it caters primarily to AIDS patients and there is the Wisconsin scenery.<br />Calhoun is a very good writer who has the talent to be an even better writer if she would stretch to write more complicated plots.  Granted, I've only read three of her books, but the characters, while well-drawn in each book, are interchangeable.  For instance, Danny could be the central character in any of Calhoun's books - in other words, the names change, but the story remains the same.  Her publisher should do Calhoun and her readers a favor and let Calhoun stretch her talents.	2001-08-12

While on the surface she acknowledges that a relationship with Diane is impossible, she can't seem to establish a committed relationship with another woman.<br />Calhoun is a talented writer with finely drawn characters. Unfortunately, you only need to read one or two books by Calhoun to know what the plots of all her books will be.  In each book, there is the main character who is attracted to her best friend who is not interested so the main character turns to other women for physicality and a gay man for a secondary friendship.<br />Calhoun needs to stretch her talents to be the best she can be.  If she does, that's when we'll have some very, very good lesbian novels come out of the mainstream lesbian publishers.	2001-08-12

Two of these women get together but only after the other seduces one of them.<br />Sorting the characters out is, initially, difficult.  I couldn't figure out why until I realized that they are, essentially, interchangeable.  Beyond that, there isn't much of a story line.<br />Despite the book's shortcomings, I enjoyed the author's writing, and wish she'd try a more difficult plot in one of her future books.  I'll try her other books in case this was just a fluke, but I hope she tries to challenge herself.  Her locale descriptions are wonderfully drawn - so much so that you'll be hunting for a sweater as fall turns into winter in the book even if you're sitting in 100 degree weather.	2001-08-07

When the neighbor who finds her looks into her dying eyes, there is a nearly psychic connection that leaves the young white woman reeling. When she suggests that the Annie was murdered by racists to get her out of the white neighborhood, a horrifying series of harassment begins until her husband is convinced she is losing her mind.<br />Twenty years later, Mrs. Ranelagh, the neighbor, returns to England with her husband and teenage sons, a thick file of newspaper clippings and records hidden in her personal things. She picks up the trail again with something of revenge in her heart though she calls it &quot;justice.&quot; The move puts her ten minutes from the doctor who treated Miss Butts just prior to the murder. Her probing leads her to believe Annie was robbed of an enormous wealth of South and Central American artifacts. Worse, Annie was marked as a madwoman by the neighbors and whoever broke in, brought in a dozen or so tortured tomcats and pushed a heavy piece of furniture across the animal access her precious cats used...<br />Someone with a stronger stomach than I will have to complete the book and determine if it is indeed worth the nightmare images of animal cruelty it produces. Minette Walters is a fine writer as evidenced by her previous books from The Ice House to The Breaker, and this book promised more of the same according to its premise. One wonders why she felt it necessary to so graphically describe the cruelty to animals. This book should have come with a warning on the front cover about the graphic and horrific scenes of animal cruelty.	2001-08-06

In this outing, the quest for Queen Nefertiti's murderer continues.<br />This book unlike the first five seems to have more flaws than the others. Robinson felt compelled to tell us the story of Lord Meren's life being saved by Ay, of Kysen's adoption by Lord Meren, etc.  All these stories were told in previous books.  Was it being used as filler in this book?  Perhaps.<br />And yes, there are certain &quot;modernizations&quot; in this book that were not in previous books, particulary that of his daughter - too modern by far even assuming that Lord Mere was a liberal father, which was not mentioned in previous books.<br />This is the second book in a row that the mystery of who killed Nefertiti is the primary focus and Lord Meren's relationship with his family the secondary focus.  The series was much more interesting when a mystery was the primary focus and Lord Meren himself was the secondary focus.  And to add insult to injury, the mystery of who poisoned Nefertiti is not really solved at the end of the book either.<br />The history remains interesting as does Robinson's descriptions of the day-to-day events.<br />I wish I had the choice of giving this 3.5 stars - it doesn't really deserve four stars, but it's better than three stars.  I'll read her next book, if there is one, but if it is as lackluster as this one was, it will be the last I read.  There are just too many other good historical mysteries out there (for instance, Roberta Gellis' series) to waste time on the same book rehashed three or four times.	2001-08-05

Threats are being made that the perp will do great harm to the populace and Liz Grahame, the DI, must find out who it is before he/she makes good on the threats.  In the meantime, Donovan is off recuperating from wounds suffered in the previous outing.<br />This is one of the best British procedurals around.  It is best to start with the first entry so you can see the characters develop over the years.  Bannister is an excellent writer, the plots are complex without being obtuse, and Bannister has the reader present as each new piece of evidence is put into mix.<br />If the series has a flaw, it is the subplots featuring Donovan that the author has begun putting into each book.  While the circumstances change, the result is the same - Donovan is the unwitting hero.	2001-07-19

In this outing, Trade, a full-time rancher and part-time private investigator is asked to investigate the death of an acquaintance by the dead woman's husband who is soon everyone's choice for number-one suspect.  But Trade has her doubts about his guilt.<br />The first two books in this series were tightly written with strong character development.  In this outing, Browning could have used a good editor.  By the middle of the book I was very tired of being told how hot June was.  While the heat can and should be part of the book, reminding me at every turn that it was June and it was hot quickly became tedious.  A good editor might have helped Browning tighten up her writing as well.  By about page 283, I was wondering if the book would ever end.  It did, but with Trade not taking the necessary precautions for her safety that I would have expected an intelligent woman investigating a murder would take knowing the murderer knows she's investigating and that it is only a matter of time before she puts two and two together and points her finger at him/her.<br />I really liked the first two books of this series.  I am hoping that this is a transitional book - the second-book doldrums saved for the third book, and that Browning will be back on track with book four of the series.  This was not a badly written or plotted book, it was, rather, just too long and tedious.	2001-06-18

The series took an unexpected turn in book 9, and with the last two entries, author Dana Stabenow has kept us on edge wondering if Shugak would survive.<br />In this book, Shugak returns to her homestead in the Park for the first time in months.  She is promptly offered a job as a political candidate's protection after the candidate, a Native Alaskan, begins receiving threatening letters.  Shugak, like most police officers, believes that the writer of the letters will go no further than the written word.  But when one of the candidate's staff turns up dead, Shugak is forced to reevaluate her position.  From that point, the book goes into high gear!<br />The characters, especially the ones we've grown to know over the years, are well-drawn and continue to grow and change.  Stabenow gives us some history of Alaska, this time involving a prostitute of the Klondike era.  She keeps you guessing about who did the foul deed although she is such a skillful writer that you find yourself hoping it's one of the campaign staff whom you come to love to hate. Stabenow's writing remains outstanding so much so that you can feel autumn slipping away with each turn of the page - in the back of your head you'll begin to wonder where you can lay your hands on a sweater - even if you're in 90 degree weather.	2001-06-12

This is a fascinating read both from a historical perspective, Crombie is adept at giving you history without making it the focal point, and from a mystery perspective, why would anyone want to run down an Anglican priest and kill a ceramicist?<br />This book has it all - character development (once again Kincaid and James' relationship is changing), plot, mystery, procedural, and good old-fashioned great writing.

And she manages to keep the reader guessing even though there mystery seems shallow enough - it has hidden depths.<br />Luckily, this book did not suffer the second-book-doldrums that so many second books do.

Just prior to his transfer, the Tradmouth police are faced with a kidnapping of a small boy by person or persons unknown. On Peterson's first day on the new job, a woman is found brutally murdered in the local park.  The first thing the police must do is identify her.  Also, archaeologists working on a dig of an Elizabethan merchant's house find a skeleton in what they think is the cellar.  Finally, Peterson's wife begins visiting a local medical clinic in an effort to get pregnant and he must be present at several appointments. Peterson had expected a laid back kind of life in the countryside, but Tradmouth's criminals keep him and his colleagues busy.<br />In the hands of a lesser writer, juggling four distinct stories might turn into a confusing morass.  Ellis, however, pulls it off and keeps the readers' interest sustained in all three stories.  She is able to deftly pull the stories together at the end.  Peterson is an interesting and likable character - well rounded with interests (archaeology to be specific) other than police work.  The minor characters are also likable, and one hopes that they will be fleshed out in future books.<br />While not strictly a historical mystery, one of the four stories is set in Elizabethan Tradmouth and adds piquancy to the modern-day stories.  This has all the potential of being a first-class series - part procedural, part historical, part cozy.  This is an excellent start.	2001-05-17

In this mystery debut, the author has chosen 186 A.D. Roman Britain to set her mystery.  Her protagonist is Libertus, a freedman and pavement maker, whose mentor, Marcus Septimus, occasionally asks for favors.  This time, Crassus Germanicus has been brutally murdered, and Marcus wants to know by whom.  As Libertus begins his investigation by interviewing Crassus' slaves, he begins to suspect that each slave is only telling him enough to satisfy his immediate questions.  As he digs deeper, he finds several slaves with either the motive or the means, but not both.  In addition, more bodies turn up further muddying the waters.  As he closes in on the murderer, his life is in danger, too.<br />Rowe's debut mystery is a page-turner.  The fact that it is not set in Rome as the other two major series (Lindsey Davis and Steven Saylor, authors)are is a plus.  Libertus is an interesting man with much to lose if he is not successful in finding the murderer and not much to gain if he succeeds.  Rowe does not let her history interfere with her story, and yet the fear the slaves face is palpable.  There is much to learn of Roman Britain from this book.  The relationship between Libertus and his own slave is interesting, and will, no doubt, be expanded upon as the series progresses.  All in all, a very interesting read.  In addition, it augurs well for the series.	2001-05-17

Isaac is a believable and likable character, Roe's characterizations of even the minor chararacters are well drawn.  Roe does not overwhelm her readers with historical minutiae that impedes her story, but gives enough history to satisfy those of us who prefer our history wrapped in a mystery.

Her sister, Mary, sits on the throne and, fearing an uprising in Elizabeth's favor, has exiled Elizabeth from her court.  Elizabeth lives in the countryside under the watchful eyes of Sir Thomas Pope.  Elizabeth receives a missive from her Aunt Mary Boleyn begging her to visit.  Elizabeth knows that Sir Thomas will refuse the visit so she sneaks out and makes her way to her Aunt Mary.  What she discovers at Aunt Mary's is more than just an aunt she had been told had died years earlier.  She discovers a plot to eliminate the remaining Boleyns and their supporters.  She must discover who is behind the plot and why before she becomes a victim.<br />As in any fictional story, the reader is asked to suspend belief for a brief period in order to enjoy the story.  However, Ms. Harper not only asks her readers to suspend belief, but to disregard any knowledge of Tudor history as well.  While it may have been feasible for Elizabeth to escape the ever-vigilant Sir Thomas once for a few hours, the reader is asked to believe that Elizabeth made three or four escapes - two of which lasted not for a few hours, but for a few days.<br />Assuming the reader can get beyond Elizabeth being absent from Sir Thomas' care for a couple of days while she dashes across the countryside dressed as a boy, the story is a good read.  Ms. Harper is particularly successful at showing Elizabeth's dilemma of naturally wanting to act as a future queen while at the same time aware that her every action is reported to Queen Mary and too queenly action on Elizabeth's part will not be greeted as good news by Queen Mary.<br />For those readers who pay attention to such things, Ms. Harper is particularly enamored of having Elizabeth's stomach doing somersaults on every other page.  It got tiresome after the third or fourth time of Elizabeth, when confronted by even the merest danger, has her stomach clench, somersault, etc.  It will be a wonder if she doesn't develop ulcers in the next entry in this series.<br />Ms. Harper has chosen a particularly difficult character, Elizabeth, as her protagonist.

Sir Geoffrey has, over the course of the years he's been in Jerusalem, become disillusioned with his fellow knights, his liege lord, the Crusades, and life in general.<br />As he returns from a reconnaissance trip into the desert, he arrives upon the scene of a murder of a fellow knight shortly after the body is discovered.  The woman who stands screaming in the street has the murder weapon in her hand.  Because this is the second murder of a knight using a knife, he decides he must take her to the citadel for questioning.  This causes a near riot by the woman's neighbors who, along with the other citizens of Jerusalem, have no love for the Crusaders.  Within a day, his life becomes complicated beyond his wildest imagination after yet another body is found murdered in the same manner, he is asked to investigate the murders by his liege lord and his lord's competitor who swears him to secrecy. As he begins his investigation with his companions, Sir Roger and Sir Hugh (who does not want to be actively involved, but agrees to voice his opinions - wanted or not), more bodies are found, he almost loses his life, nothing is as it seems, and he begins to suspect everyone.<br />Beaufort has written an excellent debut historical mystery.  So well written is this story that you feel the heat rising from the dusty dirt streets of Jerusalem and smell the particularly odiferous stink coming from a local butcher's store.  Sir Geoffrey is a well-drawn character whom the reader comes to like and admire while the supporting cast is equally well drawn.  The reader is involved from page one to the end.  The reader will find herself hoping that Beaufort writes fast so that the second installment of this series arrives very soon.	2001-05-17

In this outing, person or persons unknown are killing prostitutes in Covent Garden.  The Bow Street Runners (the forerunners of the modern-day Bobbys) arrive just after the murder and quickly become frustrated with the lack of witnesses and suspects.  As the story progresses, suspects abound, but in the end, it is Jeremy who catches the murderer.<br />This series continues to excel in several key areas.  Alexander spins tales with enough twists to satisfy even the most able among us at solving the mystery.  He is so skillful a storyteller that the reader is transported to the squalor and filth of 1770s London.  No fancy houses and servants for this series.  Alexander's stories are about the every-day lives of people in the lower echelons of society.  While Sir John remains, for the most part, just as we met him in Blind Justice, the first book in the series, Jeremy has been developed over the course of the series so that the reader comes to like the teenager for who he is.  Alexander's history never overshadows his characters or story, but the reader always has a sense of the place and time.<br />An excellent series that continues to get better with each entry.	2001-05-17

As a gesture of goodwill toward the English people, he has emptied the prisons to show his compassion.  Shortly thereafter, there is a heinous murder of a nun at an abbey supported by the king's mother Eleanor of Aquitaine.  Eleanor and Richard fear that the king's act of compassion may backfire if the people believe that the murder was committed by a recently released felon. Richard appoints Sir Josse d'Acquin to investigate and solve the murder.  Sir Josse begins his investigation in a town near the Hawkenlye Abbey, Tonnbridge.  At the Abbey, he joins forces with the Abbess Helewise to determine who the murderer is.  But before they can do that a second nun is found murdered.<br />Clare has written a carefully plotted mystery with a denouement that may surprise.  Her history seems sound and she has a feel for the times.  However, for those of you who would prefer few if any modern intrusions into their historical mysteries, Clare slipped on more than one occasion and written a decidedly 20th century sentence.  In addition, the author would have benefitted from a stronger editor to avoid sentences like,\\"There were more of the straw pallets, but these ones were rolled up and tied neatly . . . .\\"  Perhaps the next book in this planned series will have an editor who will assist Clare in both her writing and the choice of language.  In the meantime, Clare's book is a good read, and a nice addition to the world of historical mystery.	2001-05-17

When a family and their servants are killed in their home in the Surrey countryside, Detective Inspector John Madden of Scotland Yard is assigned the task of finding the killer(s).  The entire country is shocked at the multiple murders, a virtually unknown event at the time.  Madden is baffled because he can't find a motive, the murderer left no clues at the scene and the press and his superiors are pressing for a quick arrest.  With painstaking attention to every detail, Madden, slowly, but surely, begins to unravel the mystery of who killed the family.  As the investigation proceeds, Madden has a sense of urgency because he becomes convinced that the killer(s) will kill again and soon.<br />This is an excellent read, even for those who don't care for procedurals as being too slow moving, because you'll find yourself staying up late to finish just one more chapter.  Madden is a very interesting character - flawed because of his experiences during the Great War - but not so flawed as to be insensitive in either his investigation or his relationship with the other characters in the book.  The plot is ever changing with several interesting twists and turns.  While the history is present, it is not the main thrust of the story - the solving of the multiple murders before the killer(s) kill again is the story here.  There are two engaging minor characters - Constable Billy Styles, assigned to his first murder investigation, and Helen Blackwell, the local doctor who is called in to verify that the family is dead.  There is some talk that this is the first in a trilogy featuring these characters.  One can only hope this is true.	2001-05-17

In this outing, Lord Meren continues his search for the murderer of Tutankhamun's sister-in-law, Queen Nefertiti. He must, however, conduct his search in complete secrecy because the Queen had been married to the heretic Pharoah Akenaten whose reign was disastrous to the people, the land, and the royal family. Lord Meren dares not make public his knowledge and suspicions lest he disturb the peace and prosperity of the current Pharoah's reign. As Lord Meren gathers evidence, he is foiled at every turn by the person responsible for the Queen's death. Indeed, his very life is threatened the nearer he moves toward the truth.<br />This is, by far, the best entry in this excellent series. The story is in two voices - Lord Meren's and Queen Nefertiti's. As the reader is given insights into Queen Nefertiti's life as the Pharoah's &quot;beautiful one,&quot; Lord Meren is seeking clues to who her killer is. The story moves quickly despite the two different times and voices. As in the past, Robinson's research and knowledge provides the historical setting while her imagination provides the danger.	2001-05-16

In this outing, Ursula, a lady-in-waiting to Elizabeth I, is hired by Robert Cecil to determine whether the Mason family is involved in a plot to overthrow the Queen. She is required to become a sewing and dance tutor to the Mason's unruly children, pick the locks on Mason's desk to read his correspondence, and report back to Cecil.<br />By the middle of the book, the reader no longer cares, if she ever did, whether the Masons are involved in a plot or whether Ursula succeeds one way or the other. The author is incapable of moving the story along at any pace other than a snail's pace leaving the reader's mind to wander to other books waiting to be read. Ursula is not a sympathetic character, rather she is whining, self-centered, and in the wrong business. While she's trying to prove or disprove the Masons' involvement in an attempt to overthrow the Queen, she whines about not being with her husband who is in exile in France for the same offense. Finally, Ursula, it seems, can be placed in any time period and be perfectly happy. The reader, on the other hand, will not be.<br />I really wanted to like this series because I love the Elizabethan period.  But even the setting couldn't save this series for me. I was not enthusiastic about the first book in this series, To Shield the Queen, but decided to give the author and Ursula a second chance because I am particularly fond of the Elizabethan period. There will be no third chance.	2001-05-16

Hilda works as a maid in the home of one of South Bend's scions. As she is returning from a day spent with her friend, Patrick, they discover the body of the sister of the next door neighbor, Judge Harper, in the bushes. Hilda knows that the police will not try to find the real killer, but will take the easy route and try to pin the blame on a fellow immigrant. She wants to prevent this, and begins investigating the murder herself with the help of Patrick, her sister, and fellow servants.<br />Dams has written a very good historical mystery. It will, however, anger some purists because she gave no clear-cut clues as to who the real killer was. That is less a problem than Hilda's obsession with saving a police suspect - she continually puts not only her job in jeopardy, but the jobs of those helping her - this after saying how difficult it would be to obtain another position if she were dismissed from the one she has. Her obsession makes no real sense, does not advance the story, and has little to do with the plot.<br />Dams' has a real talent for capturing the cadence of the characters' speech. The reader will find that Patrick's Irish lilt begins ringing in her head whenever he speaks and Hilda's English takes on the rhythm of her native language. The setting, while unusual, does not overwhelm the story nor does the history that Dams imparts. If you do not like Dams' other series featuring Dorothy Martin and have been reluctant to read this one, try this one, you'll be pleasantly surprised.	2001-05-16

Initially believing that she was a woman of the streets who froze to death on her way home, the police are disposed to dismiss the death as accidental. However, they soon discover that while there was no alcohol in her bloodstream there was opium and other indicators that have them believing that she was murdered. Detective William Murdoch is assigned the task of not only finding out who murdered her, but who she is as well.<br />This is a police procedural in the truest sense. We watch as Murdoch painstakingly follows one tidbit to the next. For each question he thinks he's answered two more arise in his mind. As we go along, we are introduced to many players any one of whom could be the murderer.<br />Jennings was very clever in her writing of this procedural. While the reader quickly suspects various characters, Murdoch remains an innocent - willing to suspect someone, but not willing to believe with no proof. The bits of proof are doled out slowly - as slowly as it takes Murdoch to discover them.  When all the puzzle pieces finally come together, the furtiveness of several characters is adequately explained, the choice of murderer makes sense, and there is relief that that the book has finally ended. The book moves slowly, sometimes bordering on tediousness, and the temptation is to set it aside for a faster read, but resist that temptation. As Murdoch pieces the puzzle together, the book picks up speed so that it may seem like Jennings has rushed the ending, but the way she has handled it, it makes sense for this book.	2001-05-16

It features ronin Matsuyama Kaze, a freelance samurai, in 1603 Japan.  Kaze is on a quest to find the child of his former master.  He is following one small lead after another with dwindling hope of finding the child he has been looking for during the proceeding two years.  On his way to his next destination, he comes across a charcoal gatherer who is examining the dead body of a merchant.  In spite of himself, Kaze stays around to see what happens and finds himself embroiled in the small town's politics and rivalries as he attempts to unravel the mystery of who killed the merchant and why.<br />Furutani's writing is lyrical and the reader finds himself enveloped in a cadence that transports the reader to medieval Japan.  Like all first books in series, this one must not only develop the character's personality, but provide us with a mystery and a story as well.  The latter is no mean feat in and of itself, but Furutani accomplishes the task with ease.  Furutani does not set flaunt his research by using every bit of minutiae he picked up, but, rather, he uses it subtly to advance his story and, in the process, educate his readers.  For those who, like myself, do not care for Furutani's previous books, be rest assured that the writing here as well as the characters are a very welcome change.  The uniqueness of the setting adds to quality of this book.	2001-05-16

From the opening scene of Sano's arranged marriage to the denouement, this outing leaves a flat aftertaste. Sano's bride, Hirata, has a penchant for investigation and she sets out to find the murderer of Harume, the pregnant favorite of the ruling Shogun. Sadly, the relationship between Sano and Reiko reads like a bad romance novel, complete with fiery tempers, illogical misunderstandings, and the requisite revealing of the killer.  T his outing should come with a strong warning for those readers who do not like graphic sex in their mysteries.<br />Rowland appears to have done her research, but unfortunately used it all in this book. Perhaps because of her concentration on the history, she paid less attention to developing her characters because they remain cardboard-flat and the dialogue overly dramatic.<br />This was a disappointing entry in an otherwise enjoyable series.	2001-05-16

In this outing, we are taken to the coal mines where strikesare being called to try to improve working conditions.  When a body is found deep in a mine shaft of an already-closed mine, County Detective Milo Kachigan is called to investigate the murder. The body, wedged behind some mine machinery, has a stiletto in its back indicating that the murder may have been committed by the Black Hand gang.  However, Milo knows that it doesn't make sense that the Black Hand would murder someone in the mine.  It is not their modus operandi.  As he digs deeper, Kachigan discovers that there may have been blackmail, extortion, and all kinds of nefarious deeds going on.  In the meantime, Helen Sorby has been asked to locate the daughter of a coal baron who disappeared at the same time valuable securities were stolen from her father.  Is there a connection between Kachigan's case and the missing heiress?  Sorby and Kachigan decide to combine forces to solve both mysteries.<br />Cercone's debut, Steel Ashes, was a wonderful addition to the historical mystery genre.  However, she stumbled a bit with the second book, Blood Tracks.  But she is right back on track with this outing.  Her writing is such that, as the characters descend into the mines, you can almost feel the weight of the earth closing in on you and feel the choking coal dust permeating your clothing and seeping into your lungs.  In a neat role reversal, Kachigan wants to marry Sorby, but Sorby (who has been married before) refuses, but wants to sleep with Kachigan who is offended by the offer and refuses.  There is more humor, albeit subtle, in this book as well.  This is a real page turner and the reader will be hard pressed to set the book aside.  Cercone deserves a large following for this series.	2001-05-16

In this outing, an aging anarchist tests out one of his bombs in the settlement house's back yard.  What appears when the smoke settles is a dead body.  However, it is clear to Helen that the man was not killed in the bomb blast.  She also knows that the police will take the easiest way out and arrest her anarchist-boarder for the death.  To ensure that the murder is investigated by the only honest policeman she knows, she gets herself arrested as well.  True to form, Milo gets himself assigned to the case and bails Helen out, but leaves the anarchist in jail.  He makes Helen promise not to interfere with his investigation and she, surprisingly, agrees as long as he promises not to interfere with hers.  They go their separate ways, each turning up important pieces of the puzzle.<br />In this outing, Helen and Milo seem more antagonistic than in the first.  Helen has become, in many ways, shrewish.  It is a disappointment because the first book showed much promise of a series with a strong woman and a strong man operating on as equal terms as the times allowed.  The writing remains strong with Cercone using Pittsburgh to provide us a history of the times.  She does not let her history overwhelm the story or the characters, and uses real people, like George Westinghouse, in a believable way.	2001-05-16

When she retires, she and an acquaintance open an antique store in San Antonio, Texas. Several things do not ring true in this book; for instance, the first thing she does after retiring is to put rainbow stickers on her beemer.  I would think that it would take more than a day to undo the 20 years discipline of being in the closet.  Other things bothered me as well.  She was madly in love with her best friend's lover, and valiantly stayed away from her for the longest time.  But then she was over her immediately upon finding her best friend's other love interest intriguing.  The book could also stand a good editor.  There were misspelled words, words that were soooo overused, and instances where the writer and editor forgot what had been written a page earlier (for instance, Marcel was eating fajitas and on the next page, but at the same meal, she was eating tacos).  Those are the kinds of things that detract from a book.  .  I'm still wondering where the title for the book came from, but that was the least of my problems with this book.  This is a fluff piece that has little plot, characters that have potential, but who are not realized, and an ending so predictable that one wonders why one wasted the couple of hours it took to read the book.	2001-05-14

She called in to investigate the murder of a professional golfer at Australia's premiere women's golf tournament.  As Bourke, Ashton's associate, says, &quot;We have a victim who has more enemies than friends, a suspect list that's growing, and a wide-open time of death, so that practically everyone seems to have had the opportunity to do murder.&quot;  But Ashton and her team painstakingly investigate each clue as it's presented to them until Ashton finally figures out who committed murder.  I was pretty smug because I had it figured out who the murderer was about half way through.  I remained smug right up to the moment Ashton revealed who the real murderer was - and, of course, McNab had not tricked me at all - she had only written a villanous character who I was willing to lay the murder on.  McNab got off course a few books back, but she's back on course and writing good procedurals.

The Whigs are the political party in power having convinced George that the Tories support the Pretender.  Gideon Viscount St. Mars has returned from his three-year Grand Tour of the continent and fallen in love with Isabella Mayfield - a woman his father believes to be far beneath his son.  Shortly after arguing violently with his father about his intentions to marry Isabella, his father is killed.  St. Mars is, of course, the prime suspect because everyone in his father's house heard him arguing with his father.  St. Mars is seriously wounded by an unknown assailant on his way to a ball that very evening - a damning incident in that his father's dying words were that he had wounded his assailant.  It is as if all the world conspires to prove that St. Mars murdered his father - all but his faithful servants and Mrs. Hester Kean, Isabella's cousin.<br />I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did - the author is a well-known Romance writer - and I've never been a Romance reader.  However, I was immediately hooked by the mystery of who killed St. Mars' father.  Wynn has written a Romance novel with an excellent mystery interwoven throughout.  The pace of the book could have used a boost to its speed, but other than that, it is well written.  St. Mars and Mrs. Kean are excellently drawn and immediately likable.  Even Isabella who is an eighteenth century air head becomes likable as the book draws to an end.  And Isabella's scheming mother, while not likable, is certainly well drawn.<br />The mystery is a good mystery as there is no scarcity of suspects, each with a motive to do murder, and the individual actually guilty of the deed is introduced early enough to not be a surprise when he is uncovered as the murderer.  The history appears to be right on the money - Wynn introduces enough period history, i.e., the rivalry between the Whigs and Tories for George's largesse, to be interesting but not to become the focus of the book, which always remains the mystery of who did the murder.between the Whigs and Tories for George's largesse, to be interesting but not to become the focus of the book, which always remains the mystery of who did the murder.	2001-04-14

Hoffman raises money for his premature baby hospital and research by exhibiting the tiny babies in glass incubators to the public at fairs.<br />By nightfall, the young man is dead outside a tavern on the fair grounds, the baby is safely ensconced in an incubator with filtered oxygen, and we are introduced to the characters next door to the hospital - Caro, the stripper/dancer and her dwarf-like cousin, St. Louis, who acts as a body guard.<br />The characters are interesting and the story moves along after the slow start until the last dozen pages when the story takes an odd and inexplicable turn that leaves you feeling like something important flashed by without you noticing it.  But Brown's writing shows great promise and her next book should be an interesting one as well.	2001-04-14

This ragtag bunch plans to sabotage the bridge by blowing it up on May 31, 1882 at 4:00 pm - the day it opens and the time it will be most loaded with sightseers.  One slightly corrupt policeman, in the crush of a corrupt police force, races to follow the clues from a seemingly random corpse outside a tavern to, finally, the Confederates before they blow the bridge.<br />I got through this book only because I couldn't believe that it wasn't going to get better.  Normally, I give any book at least 50 pages (so many books, so little time). Call me an optimist as I waded through 436 pages of poor dialogue, characters so thin as to be invisible and a jerky style rather like riding in an old stick-shift truck with no shocks and a novice driver. Why, you ask?  Because the book came highly recommended by someone who normally mirrors my taste for historicals, because others have read the book and found it wonderful. Call me newly cautious about others' recommendations.	2001-04-03

Having devoured everything else she has written, I didn't hesitate to pick this up.  Well, get ready to be smacked hard upside your head every single day.<br />The author seems to have the view of a seer, and every single piece is directly related to what's happening in life at exactly that moment.  Each devotion ends with the phrase, \\"Until today...\\" and a statement like \\"you may have been feeling as if you were about to break down.  Just for today, call forth the strength, courage, wisdom, insight, power and love of the spirit of life.  Ask that you be guided through the next minute, hour or day to a place of peace.\\"  (January 31)<br />Each month has a focus - life, love, awareness, acknowledgment, acceptance forgiveness, etc.  Each day's reading focuses on internal personal and spiritual growth, self-acceptance, change and producing peace in your life.<br />It is an excellent book for those who have thrown out all the other daily devotional books including those for &quot;Women Who Do Too Much.&quot;  I expect to wear the pages of this book out over the next years.	2001-04-02

He is continues to make the best of a bad situation.  As summer ends, there is a rash of killings seemingly unrelated - too far apart, weapons not the same, etc.  But, then again, maybe it is the same killer and if it is, Liam's got a serial killer loose in the Bush.  Stabenow takes us through each step of the investigation and while she's at it transports us to the Alaskan Bush.  This is a well written plot with intelligent, believable characters, a well-plotted mystery, and a satisfying ending.  Only a handful of writer write as well as or better than Stabenow!	2001-03-31

However, this outing, the 12th in the series, was less.  Lt. Dallas is still one of the best cops in procedural-land, and her relationship with Roarke is still one of the best in mystery-land.  But this time, the story line didn't have the punch the previous 11 did.  There is an assasin loose in New York City, and when he begins assasinating people tied to Roarke, Dallas takes it personally.  She is about to close in on the killer, but is thwarted by federal interference and so must begin the search all over as the assasin dives for cover.  Who is the assasin's real target?  Roarke?  Dallas? Or someone as close to them - Mavis?  Sommerset?  From the story line, this should be a humdinger.  But the writing isn't as tight, as punchy.  If memory serves, this is the longest of the series, and the padding doesn't add much to the mystery.  There's no doubt that I will read the next book (due in September), but if it fails to reach the standards set by the first 11 books, my interest will wain.  There are just too many good mysteries on the market today to waste time with a series gone bad.	2001-03-21

It doesn't take Rios long before he believes, like everyone else, that his client is guilty.  The young man maintains his innocence, but he's got a problem.  He can't remember how the murder weapon got in his hand. Michael Nava writes a good mystery - no doubt about it.  But.  And this is a big but, Nava has a tendency to create the same characters for each book - the accused is always a young, good looking gay man, the murderer is always the same nasty from book to book as well.  With the exception of Rios, the characters are nearly charactures of gay men and cardboard ones at that.  In Goldenboy, Rios meets a witness, Josh - a young 22-year-old who worked in the same restaurant as the accused and victim - against his client, knows he's lying about something, and then the trial takes a twist.  The next time he meets this witness, he decides he's in love.  Nava just can't seem to get it down well enough to make any relationship that Rios enters into seem as intense as he would like us to believe. Rios is very good about piecing together bits of evidence and Nava expects the reader to take the same leaps of faith that Rios does, and it's not always possible to leap with Rios.  And Nava cheats in that someone provides Rios with important information that Nava doesn't share with his readers.  Every time I've picked up a Nava book, I want to like it so much and every time I'm disappointed.	2001-03-11

Not exactly her idea of good time, but she's trying to mend fences with her lover Kip.  When the opportunity arises for to accept an investigation into a murder ruled a suicide, she doesn't hesitate.  Perhaps she should have.  As Laurano investigates and discovers each new layer, things get uglier and uglier and even include an attempt on her life.  She calls on Cecchi, a former NYPD detective with whom she is going to go into partnership, to help solve the murder.  Kip, in the meantime, is still punishing her for an affair she had in the previous book.  This has it all - good writing, a multi-layered plot, and good characterizations.  Scoppettone is back in form!  She has, unfortunately, also said that this is the last Lauren Laurano book - &quot;I've said all I can about Lauren, Kip, and especially New York City.&quot;  That's too bad.

In this outing, a nanny has been murdered at the home of Olivia's friends.  Her tenant Harry Melville has been hired to investigate the murder and Olivia volunteers to assist.  As they begin asking questions, the responses raise more questions than they answer.  This is an excellent series.  The characters are well-drawn and interesting, the reader genuinely cares about Olivia and Harry as well as the minor characters.  Meyers makes you feel the angst of the young men who survived WWI and Greenwich Village comes alive beneath her talented pen. The plot in this outing was more strongly drawn than in the previous entry in the series.  The only problem I have with the series is that I have to wait a year for the next entry.	2001-02-20

When an actor in a new proudction at the New Globe Theater in New York is murdered, Eve must investigate.  She has a theater-full of witnesses including herself and her husband.  As she slowly and painstakenly shifts through the clues, she closes in on the murderer. This is an excellent procedural with strongly written characters that from the first outing capture your attention.  In the skilled hands of Robb, the pseudonym of a well-known writer, even the minor characters come alive.  This series deserves a wide audience because each entry is one of those call-in-sick-to-work books that you just can't put down.  The series should be read in order in order to get all the background on Eve and the other characters as well as to watch the author develop the characters and place over the course of several books.	2001-02-17

This is a fine series with strongly written characters - even the minor ones - and good plots.  It really deserves a wider audience than it seems to have.  The series should be read in order so the reader gets to know the characters and watch the author, a well-known writer using a pseudonym, develop the characters.	2001-02-17

Soon after arriving in town, the doctor and his nurse are killed.  Then her new boyfriend arrives.  And the chaos of a wedding continues around her as she investigates the murders.  This series started out as an excellent, if very dark, cozy series. Lily was piecing her life back together, had become self-sufficient, and was recovering. Then, for whatever reason, the author seemed to rethink her main character and quickly evolved her into someone less attractive - less strong, less angry, just less.  The author continues this trend in this entry, and this reader will not be reading any more Lily Bards.  That's a shame because as Lily was originally drawn, she could have found a place in the same niche as Carol O'Connell's Mallory.  Now she's just another cleaning lady in another cozy.	2001-02-12

To add to her misery, her relationship seems to be falling apart, and there's seemingly nothing she can do to stop it.  This began as excellent series, deteriorated into the doldrums of a so-so series, and with this entry, has come full circle. The writer evokes the Village so we know how the wet streets feel, her characters are well drawn and likable to the point that the reader finds herself hoping Lauren's relationship with Kip can be saved. Normally, I recommend a reader read a series in order if new to it, but I wouldn't subject any reader to the mediocre middle entries in this series.	2001-02-12

In this outing, a skeleton is found buried on the beach.  Detective Merry Folger takes this as a personal affront since it's her territory and dead bodies, even if they are old, shouldn't be turning up on her beaches.  The only thing the crime lab can tell Merry is that the skeleton is a woman who was strangled between two and ten years earlier.  Not much to go on, but something.  This series is as cozy as they come and deserves a wide audience of cozy readers.  Suprisingly, non-cozy lovers can enjoy this series because it is also an excellent procedural - especially since Merry doesn't have access to many experts like city cops do, and must solve the crimes on her island with brains and deduction.	2001-02-12

Fansler plays only a minor role, a transition role if you will, while familiarizing us with Woody.  She accepts a case from some of the English Department faculty at a small New Jersey college, Clifton College.  The head of the Lit Department has been murdered, and the faculty wants Woody to find out who - not so much because they care about the man, but to remove suspicion from themselves.  But Woody quickly finds out that everyone, including his family, hated the deceased man, and everyone had a motive and the means. I am not sure that I believe that the detective assigned the case would be as cooperative as portrayed here, but I am willing to give Cross the benefit of the doubt. Cross ties up loose ends in the last dozen pages with a very unsatisfactory ending - as if she had gotten that far and could not figure out how to end the book.  The book is well written - no doubt about that - although the reader is told, a few too many times for my taste, that Woody is fat, but other than that, this is a well-written book with a lousy ending	2001-02-11

I like a story that gets to the point, but Oates tangles the story up in needless details on every page.  When a character enters the barn, you have to wade through three pages about when the barn was built and what the mother has stored in it since she got into antiques and how a child got to bid on a termite-infested rocking horse in an auction.  Details are important to a story.  There have to be enough to visualize the place and people and to believe the plot.  I found none of these in this story.<br />The Mulvaneys own beautiful acreage called High Point Farm.  The father has a prosperous business, the parents are well respected, members of the Country Club and solid citizens.  Their four children are nothing short of perfect.  The oldest is the star football player, the next excels in academics, and the daughter is popular enough to be a prom princess and a cheerleader.  The youngest child is Judd, the primary voice in the story.  It is through 14-year-old Judd's eyes that we most clearly see the family blown apart when his sister, Marianne, is raped the night of the school prom.  From that moment forward, the Mulvaneys seem to be caught in a whirlpool of pain, exile, and misery that ends only after a tragedy occurs.<br />Michael Mulvaney senior is unable to cope with the rape of his daughter and unable to control his rage and depression over her unwillingness to press charges.  She is sent away to live with a relative because he can't stand to look at her.  One by one the other children move out or on to college, all internalizing the anger their father felt.<br />The story is a moving one.  The characters are interesting and three dimensional if somewhat off balance and in serious need of counseling.  If Oates could just control the need to provide so much unnecessary detail, the story would flow better and the reader be more willing to read to the end.be more willing to read to the end.	2001-02-09

And, when a writer's strike against the newspaper he works for in Detroit stretches into weeks, Mitch flies to Boston every Tuesday to see Morrie.<br />He finds Morrie both changed and unchanged.  Morrie now sees life through the hourglass of lost abilities, trying to make peace with and find some humor in the fact that soon he will need someone to wipe his butt.  Each week, Mitch sees the not-so-subtle deterioration of the human physical condition and finds learning and solace in the words of his teacher.<br />Don't expect a story of a saint dying.  Morrie is, by degrees, angry, depressed, and above al, exhausted.  Mitch is simply a recorder, but not a silent one.  I grew tired of his self-obsession and focus on money and work.  Being with Morrie is only a convenience because he can not work until the strike is over.  One doubts that Mitch would have made more than a single visit to his friend if he were living his \\"regular\\" life.<br />That said, the author is to be commended for recording the last months of Morrie's life in a way that is uplifting as well as serious.	2001-02-09

Jackie is a doctor who does not want to leave the small town in Maine where she practices even when her lover Dana comes home and announces that they're moving to Greece for three years.  What ensues is a hodgepodge of events loosely tied together.  This book is in serious need of a very good editor - for instance, early in the book two characters are standing in a kitchen and the conversation continues, but the characters have somehow magically transported themselves to a hiking trail - huh?  That kind of lapse in both writing and editing causes the reader to re-read paragraphs to try to figure out if she missed something.  You never get a sense of who these women are - you might like them all if only the author was capable of anything resembling drawing a  character.  Even the descriptions of the characters are woeful - for instance, it's not until near the end of the book that you're told that Jackie is in her 50s (but, of course, looks younger).  Throughout the book, every character has met the love of her life, but is easily persuaded to forget her in a blink of an eye.  The clich&eacute;s fly fast and furious throughout.  This is one of those books that you wonder why the publisher wasted the paper. If you're looking for a good romance, skip this one.

Benjamin is a former Jew, having changed his name and become adept at returning stolen property to its rightful owner.<br />Benjamin's world is turned upside down when he accepts a request to retrieve a packet of letters from Kate Cole, a prostitute.  Everyone Benjamin encounters from this point on is curiously bound to the deaths of his stock-jobber father and a rich associate.  The story unfolds slowly, in layers, as Benjamin follows a meager trail of clues through both the Jewish and established-rich communities of 18th century London.<br />The plot is clever and the pace picks up in the last third of the novel.  Just as you think you know what happened, you learn that you know absolutely nothing.  This is a gorgeous first book full of excellent, but not overwhelming, detail.  The historical perspective of London during the birth of the stock market and national banking intrigues the reader as it winds around religious separatism and corrupt government.	2001-01-29

This book is for us.  Reorgs can be unsettling at best, at worst they will bring out the worst in us.  This book helps you put a name to the type of person you are when it comes to change.  That, in turn, helps you to face the change and deal with it in a more acceptable fashion.  It is a short book and can/should be read in a single sitting.  It is not like those business books where the author is full of himself and thinks only he can see the truth.  This book is talking about universals - how we react to changes and how we can deal with not being in control of those changes (you know management never asks the folks in the trenches what they think of the changes they've come up with).	2001-01-24

Her mentor summons her to his house to witness his will in which he gives her Center his extensive book collection and his house to his daughter.  When a portion of the collection is stolen from her truck, Claire sets out to recover the books, find out who stole the books since only a handful of people knew she had them, and why anyone would want to steal them in the first place.  There isn't much mystery here, but there is tons of atmosphere.  Van Gieson's New Mexico comes alive with her skillful pen - you can almost smell the creosote smoke in the air.  However, this slim book moves along at a very leisurely pace so if you like the kind of mysteries with lots of twists and turns and a mad dash to the denouement, this is not the book for you.  If you like your mysteries in the cozy genre, grab this book up.	2001-01-06

After the far-right took over about half the country subsequent to a deadly and particulary virulent virus attacked the citenzry, women established Freeland - mainly in the western part of what had been the US.  This is the tale of the rebuilding of Isis after the men of Elysia attacked and destroyed it and the women and children who lived there.  All the characters from the first book return as the rebuilding gets under way.  But someone is sabotaging their efforts, and things get particularly nasty as the election for the leaders of the city near.  I thought the first book in this series was excellent.  I wish I could say the same for this one.  It lacks the punch of the first book.  It's as if the author has mellowed the characters almost to vanilla yogurt.  There doesn't seem to be the high-wire tension of the first book; and the author tried to make the building and election carry the book rather than the women characters.  This book was a disappointment, but I can't wait to read the third (and final?) entry in this futuristic story of a women-only society.	2001-01-01

A. \\"Frank\\" Franco is introduced here as she seeks the killer of a young girl.  She eventually ties in nine rapes and four murders to the perpetrator. Franco is meticulous and thorough as she shifts through the few clues she has.  The author painstakingly puts us into the mind of both the perpetrator and Franco.  This is police procedural at its best.  The characterizations are such that the reader cares about the main characters even the closed-off Franco.  There are several minor characters that the author manages to fully flesh out as well although Franco's squad members are, at times, hard to identify because of her use of their nicknames - a minor flaw at best.  This author deserves a wide audience.  Let's hope the author and her publisher gives us more of Baxter Clare and Lt. Franco.	2000-12-25

The author has gotten stale in her last few outings, Ashton seems locked into a relationship that doesn't give her much satisfaction, but she can't seem to let go of it either.

The beautiful and strong vampire, Lestat finds himself stalked by someone or something terrifying and sinister.  The shadowy figure is Memnoch, an archangel evicted from heaven when he challenged God's indifference to the suffering of humanity.  Memnoch is horrified by the anguish and pain of the human condition.<br />Rice cleverly has Memnoch seek out Lestat and it is their conversations that make up the bulk of the story.  Memnoch takes Lestat through a verbal history of heaven and hell and leaves the reader bowled over by the sheer courage of Rice's writing.  She has created a vision of creation and salvation with such lucidity and power that I thought about the book long after I read the last page.  This is the strength of this book.  It leaves you pondering our existence, the prophecies of the Bible, and the strength of Satan.<br />The dialogue is beautifully written, Lestat's character continues to be fleshed out and Rice pushes the boundaries of fiction and religion.  The indifferent God is such a plausible one that I felt some relief.  If humanity is completely responsible for what happens to them, it is much more reassuring than the image of a benevolent God who picks and chooses who will have an easy life and who will face repeated tragedies and hardships.	2000-12-24

He's a marvelously interesting character with two centuries of life under his belt.  I think that this is the best book in the series.<br />The author's writing is at its best in this modern-day setting for a depressed and miserable Lestat who has grown tired and bored with the immortal life.  His depression climaxes when he flies into the bright sun of the Gobi desert in a desperate attempt at suicide, but Lestat underestimates his vampiric power.  The result of this mad attempt is skin with a bronze glow to it and the ability to walk among the living in daylight.<br />Ragland James approaches Lestat to make an irresistible offer.  James knows the secrets of the Talamasca and Lestat, having recently been booted out of the order for conduct unbecoming to one who carries the secrets of the undead.  James offers to switch bodies with Lestat for two days so Lestat can relive what he's been missing.  The spoiled, self-centered Lestat takes him up on the offer only to be reminded of the misery of being human.  Illness lands him in the hospital almost immediately.  Lestat quickly realizes the stupidity of the switch as he re-experiences hunger, fatigue and illness.  Worse, the two days pass and James doesn't return with Lestat's beautiful and strong body.<br />This is a beautifully plotted and written book..  The entire book is an exhilarating literary rush and I dropped everything I was doing to read it in a single sitting.  When evening came and I closed the book, I had been transported for the day as surely as James had for his time as a vampire.	2000-12-24

One ends up being sad for the murder victim, not because she is murdered, but because no one in her life was who they seemed to be.<br />The historical details and characters were just interesting enough to make the short, choppy sentences tolerable.  But, when the denouement takes place and the murderer revealed, I felt swindled.  After two hundred pages of ragged clues, including a severed thumb removed from the corpse after it was buried and the failed reconstruction of the deceased's father's appointment book, the author pulls the murderer out of thin air in the last chapter.<br />A good editor could have created a decent book from the author's messy manuscript.  The plot has merit, but the author does not have the skill to create three-dimensional characters with consistent traits and motivations or even a victim that the reader wants to see vindicated.  I was left wondering why I kept reading after my usual litmus test of 60 pages.	2000-12-24

Bronwen works as a Union spy sent deep into Southern territory to gather information on the movement of the Confederate army.  Her sister, Kathryn, is a nurse who is turned away by Dorthea Dix for being too young and too pretty in spite of her nursing experience.  Kathryn finds herself in jeopardy when she says farewell to her sister at the Union dock, but is saved by a Union doctor, a man she finds utterly infuriating.<br />From a historical perspective, the book is a wonderful read.  Monfredo's attention to detail is as sharp as ever.  However, both Kathryn and Bronwen are irritatingly reckless and obtuse to the dangers around them.  Bronwen is especially reckless, a trait that would seem to greatly reduce the longevity of a spy.  Her tendency to be hotheaded quickly grew old.<br />Sisters of Cain has inspired me to learn more about the ironclad ships launched in the Civil War, but the female characters are the difficult types one usually finds in a romance novel, not populating Monfredo's work.  The writing and plot are thoroughly engaging, so I hope the characters will mature in this new series.	2000-12-24

Miki Jamieson is a Maine Forest Ranger who is assigned, at the request of the governor, to investigate the harassment of Christina Reynolds, a refugee from Boston to her family?s Maine residence.  The problem is that the residents of Bailey?s Cove use the Reynolds property as a shortcut to the local lake, a privilege Christina has made clear must stop. Is the harassment just childish pranks to get back at Christina or do the pranks have a more sinister meaning?  It is up to Miki to investigate and stop the pranks regardless of why they are occurring.  During the course of the investigation, Miki finds herself powerfully attracted to Christina.  The author leaves some loose ends dangling unanswered.  For instance, she hints that Christina has run away from Boston because of an unhappy past ? but never tells us what the past is and the author tells us that a phone call from Christina ? not once, but twice ? results in the governor?s intervention, but never tells us why or how she wields that weight with the governor.  The author would have benefitted from a strong editor?s hand to correct misused words and misspelled words.  While this is a Naiad formula romance, it is, like others, just the thing to relax with in front of a fire after a hard day at the office	2000-12-21

This is the story of Whit, a Freeland warrior, and Amelia, a Farmer from Elysia.  Together they unlock Amelia's past and solve the mystery of who betrayed Freeland ten years earlier.  This is a well-written combination of science fiction and lesbian romance.  The characters are well drawn, the societies are clearly defined without bogging the reader down in detail, and the writer has down all this in 173 pages.

She trying to gather evidence about the disappearance of the family patriarch and his sister seven years earlier in the Outback.  As she gets closer and closer to the answer of whether the two met with a foul death or simply suffered an accident, she finds herself in increasing danger.  This is welcome addition to the author's list of books.  Agent Cleever is a likable character who does nothing rash, makes no obvious errors, but still finds herself in danger.  In addition, and perhaps, as important, this is not a formulaic lesbian romance with a little mystery thrown in.  This is a well plotted, well-written mystery featuring a lesbian as the protagonist in a genre that could use more of the same.	2000-12-16

By the time they reach the island, it is raging.  It doesn't take long for the storm to cut off telephone communication with the mainland.

Almost as disconcerting is that Tyler learns that she really doesn't even know the women she's spending the weekend with.

The author delivers yet again with Merrick, a relatively minor character in an earlier book in the Mayfair Witches series.  This novel is like meeting up with old friends again.  It is written in the beautiful and familiar voice of David Talbot, now a vampire housed in a young body stolen in a Faustian switch in The Tale of the Body Thief.  David finds himself drawn into the spell of the young witch, Merrick, he took under his tutelage at the Talamasca twenty years earlier in New Orleans.  But he underestimates the power Merrick has accumulated in her years of study in the Talamasca archives.  She is beautiful, irresistible, and supremely dangerous to the vampires of New Orleans.  The weak vampire, Louis, beloved of Lestat, has lived in misery for years believing the one vampire he fathered, Claudia, remains trapped in the darkness.  Claudia was a child of seven when Louis made her a vampire and in her permanently childish body raged the soul of a woman.  She died in the morning rays of sunlight in a horrifying slaughter at the Vampire of the Theatres a century before.  Now Louis seeks to mollify his misery by having Merrick summon the ghost of Claudia in an elaborate spell.  No one is prepared for the venom of the spirit who arrives. The plot is gorgeously designed, the writing fluid and welcoming.  It took only a few pages to be once again in the familiar and interesting company of the beautiful undead.  This is Anne Rice at her best.	2000-12-16

As supporters for funding for AIDS research are reading the names of victims, a woman interrupts the reading to shout her opposition to AIDS funding when so many women were dying of various cancers for which there was little research funding.  Alix is drawn to the woman and invites her to stay the night with her when it turns out that Sandra has no where to stay.  Sandra is angry, mysterious, and piques Alix's interest and lust.  During the next week, there is a murder, an arrest, and a confession.  Alix is also drawn to a Congresswoman's aide and spends the night with her, too.  While all this sounds interesting, even intriguing, the author was unable to make the reader care about any of the characters, from the murder victim to Alix.  They are all cardboard characters and as the book progresses, the readers indifference grows.  While I did finish reading the book, it was more because I wanted to know if the denouement was going to be as predictable as the characters were lackluster.  It is to the author's credit that there was just enough of a twist at the end to be interesting although she pulled the murderer out of nowhere and didn't play fair with the reader by providing enough clues to even suspect the murderer.  There are better written mysteries, there are better plotted mysteries, and there are more finely drawn characters in mysteries available.  But if you're starved for a lesbian protagonist and a non-Naiad-formulaic read, this just might be your cup of tea.	2000-12-14

This is another in a very long line of Naiad's formulaic publications - it hasn't varied in over two dozen years - so there were no surprises, the relationship is the same as any book published by Naiad in the last twenty-five years - different names, different occupations, and different locale, but it is the same book that Naiad always publishes.  If you've been reading Naiad books for any length of time, and like the formula, by all means buy this book.  But if you're looking for more, look elsewhere.	2000-12-11

In this eleventh outing for Inspector Banks, he is asked by his Chief Constable and nemesis to go to London to find the Chief Constable's daughter who ran away from home several months earlier.  Locating the daughter is not that difficult, even taking her back to Eastvale is easy.  But once she's home a series of events, including several murders, has Banks trying to determine who did what to whom and why. The main suspect is a man who seemingly gets away with any crime to which he puts his mind.  Banks is a fortysomething divorced man who is coming to terms with his private life and trying to get his professional life back on track as well, but whose choices that are not the best to succeed at either.  Robinson reintroduces Detective Sergeant Annie Cabbot, newly transferred to Banks' neck of the woods. As she and Banks unravel the story behind the murders, it is painstaking police work with no leaps of faith or suppressed major clues that appear later in the book and sprung upon an unsuspecting reader.  As the clues are discovered,the reader is privy to them. This is police procedural at its best and a great read that you will be loathe to put down.  Even if you don't like British procedurals, you should give this series a try.  Reading it from the beginning is best since you'll be able to see Banks grow and change from the first in the series to this one.	2000-12-10

Hours later, he is again alive, miserable, and depressed.  It seems the one thing he wants most in the world - to die - is beyond his means.  Was his resurrection a miracle or a punishment?  By book's end, you are no closer to knowing the answer.<br />A friend delivers Pilgrim to the sanitarium where Carl Jung takes over his case almost immediately.  He hands off Pilgrim's collection of journals to his wife to study and here we are introduced to the most interesting character of the book.  Elizabeth, pregnant with Carl's second son, reads the journals, which are not journals at all but loosely strung stories set throughout history.  The journals chronicle a series of lives for four millennia.  Who is Pilgrim?  Is he a fallen angel or a Roman god punished for eons for some transgression?<br />The answer darts in and out of the pages depending on who is looking for the answer.  If you like tidy endings with all the loose threads neatly tied up, this book will frustrate.  However, if you want a book to stay with you long after you've read the last page, this will be just your cup of tea.	2000-12-05

To force the priesthood to either accept her or come out against her, she asks them to convene to reach a decision.  After a suspicious murder occurs in the temple, the Pharoah asks her Chief Judge, Amerotke, to investigate and to attend the meetings.  It is well known that the priests have hired a researcher to find evidence that there has never been a woman on the throne.  As more murders occur, there is suspicion that the victims have found evidence that either there has been a woman Pharoah or there has been no woman Pharoah - depending on whether the person speculating on the murders supports Hatusu or not. Amerotke slowly pieces together the evidence that leads him to accuse the perpetrator of the foul deeds.<br /><br />Egyptian history is one of my favorite historical periods, and I looked forward to reading Doherty's take on it.  I wish now that I had waited for Lynda S. Robinson's next Lord Meren book.  The reader can not fault Doherty on his history, but he is unable  not to confuse his readers with a plethora of characters all introduced in rapid succession - so that keeping track of who was who and who was doing what to whom became a mystery in itself.<br /><br />There was not much of a story line here.  Doherty tried to hide the paucity of his mystery with sub-plots, but the fact remains that the premise on which this already thin book (had the publisher printed it in standard book form, I doubt it would have made 125 pages) rests was not enough to carry the book.<br /><br />Any reader who loves Egyptian history and wants a good mystery thrown in should read Robinson's books instead.	2000-11-30

She has also addressed a very difficult subject - rape - with sensitivity and provided a viewpoint not often seen.  Her characters are well-drawn and likable - even the minor ones.  There's little mystery, but &quot;watching&quot; the two major characters in this outing solve  the crime is fascinating.	2000-01-04

There are many suspects, including his son, Alexander, all with viable motives.<br />While the author  has chosen an era that has yet to be explored by mystery writers, she  allowed the results of her research to bog down the story.  The mystery and  characters became secondary to her history lesson.<br />This is the first of a  proposed series by Apostolou (pseudonym for P.C. Doherty) and let us hope  that the author has gotten the desire to write historical fiction over with  and the next in the series will be an addition to the mystery genre.	1998-12-03
