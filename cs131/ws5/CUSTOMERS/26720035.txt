The beginning is extremely captivating, and I figured I'd fly right through it, but once it backtracked to tell us how we ended up at that point in the beginning, I lost interest. Not to mention that it made me really mad, almost to where I wasn't going to finish it.<br /><br />Annie Knowles is married to Michael, whose a very busy OB/GYN at a Catholic hospital in upstate New York. On top of that he's helping an friend at a downtown clinic performing abortions. While his wife thinks it's ok, most of their friends and neighbors do not, and with Michael away so much Annie starts having an affair with Simon Hass, a once-famous painter that works at the college with her.<br /><br />Simon and his wife Lydia have a very disturbing background, and Lydia (who has some major issues) is part of Life Force, a church group run by the manipulative Pastor Tim. Life Force has been terrorizing Michael and his family because of the abortions he's been performing, even putting their lives in danger. What mad me so mad was Michael's absolute refusal to just stop doing them. If not for his wife's pleading, then for the safety of his two children. It was totally unbelievable to me that he would continue to put them in such danger, and I felt it was incredibly irresponsible.<br /><br />The overall story itself wasn't bad, and I was satisfied with the ending. Though it was all a bit predictable, it was a good book nonetheless. While it wasn't a great book in my opinion, I'd be willing to pick up another of Ms. Brundages' books.	2005-10-13

About a man committing an act so heinous, and a woman finding it in her heart to see past the hurt and anger, and love that man.<br /><br />At first I didn't know what to think about the premise. In 1944 a young girl's brutally raped in the Louisiana woods by three solders. Seven years later she unknowingly falls in love with one of her attackers. I figured once she found out the truth, that would be the end of the affair. I didn't see how it could possibly go any other way and I'd still like the story. But it did.<br /><br />Now, I've never been in a situation such as Charlotte's, and I know some reviewers here had a real problem with the story, but I think because it was just purely fiction to me, I was able to enjoy it, and find it somewhat believable.<br /><br />My only issue with the book that kept me from giving it five stars was the ending. I was pretty disappointed in how abruptly it ended. After reading the last paragraph I turned the page ready to devour the next chapter and was stunned that the book was over. I really would have liked to find out everyone's fate. For the most part I really liked the book and highly recommend it, though some may be extremely sensitive to it's content, and therefore should not read this.	2005-10-04

Judith Henry Wall is one of my favorite authors, but this book just didn't stand out as much as some her earlier works have, such as Handsome Women, My Mothers Daughter, and even Blood Sisters. Now don't get me wrong, this really was a good read, but I felt it was a three star read until the ending.<br /><br />Rhonda, Holly, and Gina Kay have been friends since they were little. They plan on having big careers and leaving their little Texas town behind. They all go to the same college together, but that's where the friendship between the three falls apart.<br /><br />Rhonda's been dating her high school love Terry for five years when she leaves for college. Not wanting to give him up but not wanting to get married either, she sort of strings him along for awhile. Well, out of the blue, Gina Kay leaves school for good and marries Terry all on the same day. Rhonda doesn't speak to her for over two decades, and Holly's stuck in the middle. The three get together 25 years later, shortly after Terry's accidental death, and Gina Kay promises to tell the two women why she married him.<br /><br />For about 3/4 of the book I really couldn't stand Rhonda. We've all had that high school love-of-our-lives, but you grow up, get married, and move on. I found it really irritating that Rhonda just couldn't let it go. For being a big-shot lawyer, she was acting incredibly petty and immature. I understand why she was so hurt, but it's been 25 years...get over it. But in the end, she took the high road, which for the most part changed my opinion of her, and Gina Kay's story about how her life with Terry came to be was satisfying. While I recommend it, it's not her best stuff.	2005-09-29

It's not too often that a sequel is just as good as the original, but that was just the case here! Shocking...that is how I'd have to describe this story. But in order for it to be shocking, you HAD to of read 'The Three Miss Margaret's'. I couldn't believe the tale that was told! And just as the story before this, it was loaded with southern charm and deep secrets.<br /><br />The story is mostly told by Laurel Selene, who has inherited Garrison Gardens after Miss Peggy's death. With not a clue as to how to run a business, she's being hounded by Stuart Lawrence, the sleazy Garrison lawyer, to sign over power of attorney to him, just as the two previous Mrs. Garrison's did. Not comfortable with this setup, Laurel senses that somethings just not right with the way the whole operation is run.<br /><br />The rest of the story is told by the mysterious Mrs. Rain. Who she is, where she lives, and her ties to the Garrison's is revealed slowly through her story, but once you find out who she is...wow! I couldn't believe it!<br /><br />As I said before though, if you're thinking abut reading this book, MAKE SURE you've read 'The Three Miss Margaret's' first, everything will be so much clearer, not to mention that it too is an excellent read. I can't wait for Ms. Shaffer's next novel, and I really hope it continues with Charles Valley, GA...wether it be Laurel Selene, or someone's else's story, this is a great little town to read about!	2005-09-23

A time when women were allowed no freedoms, and her place was to see to the house, the servants, and her husband. This is Lucy Carlton's story. A woman who was born into wealth and privilege, bred to be the epitome of high-class and high society. Lucy marries William Carlton, a stock-broker who is not of her class, but makes enough money for the upper-class folks that they seemingly except him.<br /><br />Lucy struggles with fits of hysteria, and frequent headaches, and is absent or leaves early from many social gatherings. William has taken her to doctor after doctor, and nothing seems to be working...untill she starts seeing Dr. Victor Seth. Dr. Seth is a doctor of neurology, something the folks of 1885 have never heard of before. No one knows what to think of his treatments of hypnotism, but the therapy is working wonders for Lucy...for the most part.<br /><br />Dr. Seth proves to be the best and worst thing to happen to Lucy. While the hysteria fits have ended, new problems start plaguing her. She finds herself doing and feeling things that are totally foreign to her, and make William feel threatened. In the end, Lucy and William's life together will never be the same, and lies and scandal hit the high society of NYC.<br /><br />Overall a great read...the ending was excellent, something I never would of expected, and the descriptions of the time period were wonderful. The clothes, the houses, the way of life for the most important citizens of NYC, and the limitations on women of the day. I definitely won't think twice about picking up another book from this author!	2005-09-20

This was quite possibly my favorite read of the year so far. I had this book sitting on my shelf for ages, but my Aunt recently finished it and loved it, so I figured I'd finally pick it up. I can't believe I let this sit there so long!! This was a great book! Mystery, murder, betrayal, all mixed together with a heavy dose of Southern Charm!<br /><br />The Three Miss Margaret's, (Dr. Maggie, Li'l Bit, and Peggy) have been friends for years. Now much older women, they're trying to come to terms with their past, and wrap up some loose ends as the end of their lives draws nearer. Some of these loose ends involve Laurel Selene, and her father's questionable death.<br /><br />Being a story set in the deep south, there are family secrets, and twisted tales all over the place...so summarizing this book isn't what I'm gonna do. Just trust me, once you pick this up it'll be near impossible to put it down till it's finished. I can't recommend this book enough, and am so glad I finally read it. I'm going out tomorrow to pick up a copy of the sequel to this 'The Women of Garrison Gardens'. Can't wait to continue the story of Charles Valley and all it's colorful townsfolk!	2005-09-15

I'm not a big fan of short stories as it is, but I love the era of the 40's and 50's. Seeing as how that's the era these women are from, I figured I really enjoy this. Well, I was wrong. The book focuses more on the women when their older...much older.<br /><br />But that wasn't why I didn't like this book. What I didn't like was the writing style. Not AT ALL. It was extremely choppy, and I found it to be difficult to follow in many places. And the women themselves...I just didn't care for them. They were a very weird bunch, and I thought they were a bit eccentric for no apparent reason.<br /><br />Overall, not a book I recommend. But as I said, I'm also not a big short story reader. I picked this up thinking I was in for some easy, light reading...but that wasn't the case. Hope you have better luck with it!	2005-09-12

The story is set in a western Pennsylvania mining town, Coal Run, and begins with a very young Ivan Zoschensky telling us about the day Gertie blew...the mine where his father and 96 other townsmen were working when it exploded.<br /><br />Fast forward to present day, the 'Great Ivan Z.' has returned to the small town after being away for many years. Once an exceptional football player, and the town's hero, he plays no more do to an accident that shattered his knee. But there's a reason Ivan has returned. His old teammate Reese Raynor will being getting out of prison soon. He was put there for beating his wife Crystal into a coma, and reducing her to a vegetative state. Ivan feels he has some unfinished business to take care of, but he's also got a very big secret that he's trying to come to terms with.<br /><br />This storyline alone is enough to keep the reader going, but there plenty of side stories that are just as interesting, and include some great characters. Jolene, Ivan's sister, who has three children from three different fathers, but never married, the Raynor clan, Dr. Ed, the town Doc who meddles in everyone's lives for their own well being, and even the town itself, which plays an important part. I thought it was really interesting what ended up being the fate of Coal Run.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this read, and am so glad I bought it. Ms. O'Dell's way of storytelling makes you feel like you're right there in the hills of western Pennsylvania. I'm absolutely going to pick up 'Back Roads'. I'm confident it'll be just as entertaining as Coal Run was.	2005-09-07

It's the story of love, loss, and abandonment, told through the voice of Anna Crane. The story is told in a series of flashbacks, some when she's a child, others when she's a teenager, and finally when she's an adult.<br /><br />Anna and her two sisters live with their lost mother Lilly in Ohio. Their father was killed when they were very young and Lilly hasn't been the same since. She's very recluse, and quite, hardly ever leaving the house and only spending time with her three girls. Then one day she decides things need to change. She begins dating, and for the next three years a steady stream of men are in and out of their home.<br /><br />The girls (still only children) are not happy about this new arrangement, and begin to lose respect for their mother. Years go by, along with a new step-father, and Lilly seems only to be sinking deeper and deeper into herself. The girls at this point don't know what to do with her. Ruthie, the oldest, leaves to live with their aunt, and Anna, and Louise (the youngest) are left alone with her. Meanwhile Anna is struggling with her own demons in a very unhealthy teenage romance with her boyfriend Austin.<br /><br />The story closes with her mother committing the ultimate betrayal against Anna, and her battle with herself to forgive, and look at her mother for who she is, a lost soul, floating from one day to the next never real aware of her actions. I definitely recommend this book. It's an enchanting look at what tragedy, death, and loneliness can to do the human spirit. I'll most certainly be keeping an eye out for more from this talented author.	2005-09-03

I picked it up on a whim at the bookstore, and now I'm regretting spending $25 on it. The idea of the story is very interesting, but the execution of it was poorly done. Luce Adams is traveling with her dead-mothers female lover Lee, to Venice and Athens. She's there to give important family documents to the Sansovinian Museum in Venice, pertaining to her ancestors travels with the great Cassanova.<br /><br />As she travels, she reads the diary of Asked For Adams. The ancestor that traveled with Cassaova on his journey to Constantinople in 1797. This part of the story was interesting, but still slow. And the story-line of Luce and Lee was strained.<br /><br />Overall, this book had great potential, but I just couldn't get into it. From beginning to end, there was no real high point. I trudged on thinking someting exciting had to happen, but nothing. Not something I recommend, save your money.	2005-08-29

I wanted to love this book, just as I loved Crazy Ladies, and all the other books I've read by Ms. West. I started this thinking it was a definite 5 star read, unfortunately I just can't give it that many.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this was a very good book...it brought back all the women I loved from Crazy Ladies, Clancy Jane and her daughter Violet, Dorothy and her daughter Bitsy. The four of them were great (although Clancy Jane did get a bit odd there for a time), but the secondary characters were just nasty! I felt so sorry for poor Bitsy and all her men-troubles, and all one after another. And as for her daughter Jennifer (from her first marriage to two-timing Claude Wentworth), I couldn't stand her! Not one bit. I found myself getting so angry that Bitsy would continue to put up with her awful behavior!<br /><br />The men of this book were for the most part all rotten, with the exception of a couple (Tucker, Ian, and in his own way Mack), and the Wentworth's were horrible as well, but this we knew from the previous book.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy this read. There were many funny points, but just to many sad ones outweighed them. I love Ms. West, she's one of my favorite authors, but I just didn't love this book. If you've read Crazy Ladies, then definitely read this, you'll enjoy it. I guess in the end I was just taken aback by all the meanness and insensitivity that was going around. Regardless, I'm looking forward to reading much more by this author.	2005-08-20

When I started this I wasn't sure what I was getting into. I half expected a shallow chick-lit book about New York Society life, and having just finished 'The Right Address', which was awful, I really hoped this would be better. Thank goodness it was!<br /><br />Jo Slater is married to the very wealthy Lucius Slater, and she's the queen of the NYC social scene. Everyone wants to be just like her, so gracious, kind, and elegant. Life is going pretty well for Jo, she has two beautiful homes, one-of-a-kind furniture and art, and a new friend to confide into. Countess Monique De Passy.<br /><br />Monique stays with them for the summer, and the two become very close, all Jo's friends warn her that Monique is bad news, but she thinks they're jealous. Well...turns out Monique's been having an affair with Jo's husband, and after his surprise death that summer from a heart attack, Jo finds out that Lucius has changed his will and left her penniless, while Monique gets over two hundred million dollars.<br /><br />The rest of the story is exceptionally told, and the plot is amazing. Jo goes from having it all, to having to buy Hush Puppy shoes for her 9-5 job. But how she extracts revenge on The Countess is marvelous!! I couldn't stop reading till I knew how it ended. I definitely recommend this for chick-lit fans! It's not a shallow book at all, very good writing and a very original plot. Kudos's Ms. Hitchcock!!	2005-08-11

There is nothing I hate more than just giving up halfway through a book, but I couldn't take this one any longer. I also don't like writing a review for a book I didn't finish, but I feel that since I didn't finish it, people should know why, so they can avoid this awfulness.<br /><br />The book is made up of 4 short stories, of which I read 2 1/2. The first story, The Grandmothers, was ridiculous. Two woman who've been best friends for life start having a sexual relationship with the others son, and both are OK with it...very disturbing. And the writing style is so annoying, very dramatic and theatrical-like.<br /><br />The second story, Victoria and The Staveneys, was very unbelievable as well. A little black girl goes home with Edward Staveney one day after school, is in awe of their huge home, and for the next 10 yrs thinks of nothing else. She then at the age of 19 gets pregnant by his brother Thomas, but doesn't tell him for 6 yrs, and once she does, they lavish the little girl with all the perks of the good life, while Victoria slowly loses her daughter.<br /><br />And the third story, The Reason For It, is where I finally threw in the towel. What's it about? I haven't a clue. It was absolutely painful to sit there and try to force myself to read this drivel. In the end, as you can guess, I do NOT recommend this book. I'm not sure about the author, maybe some of her other novels are better, who knows, I'm not going to find out though. If you see this book anywhere, keep walking and don't waste your time.	2005-08-05

It's written in the same fashion and with the same quirky characters as a Fannie Flagg novel. This was only the second book I've read by Ms. West, but it certainly won't be my last. Crazy Ladies was a great read, and so was this.<br /><br />American Pie follows three Tennessean sisters and their grandmother...Freddie, Jo-Nell, Eleanor, and Minerva Pray. After Jo-Nell's car is hit by a train and she's in the hospital, their small little family gathers around to console one another. Freddie, all the way from California has given up her southern heritage and proclaims the west to be her new home. Leaving her husband and his sexy secretary alone on the island of Baja, she flies home to help her sisters and figure out what to do with her life after an old beau steps back in the picture.<br /><br />Eleanor lives with their grandmother Minerva Pray, and has become scared to leave the house alone. She surrounds herself with senior citizens and her family to forget about it. Minerva Pray is convinced there's a curse on the family and that all bad thing's happen in six's to them. And as Jo-Nell sits in the hospital getting better, she decides to make some major changes in her life, and a move just might be the best thing.<br /><br />Overall this was a wonderful book. One that I'd definitely recommend for fans of Southern Lit and authors such as Ms. Flagg, Sandra Dallas, and Adriana Trigiani. I can't wait to read more from Ms. West!	2005-07-31

This is one of those books that just doesn't seem deserving enough of 4 stars, but 3 is too low, so I guess it's in the middle. This book was enjoyable, a cute little read about the men/mother problems of three sisters.<br /><br />There's Alice, the oldest, who is knocking on 40's door and has never been married, or even in a serious long-term relationship. Isabel, who after 12 years of marriage is second guessing the whole arrangement, mostly due to the fact that they are seemingly unable to conceive. And Tina, the baby of the three who goes through men left and right. Then there's 'Doc', the girls mother. She's constantly putting in her two cents about their love lives, when their gonna get married, or how to fix marital problems. She was kinda annoying.<br /><br />I liked Alice for the most part. She was a little wishy-washy, and you could see a mile away where her relationship with Anthony (the Doctor who works with their mother) was going. Isabel is the narrator of the book, and she didn't really have any substance to her, no real issues (besides the ending). Everything with her was about trying to have a baby, not working but kinda wanting to, and her uncertainty about her marriage. Tina I hated. Though we never learn much about her, what we do know I really didn't like.<br /><br />In the end it's a cute book. A quick read to pass the time on a miserably hot day. But don't pick this up expecting much more than that, you'll be disappointed.	2005-07-26

Ms. Scully really is a good writer, but the characters fell a little flat for me. Not flat...just perpetually bored. Even when things around them were happening, such as the death of a child, then a husband, fires, the great depression, Regina and company seemed so lifeless.<br /><br />Time was also a problem for me. It was difficult to decipher how much time had passed between some chapters. Months to a few years could have passed, I wasn't really sure. Now, I'm not going to summarize the story since others here have, but the idea of it was appealing to me, however in the end I was just in a constant state of boredom with it.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad read. It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that it feels like nothing really happens, though things do. It was interesting to read about a the rise and fall and semi-rise again of a southern family in the early 1900's, but there was a blandness about it. I don't recommend this, nor do I think people should abstain from it...it's just one of those books that you read solely to pass the time.	2005-07-22

It is by no means great literature, but a semi-entertaining read nonetheless. I knew going into this book what it was all about, but figured, since I already bought it, might as well read it.<br /><br />Melanie was a stewardess until she met coffin tycoon Aurthur in the air. After a whirlwind romance and marriage, they move into his Park Avenue home in NYC. Melanie's not welcome in the circle of New York's elite, by she tries her darnedest. This story line was beat into our heads repeatedly for a while...Melanie tries to impress...then fails...tries again...and fails, etc.etc. Got a little old.<br /><br />There were some amusing moments and characters. Joan and Wendy, the gossipy best friends were kinda fun, and Jerome and Guffey were OK, but each storyline was wrapped up so perfectly. Morgan Vance, who after having a fling with his cleaning lady gets her knocked up...that was cleaned up nicely in the end. His wife Cordelia's klepto problem? Not a problem for long! Wendy and Joan...they get theirs.<br /><br />In the end, this was a mindless read. One that, once I'm finished with this review, will never give a second thought to. I'm not sure this deserves 3 stars, but I did sit through the whole thing, and I didn't despise it, so 3 it is. If you have nothing else to read, give this a shot, otherwise...move on.	2005-07-19

I loved everything about it, the format, the women, the secondary characters, all of it. This is Jillian and Lesley's story about friendship and changing times. Formatted as diary/journal entries, notes, letters, newspaper clippings, and e-mails, we see these two women from the time they were born (1948), all through their school days, marriages, wars, children, lost loves, acts of terrorism, and medical scares.<br /><br />Though they are both so different (Jillian's family is very wealthy, while Lesley's is just the opposite) they manage to always be their for one another. Even after Jillian moves from Washington State to New York for school, and eventually her job.<br /><br />Lesley got pregnant and married young (to a dead-beat lowlife) and never left their little town, while Jillian was off to the  city for school and big dreams. There was not a part of this book I didn't like. I read it every chance I could get, and now that I'm finished, I'm mailing it to my best friend back home. I definitely recommend this book for women, and I can't wait to read more from Ms. Macomber!	2005-07-15

I got about half-way through this book and thought I'd check the reviews on it...I was floored that so many people loved it! I just had such a hard time getting into it, so much so that about 3/4 of the way through I gave up, and that hardly EVER happens to me.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I don't think it's a bad book, or poorly written, actually just the opposite. This book is written quite well, but I think my main problem was that I couldn't get into the story. Hallie's 16 years old and hates school. She has a bit of a gambling problem, and after losing all her car-savings on a bad bet at the horse track, she needs to find an honest job. Well, she finds one as a yard girl for the Stockton family.<br /><br />This is where the story goes sour for me. I just didn't like the Stockton's and their incredible eccentricities. My mind just kept wondering off every time I picked this up. This is one of those rare books that, while I personally didn't take to it, it's not bad...get what I mean? I don't discourage anyone from reading this...but beware, it gets pretty slow in some parts, and I think you'll either love or hate the Stockton's. Oh well...better luck next time.	2005-07-10
US	26720035	RXJ3NUCF31QXV	0312333927	565853988	The Bitch Posse	Books	4	31	34	N	N	Very Entertaining!!	Unfortunately I decided to grab this book on my way out the door headed for a week camping trip. What a mistake! This book was so hard to put down, not something you should leave town with! This is the story of Amy, Cherry, and Rennie (a.k.a. the Bitch Posse).<br /><br />These three girls were best friends and blood sisters back in 1988, their senior year of high school in Holland, Illinois. The chapters alternate between each girl, and the past and present. In 1988 at the Porter Place (a local hangout for teenagers) a terrible thing happened to separate these three girls forever. The girls of today (2003) have moved on and tried to forget, scattered all over the country, we see how each one turned out after getting glimpses into their wild teenage days.<br /><br />Rennie's a famous author struggling with drugs, an addiction to sex, and trying to get her second book written, Amy's pregnant with a skeezer of a husband, but is trying with all her might to lead a simple normal life, and Cherry is in a psychiatric hospital, trying to get through each day.<br /><br />I'm telling you, once you pick this up you will not be able to put it down. Just the suspense of \\"What happened in 1988 at the Porter Place that so severely messed up these girls and kept them from ever speaking to each other again\\" will keep you turning the pages. Not recommended for anyone under the age of seventeen, but an entertaining juicy read for the rest of us.	2005-07-10

I picked it up seeking a funny, light, enjoyable read after some of the heavier themed books I've finished, and I sure found it!<br /><br />This book zips right along, formatted as diary entries of Amy Thomas, whose friends it seems are all getting married, and going crazy. Amy vows never to become a crazy, delusional bride-to-be. But when Stephen her boyfriend proposes to her, things quickly start spinning out of control. Before she knows what's happening, she's second guessing her antique engagement ring, the way Stephen proposed, her wedding dress, and fighting in public about her bridal flowers!<br /><br />As soon I finished this book I IMMEDIATELY picked up the next one, Diary of a Mad Mother-To-Be, and am half-way through already. I highly recommend this book, it's fast-paced and VERY funny! A great book for future brides, married women, or anyone even remotely interested in weddings!	2005-06-28
US	26720035	R3UKEU8ESJMDEA	031232619X	519796094	The Bachelorette Party	Books	4	2	5	N	N	Fun Read!!	When I first started this book I didn't think I was going to finish it. It starts out pretty slow, but stick with it. I'd say after the first 75 pages it really starts to pick up.<br /><br />Zadie was left at the alter by her ex-fianc&eacute; Jack, a soap star, and has found comfort in her best friend Grey. For the past 7 months she hasn't hung out with anyone else. Well, Grey announces that he's asked his girlfriend Helen to marry him. Helen is also Zadie's little miss perfect cousin. The two have never been too close.<br /><br />As the wedding gets closer Zadie gets more and more miserable at the thought of losing her best friend, but also tries to put on a happy face for Grey's sake. Against her better judgment she promises to make sure Helen has fun at her bachelorette party.<br /><br />Now this is where the book gets really good! The party starts out dull and ho-hum with tea and shopping with all Helen's snotty friends, but once they get a few drinks in little miss virginal-never-been-drunk-before Helen, the REAL partying starts! I found myself laughing out loud so many times...the scenarios I was picturing were hilarious!!<br /><br />In the end Helen gets herself in a bit of a pickle after the party, and Zadie tries to right everything while dealing with her own men-issues. I definitely recommend this book if you're looking for a fun read. These girls were crazy! I'll most certainly be keeping an eye out for more books by this author.	2005-06-23

OK, I really don't have anything against parodies, and I have a pretty open-minded sense of humor, but this book was just awful. Not once did I laugh...or even smirk for that matter. In fact, most of the time I didn't even know what was going on!<br /><br />The author continually jumps from outdated, overused clich&eacute;s to lame jokes. I was expecting to actually 'meet' five people in hell, just as we did with the original in Heaven, and I was expecting it to be done in a humorous way, but not so. The book followed a VERY weak outline of the book it's parodying.<br /><br />Overall I do not recommend. It's really just not funny, and that was the whole reason I bought it. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I actually finished it...but believe me, it wasn't easy.	2005-06-23
US	26720035	R3O9EPTVI4UU4W	1401302009	152649726	The Washingtonienne	Books	4	11	14	N	N	Juicy Stuff!!	I had this book sitting on my wish list for some time, figuring, I'll get to it eventually. Well, having just moved to the Washington D.C. area I thought, what better time than now to read a scandalously raunchy sex-filled book about our nations capitol? One thing's for sure...I will never look at Senators the same way again!<br /><br />Jackie's fianc&eacute; has just ditched her after finding out she cheated on him, and not knowing what else to do, she moves from NYC to D.C. to live with a friend. It doesn't take her very long to stir up trouble out there though. Pretty much selling herself for sex and drugs, she gets a lowly job as a Capitol Hill mail clerk, and gets through each night in a drunken, drug-induced haze...usually waking up next to some guy she's picked up at the bar. She's got 1 married man giving her a $400 per session 'allowance', and another paying her rent.<br /><br />Though I really did enjoy the book, Jackie is a pitiful, disgusting character, sleeping around and popping/snorting anything she can get her hands on (pretty sad considering she's based on the author herself).<br /><br />Jackie's been keeping an internet blog on all her happenings, and eventually it leaks out to the main stream public. Soon she's fired from her job and thrown into an all out sex scandal, and she finds that growing up and moving on is much easier said than done.<br /><br />Aside from Jackie being INCREDIBLY lazy, immature, and totally self-absorbed, she's got one heck of a story. I knew this would be a trashy, gossipy read when I picked it up, and it definitely didn't disappoint! A must-read for chick-lit fans, and though I'm not usually one, this was the exception!!	2005-06-23
US	26720035	R1OXDEQV2KQ7BC	0312323859	351920537	Something Blue	Books	5	87	92	N	N	Excellent follow-Up!!!	Even though I loved 'Something Borrowed', I really hated Darcy Rhone, and when I found out 'Something Blue' was all about her, I was very skeptical. Much to my surprise though, I LOVED this book. I think I may even like it better than the first one!<br /><br />The book starts out with a couple chapters rehashing the final pages of the first book, when Darcy finds out about Dex and Rachel's affair, and Darcy discovers her own surprise. The following chapters are Darcy being her shallow, manipulative, immature, whiney 'ol self...I still hated her, and thought nothing would change that. But about half-way through the book, when she gets to London friendless, man-less, and at her lowest, she finally starts to grow up and take a mature look at her life and where it's heading.<br /><br />Figuring she needs to end her obsession with Rachel and Dex, find a job, and not be so judgmental based on shallow observations, she sets about trying to right all the wrongs in her life. With the help of her childhood friend Ethan (the one who lives in London) she slowly starts making progress in becoming a better person overall.<br /><br />Bottom line...this was a marvelous read. I loved the ending, and even grew to like Darcy herself. Kudos to Ms. Giffin who has given us two very readable story's that are next to impossible to put down. I will definitely be keeping my eye out for her future novels, she really has a great talent for storytelling.	2005-06-11

This is the second novel of Ms. Gutcheon's I've read, (the first being More Than You Know, which is GREAT) and you can tell it's an early effort.<br /><br />The story focuses on 5 'New Girls' as they're called, who all went to the very prestigious Mrs. Pratt's School for Girls (a prep school) in the early 60's. The first chapter starts with their 15 year reunion, where we learn one of the girls has killed herself...the rest of the book tells us about each one's experience during their three years as a Pratt Girl, and their path to finding friendships with one another.<br /><br />I thought the storyline jumped around a little too much. I felt like each girl was a bit incomplete, and wanted more information at a time, instead of the scattered pieces we're given. And there were so many secondary characters that I couldn't keep up. I'd come to a name and have to stop and think about whether or not I was already introduced to this person, or if it's another new character. In my opinion, it probably would have been easier to follow if their had been one less main character, 4 'New Girls' as a opposed to 5. Also, we never find out why the one girl ended up killing herself years later. That was quite a disappointment.<br /><br />Overall, it was a decent book. I don't think it's for everyone, there's really no climatic point in the story. It's pretty much just an account of the day-to-day life of prep school girls, and their wealthy upbringings. Though it wasn't my favorite, I'll definitely read more from this author, I've read her later stuff and it's much improved.	2005-06-08

I think my main problem was right from the beginning I knew what the whole story was about and how it would go. I don't mind a little predictability now and then, but this book is VERY predictable.<br /><br />Not to say it wasn't a sweet story though, because it was. Most of the tale is told from Miss Ann's viewpoint, a neighbor and friend to Sophie. She shares with us the gentle, quite love that Sophie and Miss Ann's former gardener Mr. Oto share. Set in 1941 Georgia, everything changes for everyone after Pearl Harbor is attacked, and Mr. Oto must stop working for Miss Ann, but with her help he goes into hiding. It's about this time that Sophie and Mr. Oto discover how they feel about one another, and the story goes from there (don't want to give anything away, not that you can't figure it out though).<br /><br />Now, as sweet as the love story part of the book was, the ending was a disappointment for me. I like clean endings that wrap a story up, whether it be happy or sad...I do not however, like to be kept guessing, and that's exactly what this book did. Overall, I don't think I'd recommend this book, but I also don't discourage anyone from reading it. Many people here really enjoyed it, and that's great, but I just wasn't feelin it as much.	2005-05-31

When I started this book, I was expecting some cheesy haunted house tale...but it was actually a pretty creepy story. Not downright scary, but spooky enough. There were only a couple things that annoyed me slightly about this book.<br /><br />The first (as another reviewer already mentioned) was the main characters name, Colquitt. Doesn't really glide off the tongue too well, it was a distraction every time I came to it. Also, in the beginning of the book, Colquitt makes her and her husband Walter out to be upper middle class, saying they're just ordinary people who live ordinary lives. Well, as the story goes, you see pretty early on that they are in fact pretty darn wealthy, and live in a very rich neighborhood, attending lavish parties, spending weekends at the club, and vacationing frequently on the shore, Jamaica, and New York. The initial misrepresentation threw me a little.<br /><br />But overall the story was a good one, it kept me turning the pages to find out what the final horror of the house would be. Basically, a young new architect builds a house for a young newlywed couple. The house is amazing, but before it's even fully completed bad thing start happening. It covers the first year of the houses life, the three different family's that live in it, and the terrifying things that happen to them. Colquitt Kennedy (the next door neighbor) tells the story.<br /><br />In the end, I'd recommend this book to my friends. I'm not an avid suspense reader, but it was a nice distraction from my normal reading. As I said, not super scary stuff, but just enough to be entertaining.	2005-05-19

Halfway through this book we went on vacation, and I thought great, it's gonna take me forever to finish this book. Wrong! I read it every chance I could get, in the car, at the hotel, in between our excursions, I loved it! It was completely unbelievable, but entertaining nonetheless.<br /><br />This is a story of the 'future' (the future of 20 years ago, since that's when this book was written) told by Handmaid Offred (meaning Of Fred, i.e. belonging to). After the Presidents Day Massacre, the government was taken over by what I gathered to be an Islamic terrorist group, and women were stripped of all rights. They were no longer allowed to carry money, speak out, read or write. They were torn away from their family and assigned jobs, such as Martha's (maids, housekeepers), Jezebels (whores), Handmaids (child bearers), and Wives (married to the prestigious Commanders).<br /><br />Offred tells her story to us, about how she yearns to know what became of her family and friends, how she came to be a Handmaid, and everyone's new life in The Republic of Gilead (formally the United States). She speaks of the underground workings that try to help people flee the country, and how it gets harder and harder to remember the 'past times', she tells us about The Wall, and the people that hang from it, and a little about how the new government works.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this book. It's very different from everything else I normally read, but I enjoyed it immensely. I didn't look at this as some reviewers here did, and that was thinking Margaret Atwood was actually trying to predict the future...that's ridiculous. I took this for what it was, an incredibly powerful tale about one possibility of the future of the United States, and a look into what life would be like if women didn't have all the freedoms we have today. Definitely give this book a shot, it may not be for everyone, but you never know.	2005-05-18

After just recently finishing 'The Wedding Dress' and being only somewhat pleased with it, I was a little reluctant to pick this up, but I'm soooo glad I did. This is an excellent story of two girls and their struggles with life, war, and family.<br /><br />Taking place during WWII, Maddy and Ruth (Maddy's brother Davey's wife) head down to Miami to spend what little time they have left with Davey before he ships out. He sets them up at a friends parents house, the Silers. There are a bunch of great characters in this book, too many to name, but in short, a terrible thing happens to Maddy, and her and Ruth must stick together to sooth each others fears and concerns. And there is of course the photograph, a picture of a group of them taken the night before the boys depart. Only Ruth can see it, but it shows whats happening to each person in it, so the girls cling to it as their only hope to know the truth behind what the war's doing to the one's they love<br /><br />Told from the alternating view point of both girls, this book is very hard to put down. I very highly recommend this read, especially if you like war period romantic type books. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a romance novel, but the whole story has a romantic feel about it. I was very pleased, and feel much better about picking up another one of this authors books in the future.	2005-05-09

This was one of those books that you completely forget about 2 hours after you've finished reading it. It's the story of three sisters...Victoria, Julia, and Claire Atwater, trying to make ends meet on their Virginia plantation after the Civil War. Victoria and Julia lost their husbands to the war very soon after they were wed, and their parents were also killed, but how or why was never explored.<br /><br />The youngest, Claire, is afraid that she'll never get married and have a family since the war killed off most of the eligible men in the area, so the older sisters come up with a plan to make Claire a wedding dress to cheer her up, and give her hope. As the three girls begin the dress they make a promise to each other to have faith, and to believe that things can turn around for them.<br /><br />As the dress begins to take shape odd things start happening. Strange visitors appear and miracles happen that forever change the fates of the three women. A kind of mushy read, it really wasn't half bad, I just felt like there wasn't any 'meat' to it. It just moved along from crises to solution, heartache to joy and so on. I also have 'The Photograph' from this author, which I'm about to start reading, and while this book didn't totally disappoint me, I have higher hopes for the next one.	2005-05-05

I noticed that not to many people here seemed to like it, but I wasn't expecting literary genius when I picked this up. This is a very short (only 200 pages) little book about how much one woman's life changed with the passing of a look.<br /><br />Set in 1917 NYC, Rosemary, a very prominent society girl, decides to help a young woman, Eleanore Smith, by getting her off the street corner and out of the rain, to bring her home for a cup of tea and some dry clothes. While there, Rose's fianc&eacute; Philip comes by, and an unmistakable look of want passes between he and Eleanore. Rose quickly gets the girl out of the house and thinks nothing more of the incident.<br /><br />But Philip hasn't forgotten about the beautiful young woman, and what takes place in the following pages forever changes the lives of everyone one involved. I finished this book in a day, just picking it up in between chores and other things. It was very hard to put back down. The chapters are very small, only a few pages, and you'll become engrossed in this book from the first one. I highly recommend this book as a great afternoon read. You won't be disappointed.	2005-05-02

Ok, though I really did enjoy this book, something about it is holding me back from saying it's a four star read, however three stars doesn't seem deserving enough. I picked this book up because the premise sounded really different and interesting, which it was...and curiosity kept me reading, but I think it was how quickly the ending was wrapped up that turned me off a bit.<br /><br />Nine friends stand on Beacon Hill in June of 1972, graduation day, and make a drunken promise to meet back there in 20 years for a reunion, no matter what. Well, skip now to 1992, Willa Durrell, while promoting her new book, runs into Patrick, one of the guys from the old gang, and the pair team up to get ahold of everyone to remind them about the upcoming reunion. As the two of them slowly start finding the rest of the group (who are all as different as night and day) one person cannot be found, Angel Busky. What happened in the days after graduation that no one seems to want to talk about? Did Angel really run away like everyone's though for the last 20 years, or did something awful happen to her?<br /><br />As the night of the reunion draws nearer, tensions run high. They've all grown up and most have made something of themselves. Willa refuses to stop until she finds out what happened to her friend. Then one of them dies under suspicious circumstances at the reunion party. Willa finds she's now in a dangerous position as one of their own is trying to keep the past quiet. Though this book was suspenseful enough, the ending disappointed me only in how quickly everything was wrapped up. Other than that...a really good book. I was completely surprised with who the culprit turned out to be, I thought I had it figured out halfway through the book, but not at all! If you enjoy mysteries, then overall I recommend this read. Not at all a bad way to past the time.	2005-05-01

We first meet sisters Marynell and Louise when they are young women in 1937 (20 and 19 yrs.) looking for suitable husbands. They're from a military family and expect to marry military officers just as their mother did, and have beautiful West Point weddings, crossed sabers and all.<br /><br />We follow Louise (who primarily tales the story) and Marynell through about 50 years of heartache, joy, passion, love, three wars, death, and everything else that could possibly be in between. Having grown up military my entire life, and being the wife of a military officer, I personally found this book fascinating. It was so interesting to see what a huge part officer's wives played in the military of the 30's, 40's and 50's. All the tea's, bridge games, committees, entertaining that went on, and you see how this lifestyle starts to affect each sister differently.<br /><br />This being an almost 600 page book, I can't possibly summarize everything, or even come close, but I highly recommend this read if you're at all interested in family saga's, or the military way of life. My only qualm with this book was all the sex talk, it didn't bother me, I just found it a little distracting at times. I didn't realize sex would be such a big part of this book, it took me a bit by surprise. But nonetheless, Judith Henry Wall has woven a very readable tale that's almost impossible to put down till it's finished.	2005-04-27

This was my second book from Judith Henry Wall, the first being 'My Mother's Daughter', and once again I was very pleased. So pleased in fact, that I've bought 4 more of her books. This is the story of four Colorado girls...Helen, Bonnie, Jen, and Libby. As children they promise to always be together, and when they get older, to go to NYC and really make something of themselves.<br /><br />But time goes on and the four girls graduate high school, then college together. Bonnie, Jen and Helen all find their future husbands and start to settle down. Libby, the fragile, angle-like dreamer of the group, and extremely talented ballet dancer can be tamed by no man. She sort of hovers on the outside of the group for a while, bitter about her friends abandoning their childhood dream. Babies are born, careers are started, homes bought, ect.<br /><br />The three couples married within months of each other, Libby being a maid-of-honor at each girls wedding, and every year they throw an anniversary party. At the fifth party, Libby shows up acting very strange, sort of detached from reality, they take her home to rest, and she's never heard from again. Libby seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. The only thing missing are her car and purse. No clothes, money, valuables, nothing.<br /><br />The remaining three girls are then thrown into a 15 year journey of trying to find out what happened to Libby. Perfect Libby...or so they thought. In their search they slowly uncover disturbing facts about their friend, things that affect all of them, and even threaten to ruin the lives they've so carefully built. I wouldn't say I was super surprised by the ending, but I was very happy with it. This book was so captivating, I hated to put it down. I definitely recommend this book, and any others by Ms. Wall. She's an excellent author, and a tremendous storyteller.	2005-04-18

Set in 1950's Hollywood, it explores the dark, twisted lives of high powered studio men, call girls, drugs and murder. Bill and Lora are siblings living in quiet suburbia in Pasadena. He's a cop and she's a school teacher. Then Bill meets vivacious Alice Steele when her car hits his. A friendship blossoms, and soon after a relationship. The two marry, buy a house, and settle into simple lives.<br /><br />In the beginning all is well. Lora is happy for her brother and loves having sophisticated Alice around, who throws lavish neighborhood parties and is always in the spotlight. But soon Lora starts to notice little things that don't seem quite right. Dark edges around sweet Alice...who is Alice really, and where did she come from?<br /><br />As Lora gets deeper and deeper into the trenches of shady Hollywood, she begins to realize that she's getting caught up in everything, she's beginning to change from the mundane schoolteacher into something else, something bad. Can she figure everything out before it's too late? I've gotta say I really recommend this book. I initially picked it up because of the era it's set in, but the story really grabbed me.

It's about tough journalist J.J.Warren who has to interview communications mogul William Andrews. Andrews is used to having people kiss his butt and do whatever he needs done, well, J.J.Warren doesn't, she tells him exactly what she thinks of him and the way he runs his company. They end up falling in love, and quickly get married, then she begins investigating the horrible death of his first wife Kay Parker.<br /><br />Kay was brutally shot in the head at the couples ski cabin by an intruder who was never found. The deeper Jane (J.J.) gets into the mystery, the more that starts going wrong. Someone is trying to silence her...but who? Honestly, once I got to the point in the book where you FINALLY find out what's going on, I didn't care anymore. I was sooooooo sick of the previous 250 of Jane second guessing EVERYTHING that was going on. Every little thing was analyzed 16 different ways, very trying on my patience.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this book two stars because I actually finished it, and I did that because a small part of me was curious to find out what was going on...also the ending was a surprise, avid mystery readers might have spotted it earlier, but myself not being one, I was pleased with the ending. That said, I can't really say that I'd recommend this...I just didn't like the writing style and the story draaaggged on. Definitely find something else.	2005-04-06

The book opens with two little girls in central Utah, 8 yr. old Cindy, and 6 yr. old Allison, playing in the woods not far from their homes. A man with a beard confronts them at gun-point and orders them to take off their clothes. The little girls run, but after slipping and falling, Allison is knocked out. When she awakes her friend Cindy is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />This is the start of a very hard life for Allison Jensen. Allison is raised in the wicked, cult-like surroundings of the Mormon church. She realizes early on just how wrong the whole Mormon 'religion' is , and does everything to rebel against her fathers and the churches beliefs.<br /><br />So much happens to Allison, and at such a fast pace that it's nearly impossible to put this book down. There's rape, murder, physical and mental abuse, a mass cover-up, conspiracies, and everything in between. I'm not a big suspense reader, but I definitely recommend this book. Can't wait to read more from Ms. Collins.	2005-03-29

It consists of about 70 or so very short stories (each maybe two or three pages) about going home. I am currently getting ready to move away from the town I've lived in pretty much my whole life, and am kinda bummed about it, but reading this book was just what I needed. It reminds us that no matter how far away we get from home or family, and regardless of how long we're gone...coming back is such a welcoming feeling. I look forward to the next Rocking Chair Reader: Memories From the Attic.	2005-03-24

It took me forever to finish it, and I was never really interested throughout the length of the story. I just kept thinking the whole situation was ridiculous.<br /><br />Maddy Green was married to Jack, the love of her life whom she met in college. They had a great 10 year marriage which ultimately fell apart due to a series of unfortunate events. Now, I really did find the divorce sad, and even a little unecessary...it was obvious these two really loved one another, but regardless, they separated.<br /><br />So Maddy moved from NYC to Atlanta, finds a job as a graphic designer and starts dating her (very wealth) boss Andrew. He's no Jack, but she enjoys his company. Well, Jack contacts her after 3 years of not speaking and it just seemed to me that she jumped at everything he wanted her to do. This is supposed to be an intelligent businesswoman, and she throws her future away for her ex-husband?? Unbelievable.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't hate this book, but I didn't love it either. I didn't really like any of the characters, I couldn't relate, and the story was very predictable. It seems unfathomable to me that Maddy wouldn't just get on with her life and forget about the past. But hey, that's just me. I recommend it you're looking for a mindless way to pass the time, but definitely not one of my favorites.	2005-03-18

It wasn't exceptional...but not a bad read either. I guess for me it ran right down the middle. This is the story of Alleta Honor, who's raising three children (and pregnant with the fourth) and dealing with her sleaze-ball husband Jimmy, who's drinking and runnin' around are taking it's toll on the family.<br /><br />Now, Aletta has a special talent that she's kept secret for most her life, whenever she touches people she sees images about their lives, wether it be their past, present or future. After unexpectedly helping a woman at the town's bicentennial parade, she realizes that she may be able to make a little money off her talent, she needs to make it somehow due to her husbands absence and the bills piling up.<br /><br />Once Aletta sticks that sign on her front lawn advertising psychic readings for $5.00, everything in the little town of Okay, Oklahoma, and the Honor household begins to change. How the townsfolk, Aletta and her family deal with things are at times funny and heartbreaking. We're given pieces of Aletta's childhood throughout the book, and learn how she came to inherit this talent, and how her family and friends delt with it.<br /><br />I don't highly recommend this book, nor do I discourage anyone from reading it. I didn't find it to be a stand out book, but I liked it nonetheless. Just you're run-of-the-mill small town southern story, with a little psychic powers thrown in. Not too bad.	2005-03-01

It starts out in 1944 in Bakerton, PA, a small coal mining town...and follows the Novak family for about 20 years. Each chapter/section is told from a different family members point of view.<br /><br />You start out with Rose Novak, the mother of the family who  struggles with the early death of her coal mining husband, and raising the children. Georgie, the oldest, who starts out away at war, then marries a woman who doesn't exactly fit in with the family. Dorothy, who escapes the little mining town for D.C.,but after a tragic event, must rely heavily on her family. Joyce is next...she has high hopes for her life and is very smart and responsible, which ultimately works against her when she's the one who must look after their aging mother and the younger children. Sandy is the second to last, and after his father's death becomes quite rebellious. As he gets older, he drifts farther and farther away. Finally we have little Lucy, the baby of the group, who's trying to figure out where she belongs in life.<br /><br />Overall, this book was excellent...even though it's still early...I know this will be on my Favorites of '05 list. I would have liked to of heard a little more from Sandy, to find out what he was doing in Colorado and California (I have a pretty good idea, but it would have been nice to find out for sure)...but other than that this book was perfect. I highly recommend!!	2005-02-21

OK, I normally HATE chick-lit books, and that was what I was expecting when I picked this up, but actually, I loved it! I read all the reviews before starting this, and seeing as how everyone raved about it, I gave it a shot. So glad I did.<br /><br />Rachel and Darcy have been best friends since their childhood in Indiana. Now they are both living in NYC and Rachel has just turned 30...and also just slept with Darcy's fiance. When I first started reading peoples reviews, I couldn't believe how they all rooted for Rachel and Dex...but after getting deeper and deeper into the book, I was doing the same thing! I actually grew to despise Darcy. She was so incredibly immature for a woman of 29 yrs. How Rachel managed to stay friends with her all that time was beyond me, but I loved the character of Rachel.<br /><br />She's so down-to-earth, and I found myself saying a bunch of times, 'I know EXACTLY what she means!!', or, 'I've been there, and that's just what I was thinking to'. The ending was also really good. Half of it was a complete surprise, and I was very satisfied with the other half. I'm really looking forward to 'Something Blue' coming out this summer. Hopefully it will continue the saga of this very entertaining group of people. I definitely recommend!!	2005-01-28

The story is about a man, Dr. Mark Albright, veterinarian to the stars, who travels to DeClare, OK to find out about his birth mother. Mark's father has recently passed away, and while going through his things, he discovers he was adopted, and was originally from OK.<br /><br />Well, back in 1972 in Declare, a young woman (Gaylene Harjo) was stabbed to death, and her 10 month old baby, Nicky Jack went missing. After years searching, the town feared him dead, and no definitive answers were giving as to who killed Gaylene.<br /><br />Well, Mark discovers he's Nicky Jack. The towns divided as to wether they think he's the real deal, or a con artist. But Mark is taken in by Teeve, his aunt, and Ivy his cousin. With their help, and the help of a bunch of other very colorful townsfolk, they are searching for answers as to why and who killed his mother, how did Mark/Nicky Jack end up in California with his adoptive family, and who's been trying for 27 years to cover up the facts.<br /><br />There were twists and turns all over this book, and you'll NEVER guess who was responsible for the killing/kidnaping. I highly recommend this read. This was my second book by Ms. Letts, and I loved it, just as I did The Honk and Holler. Can't wait to read more from her, she's quickly turning into one of my favorite authors!	2005-01-20

I fell in love with almost everyone from the sweet little town of Paris, Arkansas right away. Once I picked this book up I wasn't able to put it down. I became hooked pretty much from the get-go.<br /><br />The story centers around a group of 5 friends. Wood McIlmore, the town doctor, and his socially perfect wife Milan. Mavis...the owner of the local bake shop, Brundidge...who runs the liquor store and is always impeccably dressed...and Jeter, their quadriplegic (due to a football accident in high school) friend who resides at the nursing home.<br /><br />As Ms. Thomason takes us deeper and deeper into the lives of these 5 people, you actually begin to feel like you've know them all your life. The problems this group faces singularly, and as a whole grabs your attention and won't let go till you've finished the book. A lot of ground is covered in this story, infidelity, suicide, murder, interracial couples, homosexuality, the slow death of small town America, and the importance of friends in our lives.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book. If you're looking for a satisfying read, you'll most certainly find it here. I can't wait for Ms. Thomason to come out with another novel. I loved Designing Women, I loved this book, and I have high hopes for the next tale she graces us with.	2005-01-16

Not because it's awful, or poorly written...actually, I thought it was written quite well, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. Its just that I didn't get it. After getting more than halfway through this book I realized...I didn't care about any one of the characters, I didn't care what happened to them, didn't fully understand who they were, nothing at all. I skimmed the last 1/3 of the book just to see if it would get a little more exciting...it never did.<br /><br />Cassie was likeable enough, but I found her to be to hard and empty, and her sister Belle obviously had some serious problems, but what they were I couldn't tell you. And Puck and Emmy...what a bizzare pair. What it comes down to is this book just wasn't for me. The reading is extremely choppy, and difficult to follow in some places. What I got wasn't quite what I expected when I started reading. It's not that I don't recommend the book, I personally didn't take to it, but I really like Haven Kimmel, and have high hopes for the next book of hers I pick up.	2005-01-11

Well, having recently finished Celia Rivenbark's 'We're Just Like You Only Prettier', which was very amusing, I figured this book would be similar to that one. The reviews said it was very humorous, and entertaining. I'm sorry, but I do not agree. Julia Reed is a Vogue writer living in New York City, but she's from Mississippi. Now, I felt that at times when describing the silly ways of the southern women's traditions, it was almost like she was making fun of them. But then when she would bash the Yankees (which I happen to be, and am darn proud of it) she was all for her southern heritage.<br /><br />I love southern books, and I've always had this fascination with the south. I truly hope one day to live there when my husband retires. I have always admired southern women, their traditions, their tight family bonds, and the land itself. Ms. Reed made these women sound ditsy, and shallow, while making us Yankees sound like ignorant, clueless slobs. And she made the area (the south) sound like pure hell to live in.<br /><br />I gave this 2 stars because there were some interesting facts in it, and some of the events that go on down there were really neat to learn about, and all the food she talked about, sounds delicious! But overall I'd just like to forget this book. It has in no way changed my opinion of southern men and women, or the south itself, and I can only hope they don't look at the Yankees the same way Julia Reed does. If you're looking for a funny book on the 'ways of the south', pick up Ms. Rivenbarks book, that one won't disappoint.	2005-01-04

It's very short, it only took me a day to finish, and I really wanted to know who-dunnit, but the story seemed to be lacking some, and was a bit repetitious. The excitment didn't really pick up till about 3/4 of the way through.<br /><br />This is the story of the Dreghorns. A very prominent family living in England that has ownership of a glorious house and all it's property. When Judah Dreghorn, the eldest of four brothers (3 surviving) dies in a freak accident, everything they know is challenged. The two surviving brothers, the widow of the previously dead one, and Mr. Henry Rathbone, a long-time family friend, come to tend to Judahs widow Antonia, and their son Joshua. While there they all try to figure out the mystery of how Judah died exactly, and for what reasons.<br /><br />I found the battle of the property to be a little confusing sometimes, but by the end I knew how it worked and what was going on. I gave this 3 stars because I was truly surprised with the ending of this book. The mystery part of it is very clever, however the rest seemed to fall a little flat for me. Overall, I though it was decent read for the Christmas season, and though I don't highly recommend it, it's not a complete waste of time.	2004-12-27

And when it finally arrived, I dropped everything and started on it right away! I will say I thought this was a very funny book, and I found myself laughing out-loud quite a  few times!<br /><br />Being a born and raised, 100%, absolute Yankee, I loved reading about the quirky ways of the south. The 'mommy-wars', the right and wrong ways to conduct yourself as a 'proper' southern lady, and how NOT to let your husband dress the child, were all very amusing. I normally only read books that take place down south as I love reading about the friendly people, warm climate, and their simple way of life.<br /><br />This book was a very cute and realistic look at the folks of the south, and I highly recommend it if you're looking for a quick little read that will make you laugh. I can't wait to read 'Bless your Heart Tramp', and hope it's as cleverly written as I found this one to be. I'm definitely glad I bought it!	2004-12-24

This was the first book by Billie Letts I have read, and I will definitely be reading more. This was such a good book! This is a classic story of small town southern living. Chaney, a disabled Vietnam war vet, works and lives at The Honk and Holler Opening Soon, in Oklahoma. He and Molly O, his mother figure from childhood with her own very difficult teenage daughter Brenda, keep the joint going, but things have slowed down considerably in the 12 years it's been open.<br /><br />Then, in one day walks Vena Takes Horse. A fiery woman with no particular place she calls home. After some heavy persuading, she starts working at The Honk, and soon the place is booming (I never really understood why all of a sudden the place went from dead to packed, which is why I gave it 4 1/2 stars). Vena starts to feel more and more at home as she becomes closer with Chaney and Molly O, but you can't help wondering if she's gonna stay or flee into the night as she's so prone to do.<br /><br />We also get to know Bui Khan, a Vietnamese man who has come to America to find a nice, safe place to settle down with his wife, who is still in Vietnam. Bui comes to work at the Holler as well, and soon, we're reading about all the funny, quirky, painful, and touching things this very unlikely foursome get themselves into. This book shows us that no matter how different some people may be from one another, if you take the time to get to know them, you can learn some very valuable things from them. I highly recommend this book, and can't wait to read more by this author.	2004-12-18

Having read all of Ms. Flagg's novels, she is without a doubt my favorite author. I only wish she had more books out there for me to read. So when I saw this book had been released, I was ecstatic! This is a touching Christmas tale about a man (Oswald T. Campbell) and the wonderful little town of Lost River Alabama (a place I wish existed, cause I'd move there in a heartbeat!).<br /><br />Oswald is told by his doctor that he must leave the Chicago cold for the warmer temperatures of the south for serious health reasons. Lost River has been recommended to him as an ideal place to go, so he packs up, and heads down there, thinking he'll just be there for the winter. But as time goes on, Oswald falls in love with the little town, and all it's residence, including one very special redbird, Jack, and one precious little girl, Patsy.<br /><br />Of course I absolutely recommend this book for people of all ages, it's such a sweet Christmas story that I can't give enough praise to. Hopefully I won't have to wait so long for Ms. Flaggs next novel, but I'm confident it'll be just as wonderful as this one and all the others she has given us.	2004-12-07

Having grown up in Gales Ferry, this book was very cool for me. Though I now live in Groton (the next town to the south) my parents still live in Gales Ferry. These are the most amazing books on town history I've ever read. It was so neat to see pictures of my elementary and high schools, and learn the history of the town I lived in for so long.<br /><br />The pictures these books have are amazing. I've read the Groton book as well as some other surrounding towns, and the information these books possess is incredible. I highly recommend finding one of these books about your own town.

I definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking to get away from the traditional sappy Christmas tale, beacuse you won't find it here! Little Joshua Barker sees 'Santa' take a shovel to the head and wishes that a miracle will bring him back to life. Santa was really the drunk town jerk, but how's Joshua supposed to know that? So down comes Archangle Raziel (who's not the brightest in the bunch) to save the day and grant a child a Christmas Miracle, only he royally screws things up.<br /><br />The town thinks Raziel is a mentally retarded child abductor, the annual Lonesome Christmas party at the church turns into a nightmare due to Raziel's 'Christmas Miracle', people are shot, bitten, set on fire, and get their brains sucked out. I'm telling you, you won't find this kind of story anywhere else. It's hilarious!! I absolutely recommend this book if your looking for a Christmas laugh. Oh, and Roberto the talking bat is a riot as well, definitely read this book!! :)	2004-11-30

It's the story of one family told through three generations of Christmas Letters (well, two really, the third generation only writes one letter). Now, it was very difficult for me to get past the feeling of...'why is all this stuff being written in x-mas letters, shouldn't the family have already known about all this stuff? Wouldn't you tell your family these things as they happen?'.<br /><br />I know it was necessary to include these things in order for the reader to understand everything that's gone on in the family over the years, but it was very distracting. This said, I think this book would have been much better if it were formatted as a regular novel, not in Christmas letters. I believe it would have been a very interesting read.<br /><br />But regardless, the story itself was good. It kept me turning the pages. I really enjoyed the second to last letter, where Mary (the second generation) sends out the REAL Christmas letter, not the superficial one that everyone gets saying all is peachy-keen and life couldn't be more perfect, blah, blah, blah. This letter tells us the 'good stuff'. I recommend this book as a very quick little Christmas read. It'll help you get into the Christmas spirit.	2004-11-30

Holding on to a floating bale of marijuana, she manages to stay alive for about 8 hours till she's finally rescued by Mick, a retired police officer who lives in peaceful seclusion on his own little island.<br /><br />Joey's royally pissed at her husband, who's a crooked biologist, and she and Mick hatch up a plan to drive him crazy enough to blow open the whole operation himself...by her playing dead and messing with him.

This book is amazing in all the pictures and history it gives you on the little town of Mystic. I was surprised to learn so much about the town, to see all the photos of farmland, and shipbuilding, the way it was before it became such a tourist trap. I love these books, and really recommend people pick one up about their own town. There are hundreds of them, and chances are there's one about your town. They are full of history and information.

When I took the dog out for a walk, I saw many houses that were featured in this book, and of course the Griswold monument. It was all VERY interesting. I've picked up the books for the neighboring towns as well. I'm confident they'll be just as interesting!	2004-11-21

I enjoyed it, but found it to be very dark most times. It's the story of a young Louisiana girl, Nita, who wants to get as far away from her currant situation as possible. Her step-father is creepy, her mother cares about nothing other than pleasing him, and she's in a dead-end job waiting tables at the local diner.<br /><br />Along comes Louis, who offers marriage, a car, and a chance to get away from it all. Only problem is she doesn't love him, she can barely stand to be near him, she just wants what he can offer her. As their life goes on, and they begin to have children and really get to know one another, the story turns very depressing.<br /><br />You realize very early on that there is something seriously wrong with Nita. Nothing is good enough for her, nothing makes her happy, she is constantly upset or depressed about one thing or the other. That made this a very difficult read for me. I would get so angry at Nita that I would just throw the book down and not pick it up for days. The abuse scenes were hard to take as well...and as the book moved along they appeared more frequently.<br /><br />Overall, I would have to say this book was so-so. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone, just based on the dreary subject matter, but I didn't hate it. It was an interesting read to say the least.	2004-11-17

This is a generational story about the Anton family, focusing mainly on Pauline and Michael. They meet during WWII, fall in love, have a hasty wedding and start their lives.<br /><br />As the inner-cover tells us though, they never should of married one another. Pauline and Michael just can't seem to get the grasp of the  whole 'married' thing, and life is a roller coaster of good times and bad for them and their children. Each chapter begins years down the road from the previous one, and is sometimes told by different points of view. Mainly Pauline tells the story, but as her children age, we get to hear their side of things as well. Overall the story spans about 60 years.<br /><br />This book is very different from almost anything I've ever read before and I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. There's a lot of unexpected in it, sometimes you know exactly where the story's going, other times your blown away by what's going on. Can't wait to read more by this author.	2004-10-26
US	26720035	R2A29X05SVNYGN	0743411250	940771299	The Woman Next Door	Books	3	6	6	N	N	More like 3 1/2 stars...	I'm a fan of Barbara Delinsky. I've read a few of her books, and enjoyed them, as I did this one. However, I thought the story was a bit repetitious...like she had to fill so many pages. The story is centered around Amanda and Graham O'Leary. The couple has been married for 5 years and is struggling to conceive a child. They have been seeing a fertility specialist for some time and nothing seems to be working. This part of the story got old real quick. The two of them would fight, and voice their fears, and then 20-30 pages later they'd be fighting about the same thing, and worrying about the same fears.<br /><br />I found the other three households on the cul-de-sac to be much more interesting, though we didn't get to learn nearly as much about them. There's Georgia, a high powered business woman, and her stay-at-home husband Russ...Karen, a mother or four and her philandering husband Lee...then there's Gretchen, the young beautiful widow who becomes pregnant months after her husbands death. I really enjoyed this part of the story. Which husband was responsible for this? Who was the cheater? It's what got me to finish the book. But alas, I was disappointed with the end. I can't get into it without giving anything away, but I wasn't happy with who turned out to be the father of her baby.<br /><br />Regardless, it wasn't a bad book, just a bit monotonous. I will say that I was pleased with half the ending, and the side stories were really what kept me interested. Ms. Delinsky is still a favorite of mine, but this book was just ok. Oh well, better luck next time.	2004-10-14

I only gave it 4 stars because some of it was a bit dragging, but overall it held my interest. It's about the slow deterioration of one south Texan family, and one awful summer for a 12 year old girl, Kayla, and her thirteen year old neighbor Charles Dale. They find out the truth about the secrets their parents have been keeping for 12+ years, and deal with the shattering consequences they bring to both families.<br /><br />This was a very sad book, but at the same time a pleasant one. Kayla really grows up this particular summer, and even though the ending isn't what most of us would like to see, it was what was best for everyone. And by the end of the novel, Kayla also understands this. I would definitely recommend this book. I didn't think it was a real fast paced gripping tale, I took my time with it, but it was one that I really enjoyed. I'll be looking out for more books by this author.	2004-10-08

The story is told from a few different point of views, but mainly by Martha Clair and her adoptive daughter Cissy. Spanning 3 generations, there's so much to tell.<br /><br />Martha Clair and her sister Justine have grown up in the idyllic little town of Columbus Texas. Her new husband Grayson went off to fight in WWII, and it chronicles the family's life thereafter. The deaths, family life, unspeakable heartbreak and betrayal, and ultimately forgiveness. There is so much story in this book that I don't know where to start. All I can do is recommend this book HIGHLY!!!<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars for two reasons, the first being that it's very difficult to decipher time. At the beginning of each chapter a couple months to a couple years may have gone by, you're never really sure until about half-way through a chapter when an age or event is mentioned, and then your trying to figure out in your head exactly what year it is, and just when you figure it out, another chapter begins and your lost again. I overlooked this though and focused on the story itself.<br /><br />The second thing was the hostility Martha Claire possessed. At first you expect it and understand it. But as the years drag on I started to get annoyed. Either DO something about the situation or shut-up and get over it...that's how I felt. By the end I was thinking \\"Enough is enough!!!'<br /><br />But overall, this was an excellent book! As I said...almost perfect! I definitely recommend to any woman to give this book a try!!	2004-09-20

This was a beautiful look at a ranching family in Montana, and the struggles they go through with the land and each other. I didn't want to rush this book in any way. I wanted to savor every chapter, which is just what I did. The detailed discriptions of the land, and how their life is run made me feel like I was right there.<br /><br />Blake Arbuckle tells the story of his family that begins in 1916 when he's 13 yrs. old, and goes on to 1946. By the end of this book I felt like they were all part of my own family. I highly recommend this book. Even though it's not fast paced, or a riveting tale that you finish in one day, it's a fascinating look at what life was like on a ranch, and the trials this one family endures. I would love to see a sequel to this book to find out what happens to the next generation of Arbuckles.	2004-09-12

I picked it up seeking a funny, light, enjoyable read after some of the heavier themed books I've finished, and I sure found it! <br /> <br />This book zips right along, formatted as diary entries of Amy Thomas, whose friends it seems are all getting married, and going crazy. Amy vows never to become a crazy, delusional bride-to-be. But when Stephen her boyfriend proposes to her, things quickly start spinning out of control. Before she knows what's happening, she's second guessing her antique engagement ring, the way Stephen proposed, her wedding dress, and fighting in public about her bridal flowers! <br /> <br />As soon I finished this book I IMMEDIATELY picked up the next one, Diary of a Mad Mother-To-Be, and am half-way through already. I highly recommend this book, it's fast-paced and VERY funny! A great book for future brides, married women, or anyone even remotely interested in weddings!	2004-08-30

During the first book we got to follow Amy going crazy and stressing throughout her wedding...this time we follow her into the joys (and pitfalls) of being pregnant.<br /><br />Deciding almost overnight that she wants to have a baby after swearing she wasn't ready, Amy and Stephen get pregnant, and she buys another trusty manual (remember Beautiful Bride?) to guide her along the way. But more often than not, Baby How, Baby Now, her how-to guide, ends up causing her and Stephen more stress than anything else. Dealing with a new job, a wierdo who's only attracted to pregnant woman, an annoying doctor (the Crotch Whisperer!!), herds of strangers rubbing her belly, and the ever popular To-Do-List, Amy nearly drives herself and her husband nuts, while sending the reader into fits of laughter.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book just as I did the first one. For anyone whose had a child, they'll know exactly what Amy's going through...as for the rest of us, we know what to look forward to (ugh!!). I can only hope Ms. Wolf gives us more adventures of Amy, Stephen, and now baby Stewart!!	2004-08-30

This is a very dark and depressing look at a poor family in Paradise, Oklahoma. I thought this was going to be another light southern fiction book that I'd love, but instead I got a book filled with prostitution, sex, rape, murder, child and spousal abuse. I could only take this book in little doses, seeing as how it's such a downer.<br /><br />It took me a while to finish, the story was intersesting enough to make me want to know how it ended, but not enough for me to read it in one day. I don't know that I'd recommend this to anyone, it being such a dreary book and all...but if your interested in reading it, it's not a bad story, I just wasn't expecting it.	2004-08-27

I enjoyed this book, I really did, however I thought there were too many parts that droned on to long. The author paints such a vivid picture of life on a Virginia mountain in 1940...but he put so much effort into his discriptions, that a bunch of times I found myself getting annoyed that I wasn't learning more about the characters themselves.<br /><br />The book starts out with a car accident that leaves Lou (12) and Oz (7) pretty much parentless. Their father is killed, and their mother is in a coma of sorts. They move from the busy streets of New York City to the VERY rural mountains of Virginia to be with their great-grandmother Louisa. From there Lou and Oz learn to work the land, befriend some unexpected people, and learn to really believe in their family and each other.<br /><br />Overall, a good story, I only gave it 3 stars though cause the beginning is very slow, far to much discription going on, not enough character build-up. Also, at times these children seemed WAY beyond their years. For only being 7 years old, Oz spouts out some pretty profound stuff, and Lou is even more mature! Not very believable, but aside from that, this was a good read, one that I would recommend for a rainy day, or if your between books. I don't think I'll be rushing out to read more by this author though.	2004-08-16

I don't like legal, courtroom drama books, so I've never cared to read his stuff before, but this is NOTHING like that.<br /><br />This is the story of Neely Crenshaw coming home after being gone for 15 years. The once All-American football hero in a town that lives, breathes, and eats football. His old coach Eddie Rake is dying, and many of his past players of his 30+ years as a coach are coming home to say good-by. Rake was known as one of the toughest, meanest, and most accomplished coaches in the state. The guys never knew whether they loved him, or hated him.<br /><br />This book is about the personal struggle Neely goes through to let go of his past glory days as a hero, get over a career ending injury, and finally forgive a coach who made these boys men.<br /><br />I really recommend this book, if your a fan of Grishams normal leagal stuff, then you'll probably hate it, but for the rest of us, it's a very short read that'll take you back to the good 'ol days. I only hope he comes out with more books like this.	2004-08-10

This book is about nothing more than a bunch of low-life degenerates who gathered together and call themselves a town. Their only purpose in this book is to try to cheat the government.<br /><br />Russell Hokes was extremely annoying, and his lame 'jokes' got real old real fast. Not to mention that they wern't funny, not even a little bit. It's not that I took offense to anything he wrote, it's just that everything he wrote was unbelivably stupid.<br /><br />I think you have to have a really bizarre sense of humor to find this book entertaining. All I know is I will never read another book by any of these authors ever again.	2004-08-07

I liked the idea of it, and the two stories in one, but it just didn't grab me and hold my attention. Don't get me wrong, the book is pretty good, I just never felt a real connection with any of the characters or events.<br /><br />The book is mainly about Casey Ellis, whose father Connie Unger passed away. She always knew who he was but never met him, and resented him for not trying to find her. Well, he leaves her his townhouse on Beacon Hill, and she proceeds to try to find out all about Connie, his life, who he was and ect. She stumbles upon a story about a young girl named Jenny Clyde and her struggles with an abusive father, a town where no one talks to her, and how she goes about overcoming her troubles (this is the second story). But Casey gets only parts of the story at a time. She must figure out how to put all the pieces together and and solve the puzzle that she believes her father left her.<br /><br />Now, I figured out the big secret about half-way through the book, so once it was revealed, I wasn't very surprised. All the clues the author gives you, I almost wonder if that was the intent. It was about that time I started losing interest. I love Barbara Delinsky, and have read a bunch of her books, but this one just wasn't one of my favorites. I'll definitely continue reading her stuff, but this will not be at the top of my list. All I can say is that I hope you have better luck with it than I did.	2004-08-04

I have now read all of Sandra Dallas' books, and this one was by far my favorite. I loved reading about Effa Commander, Whippy Bird, May Anna and the rest of the gang. They're such a fun bunch.<br /><br />This book is about Effa Commander and Whippy Bird getting out the true story about the lives of their two best friends Marion Street (May Anna) and Buster Midnight. May Anna grew up to be a famous Hollywood starlet and Buster a champion boxer. This is mainly their tale, but we also get to learn about Effa and Whippy.<br /><br />Hollywood has tarnished the reputation of Buster Midnight after a grissly murder involving he and May Anna, and Effa and Whippy Bird are tired of it. So they've decided to 'set the record straight' and let everyone know the real Marion Street and Buster Midnight. How they grew up, what they we're like and the relationship between all of them. And it's quite a story!<br /><br />This is a really hard book to put down. If your a fan of Ms. Dallas you'll LOVE this story. I was very sad to see it end. I really recommend this book, and only hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.	2004-07-30

Well, it took me a few days to finish this book, I wasn't really able to get into it all that much, but once I finished it I started to like it more and more! Thinking back on all the quirky, eccentric folks of Higby, Mississippi, I was a little disapointed there wasn't more to read.<br /><br />The book is about Labor Day weekend in the small town, and the going-ons in some of towns peoples lives. The chapters are real short (3-5 pages) and each focuses on a different person. There's Carmen, in love with the handsome Tie who doesn't know she exists...Stewie and Marci, who's relationship is tested, Pastor Cullen who's son Clint falls from the Higby water tower, both of whome are trying to move on after the loss of a wife and mother, and so many more!<br /><br />I recommend this book as a light fun little read. You'll really enjoy the craziness and quirky drama of the folks from Higby, Mississippi.	2004-07-27

I totally expected this book to be a gossipy, sex-filled trashy kinda of book when I started reading it...and that's exactly what I got. There was absolutley NO substance to this book what-so-ever. The three lead women are shallow, annoying, and whiney.<br /><br /> First you have Miss 'Diva' Lola Sanchez who's all about extracting revenge on Linc Blackwood for a one-night stand that happened years ago and she can't seem to get over. Shelby, (who's wish-washyness got real old after a while) trying to deal with her husbands infidelities. And Cat, who once she started hanging around with Nick Logan REALLY got on my nerves...(You're so crazy!...No, you are...No, you're the craziest...aaaghh!)<br /><br /> The only part in this book that was even mildly entertaining was wondering what would happen between Matt Seel (Lola's husband) and Tony Alveraz (Lola's lover and ex-boyfriend). Trust me, save your time and read something (anything) a little more stimulating, because this book just isn't it.	2004-07-27

I had no idea what I was getting into that afternoon when I sat down to read this. This is a great story of friendship, love, and and grief. A bit dark and depressing at times, it's still a very entertaining read.<br /><br />  The basis of the book is four 'Grand Dames' as they call themselves. Each have problems of their own...one's abused, one's a cheater, one's the cheated, and two end up dead (you learn that in the first 5 pages, I'm not giving anything away!). The characters become people you feel you've known forever.<br /><br />  There were only a couple things I didn't really like. One being that you CANNOT read one page without someones 'eyes welling up', crying, sobbing, or feeling 'tears at the corners of their eyes'. Everything was so dramatic (some things really were, and crying was called for, but every little thing? C'mon). Also I don't think the whole court room scene was very plausible. I honestly don't think the verdict would have been what it was. But hey, that's just me.<br /><br />  Overall, I really enjoyed this book. The pages fly right by, and you continue to think about these women long after you've read the last page. A great book for women that I would recommend to my friends.	2004-07-20

RARLEY do I read mystery/thrillers...but a friend mentioned she wanted to read this, and after looking it up, it sounded really good. I'm so glad I bought it! This book kept me up very late for 2 nights in a row...but it was worth it. I love the format of the book, being all journal entries from Ellen's diary...starting in 1907 (age 19) till 1928.<br />It's a fascinating and riveting journey into the life of Ellen and her philandering husband John, and one cannot forget Rose Red herself. You go on to read about the demise of Ellen's sanity, and how their palace of a house starts to take on a life of it's own. It's an excellent book all around. I highly recommend it. To those who read thriller/mysteries all the time, this is probably no big deal...tame stuff. But for someone like me...it was the perfect amount of suspense and creepiness.	2004-07-18

I think my main problem with it was that I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Not even a little. Emily is 47 yrs. old (I'm 23), has 4 kids (I have none), and her marriage is in a rutt after 20+ yrs. (I've only been married for a year). The only thing I could identify with was we both live in Connecticut. It just wasn't a stimulating book.<br />All Emily can think about is the love of her life Jim, whom she hasn't seen in 30 yrs. They had a 4 month summer fling back in 1967 and she feels he's the 'one-that-got-away'. Anyway, she tracks him down and they make plans to get together, and the story goes from there (I don't want to give anything away, so I won't elaborate).<br />When I finished this book I thought, well, that was nice I guess, but I also felt it was kinda a waste of time. I didn't really get anything out of it. When I closed the book I though, well, another book read, and that was that. I didn't give it another thought. A good read if your looking for a 'filler' book, but don't sit down and expect anything great...you'll be disapointed.	2004-07-16

Make sure you have a box of tissues! The setting (Lake Geneva) sounded beautiful. The only problem I had with this book was that it seemed a little rushed. I felt there could have been so much more as far as the actual letters to Jennifer. I figured that'd be the majority of the book, but Sam's story was only a small part.<br /><br />Regardless, it was sweet, and it definitely has been drilled into my head that Jennifer is &quot;the most beautiful girl in the world&quot;...(it got a bit old after a while). Anyway, aside from the few small downfalls this book has, I do recommend it. It's a great summer story.	2004-07-09

The book starts off with a ferry accident that leaves only Julia, Noah, and Kim alive while 9 others are killed. It deals with the personal struggle Julia goes through to find her true self, and why she was spared, as well as the other two. There's also a little mystery thrown in about how and why the accident happend in the first place.<br />I must say though, sometimes Julia's wish-washyness got on my nerves, and I found myself wanting to yell at her to stand up for herself...but I think that's good when a book gets you so involved in the characters and their lives. I really recommend this book to anyone's that's interested...it's a wonderful little summer read that will hold your attention from the first page to the last.	2004-07-08

After reading both of them I think Little Altars Everywhere was MUCH better. Ya-Ya dragged on, and was sorta boring. There were some good parts though, like all the flashbacks of Vivi in her younger days, but Sidda just annoyed me in this book.<br />Everything that is wrong in her life is instantly blamed on her mother. She may not of had the best childhood...but it wasn't awful, and Vivi is surley NOT the root of all her problems. It just gets old afetr a couple hundred pages of her whining and self-doubt. I definiatly recommend Little Alters, and if you want to know why Vivi is the way she is, then Ya-Ya as well, but it takes a lot to get there.	2004-05-02

I thought the Ya-Yas where a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky kinda group (I'm basing this on the few previews I saw of the movie)...but no...not at all. I didn't expect constant drunkiness, child-abuse, and cruelty. It did make for a very entertaining read though...as awful as that sounds.<br />I couldn't put the book down! The messed-up world of the Walker family is funny, tragic, happy and sad all in one. I really recommend this book. I've just picked the 'Divine Secrets', and am really looking forward to what more this family can get themselves into!! Definitely a must read!	2004-04-19

It really wasn't the 'laugh-out-loud' book I was expecting. I definitely think the CD would be a million times better. I just didn't think her little comments after each message were very funny. Maybe for a stand-up act...but not when your reading it. I think Amy's Answering Machine is something that needs to be heard...not read.	2004-04-13

Hometown Tales is another book full of wonderful tales about life. Beautiful stories that remind us to sit back for a second, look around us, and take it all in. Philip Guelly truley understands what it means to appreciate the little things in life. His stories get you thinking about the all the things we take and have taken for granted...about memories long past...and how to make this life a little better for ourselves. And most importantly, he always remindes you that there's someone up above looking out for us.	2004-04-13

This was a wonderful little book about love, friends, family and faith. I don't normally read religious books, but this book left me feeling really good. Mr. Gulley has a wonderful sense of storytelling. He's never preachy, and he's very humorous without trying to be. I've just picked up the sequel to this book Hometown Tales...and though I've only read a couple stories in it...it's just as wonderful. I recommend Mr. Gulleys books to everyone. They won't disappoint you!!	2004-04-08

I just happened to pick up this book on a discount shelf at the airport, and I'm really glad I did! I'd never heard of this author before, but it sounded like a nice book, and it definitely was. This is a great story about family, love, and the circumstances that test both of them.<br />There is a large cast (there's 7 people in the Jones family alone) and it took me about half-way through the book to finally quit mixing up the boys (Jason, Jack, and Joe)!!...but they were all wonderful to read about.<br />This book really covers a lot, and I think almost anyone could enjoy it... from family and true-love, to rape, murder, and mystery, it has it all. This was truly a great find and I'll certainly read much more by this author!!	2004-04-07

I thought it was pretty good, but I'd say about 70% of the book was about Bobby Moore and his family and friends, not so much about Grace. I kept wanting to know more about Grace and Bucy and what lead to his leaving her...but no detail was really given, and his response to her asking why was pretty lame.<br />  In fact, almost every problem in this book was solved with a simple answer and a wave of the hand. I wanted more detail about some issues that truley could have been more entertaining had they been a little more in depth.<br />  As for the ending, I don't know how I feel about it. Part of me says...'Well, it COULD have happened that way...I guess'...the other part says...'What the heck?!?!? What kind of ending was THAT! Could she have wrapped it up any quicker?' I don't know, I like the book, it made for a pleasant and thoughtless read just to pass time, but I don't know that I'd really recommend this to anyone I know.	2004-03-30

I loved reading about Smith college in the 1950's and how Joan and Joe first came to meet. I wasn't very interested in in anything that happened in Finnland.<br />The ending of this book left me a little irritated though. I finished it thinking...&quot;What the heck?? Why did I read through all that just to end up here?&quot; It seemed like the easy way out. There was no real confrontation, no big fight, no getting it all out.<br />But it was the last line in the book that did it for me. It contradicted the entire book. What she says in the last line is NOT how she feels throughout the whole book. It really felt like a waste. But overall, besides the ending, those last 5-10 pages, it was a decent read. As I said...it has it's moments.	2004-03-22

I don't read many mystery/thrillers, but I liked this one. It's my understanding that this isn't a typical novel for Mrs. Fielding, that most of her stuff is much lighter and not so...twisted. Either way, I'm looking forward to picking up another one of her books. I liked the writing style, it flowed nicely and made the book fly right by.	2004-03-22

I am a huge fan of Sandra Dallas, but I will say, after getting about half-way through this book, I really wasn't impressed. The stories of Addie and Ned just kind of mosied along, nothing overly exciting, but once the book turned to Emma's tale...wow!!<br />I truly didn't realize just how much everyone was out to screw  each other over, and the way everything went down was completly surprising! This really is a great book, I only gave it 4 stars because as I said, the first half was a little slow...but stick with it! The last half will make the pages fly by!	2004-03-11

I thought it was great...Vix and Caitlin were wonderful entertainment! I'm not sure I believe that Vix would continue to be friends with Caitlin after all the awful things she does to her...but who knows. It made for good reading.<br />  I was a little annoyed with the ending, (which is why there are only 4 stars here) I like to know exactly what's going on, and have a solid ending to the books I read, I didn't like the big question mark hanging over the end of this book.

After reading all the wonderful reviews this book received, I was extremely excited to read this series, so I bought all 3 books and got to work. Well, I was not overly impressed.<br />I took me a week to finish this book, I just couldn't get into it, no matter how much I forced myself to sit and read it. It moved verrry slow, and the characters were just so-so. I kinda never really got to like Ave Maria, she irritated me, and Jack Mac didn't have much of a personality at all, but there were some other characters that I thought were ok...Pearl, Iva Lou, and the Italian family. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, just not great.<br />Trust me...I'm really bummed about not loving this book. I'll still read the other 2 seeing as how I've already bought them...hopefully the story will pick up a little though.	2004-02-26

Zippy is such an energetic little thing, it was nice reading about a childhood that was enjoyed (I just finished Running With Scissors not to long ago...wow).<br />Some of the animal scenes wern't the most pleasant to read about, but then again life isn't perfect, and animals do meet unfortunate ends. If you can't handle it, don't read it. I highly recommend this book, it really was a great read, and I'm looking forward to her newest novel, Something Rising.	2004-02-19

I really enjoy light southern living books, and this one was great. I liked how each chapter was a different summer in Roxannes' life, starting at age twelve, and ending with her in her forties. For such a little book (only 10 short chapters), I felt like I'd read about Roxies entire life! A great read if your looking for something light and quick.	2004-02-13

I'm a big fan of books with multiple narrators (Saving Graces, Future Homemakers of America, ect.) This one was just as good.<br />It's pretty much the story of 2 sisters, one who can do no wrong (Clancy Jane), and one who can do no right (Dorothy), their mother, and their daughters. I have to admit, sometimes I felt sorry for Dorothy (though other times I wanted to kill her), and it really wasn't right that no matter how many times Clancy screwed over her loved ones, they always welcomed her back with open arms.<br />My favortie though was Violet...good for her!! She didn't come from the most stable of environments, but she was the most normal person in the book.<br />Overall, a great read...for women. You become so engrossed in these womens lives, that you can't put it down.	2004-02-11

Mattie is a true heroin in this book. It may be a bit of a stretch believing just how MUCH Mattie had to endure out on the prarie, but it was a good story nonetheless, not as good in my opinion as Alice's Tulips, but close behind. I highly recommend!	2004-02-07

The book consists of letters Alice is writing to her sister during a 2 1/2 year time period that her husband Charlie is away fighting for the union in the civil war. It's amazing to see just how much young Alice grows up in those 2 1/2 years. Living with her mother-in-law, Alice starts out very prideful, wasteful, and immature, but by the end of the book she has grown so much, for the years were not easy on her. I highly recommend this book. A great read.	2004-02-05

I found it to be pretty funny, but I did have to keep reminding myself this all actually happened to someone. It's a sobering thought. That aside though, the people poor Augusten had to grow up with are quite entertaining and amusing, as well as sad. I highly recommend this book, and can't wait to read Dry, but be prepared for some messed up stuff.	2004-01-29

I'm not big on the whole 'Christian Fiction' thing, but there was absolutely no preaching in this book. The pages go by pretty fast once the HMS Archer comes into play. I will say the beginning did lag a bit, but it was necessary for character build-up. I love Naval history books, and this was pretty interesting, as well as suspenseful. I will definitely read this authors works again.	2004-01-24

The whole side story of Adams brother Leo was never really detailed...what exactly were all the books he was reading, and hiding from everyone, and why? What was the shattering secret that reached back centuries? These and other questions were not explained.<br />  It was also at times a bit difficult to follow. When starting a new chapter, a couple days to a few years may have passed, but you didn't know it when starting the chapter. You just have to figure it out.<br />  Overall, it was a very nice story, Adam was made out to be a bit more of a hero then was called for, but the characters were very nice to follow. I recommend it if your bored and just want a fast read.	2004-01-12
