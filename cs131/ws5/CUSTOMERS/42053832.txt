Getting Over the Blues is one of the most hopeful books about a subject Christians often shy away from. Leslie's writing is personal, practical, informative, and, most of all, filled with hope. This is a must read for counselors, pastors, those who are experiencing depression, or anyone who cares about someone who needs to understand that God wants her to feel normal and joyful.	2005-06-06

The Purse-Driven Life is a hoot. My plane was delayed after getting a copy of this book and thanks to Anita's hysterical observations I didn't mind at all. What I love about this book is that it's proof positive that God not only has a sense of humor but that he also loves for us to use that humor. The Purse-Driven Life is filled with issues that all women can understand. It's also filled with reminders of how much God loves us. I've already recommended this book to lots of ladies when I speak to women's groups and will continue to do so. This is Anita's first book and hopefully the first of many.	2005-03-22

It also proves that Tricia Goyer is not just a one book novelist. The intricacies of weaving four plots together makes for a fun read. Tricia's research and attention to detail are obvious with this book as it was with From Dust and Ashes, her first WWII novel. I love books that are well written with fleshed out characters, interesting plots, and something for me to learn. Night Song has all this and more.

Because I have a book on grief coming out in March 2005 I am reading various books so I am familiar with different resources available. Writing about grief is different than experiencing it, and Sandra's book helped me get through a couple of rough spots.  <br /> <br />Sandra's honest sharing of her own pain after the death of her husband helps readers feel like they aren't the only person who has ever dealt with such difficult feelings. Combining heartfelt stories, practical tips, and spiritual wisdom, Will I Ever Be Whole Again? is a perfect book to either purchase for yourself or to give as a gift to someone who has lost someone they love. <br /> <br />I especially like the format of short sections and the simple reminders at the end of each chapter.

Profound in its simplicity.  <br /> <br />When Someone You Love Has Alzheimer's is a comforting message of hope for those caregivers and other family members who deal with years of losing a loved one through this insidious disease. Divided into seven sections , this  book is designed to give daily encouragement of less than a page. This is important for the caregiver with an already too full place. What I love about this book is the conversational tone that sounds like Cecil and the reader are sitting over a cup of coffee while chatting about a common challenge. <br /> <br />This book doesn't try and fix something, but it does comfort, educate, and let the reader know they are not alone in their struggles. Most of all it lets the reader know that through it all God is there for them. I've added it to my short list of recommended books, not only for those dealing with Alzheimer's, but for anyone caring for someone with a related dementia.	2004-09-04

I justified my lack of notes by remembering that I had sons. Sons don't respond to gimmicks like love notes, I thought. Then I read about Linda's son and how much he valued those notes. More guilt. Thank goodness I kept reading. By the end of the book I was excited about how I could use love notes with my adult children who are living far from home. I realized that the same concepts that Linda used so wonderfully with her kids are concepts I can use with my sons, husband, mother, and even with my siblings. <br /> <br />Love Notes In Lunchboxes is a delightful book filled with personal stories, notes from kids about how much lunchbox boxes meant to them growing up, tons of great holiday examples, and ideas for every situation imaginable. There are even blank love notes parents can copy and use for their own children. <br /> <br />For those who have kids or grand kids, will have kids, or have other family members you want to encourage, this is a must have book. If you are active in the PTA or any other group of parents please recommend they promote this book. It's usually the simple, free things that make a difference in the lives of our children and this book is an excellent example.	2004-09-04

In this first book of the series Wendy Lawton does a fantastic (imagine Jane's faux British accent saying this) job of creating characters that are multi demensional. Only the mother of a senior girl could have written a book that paints such a perfect picture of the pressures of senior year.  The excitement of Olivia being on the show was wonderfully written. But it was even more fun to see how her character had grown to the point of being able to share the experience with others. I loved every minute of this book and plan on getting a copy for each of my nieces and donating a copy to our church your group.

This is much more than the facts.  Inspiring seems such a simple word for this marvelous book, yet it is inspiring in so many ways. I particularly like the way she wove in Anita's forgiveness for her father. It's a testament to God's grace that this little girl grew into a young lady who could forgive. Each character is real and complete and added much to the story and the lessons being taught.

Don't forget to breathe is how she wants her readers to remember her books, and because of being a triple threat she achieves her goal. Brink of Death is a fast read with a sympathetic heroine.

For The Rest of My Life continues the story of Dr. Claire McCall as she moves through her journey of self discovery. In the first book, Could I Have This Dance?, Claire learned that she is at-risk for Huntington's Disease. Claire wrestles with finding out her results and what it will do to her relationship with the man she wants to marry, but also with her career. I found her response to the disease, the testing, her father who has HD, and other conflicts true to life. <br />As the author of two non fiction books about Huntington's Disease and as a frequent speaker at HD conferences, I found the portrayal of the disease authentic. I like that the book focuses not only on the romance but on real- life issues and conflicts. <br />The Pacing was excellent and Dr. Kraus did an solid job of weaving the various story lines together to make for an engaging read. I found the characters realistic for the most part, and while I did manage to solve the mystery in one of the stories before it was revealed, I still enjoyed the way it played out.<br />Dr. Kraus once again did a great job at weaving faith into the novel without being heavy handed. The issues that Claire and others went through ate the same as what people are dealing with every day.  This is a book I will recommend to the members of the Huntington's Disease community and others. <br />Carmen Leal, Author of Faces of Huntington's and Portraits of Huntington's, Choosing Joy Through Life Lessons	2004-05-27

Because I've known Louise for several years through an online group, and I got to meet her at a writers conference, I decided to read at least a few pages of Grace By the Cup.<br />From the first page to the last I kept thinking of coffee drinkers who will love this book. Thanks to Dumont's insight and style, I forgot I didn't like coffee and enjoyed the devotionals far more than I thought I would. The anecdotes in Grace by the Cup lifted my spirit, but more importantly, they drew me closer to God. The brief bits of wisdom in each chapter were perfectly matched to appropriate scripture verses. These were Dumont's stories, not mine, yet each page reminded me of God's grace in my own life. <br />Reading Grace by the Cup is like sitting with a treasured friend over a cup of coffee, or some other beverage, and discussing life and how much God loves us.

What many authors will find helpful is the \\"To Do List\\" type of approach so that each day something significant gets done to promote the book. <br />Can every book be a best seller? As Reiss explains, best seller means different things to different people. If the book is well conceived and well written, and the author implements the basic marketing strategies outlined in this book, then success is possible. The addresses and Web sites along with actual dollars costs make this book a handy reference tool that will be used beyond the 30 days it takes to make a book a bestseller.	2003-06-11

I write books for writers. I am on nine writer email discussion lists. In each area where I interact with writers I find those who want to have written a book. They don't make the time, don't do the research, and they don't have a plan. The Publishing Game: Publish a Book in 30 Days by Fern Reiss is a book I will recommend often because it is a plan complete with all the details needed to make the dream of finishing a book a reality.<br />The step-by-step approach is great for someone who has trouble staying on task. It's also perfect for anyone who wants the correct information in one place. It's obvious that Reiss knows the publishing business and aspiring authors would do wise to follow her lead. <BR>  <BR>This is an excellent guide for those who want to write a book and become their own publisher. The book assumes the reader knows how to write so it doesn't get into the actual writing of the book, This book also seems to be more geared to those writing non fiction. The book is more user-friendly than any book on self publishing I've come across. Reiss has done a wonderful job of pulling together information on every possible area of self publishing and anyone who is serious about the publishing game would be smart to run to the nearest outlet, online or brick and mortar, and buy a copy.	2003-06-11

I am continually looking for new tools to share with writers and speakers who are trying to market themselves and their products. This book is now a featured book on my Web site and in the reference section in my handouts. <br />Ideas, tips, and strategies are packaged in an easy-to-read book. I love the fact that those featured don't just talk about success, they go out and grab it. Confessions of Shameless Self-Promoters is motivational and fun and doesn't make a person feel guilty for what they haven't done. Instead it inspires them to do something every day to further their goals.<br />At first I didn't like the title because I hate self promotion. I look at the most effective promotion as building relationships. Once I started reading the various chapters I realized the title is actually misleading because every person in the book preaches relationship building. Networking, referrals, branding, Internet marketing, direct mail, media, and more or covered in depth and well by some of the top people out there. I highly recommend this practical resource for anyone regardless of their business or product.	2003-06-11

I decided to review this book as a favor to my friend, Deb Haggerty. Deb is a sharp business mind with an expertise in networking and as she is a featured author I decided to see what she had to say. I am glad that I read the other chapters in The Sales Coach because I learned a lot that I didn't know and looked at other things in a new light.<br />I owned a marketing firm for 10 years and while I am good at sales and marketing, this book proves there is always something new to learn. Besides Deb's excellent chapter on networking, there are also sections on listening, goal setting, time management, and more. These articulate professionals have much to share in their area and because of the variety of people involved I feel confident in saying that there is something for everyone in The Sales Coach.<br />Deb Haggerty's chapter on networking is relevant to everyone who aspires to greater success in their chosen field. She said, \\"Networking is a state of mind. Always keep in mind those people you know to whom you can refer others. In order to receive the benefits of networking, you must give first.\\"	2003-06-11

Better yet they will learn valuable insights about dealing with the media. There has always been a mystique about the media, that somehow they are greater beings than mere mortals. Mathis easily puts that to rest through his personal stories and often humorous examples. Mathis knows the media and is generous in his willingness to share. <BR> <BR>Once anyone with a product to sell or something to promote figures out that the media need US they will be halfway to meeting their goal. Knowing how the game is played, and how important we are to them, is what Mathis does an excellent job of teaching. <BR> <BR>Prepare. That is the key principle that Mathis shares and that we need to remember over and over. The media can be intimidating and daunting if we allow it, but with the information in Feeding the Media Beast it doesn't have to be. The media should be our best friend and after reading this book you'll feel much more confident and remember that they need us.	2003-06-11

Her ability to weave historical fact and fiction into a book of such richness is a true gift. <br />Wendy's writing is an outstanding example of show don't tell and she does just that phrase by phrase, page by page. I could smell the close quarters and feel the ocean billow. I was on that ship with Mary Chilton thanks to Wendy's incredible writing. <br />As with the previous books in the Daughters of Faith series, Wendy has proven herself a master of dialogue. I also like the way she stretches her readers to learn more with the use of new words with definitions in the back. <br />Now more than ever young readers need to understand that our country was founded on faith and courage. All of us would do well to remember the religious persecution, the dreams, the losses and everything else that went into making America. <br />Like her other books, Wendy's research is evident on every page. I wish every school, every homeschooling parent and every church and public library would invest in the Daughters of Faith series. <br />Thank you, Wendy, for your diligence and for sharing your faith through the story of Mary Chilton.	2003-03-26

Thanks to Laura I am no longer dreading menopause!  Laura is not only funny but wise in her writing, and she has done a delightful job of bringing the inevitability of menopause down to everyone's level. As she says, the alternative is something I'd rather not think about.<br />What I love about Laura's writing is that the chapters are bite-sized for busy lives. I also love her freshness and the way I can easily give her books to friends going through the same situations. Many of my friends are not Christian but they all love Laura's style and I can't help but think God's words touch people exactly where they need to hear it thanks to Laura's humor.	2002-09-03

I am not easily impressed by most books, but Night Whispers is an absolute treat. <br />It's hard to believe this is Jennie's first book because the writing is so accomplished and inviting. The book's concept is equally compelling. Jennie obviously knows and loves God's word and her desire to share her experiences with other women shines right through.<br />I love the way she introduces modern day stories as she leads back to the bible and shares observations that are as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. The other wonderful thing she does is to give \\"homework\\" in such a gentle yet inviting way we want to read and learn more. <br />Thank you, Jeannie for your lovely book.. From the cover to the layout to everything else this is a must read and reread book for women of all ages.	2002-09-03

I have to admit to not being a major ice cream person, and<BR>I'm more of a sour patch girl than a chocolate fiend, but within a few<BR>chapters I wanted to be on a first name basis with both Ben and Jerry.<br />This little book packs a lot of wisdom inside stories. I like having a<BR>book I can give to non Christian friends who are dealing with difficult<BR>situations.Through the Rocky Road is not filled with Christian jargon or<BR>deep theological debates. It is filled with humor and God's word.<br />Whether you have been walking with the Lord for decades or you have yet<BR>to meet Him, this is a wonderful read.	2002-07-31

Lauraine Snelling knows how to tell a story and I<BR>enjoyed each and every character. The Healing Quilt has real characters<BR>with real problems. I've never lost a child, but I can only imagine how<BR>difficult it must have been for Lauraine to write this book. While it<BR>wasn't a biography, or even based on her own loss, each word she typed<BR>must have brought back memories of her own daughter. Thank you, Lauraine<BR>for writing what I know is a book destined to help many people.<br />I love how she included Aunt Teza's cancer journey along with Beth's<BR>struggles in coming to terms with her abortion years before. These are<BR>real-life issues and Lauraine dealt with them in a real way. Her<BR>dialogue is fresh and the range of emotions the characters experience<BR>are honest.<br />This is a book I can't wait to share with friends who have or are<BR>experiencing something similar, or even those who want to support<BR>someone else.<br />Lauraine is a wonderful writer and I look forward to reading many more<BR>of her stories.	2002-07-31

As the author of two non-fiction books<BR>dealing with this devastating disease, Faces of Huntington's and<BR>Portraits of Huntington's, I'm always interested in seeing how other<BR>writers discuss the symptoms and people dealing with HD.<br />I had never read anything by Susan Wittig Albert but you can be sure that<BR>after Bloodroot I will be reading more. I loved the characters, the<BR>mystery, the descriptions and just about everything about the book. I<BR>was prepared to get out the red pencil and critique the sections dealing<BR>with the disease. Happily, I never took off the cap! Susan's research<BR>certainly paid off. Her portrayal of the symptoms, both mental and<BR>physical, was dead on. And China's questions and emotions once she<BR>realized she was at-risk for the disease mirrored the reactions of many<BR>of my friends when they learned the news.<br />I loved Susan's description and I felt like I was on that plantation.<BR>The air of mystery permeated and I stayed up far too late turning pages<BR>to get to the next logical place to stop. I did guess the mystery sooner than I woudl have liked, ... Thank you, Susan, for your sensitivity and willingness to add the little<BR>details that made these people alive.

Everson and Chadwick have done just that and the reader benefits. <br />Summon the Shadows is a fast paced read picking up where their popular book, Shadow of Dreams, leaves off. I liked the development of Katie's character and how, with God's help, she was able to take over the posh hotel after her husband's disappearance. Skillfully-written fiction can teach many life lessons, and through Katie, we learn that we can grow through our grief and shattered lives.<br />Some readers prefer the more obvious Christian fiction, but I loved the carefully woven message of God's love, strength, and hope intertwined with real-life characters and situations. This is a book I feel comfortable suggesting to non Christians because I know they won't be turned off by an excessive amount of \\"God talk,\\" yet they will be able to find Him in the carefully chosen words.<br />I loved the way they wove the tragic events of September 11 into the story. The authors used the events as a way of showing character growth and helping us understand that we all need to do something in the face of unspeakable evil.<br />The plot is easy to follow but leaves enough clues so that when the surprising punch line is delivered we're not disappointed. <br />Summon the Shadows is an entertaining read that shouts, \\"We're a new breed of Christian fiction.\\" Life is full of twists and turns and Everson and Chadwick do an excellent job of showing the One who will get us through what can be a terrifying maze. <br />Summon the Shadows is an excellent read with outstanding dialogue, believable characters, and an interesting plot. I'm looking forward to the next installment and finding resolution to the questions so expertly posed in the epilogue.	2002-06-19

Of course I knew of John Bunyan and Pilgrim's Progress, and I knew it had been written in prison, but that's where my knowledge ended.<br />As writers we are told to make the reader hear, see, smell, and touch what's in the story, and Wendy has done just that. She has brought history to life with all the senses and the reader is the beneficiary. I've never really thought about what it must be like to be sight impaired, but Wendy painted such an excellent picture of Mary, who was born blind, that I felt as if I had at one time been blind so I knew exactly what Mary was feeling. How powerful.<br />Wendy has a delightful way of telling a story bursting with characters and color. In this book she made me understand the myriad of emotions felt, not just by Mary, but by her siblings, father, step mother, and her new gypsy friends. <br />Mary's struggle to feel like she can do all things herself and not depend on anyone else is one that I have struggled with. If the truth be told, I still struggle with it. I learned much from Mary Bunyan, and was just as thrilled with her acceptance of the Lord as if she was someone dear to me here in 2002.<br />I read The Tinker's Daughter because Wendy is my friend. I came away from this book a better person and a fan as well as a friend. This is a must read for children and a double must read for adults.	2002-05-27

Her attention to research and detail, coupled with her easy-to-read style, kept me turning the pages until the book was done. I hope this is the first of many books because we need books that introduce our children, and re-introduce adults, to historical figures of faith.<br />Wendy Lawton was courageous to write a book using so much dialect, because that is more difficult than most people realize. She did a skillful job of bringing her characters to life with not only dialect, but with word choices and flow. All slave owners weren't on the same economic or social level, and Wendy did a wonderful job of allowing me to know who was talking and more about their character. She did a great job of giving every person in the book their own voice and she painted vivid pictures.<br />With the richness of description, she masterfully made me feel \\"Minty's\\" pain and confusion and faith. We often think of our inspirational heros, and Harriet Tubman is certainly that, as being made from stronger stuff than we. In Courage To Run we see a young girl who doubts her courage but never her God. Harriet Tubman was courageous and her story is inspiring.  Adults can learn as much, or maybe even more, than young people from this wonderful book.	2002-05-26

(Claire McCall Series #1)	Books	5	15	15	N	N	An Excellent Book	This is the best fiction plot involving Huntington's Disease I have ever read. Dr. Kraus did an excellent job with his research to be able to include so many issues that invariably arise when dealing with this neurological disease. His portrayal of the young intern, Claire, struggling with being at-risk for a genetic disease, was dead on. He captured many issues that one has to consider when deciding to have genetic testing. Issues such as discrimination, insurance, having kids, future job performance, her relationship with her fiance, and many more are covered in Could I Have This Dance? His descriptions of the physical and mental symptoms of Huntington's Disease were excellent. <br />I enjoyed the plot and found myself thinking of people I know who need to read the book.  As the author of two non-fiction books about Huntington's Disease and a frequent speaker and HD conferences, I was impressed with the details and how well he wove them into the plot. I was a full time caregiver for husband with HD and the founder and facilitator for HDCaregivers, an online support group for those who caregive loved ones with Huntington's Disease. Because of my continued writing and speaking to HD groups I am often asked to endorse books that have some connection to Huntington's Disease. I usually find major flaws or omissions in these books and am reluctant to endorse them. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to read and enjoy Could I Have This Dance? and to be able to give it a five star rating.<br />For too many years Christian fiction was boring, badly written or didn't ring with authenticity. What a delight to find that in recent years Christian fiction has changed for the better. Dr. Kraus did an excellent job of weaving faith issues into the plot without being preachy or heavy handed. So often it is when a crisis arises that one begins to question God and why bad things happen to good people. Even non Christians should be able to read this book without flinching because Could I Have This Dance? shows a young woman struggling with sin and with her relationship with God, just like we all do.<br />The plot moves at a nice pace and has enough tension and twists to satisfy any reader. <br />Thank you, Dr. Kraus for creating an excellent book that I am excited to share with the thousands of families suffering with Huntington's. I also hope millions who have never heard of HD will read this book because it is an honest, well written look at the issues surrounding Huntington's Disease. It is also a honest look at how flawed human beings and how much we need a sovereign God.<br />Carmen Leal, Author of Faces of Huntington's and Portraits of Huntington's, Choosing Joy Through Life Lessons	2002-04-26

I have read several books on creating characters, including books by renowned Hollywood script consultants, and none of them comes close to being as unique, helpful, and well written.<br />Brandilyn has a great teaching style in her writing and she uses perfect examples to explain the Method acting theories and how they can help novelists create characters whose traits are integral to the plot and not just an afterthought.<br />I can't write a glowing enough review of Getting Into Character. Brandilyn's book is helping me to dig deeper into my characters, to understand not just their motivation but the psychology behind that motivation. I can already tell that many of the struggles I've been having will no longer be a problem thanks to this book.

Too often people try and cut corners and they don't do justice to their work because of it. Can You See Me?

I almost looked past the words in my eagerness to get to more pictures. I'm so glad I didn't. Anyone and everyone can relate to the powerful words in the poetry and prose. I am not a poetry person but this is more than poetry. This is truth, transparent and haunting. <br />The layout is wonderful with tons of white space to showcase the pictures and set off the words. I loved the little touches like the screened words in a larger font. This book is simply a visual treat.<br />Karen's own honesty about difficult issues in her life inspires me to face my issues.
