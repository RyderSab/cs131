BUT, the ability to communicate developed before the physiological ability to speak developed, which means that some form of sign language preceded oral language. It's an interesting theory, and Stokoe makes his case well.<br />The book is quite readable and full of interesting anecdotes about his experiences and the history of sign language. He also does a good job of highlighting the many reasons that defining language in terms of something that is spoken is a misguided concept. Instead the grammar, action, actors, meaning, etc., that make up language can be expressed verbally in a language like English or German or they can be expressed equally well in language like American Sign Language or French Sign Language.	2002-02-25

This is not to be read so much as a comprehensive history examining the social issues or complexities of the expansion of British rule out of India and into the North-West Frontier (now partially in Afghanistan and partially in Pakistan), but as a true-to-life \\"boy's adventure\\" story. The tale is of John Nicholson (one of Allen's forbearers) and the other Young Men who, under the guidance of Henry Lawrence, help spread the reach of the East India Company.<br />And what a tale it is: culture clashes, petty bureaucrats, noble savages. Allen draws heavily upon the letters, diaries and reports of the principle heroes of the tale, leading to a history that is drenched in Victorian stereotypes and ideals. With this caveat in mind, however, Allen does a great job of bringing the modern reader into the world walked by Nicholson and his compatriots. The writing draws in the reader with fantastic tale after fantastic tale, starting with a brief biography of Nicholson and of the East India Company and ending with the lifting of the siege of Delhi during the Sepoy Rebellion. There are lots of vignettes highlighting life in the service of \\"John Company\\" and the British Empire and the inevitable culture clashes that occurred across the subcontinent.<br />Oh, and for those keeping track at home, the subtitle \\"The Daring Adventurers Who Tamed India's Northwest Frontier\\" appears to be the work of a copywriter at the U.S. publisher, Carroll & Graf. The original U.K. subtitle is \\"The Men Who Made the North-West Frontier,\\" which doesn't have as much flash, but doesn't seem as harsh as \\"tamed.\\"<br />(Reviewed copy was the 2001 paperback version, printed in the U.K. by Abacus.)	2002-02-06

War to the Knife provides a very vivid look at the conflict between pro-slavery and free state settlers in Kansas in the lead up to the Civil War, drawing heavily from personal accounts and local newspaper reports. This approach also helps Goodrich maintain a balance in presenting the views of both sides of the conflict, their hatred of each other and their diametrically opposed agendas. The one area where the book was lacking was in its discussion of the role of the federal military and government in the conflict. Goodrich does discuss the few times the military did intervene in the conflict and the lack of power that the multiple territorial governors had over the settlers, but I found myself wanting to know more about why the military and government did not take a stronger role in preserving law and order in the territory. Despite that, the motives of the various free state and pro-slavery leaders are discected fairly well -- especially John Brown whose raid on Harpers Ferry is used to open and close the book.	2002-01-14

More of a brief engagement than a battle, the back and forth between Union and CSA troops left much of the city in ruins and empty as both sides soon pulled back to more defensible sites.

From a brief overview of the colonial days of the region to its short-lived Republic of West Florida to its eventual incorporation into the state of Louisiana, the Civil War and through Reconstruction, Hyde explores the social and economic tensions between the wealthy planters nearer to the river and their neighbors to the east.<br />These economic tensions (and the resulting political manipulations) helped create a culture of violence in the region that lasted well past Reconstruction. As the final chapter of the book outlines, Hyde's own family was involved in a long-running feud that claimed several lives. The personal details interwoven into the history (and the many photos he was able to include) add to the depth of the work.	2001-12-10

Hudson has been intimately involved in combing through the journals and reports of the De Soto expedition, cross-referencing the reports with examinations of the geography of the areas covered and archeological/anthropological studies of the 16th century inhabitants of the region.<br />Hudson's approach to the expedition is interesting. He is a partisan arguing in favor of the route he delineates for the expedition, but he lays out the journey in a fairly straightforward manner that is very engaging. The Afterward, however, gives a quick rundown of the differences in opinion over the route, the still-unfolding evidence to support Hudson's claims, and what remains to be proven.<br />All it all, it is a vivid retelling of the first planned European expedition into southeastern North America, which was quite a different place than when much of it was colonized by Europeans a century later. The native cultures were near the end of the moundbuilding Mississippian culture, and Hudson notes how the disruptions of De Soto and his men may have contributed to the eventual changes in native society.<br />Fascinating.	2001-08-06

In a very readable style, he gives an overview of how the South chartered privateers and how the North reacted before delving into the construction and history of the Alabama. He also does a good analysis of the actual impact the ship and its comrades had on U.S. shipping interests around the world. All in all, a top-rate look at one of the most infamous ships of the Civil War.	2001-06-11

Part of a delicate diplomatic dance designed to stave off foreign support for the Confederacy and to bolster the international presence of Russia, the fleet visits were just part of the U.S.'s foreign policy moves that helped keep foreign powers from interfering in the U.S. Civil War. Drawing heavily upon the papers of Baron de Stoeckl, Russia's minister to the U.S., Woldman does an excellent job of exploring the motives and goals of diplomats from both nations. All too often foreign policy is overlooked in treatments of the Civil War, and it is a shame that Woldman's book has been out of print for so long.	2001-06-11

Brasseaux's examination of the development of the Cajun identity during the 1800s is an interesting social history, but its format leaves a little to be desired. Instead of following things chronologically, he examines changes in different aspects of Cajun society -- economic life, social class/status, political participation, crime/justice/vigilantism, folklife, etc. -- in isolation. While this does lead to an interesting, in-depth analysis of these aspects of society, it also makes for jarring reading. This focus shifts, however, in the chapter on Cajun reaction to the U.S. Civil War. According to the introduction, this was Brasseaux's original area of interest, and it shows. He does an excellent job of illuminating the general indifference to the Confederate government and the government's many attempts to draft Cajuns into gray uniforms.	2001-06-11

The first two-thirds or so of it focus in depth on the ill-fated final voyage of the Fredensborg as it traveled from Denmark to Ghana to the Virgin Islands and back to Scandinavia, where it sunk off the coast of Norway. Because of the detailed logs and letters of the crew, a great deal of insight is given into the day-to-day shipboard life of the crew throughout the journey. The final third of the book traces the modern underwater archaeology involved in recovering the ship and journeys by the author to St. Croix and Ghana. Much of the second part of the book dwells on the fate of those who were enslaved and carried across the Middle Passage, something that is glossed over in the first part due to its reliance upon the crew logs, which made little mention of the ship's human cargo.<br />All in all, it is an interesting read because of the vast amount of detail included from the ship's logs and because very little seems to have been written in English about Dano-Norwegian involvement in colonization in the Americas and in the salve trade. Also in the book's favor are the lavish illustrations, including reproductions of the logs, period maps and sketches and contemporary photographs of the sites.	2001-04-02

Even during the U.S. Civil War, the Union managed to hold an effective election that could have been much closer than it was. Waugh does an excellent job of examining the 1864 election, the players, the minor issues, and the overall effect that reversals and gains on the battlefields of the South and West had on Lincoln's fortunes.<br />As a reporter (as opposed to a historian), Waugh writes with a minimum of analysis, preferring to retell the events and to sketch the outcomes in a straightforward manner that proves very readable. This \\"historical reportage\\" approach lends itself well to both illuminating the past and allowing the reader to draw parallels with modern electoral campaigns and politicians.	2001-01-25

He manages to chronicle the early days of technical diving in a manner that is accessible and interesting to the nondiver, linking the modern sport with the history of diving.<BR>Some might be put off by some of the technical details about the uses of various gas mixtures, but I think it would be hard for anyone to not be drawn in by the gut-wrenching descriptions of living through decompression sickness (&quot;the bends&quot;).<BR>While the descriptions are vivid, the book could have been bettered by the addition of a few maps (the site of &quot;U-Who&quot; is shown on a nautical chart that serves as the endpapers of the book, but a clearer map would have been nice) and the lack of an index was at times irritating.	2001-01-20

Actually, the region covered includes a wide number of encounters and battles, as well as the capitals of both the Union (on the shore of the Potomac) and the Confederacy (on the shore of the James).<br />The book opens with the early skirmishes in Maryland, notably the Pratt Street Riot in Baltimore and the occupation of Annapolis by Ben Butler, before moving on to cover the Delmarva Peninsula and a variety of naval encounters in the bay, including the clash between the Monitor and the Virginia. Adding to the interest of the book is the detailing of smuggling and secret mail routes throughout the region. The book is richly illustrated with period photos and drawings, although there could have been a few more maps.	2001-01-15

From iron-clad ships to rifled artillery to aerial observation, the military effort expended by North and South changed the face of the industry in the United States. Victory Rode the Rails looks at one aspect of this change -- the railroads and how they helped the North win the war.<br />From the early skirmishes in Baltimore to the final rail movements surrounding the surrender at Appomattox, Turner does a magnificent job of making the railroads of the 1860s come to life. By keeping his focus on the railroads and their role in the various campaigns, Turner highlights a side of the war that is commonly glossed over in histories that focus on battle tactics.<br />Starting with the differing North/South attitudes towards railroads prior to the war, which left the CSA with a rail network that was ill prepared for the rapid dispersal of troops and supplies that the war required, Turner celebrates the business plans, engineering feats and supply marvels that allowed the Northern commanders to continue their advances even as Southern troops worked to destroy the rails, and vice versa.	2000-12-11

Much more than a list of names and meanings, Joal Ryan weaves together pop culture references and Generation X sensibilities to highlight the plusses and minuses of traditional and more ... interesting names.

As Crouch notes in the introduction, Haydon conceived Military Ballooning During the Early Civil War as a two volume work and there are occasional parenthetical/footnote references to engagements that were to be covered in that volume.<br />That being said, the book is fascinating, even if it only covers through 1862. Starting with a brief history of ballooning and its adoption by various military leaders during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, Hayden outlines the skepticism of U.S. generals during the Seminole Wars and the Mexican War and how they delayed the adoption of military balloons. Moving into the bulk of the book, Hayden builds on these earlier hesitancies to show how slow Union generals were to form a balloon corps and the difficulties Lowe, LaMountain and others faced in getting the army understand the value and difficulties of using balloons on the battlefield.<br />A great joy in the book are the extensive footnotes. Only a handful of pages lack them and Haydon uses the notes to provide additional information, context, and recollections, as well as sources. Haydon's love of detail is not constrained to the notes, however; he gives exacting details about the cost, materials, and staffing of the balloon corps, based upon archival records and receipts. It is a wonderful look at a little-known aspect of the Civil War and a good study of how reluctant military leaders could be to adopt/understand new technologies.	2000-09-26

Every description of Jackson fawns over his political acumen, his skills,  his bravery, etc. And, as mentioned in another review, as soon as Jackson  wins the Battle of New Orleans, \\"the Hero\\" becomes a synonym for \\"Jackson\\"  for the rest of the book. Setting aside how brightly the portrait of  Jackson glows, Remini's biography is an excellent introduction to the man  and the age he ushered in. From the tales (some of which are duly noted as  apocryphal) of his youth to his battles with Congress and foreign powers  and, of course, the showdown with South Carolina over tariffs during the  Nullification Crisis, Remini manages to hit an ideal balance between  surface details and analysis for a popular biography. And while Remini does  act the apologist at times, he does little to sugarcoat some of Jackson's  more unsavory ideas and traits. All in all, a solid, quick introduction to  life of Jackson.	2000-09-08

Denton provides some interesting numbers and analysis to support his thesis  that Marylanders were inclined to join the Confederacy, detailing the  general pro-Southern nature of the state.

Western North  Carolina -- long home to violent familial feuds -- found itself greatly  divided in the 1860 elections and the early days of the Civil War. Although  the use of force by the U.S. to keep the South in the Union caused many to  join the Confederates, pro-Union sentiment in the region was still present  in the form of desertion from CSA service, &quot;draft dodging,&quot;  fleeing to behind Union lines, and active guerrilla resistance to the  Confederacy.<br />Stevens does a fine job of examining the home-front violence  in Appalachia during the Civil War and in illuminating the story of the  Blalocks. The book is quite well balanced, noting atrocities committed by  the Blalocks and their enemies, as well as shortcomings in the actions of  U.S. and Confederate troops and officers. And he does it all in a manner  that draws the reader in.	2000-08-21

Organized by  theater of operations instead of chronologically, there are some moments  where the events of one chapter seem odd in the context of the previous  chapter, but this is a minor flaw. Probably the most interesting chapter is  the all-too-short discussion of CSA-USA conflicts on the high seas and  around the world; it is interesting to read about the delicate dance naval  officers played in ports as far away as Brazil and France. Musicant is  obviously a fan of ironclads, and a great deal of the book is devoted to  their use in various campaigns. He gives equal time to their successes and  shortfalls.	2000-08-15

Almost existential in  describing the human character, Hikmet's verse-novel is fascinating to  read, both for the stories of growth, love, loss, politics and dreams that  make up the novel and for the beauty and simplicity of the poetic  form.<br />Hikmet began Human Landscapes in 1941 while in prison and finished  it by 1945. Like the wartime works of Sartre and Böll, Human Landscapes is  greatly influenced by World War II, the sense of despair in the face of the  cold technology of war and the heroism of individuals who stand up for what  is right.<br />In the Forward, Denise Levertov notes that Human Landscape is  an epic, both in its length and it scope.

However, Greg Marquis has done an excellent job of examining how the conflict between the North and  the South shaped the lives, fortunes and eventual push toward confederation  of the people of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward  Island.<br />Using newspaper reports, letters and other primary sources,  Marquis crafts an illuminating tale of shifting perceptions among the  Maritimers in terms of how they viewed the war, race, and the balance of  trade in the region.<br />Much of the book is devoted to the Chesapeake and  Tallahassee incidents (where Confederate privateers commandeered US ships  and ended up in Maritime ports, creating difficulties for British  authorities determined to remain neutral), but Marquis goes beyond these  incidents to delve into the familial and trade ties that bound the  Maritimes to the North and the South, as well as into the role the  provinces played in hosting blockade runners the various espionage and  diplomatic missions of the warring states.	2000-07-31

She also tracks its influence, growth and spread across the Caribbean and  around the world. Linguists and others interested in the growth of language  (especially when the growth is partially shaped by a sociocultural agenda)  should find Dread Talk an interesting read. Especially illuminating are the  discussions of the ways new words are formed and the illustrations of these  processes from Rasta poetry and reggae music.	2000-07-25

With this one caveat, I must say that The  Confederados is fascinating. Despite the occasionally kludgey back and  forth references to other essays and chapters (and the repetition of  material), the Dawsey's have assembled a fine book that examines the impact  and legacy of post-Civil War immigrants from the U.S. South to Brazil; it  also points out the contributions of other immigrants from the North and  Europe who came to Brazil at roughly the same time. Especially interesting  is the memoir of a Confederada, written late in her life, but rich in  details about her childhood exodus from Alabama and the difficulties in  getting to and starting a new life in Brazil. Also interesting is the study  of the preservation of Southern dialect by the Confederados.	2000-07-19

Although the title doesn't immediately suggest it, that is what Sex in the Snow is all about. Michael Adams has delineated the divisions of modern Canadian society into three  generational groups and a dozen &quot;social values tribes.&quot; What  makes the book especially interesting is the way he highlights connections  and tensions between the various tribes and then extrapolates what it all  means to Canadian society. The central message is that &quot;demography is  no longer destiny,&quot; that the contribution/influence of any group or  tribe is not intrinsically tied to their numbers, and that  self-determination and self-identification plays a powerful role in  constructing society. Although the thrust of the book is Canadian  demographics, those south of the border will find the comparison between  Canadians and their counterparts in the U.S. quite enlightening, too.	2000-06-13

But wrapped around this history is  Doucet's own story as the child of an Acadian father and an English mother  who was caught between their two very different worlds.<br />Doucet is a radio  reporter and his sense of narrative is impeccable, but while he makes Notes  from Exile an interesting read is the intertwining tales of Doucet's youth,  the 1994 Acadian World Congress and the history of the Acadians. As  frustrating as it sometimes can be, this blending of tales helps underscore  how the events of 1755 remain relevant to Acadians nearly 250 years later.	2000-06-13

The thrust of this effort -- just like the thrust of Milam's book -- is to bring new voices and issues to  airwaves.<br />Milam was one of the early pioneers in radical, non-profit  broadcasting. He formed the KRAB Nebula of stations that competed with  Pacifica for the far left of public radio. Sex and Broadcasting gives an  overview of what it takes (or at least what it took in the '60s and '70s --  the technology and regulation of radio have changed significantly since the  book was published) to start up a station and to give it reason.<br />Milam  contents that broadcasting, like sex, requires passion and devotion. At  times the book reads like a Yippie manifesto, but when Milam starts talking  about the power of radio, one cannot help but be swayed.<br />Whether or not  LPFM takes off the ground (Congressional efforts are seeking to limit/block  its introduction) remains to be seen, however the lessons of Sex and  Broadcasting could easily be applied as easily and effectively by a  webcaster as a traditional over-the-air broadcaster.	2000-06-02

I can't think of enough positive things to say about this book. Riedman manages to give readers a thorough overview of the biology and habits of sea lions, seals  and walruses. The book is encyclopedic in its scope, but you do not have to  be a biologist or naturalist to appreciate the details it covers. And then  there are the pictures: maps, photos, line drawings and other illustrations  help bring to life the various pinnipeds Riedman discusses.<br />Divided into  nine chapters, the book covers their adaptation to life in the sea, their  evolution and classification, their ecology, predation, diet and food,  mating and social structures, reproduction and life history, maternal care,  and communication and learning. And while this is a biological text, the  writing is breezy and readable, mixing anecdotes and personal observations  with the multitude of facts.	2000-06-01

The first half is a wonderful in-depth look at life on the frontier during the 1800s that goes back and forth with comparisons of the living conditions, clothing,  social beliefs, etc., of Native Americans and the whites who were moving  through/into the West. The second half gives a good overview of sites of  historic interest, museums, battlefields and more. The one thing I found  frustrating (and I can't think of a good solution McDermott could have  employed) is that the &quot;guide&quot; section of the book does include  some good history information, too: It seems that these instances were  included in the second half of the book to discuss localized events that  might have seemed out of place in the more generalized first half of the  book.	2000-05-30

Charged with the near impossible task expelling the Native Americans who had moved into the  swamps of southern Florida, the military had to develop new ways of  bringing warfare into the swamps.<br />Buker tells in a relatively dry fashion  the changes in naval strategy that occurred during the war and which would  end up playing a role in later conflicts throughout the mid 1880s. The  culmination of these changes was a coherent strategy for riverine warfare  that employed a mix of sailors, soldiers and marines using shallow draft  boats that could navigate their way through the swamps. All in all it's an  interesting slice of military history.	2000-05-25

The book is well written and gives a compelling portrait of this corner of Atlantic Canada, but at times  the history seems to barely dent the surface.<br />Arranged in 45 short  (usually four- to five-page) chapters, Choyce covers Nova Scotia from the  geologic prehistory of the land through European colonization and into the  fish wars of the 1990s. Throughout it all he manages to strike a nice  balance between veneration of important historical figures and lamentation  of the wrongs imposed upon the environment, Native Americans and  others.<br />Although Choyce obviously doesn't love everything that has been  done by the people of Nova Scotia over time, he does love the province --  something that shines through in the brief historical vignettes of this  book.	2000-05-24

However, the book is laced with lots of analysis and attempts  to draw connections between the way typhoid was treated/viewed in the late  1800s and early 1900s and with how AIDS has been treated/viewed in the late  1900s. These connections are valid and interesting, but the manner in which  they are scattered throughout the text become a bit distracting.

Not so A Traveller's History of North Africa.

From assassination plots on both  sides of the USA-CSA border to new weapons and even a failed attempt at  germ warfare, Garrison has uncovered a staggering array of tales. Some are  relatively well-known, such as the development of ironclad warships or John  Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry; others, however, will be less familiar such  as Northern attempts to undermine the Southern economy by printing fake CSA  currency or a Southern plot to use infected clothes to spread yellow fever  in the North. The essays are organized into six broad themes (\\"Best-laid  Plans;\\" \\"Genius at Work;\\" \\"Bizarre as a Byzantine Novel;\\" \\"Nipped in the  Bud;\\" \\"Much Ado About Nearly Nothing;\\" and \\"Flood Tide of Fraternal  Strife\\"), which makes sense, but I found myself sometimes flipping around  trying to piece together the chronology of events and how they flowed from  one to the next.

The stories turn equally tragic and humorous with deft  turns of Gautreaux's pen.<br />In Welding With Children, Gautreaux devotes a  fair number of the stories to older people caught in a modern world not of  their making, yet they manage to find ways to reach out to (in the case of  the title story) their grandchildren, to neighbor youths, or even  strangers. The old Cajun woman and her bourée playing neighbors who end up  outwitting a would-be robber/murderer is an especially delicious  tale.<br />However there are other stories -- such as the one about a camera  salesman who develops old rolls of film in used cameras his shop buys in  search of found art, or the one about a minister/would-be novelist at a  writers' conference -- that illuminate other corners of the soul.<br />This,  and Gautreaux's previous work, should put Hammond, Louisiana, on the  literary map.	2000-04-24
