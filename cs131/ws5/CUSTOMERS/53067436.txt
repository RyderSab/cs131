Basically, the story says that there is a cabal of men (and women too, I suppose, though Twelve Hawks doesn't mention any) who really rule the world, and they are opposed by people who are born with the potential to travel between universes - travelers, they're called - who by their very nature have the ability to effect changes in world affairs. <br /> <br />Devotees of \\"The X-Files\\" will devour this book and its potential sequels lock, stock, and barrel.  And just like that TV series, I'm sure they will find more questions than answers.  But if you didn't like \\"The X-Files\\", or never really cared to watch it, you probably won't go for \\"The Traveler\\".	2005-10-13

The latest in Elizabeth George's Thomas Lynley novels, \\"With No One As Witness\\", delivers a shocker about 3/5 of the way through the book.  It's an event that, quite frankly, you will never anticipate, and it's completely unnecessary to the plot, unless Ms George got tired of the way Lynley's life was going and wanted to be able to move him off in another direction.  We'll have to see what happens in her next book - if indeed there is a next book. <br /> <br />That being said, and that plot twist aside, this is an excellent addition to one of the best British police procedurals being written today.  Lynley and his two primary assistants, Barbara Havers and Winston Nkata, have never been more human, more alive - especially considering the subject of this latest entry in the series.  George writes her story with great tact, and most of what she says on the subject is implied.  Of necessity there are some scenes that may turn your stomach, but these are kept to a minimum and George does not draw out her descriptions of these scenes. <br /> <br />Considering the hue and cry that emerged when this book came out, I will anxiously be awaiting news of the next book in this series - although as I said before, I wonder.....	2005-10-01

First, Isabel Allende's memories of Zorro are of the Disney version.  There is a Bernardo in her book, but Tyrone Power did not have a Bernardo backing him up in the movie - but then again, neither Power nor Guy Williams (the TV Zorro) had an Isabel or a Lolita as a love interest. <br /> <br />Second, while this is an extremely good novel, don't read it with the expectation that it's similar in any way to any of Allende's other books.  \\"Zorro\\" is completely unlike anything else she has ever written.  The other Allende novels I've read have been more similar to, say, Gabriel Garcia Marquez in tone and plot, although Allende's other novels never had the mysticism of Garcia Marquez's wonderful tales. <br /> <br />For this book, Allende has gone off in a completely different and enchanting direction.  Where she borrows from the known Zorro legend, she borrows accurately - the characters of, for example, Moncada and Garcia were completely accurate, and I could picture them in my head as they were in the TV series.  Where she goes off on her own, her story is totally believable and logical. <br /> <br />I find myself hoping that Allende will write a sequel, but I know that it will never happen.  I do hope, though, that this book will bring about a resurgence of interest in Zorro.	2005-09-21

None of them are bad, but the short stories pale beside the novella (the title piece).  This story gives me goosebumps, because it's in this one that Owen sounds so much like his father.  And that's not altogether a bad thing, considering that as I said before, there is no element of horror in any of Owen's stories.  One has to wonder just what Stephen could do with some of these pieces. <br /> <br />If this is any indication of his talent, I'd say that Stephen has a worthy successor when he deems it time to hang up his word processor.	2005-09-14

But he doesn't have Eddings' style or flair - in fact, he's downright dull in spots. <br /> <br />And his first novel has one far more serious flaw - he doesn't explain the history or the culture behind his book.  For example, it took me close to a hundred pages to find out what a Seon was, even though they're mentioned in the first few pages of the story. <br /> <br />Sanderson is definitely a good writer, but he needs more lessons in his craft.	2005-09-04

But that's exactly what happened. <br /> <br />Michael Blake's book reads as though it was written for a junior high and high school audience.  That doesn't stop it from being a well-done tale of life on the prairie in 19th-century America, although why Costner made his Indians Sioux instead of Commanche as written by Blake is beyond me. <br /> <br />Aside from that difference, Costner obviously followed Blake's novel almost to the letter; I felt as if I was seeing the movie all over again.  But Blake's writing style is something of a disappointment.  After seeing the movie I was expecting a much more detailed story of John Dunbar's transformation into Dances With Wolves - something on the order of James Clavell's \\"Shogun\\".  If you picked this book up looking for information on how Native Americans lived back in their glory days I suggest you look elsewhere.  But if you're looking for a well done Western this is the book for you.	2005-07-05

It doesn't miss a beat and there are no skips in the story.  But when you compare this story to the original trilogy by the late Robert Ludlum, it's like looking at a piece of paper instead of a block of wood - there's just no \\"there\\" there. <br /> <br />I had no problem with the character of Khan and who he turned out to be - Ludlum's plots always required you to suspend your belief in the logical and the ordinary, so that didn't matter one bit.  But van Lustbader doesn't flesh Khan out at all, and makes too big a deal out of his reason for pursuing Jason Bourne.  And unlike in Ludlum's books, there are no characters in this story with any redeemable values whatsoever. <br /> <br />If I want to visit Jason Bourne's world again I think I'll open one of Ludlum's books.	2005-04-27

He wrote \\"The Godfather\\" and all his other books in a style that spoke to \\"the common man\\" - he didn't use high-falutin' words, and none of his characters were sophisticated, urbane men about town.  Those that on first glance appeared as that type of person proved to be either as phony as a three-dollar bill; or came from somewhat questionable backgrounds and worked very hard to conceal their true origins.    Mark Winegardner has copied Puzo's style to a T, yet has at the same time raised the level of that style to reach a wider audience.  And with all that implies, he hasn't strayed from the descriptions, personalities, and emotions of the characters Puzo laid out so memorably in \\"The Godfather\\", and which Francis Ford Coppola brought to such vivid life in the first two \\"Godfather\\" movies.    With all that, however, I think that Winegardner has gone as far as anyone can go with filling out the untold history of the Corleones and their fellow-travelers.  It was nice to visit with Michael and Tom and all the rest, but I think I'd like to let them rest in peace.	2005-02-17

He appears to have his own sense of right and wrong, which are - to put it mildly - quite separate and apart from that experienced by the rest of the citizenry of Cotton Point, GA (not to mention the majority of the people in the country). <br /> <br />It is this unusual sense of morality (I'm not sure it can be called perverted, offbeat, or any other similar term) that leads to his shooting of a young African-American girl.  And it is that circumstance, and the resulting trial, that causes the gradual emotional disintegration of not only Paris Trout, but of many of the other main characters of Pete Dexter's unbelievably good tale. <br /> <br />Trout's wife, Hanna, could probably be considered a battered wife.  I'm not entirely sure - Trout does strike her, and the psychological abuse is certainly there, but Hanna has enough gumption to fight back (emotionally speaking), and to throw Trout out of his own house and begin divorce proceedings against him.  Perhaps if this story had taken place several years later, Hanna would simply be a doormat - a Hedda Nussbaum clone.  But given the ultimate resolution of this story we'll never know that for certain. <br /> <br />Without trying to give that resolution away, I wish that Dexter would write a sequel of sorts.  I would like to see Hanna five, or even ten years later and see what kind of a person she has become.  There are far too many Paris Trouts in the world, and it would be a comfort to know that their control over their victims is not absolute.	2005-02-02

But Klavan has added an extra undefined something to the story - something that puts it more than a cut above your average detective novel.    True, the people are stock characters - the hard-boiled private eye who was once a cop; his partner, who's still on the force and has the personality of a crab; the gorgeous damsel in distress (who we never actually get to meet); and the prototypical arch-villains.  But they all mesh together and you enjoy knowing what happens to them.  I've read many other similar stories - some published in the 40's, some fairly recently - and a lot of them I just discarded because the people in them were basically cartoon characters.  Not here.  I hope the next novel in this series (and the cover indicates this is the first of a series) tells us a bit more about the damsel in distress, and about the mysterious Shadowman and his relationship with Weiss.    Oh, and if the author is the Drew Klavan whose twin brothers I grew up with a few blocks down the road, and he reads this - tell those brothers I said hello.	2005-02-01

And it is massive, coming in at just under 800 pages. <br /> <br />The plot is far too complex to go into here, and it has been done by other reviewers before me.  But this novel has all the ingredients of a Dickens story - a noble hero (although I will admit that Clarke's definition of \\"noble\\" is somewhat at odds with Mr Dickens'), a damsel of pure heart in thrall to a man of evil (here there are actually two such ladies, and owing to the subject matter the evil does not reside in a man), and interesting supporting characters whose names describe their personalities to a T. <br /> <br />Reviews that I have read of this book, by both professional reviewers and others, have described this book as an adult \\"Harry Potter\\".  It is nothing of the kind.  In fact, although the general subject of both this book and JK Rowling's series are the same, to compare these two is to compare apples and oranges. <br /> <br />That is not to say, however, that \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is a bad book.  Far from it, but you should be prepared to read it from a completely different viewpoint than you would a \\"Harry Potter\\" novel.	2005-01-27

There were many questions that were asked in that book that were left unanswered. <br /> <br />Some of those questions are answered in the second book in Douglass' series, \\"Enchanter\\".  We learn more about the mysterious Azhure, one of the two loves of Axis' life.  We learn (or guess, at least) who the Dark Man has to be - Douglass doesn't come right out and say so, but I would be very surprised if my guess is wrong. <br /> <br />But there are still plenty of unanswered questions in this series, and Douglass still has a third and final book in which to answer them.  For example, is the hint she gave about the traitor in Axis' camp that glaringly obvious, or is this just a red herring?  And now that Faraday has given up her pursuit of (but not her love for) Axis, what exactly is her role in the prophecy? <br /> <br />Douglass has a lot of balls juggling in this series.  So far she hasn't dropped any of them, and I hope she can catch all of them in the final book of her trilogy.	2005-01-08

James mystery.  Lady James is just too good a writer to have that happen. <br /> <br />\\"Original Sin\\" continues her series featuring the man I consider the world's most erudite policeman (the word \\"cop\\" just doesn't apply) - Commander Adam Dalgliesh of New Scotland Yard.  This time the scene of the crime is, according to the novel, the oldest publishing house in Britain - Peverell Press. <br /> <br />In this entry in the series, enough red herrings are tossed out that I was thoroughly in the dark until the very end - and then I remembered the actual murderer's alibi in the first killing and wondered how I could have forgotten it. <br /> <br />Sadly, I cannot give this book five stars, but not because of Lady James' usual excellent writing.  My review is of the audiobook from Recorded Books, and the narrator needs to improve on his craft.  At times, in conversations between two or more characters, I couldn't tell which one was speaking - they sounded almost exactly alike.  And other points in the narration were flat and toneless; I almost felt as though I were listening to \\"Original Sin\\" as told by Mr. Spock. <br /> <br />I'm willing to give this narrator another chance, but I'm seriously considering getting the actual book for my next P.

If it isn't feudal Japan, it's the closest thing possible, and despite the indication in the author's note I prefer to assume that it is Japan. <br /> <br />The story reminds me in some ways of the plots and themes of some of Kurosawa's films.  The main plot and the various sub-plots are far too involved to go into here.  Suffice it to say that this is a book that is well worth your time if you are a lover of fantasy or of things Oriental, and if this is any indication of Hearn's talent I look forward to the next book in the series. <br /> <br />There does seem to be a mystery of sorts surrounding the author.  I went to the websites mentioned in the book ([...] and [...] and what little those sites told about the author has me very intrigued.

Deaver does need to go back over his notes in \\"how to write a mystery novel\\", though - his Lincoln Rhyme novels are proof that he knows how to do it, but so far his non-Rhyme stories look like they were written by a completely different, completely amateurish person masquerading as Jeffery Deaver.

The blurb on the back cover was what prompted me to buy it in the first place; I'm a sucker for good \\"advertising\\" like that when it comes to fantasy novels.<br /><br />But, surprise!  I opened to the prologue, with the unlikely title of \\"Brother Cy's Apocalyptic Traveling Salvation Show\\", and was instantly hooked.  This is a well-written beginning to a six-book cycle, which apparently concerns threats not only to the other-dimensional world of Eldh, but also to our Earth as well.<br /><br />Anthony does not seem to develop his two Earthly protagonists too well.  I could not get a clear picture of Travis; one could compare him to Clark Kent just beginning to discover his powers, but that's a very broad generalization.  And Grace Beckett strikes me as a Vulcan transported to the world of fantasy who is beginning to learn about her emotions.  There is also a strong indication that she was abused in some way in her childhood, but nothing definite is mentioned.  Hopefully Anthony will expand on their characters in later volumes.<br /><br />The residents of Eldh, however, are much more fleshed out and well-defined - the Lady Kyrene seemed very sinister, King Boreas is a little more intelligent than his hulking appearance makes him seem, and Durge and Beltan are just a bit more than the standard noble defenders of the realm.<br /><br />Of necessity there are some characters who are cloaked in mystery.  Falken the bard and the Lady Melia, as well as Queen Ivalaine pose more questions than answers at this point.  Exactly who are they, and what do they know?  Are they trying to save Eldh or do they have other purposes in mind?<br /><br />I do not see even vague similarities to Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series here, despite several reviewers' claims.  In fact, there are far more similarities to David Eddings' \\"Belgariad\\" and \\"Mallorean\\" cycles than anything else.<br /><br />I look forward to the next book in this series.o the next book in this series.	2004-08-16

As the country entered the 1950's, the religious and secular worlds started to undergo a change and a blending the like of which had never been seen before, and probably will never be seen again.<br />This process is seen in microcosm as Potok continues his story of Reuven Malter, now studying to become a rabbi, and his best friend Danny Saunders, the Hasid turned psychology student.<br />The most interesting thing about this story to my mind is that the roles of the two main characters are, to some extent, reversed.  In &quot;The Chosen&quot;, Danny was the religious one - rebellious in his own way, but still religious; and Reuven was the more worldly one.  Here, Reuven is moving into the religious world, and Danny is becoming more and more secular - so much so, in fact, that he becomes engaged to and eventually marries a woman he falls in love with, rather than the arranged marriage that his family would have set up for him.<br />The secondary plots of Danny's prospective cousin-in-law and his emotional problems, and Reuven's conflict and bonding with his Talmud instructor, are also interesting, but it is still the interplay between Danny, Reuven, and their fathers that is the reason to buy this book.  Even if you're not Jewish, this story will speak to you.	2004-05-04

Reuven has an easier time of it because of his father's opinions on the course world Jewry must take; Danny has a much more difficult time, because of his father's opinions on that same subject.  Danny is also hampered because of his father's expectations for him, while Reuven's father is more accepting of his son's intentions.<br />Potok takes these basic points and fashions a powerful story that comes along only once in a lifetime.  In this case, twice in a lifetime - because its sequel, &quot;The Promise&quot;, is every bit as good as &quot;The Chosen&quot;.	2004-04-16

He and Nighteyes, the wolf whom he has Wit-bonded with, are now living far from the court where Fitz grew up, and raising the orphan boy Hap.  But it seems that court intrigue will just not leave them alone.  One day Fitz's mentor, the assassin Chade, pays him a visit seemingly out of the blue.  A few days later the Fool, the mysterious former jester of the court, drops by and stays for several days.<br />This is only the beginning of a story that does contain magic, but it is really more about a man who has never truly been able to live on his own, without having to answer to anyone; and about a boy who has much in common with the young FitzChivalry Farseer and who needs to learn about growing up in a hurry.  In that, it is truly a story of a major aspect of the human condition.<br />As I said, there are also many magical aspects of this story.  The telepathic ability known as the Skill is explored in some detail, and the mystical man-to-animal bonding called the Wit in even more.  And the book also delves into some mysteries that are left unanswered - hopefully they'll be answered in the other two installments of this trilogy.  The most prominent of these is, who exactly is the Fool?  He is a being of many talents and many faces, none of which appear to be his true one.  We want to know more about him, but every statement he makes about himself, though apparently true, poses more questions than answers.<br />This book is a complete story in and of itself, but I definitely want to read the other two installments, if only to (hopefully) discover the secret of the Fool.	2004-03-24

But somehow some of the intensity of the novel got lost in the translation to the screen.  That's not to pan the film by any means; it's just that you'll get a much bigger emotional wallop out of the book.<br />I won't go into the plot; it's been reviewed too many times and if you've seen the movie, it follows the plot pretty faithfully (except for a few minor variations at the conclusion).  Jimmy Marcus is both less intense and more calculating than in the movie, even in spite of the fact of his daughter's murder.  Sean Devine seems almost obsessed with solving this case, and his partner and sergeant, Whitey Powers, is totally at odds with the image I had of him from the film.<br />But it's Dave Boyle who had the most impact on me.  In the film, he seemed to me to be a victim of circumstances, brought about by the fact that he lied about several key points of his whereabouts the night of the murder.  But in spite of that, he seemed to have some control over his life.<br />On paper, though, Dave appears to be someone who should be pitied - someone who has no control over his world or his life, and someone who is just swept along by the tides of other people's actions.<br />This is definitely a must-read - but I would see the movie first.	2004-03-10

Is &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; science fiction?  If so, it's one of the most unique science fiction stories I've come across in quite some time - but the premise is somewhat outlandish, even for science fiction.<br />Is it a love story?  That's a bit easier to answer - it's definitely a love story, but not like any love story I've ever read.  There are stories of love across time - Diana Gabaldon's series, for one - but the people in her stories stay put for the most part.  Audrey Niffenegger's main character, librarian Henry De Trimble, jumps back and forth from present to past, and in some cases from present to future, at what seems like the drop of a hat.  Niffenegger maintains her chronology, though.  She never varies it or suddenly changes it; her only deviation, if you can call it that, is to present several incidents throughout Henry's life from different points of view.<br />Her main thesis - that Henry's time travelling abilties are somehow genetic in nature - is really sheer nonsense, but if you let go of your scientific assumptions and believe in her premise, this is a wonderful story that is sure to become a classic.  Henry is a librarian who apparently travels along the timeline of Claire Abshire, the woman who is destined to be his wife and the mother of his child.  He visits her as a little girl, as a teenager, and as a woman grown.<br />And there is definitely room for a sequel, since it's no secret that Henry's daughter, Alba, has the same ability as her father - except that sometimes she can control where and when she travels to.<br />This is definitely a story worth reading, and it has the potential for being a great movie - if the right person can be found to tell it.	2004-03-05

For several years he has written far below his abilities.  The man who wrote such masterpieces as &quot;Ghost Story&quot;, &quot;Shadowland&quot;, and &quot;Floating Dragon&quot; produced truly awful books with names such as &quot;Mr X&quot; and &quot;Koko&quot;.<br />Now, however, Straub has returned to his glory days with his latest work, &quot;Lost Boy, Lost Girl&quot;.  And while the style is typical Straub, the story is quite different than you'll be used to.  Because the horror in this story is solidly based in reality - a serial killer is on the loose - but there are definite elements of a typical ghost story in this novel.  The difference is, the spectral elements in this Straub novel do not have evil intentions.  Selfish intentions?  Possibly, but they are most definitely not evil.<br />There are two distinct stories going on here.  One is the search for the aforementioned serial killer.  The other is, basically, fifteen-year-old Mark Underhill's search for the purpose of his existence.  He's helped along in this, after a few false starts, by the ghost that lives in the house behind his.<br />The conclusion of this second story is, of necessity, a sad one.  It's also somewhat unfulfilling.  But I doubt that we've seen the last of Mark Underhill.	2004-02-06

That setting is the Channel Island of Guernsey during World War II.<br />Germany has occupied this and the other Channel Islands for several years at the time this novel opens, and there is an uneasy peace between the island's inhabitants and their temporary German masters.  Then the daughter of one of the island's most influential families is found murdered, beginning a chain of events that threatens to literally blow the lid off of the fragile truce.<br />Aside from the exploration and investigation of the murder, there is a fascinating interplay between the Germans and the islanders.  Not all of the Germans view themselves as conquerors, the so-called \\"Master Race\\" - and not all of the islanders view themselves as conquered.  Indeed, some are quite ready to live with the current situation - but not all.<br />I was also fascinated by the fact that Hitler is not mentioned by name from the German point of view for most of the book.  Instead, the German characters refer to him in the Biblical sense - that is, when they think of Hitler at all they refer to him as Him or He, with a capital H.  From my own point of view that is, admittedly, quite repellent, but looking at it from their standpoint it was quite understandable.<br />This is definitely not a book for everyone.  But if you're willing to take the time to get into it you won't be disappointed.	2004-01-28

Andrew was created by the former dominant soul, Aaron, to take over that role because he (Aaron) was exhausted from dealing with all the other souls in the body and from building the \\"house\\" that they all (but one) now reside in.  It would take more space than is available in this review to explain about the \\"house\\", but Ruff explains this rather interesting concept extremely well.<br />The story deals with Andrew's getting his \\"house\\" in order, so to speak; his interaction with a fellow, \\"immature\\" victim of MPD, Penny Driver; and his discovery of several things in his body's past that could potentially cause Andrew to lose his place as the dominant personality.<br />I was extremely impressed with Ruff's ability to establish each soul with its own distinct personality.  He must have done quite a lot of research on the subject to be able to do this.  And to do it with two people (Andrew & Penny) is nothing short of amazing.<br />Penny and her souls are somewhat weaker characters than Andrew and his, but considering Penny's state when Andrew first encounters her that's hardly surprising.  Julie Sivik, the woman who brings Andrew and Penny together, seems to me to be a bit of a caricature - she definitely has her own psychological hangups (as does everyone in this book, to one degree or another) - but she is definitely essential to the story, as you'll see.<br />As you read this book you'll encounter quite a few surprises along the way, including one that had me reeling for quite a while - suffice it to say that Andrew and Julie do not get together, despite all the indications Ruff throws at you up to that point.  Towards the end he even throws in the elements of a mystery novel.  That part of the book is somewhat weaker than the rest of the story, but it's still a vastly entertaining novel and one of the strangest stories I've ever read.<br />From other reviewers I get the impression that this is not at all similar to other fiction Ruff has written.  I'm wondering if Ruff can be pigeonholed into any particular category of fiction.  I'll pick up another one of his novels and find out.	2003-10-26

All of the people he describes are fully realized individuals, from Trick the Dwarf and Gyp the Blood (don't you love those names?) down to Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, who did indeed visit the US around that time for a series of lectures.<br />My personal favorite in Baker's collection of characters is Big Tim Sullivan, one of the high muckety-mucks in New York's Tammany Hall political machine - and boy, does he have character.  To be sure, Baker's description of him is full of a lot of the old Irish stereotypes - but you still can't help liking the guy, for the simple reason that his heart is in the right place (well, most of the time, anyway).<br />The only flaw in Baker's tale is his description, toward the end of the book, of the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.  That lacked much of the emotion and punch of the rest of his story.<br />I'm eagerly looking forward to Baker's next book.	2003-10-17

But the joy of this book is not in the mystery, but in the writing.<br />I've read several of Ms George's Thomas Lynley novels prior to this one, and I have to say that I've never learned as much about Lynley, his wife Helen, and the other principal characters in this series as I have after finishing this entry.  She describes their emotions and their lives in extremely intimate detail, and were it not for the fact that the main plotline of the book involves a series of murders I would seriously consider thinking of this as a novelization of a high-class &quot;Eastenders&quot;.<br />And even though the murderer's identity was clear from about the midpoint of the book I have to confess that some of the red herrings George inserted did throw me for a while.  The insertion of Gideon Davies' diary/notebook was also a nice touch, though the timeline of those sections was a bit confusing at times.<br />If you're looking for a well-done mystery, I would suggest you look at one of George's earlier books.  But if you're looking for a well-rounded, well-done novel of any kind, then even at 1000+ pages I would heartily recommend this entry in the series.	2003-09-30

Certainly it's not a biography when you compare it with his incredible book about Charles Lindbergh.  But it does deal (in brief) with the life of Katharine Hepburn, one of the most remarkable women in show business - or anything else, for that matter.  And in that respect, there is no other way to categorize this book except as a biography.<br />In addition to his relationship with the lady, Berg does give a brief background of her life story, but that's really incidental when you read the whole book and realize that unlike &quot;Lindbergh&quot;, he does not stand apart from his subject - indeed, he celebrates his relationship with Hepburn.<br />I don't think I've ever read a book that worships its subject more - but considering who the book is about I don't mind at all.	2003-09-12

For example, &quot;Tailchaser's Song&quot; was a complete fantasy novel.  The &quot;Outland&quot; series was pure science fiction - highly imaginative s/f, to be sure, but still science fiction.<br />With &quot;The War of the Flowers&quot;, Williams blends fantasy, science fiction, and horror in one very weird (but good) read.  Theo Vilmos is a journeyman rock musician who can't seem to stay in one place for too long (musically speaking).  He's belonged to a few bands in his time, and aside from one minor success he hasn't done much with his life.  He's beginning to think it's time to grow up and join the real world - at least, what he thinks is the real world.  It seems that, in another place and time, someone else has quite different plans for our hero.<br />The main elements of &quot;Flowers&quot; are fantasy-driven - fairies, sprites, and pixies, among others.  But there are elements of horror as well, most notably the irrha, the creature that is sent after Theo - as well as the dragons, the Terrible Child, and the Remover of Inconvenient Obstacles, the creature who sends the irrha after Theo in the first place - a being who is at the same time more and less than he seems.<br />There are also distinct elements of science fiction in this novel.  I don't mean that you'll turn a page and come face to face with a flying saucer, or with a Buck Rogers ray gun.  No, what I mean by science fiction in this case is that Williams tries to establish a certain human logic to the way that Fairie (or New Erewhon, to use the other name Williams calls it) works.  And for the most part, he succeeds, although you'll have to think about the rules he sets for a while.<br />The beings in this story are all unique and fully thought-out characters in one way or another, but surprisingly the weakest one in the whole story is the main man himself - TheoVilmos.  Even in the most positive parts of the story he is simply too depressing.  But that's more than made up for by beings like Serge Cumber, the ferisher who majored in Mortal Studies in the Fairie equivalent of college; Poppy Thornapple, Theo's unlikely love interest; and particularly Button, the little goblin who's trying to make New Erewhon a better place; and Applecore, the sprite with a classic Irish temper and a heart to match.<br />The story that's told runs quite smoothly, but I really hope this isn't the last I hear of Theo, Poppy, and the others.  It seems to me that Williams has left the door open for additional stories about this world and its denizens - and I hope he'll follow through and write some.	2003-08-17

Reading this, her first book to be published in the US, it's easy to see why.<br />Douglass is not another Tolkien imitator, not by a longshot.  Oh yes, the basic formula is there - evil wants to rule the world, which has only one hope left.  But that's the formula of any fantasy novel, good or bad - and this is definitely one of the good ones.<br />Her characters are not quite as fleshed out as I would like them to be.  Douglass really needs to put more life into them.  But she makes up for that with the unanswered questions she poses throughout this book.  Who is Gorgrael's mentor, the Dark Man?  Who is the traitor in Axis' camp, as mentioned in the prophecy?  And how is it that members of the Charonites, the little-known fourth race in Douglass' world, became the Sentinels who will guide Axis, his beloved Faraday, and possibly others to their destinies?<br />Douglass' story is unique, in that it drops you into her world with a lot of these questions.

Unconventional because the heroine, Phedre no Delaunay, is everything you'd expect in a series of this kind - she's beautiful, smart, and intuitive.  And she also happens to be a courtesan, trained in both gathering intelligence and in the darker side of giving pleasure.  To put it bluntly, she's a high-priced S&amp;M call girl who's also something of a spy.<br />Rather an unusual combination and occupation, but Carey makes Phedre, her world and fellow travellers, and her story entirely believable.  She describes Phedre, her companion Joscelin, and all the other characters of her world in great detail without going overboard - and the story she has to tell is just as detailed and believable.<br />What makes this even more incredible is that despite the fact that this is a fantasy, Carey tells her story with a bare minimum of magic.  There are only two characters in the story who display any magical talent - Hyacinthe, Phedre's friend from childhood who's clairvoyant (what Carey's characters refer to as the dromonde); and the Master of the Straits - an 800-year-old victim of a mysterious curse who magically controls a vital waterway and whose permission must be obtained to cross it.<br />The history and geography Carey gives for her world is close to our own.  She gives her countries different names, and parallels the story of Jesus up to a point - but she then takes a left turn and provides her own mythology, which she makes frequent use of as background to her tale.<br />It took me two weeks to finish this book.  Part of the reason was that it's long - just over 900 pages.  But most of it is due to the excellent way Carey writes and tells Phedre's story.  I hope the other two volumes of this series are just as good.	2003-06-02

But he needs to take lessons on thriller writing from the late Robert Ludlum.<br />Although Ludlum's characters were larger than life his story and plotlines were always logical - you could pick up any of his books and trace out what happened and why. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" relies far too much on coincidence and inference, and when the villain's identity was actually revealed the story and its author lost a great deal of credibility. Even more credibility was lost in the climax and anti-climax that followed.<br />I can see how this book became so popular because of it's main subject (the mystery of the Holy Grail) and the obvious research that the author did on that subject. But as a thriller or mystery writer Brown falls far short of the mark.	2003-05-27

The writing style is completely different (although that may be due to the influence of his co-author, Andrew Gross), and compared to the Cross novels, extremely simplistic.  But that does not detract from the story being told, which is in its own way just as full of suspense as any of the Cross books.<br />The plot has already been described in other reviews, so I won't rehash it here.  I will say that despite its style the book is extremely well-written and the story is quite easy to follow.  There are no sudden revelations, except at the end.  But that revelation is somewhat far-fetched, even though hinted at throughout the book - and that, plus the simplistic writing style, and the fact that Patterson and Gross use modern idioms thoroughout the story, prevents me from giving \\"The Jester\\" a five-star rating.	2003-04-21

These stories are a worthy alternative to Anne Rice's tales of Lestat, Louis, Armand, and all the other denizens of her dark world.  The world of Saint-Germain is much lighter by comparison, and also contains far more action and intrigue than any of Rice's works (with the possible exception of \\"The Queen of the Damned\\").  This does not mean I dislike Rice's books.  Quite the contrary, in fact - but Yarbro paints a far less shadowy world than Rice does.<br />Here we meet one of the great loves of Saint-Germain's long life - Atta Olivia Clemens.  She has been horribly abused by her husband, a Senator of the Roman Empire around the time of Nero.  To call him a pervert is to make light of his atrocities; in addition he has political ambitions that are almost as sickening as his sexual ones.  It is this man, Cornelius Justus Silius, who is Saint-Germain's adversary in this novel, although the two of them do not actually do battle in any true sense of the word - and it is their actions against each other, and events related to those actions, which make up the core of this book.<br />Along the way Yarbro has much to teach us about vampire lore.  There is no mention of the use of a cross - but then again, this novel takes place at the time of Nero, and the Christians were just beginning to make themselves noticed at this time.  If Yarbro is correct, vampires are apparently more resilient than both Anne Rice and Bela Lugosi would have us believe.  They can live in sunlight, provided they are insulated in some manner by their native earth.  In the same manner, they can cross running water - something I did not know affected vampires until I read it here.  And they can create others of their kind, but not just in the way that Rice describes (I leave it to you to read this book to discover how).<br />At various points in this story there is also mention of Saint-Germain's past.  Some are just vague (but intriguing) hints; others are more explicit.  There is also some mention of his birthplace, and I would definitely like to know more about that particular part of the Comte de Saint-Germain.  He is such a fascinating individual that I will definitely be buying more of Yarbro's tales, to learn more about this worthy vampire and the worlds (plural intended) he lives in.	2003-04-15

As I started reading this book I thought this was nothing more than a Mitford wannabe. I was quickly disabused of that notion.<br />It does seem as though the basic idea is the same, but \\"Big Stone Gap\\" is nothing at all like Jan Karon's tales of Mitford NC. Trigiani's characters are more down-to-earth, more representative of small-town America. They don't have as many of the oddities that the natives of Mitford have.<br />Nevertheless there are some interesting characters in the town of Big Stone Gap. There's Iva Lou, the town librarian, who seems to go after anything in pants. There's Pearl Grimes, the newest employee of the town pharmacy and an apparent Cinderella in the making. And, of course, there's the main character of this book - Ave Maria Mulligan, the town pharmacist and self-appointed town spinster. It's her story we're reading here, and an interesting story it is.<br />The story really gets started when Ave Maria's mother dies and the town lawyer calls her into his office to show Ave Maria some documents entrusted to him, and (to use an old corny phrase) which were only to be opened in the event of her death. What is in those documents changes Ave Maria's life completely, and I won't spoil anything by saying what was in them.

First, though the main character is a woman, the author is a man - yet you completely believe that a woman is telling this story.<br />Second, Lott's writing style makes it seem as though \\"Jewel\\" was written in the 1950's - yet, according to the copyright page it was published in 1991.  The country was just starting to get into political correctness around that time, and it's hard to believe that a book that uses this sort of language (implied and explicit) could have been written in 1991.  But the fact remains that it was - and it's one of the best books I've read so far in 2003.<br />Yes, a good deal of the book is depressing - considering the major plotline it can't help but be depressing.  But while not every thread of the story is resolved, there's a lot more positive than negative feelings when you finish the last page.<br />I'm not exactly a fan of Oprah Winfrey's book club, but in \\"Jewel\\" she picked a winner.	2003-03-27

Patricia Cornwell covers the same territory as Kathy Reichs and her forensic anthropologist, Dr. Temperance (Tempe) Brennan.

Sad to say, Reichs doesn't seem to know when to quit.

I've seen the movie &quot;K-PAX&quot; and read the book the film was based on, and now I've read the sequel, &quot;On a Beam of Light&quot;.  And with all that, I'm still not sure who or what prot actually is.  That question only gets more confusing with this sequel about one of the most fascinating literary characters I've ever come across.<br />My review of &quot;K-PAX&quot; basically described it as a sort of 21st-century religious parable.  But having read &quot;Beam&quot; I'm not so sure anymore.  Prot's character still shows some religious undertones, but there are some definite science fiction-related mysteries that Brewer poses about him - and you can tell that he's having a lot of fun posing them.<br />For example, there are at least two instances I can recall in &quot;Beam&quot; where prot somehow crosses from one side of a room to the other in the space of less than a second.  To quote him, it's done with mirrors.  An old magician's saying, to be sure - but in prot's case I have to wonder.  Then there is the comparison of prot's blood workup with that of his &quot;host&quot; (?), Robert Porter.  That, plus some other incidents and statements throughout this book, will leave you shaking your head in amazement, wonder, and curiosity.  Just who or what is prot?<br />As in &quot;K-PAX&quot;, Brewer portrays himself as the psychiatrist who &quot;treats&quot; prot, and also as in &quot;K-PAX&quot; he maintains that prot is merely an alternate personality of Robert Porter.  But he's hard-pressed to retain that belief considering some of the things prot does, or causes to happen.<br />Brewer's descriptions of the other patients are fascinating on their own, as are most of the other characters in &quot;Beam&quot; - but prot is the main character here, as well as the catalyst for changes in most of the other people he encounters, both inside and outside the hospital.<br />There's supposed to be a third book about prot, and I look forward to reading it.  Perhaps Brewer will answer some of the mysteries he's posed about prot - but I seriously doubt it.	2003-03-11

The only differences I saw between the book and the movie are the name of the psychiatrist who &quot;treats&quot; prot, and the fact that this psychiatrist doesn't do hands-on work to find out prot's &quot;real&quot; name in the book as he does in the movie.<br />But these are nits in what is otherwise a wonderful novel.  And to make things even more interesting Brewer has written a sequel to &quot;K-PAX&quot; called &quot;On a Beam of Light&quot;.  I want to buy this book or borrow it from my local library and read more about prot - his world (his personal world, not K-PAX) and the earthlings who inhabit it.	2003-03-02

It was extremely well-written and thought out, but I didn't think that she could do it again.<br />Well, I'm happy to report that Fairstein has proved me wrong, in grand style.  \\"Likely to Die\\" is the second book in her series featuring Alex Cooper, the head of the sex crimes unit of the New York City District Attorney's office.  This entry in the series involves the rape and murder of a prominent doctor in a city hospital.  Or was there a rape?  As the investigation proceeds Cooper and her associate, New York City cop Mike Chapman, begin to wonder.  To say any more would spoil the plot.<br />As the real-life head of that same unit, Fairstein knows her stuff, and also knows the city backwards and forwards.  It's the little things that make this book so good - e.g., Alex wakes up to Don Imus and mentions Jim Ryan, the host of the morning news show on the local Fox station.  There are one or two misses - she apparently doesn't take the subway too often - but overall she's right on target with her description of life in the greatest city in the world.<br />She also makes Cooper, Chapman, and Chapman's partner Mercer Wallace seem so real you believe they actually exist - and she keeps up the \\"Final Jeopardy\\" gimmick of Cooper & Chapman betting on the answer for each night's Final Jeopardy question.  I'm still hoping that Cooper & Chapman become more than just friends and partners - the signs are all there - but I won't be unhappy if they don't.	2003-03-02

Well, that's not quite accurate, but it's a great teaser for people to read this review.<br />I read the first book in this series a few years ago and then just sort of put it aside.  After finishing this book I'm glad I came back to it.<br />The mystery angle is nothing special - you can buy quite a few books in the mystery section of any bookstore that are just as good.  It's Ms Kellerman's integration of religious Jewish life with the rest of the plot that will draw you in.<br />In the first novel in this series the life of the Jewish community was integral to the plot - indeed, without that integration there would have been no plot.  But you can't do the same thing for each entry in the series, and if this second entry is any indication, Ms Kellerman is going in the right direction.  Of necessity she started exploring Peter Decker's and Rina Lazarus' backgrounds in the first book.  Those backgrounds are not linked to the mystery in this novel, but they are even more fascinating than the details we learned about in the previous one.<br />Rabbi Schulman in particular is a great supporting character.  He is a very educated man, and not at all pompous about his education - he just wants to help his community and Decker along on the right path.<br />The conclusion of this aspect of the novel was somewhat surprising but it does open the door for some interesting possibilities in the next book.	2003-01-14

I've read excerpts of that execrable book and can't believe that the same man who wrote it is the same man who wrote this wonderful biography of Theodore Roosevelt.<br />Morris' research appears to be first-rate, and instead of voicing his own opinions on TR (whatever they may be) he allows his subject to speak for himself.  The fact that Morris has written this biography in a style that the average person can understand helps immensely.  He has not written just a bald recitation of facts; he has apparently been given access to Roosevelt's private journals, as well as similar documents from people who knew or worked with him.  The result is, for all intents and purposes, a look inside the mind of one of the greatest political and historical figures of the early twentieth century.<br />I was halfway through this book when I realized that I wanted to know more about TR as told by Morris.  Accordingly I went out and bought the next volume, \\"Theodore Rex\\".  Without even opening it I can feel sure that it will be just as good a book as this one.  But according to the blurbs and reviews on the back cover, that book only covers Roosevelt's presidency.  I hope that Morris is hard at work on a third volume covering TR's post-presidential years, and that it will come out soon.<br />There is only one thing wrong with this book, but it has nothing to do with its contents.  Apparently the folks at Modern Library (the paperback publishers) are skimping on quality.  As I read the book, the front cover on my copy started to tear at the spine, and I had to tape it to stop it from tearing any further.  Normally, once I finish a book I put it on Amazon's Marketplace so someone else can buy and enjoy it.  Not this time; I would be ashamed to send this to anyone.<br />Because of that I would say, do buy this book - but if at all possible get the hardcover edition.	2002-12-31

She began her integration in &quot;Merrick&quot;, and now continues it with &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot;, a worthy addition to her canon.<br />The main characters she's introduced in both series - Lestat in the first; and Rowan Mayfair and her husband Michael Curry in the second - are just incidental players here, but they figure importantly in the story being told.  That is the story of one Tarquin (Quinn) Blackwood, the young master of Blackwood Manor, an estate just outside of New Orleans.  Quinn's tale has three major points - how he met and became involved with the Mayfairs; how he became a vampire; and most importantly, his &quot;relationship&quot; with a spirit he calls Goblin, who is both less and more than just an ordinary ghost.  It is because of Goblin that Quinn meets the Mayfairs, and also why he seeks out Lestat.<br />Rice gives Quinn an intelligence and voice that is more than worthy of the tale he tells.  Lestat is, as always, a powerful presence, despite the comparatively minor role he plays here.  And many of the characters Rice introduces us to here are also extremely three-dimensional, incredibly - dare I use the word in describing an Anne Rice character? - human.<br />But there are some disappointments, which is why I can only give &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; four stars.  I couldn't help feeling that Rice was somehow suppressing Rowan and Michael - they should have had more to do, bigger roles to play.  The character of Petronia, the hermaphroditic vampire, seemed flat and one-dimensional - more of a joke than anything else.  And the character of Stirling Oliver, the only representative of the Talamasca in this book, didn't have much of a role at all - as little, in fact, as the entire Talamasca itself.  That was a disappointment - Rice has built up the mythology and character of the Talamasca throughout most of her novels, and to suddenly see them relegated to bit players comes as something of a shock.<br />With all of that, however, this book is definitely worth your time.	2002-11-15

Her characters don't display as many of those little quirks in their personalities and as much of that homespun philosophy that made me fall in love with the town in her first book (\\"At Home in Mitford\\").  And frankly, this entry in the series shows definite signs of belonging on the same shelf as your basic Harlequin romance.<br />But there was enough of the original charm from the first book to allow me to recommend this one.  The spiritual and emotional center of the town is still the local Episcopalian minister, Father Tim Kavanagh (whose last name we finally learn at the end of this book!).  His relationship with his next-door neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith, is still going down the same road as in the first book - although there are a lot of bumps and potholes along the way - and his bond with the boy Dooley is only getting stronger.<br />Aside from Father Tim's pursuit of Cynthia (and vice-versa), it would be impossible to describe all the little episodes that make up this book.  But there are some that stand out.  The town's latest widow, Edith Mallory, shows a definite mercenary streak - she's in shameless pursuit of Father Tim and also wants to close down the local diner and replace it with a dress shop that's willing to pay double the current rent.  Miss Sadie, the town millionaire, is literally pouring her millions into repairing her home, just so she can give her newfound niece the wedding of her (and Miss Sadie's) dreams.  And a redhead comes to Father Tim's door claiming to be his cousin Meg from Sligo, Ireland.<br />I do wish Ms. Karon had gone more deeply into the \\"Cousin Meg\\" sequence, but I can live with what she gave me.<br />Overall this is a worthy sequel to a fascinating tale of small-town life.	2002-11-03

It was about a man who wound up in the pages of Flaubert's &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; and romanced the title character.<br />The jacket doesn't say, but I have to assume that this was the catalyst for Jasper Fforde's new book, &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;.  The basic premise of the story is similar to &quot;Kugelmass&quot; - it is possible to cross over from the world of literature to the real world, and vice-versa.<br />But it takes more than a reference to one short story to make a good novel, and unfortunately it doesn't look like Fforde could find anything else.  His characters are completely one-dimensional (with the exception of his heroine), and the names he gives them - oy vay!  And it was very hard to follow along with some of them - they appeared to change locations and alliances without explanation (and in the case of alliances, at the drop of a hat).  Except for the heroine, Thursday Next, and the villain, I really couldn't figure out which side anyone was on.<br />Still, the basic premise is good, and I enjoyed that.  And who knows?  With a little more experience under his belt Fforde's next novel might be easier to follow.	2002-10-25

Each one of these people is a completely unique character - and boy, do I mean character.  There's Father Tim (his last name is Kavanagh, but you won't know that from this book - I only know it from reading the back cover of another book in the series), the rector of the local Episcopalian church.  He's the moral and spiritual center of Mitford, as well as one of its leading citizens.  He's also been \\"adopted\\" by a humongous dog which he names Barnabas.  How the dog (or should I say small horse?) meets up with Father Tim is just the starting point of this wonderful book.<br />There's a twelve-year-old boy named Dooley who captures Father Tim's heart, who looks and sounds like he just wandered in from the outskirts of Mayberry.<br />And then there's the good rector's new next-door neighbor, a gorgeous and intelligent dream named Cynthia, who captures his heart in quite a different way.  It's rather obvious what road this relationship will be going down, but the resolution won't be appearing in this book (apologies for the spoiler).<br />These are the three main characters in \\"At Home in Mitford\\", but there are dozens more that you will undoubtedly adopt into your own literary family.	2002-10-12

He's taken something that comes from the deepest recesses of his own mind - in this case something that looks like an old Buick (but knowing Stephen King it's anything but that) - and incorporated it into the daily lives of a novel's main characters.<br />In this case the main characters are the members of a Pennsylvania State Police barracks.  One day, years ago, one of the officers responds to a call about an abandoned car.  At least that's what it starts out as, but since we're dealing with a Stephen King novel we know from the get-go that it's not a car - and it probably wasn't abandoned either; rather, it was deliberately left at the gas station where it was &quot;found&quot;.<br />The &quot;car&quot; gets towed to the barracks and gets stored in a shed, where it quickly becomes apparent that it's more than just a car - but exactly what it is isn't really made clear; it looks like King wants to leave the reader with a little mystery in the story.<br />He then tries to integrate the &quot;Buick&quot; and its actions into the daily lives of these troopers.  They run various experiments in an attempt to discover exactly what this thing in their garage is.  They don't come up with any definitive answers, but along the way a lot of weird things happen - and I won't spoil anything for the reader by going into detail about them.<br />The troopers can't be sure what this thing is, but they'd rather keep it under lock and key in their shed than let it loose on an unsuspecting world (now there's a tired old cliche if ever I've heard one!), so that's exactly what they do.  And so over the next several years, in between the usual things that happen to state troopers, they keep the &quot;Buick&quot; confined to the shed and watch what it does with something more than a dispassionate eye.<br />All this doesn't mean that the book isn't as scary as King's best work.  It's plenty scary - and the fact that King doesn't resolve exactly what the &quot;Buick&quot; actually is makes it even scarier.<br />This is definitely a worthy addition to the canon.	2002-10-08

The novel basically follows Carrie on a journey of the self as she tries to come to terms with what's happened to Mike (her fiance), and to her friends, family, and most of all to herself as a result of that fateful dive.<br />Packer's Carrie is a fully realized character who I empathized with and believed in for the entire novel.  She paints her people with broad strokes of the brush but nevertheless succeeds in bringing them to fully realized life.  Very few novels I've read in recent months have done that.<br />The most impressive character in this story to my mind is Kilroy.  Immediately upon meeting him I had a strong impression of what he should look, think, and feel like.  He is, in my view, a character tailor-made for George Carlin to play if they ever turn this book into a movie.  His philosophy and Carlin's outlook on life seem to fit together like a hand into a glove.<br />If this first novel is any indication Packer has a glorious career ahead of her.	2002-09-26

This is probably one of the stranger ones.<br />According to &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot;, one of the major contributors to the OED, with over 10,000 entries to his credit, was a certifiable madman, locked up in an insane asylum just outside of London.  What is even more incredible is that the people who put the first edition of the OED together were unaware of this for close to twenty years.<br />Simon Winchester has put together a small gem of historical fact in the story of Dr. William Chester Minor, an American in England just after the Civil War, who killed a man for no apparent reason (at least, no reason any sane individual would understand) and was therefore confined to the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum for most of the rest of his life.<br />How Minor came to be a major contributor to the OED is a story that must be read to be believed.  Winchester has put together a compulsively readable account of both Minor and the history of the OED.

I've gone back to those writings of hers that I love - those featuring Commander Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard, the only policeman I can think of who can truly fit the description of a modern-day Rennaissance man.<br />This time around Dalgliesh and his squad tackle the case of a barrister who is murdered in her chambers.  There are apparently plenty of people who wanted to see Venetia Aldridge dead, both within and without her profession and offices.  It is Dalgliesh's job, of course, to sort out all the motives, alibis, etc. and determine who it was that killed the woman.<br />Along the way we learn quite a bit about the victim, her family and family life, and the people who enter her orbit in her profession, including a man who turns out to be one of the most evil people I have encountered in my recent readings.  All of the people in this novel are described - physically, mentally, and emotionally - down to the minutest detail.  I could actually picture them in my head, although to me Dalgliesh will always resemble Roy Marsden, the actor who has portrayed him in several TV adaptations of James' novels.<br />From a policeman's or investigator's point of view the ending of this novel would, I suppose, be very unsatisfying.  From this reader's point of view, though the ending wasn't what I hoped it would be, it proved to be something of an anticlimax, and fit in well with the rest of the plot.<br />The nice thing about the Dalgliesh series is that James writes her stories and describes her characters and situations with such detail that, had they been written by anyone else, would have invited extremely harsh words from the vast majority of the critical world, which would probably have included some phrases along the lines of, \\"who told you that you could write?\\"<br />But Lady James has such a wonderful command of theEnglish language that this incredible attention to detail only serves to whet our appetite as we continue to read.  And she's only gotten better with each novel.  The bio for this book doesn't say, but I have to wonder whether she ever taught English or a related subject in a previous life.<br />I'm reading the series out of order, but I would like to pick up other Dalgliesh novels.  The hints that James dropped concerning Dalgliesh's erstwhile partner, Inspector Kate Miskin, were too intriguing to ignore.  I hope she wrote about Miskin's \\"troubles\\" in an earlier book.	2002-09-08

But having read this excellent story of his life (somehow, the term autobiography doesn't apply), I will definitely go to the Times' website and search for his stories in the archives.<br />Bragg speaks very lovingly, but not overly cloyingly, of the region in Alabama where he grew up.  He tells us about his mother - sorry, make that momma - and how she raised him and his two brothers.  He relates the good and the bad, both about his family and friends, and some of the assignments he covered during his career as a reporter - most notably Haiti after Aristede's exile and before his return, and the riots in Miami.<br />But in the end, as I hopefully implied in the title of my review, this is really the story of how Bragg's upbringing molded him into the person he is today.

This is a completely unique fantasy novel and the funniest thing I've read in years.  The plot is your basic tried and true fantasy story, something I'm sure you've read a hundred times before - but never with a leading man like this.  Apropos is a greedy coward who always looks out for his own interests ahead of everyone else's.  The problem is that, just like Flashman, an awful lot of people mistake his selfishness for nobility - and if it'll advance his causes he doesn't do anything to change their minds about it.  Apropos isn't as over the top as Sir Harry, but he's a definite first cousin to that noted rascal.    If you've read any of the Flashman stories you already know the basic plot, even allowing for the insertion of elements of fantasy into the story.

The only two things that were taken from Ludlum's book were that the protagonist is an amnesiac who apparently is a living lethal weapon, with all sorts of people trying to kill him; and that the name of the woman he kidnaps and who eventually falls in love with him is named Marie.<br />Beyond that, the plot of the movie is nothing like the plot of the book.<br />I had gotten bored with Ludlum over the last few years, because most of his stories followed the same basic formula - innocent foil uncovers global conspiracy, which then sets out to silence him. Along the way, he picks up an incredibly gorgeous woman; they fall in love and reveal the conspiracy to an astonished world, which rewards him with the life he's always wanted. The guy is always incredibly good-looking, and the woman could pass for Pamela Anderson Lee's twin sister. And both happen to have the exact skills and knowledge required to foil the conspiracy.<br />Maybe the reason I liked \\"The Bourne Identity\\" so much is because I hadn't read any of Ludlum's books in several years, and I'd forgotten how he writes his stories. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that I did like it. Despite the formulaic writing, the story's sequencing is seamless - you don't turn a page and suddenly come on a plot twist straight out of left field. Ludlum also doesn't bother with the hokey secret agent mumbo-jumbo you see in some other spy/action novels.<br />But he doesn't do a good job at all of getting his main characters to talk about their feelings for each other. When it comes to love talk, Ludlum's writing isn't any better than what you'll find in your average Harlequin romance.<br />With all that, though, I'm glad I picked up this book. I even went out and bought the next book in the \\"Bourne\\" sequence - but I think I'll wait a few years to read it.	2002-07-09

Well, primarily it's because Moon writes in a more modern style than Tolkien, which makes her infinitely more readable than he ever was.<br />Don't get the wrong idea - in fantasy, Tolkien is still the standard by which all others are judged. I've read \\"The Hobbit\\" and LOTR four times over the last ten years. But I've always had trouble reading it because of Tolkien's flowery and somewhat antiquated writing style.<br />\\"The Deed of Paksenarrion\\", on the other hand, is written in a contemporary mode, in more ways than one. It is also a more active story than LOTR, and there is less emphasis on magic - although elves and other magical creatures do play a major part in the story.<br />I understand that there is a prequel to this book, dealing with the history of Gird, the warrior saint mentioned throughout \\"Deed\\". I plan to buy this book as soon as possible; if it's written even half as well as \\"Deed\\" I should be in for a treat.	2002-06-24

So perhaps he can be forgiven for being somewhat cynical - but some of what he talks about in \\"Napalm & Silly Putty\\" sounds like the rantings of a potential anarchist (or worse).  Dennis Miller was never this angry.<br />My reaction to this book is somewhat surprising, because I've seen and heard Carlin do his thing on several albums and HBO specials and laughed myself silly.  But I do have to admit that his more recent efforts have had a tinge to them that I'm not sure I like - and this book only confirms that suspicion.<br />Admittedly this book was written well before the events of September 11, so Carlin can be forgiven for some of the things he writes about.  But even so, he left me with my jaw dropping at times.  For example, his routine about \\"Airport Security\\".  Pre-9/11, it might have drawn a few chuckles.  Post-9/11, it is completely sickening and not worthy of the man who told us about the \\"Seven Dirty Words You Can't Say on Television\\".  His \\"Interview With Jesus\\", even pre-9/11, is totally unfunny, and I rapidly turned the pages to find his next topic.<br />There are some real gems in here, though.  For example, \\"It's Not a Sport\\".  This might be taken completely from his stand-up routine, but even on paper it's still incredibly funny.  I wish he'd accompanied it with his comparison of football and baseball, but that's OK - this will do.  The same goes for \\"Icebox Man\\".<br />And some of his \\"Short Takes\\" had me rolling on the floor.  A lot of them are too dirty or too sick (funny/sick) to publish here, but my absolute favorite is: \\"One of my favorite things to do at a party is smoke a bunch of PCP and start taking people's rectal temperatures without permission\\".  Believe me, that's mild compared with some of the other stuff in this book.  Some of the other \\"Short Takes\\" aren't as funny, but they're dead-on.<br />All told, if you can't stand George Carlin,avoid this book.  If you like George Carlin, go ahead and buy it - but be warned that it's a very mixed bag, and that there's a lot of anger in that bag.	2002-05-17

The last book of his that I read, &quot;Night Over Water&quot;, had cartoon characters as its principal actors and a plot straight out of an old WWII movie - although I had to admit he did his research.<br />The problem is magnified here, with &quot;Code to Zero&quot;.  Again, Follett has done his research, there's no denying that - but this novel is just about as bad as &quot;Night Over Water&quot;.  The story starts out very well, and held my interest for quite a while.  A man wakes up in a corner of Union Station in 1950's Washington DC, with no knowledge of how he got there - or of anything else before that moment.  He's dressed like a bum, but his thoughts, instincts, and actions contradict that first impression.  He sets out to discover who he is and how he got to Union Station, and therein lies Follett's tale.<br />But the initial interest I had in the story soon disintegrated when I discovered that &quot;Code&quot; was really nothing more than a potboiler spy story, something I thought Follett was incapable of writing until now.  Basically this turned out to be a story of the heroic United States against the godless Communists, and while this does have some kind of weird but logical resonance after the events of September 11, this type of story has been done before - and much better (Arnaud DeBorchgrave's &quot;The Spike&quot; springs immediately to mind).<br />Follett has a new novel out in hardcover, and I'll reserve it at my local library.  I'm willing to give him another chance - but my patience is wearing thin.	2002-05-01

But where most efforts at this combination have fallen flat on their collective face, Hamilton's first novel shows a great deal of promise.<br />Don't get me wrong here - the writing and the plot are very simplistic and Hamilton uses a lot of standard mystery and horror plot devices.  But there's something about this first in the &quot;Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter&quot; series that just takes you up and pulls you in.<br />If the rest of the series is like this first book then I have a lot more &quot;guilty pleasures&quot; to read through.	2002-04-17

Some - in fact, most - of these stories are quite good, and several (\\"The Man in the Black Suit\\", \\"The Road Virus Heads North\\", and \\"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What it is in French\\", to name a few) quite literally sent a chill down my spine.  Most of the other horror tales aren't quite in the same league as those but are still 100% better than most of what's currently in the horror section of bookstores now.<br />There's also an introductory essay about these stories, as well as a printed version of the only successful e-novel so far (\\"Riding the Bullet\\", which scared me plenty when I first downloaded it) and a printed version of one of the stories in King's audio compilation (\\"Blood and Smoke\\"), which as read by the author put me to sleep.  I'm glad he put it to paper; it's a much better story this way despite what King says in his introduction to the story.  King can write good stories but he certainly can't narrate them.  I hope he puts the other stories in that \\"book\\" to paper so I can enjoy them.<br />There is also a prequel of sorts to the \\"Dark Tower\\" series.  I personally have found the \\"Dark Tower\\" books to be totally incomprehensible, and the fact that King made mention of the Tower in \\"Black House\\" didn't exactly endear that book to me when I read it.  But \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" was actually quite a good novella, and I may just go and buy the first few volumes of the series again to see if it's a little more understandable.<br />There is one clunker in this collection, and it's thelast story - \\"Luckey Quarter\\".  The fact that \\"Lucky\\" is spelled incorrectly should have been a dead giveaway (no pun intended).<br />This collection will have to serve until King's next novel, which I believe will be coming out towards the end of this year.  Can't wait!	2002-04-14

She stops with George Bush, probably because she wasn't in the Washington press corps anymore when Bill Clinton moved into the White House.<br />Combined with Ms Stahl's description of Washington's inner circles over the years is a somewhat detached description of her years with CBS News and with her family. Her personal story is not badly written, but I didn't really get a sense of her feelings toward her parents or her daughter, although her love for her husband comes shining through. On the other hand, her various friendships, battles, and other interactions with Dan Rather, Bill Plante, and others in front of and behind the camera at CBS News are very well done; I got a good sense of what these people are actually like - more than what I see of them when I watch the news.<br />It's truly a shame that Ms Stahl's description of her family life isn't as natural as the rest of her book. I had the pleasure of meeting her a few times when I was working behind the counter of the now-defunct Crown Books store a block away from the White House. I found her to be a warm, friendly person who spoke very naturally and lovingly about her daughter and other personal (but not TOO personal) topics - quite at odds with the impression I got reading her descriptions of them in her book.<br />Even with all that I've mentioned here, I would still recommend it.	2002-03-23

I don't have too many of them on my shelves, and usually they don't catch my eye when I go to the local Barnes & Noble.  But for some reason, A. Scott Berg's biography of Charles Lindbergh jumped out at me when I saw it a few months ago.  Maybe it was the little blurb on the cover that this book had won the Pulitzer.  Maybe it was the additional blurb that this was a New York Times bestseller.  I don't know what it was, but I bought the book.<br />Turns out it was the best thing I ever did.<br />Of course I knew about the main points of Lindbergh's life - the first man to fly from New York to Paris, and the awful episode of \\"the Lindbergh baby\\" kidnapping and murder.  I also had some knowledge of Lindbergh's later reputation - he was seen by some as a Nazi sympathizer, or worse.<br />Berg gives the facts behind these points, and also behind the rest of Lindbergh's life.  He does so with an incredible style and in great detail - but not so much detail as to bog down the reader and prevent him or her from finding out about the fascinating man that Charles Lindbergh was.  And he was fascinating - there's no other word for it.<br />The only other phrase that comes to mind to describe Lindbergh is \\"a mass of contradictions\\".  Berg describes all of those contradictions without detracting from his life in any way.  The most important contradiction(s) in this story is Lindbergh's feelings toward his wife.<br />I could go on and on about this book and the way Berg wrote it.  The best recommendation I can give you is that I urge you to pick it up and read it yourself.	2002-03-12

Trouble is, the book reads like it	Now, how do I explain that title?  I know - it's kind of confusing.  Well, here goes.<br />The story of Robert Hanssen is fairly well-known by now, in generalities.  Most of the world doesn't know the specifics, and that's what David Vise attempts to do here.<br />Vise does tell as much of the story as he could get his hands on.  He lays it out in chronological order, looking at both sides of the story - Hanssen's and the man who headed up his capture, FBI Director Louis Freeh.<br />The thing is, the story reads like a newspaper article - or, more accurately, I felt like I was reading a plot from &quot;Dragnet&quot; (remember?  &quot;Just the facts, ma'am.&quot;).  Being a true story, I realize that Vise can't embellish on what happened, but his writing style is extremely low-key - almost dead, which is somewhat surprising, since I read this book based on Terry Gross' interview with him on National Public Radio's &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, in which he was extremely animated and passionate about his subject.<br />I now know as much as anyone else about the Hanssen affair - but I didn't really enjoy finding out what I learned.	2002-03-06

That said, this is still a better thriller than 95% of the novels in the genre - the rating is based solely on that comparison.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, Follett gives the reader an excellent course in the design, interior, and the &quot;feel&quot; of the Pan Am Clipper; I didn't know anything about this aircraft before I read the book, and Follett's lessons are designed so that any layman can understand them.<br />But while the plot of this story is well-designed and totally logical, the people come off as cartoon characters.  None of them are fully developed human beings in any sense of the word.  And the conclusion is curiously incomplete - something unusual in a Ken Follett novel.<br />As an introduction to Follett's work this would turn anyone off of his other, much better, works - &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot; and &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, to name two.  I would recommend this book only if you've read some of his other novels, so you can judge for yourself what he's really capable of writing.	2002-02-18

But when it was time to pick a new book to read from my library, I saw it sitting there - and in light of the events of September 11, it somehow seemed that this was the perfect time to read this book, and that this was the perfect book for the time.<br />For this book, Terkel interviewed men and women from all walks of life, and from both sides of the war, in order to paint as complete a picture of that time as possible.  He has more than succeeded.  Some of his interviewees were for the war; a few were against it, even when they were in the thick of it.  Some told of the injustices done to Japanese-Americans, and some told of what they found when they arrived at the gates of Buchenwald.<br />Each man and woman has their own story to tell, and Terkel lets them tell it in their own voice.  The grammar, syntax, etc. varies from person to person, told exactly as Terkel recorded it.  There are some accounts from famous people (John Kenneth Galbraith, Mike Royko, and Maxine Andrews, to name a few), but most of the stories are told by the so-called common people.  And even those people whose names are known outside of this book don't put on any airs when they allow Terkel to record them.<br />That single fact makes this the best book on or about any war that I've ever read - beyond even such admitted classics as &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, &quot;The 13th Valley&quot;, and &quot;Battle Cry&quot;.  Those books, and many others like them, are very good - but the people in them are all larger than life.  You don't get that impression reading these accounts.<br />Kudos to Studs Terkel for preserving these stories and letting us see the real face of World War II.	2002-01-25

From Light Bulbs to Lasers: The Fascinating Stories Behind the Great Inventions That Have Changed Our Lives	Books	4	7	10	N	N	A science book for the average Joe	I've been a fan of Ira Flatow's for many years.  I first heard him doing stories on NPR's &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, reporting on any news of the day that had even a hint of science in it.  I lost track of him for a few years when he became the science correspondent for &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; - that program was on in the middle of my work day and I couldn't listen to it.  But I did manage to catch his stint on PBS's &quot;Newton's Apple&quot;, and my only complaint was that the show didn't last longer.<br />It's a real pleasure to discover that Flatow has written a book that is just as easy for the average person to understand as his reports on NPR and his demonstrations on &quot;Newton's Apple&quot;.  &quot;They All Laughed&quot; tells the stories behind several inventions that we all take for granted.  And you can figure out the theme of each of these stories by the title of the book - when each of these items, gadgets, etc. first came out, the general reaction was basically, &quot;WHY?&quot;<br />Along the way, Flatow gives us some information that we might not be aware of.  I for one did not know that the story of Ben Franklin and the kite was just that - a story.  It's true that Franklin flew the kite, but it's not true that the kite was struck by lightning.<br />My personal favorite among all of Flatow's stories is the one about the invention of Silly Putty.  I remember playing with the stuff as a kid and marveling that I could press it onto a comic strip, lift it up, and VOILA!  A reverse image of the comic.  I never asked who invented Silly Putty, but now I wish I had.<br />If there is an audio version of this book I hope it's Flatow who's doing the narration.  I'd buy it in a New York minute.	2002-01-10

She moved away from the Big Apple, joined the National Park Service, and became one of their rangers.  Assigned to Guadalupe Mountains National Park in west Texas, however, she finds that she hasn't escaped violence after all - she finds the body of a fellow ranger out in the deepest reaches of the park.  At first it appears that she was the victim of a cougar attack, but Anna slowly discovers that there are too many things that just don't fit with that assumption.<br />Anna is an extremely well developed, fleshed-out character, as are the other people in this mystery.  And Barr's descriptions of the park and the surrounding area are absolutely beautiful.  In some cases she describes the local flora and fauna down to the minutest detail.<br />The plotline and logic of the story is also well developed and well thought out.  There is not a single misstep.<br />But - and this is an extremely big BUT - Barr does not follow through on the resolution of her story.  She allows Anna to deal with the actual murderer, but though there is an implication of what will happen if she tries to follow through and take care of the murderer's accomplices, Barr doesn't allow Anna to at least make the attempt.  I would have given this book four, or maybe even five, stars if she had let Anna try.  Even if she had failed as predicted, at least there would have been more of a sense of closure.  Instead I was left hanging.<br />As Barr continues this series, I hope that she corrects this flaw in her stories, and I hope that Piedmont (Anna's cat) and Molly (Anna's psychologist sister) are not the only characters that follow Anna from book to book.  In particular I hope to see more of Christina Walters and her daughter Alison.  They were as human and asfleshed-out as Anna and I'd like to see her friendship with them develop and continue.	2001-12-24

You cannot use the term &quot;potboiler&quot; with a Le Carre book, although some of his more recent endeavors have come dangerously close to that level.  Thankfully, &quot;Single &amp; Single&quot; is not one of them.<br />Since the KGB doesn't exist anymore, Le Carre must look elsewhere for the kind of story he writes like nobody else.  And he's found it in the story of Oliver Single, the son and junior partner of a banking house whose owner and senior partner is a greedy, corrupt, and probably amoral (business)man who has gotten in way over his head by getting involved in the drug trade with some - shall we say, less than reputable - gentlemen from the former Soviet Union.<br />As with most Le Carre novels, the story moves back, forth, and sideways between various parts of and characters within the same story.  You have to flip back a few times to keep track of who's who and what's what, but that was part of the charm of the George Smiley/Karla series, and it's the same here.<br />Unfortunately this book does suffer from the one flaw that exists in most of Le Carre's books - and that's an uncanny ability to turn its so-called action sequences into the dullest parts of the story.  I actually enjoyed the back-and-forth between the characters more than I enjoyed what they did.  But if this &quot;flaw&quot; were corrected, I think I'd actually like Le Carre less than I do.  Weird, isn't it?	2001-12-09

I never thought I'd see or hear of anything like that movie again, but thankfully I was wrong.<br />&quot;Carry Me Home&quot; is &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; in print.  Don't infer any hidden meaning from that sentence; the plots of the two are as different as night and day.  But they both deal with the same subject - the aftermath of the Vietnam war, what that means to several men (and women) in small-town America, and how each of them deals with it.<br />The two main characters in this book are Robert Wapinski and Anthony Pisano, of Mill Creek Falls, PA.  In such an environment it seems incredible that these two men apparently never met before the events in this novel, but that's what Del Vecchio seems to imply.  And it really doesn't matter whether they did or not, because their lives become more and more intertwined as the story unfolds.<br />Their lives take radically different turns.  Robert becomes moderately successful as a real estate broker and then as a pioneer in the solar and ecology field.  Tony, on the other hand, drops out of society - he just can't handle what people think about him as a Vietnam vet (and more importantly, he can't handle what he thinks about himself as a Vietnam vet).  That statement, including the parenthetical comment, may not make any sense unless you know something of the history of US involvement in Vietnam (e.g., Lt William Calley and the My Lai massacre).  But Tony does try for a little while - he courts and marries a girl and has two children, but the pressure just becomes too much for him.  And even though Robert seems able to integrate himself back into society, he too is haunted by what happened and what he did in Vietnam.<br />What these two men do to heal themselves and other vets forms the crux of this story, and Del Vecchio never falters in the telling of it until the very end.  At that point he seems to deal too much in psychology and not in the people themselves.  But until then this is a fantastic story of a subject that not too many novels deal with.  The Chicago Sun-Times said of Del Vecchio's &quot;The 13th Valley&quot;, &quot;...quite simply, THE novel about the Vietnam war.&quot;  Well, quite simply, &quot;Carry Me Home&quot; is THE novel about that war's aftermath.	2001-12-02

If you simply don't understand the British or British humor, your face will screw up into a question mark, you'll go &quot;HUH?&quot;, and wonder why the heck you bought it in the first place.<br />Obviously, I am in the former camp.  I always suspected that if you take away the Royal Family's wealth, prestige, and titles, they'd just be another bunch of lovable British eccentrics (well, lovable to most of us, anyway...).  Townsend has proved that's the case with this gentle, wonderful satire.  Each of the Royals tries to cope with life among the common people in his or her own way, and the results range from mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud funny - Prince Charles wearing a ponytail and serving time in jail, Princess Anne taking up with a plumber, and the Queen's dog joining (and eventually leading) a pack of street dogs.<br />One other note.  In addition to reading the book, I also listened to the audiobook version of this novel several years ago.  The book is good, but I highly recommend the tape.  There's something about the narrator's imitation of the various Royals that made the story even funnier than it was on the printed page.	2001-10-26

This book doesn't even do that; all it has to offer is page after page of small talk - and if you go to lots of parties or other social gatherings you know how boring that gets.<br />Which is really a pity, because the first two books in Fancher's series were quite intriguing.  But in this, the third book, the bottom just drops out of the story.  In fact, there is no story.<br />There's supposed to be a fourth book, and I might buy that to see if Fancher can come back from this debacle.	2001-10-23

I suppose every city or town has its share of eccentrics, but to judge by &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, Savannah GA is composed of nothing but eccentrics.  And John Berendt describes each and every one of them in beautiful detail.<br />I chuckled over the story of William Simon Glover, the elderly gentleman who continues to walk a dog named Patrick for his owner, even though the dog (and, perhaps, the owner?) has been dead for twenty years.  I shook my head in wonder at the story of Luther Driggs, who claims to have a container of poison &quot;five hundred times more lethal than arsenic&quot;.  And I'm still trying to get a handle on Chablis - by Berendt's account, the world's most gorgeous drag queen - as sassy and sexy as anyone born a woman could possibly be.<br />The second half of the book is more somber in tone, dealing as it does with a murder trial that goes into quadruple overtime.  The people Berendt describes in conjunction with the trial are somewhat more down to earth, but just as eccentric in their own ways as the other people he writes about.<br />It's truly a pity that Berendt left Savannah.  I really wanted to get more acquainted with his friends - but then again, I don't think he could have written much more about them without starting to repeat himself, or without starting to bore some readers.<br />The rating of four stars is because of the more somber mood of the murder trial.  This is a truly wonderful book.	2001-10-11

First, it's prequel (&quot;The Talisman&quot;) was distinctly written in Stephen King's style - if Peter Straub did indeed collaborate with King on that book you'd never know it.<br />With &quot;Black House&quot;, it's noticeably more of a combined effort.  The writing is more Straub's style than King's, but the mythology is definitely King.  There are references to &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; as well as &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, King's self-styled magnum opus and the most incomprehensible work of fantasy fiction since the Gormenghast trilogy.  There are also attempts throughout the story to make it read like some kind of dark fairy tale, or a more morbid version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.  Those factors make this an incredibly depressing novel, even though the ending is a positive one.<br />But despite the definite dark tone of this book I still held on to the end.  The writing is top-drawer, more surprising when you realize that Straub's been turning out clunker after clunker over the last few years.<br />I'm recommending this book, but with the caveat that you be aware that it's hardly a fun read, as most of King's novels are.  I wish he'd either explain or junk the whole idea of the Dark Tower.  At the rate he's going with it we'll all be long gone before he finally explains what it's all about.	2001-10-05

Bernie is a professional burglar who seems to get into more trouble than a cat at a dog show, if this series is to be believed. But if this book is any indication, the series is well worth your time.<BR><BR>Yes, the characters (except for Bernie) are pretty much from the list of typical &quot;B-movie&quot; roles, some of the clues are so obvious you could just cry, and the solution to the murder is really straight out of left field - but surprisingly, it doesn't really matter.

Was this the way things really happened?  Did Merlyn (using Whyte's spelling) and Uther actually exist, and really live their lives as Whyte describes?  We'll probably never know for sure, but Whyte certainly made me believe they could have.  All of his characters are three-dimensional, flesh-and-blood people - and though I know how the story had to turn out (this is, after all, the story of Arthur), there were quite a few moments in this volume that took my breath away.  At some points I honestly believed that Whyte was going to play some kind of dirty trick on me and veer off into an alternate universe.<br />Along the way Whyte gives us several lessons in history and the religion of the time.  I'm not enough of a scholar to know whether or not a debate such as the one he describes actually took place, but I certainly believed in his description of it.  And he presents both sides of several religious arguments in a way such that any layman could understand them, without his (Whyte's) obviously taking one side or the other.<br />My only complaint with this particular entry in the series is that Whyte doesn't really dig into the life, history, or personality of Lot of Cornwall.  What little description he does give makes Lot out to be evil personified, but I really would have liked to learn more about what made this man tick.<br />Unlike the first two, there is a little bit of &quot;magic&quot; in this volume, if you can call dreams magic.  It seems that Whyte's Merlyn has a bit of precognition - his dreams accurately predict several events in the story.  But there is no overt magic - nobody turns into a newt or anything else.<br />I'm eagerly looking forward to volume four.	2001-08-23

These stories may just work on the printed page, or perhaps with somebody else reading them - but certainly not Stephen King.  His voice just drones, on and on, ad infinitum (almost ad nauseam) in a monotone that only slightly varies when his characters get a tad emotional.<br />It really pains me to have to say this, because I've loved everything King has ever written (except the Dark Tower series, which makes absolutely no sense at all) - but he's a much better writer than a reader.  Note that I say &quot;reader&quot;, not &quot;speaker&quot;.  I've heard him speak, both off the cuff and in a lecture, and he's much more emotional and emphatic in those modes.  Please, Stephen, put these stories out in a book, or get someone else to read them.  The blurb on the case that says &quot;read by the author&quot; is a nice gimmick, but that's all it is - a gimmick.	2001-08-07

There are other books or groups of books that have attempted this, most notably Mary Stewart's Merlin Chronicles - but Stewart never painted her picture with as big a brush as Jack Whyte does, and (so far at least) Whyte has done it without a hint of magic or any other type of fantasy.<br />This is not intended as a slap at Stewart; I think her series is fantastic.  It's just that I never thought it was possible to tell the story of Arthur and Merlin from a &quot;human&quot; point of view, until now.  Whyte has proved that it's possible.  So far I've only read the first two books in the series (&quot;The Skystone&quot; and this one), and if the rest of Whyte's novels are as superbly intelligent and well-written as these two I believe that Mary Stewart has some serious competition on her hands.	2001-08-07

Dunwoody.  It seems to me that most of the people of that time were more closed (emotionally speaking) and priggish than we are today, but according to Larson, these people carried these traits to an unheard-of extreme.  They were egotistical braggarts who were convinced of their own superiority and refused to accept that they could possibly be wrong about anything - and they certainly were wrong about the hurricane that hit Galveston in September 1900.<br />By today's standards one would have to wonder why these bureaucrats didn't get their walking papers immediately once the full extent of the hurricane's damage became known.  I can only assume that the mores of the time were quite a bit different than they are today.<br />I will also say that I felt sorry for Isaac and Joseph.  The few days surrounding the hurricane were probably the only days these two brothers shared any &quot;family time&quot; together as adults.  As Larson makes clear they really never spoke to each other after that, or even acknowledged each other's existence - but he isn't exactly clear on what caused this rift.  I would have liked to learn more about that particular piece of Isaac's history.	2001-07-27
US	53067436	R3OCB77ZX62SMV	1551665735	870830835	A Perfect Evil	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A mix of Cornwell and Patterson, each on an off day	This book and the characters in it bear striking resemblances to Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta and James Patterson's Alex Cross.  There are also reminders of, among others, FBI agent Dana Scully of &quot;X-Files&quot; fame (without the supernatural/alien aspects of her work).<br />I get the feeling that Ms. Kava (note to the Library Journal reviewer - Alex Kava is a WOMAN, buddy!) studied these and other authors and decided to use them as a template for her own first novel.  Problem is, she's nowhere near as good as either of them.  The upshot and result is that this is a book that reads like a bad version of Cornwell or Patterson.  For either of those two authors this would be OK, since even on an off day they can write rings around most of the current crop of mystery writers.  But Kava is no Cornwell or Patterson, and it really shows.<br />A previous reviewer has mentioned that s/he thinks Kava hates men, based on the way Kava writes her male characters.  I wouldn't go that far, but it does seem to me that her female characters are stronger than her male ones.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but there isn't a single strong male character in this novel.  Sheriff Nick Morrelli appears to be strong to the rest of his community, but it's obvious he's putting on a front.  His father, the previous sheriff, would be right at home in a B western movie.  We don't get a peek into his soul the way we do at Nick's.  Even the killer is, ultimately, a weak man.<br />Kava's females, on the other hand, are very strong women.  FBI agent Maggie O'Dell is a superwoman, as is Christine Hamilton, the newspaper reporter.  Even when her son becomes a possible victim of the killer, she keeps on going - she doesn't take the time to cry over his possible fate.<br />Kava needs to add some weaknesses to her women and strengths to her men.  She also needs to find her own voice; hopefully she'll do that with the promised sequel to this book.	2001-07-08

His description of the equally mysterious goings-on in the Wells' cellar is just as fascinating.  And you eventually realize that these two stories must be connected in some way, although you have no idea how.<br />But the climax and the connection, when it's finally revealed, is completely idiotic, and straight out of a 1950's s/f pulp magazine.  I was expecting a much better resolution than this, and I turned the pages expecting to discover that this was nothing more than an ant dream, and the true climax was about to be revealed.  But no - this was it.<br />The book reads almost as if Werber had gotten tired of writing it, and wanted to finish it quickly.  Well, he certainly did that - but at the expense of what could have been a truly incredible piece of fiction.	2001-07-06

I've had this book on my shelves for almost fifteen years, if you can believe it, but never got around to reading it until this week.  Now I can't figure out why it took me so long to open it.<br />&quot;Cal&quot; describes the &quot;troubles&quot; in Northern Ireland in a simple yet elegant manner, with a bare minimum of explicit violence and gore.  Most of the violence is implied - the two exceptions being the story of how Marcella Morton became a widow, and what at first glance seems to be a rather pointless episode concerning a land mine and a cow.  It seemed pointless, that is, until you read further and discovered exactly how the land mine came to be there.<br />While the violence is at a minimum, the thoughts, feelings, and philosophies of each side are explored quite thoroughly for such a small book.  And while I personally found both points of view quite repellent, I will say that I believed that the characters in this book had these beliefs, and that they were extremely passionate regarding them.<br />The book is also an interesting psychological study, at least as far as Cal McCluskey (the main character) is concerned.  With the help of Marcella, the woman he comes to love, it seems that he is growing up, and coming to realize that there's a lot more out in the world than just Catholics &amp; Protestants fighting and killing each other - but his past will ultimately work against him and nullify all the good that Marcella has done for him - because he was the driver of the car containing the man that killed her husband.<br />A touching, sad, and very important book.	2001-06-29

To me, more than anything else it's the coming of age of one John Grady Cole. A few years after WWII Cole decides to ride down from his Texas home to Mexico along with his friend Lacey Rawlins. Cole is a cowboy at heart, but circumstances have deprived him of his intended livelihood. His grandfather, the owner of a large ranch, has just died, but his mother (his grandfather's heir) does not want a thing to do with the ranch, and she arranges to sell it - lock stock and barrel. And since Cole is underage there's not a thing he can do about it. So...<BR><BR>What follows is Cole's and Rawlins' odyssey in Mexico, and what an odyssey it is. They find work at a ranch, where Cole falls in love with the beautiful Alejandra. But because of events that occurred on the way to the ranch, their love is doomed and Cole and Rawlins learn some very hard lessons.<BR><BR>McCarthy's writing style is rather unique; you need to get used to it. But once you do the story flows very naturally and you develop a feel for all the characters in the story - except for Jimmy Blevins, who I never quite got a handle on. He was much more believable in the movie than in the book; I suppose because I had an actual person to look at instead of someone to just picture in my mind.<BR><BR>The only real complaint I have with this novel is that McCarthy seems to assume that the reader has a working knowledge of Spanish. I don't, and I'm only assuming that I interpreted certain Spanish conversations correctly. I would have benefitted from some kind of translation - whether in an index, in footnotes, or in some other form.	2001-06-14

But there's a step that the Appelfeld books I've read don't go beyond.  This book goes beyond that step - well beyond, and it's an extremely harrowing experience.  So harrowing, in fact, that I simply couldn't finish the book.<br />The writing and style is shaky - it varies from extremely good to jumpy and poorly written.  But considering the subject of this novel, the style of the writing doesn't really matter.  It's the time and place that are important here, and despite the variance of style, MacMillan more than puts his point across.  As one reviewer has already said, do not pick up this book expecting an easy read.  I didn't, and yet I still couldn't finish it.	2001-06-08

The character and his situation were unique in mystery literature, and the novel taught me more about forensic science than I ever thought possible.  I bought Deaver's next book featuring Rhyme, and I hope it's just as good as that one.  It better be, because \\"The Devil's Teardrop\\" is a couple of steps backward, especially for a writer with the talent of Jeffery Deaver.<br />The science and explanation of same are still first-rate - I learned a great deal about document examination.  Deaver's main characters - Parker Kincaid, the document examiner; Margaret Lukas, the FBI agent in charge of the case, and Cage, her colleague-...-supervisor, are all believable and fleshed-out people.  It's the secondary characters - Mayor Kennedy; Kincaid's ex-wife Joan, and Wendell Jefferies, the mayor's aide-de-camp, among others - who are the problem.  They appear to be taken from the generic pile of stock secondary characters that you can find in any B-movie that's been made over the last forty years.  You can spot what they'll say or do at least ten minutes before they say or do it.<br />As if that isn't bad enough, Deaver does these weird little jumps in his plotline - he doesn't explain how his characters knew an event was going to happen, or how they got where they are now, until they actually get there and/or save the day - then, and only then, does he have his characters explain what they did.  This is an extremely poor sequencing of the plot and is, to say the least, extremely confusing.<br />I still look forward to the next Lincoln Rhyme book, but I hope Deaver hasn't decided that the plot devices in this book are a good idea - because if he has, I for one will drop him like a hot potato.	2001-05-28

Tad Williams' journey into cyberspace concludes with this book, and while it's a worthy end to the series, I wish I could have given it five stars instead of four.<br />In my review of volume 3 of this series (&quot;Mountain of Black Glass&quot;), I mentioned that the character of Johnny Wulguru/Dread was one of the major weak spots of the story.  With &quot;Sea&quot;, Williams has remedied that situation, but there are some resolutions that just didn't satisfy.  For example, the &quot;fate&quot; of Long Joseph, Jeremiah Dako and Del Rey - the story explains what happened to them, and how they wound up where they wound up, but there was a whole chunk missing from the story that would have helped with the narrative.  The only explanation I can come up with is that perhaps Williams (or his editors) thought that sequence might be a bit too gory.  Also, the resolution of the Calliope Skouros story was, to put it bluntly, underwhelming.<br />But most of the threads of the &quot;Otherland&quot; quartet were resolved very well.  Felix Jongleur turned out to be the epitome of self-indulgence.  Though he was perceived as evil by most of the other characters in the story, he truly was not.  He was corrupt, yes - but there is a difference between corruption and evil.  Kunohara turned out to be an interesting character as well - he was also corrupt, but unlike Jongleur, still retained enough of his humanity to do the right thing when it counted.<br />The saddest part of &quot;Otherland&quot; is the ultimate fate of Olga Pirofsky, and her relationship with Jongleur and the being known as &quot;the Other&quot;.  I won't mention anything more about it except to say that even though there were hints in all of the previous books in this series, I never saw it coming.<br />Two more characters need to be mentioned.  Mr Sellars, who in the first three installments was a behind-the-scenes manipulator, comes into his own here.  He turns out to be very altruistic, but he came by his altruism at a very high price indeed.<br />Finally, why on earth did Williams feel the need to include a group of characters like the Wicked Tribe in his story?  Throughout each of the four volumes they were nothing short of annoying, and the series would have been much better without them.<br />All told, however, this is a very worthy conclusion to an excellent series.  Warts and all, this is still a quartet that is well worth your time.	2001-05-22

The Runa and the Jana'ata are fully realized races and cultures - not surprising since the author is an anthropologist.<br />I'll spare you the usual synopsis of the plot. That plot essentially deals with the clash between totally different peoples, races, and cultures. It could have taken place entirely on Earth, between, say, the technologically advanced modern world and the primitive people on a previously undiscovered island. But that would have limited what could be done with the story - so far as we know, the dominant life-forms on Earth are all human, and advanced or not, we're all essentially brothers and sisters under the cultural skin.<br />By injecting science fiction into her plot, Ms. Russell has given herself and her story the freedom to go wherever her imagination (and it's a VERY fertile imagination) takes her, by having this tale take place in a totally alien environment. And not only is her imagination impressive, but so is her education - if this book is indicative of her knowledge of her subject and the way she presents that knowledge to the world, I'd like to read some of her academic works. I'm so impressed that today, when I finished this book, I went to my local library and took out its sequel, &quot;Children of God&quot;. If that book is only half as good as this one, I'm in for an amazing experience.	2001-04-17

First is his best work - &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, and &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;.  On the other side is his worst stuff - &quot;Firestarter&quot;, &quot;Cujo&quot;, and &quot;Gerald's Game&quot;.  Most of the rest of his work falls into the third group - stories that are good but not great, or novels that King wrote on a day when he wasn't feeling quite up to snuff.<br />&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; falls into this middle category.  The plot moves along in a straight line (more or less), and the four main characters (Henry, Jonesy, Pete, and the Beaver - YES, the Beaver) keep the story moving well enough.  But the whole idea, physiology, and purpose of the aliens is extremely confusing.  Aside from the fact that they wanted to wipe out humanity, I'm not sure I understood anything about them.<br />King doesn't do science fiction/horror that often, but he can and has done better - witness &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;.  Coming as this does on the heels of &quot;On Writing&quot;, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is a big disappointment.	2001-04-02

The first book, &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, and now this one, are loaded with characters who never made me lose interest.  And while there seem at first glance to be a few too many plotlines, Martin does an excellent job of holding all the threads together.<br />I'm looking forward to the third book.

Unfortunately, the more recent books in the series have basically been clones of each other.  After several years, Brooks has come out with a new Shannara novel - and a new generation of Ohmsfords - and his storytelling abilities have demonstrably improved.<br />There are little blurbs of &quot;history&quot; throughout the book - enough so that if this is your first Shannara book, you'll have some idea of what's happened in the books you haven't read.  The Ilse Witch is a fully realized, completely evil character, as is the Druid Walker.  He was really only a cardboard cutout in Brooks' previous novels, but in this book Brooks has fleshed him out, made him a more complex being with many conflicting feelings and emotions.<br />I do think that Brooks could have made a better choice for the Ilse Witch's spy aboard the Jerle Shannara.  Without revealing the identity of said spy, I will say that this is the weakest, most pathetic character in the story - but Brooks may surprise us in the sequel and show us a completely different side of the spy's character.<br />Let's hope the sequel comes out soon.  I'd like to know what the treasure everybody's after really is.	2001-02-08

Nathan Price is the most self-righteous, most pitiful self-appointed reformer I've ever met in my many literary travels.  His wife, Orleanna, is his exact opposite - and more than a match for him, though he never realizes it, and you won't believe it for at least half the book.<br />But it's their daughters that are the heart and soul of this book.  Yes, the book deals with all the Price family, their internal conflicts and their interaction with the local populace (and Reverend Price's inability to acclimate himself to Congolese culture), but Rachel, Ruth May, and especially Leah and Adah, will be raised in this environment - and the friendships they make and the things they learn will shape their lives, the lives of their families, and to some extent the lives of the people of the emerging nation-state called at various times Congo and Zaire.<br />There are some vague similarites to Paul Theroux' &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;, but don't pick up this book expecting a clone of Theroux' work.  That book was great, but this is much better.	2001-01-31
US	53067436	R25XO3ZZ4FFKIQ	0449002640	442800937	The Unlikely Spy	Books	4	152	157	N	Y	An &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; clone - and a good one	There are definite elements of Ken Follett's &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; in Daniel Silva's &quot;The Unlikely Spy&quot;.  The most obvious is that Follett's bumbling spy was named Godliman, Silva's is named Vicary.  But there are differences too - and those differences make Silva's book better than Follett's.<br />Most of the novels of this type follow a formula - Nazi spy, planted in England, uncovers the real facts about the Normandy invasion, and the brave, muddle-headed British intelligence officer must stop the spy before s/he gives it all away.  Silva's novel follows this formula fairly well, but there's a very well-written story surrounding it.<br />Silva's plot is extremely detailed, and there are puzzles within puzzles, and plots within plots.  Alfred Vicary is the proverbial (and in some cases literal) absent-minded professor, who shows a surprising streak of ruthlessness when it really matters; Catherine Blake is the Third Reich's ultimate weapon, who would rather not do what she's been doing for the last five years, but has no choice in the matter.  These are the two main characters in a very well-done WWII spy novel.<br />This is Silva's first novel, and if it's any indication of things to come, he has a glorious career ahead of him.  I do hope he doesn't restrict himself to this genre, though - if he does his books will grow very stale very fast.	2001-01-07

Throw in the basic plot of the third Indiana Jones movie and a few old &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes and you have a book that'll make you scream &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; after a few chapters.  Why anyone would read, let alone write, such claptrap is beyond me.  I do notice that this book and its sequels are on special order (4 - 6 weeks for delivery) which means that the publisher doesn't think too highly of it either; they have to dig it out of the basement whenever it's ordered.<br />With any luck this will be out of print soon and it'll only be an extremely bad memory.	2001-01-01

It's a cookbook (although I will take a previous reviewer's warning to heart and be careful about following the recipes); it's a reminiscence of sorts (the memories of Ehrlich's mother-in-law Miriam and others about European/American/immigrant Jewish life in the era of World War II); and finally, it's a book about a certain way of Jewish living.  All three of these books are wonderful.<br />The chapters with recipes in them put me in mind of the movie &quot;The Big Night&quot; (that's the one where you saw all that marvelous food being prepared in Stanley Tucci's restaurant in preparation for Louis Prima's visit).  These parts of the book are the print equivalent - my mouth watered just reading about the preparation of those dishes.<br />The other parts of the book describe a world that's fast becoming extinct.  There is a new wave of religious fervor in Judaism, but it's just not the same as the religion my grandparents observed.  That was a meeting of the Old World with the New, and I don't really think that will happen again.<br />I do hope that Ehrlich writes a sequel (or some columns for distribution in newspapers or magazines).  I'd like to know how she and her family are continuing to reconcile their version of religion with secular America.  I'm sure it will become harder once Miriam and Jacob, her in-laws, pass on.  They have been her teachers and guides (Miriam more so than Jacob), and I would like to know if she's truly acquired their commitment as well as their recipes.	2000-11-18

That doesn't lessen the enjoyment at all; on the contrary, it makes the story easier to read.  And it would also make it easier to follow, if it weren't for the fact that there seem to be a lot of gaps in the story.  I wasn't at all sure why several characters came into the tale, and where exactly they figured into it.<br />But I did enjoy what I could follow of the mystery, and I was affected by the subplot of Sir John's wife and her illness.  Sir John and Jeremy are two very promising characters, and I hope to see more of them in future installments of this series.  Hopefully Mr. Alexander will improve on his &quot;flow&quot; in the next book.	2000-11-09

In terms of style and writing &quot;Merrick&quot; is up to Rice's usual high standards, and it is noteworthy in that it brings her vampires and witches (although not the &quot;main&quot; Mayfairs) together.  But the plot reads like &quot;a day in the life&quot; of David, Louis, and Merrick (and Lestat, to a small degree) - until the last few chapters; then (as others have indicated) the story gets REALLY interesting.  These last few chapters leave you begging for Rice's next book - and I hope it comes out soon.<br />Unfortunately, except for those last few chapters, although the writing is excellent, the subject matter is very drab.  It's the writing and style that gets this review its three stars.	2000-11-02

And given his last few books, I think that's a safe statement.  This is only King's second non-fiction work (his first, &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, was out of print last time I looked), but he's definitely got a good track record for the genre.<br />He starts off with a brief autobiography, and we learn first-hand what makes the Master tick (i.e., how he got started and why he writes what he writes).  I'm a fan, but I had no idea that King was a recovering substance abuser (sorry for the spoiler, folks) until I read this book - or that his mother was (not by choice) a single parent.  King doesn't spare us or himself - he delivers the full story of his life until now, warts and all.<br />Then he launches into what he believes makes a good writer (at least, what worked for him).  Most of this is, of course, just common sense - at least, it does now that I've read it.  But it's King's style of writing that's the hook here.  He doesn't use big words, and his explanations are easily understandable by the average person on the street.<br />I do have some disagreements with King, though.  For one thing, he apparently praises John Grisham, one of the worst writers ever to make the best-seller lists.  He says, &quot;critics who dismissed THE FIRM and Grisham's later books as poorly written and who profess themselves to be mystified by his success are either missing the point because it's so big and obvious or because they are being deliberately obtuse.&quot;  He then says that Grisham wrote about something he knows, and that makes the book &quot;brave and uniquely satisfying.&quot;  Sorry, Stephen - but that's EXACTLY the point - the fact that Grisham is writing about something he knows doesn't detract from the fact that his style is something out of a &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; book, and that he probably took lessons on other facets of the craft from Danielle Steele or Jackie Collins.<br />But that's only my opinion.  It doesn't detract from the fact that in general, King haswritten an excellent primer on writing.<br />One other thing.  The last section of the book deals with King's auto accident in 1999.  Again, he doesn't omit any of the details of this portion of his life.  He will have to update it for the paperback version, since Bryan Smith died a month or so ago.	2000-10-20

I'm not so sure that I'd compare this book to &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;.  That tale was way too intellectual for me, and I just couldn't get through all the philosophical and religious gobbledy-gook.<br />While &quot;Instance&quot; contains a lot of philosophy and religion as well, it is much less highbrow and much easier for the average reader to understand.  And to me, that makes it a much better book than &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;.<br />Each of the four narrators of this book is a fully-realized individual.  In his portion, da Cola seems to be a 17th century combination of a Renaissance man and Gomer Pyle - but things aren't always what they seem.  As is the case with Jack Prestcott, who seems like a remarkably intelligent and sane individual - until you read Dr. Wallis' and Wood's account.  Wallis is one of the most cold-blooded and frightening personalities I've ever had the displeasure of meeting; and in comparison to the other three, Wood seems like a sort of 17th century Everyman.<br />Each of the four narrations adds to your knowledge of the general tale.  You need to read them in order, but each narration on its own makes a fascinating read.  However, I could have done without Wood's account of the final fate of Sarah Blundy.  That part of his story is straight out of left field, and is the only reason I can't give this book five stars.  It is completely unbelievable and doesn't mesh with the rest of Wood's narration - or with any of the others for that matter.  Reading that particular part of the story I had to wonder what Mr. Pears was smoking when he wrote it.<br />If you can put that part of the tale aside, &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot; is well worth your time.	2000-09-26

I was very surprised to find that I disliked this book so intensely, because I'm a huge fan of Lady James' Adam Dalgliesh mystery series.  But  all that appears to happen here is talk - mostly about the philosophy of  the current situation, which is &quot;what's going to happen now that  nobody in the world can have a child?&quot;<br />Granted, there's not much  action in the Dalgliesh series either - James is very cerebral - but this  is a bit much.

He is amoral, sociopathic, and  quite possibly a psychopath.  He has also never quite grown up.  And I do  dislike Ripley - INTENSELY.<br />But &quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; deals  with all its other major characters (with the exception of Dickie  Greenleaf's father) in much the same way.  They all appear to have a severe  case of arrested development, and have never grown up emotionally and  assumed the responsibilities that come with being an adult.<br />The  impression carries over into Highsmith's writing.  I would not care to buy  another Ripley novel.  I might be interested in purchasing one of her other  books, but Thomas Ripley and his world (and the way it's written about) is  totally abhorrent to me.	2000-07-09

I'm not sure whether McMurtry ever intended to write more books featuring Gus McCrae &amp; Woodrow Call, but I'm certainly glad he  did.  And it's only fitting, somehow, that the book that says on its cover,  &quot;the final volume of the Lonesome Dove story&quot;, be almost as good  as the first.<br />We learn about some of the things that Gus and Woodrow  referred to in that first book.  We learn something about why Jake is the  way he is in that first book.  And we also learn a lot about Newt and his  future relationships with the rangers.  There's a lot more, but it would  take a lot more than a thousand words to mention everything.<br />I do have  some problems with this book - not with McMurtry's writing, but with the  way the publisher laid it out.  First of all, check out the back cover -  Gus McCrae's first name is Augustus, NOT August.  And check out the  spelling of some of the words in the book.  I didn't think McMurtry was  British or Canadian; I don't remember &quot;behavior&quot; being spelled in  the British manner in &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, but here it's spelled  &quot;behaviour&quot; consistently - and other words follow suit.  The  publishers better go over the next edition of this book very carefully so  they can avoid these kinds of mistakes.	2000-07-02

So I picked up &quot;A  Grave Talent&quot; with very low expectations.<br />Was I ever surprised!   This is an incredibly good mystery that never lets up on the suspense.  I  had a problem for a while with the obvious intelligence and education of  Kate Martinelli and Al Hawkin, but soon realized that I'd simply been  reading too many 87th Precinct stories and watching too much &quot;NYPD  Blue&quot;.  I just thought all cops were like that, and it's a pleasure to  find out that I was wrong.<br />The flow of the case was completely logical  and totally believable.  And the three main characters - Kate, Hawkin, and  Lee - were also completely believable.  I also appreciated the fact that  King didn't even mention the nature of Kate's relationship with Lee until  halfway through the story.  It turned out to be important to the story, but  still King never really made it the primary issue.<br />I have one wish and  one complaint.  The wish is that I'd like to see more of Vaun Adams.  She's  a very interesting character and she's someone I'd like to see and hear  more of.  The complaint?  Without giving anything away, the fate of Lee  Cooper is a shock and a real downer.  I hope that's resolved positively in  future installments in this series.<br />And I hope there are future  installments.  King should throw the Mary Russell series away (it's been  going downhill since &quot;Beekeeper&quot;) and concentrate on Kate  Martinelli.  If this is any indication she's got a great thing going.	2000-05-31

First, I have to voice my one major complaint - and it's not with the book per se, but rather with the little blurb on the cover of the paperback edition, to wit: &quot;Astonishing...will keep readers up late at night until the last page is turned.&quot;  This will give people the mistaken  impression that this is a mystery or a thriller.  Nothing could be further  from the truth.  There are hints all through the novel as to what really  happened that night, and the epilogue merely confirms them.<br />That blurb  does not, however, detract from the story being told - a midwife is charged  with unintentionally killing her patient (believing she was already dead  due to a cerebral hemhorrage), and with practicing medicine without a  license.  That is an extremely simple description of what is an extremely  well-written novel.  Every event is totally believable, and almost every  character is totally believable.  The one exception is the widowed father,  Asa, who does not seem to be as fleshed out as the rest of the characters  in the novel.<br />The novel does not make a case either way for or against  midwifery or home birth, but rather describes a fictional account of what  must be every midwife's worst nightmare.  Whether you are for or against  the subject, or even if you have no opinion on it, I guarantee you will not  look at home birth and at midwives the same way after reading this book.	2000-04-30

I first became a fan of Tad Williams with \\"Tailchaser's Song\\", and then found the \\"Memory Sorrow & Thorn\\" trilogy (quartet if you bought it in paperback). He was a good writer even then, but somehow I always felt there was something missing.<br />With the \\"Otherland\\" series, Williams has definitely come into his own, and each book in this series has been better than the last.<br />The major weakness so far has been the character of Dread/Johnny Wulguru, who quite frankly isn't as scary as Williams wants us to think he is - the members of the Grail Brotherhood are much more frightening. But the description of the ersatz Trojan War is definitely unsettling, to say the least, and the climax of this book is incredible. I can't wait for the fourth and final volume in this series. I want to know the results of Calliope Skouros' investigation, and the ultimate role of Olga Pirofsky in this little drama - and, of course, the fate of Renie, Paul Jonas, Orlando Gardiner, and all the others stuck in the virtual reality that is Otherland.	2000-03-02

I will agree with some of the previous reviewers, in that this book dealt almost exclusively with the negative side of the human experience (and in some cases that's putting it mildly).  But Ms. Morris knows how to write,  and does a superb job here.  She never failed to hold my interest - though  the plot started to sag a little bit at the end.<br />The dialog was a bit  stilted, and some of the characters (mostly the secondary ones) were a bit  unbelievable (Sam Fermoyle's shrink at the institute, for one) - and does  anyone actually KNOW someone who says &quot;Yah&quot; instead of  &quot;Yeah&quot;?

I haven't been so impressed with a Stephen King novel in years - not since &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;, and he wrote that back in the 70's.<br />I'm impressed with this for far different reasons, of course.  &quot;Salem's  Lot&quot; was a pure horror novel - a small town in Maine is visited by a  vampire.  &quot;Tom Gordon&quot;, by contrast, deals with a totally  different kind of horror.  No vampires, werewolves, or any of the other  creatures King's dark imagination has come up with in his other novels.  No, this horror is something that everyone can identify with in one form or  another - the horror that occurs when a child turns up missing.  King deals  mostly with the child's point of view here - what happens to that child  when she loses her way, to put it euphemistically.<br />In this case, Trisha  McFarland's imagination simply runs wild.  She imagines good things - her  conversations with Red Sox relief pitcher Tom Gordon, for example - and bad  things - the &quot;thing&quot; that is following her throughout her  journey.  I won't spoil the resolution of that particular part of the  story, except to say that it has a happy ending.<br />And I actually cried  when I got to the end of this book - something I never dreamed I'd do for a  Stephen King novel.<br />Oh, it's not perfect - but it's a damn sight better  than a lot of what King has written over the last few years.  And because  of the kind of horror it deals with, it's also one of his most frightening  books ever.	1999-04-24

I could only  remember that it was the story of two moles, Bracken and Rebecca, and how  they brought peace, prosperity, and other assorted good things to their  &quot;system&quot;, as Horwood calls it - the title, Duncton Wood.  The  book has long been out of print in this country, so I despaired of ever  getting my hands on a copy again.<br />Well, a few years ago, I was on  vacation in England, and was very pleasantly surprised to discover that  Duncton Wood was still in print there.  Not only that, but it was the first  book in a series about the moles of Duncton, and all of them (according to  the local reviews) were just as good as the first!  Sad to say, I didn't  take the opportunity to buy those books then, but I recently managed to get  my hands on a copy of Duncton Wood through one of Amazon's European  competitors.  I'm only halfway through it now, but it's just as good the  second time around.<br />This is as basic a story as you can get about good  vs. evil, and there are very few who tell it better than Horwood.  There  are definite religious elements in this story (and, I assume, in the  sequels as well), but who cares when the story is written this well?<br />I  look forward to finishing Duncton Wood, and to getting my hands on the  sequels.  Unfortunately, Amazon apparently only deals with American  publishers, so they can't get their hands on any of them - so this is a  very blunt hint to the American publishing establishment:  get off your  duffs and get the American publishing rights to these books!

I put the word war in quotes because it's not your average war story - it's not on the same playing field as, say, Leon Uris' &quot;Battle Cry&quot;, or &quot;The 13th Valley&quot;; it's more along the lines of Clavell's &quot;King Rat&quot;, although I found this book to be much more human than &quot;Rat&quot;.<br /> In 1952, Joe Sandingham lives in Hong Kong - but during the war, he was captured by the Japanese and placed in several of their POW camps - first in Hong Kong, then several others along the way, finally winding up in Japan.  This is the story both of Joe's experiences during the war, and of his life after the war is over, which was a direct result of his time in the POW camps.  The title of the book should be a dead giveaway as to one of his experiences; indeed, this book contains some of the most harrowing descriptions of the aftermath of the Hiroshima bomb that I've ever read.<br /> If you can get your hands on this book in a used-book store, by all means buy it.	1998-05-07
US	53067436	R1EGY9RFFKXDFK	0451179897	861505057	House of Smoke	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Good detective story, but you gotta trust somebody	Once you get over the shock of transition from a traditional past-tense narrative in the prologue to a present-tense one in the rest of the book, this turns out to be a very well-written mystery in the tradition of the Lew Archer series, and of &quot;Chinatown&quot; and &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; - except that here the detective is a woman, and the characters representing the power are also women.<br />Freedman writes very well and I found myself drawn in almost against my will.  I believed that every one of these characters could actually exist.<br />My complaints?  At the risk of sounding chauvinistic, all of Freedman's most powerful characters are women.  I believed in these characters especially, but in terms of gender this book seems a little lopsided.  Also, with two exceptions (not including Kate), every character in this book seems to have some kind of ulterior motive for what he or she does, or is involved in the murders to some degree.  I'm reminded of Deep Throat's last words to Dana Scully in &quot;The X-files&quot;: &quot;Trust no one.&quot;<br />I hope that Freedman writes another book featuring Kate Blanchard, but he doesn't have to be so conspiracy-minded if he does.	1998-04-05

It gives a synopsis of sorts of a great many of the previous books in the series, and while it's no substitute for those books, you'll at least have an idea of what's gone on in all those previous books.<br />The plot, I have to admit, is something straight out of the pulp fiction school, and sounds like something Bradley has done before - but that doesn't detract from the excellent quality of the writing, something that's been sorely lacking in the more recent Darkover novels. Still, this novel made me want to go back and reread even those. Who knows - maybe I'll change my mind about them after reading this one.	1998-03-13

While the woman named Kettle turns out to be vital to the story, the way she's introduced seems almost like an afterthought. And the ultimate fate of Prince Verity, though interesting, was, to put it bluntly, underwhelming. I would also have liked to see that part of the storyline extended a bit - what happens to Verity after he saves the day (I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that, but I would if I said anything more)?<br />The resolution of Fitz's and Molly's relationship is very touching, and left me wishing that it could have been otherwise. Ms. Hobb is a very good author - her writing style is excellent, but her plots need a bit more \\"seasoning\\", or sophistication. I see by the blurb at the end of this book that she's starting a new series. I hope that her stories improve with experience.	1998-01-23

Ed McBain's 87th Precinct series was getting very boring, and everything else seems to be just rehashing of the same tired old plots - so it's a welcome change to see this great debut novel from Ms. Fairstein, and it's also good news to note that she plans more novels with her heroine, Alexandra Cooper.<br />Everything about this book is great - Cooper herself, her relationship with both detectives Mercer Wallace and Mike Chapman (I found myself hoping that Cooper & Chapman would get together, but no such luck), and especially her descriptions of the way things work in the Sex Crimes Unit, which sounded exactly right. The title is a reference to Cooper & Chapman's passion for the game show with Alex Trebek, which is really obscure in the greater scheme of the novel - but that's a minor nit, really.  More of a problem was the character of Jed Segal, who I found very unbelievable, especially his high-falutin' style of speech (do people REALLY talk like that?).<br />The resolution of the case - who really killed Cooper's movie star friend - is a bit out of left field, although as several characters in the book point out, the resolutions of a lot of police cases are found due to nothing but pure luck - so that took the edge off of the unbelievability for me.<br />My only other complaint, Ms. Fairstein? I've never seen Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Notorious\\". I know it's a classic, but please don't go spoiling the endings of any other movies for me - let me find out on my own!	1997-12-25

There's a story in that section called &quot;Instant Care&quot; that had me rolling on the floor.  I can readily identify with Ms. White's mother - she's a real character! There are other stories that are not as funny - but then, they're not meant to be - and they're just as good.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book.	1997-11-26

So far, this has been a great series, and this book is no exception. I just wish that Mr. Kellerman hadn't gone into so much detail about the psychological information he presents in his book - that put me to sleep REAL fast.<br />This story's been done before - but never quite in this way. The plot was totally believable, although the character of Souza the lawyer wasn't - he seemed to be too pompous to be true. But Delaware does ring very true, as does his policeman buddy, Milo Sturgis.<br />I know that a new Alex Delaware novel has just come out - I look forward to reading it, but I prefer to read series in order, so I don't miss anything. I just hope that Kellerman de-emphasizes the research in the rest of his books. I grant that it's important, but he should know when enough is enough.	1997-11-22

The story opens with a great premise - a mobster on trial for murder has his psychotic friend and enforcer select one member of the jury, and threaten all she holds dear unless she can persuade the rest of the jury to return a verdict of \\"not guilty\\". While the book deals with the trial and the deliberations of the jurors, it's gripping, terrifying, and makes you wonder what could possibly happen next.<br />But then the verdict comes in - and you discover that there's still a third of the book left - and from that point on, the story takes a sharp turn into overkill. What happens after the verdict is given is totally unbelievable - although, to Green's credit, the eventual resolution of the story did pique my interest again. The characters of the Teacher and Annie are totally believable - again, right up until the verdict is read, and then I couldn't believe a thing they did afterwards.<br />The best character in the story? Slavko Czernyk, the private detective who's killed off about halfway through. What a pity. If Green had made him the principal character, or if he had resolved the plot almost immediately after the verdict, this would have been a compelling, un-putdownable thriller. As it is, though, this book reminds me of a lot of movie reviews I've heard recently - great first and second acts, but it collapses in the third act.	1997-10-22

For example - I'd like to see Aurian confront the Phaerie and thereby resolve the situation with the Xandim.  Also, what actually happened to the rest of the Great Cats?  We only hear that they left their home - but did they leave or were they killed off, or what?  A sequel to this &quot;conclusion&quot; definitely needs to be written, but for what it is, this book is excellent.	1997-10-13

As soon as you open the book and start reading it, you feel as though you are actually in India - Mann's descriptive powers, both of people and places, are that good.  And, as with &quot;Season&quot;, the violence is mostly implied, and yet you cringe at it just the same (it's implied except for the scenes with the swami and the cobra, and I REALLY cringed at that). My only complaint with the book was with the character of Annie Ginnaro.  Because a major part of the book deals with expatriated American hippies, her role is a necessary one, but somehow, she still seems out of place to me.  A lot of Mann's story seems stilted when Annie is involved.  But I'm still anxiously awaiting the third Sansi mystery, which is currently available in hardcover	1997-08-22

A terrific continuation of a terrific fantasy series....and I still have absolutely no idea who Jack really is, and how he obtained his powers.  The suspense is killing me!  I'd also like to ask Ms. Jones a question, if she ever browses Amazon's site - when do Bodger and Grift get their own series?  They are two of the funniest sidekicks I've ever encountered in the many realms of fantasy - although, from the hints that were dropped in this volume, I have a feeling that they won't be sidekicks for too much longer	1997-07-08

The language is incredibly simplistic, the plot devices make no sense and are totally unbelievable in any case.  If the rest of the books in this series are of the same caliber, it's a wonder that the author has continued it for as long as he has.  In short, this book is awful.  The 3 is for the scenery and the author's description of life in colonial Egypt, which is somewhat believable	1997-05-18
US	53067436	R3SPQUCH6EO76R	0316955280	212896016	The Glory: A Novel	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Junior-grade &quot;War &amp; Remembrance&quot;	This book and its predecessor, &quot;The Hope&quot;, aren't in the same league as Wouk's great duo, &quot;The Winds of War&quot; and &quot;War &amp; Remembrance&quot;, but taken by themselves, they're a very good fictionalization of Israel's history in modern times.  My rating is purely because I personally can't help the comparison, although the first series seemed to me to have a more global scope, and Wouk's characters there seemed more fleshed out. The characters here are not cardboard cutouts by any means, but one gets the impression on reading this that Wouk has submerged the history to some degree in favor of the personal lives of the characters - or, more importantly, that he's delved too deeply into the lives of his fictionalized real people at the expense of some of the history.  Most notable here are Golda Meir, Menachem Begin, and especially Ariel Sharon, who Wouk here portrays as obsessed to the nth degree about his goals, and Moshe Dayan, who Wouk obviously idolizes a little too much.    I'm not trying to discourage anyone from reading these two books, but I am suggesting that they be taken with a grain of salt	1997-03-30

Her husband, Ross, can be best described as the scum of the earth - he married Daria simply because he saw her as an ornament to his life and career, but now he's met a plain-looking woman who happens to be incredibly rich, and he's also involved himself with several shady (to put it mildly) business deals, one of which involves burning out the tenants of buildings he owns in Daria's old neighborhood.  But he doesn't actually own them; Daria does, and....well, this gets very complicated.<br />The point here is that Daria gradually discovers all this, and it shatters her.  She has to rebuild her life from the ground up, and finds unlikely allies in the tenants of these buildings.  Ms. Piercy makes you believe that Daria is a real person, that this isn't just a piece of fiction.  Daria, and all the characters in this book, come to incredibly vivid life.  The greatest compliment I can pay to this novel is that I wish Ms. Piercy would write another one with these characters - which, considering that this book is over ten years old, she may well have done.  I'd very much like to know what else happens to Daria, Tom, and all the other people in this world Marge Piercy has created.  The rating of 9 is only because I detected a stiffness at times in the language of her characters - but that's a very minor detraction in an otherwise excellent book	1997-03-30
