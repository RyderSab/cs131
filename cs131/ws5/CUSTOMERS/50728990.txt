Very few things make me laugh out loud, but I found myself in hysterics at the closing scenes.  I'm not a fan of soap operas, but I do appreciate their spoofs.  Bailey is the head writer for a show called All the Bold Days of My Restless Life.  Every horrible cliche that applies to this type of show is attached to this one.  What can you say about a show that has a main character named Aruba, her mother is Myrtle Beach and her stepsister is Bermuda Schwartz?  Bailey's private life could be a feature story on her soap.  After her girlfriend dumps her, her friend Peter arranges the three blind dates from hell.  The first is with a woman who has a midnight online sex show and likes to use her dates as her \\"special guests.\\"  The second regales Bailey with details about why she has six children and how that has convinced her to start dating women.  The last is a cop who gets drunk and starts shooting rats as they walk down the street, causing an encounter with some of New York City's finest.  And then there is the fact that the two major stars of the show spend all of their time trying to do each other in professionally.  Yes, it's light reading, not great literature, but sometimes it's just fun to read that. <br />	2005-09-18
US	50728990	RN0YZT09VEPVJ	0975436619	14846593	Our Reunion	Books	4	25	25	N	Y	A well told story	This is the story of two women who are reintroduced at a high school reunion after not seeing each other for twenty-five years. Tina suffered a tragedy years before that has caused her life to take a sometimes dark and usually lonely path.  Sam responds by believing that she can be a good friend to a woman she has had a crush on since they were in school.  As that friendship develops, the women discover the possibility of a much deeper relationship.  Has the story been told before?  Certainly.  But that misses a more important issue.  Too often these books race through a story, letting things happen with no explanation or character development.  That is how this book is different.  You have a chance to understand these women.  You see the relationship unfold gradually and you develop a feeling for who they are and why they behave as they do.  Yet, the pace of the book is not slow.  It's one of those books where you've read twenty pages before you know it.  I've read hundreds of lesbian novels, so I've certainly encounted similar stories, but this one stands out because it's told better than most.  If you give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.	2005-08-27

It's full of adventure, intrigue and suspense.  Addison Black is every woman's dream - secret agent, daring, efficient, strong - and a woman.  She's the agent that the British send in when they want to make sure a job will be done.  And she works alone.  She has her hands full in this book trying to save the Drs. Tidwell, mother and daughter, from agents trying to get control of a new biological weapon.  Dr. Skye Tidwell, the daughter, becomes especially important as she is rescued, twice, and becomes Addison's first partner.  The fact that Addison isn't sure that any of this is a good idea just adds to the story.  This is one you won't be able to put down.	2005-07-17

Andrea \\"Andi\\" Kane loses her job, her girlfriend and her grandmother asks her to solve a 65 year old murder all on the same day.  What else could possibly have gone wrong?  Well, she ends up walking barefoot on a cold street with nothing but the clothes on her back and no idea where to go when her girlfriend throws her out of the house.  Don't think Andi is a loser or pathetic, she's just having some life problems.  As she moves back in with her parents and searches for the answers to those problems, she is presented with a mystery by her grandmother concerning her great grandfather.  He was convicted of a murder in 1939 and sent to prison, where he died.  Andi's grandmother is convinced her father was innocent and, before she dies, she wants Andi to prove it.  Andi finds herself in HiHo, Texas, with a fascinating cast of characters, not the least of whom is the district attorney, Janice Reed.  As Andi tries to unravel the mystery, she unleashes old family pains, unsettles the realtionships in the small town and discovers information that could doom a budding relationship with Janice.  Can life be more complicated?  Well, yes, for Andi anyway.  I have read all of Jones' books and this is her best by far.  It shows a maturity of writing and story development that she hasn't exhibited until now.  Whatever has changed, her ability to write has improved tremendously and makes this a very enjoyable book to read.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-10

Cara Cipriano and Jake Biscayne have a history.  A couple of years before the book begins, Cara humiliated Jake as she testified in another case.  Neither of them has forgotten it and their dislike for each other is apparent when they are brought together to work on the same case.  Both of them want to find the person who is leaving bodies on both sides of the Mexican border.  The book features wonderful character development and vivid descriptions of the landscape of the area.  Cara and Jake are drawn progressively closer together until a sudden flood catches them unaware in the desert.  Cara is seriously hurt helping Jake and Jake feels responsible to help her recover, which becomes a turning point in their relationship.  A number of supporting characters assist in fleshing out this book and provide memorable moments.  There is violence in the book, but it is appropriate to the story.  And there is a terrible betrayal near the end of the story which provides a shock quality.  The action is fast paced and the descriptive work in the story makes you feel like you're in the scenes.  This book does have a sequel, Threads of Destiny, which elaborates on the character developments and some of the subplots.  If you like mystery, adventure, romance and magnetic characters, you definitely want to buy this book.	2005-01-08

Dr. Allison Shaunessy, an archaeologist from Australia, wants to launch an expedition into Antarctica to find the possible remains of the Finlayson Expedition.  She is trying to prove that Finlayson was actually the first explorer to reach that continent, but she's having trouble raising the money to cover the costs.  Enter Dr. Michela DeGrasse, a psychologist with the International Space Research Institute, who is working on psychological studies for the first Mars mission and would like to go on the expedition to study how the team interacts under adverse circumstances.  Michela manages to find the descendent of Finlayson, who is willing to fund the project, if she heads it.  The rest of the story unfolds as these two strong-willed women get to know each other and try to find a way to work together, while struggling with a physical attraction that surprises both of them.  They do find Finlayson and a surprise they hadn't counted on.  And they discover something about themselves, too. This is a really good read.	2004-11-19

This one definitely belongs in the fiction column though.  From the moment it was published, people have been coming forward to refute what it says.  One of the admirals who is quoted questioning Kerry has been caught in the fact that he signed the papers for Kerry's commendations and wrote letters extolling him as a fine officer.  The Swift Boat veterans who are included did NOT serve with Kerry, so how do they know what happened on his boat?  Evidence has been discovered that this group is connected to the Bush campaign, so the book is nothing but propaganda.  There's nothing wrong with that as long as the reader knows what he is getting.  If you read this or see Fahrenheit 9-11 and KNOW that both are distortions to benefit certain political philosophies, then you should be OK.	2004-08-23

I will say be careful where you read it.  I had to go to the hospital emergency room and made the mistake of taking this book to read between the tests.  The author obviously likes the Three Stooges.  Not only does she use them in the book, but she writes many scenes that they could have performed.  I kept wanting to laugh out loud, just guffaw, which is not encouraged in a hospital, so I had to keep sticking my face in a pillow.  I'm probably lucky I didn't end up on the psych ward.  Sara and Chloe reminded me of the love,hate relationships that Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn specialized in.  If you've ever loved someone so much that you wanted to knock their blocks off for the way they were behaving, you'll love these two. The whole book is not funny, but the rest of the story is satisfying also. Great story, great characters, great read.	2004-08-18

She has come to realize that she has put off many things she would like to do in her life while she was waiting for things to improve between her and her ex-partner. She can't wait any longer for some of the things she wants and the first of those is a baby.  She finds a doctor who is willing to work with her and during the process, a new lover...her doctor, Aubrey.  The book deals with the developing pregnancy and the relationship, which is complicated by their fears about trusting someone else, the appearance of both ex-lovers who want to try again and an automobile accident that could end everything they are hoping to achieve.  The writing is simplistic and things seem to develop too rapidly to be realistic, not to mention a possible conflict of ethics about a doctor sleeping with her patient, but it's a better than average story.	2004-08-08

That doesn't mean Susan hasn't formed some very stereotypical opinions of what the people there must be like.  Mae is a Texas cowgirl, descended from generations of people who have worked the land and totally in touch with her environment.  She also carries the sadness of having lost her partner two years before to a drunk driver and is determined that nothing will ever hurt her like that again.  Their worlds collide when Susan gets a flat tire on a country road and Mae offers to change it for her.  There is instant chemistry between them, but that won't be enough.  Can Susan overcome her prejudices and can Mae let someone else into her heart?  The book does a good job of developing the story, though, as an easterner, I did get a little tired of the emphasis on the snooty easterners who turned up their noses at the hicks from the south.

US	50728990	R18OOVT5LIO0M7	1932667121	223715037	Threads of Destiny	Books	5	4	6	N	Y	Excellent book!!	SNIPPET FROM REVIEW of FIRST EDITION  This book is the sequel to Incommunicado by Mercer and Nancy Hill.  That was a good book, this is even better.  This book ties together the strings left dangling in the first book.  It's full of adventure, emotion and tension.  A great read.    REVIEW OF SECOND EDITION    The idea of reading the second edition of a book I was already familiar with never made much sense in the past.   If you already know the story, what is the point?  However, word was that there were significant changes in this new edition, both through new words and a thorough editing, so I decided I should read it and I learned a valuable lesson.   When an author revisits her work and teams up with a talented editor, a good book can be made even better and show more depth than before.    Threads of Destiny is the story of Cara Cipriano, a lawyer and vintner in Santa Barbara, and Jake Biscayne, a leading FBI forensic pathologist and profiler.  Mercer and Nancy Hill first introduced their story in Incommunicado; however, through a skillful use of flashbacks and inventive dialogue, Mercer provides enough of the original story in this volume that it is not necessary to have read the first book to follow the action.  The women fell in love while they were working together to solve a string of brutal murders along the Mexican border, only to have their relationship ripped apart by a tragedy that Cara could not cope with and Jake knew nothing about.  Threads reunites them a year later when Cara returns to take over as padrone of the family vineyard and discovers that someone is using the business to smuggle drugs across the border.  When she asks the government for help, she and Jake are brought together in an uncomfortable situation while they try to solve the crime.  Two stories then unfold in the book.  One is a mystery and adventure story about the drug running that eventually includes kidnapping and a dramatic conclusion.  Simultaneously, Cara and Jake struggle to deal with their emotions and whether or not they can rebuild the relationship they once had.  Not until the very last page is that question answered and the reader cannot be certain of the answer until then.    There are a number of things to like about Mercer's writing.  Even though it is fiction, the characters ring true as actual people.  Women usually don't fall in love immediately in life and they sometimes hurt each other.  Jake can't forgive Cara immediately for deserting her even after she learns the reason for Cara's actions and she shouldn't.  You almost find yourself hoping that Jake will fall for a new interest McKenzie, even though you know the pain that Cara suffers because of her actions.  The frustration of Jake, the despair of Cara and the pure evil of Sandro the drug runner/murderer come off of the pages powerfully.  Mercer is very deft at keeping you on the edge of just not being sure how these stories will resolve themselves until they are finished.    The dialogue from other languages, with no translations, shows the respect that Mercer has for her reader being able to infer the meaning from the story.  The knowledge of the wine making process, forensic details, and the inside dealing of the cocaine trade indicate a book that was thoroughly researched.  Mercer's writing is very tight.  There are no wasted scenes or words to distract the reader from the action and emotion that drive the stories.  There are secondary characters who add color and dimension to the book, like Cara's childhood friend and would be lover Maggie, Matt Peyson, the Federal agent who loves Jake, but knows he has to look elsewhere for happiness, McKenzie the alluring woman who has feelings for both Cara and Jake, and Sandro, evil incarnate, the childhood friend of Jake and Matt who has betrayed their love for him and who is the killer determined to make Cara pay for interfering in his business.  They combine to create a world that feels all too real.  Mercer has createdone of those books that is hard to put down once you have started it.    The original version of Threads of Destiny had a very short life in the bookstores, so P.D. Publishing has done readers a service in bringing it back in an improved form.  Now readers will have the chance to discover the book that it deserves.	2004-07-30

People always talk about the lack of money, but independent companies are always making terrific movies on shoe string budgets.  When will someone realize the market that's out there for really good lesbian stories in the movies?  This is a great story, well developed and a pleasure to read.  There are certain authors whose books I will purchase and read without knowing what the stories are about.  After reading her two books, Gerri Hill goes on that list.  She ought to be on your list, too.	2004-07-10

Just like I'm not sure that a young woman today can really understand what's going on in the recent Julia Roberts movie, &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;, about women in the 1950s.  Sometimes you just have to have lived through something to &quot;get&quot; it.  As someone who was first discovering her lesbianism during the period this book is set in, I understand the forces tugging on Carol and the decision she has to make.  If anything, I think Winters made the decision too easy.  It sure wasn't as readily accepted as this book would indicate, especially in a period when women were just winning some positions in society where &quot;deviant&quot; attitudes would not be tolerated.  Many of us who wanted to make a difference were forced by circumstances to adopt attitudes and behaviors that kept us closeted for many years to come.  The book captures some of that, but you have to understand it's historical context to fully feel what is going on.  If you're a younger lesbian today and you want to understand why some of the older women you meet act like they do, read this book.	2004-06-27
US	50728990	R2TR4NRBDQ62J6	1414008503	83206754	Love Light	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Lose the adjectives	This is the third book by Corman that I have read and, as usual, she writes a really good story.  My only complaint is that she needs to lose all of the adjectives and learn how to write normal dialogue.  She can't write a sentence without telling you how lusciously beautiful and astonishing something is.  And her characters talk like that, too.  Everyone is &quot;amazingly beautiful&quot; and her characters don't mind saying that to each other.....constantly.  Once you wade through that, however, you find a good story.  You have two women, a doctor and a lawyer, who have both suffered terrible losses in their partners and are brought together by the illness of the lawyer's mother.  They are drawn to each other immediately, maybe a little too quickly, but you get to watch two women who have been hurt so badly by life get to find a chance to try again.  The quality of their lives seems almost too fantastic, but their love scenes are scorching.  There is a secret lurking however that can destroy their happiness and, once it is revealed, you wonder if they can overcome it.  All in all, this is a good book and worth reading.  Just try to skip over the adjectives.	2004-06-20

I read McCann's first book and reviewed it on here as being a good story, but she was too over the top with phrases like \\"beautiful lover\\" in every other sentence.  The first book wasn't terrible though, so I decided to give this one a try.  Same thing again.  You have two women who fall in love with each other the minute they say hello, despite the fact that each of them has supposedly been badly hurt in previous relationships.  After spending one day together, one of them is ready to quit her job, sell her home and move hundreds of miles away from family and friends and the other woman can't wait for it to happen.  The second woman even starts remodeling her house while the first one goes home to move.  And once again, we're stuck with the \\"beautiful lover\\" phrase.  McCann always has the basis for a good story, but she doesn't allow it to develop.  Nothing ever builds, it just happens right away.  She does write in plenty of sex scenes though.  Her characters are having mind shattering, soul rendering, multiple orgasmic sex every time they're alone.  Sorry, McCann must be rubbing off on me.  Let's see, two women who are both devastingly beautiful, fall in love instantly, constantly tell each other how beautiful they are and how much they love each other and the sex gets so much better each time that it's only because they're characters in a book that they don't kill each other.  Yep, sounds real to me.  Oh, and let's not forget the adorable children who instantly fall in love with the new lover, too.  I think I'll pass on any more McCann books.  I don't want to go diabetic.	2004-04-16

I was going to say the story is OK, but it isn't.  The dialogue is stilted and uncomfortable.  The characters are unbelieveable and, if they had said they loved each other one more time in an unrealistic way, I was thinking about setting the book on fire.  The situations are worse than the characters.  The only thing I can think of that is comparable to this book is a soap opera, a very bad soap opera.  You won't believe the situations these people find themselves in or how they are resolved.  The only good thing about this book is that it has lots of sex.  Lots of hot sex.  In fact, that's what the author is best at writing, but you can tell she let her fantasies run wild with some of these scenes.  And when will people stop writing books about lesbians who can't seem to meet any woman without having sex with her?  So, if you want a well written book, this isn't it.  If you want to read sex scenes that will definitely turn you on, then this is the book, but at least you know why you're buying it.	2004-02-29

Actually, the book is good SHORT reading and that's the point.  The book is only 180+ pages long and there isn't a lot of character development.  If you're looking for short escapism, McNab will never disappoint you, but her books are just too short and don't contain enough story in them.  Now that the market in lesbian literature is expanding, she's dropping into the second tier of authors.

It's about the world, sometime probably in the 2020s, that has gone through some sort of world war, not between countries, but opposing forces that cross national boundaries.  If this sounds vague, the book is too.  That's the only reason for four stars instead of five.  The book leaves a lot of questions that aren't answered and therefore makes following some of the story difficult.  Benton Basilis, war veteran, explosives expert and historian of the Amazon Nation finds that she has inherited half a house in the center of the Amazon Nation from a decidedly different cousin.  As she has just been made homeless and jobless, she decides to journey to the Nation and take a chance.  She meets a host of characters there, all women, of course, who are zany beyond belief.  This is a fun read, but you'll need to stay on top of it to keep the story lines straight.	2003-11-28

Let me say up front that, the major flaw in the book is that the lead character, who is supposed to be so world wise and efficient as a trained assassin, is just a little too naive about sex and relationships.  She falls in love too fast, but it doesn't really detract from the story that much. This is one of those books that you don't want to put down to do your real work and, if you save it for bedtime reading, it's gotten much later than you thought when you're ready to go to sleep.  The story is very engrossing and the ending is perfect. The intimate scenes are a little underdeveloped, but let your imagination have lots of fun.  This is one you'll enjoy.	2003-10-25

It's a nice story about a woman coming to the realization of what she wants in life, namely a relationship with another woman and not her husband, and the younger woman who is waiting for the older woman to understand herself.  It also needed an editor badly.  This is partially a problem with the publisher she chose. First Books is a very small concern and is infamous for doing very little to polish its authors' books.  There are numerous misspelled or misused words in this book and the same words and ideas are repeated too often.  A good editor would have straightened out a lot of this.  If you can put that aside though, and sometimes it's not easy, you can enjoy the story.  And there is a somewhat humorous twist to the story.  What is more humorous than two women who are trying to decide whether to accept or reject each other being stuck in the same house, in the same bed?  It certainly is an interesting situation.	2003-09-28

Basically, you have a woman who is trying to hide on an island while she tries to assess her life and what she should do with it in the face of potentially devastating news.  She thinks she has no future.  And she meets another woman who is living on the island, but it is an empty life that appears to have little purpose.  Neither one is looking for love, but they find themselves drawn together. If they acknowledge their love, can they face an uncertain future together?  Find out.	2003-08-24

It's about a group of women who have been friends for a long time and the tangled personal relationships they are in.  Blair is the love 'em and leave 'em type who says she likes her freedom, but can't admit that she can't find anyone to fill the hole in her emotions, especially the one her mother left when she rejected Blair for her lifestyle.  Natalie and Annie serve as the model for the group with their ten year marriage, except that Natalie, who is about to turn 40, thinks she's living a lie. And Leah is determined to find the same kind of relationship, no matter how many women she has to date.  The book traces their interactions and how they try to find out what they want in all of these relationships.	2003-08-10
US	50728990	R3OXEBA40ZWQOQ	0941483819	965865556	Passion's Legacy	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	Victorian romance	This story is set right at the beginning of the Victorian era in England and concerns a group of women who are trying to lead unconventional lives in a period that only allows a woman a very conventional role.  It opens with Sarah discovering, after twenty-two years of thinking rather highly of herself, that she is the illegitimate daughter of her uncle's dead sister.  Suddenly, her prospects in this society are very different and it causes her to flee her uncle's home to find someplace where she can figure out what to do about this.  Along the way, she is rescued at a tavern by Lady Augusta Pym and invited to visit with her on her estate.  Sarah quickly develops an attraction for Augusta which she doesn't immediately understand, but which becomes clearer as she learns more about Augusta, the life she has led and her unusual group of friends.  If you like Jane Austen's books, this is rather like a lesbian coming of age story set in one of her backgrounds.  It's pleasant and quick reading.	2003-08-10

And to lable one party or the other as traitors only indicates what an idealogue this woman is.  When did it become acceptable in the US to label people enemies of the country because they disagree with you?  Coulter would spend her time more productively if she would stop writing inflamatory, half true books and spent some time researching what political debate in this country is supposed to be about and how important it is.  Conservatives are always talking about what the Founding Fathers intended.  Coulter writes as if she forgot to check out their ideas.  At a time when they could have dictated one party, they deliberately refused to do so. Tyranny by either party is unacceptable.  Coulter proves to be a true disciple of McCarthy with her tactics.  Despite her ranting, I doubt that any &quot;true&quot; American would want to return to those days.  Hysteria on the right is no more attractive than hysteria on the left.	2003-07-01

Not only is it well written, but it has a nice surprise.  There is a great deal of humor in this book that will have you laughing out loud, which is not something I normally do.  The main characters, BJ and Hobie, are very real: stubborn, hot tempered, compassionate, worried about commitment and big klutzes. You keep turning the pages because you don't know if they're going to finally realize how much they love each other or kill each other.  Sometimes quite literally.  Hobie has a really unfortunate habit of hitting people with her car.  Along the way you learn about a magical island and the people who inhabit it, including two elderly lesbians who have been telling friends for years that they are sisters.  And one of the sisters has a three foot tall invisible hamster that has to be respected.  And then there's the witches, excuse me, Wiccan coven that all of the finest ladies on the island belong to.  The book is fast-paced and very enjoyable.  Are these two meant to be together?  As one character Rebecca says, she just deals the Tarot cards, Fate takes care of the rest, but maybe with a little help.  You'll like this book.	2003-06-05

As usual, this is a terrific book with excitement, suspense and plenty of romance.  It picks up the story from Shield of Justice and continues the relationship between Sgt. Rebecca Frye and Dr. Catherine Rawlings as they are drawn into a special task force that is trying to stop a child pornography ring.  Since the ring functions online, there is a special treat in that computer ace Sloan and her partner Michael from Radclyffe's previous book, A Matter of Trust, are introduced into the story.  The story is not resolved completely at the end, so one can only hope that there is another book in this series.  Buy this.  You will not be disappointed.	2003-06-01

The mistakes in verb tenses and grammar and the infantile dialogue are enough to drive you crazy. Within one paragraph, Chatelain has a character talking to herself because she keeps using the wrong name in the wrong places.  A good editor would pick up these problems and make this a stronger book.  If these women are true to life, I'm glad I'm not leading that life.  One woman is infuriated when she walks in on her girlfriend in bed with another woman, despite the fact that she has just cheated herself.  For two women who are supposed to be so committed to each other, they have the morals of alley cats.  There are side incidents that have nothing to do with the story and do nothing to further or enhance it. The way these women talk is so stilted you wonder where they came from, certainly not modern Earth.  There are some powerful sex scenes.  Maybe those make up for the shortcomings of the book, barely.  The nutty thing is that I'll probably read volume 3, which is pending, just to find out how the story ends up.....and to see if Chatelain finally gets a good editor, because she sure needs one.	2003-03-29
US	50728990	R24T2QAMLZH6FG	0971681252	673630720	Paradise Found	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Be tolerant of the language	You need to be able to put up with a certain type of simplistic writing to get through this book.  That's unfortunate because it's not a bad story.  Bly and Jordan are very engaging and the story develops fairly well, but it often reads like a Harlequin Romance.  Just how often can you stomach each of them calling the other one her \\"beautiful lover\\" and their constant professions of love for each other?  The conflict with another character Cindy is stretched and there's an unbelieveable development with Jordan's family, but you can wade through it.  The family members and friends involved with these two are unusually accepting and happy that the women are gay, but I suppose those situations exist.  The sex scenes are steamy and make the book.  This is probably a first attempt by the writers.  A good story would have benefitted from the help of a skillful editor.  However, if you want to ready an easy book, with a good story that will reward your libido, this is the one for you.	2002-12-28

Witnesses against this man have a habit of turning up dead.  To Alex, protecting the witness is not only her duty as a police officer, but a matter of personal revenge.  Her twin sister Anna had been mistakenly blown up by members of the crime syndicate when she borrowed Alex's car.  Alex decides the safest place to be is a remote cabin in the mountains that she and her sister had many years before.  Alex has two surprises waiting for her.  When they're almost at the cabin, she discovers that the witness has had a secret tracking device planted on him, so their location is no longer secret.  Then, when they get to the cabin, she finds Rhonda, and old childhood friend and the woman Alex loves more than anyone, waiting for them.  Rhonda has always had psychic connections to Alex and she sees trouble coming.  The rest of the book deals with two objectives.  Can Alex and Rhonda keep the witness alive long enough to testify before the grand jury and, in the process, will they finally realize what they mean to each other?<br />This is a first novel by Sam Ruskin and it shows.  There are areas that need more plot development and the characters could use more fleshing out, but it's a pleasant read for an afternoon.	2002-08-25

For some reason, the author is choosing to release the stories out of chronolical sequence, which can be a little disconcerting.  If you're already read the second book that came out, this one goes back in time.  Jame has just been appointed to her first position as a Special Arbiter and Tigh is still being closely watched to see if she can be trusted not to revert to the ruthless behavior that made her a war hero and the most feared person in her country.  They travel to a town called Maymi that is hosting a most unusual carnival and is in the grips of an underworld syndicate.  In the course of trying to bring justice to this town, the partners become involved in attempted assassinations, kidnap plots and twice have to defeat an invading army of the Silver Dragon.  This edition is told in the same style of the previous books, but, if you've read the whole series, you will need to suppress the knowledge from volume 2 because it hasn't happened yet.  If you like fantasy fiction, you'll find this a pleasant read.	2002-08-20

You have a central character, Amy, who has left her husband and children after twenty-four years of a rather mundane marriage to enter a lesbian relationship with a slightly younger woman, Deb.  Amy's husband is confused, her children are angry, Deb isn't as faithful as she should be and Amy's business is failing while she tries to figure out how to make all of this work.  There are a lot of secondary characters, gay and straight, who add to the plot and complicate it.  There's plenty of conflict and humor and healthy dashes of romance.  The question is, how will all of the questions be resolved at the end of the book?  It's a pleasant read.	2002-08-16

The story is more detailed and develops over a period of months.  This allows the characters to present themselves more fully and the outcome of the book isn't obvious from the beginning.  At one point you will wonder how exactly is Danny going to figure out her situation with Maureen, Kara and Chris.  And how long can she keep her numerous \\"evenings out\\" and what's really going on during them secret from her mother and daughter.  It's a pleasant short read, full of sexy passages, and not a bad way to spend an afternoon.	2002-08-14

There is much more character and plot development than you typically find in a Calhoun book.  Her central figures are Kate and Pat.  Kate arrives at the family lake home running from a failed marriage of 24 years.  Somehow, without her noticing, her husband has fallen in love with a much younger woman.  Kate doesn't know what else to do but get away.  At the lake she meets Pat, who is in the midst of a crumbling relationship of her own.  They start out as good friends who enjoy sailing, swimming and just talking about things.  This book covers a time span of almost two years, so you get a real chance to see things develop.  Kate is trying to define her relationships with a number of people - her grown children, her estranged brother who returns to her life just in time to discover he's dying of AIDS, the mortician who wants to marry her, her dead parents, but most of all Pat.  You get a good, but little less clear picture of Pat who is also trying to figure out where she went wrong in her relationship with Gail, but more importantly is trying to understand the pull she is feeling towards Kate.  It's a well developed story and gives some very real glimpses of what just plain every day life is like when everything seems to be falling apart around you.  If you like Calhoun's work, you'll really like this one.	2002-08-05

Two women meet, face challenges and try to see if they can form a relationship out of that.  Shelley inherits a lakeside resort from an uncle she hardly knew.  Living by the lake, enjoying the natural beauty, immediately appeals to her, but not to her partner Jan, who wants to stay in the city.  Shelley already deals with regrets over breaking up her marriage, which has caused her to be estranged from her only child.  Can she be responsible for this relationship failing also or can she and Jan find a way to salvage what they have?  At the lake they meet Emily, who stumbles up to their cabin after running her car into a tree.  Emily has moved back home with mother after her lover cleans out their bank account and leaves.  Can she just be friends with these women despite the attraction she feels for Shelley?  And just to complicate matters, someone is terrifying Shelley by coming on to her land to destroy things.  One of the different aspects of this novel is that the major characters are people in their 40s, not the energetic, nubile young women who usually populate lesbian novels.  It's interesting to see mature women dealing with mature problems for a change.	2002-08-02

Her main character Lori comes from a difficult family and, while a recognized athlete in her high school, she finds it difficult to make friends and to feel like she's part of the group.  She wishes she was more like the most popular girl in school Julie.  The only bright light she sees in her life is that her parents are going to let her spend the summer away at a girls' camp.  She sees it as a chance for an adventure, plus an escape from her domineering stepmother.  Imagine Lori's surprise when Julie not only shows up at camp, but is staying in the same cabin.  The rest of the summer unfolds in a wonderful story.  We'll learn that Lori is really a natural leader and someone the other girls look up to for her ability to make everyone shine and feel comfortable.  She meets a wonderful cast of supporting characters in the other girls who attend the camp.  There are a number of funny and exciting events in the book.  The main theme of the book is Lori's gradual awakening of sexuality, any sexuality.  You will learn that she's never had a date, never been kissed and hasn't missed any of it....until this summer.  For those of us who stumbled our way through it, it's poignant to read as Lori begins to realize that something is changing about her and she's getting \\"tinglings\\" she doesn't understand.  Some of her revelations are funny (you'll love her definition of puberty) and some will make you cringe as you remember your own young self dealing with similar thoughts and feelings.  As Lori's interest turns more to Julie, you'll share her confusion about whether she likes girls (she doesn't even know what the word for that is)or is it just because she's never been with a boy.  Julie also blossoms in this novel, first in discovering that she needs to reevaluate how she judges people and then in her feelings for Lori.  The story does not finish with this book and ends on a painful note.  Kelli has indicated that another one is coming soon.  It can't come too soon to see how these young women settle their story.	2002-07-29

Her students tell her so and the sports teams she coaches respond to her leadership.  Then the letter arrives.  The letter is sent to every faculty member, the administration and the school board.  The letter says that Alex is unfit to teach high school students because she is living with another woman and her child in an active lesbian relationship.  If you're Alex, you think the worst has happened, but you're wrong.  As you're trying to deal with the letter, your lover Sue is notified by her ex-husband that he is going to try and take her daughter away because of the relationship.  Then the home of a friend is burned down and the boy Alex has been trying to help may be responsible.  This book covers a lot of areas in a few pages.  What are the costs of staying in the closet?  Can teachers be deprived of their professions because of their lifestyles?  Can Alex and Sue find a way to keep their relationship alive in the face of all of these pressures?  And who keeps trying to burn out their friend?  Surprisingly, the book carries a punch even with dealing with all of those topics.	2002-07-27

There is an elite ruling class that enjoys a privileged lifestyle thanks to the work provided by a hereditary class of slaves.  The privileged don't question the benefits that come to their lives and the slaves are treated like animals.  Roslin is the daughter of the ruling lord and has never questioned the order of things until there is an uprising and she meets Brice, the leader of the slave rebellion, the prophesized Chosen One.  Brice challenges almost every concept Ryshta society is founded on.  There should not be a privileged class, but everyone should work together for the greater good.  Government leaders should be chosen democratically and that includes women having an equal voice with men.  First afraid, Roslin finds herself drawn to the enigmatic Brice and eventually embracing these stimulating new ideas, as much as she would like to embrace Brice.  But, there is a secret.  Unlike everyone thinks, Brice is a woman raised by her parents as a male so that she can avoid the forced period of bed slavery required of the slave women.  How will this impact on Roslin's growing feelings for him/her?  What will happen if the people discover that their longed for champion is a woman?  It's a fast paced story with just enough adventure and romance.  It raises questions about the roles of people in society, but you don't feel like you've been hit over the head with them at the end of the book.  Very enjoyable and a fast read.	2002-07-24

Mickey has left a loveless marriage that met everyone else's definition of success in America.  Then she discovers she is really a lesbian, which costs her custody of her only child.  When the book opens, she finds herself middle aged, successful at her job and living a life that, while not exciting, is at least comfortable.  Then she meets Angela, twenty years younger and a star of the local news broadcast.  Mickey KNOWS they should not get together.  Everyone who knows these two women seems to KNOW they should not get together.  Angela is determined to have Mickey though and as she works her spell, Mickey finds herself being drawn in like a moth to the flame.  This story involves drug and alcohol abuse and what it means to be an enabler.  As you read it, you'll see that disaster is where this relationship is headed , but Mickey, who is usually very level headed and seeks help from a therapist, can't seem to save herself from what is happening.  The book has a stunning ending, not surprising, but certainly not the one you're led to expect.  It's a good book and an excellently told story, but it can be difficult emotionally to read.  We've all known a Mickey.  Some of us have been Mickey and known our own Angelas.	2002-07-24

One of the nice things is that it's longer, so the characters and the story have a real chance to develop.  Don't let the length put you off though.  Because the story is so interesting, the pages fly by.  You meet Marika and Rhiannon, two women from very different positions in life who share a common trait.  Because of the psychological wounds they suffered growing up, neither one of them believes that they are capable of finding or being loved.  Another nice trait in this book is that, for those of you who've read a lot of recent lesbian literature, these characters are not Xena makeovers. No, tall dark blue-eyed beauty with a short blonde sidekick.  One is tall and the other shorter and that's about the end of the simularities.  As these two are drawn together through their work lives first, you will get to meet a rich assortment of supporting characters, including David, the Episcopal priest who is willing to accept that what Jesus taught about love and what the church says may not be the same thing, and Lee, the female private investigator, who will do anything to keep her family and friends safe.  And yes, there are bad guys in this story, but they make the story richer.  Events unfold as Rhi and Rika meet, slowly form a friendship, and are drawn into a sinister situation, while they realize slowly that they're becoming more than friends. The question that hangs over the book as events develop is if these two women, who have been so damaged by others, can let their defenses down enough to see the love that is available to each one. This is a great book.  You'll like it.	2002-07-19

It opens with the central character Ally Brent on her deathbed speaking to her daughter.  Then Ally begins to think about her life and the details are revealed in flashback.  Ally rose to be the first governor of her state and was an admired and respected politician, but it came with a price.  She's been trapped in a loveless marriage to protect her career and hide her long time affair with Clair.  The only good thing to come out of the marriage is her daughter, but things begin to fall apart.  Ally has a breakdown, has to resign as governor and then has to reassess the rest of her life.  Most of the events take place in the 1960s and early 1970s when attitudes towards gays and lesbians were even harder than today.  Chase does a good job of showing the compromises that Ally has had to make to have a successful career and the terrible cost she's paid also.  The book is easy to read and will keep your attention.  One of the plot points that will keep you reading is to find out just how big a creep Ally's husband Michael can become before she finally decides to stop putting up with his mess and live her life the way she really wants to.  Fortunately, by the end of the book everything comes together.  There's no suspense in this book.  Just an honest look at people's lives.	2002-07-18

It tells the story of Chloe Jones, a young American who signs on to be an au pair for a family in Paris for a year.  She's greeted at the airport by tall, dark, enigmatic Laurence Glairon, the oldest daughter in the family, who appears to be as happy to see Chloe as a toothache. Though Chloe is immediately captivated by young Clement, she will learn that this family contains some dark secrets.  She will also learn about herself as she and Laurence begin to slowly trust each other, form a friendship, and then discover that they both want more.  This book has a number of surprising plot twists that keep it interesting.  One little irritation is that, of course, many of the characters speak French and no translation is provided, but it doesn't detract from the flow of the story very much.  You'll find yourself drawn into this book and wanting to know the two central characters.  The author has a web site where she has provided the follow up story if you want to find out what eventually happens to these two.  It's full of twists also and hopefully is headed towards publication.	2002-07-16

Kyril comes to Earth to discover what the strange illness is that killed her lover on her home planet.  She is sure that it is something that was brought back from a previous visit.  She has also been infatuated with a woman she met on a previous trip, Kathryn, who is searching for a soul mate and has been fixated on Kyril for two years after a brief meeting in a lesbian bar.  What Kyril will quickly discover is that her deceased mate contracted AIDS.  This is a special threat to Kyril's homeworld since all of the people there are vampires.  It turns out that her people have been crossing the dimensional time line to live on Earth, and yes, occasionally feed off of its people, for centuries.  Kathryn ironically is an AIDS researcher who is trying to find the cause and cure of this epidemic on her own planet.  The book is about how these two join forces, become lovers and try to overcome some significant cultural differences to be with each other.  It's an interesting book, but not one for those who are looking for creatures of the night who are running around draining humans and sleeping in coffins during the day.  It's sort of a blend of scifi, vampirism, lesbian romance, coming together of different cultures and social awareness lecture all in one book.  It's a good first novel for Crozier and the ending is open ended enough that, if she wants to, she could pick up this pair in a later book.	2002-07-12

Cynthia is slowly coming out of the grief over the death of her partner Kitty when she meets two fascinating women, Sophia and Greta.  This book contains mystery, intrigue, suspense, possible terrorist connections, murder attempts and two passionate love affairs.  The problem is that all of this supposedly happens in just two days.  Cynthia meets Sophia first, sleeps with her and decides she's met her next great love. Then she meets Greta and decides she's met her soul mate.  I'm always a little nervous about people who meet someone and fall passionately in love after a few minutes.  Maybe things are different in the jet set, which all of these ladies conveniently belong to.  I suspect, since this is Lattimore's first novel, that she just didn't know how to develop her story better.  It's a good story, but it could have used more detail and development to make it more believeable.	2002-07-10

It's a compact little novel that combines a lot of themes - murder mystery, May/December romance, a woman coming out in midlife, gay and lesbian life in a small town.  With that many topics, it would be easy to loose track of the story, but that doesn't happen.  The story deals with Kate and Nikki, their attraction for each other, and how a murder mystery that has the whole town buzzing helps to finally draw them together.  Kate, the older woman, is a major player in the small town's politics and is more cautious in her approach to everything except her attraction to Nikki. She finally feels that all of the pieces are slipping into place with her love for Nikki and doesn't see why anyone else should care.  Nikki, a known member of the town's lesbian community, can't wait to solve the crime that Kate has unintentionally witnessed, especialy as it draws her together with this fascinating older woman. Her caution shows up in dealing with the relationship because she knows the problems of dealing with an alternative lifestyle in a small town.  She doesn't want to hurt Kate and she doesn't want to be hurt herself.  Tying all of this together is the mystery.  Who is killing prominent business people and burning down parts of the town and why does this person keep targeting Nikki?  It's a good mystery.  It's a good story.  It probably could have been longer to deal more thoroughly with all of the themes, but then it would have bogged down.  Give it a try.  I think you'll like it.	2002-07-05
US	50728990	R2WI9KZIIWE31B	1930928254	726106482	Full Circle	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Getting better	This is the third installment in the series that Brooks is writing about Eva and Zoe.  So far, she has three or four more planned after this one.  The series started when Eva and Zoe met during World War II in Greece.  Zoe worked for the Greek resistance and Eva, who was supposed to be the enemy daughter of a Nazi officer, turned out to be helping the resistance.  The women fall in love and find themselves transplanted in Australia after the war.  This book picks up the story about five years after the war when they are building their careers and planning for the future.  This is probably best described as a transition novel.  It wraps up some of the unanswered questions from the previous books and sets the groundwork for the ones to come.  Brooks' writing is getting tighter and better as she tells her story.  No one book in the series stands out as a masterpiece, but together they weave a story that you are drawn into.  By the time you get to Full Circle, you feel you know Eva and Zoe well and you want to know how they're going to work things out.  Part of the interest in the story is that it is set (now) in the 1950s when it was certainly even more difficult to be gay or lesbian.  One suspects Brooks makes their families and friends just a little too accepting of their relationship, but its good to see them struggle against and overcome the odds.  Unlike the books that were actually written in the 1950s, you see two women who are happy with their situation and not constantly suicidal.  There are a lot of flashback scenes in this one to keep you up with the story development, but you'll enjoy it more if you've actually read the previous books.  A big plus for this book is that Brooks is getting much better at writing romantic scenes.	2002-06-19

This one is based in the Himalayas.  Ricki is a world ranked mountaineer, who spends most of her life climbing one mountain after another.  The problem is that she doesn't make much money from it, so she's hired herself on as a guide to a group that wants to climb Mt. Everest.  Allison is a high powered dealer from the NY financial markets who likes to live on the edge.  She takes two months off from her job to climb Everest and, in the process, sort out some things from her life.  The book gives a really interesting view of what it takes to complete a feat like this.  Sports shows make it look like you go to the mountain, you climb straight up and see if you can make the top.  It turns out it's much more complicated and time consuming than that.  The group that the women are traveling with includes several others and it's interesting to see them interact.  It's also interesting to see how Ricki and Allison go from practically despising each other at first glance to falling in love.  The only criticism is that the romantic scenes could have been developed a lot more, but it's still a terrific story, especially the ending.	2002-06-15

I'm beginning to believe this woman can't write a bad book.  This one takes you to the frontier days of Montana.  Kate Beecher has moved west with her parents from Boston to start a new life.  Kate and her father share a love of new experiences and places, while Mrs. Beecher responds to the world of a typical woman of her time.  Her husband makes the decisions and she'll follow along.  This is exactly the world that Kate wants to get away from.  She's never felt completely comfortable in the society of Boston, but Montana feels like home and she embraces the new surroundings.  Then she meets Jessie Forbes.  Could anyone be more different than the women Kate knew in Boston?  In a country that puts women in laces and corsets, here is a woman who wears pants, herds horses and wears a pistol on her hip.  Kate and Jessie are immediately drawn to each other, though neither one understands the attraction at first.  One of the nice things about Radclyffe's books is that her characters don't immediately fall in love and jump into bed.  Relationships develop at a normal pace and face real problems.  Though the relationship between the two women is accepted a little more quickly than would have probably really happened in the 1800s, it was the West, where anything was possible.  Readers will enjoy this story of two women who, against great odds, find each other and then, against even greater odds, love each other.	2002-06-12
US	50728990	R3RO8ASGYGPF4Z	1930928246	1605650	Retribution	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Excellent book	Retribution is the second volume in a trilogy by Susanne Beck about Ice and Angel, two women who meet in prison and have to face unbelieveable odds to make a life for themselves.  As Retribution opens, they are crossing the border into Canada, fleeing from both the law and the Mafia.  Angel has been granted a pardon from prison, but Ice has escaped to join her and she is the target everyone is after.  This book deals with them building a home in Canada and establishing themselves as valued members of their small community.  Always hanging in the background though is the threat of Ice's past catching up to them.  As this book ends, everything seems to come crashing down around them, but you're left with the hint that even that may not be so. Beck creates amazing characters in her books.  I find myself thinking at various times that these, and the supporting characters, are fantastic women, the kind you would like to know, then have to remind myself that they are characters in a book.  You can read any one of the three books by itself, but you won't get the full picture unless you read all three, which I strongly recommend.  Beck also knows how to write wonderfully erotic love scenes without becoming trite or crude.  If you like to read about strong women who overcome great odds, these are the books for you.	2002-04-06
US	50728990	R3MRWCYFFDVSQR	0967768756	525331594	Redemption	Books	5	22	22	N	N	Terrific beginning to a series	I have to admit that I've gone back to write this after finishing all three books in this trilogy, but that's because Beck has managed to write such a compeling series that it made me want to write a review.  Redemption is about two women who meet in prison, the only real resemblance to The Shawshank Redemption that another reviewer mentioned.  Angel is in the Bog for killing her husband.  She doesn't deny doing the crime, although he was in the process of raping and abusing her when it happened and she only intended to \\"stop\\" him with the bat.  She comes into contact with an amazing cast of characters, from Corinne the librarian, known as the \\"Black Widow\\" for the several husbands she quite joyfully murdered, and the Amazons, a group of women who live by a code of honor and try to keep the peace in the prison between the gangs and the guards.  Then one day, the founder of the Amazons is brought back to the prison.  Ice is an amazing collection of characteristics.  Raised by artistic parents until their untimely deaths, she has been turned by life into a cold blooded killer with a highly developed sense of honor.  She can snap your neck with the same talent that she uses to cultivate bonzai trees.  Prison life runs in her veins while she reads books in the original Chinese and Russian.  She is feared, admired and worshipped by convicts and guards alike.  Framed for a murder she did not commit, Ice has allowed herself to be convicted because of the murders she has committed and can't be convicted for.  Ice has to be one of the most complex characters created in modern literature.  And she and Angel love each other with a passion that is frequently breathless.  Beck has a real ability for writing erotic love scenes that are realistic and not crude.  The book is a fascinating vision of prison life, not something that I originally thought I would find interesting.  You can read just this book for a terrific story, but the entire trilogy (Retribution and Restitution arethe other volumes) tells a compelling story.  These characters seem like real people.  You'll wish they were just so you could meet them.	2002-04-06

Angel and Ice met in the first book, Redemption, when they were both in prison; tried to build a life in the second book, Retribution; and try to pick up the pieces in this last book.  Ice has been captured by the authorities who are willing to work a deal.  If she will use her skills as a former hit woman for the Mafia to bring in the man who originally set her up for the murder that sent her to prison, all of the charges will be dropped against her.  If she doesn't agree to this, she will go back to prison and the authorities will prosecute Angel for helping Ice to hide in Canada.  Talk about being between a rock and a hard place.  Retribution is about how Ice goes about this task, trying to keep Angel safe in the meantime.  Beck reintroduces several characters from the first book, friends of both women from prison, who come to help Ice with her problem.  There is just the right blend of humor, adventure and cliff-hanging to make this book work.  Beck once again has created very vivid and realistic characters.  Women who want to step out of the pages of the book and actually breathe.  Yes, this is another in the long line of Uber Xena books, but these characters have an edginess and strength that is often missing in the other books. And Beck hasn't lost her touch with writing love scenes either.  All of these books will definitely keep you \\"interested\\".  The best part is that they're just plain well written.  You'll need to read all three to see the whole story, but you won't regret that.	2002-04-06

A little girl is kidnapped, you know who did it, why and where she is.  The story is in the question of whether or not Tenny will be able to get her back.  To make it interesting, the child is the daughter of Tenny's former lover, the only woman she will probably ever love, but they can't seem to work things out. Could solving this case help?  There are some aspects of the plot that are pretty unbelieveable.  This kidnapping is connected to a kidnapping Tenny couldn't solve four years before, in a different city.  And Tenny figures out pretty quickly that one of the kidnappers is a doctor who treated her in an accident.  It's pleasant reading though, especially if you're looking for something that doesn't take too much effort.	2002-03-21
US	50728990	R39HI1TF9JIRWS	1560232234	831259559	To the Edge	Books	5	25	26	N	Y	Excellent book	Cameron Abbott has scored big with what is apparently her first novel.  She develops her characters well and doesn't rush her story.  The scenes develop at a believeable pace and there is always just enough uncertainty that you can't be sure where the story is going.  The story is told in two parts.  First, it's the 1970s and you meet Anne Henderson at college.  She's a star in the college theater group, but that's small consolation in her private life.  She thinks she's in love with a friend from high school, Gallagher Davenport, who is straight, so that appears to be hopeless. Anne has dismissed her feelings as just strong bonds of friendship and has followed convention by having a boyfried.  Something is missing though.  Instead, Anne finds herself being drawn in by the fascinating Rae Sheldon.  Rae will entice her, love her and betray her.  Then the book flips to twenty years later.  Anne is a high powered lawyer in a New York firm and just as she's involved in an important case, both Gallagher and Rae show up in her life.  Anne's attraction to Gallagher is still strong and though she's willing to settle for friendship, Gallagher seems to be indicating she wants something more.  Anne's just as determined to stay away from Rae, who won't leave her alone.  Meanwhile, there is a summer intern at the law firm who is definitely trying to put the moves on Anne AND her case appears to be headed for disaster. There are enough twists and turns in this plot to keep you wondering how it will turn out, literally until the last pages. I read the whole book in a few hours.  Great work.	2002-03-17
US	50728990	R3LA3ETGPNBQDZ	1930928238	959673458	Glass Houses	Books	4	3	5	N	Y	Actually, 4 1/2 stars	Ciaran Leavitt creates one heck of a book with an interesting premise. She takes a real book, Melissa Good's Tropical Storm, and makes her plot about the director and actress who are making the book into a movie. Jae is hoping to make her Hollywood career by taking over the movie that was begun by her mentor, a director who has just died of a drug overdose. Reed is hoping to resurrect a career almost destroyed by the same director by starring in a film she isn't comfortable with, but was manipulated into because the dead director knew about her past.  What makes this book really interesting is that the two major characters aren't madly in love by the end of the first chapter.  This book spends a lot of time showing how Jae is trying to save a movie she believes in and develop a trusting relationship with an actress who is known as the Amazon Ice Queen.  Reed's story is equally interesting as it gradually unfolds with the dark secrets she keeps and why she keeps them.  You get a feeling of reality as the characters move towards each other, stumble, move away, then find ways to salvage what is first an important friendship and then something more. It's refreshing to see two characters who decide that there are more important things than sex and that working at a difficult relationship can be worth the pain and trouble. Also, unlike many of these Uber Xena books, the \\"tall dark character\\" isn't perfect and the \\"gregarious blonde\\" isn't always bright and shiny. Both Jae and Reed show a range of emotions that is often missing in other books of this genre. The only reason I subtracted 1/2 a star is that, when they have finally overcome their own hesitations and a number of problems and the love scene finally comes, everything is \\"off camera\\". The problem with the Uber Xena writers is that many of them write excellent stories, but can't or won't do a passionate love scene. Maybe they're trying to stay too true to the TV characters. That's just one flaw however in what is areally engrossing book. Once I started reading it, I went straight through the 481 pages. There are just the right touches of humor, seriousness and emotion to make this worthwhile reading.	2002-03-16

Tony (Xena) is a FBI agent with a dark past and Megan (Gabrielle) is an Assistant Coroner.  They are brought together by a serial murder case that eventually has closer ties to Megan than they realize.  In the process of solving the case, they save each other's lives and develop a relationship.  This is actually two books in one.  The second book concerns Tony being threatened when she uncovers corruption within the FBI.  Both stories are well developed and hold your interest.  There are a lot of the predictable comments about the \\"tall, dark beautiful woman\\" and her \\"blonde gregarious lover\\".  The passion between them is alluded to and the reader is given the lead in scenes, but there is no explicit love scene in either book.  Interesting stories, pleasant read.	2002-03-14

The characters and the action in this book are developed much better than the first two books and she weaves several different plots into a more complex book.  Dar and Kerry face problems at work and at home.  A member of the board of directors is intent on driving them both from the company; meanwhile, Kerry's father is called to answer charges before Congress and Dar has a chance to bring her parents back together.  Add an attempt on Dar's life and an explosion that demolishes a hospital they are visiting in, and this book has plenty of action.  Now, if Good would just write a good love scene between her stars, this book would be perfect.	2002-03-12
US	50728990	R2I7W91DWUH0ON	0941483681	855832101	Black Iris	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Needed to be longer	This is a book that needed more pages.  Too much action is crammed in and dealt with too quickly.  What could be a plausible story loses its punch because the story line can't develop fully.  Caroline Jordan is a college professor who thinks she has recovered from a rape many years before, only to discover that the rapist is back in her life.  She becomes determined to hunt him down and stop him, with the help of her gay and lesbian friends in Denver.  Her lover Jane Sellers has been with her for years and appears willing to accept a relationship where she and Caroline profess deep love, but Caroline won't stop having affairs with other women.  This gives the book two really strong story lines to develop, but there isn't enough room for that.  The consequence is a good story that produces a lot of questions and has too many coincidences.  It's a short, fast-paced read though and worth the time.	2002-03-09

Delia Ironfoot is a part Native American, former archeologist, with a troubled past that has caused her to retreat from most of the world.  Enter Beth, a stock broker from Chicago, who insists she wants a guide to go backpacking, but can't hide the fact that she has another reason for this trip.  As they get to know each other, their relationship develops only to be threatened by circumstances they had no idea existed.  This is a nice, neat little book.  Enjoyable reading for an evening.	2002-03-08
US	50728990	R2MO6BC9B4QPPT	0967768772	336350194	The Deal	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Best of the genre	Don't let the fact that this book is another in the Xena genre put you off.  Unlike so many of those books, you're not constantly reminded of the physical comparison and these people seem more true to life.  They have to overcome real problems and they do it in a realistic manner, not everything comes out in their favor.  Kaz is a particularly interesting character.  Not everyone gets to the age of 30 and knows everything about life, terribly realistic.  You can feel for Chris also as she tries to figure out this complex woman and has to readjust her own perceptions and behaviors to a woman who takes many things at face value because she has no other point of reference. My only complaint is that the type should have been a little bigger, but part of that is because I read it in one night, so it was a little hard on the eyes.  Otherwise, this is a terrific book.	2002-03-06

I read a lot of lesbian literature and this ranks as one of the better ones produced in recent years.  It features another Xena couple, tall, dark and brooding and small, blonde and talkative, but the story is told so well, that it's not as distracting as in some of the books.  Lacey is the right hand &quot;man&quot; to a Mafia type boss and meets Rachel, who has a dark past herself.  The two books tell how they try to build a life together, solve mysteries and separate themselves from Lacey's criminal background.  The second book is actually the better one as far as plot and story development.  Unfortunately, I remember reading that the author died from cancer, so this is her only work, but she left behind a very good work.	2002-03-03

Dr. Kaitlin Bradley has taken a resort and turned it into a retreat for people who have suffered spinal cord injuries. You learn in the book that she has very personal reasons for being interested in such a project.  Nurse Sierra Vaughn had planned to spend her two week vacation in the Cayman Islands with her lover, until she found the lover in bed with another woman.  Instead, based on a friend's recommendation, Sierra decides to spend her two weeks helping out at the resort, Bradley Bay.  The rest of the book is about the instantaneous love affair that springs up between these two.  The story itself is good, but it is hard to believe that they fall in love - passionately - the moment they see each other.  The dialogue for the whole book is sophomoric, almost to the point of distraction.  If you could read the book, but avoid the conversations, it would be perfect, but that isn't possible.  Do people really say things like &quot;my precious lover&quot;, &quot;light of my life&quot;, and &quot;my beautiful woman&quot; anymore?  If they do, they certainly don't repeat them as often as the characters in the book.  Dialogue aside though, this is a good story with a lot of steamy love scenes, so read it and be ready to cringe when these people talk to each other.	2002-02-24

Now I understand why.  This isn't a work of fiction that is easy to read.  It makes you think while you're doing so.  Get past the story of a woman trying to cope with the death of her rock star mother, was it an accident or was it suicide?  Her lesbian talk show aunt and her own relationships are interesting, but the power of this book is in the ideas it provokes.  How can other people screw up your life and still be incredibly important and loving to you?  How long to you blame that person for the screw ups you create yourself?  How do you cope with and rise above jealousy when it's provoked by the success of someone you love dearly?  Once you've been terribly hurt, can you ever learn to trust someone again and then, how far should you trust them?  Noneof these are easy questions, but, in watching Nita Wild try to cope with them, maybe you see some answers for yourself.  So, if you're looking for a simple work of fiction with a good lesbian story and passionate sex scenes, this is not the book for you.  The story and the sex are there, but it's not simple.  It is however informative.	2002-02-23

Her style in Blue Holes is tighter than in Forces of Evil, which may be due to it being a shorter book.  She's getting better at love scenes, though she can use some improvement still.  She would save the best one for the last page of the book.  And there's a reference to a strange character at the end of this book that may indicate a third book about Dean and Katie.  If her writing improves as much in that one as it did for this book, the next one should be a real winner.  As it is, this is a nice tight, book with plenty of excitement and a better developed relationship.  If nothing else, you'll feel better thinking that there are people like this actually working in the government to keep us safe.  And if they aren't, they ought to be.	2002-02-18

The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 is the writer's style.  Kocialski tends to use simplistic dialogue and is repetitive in her words.  How many times does she have to remind us that her characters have emerald green and sapphire blue eyes? Apparently she doesn't know how to write a love scene either, instead settling for flowery references about soaring passion and sighs of ecstasy, but not allowing any of that heat to show between her characters.  The writing flaws are minor distractions however in what is overall a good read.	2002-02-17

Someone is threatening the safety of these societies, but no one is sure who the threat is.  The story develops at a quick pace, maybe a little too quick in some places, but it keeps you engaged as women establish relationships and try to save their people from disaster.  There's a character named Alaric who turns out to be especially interesting.  The book could use a little more development in some areas, but is an enjoyable read.  The nice thing about Herring is that, if you read her books in order, you see that her style is constantly improving.  She also knows how to write an enticing love scene without going too far over the edge.	2002-02-14

Then I wasn't sure if I liked it when I got to the end.  It's the story of two very different women.  Beth describes herself as a lesbian nomad.  She cut her ties years before and lives her life to the fullest, moving from place to place, leaving jobs and relationships before they get boring.  Her one constant is her music and her determination to live her life as honestly as she can.  Rita has been trapped in a fifteen year marriage to a man she never loved. She realizes this after a chance encounter on a beach with Beth.  Two things make this book an uneasy read.  Rita realizes in a matter of hours after just meeting and talking to Beth that she not only has never loved her husband, but she's been a lesbian all her life and is falling desperately in love with Beth.  In a matter of a few hours, Rita turns her life inside out and never has a second thought about it.  Beth meanwhile is constantly spouting philosophy about life, relationships, women and women, women and men, and anything else that comes up.  There's a good story in this book, but it often gets caught up in a philosophy lesson.  There is a hook at the end that will make you cry.  This isn't the book for an enjoyable afternoon read, but, if you're looking for one that will make you think about your life and the decisions you've made, this is it.  My copy of the book is signed by the author and she's written in the front, &quot;Believe in transformation&quot;.  You have to if you're going to read this book.	2002-01-28

As the title says, this is Part I and the story isn't finished.  Once you read this book though, you'll want to read the next installment.  The book is about Kris, a world famous stuntwoman, and Nicole, who is working as a gopher on a picture Nicole's uncle is helping to direct.  Nicole is kind,bubbly and willing to help everybody, which is why the quiet, withdrawn Kris is drawn to her.  Nicole has a dark secret in her private life though and it threatens any happiness she might have with Kris.  The book is well written and draws you in with the characters.  The ending definitely leaves you hanging though as you wonder if these two lovers can ever work things out.  The author has a web site where she has posted several stories about these two.  If you like the book, and you will, you might want to check out the site.	2002-01-26

The US finally elects a woman president and she's an out lesbian and single mother.  The thing is that the book makes it seem so plausible.  The story draws you in and wraps you around the characters.  You want to see what's going to happen on the next page and you care about what is happening to these two people.  The best thing is that there is a lot of humor in this book.  Some parts have to be read over just to enjoy the laughter.  Here's a hint, the president has a nightmare and the writer goes in to comfort her, then the president's mother finds them in bed together the next morning.  The dialogue will crack you up.  This is a good story, a tender romance and a great book.	2002-01-22

Calhoun creates one of the great mistakes in literature, you don't care about the characters at the end of the book.  Carly, who discovered her lebianism late in life, comes home to find her younger lover in bed with another woman.  She runs off to live in the family home at Tamarak Creek with her gay brother and meets the new neighbors, Serena, also a lesbian, and her abusive husband Jess.  Carly and Serena start an affair, threatened and made violent by Jess.  Reads like pretty powerful stuff.  The problem is that you can't develop any connection to the characters and there's no passion except when Jess is nearly killing one or both of the women.  It took me three days to plod through 204 pages.  For a contrast, read Love's Melody Lost by Radcliffe.  Ironically, it's only 187 pages, but, by the end of it, you really care about what is going to happen to the central characters.  Jackie Calhoun, who can be an excellent writer, should read that book to get herself back on track.	2002-01-20

I made the mistake of starting it at 2 AM, thinking I would read a few pages before going to sleep.  Four hours later I finally finished it.  If it had been longer, I never would have gone to sleep.  The great thing about this book is that, in a relatively few pages, you actually care about what is happening to these characters.  You feel Graham's pain and Anna's confusion and you want them to finally figure each other out.  I read this book right behind Jackie Calhoun's Tamarak Creek.  What a contrast!  At the end of Calhoun's work, I didn't like the characters, much less care about them.  With Radcliffe's book, you'll find yourself hoping for a sequel because you won't want to lose these characters.  This is the second novel by Radcliffe that I've read and she's been excellent both times.  Read this.  You'll like it.	2002-01-20

This is a story that stays with you.  As I've read more lesbian literature, I find myself often comparing those stories to this one.  There is something about this book that keeps drawing you back, to the stories and the characters.  I don't usually reread books, what's the point?  But I find that I can't let loose of this one.  Granted, some parts need work and it's another one in the tradition of the Xena stories, but, in the end, it just doesn't matter.  I've read all of Maas' books and this one is the best.  I don't know if I hope that she writes a sequel.  The first one is so good that a follow up might ruin it.  You'll like this book.	2002-01-12

The story is based in Native American Lakota culture before much contact with the white settlers takes place.

It's a classic story of two people who probably shouldn't get along finding they really have a lot in common.  As a historian, I have some problems, especially with the second story.  They mention the characters wearing pant suits and jeans.  Jeans weren't common for women in the 1940s, especially outside the US, and I'm not sure pant suits were even invented yet.  It's also difficult to believe that, once again, everyone who knows these two, except for the bad guys, of course, totally accepts their relationship.  Society just wasn't that accepting then.  And did lesbians even call each other &quot;wife&quot; yet?  It is a nice story, but don't read it expecting to find passionate sections.  Love scenes are handled very much like the old movies, everthing happens without the viewer seeing (or reading) anything.  If you don't mind that, you'll enjoy this story.	2002-01-04

In the best tradition of Tolkein, Davis creates a world of her own where some people can understand plants, some can totally relate to the emotions of others and a very few are gifted with the ability to talk to animals.  Davis introduces you to this world through the efforts of two Adepts.  Lorrah is a doctor who can feel the potential for medical cures in plants.  She is searching for a remarkable flower mentioned in a long forgotten journal that promises to cure many ailments.  She needs the help of Tate, who closely guards the secret that she is an even rarer Adept who can talk to and command animals.  The novel isn't very long, but contains a lot of adventure and romance.  If you like fantasy and a quick read, you'll love this book.  One can only hope that Davis will continue to tell more about this world in later books.	2002-01-04

Well, the title does say Book 1, but I wish authors wouldn't use this ploy to sell more books.  This story is strong enough to stand on its own.  The characters are engrossing, especially TJ Meridian.  How many novels do you read where the heroine starts out paralyzed?  It's a very reaffirming story though to believe that you can find love even if you suffer from a terrible handicap.  I think too many unknown relatives are popping up just to provide a story line, but the story itself is engaging.  You'll like this book, but you'll have to be prepared to buy the sequel when it comes out to get the end of the story.	2002-01-02

What do you do for a kind young woman who is caught in a terrible relationship and can only escape by reading Western novels and dreaming of living in those days?  Melia finds herself trapped in a world where she doesn't feel at ease and stuck with a relationship that is dangerous, but she can't seem to avoid.  After she's beaten up enough times, she convinces herself that relationships are meant to be that way for her.  Now, drop into her life Parker, a female outlaw from old Denver who falls through a rip in time and lands in Melia's office building.  Parker hides in the walkway above the ceiling and tries to make sense out of what has happened to her.  Fortunately, she chooses to hide above Melia's cubicle and, by observing her every day, comes to believe that Melia is someone she can trust to help her out of this situation.  If you're Melia, what do you do when everything you've been dreaming about suddenly drops out of the ceiling after work one day and starts to tell you a fantastic story?  How will they work it out?  Can two worlds be brought together?  And what about the brutal ex (maybe) girlfriend?  If you suspend your disbelief, you'll find that you like this book.  It's worth your time.	2002-01-01

Relationships have to be worked at and come with all of the baggage of what went before.  Keagan Donovan has been hurt before, badly, and she thinks her life will be better if she avoids romantic relationships.  She didn't count on Rudy Whitman showing up and complicating her plan.  The nice thing about this book is that they don't take one look at each other, fall passionately in love and go off into the sunset.  The relationship develops in fits and starts with a lot of misunderstandings.  At the end of the book, though they're finally together, you still know that these two are going to have to keep working to make this relationship permanent and that's a nice touch of reality.  Definitely worth your time to read.	2001-12-28

I thought it would be an interesting concept to have three different endings for the same story.  It wasn't.  The middle story isn't bad, but the first and third stories aren't interesting at all.  The first one asks you to believe that someone who went to the Olympics and then had a pretty cosmopolitan experience ended up basically barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen.  The third one is even more confusing.  And what's with the ending?  Which life is it supposed to be?  Save your money and don't buy this.	2001-12-26

First, it should be said that all of these books make pleasant reading and the characters do draw you into the story.  The problem is that Carr's writing isn't showing any improvement.  Her vocabulary is limited (How many times can you use the word beautiful on one page and in one story?) and her conversations are stilted.  Too often there are mental asides that are supposed to reveal the characters' thoughts when better constructed dialog would do the same thing.  When you consider all three books take place over a period of just a few months, you have to wonder how many times two women can be shot, poisoned, run off the road and nearly killed in several manners before people are afraid to be around them.  Never fear, except for two crazy relatives, everyone else they know loves them completely, sees no wrong in anything they do (even when Lex is constantly losing her temper and roughing someone up) and totally supports them.  Even Lex's father, who supposedly abandoned her years ago, turns up and it seems really loved her dearly all that time, he just didn't know how to show it.  Uh, huh.  Go back to the original point though.  The book is still good reading and it's a good story, almost in spite of the characters.	2001-12-20

I liked Claire of the Moon and, despite some reviews, thought I'd give this one a chance.  The cover is the best part of the book.  It appears Conn was trying to unload some demons, tell some history and weave two short stories together into a book.  This is the story of a woman who fails in Hollywood, flees to the Oregon coast and tries to get back to her real nature by writing a book based on the writers, poets and artists (gay and non-gay) who made Paris their base during the 1920s.  The Paris story is actually the best of the two, but can be confusing if you're not familiar with who those people were and what they were doing.  Conn's book also is confusing because she switches between the two stories with no warning and it's sometimes difficult to figure out which one you're in.  The woman who is supposed to be writing the Paris story is another lesbian who throws away a perfect relationship for her work and doesn't realize what she's lost until it's too late.  That's probably reality, but it's depressing to read.  If the two stories had been separated into two short stories, I think they would both have been more successful.  At least the Paris story is satisfying.  The last twenty pages of the book are the best, if you can last that long.	2001-12-16

You get a chance to see how they developed and the forces at work on them instead of the plot being hastily thrown together in an attempt to &quot;get at the good parts&quot;.  Until the end of this book, you can't be sure if this situation is going to work out for these two women or not.  Both of the main characters are appealing and the kind of people that you wish really existed.  Maybe they do and they're just so rare not enough people get to know their kind.  If you like to read, you'll like this book.  If you like a love story that doesn't jump off of the first page, but develops fully, you'll like it even more.	2001-12-09

Granted there are women who have had bad relationships and have difficulty recovering from them.  There are gay men who are afraid to come out to their families.  There are gay men and lesbian women who maintain sham marriages for appearance sake.  And there are older lesbians who find it difficult to accept that a much younger woman would be interested in them.  It takes a really good story to put all of this together and make it come out sounding even slightly possible.  And the ending will stretch credibility even more.  It is a good story though and Herring uses her usual touch to create really romantic, steamy scenes.  This story might just be true for someone somewhere.  At any rate, it's still a good story.	2001-11-25

This time she definitely does.  Cassidy James is asked to help a friend's niece who has been sent to  isolated Camp Turnaround where troubled teens are taught to modify their behavior.  The camp's name alone should tell you that not everything is as it should be.  The niece is able to sneak out an email to her father claiming that one of the camp teachers has been murdered and that the girl's life is now in danger.  From there, the action unfolds.  This book has a greater variety of characters than usual for a Cassidy James story and they're better developed.  Until the end, you can't be exactly sure who the bad guys are and there are two twists that make it worthwhile getting to the end of this book.  Also, Cassidy finds a new love interest, which may finally free her from the clutches of on-again-off-again girlfriend Erika.  Now, if Calloway would just add a little more spice to the love stories instead of &quot;shying away&quot; at the critical moments, her books would be almost perfection.	2001-11-24

Cleever goes undercover to infiltrate an organization that trains terrorists in the wilds of Australia. The action is well paced and the characters are interesting. Things become complicated when Cleever finds herself falling for one of the instructors at the camp. Add to that the fact that she's being hunted by a madman who thinks she is the sister he has vowed to kill. There's plenty in this book to keep your attention. The only weakness is that the ending seems rushed compared to the rest of the book. The last couple of chapters read almost like the notes for the story instead of finished chapters. It's still a good book.	2001-11-20

Some parts of it are so convoluted and twisted that you have to keep reading to make sure you understand what is going on.  Yes, the book contains mother-daughter incest, but it's presented in a way that you find it more pathetic or sad than disgusting.  It finally turns into a lesbian novel, but not until the end.  I'm not sure I liked Landy, the main character.  She's certainly one of the most complex individuals I've encountered in a book in a while.  I'm not sure I liked the book either, though I didn't hate it.  I would say that you have to read the book and decide for yourself.  It still has me thinking.	2001-11-15

It shows the typical lack of character development and choppiness that occurs with first books.  There are a number of holes in the story that should have been filled in.  Herring's later books show her growth as an author.  Having said that, this is still a good story, though a little stilted.  You have to wonder how much Herring really knows about lesbians in France and the wine business.  Anyway, the characters are appealing and the romance is very erotic.  Well worth the read.	2001-11-11

She has a good story, but everything develops too quickly and on the surface.  Nicole Stone is a detective and her partner is shot under mysterious circumstances.  She goes to the airport to meet his sister who is coming in that day and the two begin to fall for each other practically at first sight.  Talaran has a good story and parts of it are properly detailed.  When Nic is investigating the case, there is good detail about the work, although, if a police officer really lost her temper that much and got physical with suspects, she probably wouldn't keep her badge very long.  There's not enough interplay between Nic and Carly though and the relationship definitely needs more development.  The book is a good read, but a follow up would help to tie up the loose ends.	2001-11-08

And they live on opposite sides of the country.  One is a city girl and the other loves the country.  17 years difference in their ages seems to be the least of the hurdles they have to clear. The obstacles to these two unfold gradually and it's interesting to see how they deal with them.  And there are two refreshing points to this book.  The first is a woman well in her forties who is suddenly discovering who she is, which seems so true to life.  Not every lesbian comes out of the womb realizing who she is. The second is that not everything goes well, again realistic.  The love scenes are steamy and the book is a pleasant read.  Highly enjoyable.	2001-11-03

The storylines revealed in Return to Isis are resolved and a lot of action is packed in this book.  It's much stronger than the second book and reflects the first book more clearly.  Kali emerges as the dominant force in confronting the evil Arinna, but Whit's personality becomes more complex and better developed.  Some of the supporting characters are also better developed and play integral parts in the story.  There is also some foreshadowing for the fourth book, so it will be interesting to see if that book continues as a strong development in the series or not.  If you are a science fiction fan, you would find any of these books satisfying.  They'll also appeal to you if you're into women's history, Celtic traditions or the beliefs of Wicca.  It's interesting that several women's books have included the science of parthanogenesis, where women's eggs can be combined to create a child without sperm, since recent scientists say this will be completely possible with a variation of cloning.

There's none of the drama of the first book of discovering who these people are, unless you count the villain who shows up in this book and you don't see enough of her to get a feel for her except for pure evil.  The third book in the series probably has the excitement as Kali has to deal with the victim and Whit has to deal with that.  There is some development of other characters, so this very much has the feel of a transition piece.  It seems as if this was a two book idea that got divided into three.

These women would have to have the recuperative powers of Superman to survive the lives in this book and the one before it.  How many times can someone be hit over the head, break ribs, break and sprain limbs and be poisoned and recover the next day?  And their family members are unbelieveable.  Based on these books (Destiny's Crossing is the first), why would any lesbian be afraid to come out to her family?  To these people, having a lesbian lover is no problem at all as long as they love each other.  Yeah, right.  Lex meets the grandfather she's been estranged from for twenty-five years and, when he meets Amanda, in the next breath, all he has to do is adjust to the relationship.  Lex and Amanda are two likeable characters, but I wouldn't want to be their insurance provider.  And one could only hope that, in the real world, lesbians would find family members, friends and hospital staffs so willing to give them so much support.  If you want to read a good story that suspends reality and never delivers a love scene more explicit than to say Lex kissed Amanda in a &quot;sensitive spot&quot;, this is the book for you.	2001-10-21

Carr had a good story, but she hurt the book by writing simplistic dialogue that was too repetitive.  How many times does she have to say that Amanda is the &quot;little blonde&quot; before we get the point?  The whole time I was reading the book I kept wondering what was wrong because I liked the story concept, but I found it irritating at the same time.  Then I realized that the sentences are too simplistic and the characters just a little too much over the top to be believeable, especially all of the family members of Lex and Amanda.  They're either too good or too bad.  And what about Lex?  With as much as she seems to like beating up people, it's a wonder she doesn't have a prison record.  And how often can you break bones and get shot in a short period and still be believeable?  The book also reminded me of movies before the 1970s.  In those movies, every time you got to a love scene, the camera suddenly panned to the moon or waves crashing on the beach, then returned to two satisfied lovers.  This book does the same thing.  You'd almost think they are vampires with as much as they nibble on each other's necks.  I kept waiting for the scene where the passion would explode and it never arrived.  I bought the sequel, Hope's Path, at the same time and it seems, at least from the first few pages, to be more of the same.  Oh well, at least it will probably be a good story.	2001-10-18

The writing is immature and the character development nonexistent.  First you meet Chris, who is so shy and has been so busy running a business that she's never had any sexual experience.  She finally falls in love only to lose her partner a few months later in an accident.  Determined to try again, she meets Merry at a party and instantly falls in love with her.  They become good friends, but Merry makes it clear that gay people disgust her.  They decide to go camping one weekend, get caught in a lightning storm and somehow get transported to another time.  If you've gotten that far, you've probably read the best part of the book.  The rest is an unrealistic look at how they cope with their situation and &quot;discover&quot; each other at the same time.  Talk about suspending reality!  I don't know if this was Ennis' first book, last book or somewhere in between, but she definitely went off the rails with this.  It's too bad because her other books aren't bad.  In fact, compared to this one, they're great.	2001-09-17

Unfortunately, she no sooner has her staff in place than the airline is targeted by a terrorist organization.  The description of the head of the terrorists and how he functions doesn't even thinly disguise the fact that Reilly has Osama Bin Laden in mind.  Phillips has to find a way to stop this man from killing people and her partner Rebecca is ready to help her.  They get themselves involved in some pretty unrealistic situations, but this is a novel and it makes for great reading.  If you've read the previous two books involving Kate and Rebecca, you'll see their relationship develop even further.  This book is one that is hard to put down.	2001-09-17

She tells the story of two women who are brought together by a terrible accident and how their lives begin to intertwine.  What makes this book so good is that, unlike a lot of lesbian fiction, Miller doesn't try to squeeze all of her story into 150 pages.  I sometimes think lesbian authors think if they make their books any longer, they'll lose their audience, so things often happen at a pace that denies logic.  Miller doesn't do that.  She takes the time to develop her characters and their stories so that you are drawn in.  The relationship develops gradually as it would normally and the book is enriched by the development of other characters also.  I would put Miller in the same category with Karin Kallmaker, maybe better than some of Kallmaker's books.	2001-09-15

It captures the misery of the living conditions and the abysmal lives of factory workers.  Rose and Kathleen arrive in New York knowing no one, but each having big dreams for her future.  They both find out very quickly that the dreams may be harder to achieve than they thought, but their growing relationship makes everything more bearable.  The biggest fault with this book is that it doesn't develop the details enough, so that the horrific Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, which really occurred, becomes almost a minor event in the book.  This is definitely worth reading.	2001-09-14

Things go fine until the people in town discover that the women are lesbians and then the lovers find themselves shunned by everyone, especially the men who run all of the businesses.  Suddenly, their credit is no good, the bank won't give them a loan and they find they've been fenced away from the necessary water.  In the midst of this, two drifters, a man and his pregnant wife, come into their lives when the drifters try to steal a chicken to eat from the farm.  These four find themselves in an uneasy alliance to try and get in a year's crops that will make the farm successful.  True success comes when the women of the town decide to rally around the lesbians because of their own frustrations with how their husbands treat them.  The end of the story is a little unsatisfying, but the book is worth the read.	2001-09-10

It's almost as if she wasn't sure what she wanted to do with this story. It's about Sarah and Fran who have lived together for five years, but Sarah is restless. Sarah moves out to go looking for whatever it is she thinks she needs, which appears, for a while at least, to be a lot of fishing. Fran is devastated, but distracted by having to care for her mother who is deteriorating with Alzheimer's. Fran is also entangled with the straight estranged wife of a man she works with who is violent. Sarah is being pursued by another woman and finds herself living with two gay men. These men don't make any sense at all. I guess it's a pretty good look at the mundane lives of even gay people, but I never felt drawn into the story like I have with other books by this author.	2001-08-31
US	50728990	R36SRVZ92NK0NT	0941483770	616285052	Side by Side	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Quirky novel	This is an odd little novel with lots of subplots. It starts out with one of the characters expressing the idea that these two souls have been lovers in many past lives and will be lovers again in the future. The fact that, in this life, they both happen to be female is just the luck of the draw. And they are drawn to each other from the cradle. Eventually, they have to overcome the effects of their families discovering their relationship, but the fact that they come back together is as natural as breathing. The rest of the story shows what it must have been like to be lesbian around the time of Stonewall and when the gay movement was fighting for this lifestyle to be accepted by the general public. There are also some glimpses of what older lesbians had had to go through and the stuggle between older and younger lesbians over whether or not to be activists in the movement. It's interesting that Patricia finds it easier to demonstrate against the Vietnam War, which did not involve her, than she did for gay rights, which did. There are some humorous scenes along their paths of discovery. Miller uses the unusual device of having one character tell her story in one chapter and then the other one tells the same events from her standpoint in the next. In all, it's a pleasant novel to read, but lacks the punch of some later writers.	2001-08-27

When it seems like they're talking in a code they understand, but you don't know it? Well, this is their book. There is enough of a story here that you can follow along, but you always get the sense that there's a plot running in the background that the characters know, but you aren't seeing. Some of their conversations and actions don't make sense to you, but seem perfectly normal to them. Amory seems to spend her whole life doing things just because they happen and not because she's really drawn to them. Relationships just seem to spring up for no reason. I suppose it's supposed to be telling that Cady tells Amory many times that she loves her and Amory's only response is, &quot;I know you do&quot;. This woman is missing something inside. And the ending left me totally confused. I bought this because the Naiad catalog gave it such a great write up. Maybe they wrote it so that they could get rid of their copies of this book.

She arranges for a concert where famous stars from Hollywood and Broadway will perform and then all of them will announce to the world at the same time that they are gays and lesbians. That's the fantasy part of the book. The more realistic plot is about the columnist, Helen, starting a new relationship with a classical pianist, Cory, and whether they will be able to make the relationship work when they want some very different things.

Each chapter is by a different person giving testimony because the main character is caught in a custody battle over the children with her ex-husband.  It makes the story very disjointed.

US	50728990	R3MQSSH6DI60J8	1562802321	373930064	Omaha's Bell	Books	2	4	4	N	Y	Fair, but not great	This is a rather trivial story about a woman living outside of Omaha in the late 1800s.  She doesn't like the town much, but she does like the woman who runs the restaurant, despite the fact that she has a good woman back on the homestead.  The progression of the story is rather mundane.  Even the &quot;mystery&quot; of who stole the bell isn't much of a mystery by the end of the book.  Some of the dialogue is supposed to reflect the frontier life of the people, but the only down home phrase missing was Aw, shucks.  What we need is a library that specializes in loaning out women's novels, so that something like this can be read without having to pay for it.	2001-08-18

The story and the characters are well developed.  You wish the book was longer so that you could know them better.  And this is a world where women can get other women pregnant.  Interesting concept.  It was interesting to read a story set in a world where women and men were truly equal and all sexual preferences were accepted.  Of course, it has to be fantasy.  Unfortunately, there is no sequel to this book yet, but readers can always hope.	2001-08-17

There was a lot to the story that Conn was forced to edit out of the movie to shorten the running time.  Once you read the book, you wish that Conn could have afforded to keep the movie the length she intended.  The book also explains some things that seem disjointed in the movie.  Claire's struggle to decide what exactly it is she wants in her life is interesting.  Noel's reluctance to get involved with a &quot;straight&quot; woman is understandable.  The story isn't as much about seduction as it it inevitability.  It would be nice to have a follow up to see how this pair ended up later.	2001-08-15

This story is interesting in that it presents some interesting conflicts.  What if you think you're about to marry the right man and then find yourself falling for his sister?  What if the sister has a bright political career that could be destroyed by the voters knowing she is a lesbian?  And, just to add another complication, how do you keep from falling in love with your brother's fiance?  The answers to these questions make for a very interesting story.	2001-08-15
US	50728990	RAR5850EM93UX	0967775388	106856458	The Question of Sabotage	Books	1	2	5	N	Y	Avoid this book	Unless you want to read a political rant thinly disguised as a novel, don't buy this book.  There is very little story here and what there is borders on being silly.  I thought I was going to be reading about a woman discovering herself.  That certainly isn't what happened.  What you will get is a lesson in what a women's festival is supposed to be about (according to this author), the divisions among lesbians, racism, male bashing and some extended gnashing of teeth about daughters of Holocaust survivors.  The main conclusion I came away with was that, if this is how women's festivals are conducted, I'm glad I haven't been to one.  The &quot;mystery&quot; in this has a ridiculous conclusion.  None of the characters are well developed.  This book isn't worth the cost, even at the used price.  It took me about two hours to read the whole thing.  I'm disappointed that Amazon recommended this turkey. Save your money.	2001-08-15

She has a great relationship going with KT, but she can't seem to keep herself from messing it up.  When she should just walk away from temptation or use a simple \\"No\\", she seems incapable of doing that.  When it comes to her personal relationship, she can always be counted on to make many mistakes that in real life probably would not have a happy ending. And what's wrong with KT that she keeps putting up with this mess?  What saves the book is that, as usual, Maiman has included some interesting storylines besides the romance and some hot ....  Besides, you have to read the book just to see how Robin redeems herself by the end.  Maiman says she's skipping years in the series now, but Robin doesn't seem to be moving forward emotionally at the same rate.  If there is another book in the series coming, let's hope that Robin Miller has caught up to the timeline.	2001-08-06
