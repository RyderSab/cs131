There are probably a handful of beautiful figures and that is it!I have 500 bowls, 500 teapots and 500 cups and love each of these books, they are all fantastic, this ,500 figures, quite frankly sucks!Don't waste your money on this book, buy one of the other \\"500\\" books, they are superb!	2005-05-06
