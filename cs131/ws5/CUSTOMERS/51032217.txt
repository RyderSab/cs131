US	51032217	RK7Y7GSZHPYR	0878332162	106804739	I Was That Masked Man	Books	5	29	30	N	Y	Lifelong fan	Like most of the others here, I'm a lifelong fan of the Lone Ranger, and Clayton Moore was my favorite Lone Ranger.  I have a signed lithograph hanging in my living room.<br /><br />I am also a huge fan of Hollywood biographies.<br /><br />My biases being clear, I have to say that like everyone else, I loved Clayton Moore's story.  He's a genuine good guy, has nice things to say about everyone he worked with, and always tried to find the good in people.  People responded to him in kind, even in the days of hippie rebellion.<br /><br />Clayton Moore's relationship with the character of the Lone Ranger is unique.  He was typecast, but wanted to be typecast.  After playing the Lone Ranger, it's the only character he ever wanted to play.  Even Jay Silverheels had no intention of being Tonto forever.  Moore spent the rest of his life going to schools, shopping malls, etc., portraying either the Lone Ranger or portraying himself as the Lone Ranger.  He spent the rest of his life trying to embody the Ranger Creed.  No other actor was as closely tied to a character as was Moore.  Even his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame says both Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger.<br /><br />Even the stories of being fired for Season 3 of the TV show, being called back for Season 4, and the legal wrangling over the use of the mask were downplayed in favor of discussing his relationship with his fans, some of whom he met at both 5 and 50 years of age.  His comment?  The adoration in their eyes for the Lone Ranger was the same at any age.<br /><br />If you were ever a fan of the show, the photos alone are worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Also, if you need large print books, the print in this edition is quite large.  No need to look for a large print edition.	2005-08-03

His life and wit was every bit as colorful as his best known creation.<br /><br />Edward Tanner's life was full of contradictions.  He was a success who's father always considered him a failure.  He was a gay man who loved having a family, including wife and children.  He was a success who was afraid of the day he would become old hat, and saw that day arrive.<br /><br />I was mostly interested in how he lost all his millions (he spent lavishly until it was gone), and went on to become a successful butler.  I was especially fascinated by his brief stint as a butler to the Kroc family.<br /><br />The best parts of this book are the inclusion of letters to his children and friends.	2005-05-17

A previous review said she thought it was written by a very bad ghost writer, and that is not a harsh criticism!<br /><br />If you're a fan, but not a collector, here's the poop from Moose County:<br /><br />1.  Brrr has a huge 200th anniversary celebration.<br /><br />2.  Qwill does another one-man show, another radio broadcast of a disaster, this time a big snowstorm of 1913.  Research provided by Thornton Haggis.<br /><br />3.  Polly is training her library replacement and is studying the psychology of running the new bookstore.<br /><br />4.  Ground broke for the new bookstore.  An empty pirate's chest was found.  The new store will be called The Pirate's Chest.<br /><br />5.  Bushy, the photographer gets married.<br /><br />6.  The back of the book contains 2 recipes, one for Reuben sandwiches, and one for Molasses cookies.<br /><br />7.  Yum Yum's favorite toy is a silver thimble.<br /><br />8.  Never mind the murders.  They're unimportant.<br /><br />Some Goofy Stuff:<br /><br />1.  There is a murder on Qwill's property, and he is not in the least curious.<br /><br />2.  There is a brief conversation with Susan Exbridge about Iris Cobb, but no explanation of who she was (a main character that was murdered very early in the Cat Who series).<br /><br />3.  There are various discussions about marmalades, both a marmalade competition in Brrr, and a new marmalade cat for the new book store, to be named Dundee (after the English marmalade).  No connection to a plot or a sub-plot.<br /><br />4.  Former investigator Simmons comes from California to be a surprise guest at the wedding.  His investigative skills are not used his presence in the book is not even a red herring.  Just odd.<br /><br />5.  There is a forced plane landing with the bookstore architect on it.  He finds the experience \\"interesting.\\"  Also not a red herring, just odd.<br /><br />6.  There are plenty goofy examples.<br /><br />I hope this saves some people the price of this book.  But I love the population of Moose County and wouldn't mind if this series gave up the murder investigations altogether and just captured the townspeople in the fabric of their lives.County and wouldn't mind if this series gave up the murder investigations altogether and just captured the townspeople in the fabric of their lives.	2005-02-01

Jean Arthur (Gladys Greene) never managed to fit in anywhere.  Not Hollywood, not teaching, not the theater, not family.  She left a glittering film legacy, but I just felt sad for her.  Full of energy, full of life, yet so alone.	2004-12-06

The lovely black dog in the story is an unsung hero who saves a baby floating away in the rain.  I named my black lab Bruno after the dog in this story.<br /><br />Many of Edward Gorey's stories are too adult or too black for children.  But if your child is thoughtful and imaginative, I would recommend this one.<br /><br />This is a must for Gorey collectors.<br /><br />And for the one person in the universe who doesn't know this, Gorey began the beautiful black and white illustrations used on Public Television's Mystery series (he didn't finish them because he died).	2004-08-31

Terrible!<br />But the story of this strong and smart Chinese woman carries the book despite the terrible writing.<br />Polly, a name thrust on her by her owner in California, is a Chinese peasant girl who is sold into slavery by her impoverished family.  Eventually, in California's &quot;wild west,&quot; and with her consent, a white friend bought her out of her concubinage and they ran a boarding house together.  Later, their relationship blossomed into something more serious.  Since an interracial relationship in those days was intolerable, they bought a farm far from the rest of the world on a creek named Polly Creek after her.  There, they both lived happily ever after until their deaths.<br />The story of Polly's survival skills, inventiveness, hard work and great love is what this book is all about.  I learned alot about self-reliance and creative thinking.	2004-02-12

This collection is great, but not as good as The Groucho Letters.  Since these are only to his daughter, Miriam, they don't reflect aspects of his personality that show up in The Groucho Letters, which are collected from diverse people, family, friends, and other show people, not to mention Warner Brothers during a law suit.<br />But I love this collection because Groucho comes across as a loving and concerned parent who can't get enough of his children.  He is supportive, generous, thoughtful and witty.	2004-02-05

This book is the first in the Loon Lake, Lew Ferris Police Chief, fly fishing series.<br />Although the series touts tough, fly fishing Ms. Lew Ferris as police chief, the book is told through the eyes of retired dentist Dr. Osbourne, who is deputized to be a forensic dentist.  Usually in this genre, the story is told through the actual detective.  Seeing the mystery unfold second-hand through the dentist's eyes is different, and frankly, not as interesting.  His contributions to the clue-finding are tripping over the body and identifying that her gold fillings have been pulled out.  For the rest of the clues, the reader must rely on what Chief Ferris chooses to tell him.  This is complicated by Dr. Osbourne's developing crush on the police chief.<br />I don't think this author is as good a writer as, for example, Earlene Fowler (quilting mysteries) or Diane Mott Davidson (culinary mysteries with excellent recipes included).  However, if you are desperate for another author who can be relied on to keep to the genre, I would recommend this author, Victoria Houston (the name sounds made up, doesn't it?).	2004-01-26

Ferber does her justice in the end, when Selina achieves &quot;gravitas,&quot; the state of being satisfied with her life and wise in old age.<br />Typically, her son doesn't appreciate what his mother has given him until his is older and can see her through his girlfriend's eyes.  Suddenly she becomes clear to him as a heroine.<br />This story even inspired me to each vegetables more!  I can only hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.	2004-01-18

While I can't speak to the veracity of the facts involved, I can say with certainty that I loved this story of a man in the wilderness making friends with a wolf pack.  He lovingly dedicates the book to one of his wolf friends.<br />Mowat goes alone into the Alaskan wilderness to study the wild wolves, who are being exterminated because of a belief that they are eating livestock.  Mowat tries as well as humanly possible to live as he sees the wolves living.  He drinks gallons of tea so he can pee around his camp to mark his territory.  He eats rodents to see if he gets his full complement of dietary needs.  He takes &quot;wolf naps&quot; so that he can watch them interact with one another during all hours.  He even notes baby-sitting habits.<br />Unusually, the movie that was made from this book keeps to the story pretty accurately.  I would recommend that, also.	2003-12-14

The photographs are worth the price alone, but the recipes are fabulous and healthful.  There's also a Table of Equivalents included in the back.

Marge Piercy said exactly what I had wanted to say.  It's all about the freedom, yet confinment, of the sexual revolution, the questions asked at that time about the real similarities and differences between men and women, i.e., nature versus nurture, etc.  Marge P. is a wonderful writer, and I enjoy all her material immensely.  The small stories about all people contained in this novel become dear to one's heart.	2003-12-10

I love it when real life surpasses fictional imagination.  The story of Mr. Stoll's discovery of a hacker in his university's computer network, and the international chase that ensued was thrilling.  His all-nighters, help from his girlfriend (turned ex-girlfriend by the book's end), and triumphant and happy ending makes for fascinating reading.<br />I think that this book would make a wonderful movie, even if the technology is way outdated by now.  Hollywood -- pay attention.	2003-12-07

I'm not justifying having children out of wedlock, but the man was very funny.<br />But the story of Milton Berle's life is also touching and full of real affection for his family and friends. He either lived with or was in close contact with his mother (the original stage mother!) on a daily basis, and even made it into a record book for doing just that. His description of his mystical visits with her after her death was charming.<br />Eventually, Berle settled down with a down-to-earth woman, to whom he stayed married until his death. He was very proud of her. While he and many other entertainers were either 4F or doing entertainment duties during the war, she was a veteran.<br />This book is also insightful into the history of stand-up comedy. Theft of material was rampant, and Berle was famous for being one of the most thieving. He was proud of it, but justifies it by proving that lots of others did it, too, and that his material was also stolen.<br />This was a fun autobiography, and I recommend it. I also recommend A Dreadful Man, which is a biography of George Sanders based on letters from his last wife.	2003-12-07

When I first opened this book, it began with stuff that sounded very New Age to me, which put me off.  However, I continued reading, and found that the book is actually very common sense, with good and even practical ideas for psychic growth.<br />Whether you are New Age, common sense, or even skeptical, I think you will find this book both well written and entertaining.  Like others, I'm finding it very useful for the purpose.	2003-11-30

I enjoyed every page of this book of commentary on the 5 books of Moses.  I even tried the recipe for red lentils that was offered as the meal that Jacob might have fed to Esau in exchange for his father's birthright.<br />Ms. Frankel is a noted Jewish scholar, and this book should not be taken lightly, or as a pure exercise of fiction.  She is trying to find the voices of Jewish women that were lost in history, whether sad, bitter, or even humorous.<br />Reading this book, which is broken out into the individual Torah portions, with encapsulations of the Biblical texts, was a wonderful treat.  It not only gives its own differing perspectives, but encourages one to think for onesself, to go a different road if that's where your thoughts take you.<br />This book is well written and lots of fun.  I recommend it to everyone with an interest in Torah (or Old Testament!) studies.	2003-11-12

It is NOT a book about increasing your personal wealth or about Wall Street high finance.<br />That being said, this book is wonderfully well written, full of surprises, and the reference to the game of Liar's Poker carries well as a vehicle throughout the book.  It was scary and comical to see what brokers and traders are actually doing with my money once I hand it over to them.<br />I am glad that Michael Lewis survived his time on in the stock market and lived to tell us all about it.  I will undoubtedly reread this book some time.	2003-11-01

I never laughed out loud once.  But I enjoyed the book because Mickey Katz came across as a warm person who cared deeply about his family, good music, and genuinely entertaining people in the manner they wished to be entertained.  A conservative group would get a show tailored to them.  A Las Vegas audience would get a show tailored to them.  He was concerned for others always, especially his audiences.  He always wanted them to get their money's worth.<br />I was raised to think of Mickey Katz just as a Jewish comedian.  I had no idea he was such an accomplished musician and showman.  But his pride in his own accomplishments was dwarfed by his pride in his children's accomplishments, pride that was equally split between his two sons, one being the actor Joel Gray and the other being one of the founders of Telecredit.<br />Mickey Katz was my father's cousin, and I must admit that I bought the book looking for clues to my own father's life.  I got something different, but something good nonetheless.<br />If your taste runs to the heartwarming autobiography, this is it.	2003-11-01

It was a true American entrepreneurial tale, and I'm glad they've had success.  The descriptions of the dogs were also compelling.<br />I have to admit, though, that I've tied several of the recipes, and my dog never cared much for the results.  The ginger snaps in particular seemed inedible to him.

Lincoln changed his interpretation of black-white relations to suit his target audience.  With no national press available to put his feet to the fire, any candidate could change his opinions at any time to seek votes.<br />Douglas, although he was the same man throughout the campaign, had distasteful views to our modern perspective.  Only white Christian men had anything worthwhile to offer society.  Everyone else was an unpleasant burden for them to suffer with (noblesse oblige).<br />When I started to read the speeches, I expected Lincoln to be the obvious winner in the debates.  He's a winner to me, but by a much smaller margin than anticipated.  Anyone who wants to know history from the mouths of the actual players should read this book.	2003-10-22

The book was a clean, even noble, discussion of Ron Kovic's early optimism in life and his later disillusionment with the war and the government's treatment of veterans.<br />This book is the story of Mr. Kovic's early all-American years before the war, his war experiences, his injury experiences, and his changes of heart that drove him to activism.<br />I would love to read a second volume of Mr. Kovic's life story and get an update on his life to date.	2003-10-22

Also, the dynamics between her and her disabled woman boss.  Dolores overcame many obstacles in her life, and there is not quite a happy ending.<br />Yes, the book is vaguely a murder mystery, but all the plot threads had me captivated from the beginning.<br />I take one star away from the book because it can get quite graphic about body functions -- after all she was a parent with nose-picking children and took care of a disabled woman with a  bedpan.  If you don't like that kind of realism, don't read this, but if you can stand the discussions, this is a great read.  I was rooting for Dolores the whole way.	2003-09-04

The definition of mother grows with our abilities to accept more nurturers and teachers in our lives.  It is very important to accept the fact about our mothers that they were only human and did the best they could, but that's another life lesson that can ripple more globally.<br />Ultimately, this book is about choosing mentors and tolerance for human frailties.  I'm glad it's still in print.	2003-08-14

The author never questions the morality of gay romance -- it's just another aspect of life.  The larger issues for this couple are the teacher/student and older/younger problems that stand in the way of the course of true love.  In addition, they also are opposites who attract about vegetarian versus carnivore, military versus pacifist and former hetero versus always comfortable as a gay.  Yet despite the inherent problems, the reader always roots for these two to finally work things out.<br />Sports and running are ultimately what molds and holds these two together.  The shocking end is unforgettable.	2003-08-02

I couldn't stop feeding my own and Fiedler's fascination for people who would fall into the \\"Freaks\\" category for whatever reason.<br />Fiedler, who had an unnatural feeling his whole life that he had a missing twin, had such an obsession with the history and humanity of freaks, he finally had to quench it by writing this book.<br />The book is a history of freaks before surgery made it possible for many of them to have the appearance of normalcy.  It's also the story of their humanity and their struggles to survive under difficult and often unkind conditions.  I came away with a much deeper understanding of what it means to be human, in any and all forms.  I found myself seeing everyone as normal, rather than as \\"other.\\"<br />If you've always had a hidden passion to understand what is typically considered unnatural, I recommend this book.  Ultimately, people are people.	2003-07-19

The author describes the history of society's attitude toward death and how it has changed with advances in medicine.  Early on, death was accepted at any age as inevitable and in its own time.  This attitude is contrasted with our modern-day concept of life being forever, with all of us hanging on by our fingernails until the last gasp.<br />The examples, particularly ones from the Civil War of the mortally wounded soldiers preparing themselves to become corpses, affected me profoundly.  I haven't seen life or death the same since reading this book.<br />Are we asking too much of our doctors?  Are we ungracious or blind in our wish to ignore the inevitable?  These days, someone must be at fault for a death; someone should pay.  Very little grace when confronting the vast eternal that comes to us all.  Or are we, after all, entitled to life everlasting on earth if only science and medicine could just hurry up?	2003-07-11

I found this book as an adult 30 years ago, and I had to buy a second copy to use as a loaner.  Given the prices shown here, I should probably give one copy up for sale, but I can't part with it.<br />For the lonely people out there who think that there is only one soulmate to be found, this book says otherwise.  Love comes in a variety of forms and packages if you're open to it.	2003-07-11

I own a hardcopy and a paperback, and have read it several times over the years.<br />It's the story of a mother and daughter living alone together.  The mother finds a hairy boyfriend that the daughter nicknames \\"The Wolfman.\\"  The story progresses as The Wolfman becomes more and more a part of their lives, until he finally moves in.  This book is one of the earliest children's books to deal with a single mother and a live-in boyfriend.  But the story is handled gracefully, and the child is fully accepting of the situation.  If anything, the awkwardness of the adults makes the child want to make them more comfortable with the situation.<br />I highly recommend for either children, or for adult light (very light) reading.	2003-06-26

Who else would tell you that Sanders could play the guitar behind his back, or that he was an amateur electrician who routinely rewired his friends' houses?

Eventually the Krupp family business, and their dynasty, had the German goverment behind them, protecting them with their own laws and their own train spur to Der Hugel, the family estate.  The rise of the Krupp's, what they did with their power, and the eventual dying off of the family, is the study of The Arms of Krupp.  It's a powerful and profoundly moving story, given the lead role the family and its business played in arming the Germans for both World Wars and the enslavement and starvation of many prisoners.  Krupp was one of a few private companies in Germany to have its own concentration camp for Jews.<br />I was deeply shocked that the Krupp family was cleared of war crimes in Nuremburg.<br />But it's a fascinating family history, and I found it gripping from beginning to end.  The family is full of interesting and lively characters.  Someday, when I have the stomach for the gruesome parts again, I will reread it.	2003-06-07

This book was long and well-written, but it can be summed up very simply.  Fred Allen worked and sent money home to his aunt.  He got married.  They worked together and sent money home to his aunt.  I felt very ground down by work when I finished reading this autobiography.<br />But it is a very good lesson in the grind of vaudeville and how difficult it was to make the transitions from B-grade stages to A-grade stages, and from there to real theater, radio, etc.  I especially loved his description of an up and coming dancer named George Burns, who was traveling the vaudeville circuit with his partner, Lorraine.<br />As a fan of the biography genre, I couldn't resist this one.	2003-04-08

I was fascinated by the depth of the statistics and the breadth of the analyses in this book.  Although statistics can be dry, and it took me a while to plow through the entire book, it was terribly interesting none the less.<br />It's worth reading, although, in a nutshell, the premise is that Americans used to be joiners and much more social animals.  Now, they are either not joiners, or joining means something different, like paying dues to a national organization with no meetings, instead of paying dues to a local organization and meeting new friends and neighbors.  Many national organizations that meet on local levels have suffered to the point of extinction.  Even bridge clubs and bowling leagues (hence the title) have fallen out of favor.	2003-01-01

The bright colors on Sunday appealed to me.  So did the combinations of adult themes and animal themes.  Gus Arriola was the first person in my life to bring home to me that life is life, animal or human.<br />The cartoonist has a great sense of humor and a unique drawing style.  The book is essentially the story of the life of Gus Arriola, which is an interesting one, interspersed with many, many samples of his cartoons, both daily and Sunday.  So this book has to be taken as a biography rather than as a compendium of the cartoonist's work.<br />This story of the life of Gus and Mary Frances Arriola is a nice one, full of laughter and good friends and fulfilling work.  It is also very, very good to relive some of the cartoon moments that are also provided.  No, this book is not the complete works of Gordo, and I would like to see that happen someday soon.  But in its own right, it's a great book.<br />If you like cartoons and have an interest in cartoonists, you should have fun with this one.	2002-12-05

I would advise everyone to buy at least one, since they are slowly but surely going out of print.  This one is also very, very good, though not my favorite.	2002-09-09

When I began studying Judaism, her books were given to me to read as textbooks.  They are wonderfully well-written and informative.<br />Her topics engage people.  She gives you choices early on so that you can start immediately choosing where you want to go as a Jew.	2002-09-09

But I was surprised at how true it turned out to be. Her comments on most women's inner fears over the sexual revolution and the prospect of life without \\"a man\\" jived completely with my memories of the period. Her descriptions of the political climates of recent presidencies were also right on target.	2002-09-04

We relied on the two books by the Monks of New Skete for our own training as new owners.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.  These books are for all dogs, not just Shepherds.	2002-08-10

It may be too clean for jaded city folks.<br />I enjoyed this particular book very much, and I always look forward to her next one.  Her recipes are always excellent -- I've made many of them.  The architectural descriptions of castle life in this one were somewhat sketchy, but interesting.	2002-07-03

I spent my entire life having nightmares routinely.  After reading this book, I have conquered them for good.  I cannot believe how simple it was, or how effective its been.<br />Like many one topic books, this one should be a chapter in a larger book instead of its own volume.  But I can't argue with its success.	2002-07-03

I also attend synagogue regularly, and most of this stuff is routine from the service.<br />While this book was well written, it is for novices and non-attendees and their children.<br />I do not have a title to recommend for adults preparing for bar/bat mitzvah.	2002-07-03

While most of the discussion was very clearcut and to the point, some of it was definitely the psychology of muddy reasoning that I found confusing.  However, my bedroom makeover turned out fantastic, and every time I'm in the room, I feel happy.<br />I loaned this book to a friend, who in turn, loaned it to her daughter.  They are also happy with their results.	2002-07-03

Even though I figured out the mystery very early on, I still enjoyed it very much.<br />This book is the rare mystery where the murderer never gets a legal comeuppance.	2002-07-03

I found the recipes repetitive and not as appealing as the ones in his other books.<br />Unless you're desperate for Tex-Mex, I would try some of Mr. Food's other cookbooks before trying this one.	2002-07-03

Useful and well written, with lots of excellent, and sometimes uncomfortable, exercises to do with your partner.  Dr. Phil skips the touchy-feely stuff and gets right to work on the symptoms of a marriage going sour, and real solutions to problems.<br />I am not an Oprah fan and had no idea that Dr. Phil was connected to her or her TV show.  Do NOT let the Oprah connection put you off to this book!!  I cannot recommend it highly enough!	2002-07-03

Outside of the that, I found his story intriguing and his views of history enlightening.  Well written, well documented.  Made me want to read much more from his source material, plus follow up on his current career activities.	2002-07-02

If you are a person who needs &quot;babysitting,&quot; I doubt if this self-help book will be good for you.<br />The chants are sung in a comfortable mid-range, as opposed to a soprano or a bass.	2002-06-05

The book is well researched, with a variety of source material.  The author draws from both liberal and conservative sources, and from people who have been in both camps.<br />Unfortunately, the prognosis for even-handed coverage of hot button issues is poor.  Where do you go for coverage you can trust?  This book had no answers to that question.	2002-05-21

I'm sorry to see that it's out of print, and I would recommend that people interested in sewing clothes or designing clothes go the extra mile to get an old copy.	2002-04-23

They have an amazing semi-recovery due to some drug experimentation, but there is no lasting or long-term recovery.<br />Unlike the movie, there is no love story, and the Leonard character is not a lovable hero.  But the book is well written, and the medical ramifications are clearly explained for the lay-person.<br />I recommend this, and all of Oliver Sacks' books, highly.	2002-02-23

I was skeptical that such a slender volume could be of any lasting value, but I was astounded at the simple truths expressed and proactive activities this book recommends.  The book is a down-to-earth, sensible discussion of recreating one's marriage for right now, rather than relying on the information you first gleaned during dating, most of which will be quite outdated by now.	2002-02-23

I think that, as old as they are, the best books on the subject of man-talk versus woman-talk are by Dr. Joyce Brothers.<br />Men come off rather badly overall in this book, which I think reinforces the stereotypes of men being rotten communicators who never listen.<br />The book gets one star because it has an excellent reference list and great notes.	2002-01-15
US	51032217	R3IU82QRKVCV2V	0910250162	948319791	The Magen David: How the Six-Pointed Star Became an Emblem for the Jewish People	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	News to me	This entire book was news to me: the Star of David's pagan origins, it's other names, sharing it with churches and mosques, how recently it became a worldwide Jewish symbol.  Most of the source material is in German and other languages.  Plaut has done his own translations in researching this topic.  The chapters are cohesive, the flow is good, it is well written, and the illustrations are beautiful.	2001-10-18

A spiritual person can add layers to the stories and extrapolate life lessons.  Either way, the main character/author is extremely sympathetic character.  Her teacher had amazing gifts, both as a conservator and as a teacher.<br />The book is deceptively short.  Looks like a quick read, but was so meaty and detailed, I found myself reading it for several weeks in order to digest all the material carefully.<br />If your taste runs to the obscure, the &quot;sleeper,&quot; I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.	2001-09-10

It is written on a very basic level.  Wonderful reference source for when those occasional &quot;trivia question&quot; moments come up, and you simply &quot;have to know.&quot;	2001-08-13

Women talk to express feelings.<br />If you got that, that's it.  The rest of the book is puerile psychobabble.	2001-07-07

I was expecting more fleshed out biographies, perhaps outlining any adversities these folks had to endure, Jewish or otherwise.  No or almost no personal information.	2001-03-22

You should choose to read either the first half or the second half, but don't bother with the whole thing. Well written otherwise.	2001-02-28

We've all heard it said that these people were simpler people from a simpler time.  Read this book (and possibly the first one) and make that determination for yourself.	2001-02-15

Rabbi Donin may not be qualified to discuss Reform services since he is an Orthodox rabbi, which would account for the omission of the details of liberal services.  Other than that, I think he did an admirable job with a huge subject -- the basics of synagogue services, how and why.  I find his discussions both sensitive and thorough, although his attention to detail can sometimes detract from the flow of the book.	2000-10-24

Sometimes I can't tell if the section I am  reading is text or if it is a quote from someone in the past.  However, it  is full of interesting facts and lots of pictures.  I have a particular  fascination for Old West history, and this closes a gap in my material.	2000-08-22

It gets to the soul of our society's thrust toward specialization instead of applying a Renaissance approach to the totality of our brains and spirits.  Art and science can  coexist peacefully and harmoniously if we let go and live them.	2000-02-19
