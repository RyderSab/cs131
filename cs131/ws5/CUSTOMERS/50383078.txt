And does it rock the propagation of Islam and its intentions amongst non Arab nations. Being a 5th generation Indian, the section on Pakistan interested me, and the concept of the nation forged upon a poetic dream.<BR>I wont be surprised if this publication has been banned in certain Islamic nations because it really goes for the upper cut.	2003-01-05

Well written and defined, it also describes the dangers of cloning. There is hardly a flaw in this book, and its not only about dinosaurs. It more about selfish  ambitions, and the people behind them (John Hammond), their disregard for  everything arround them etc It also brilliantly describes the  phrase&quot;Nature always find a way&quot;. The filmed version also merited  5 stars but if  have to compare between the two, its the book which wins on  points.	2000-02-21

That scenario in itself  was worth a star, but from then on , the story plodded along as if it were  resting on its laurels.	2000-02-21

The research in to this book seems to have been derived from a boys mag, and some of the sub plots seem rather childish. THE  &quot;Selkie&quot; is described as an utter proessional who never makes a  mistake...big laugh.  Two stars for a couple of good chapters highlighting  the dangers posed by cyber terrorists but all in all... one for the little  kids	2000-02-21

I'm now reading &quot;Eye of The Needle&quot; which is supposed to be even better..wait for that review soon  ! Its interesting to read about the potential dangers of  human cloning;  though it seems far fetched to believe its impact now, this will be a major  ISSUE in the next decade or so. Ken Follett may have opened our eyes sooner  rather than later ..let's hope that his forthcoming works are just as good.	2000-02-14

I had just seen &quot;A FEW Good Men&quot;, and wondered to myself, OH NO not another movie where Tom Cruise plays the  lawyer. To my surprise, the story was really good even if the ending was  altered. I thought to myself that this author/scriptwriter must have  written other books. Why not have a peek at one of them . That particular  &quot;peek&quot; was &quot;The Chamber&quot;, and now, 4 years afterwards,  here I am writing this online review. The relationship between Adam and Sam  is really well penned. It just shows that bad seeds dont exist, ther is  always a time for redemption be it intra or inter generation. Pity that the  film wasn't that good.	2000-02-04

Yet, Vulture Fund though failing to reach the heights of it predecessor does fairly well. Problem is the plot will not probably appeal to those familiar  to dealings in the financial world as such but if you want a good story,  its definitely worth the money.	2000-02-04

I tended to remember this weakness rather than the excellent first &quot;80%&quot;. Also, the prose describing the body chemistry between Logan and the Italian belle is a well ... a bit teenager type puppy love	2000-02-04

The book starts off well but the character development is a bit absurd. Anyway the minituarization is a pretty novel  idea, and the ending , quite decent. One star for the cover. Quite  innovative.	1999-12-29

And it continued so ..right till the last chapter which could have better written. Anyhow Patrick Lanigan teaches a lesson or two. Never trust colleagues at work. Not Grisham's best but another feather in his already feather studded cap.	1999-12-29
US	50383078	R2YB1JGIKCN16Z	0963192574	684823314	Airframe	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Worth flying for	After having been treated to a double dinosaur special of 'Jurassic Park'and &quot;The Lost World&quot;, I was a bit skeptical of reading a Micheal Crichton novel which didn't deal with the prehistoric. Anyway he  pulled it off yet again but only just. The narrative is excellent and the  technical detail is pretty neat though I wish he had some sort of glossary  to help readers not familiar with aerospatial or avionic terms. There  seemed to be a dash of 'Rising Sun' in the plot but somehow that didnt get  developed too well. Thats why I lopped off one star . However, all in all,  a good read .Dont take it on the plane though !	1999-12-28
