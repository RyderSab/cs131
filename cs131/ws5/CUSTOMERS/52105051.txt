It is there in the historic stadiums, in the questions of the media and in the voices of the fans. It is baseball at its best. Fortunately for the fans who cherish the matchup, Harvey and Frederic Frommer have delivered a wonderful book that provides background and insight on the classic battles, 'Red Sox vs. Yankees, The Great Rivalry.' More than two years in the making, the coffee-table book by Sports Publishing contains 125 photos and escorts the fan from the first game in 1912 through the offseason moves of 2003.  - Fred Clare	2004-07-09

This book was and is a pleasere for me to read. Its pages are filled with stories of Yankees and Red Sox games and series, players and trades, fans and fights, quips and quotes, playoff wins and losses, heartbreak and joy for both teams. OK, so mostly heartbreak for the Red Sox. The Frommers start the book with a timeline that starts with the birth of Babe Ruth in 1895 and ends with the acquisition of Curt Schilling by the Red Sox in November of 2004. The book then provides an entire chapter on the Red Sox and Yankees rivalry as it was played out in the 2004 playoffs, which, while incredible to watch, somehow was not nearly as exciting to read about only a few months later. The chapter, however, like the rest of the book, is well writen, interesting in its own right, and very readable. I expect that ten or twenty years from now, I shall be able to pick up this book and find it an excellent resource as I recount my own memories of that exciting seven-game series to my own children or (God help you) yours. The book, like the rivalry it recalls, will stand the test of time, I expect. I know this because the very next chapter focuses especially on the 1978 season, and it is a great read. The Yankees and Red Sox were both vying for the AL East title and were forced to play a one-game playoff to win it, which the Yanks did, even though they had been down as much as 14 games in the standings as late as July 18th. From that huge deficit, to Reggie getting benched for dogging it, to Billy Martin getting canned to Ron Guidry's 25-3 record to Bucky-Effing-Dent, there is no dull paragraph in the chapter. Harvey and or Frederic Frommer could have made a great living as a beat writer, had they not gone into slightly more prestigious careers as an Ivy League professor and a political journalist, respectively. Moving on through the book, the Frommers spend chapters focusing on the general histories of the teams, the cultures and moods cultivated by the Rivalry, the merits and limitations of the respective ballparks, special games between the two clubs, a collection of quotes from various players, fans ad others, and list of statistics and trivia about the two teams. They even devote an entire chapter to perhaps the greatest rivalry between players on these two fabled teams, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams. Frankly, this is one area in which I think the Red Sox have a decided advantage, though I doubt if many of my fellow Yankee fans would back me up on this. As you may have deduced, the Red Sox don't have many advantages in this rivalry, and therefore I would venture a guess that this book doesn't offer nearly as much for them as it does for Yankees fans. In fact, the title, 'Red Sox vs. Yankees', is about the only time that Boston has gotten first billing in this struggle for the last three quarters of a century. Personally, I can't imagine being very excited about spending hours on end reading about the myriad disappointments and seemingly endless heartbreak associated with my chosen team, thankyouverymuch. But maybe that's just me. Regardless of your particular bent, Red Sox vs. Yankees is still a very well-done book. As a coffee-table book, it offers large, whole-panel pictures, many of them in vibrant color, to appease the eye, and solid writing to appease the mind. And even the price is right!	2004-07-09

The Frommers cover the hostilities from every angle imaginable, giving readers just about all they'll need to know as they settle in for upcoming bouts in 2004. The fun begins with a timeline of the major events that have enlivened the century-long competition, then turns to a comprehensive review of last season's epic playoff series. After a look at the roller-coaster ride of the storied 1978 AL East pennant race, the books follows with chapters on the rivalry's origins, the clashing cultures of the cites, a comparison between the hometown ballparks and capsule summaries of the most significant games. There's even an entire segment devoted to the various virtues of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio and their roles in the ongoing antagonism. Capping off the retrospectives is an open forum from both New York and Boston advocates. Politicians, sportswriters, entertainers, ordinary fans and the players themselves offer barbed , even witty viewpoints about the rivakly. Their caustic comments should provide more than enough combustion to fire up the Yankee and Sox faithful for this year's remaining games. - -	2004-07-09

For all those fans we highly recommend this new book by Harvey Frommer, a long-time chronicler of the Yankees, and his son, Frederic. They've combined a history of the two teams and their many contests with personal reminiscences--their own and those of players, other fans, and the rich and famous--and a host of terrific photographs to create a kind of scrapbook of the rivalry that some refer to as the American version of Athens (Boston) vs. Sparta (New York). In a book awash with great anecdotes it's hard to pick just one, but here's a Don Zimmer quote from the period when the tension between the two great catchers, Carlton Fisk and Thurman Munson, was as fierce as that between the teams in general: Fisk hated Munson, Munson hated Fisk, and everyone hated Bill Lee. Such hatreds have never been more enjoyable than they are in these pages.	2004-06-13

TOP STUFF	Black Athlete--------------------------------  <BR>- From the 1920 sale of Babe Ruth's contract to the current pursuit of the game's best player, one thing has been a constant. The Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. Their's is a rivalry that's had more twists and turns than an episode of 'Law and Order'. While Boston's ill-fated decision allowing the Bambino to wear the pinstripes stands as this rivalry's focal point, over the years many other things have been a part of it as well. In this latest chapter, author Harvey Frommer along with his son Frederic, capture the essence of what many feel is sports greatest rivalry. In 'Red Sox vs. Yankees: The Great Rivalry', the Frommers puts the reader right along side the people, places, and events of these two foes. You can argue that maybe Army-Navy, Celtics-Lakers, or even Dodgers-Giants may be bigger rivalries, but after reading this book you'll soon realize neither one is as passionate as Red Sox-Yankees. Ironically, the book begins with a look back at the 2003 American League Championship Series where the Yankees prevailed over the Red Sox in a 7-game series that featured everything from a beanball incident to a dramatic series-ending homer. It also takes a look at the off-season moves by both clubs following the season. Ironically, the largest move (New York acquiring Alex Rodriguez) is omitted because it happened shortly after the book was released. Along the way, you'll see archival photos (some taken by the authors themselves) of former and current greats such as Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, Reggie Jackson and Jim Rice, and Derek Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra. The Frommers also explore the dreaded 'Curse of The Bambino' from the Boston point of view. The impact of Boston's decision to let the Babe walk has been a deadly thorn in the side of every fan in Red Sox Nation. The book also includes a timeline of yearly events and how they related to the rivalry. A look at the pennant races of 1949 and 1978 (both won by New York) and their subtle similarities. From Smokey Joe Wood to Aaron 'Bleepin' Boone, the 'Great Rivaly' has a little something for all factions (Yankee fans, Red Sox fans, Yankee haters, Red Sox haters) to look at with angst or humor. Not to mention, the other players, club officials, celebrities, and others on why this rivalry remains to be a lightning rod for all sports fans. With the baseball season ready to start in earnest, the Frommer's book will more than get you ready for the season. That is, unless you root for any other team in the AL East.	2004-04-20

Anytime you can read about Josh Gibson, Roy Campanella and Satchel Paige you are in for a fun time. <br />Jackie died a young man at the age of fifty-three-years of age.

Pollsters probably didn't ask, but it's likely even fewer would have known who Branch Rickey was. That black players in particular, whose careers follow the path that these men blazed, do not comprehend and honor the debt is most troubling of all. Anyone wishing to remedy their own lack of knowledge, and even those who think they already know the whole story, will find Harvey Frommer's Rickey and Robinson an invaluable resource and a truly moving read.<br />Mr. Frommer had the novel idea of structuring the book as parallel biographies of the two men, their stories overlapping and lives knitting together for that remarkable period of years when they, almost by themselves, integrated major league baseball. Jackie Robinson's is the better known tale, from UCLA to the Army to the Negro Leagues to the Dodgers' minor leagues and then to Brooklyn, with a significant career in business and politics afterwards. And most baseball fans will be familiar with Branch Rickey's reputation as an innovator, his most lasting contributions, besides integration, to the game including the batting helmet and the organized minor league farm system. Met fans too will recall Ralph Kiner's stories about how tight-fisted and patronizing (in both the positive and negative senses) Rickey was with his players. But Mr. Frommer gives us a full picture of the man, of his religious background (which seems to have played no small part in his willingness to be a racial pioneer), his keen mind for the game and for business, and his endless maneuvering to improve his teams. Each man led a life full enough to support a biography of his own. Here we get both and they're fascinating. <br />But the event that defined their lives was the meeting on August 28, 1945, at Brooklyn Dodgers headquarters, between Rickey and Robinson. It's astonishing to realize that this first time the men ever met, Branch Rickey asked Jackie Robinson to take on the daunting task of being the first black man to play organized white baseball (at least since the color bar had been erected decades earlier). But Rickey had made a true project of the whole idea, had scouted the Negro Leagues and the personal backgrounds of the prospective players thoroughly, and he knew Robinson was uniquely well-suited-- by his ability, his intelligence, his education, his relatively middle-class California upbringing, and his temperament, desire, and will--to bear the burdens. And so \\"The Meeting\\" was not just a get acquainted session, but an opportunity for Rickey to probe and to prepare Robinson, even to the point of demonstrating the kind of taunts he should expect to hear, before offering him the bittersweet role of, as he put it: \\"carrying the reputation of a race on your shoulders.\\"<br />The whole book is enjoyable but it is this chapter that really sings. The Meeting has been the subject of books, film, stageplay, and more, but it's never been told better than here, with high drama and a sense of history, but also with an immediacy that makes the reader feel like he's a fly on the wall in Rickey's office those sixty years ago. No one can understand what happened in baseball and in American society over those sixty years without knowing the story of Rickey and Robinson and, Mr. Frommer having given us such a rewarding and readable book about the men and their noble achievement, there's no excuse for not knowing it.<BR>*****************************************************	2003-07-08

In starting this book I had a very limited knowledge of who both Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey really were. What I had were the stereotypes that other writers had projected and the history that these men are noted for. Basically Jackie Robinson was the great black player who shattered baseball's color barrier and later became a very outspoken black activist. Branch Rickey was one of the greatest general managers that baseball has ever seen - but with a reputation for being a skinflint to the point that players hated dealing with him.<br />Now both of those things were true, but I had no idea who the men behind these accomplishments really were and how they earned their reputations and their places in the history books. In reality this book is a dual biography of two men whose lives intersected, at the right moment, at the right point in time for them to make history together. History often requires all of the same ingredients as a murder; it requires motive, opportunity, means and players brave enough to make them happen.<br />Rickey had already made history and as Frommer reveals was perhaps the greatest judge of player talent who ever had his hands in the game. He also knew how to beat the system, how to tweak it, and even how to invent it - as he did when he created the modern farm system used in baseball today. He also had a fire to win, and to win at all costs, no matter how many boundaries he had to cross.<br />Rickey never claimed credit for breaking the color barrier, although it was something he definitely felt needed to be done and something he deliberately set out to do. However Rickey always admitted that he was not doing it just for altruistic purposes but he was doing it because black ballplayers were good and were an untapped source of players which could helpRickey build yet another winning team.<br />He spent a huge amount of time looking for the right man to break the color barrier. It took Rickey and his scouts months to come up with a list of three candidates who could handle the job on the diamond and it took the even longer to learn about the men off the field. In the end it came down to Robinson and Roy Campenella. Rickey made his decision after interviewing them both.<br />Robinson was atypical of the majority of players from the Negro leagues. He was college educated, grew up in a neighborhood of mixed ethnicity where he was accepted. That he also had a fire to win and to be the best is what matched the person that was in the heart of Branch Rickey. It was the heart of a man who would do whatever it took to prove himself the best - and that meant dealing with the hatred and prejudice, which would be used to show that black men were not ready to play in the major leagues.<br />Jackie had that fire and endured far more than many other men could have. In fact, several Negro leaguers who joined him that inaugural season on the Dodgers farm team in Montreal could not take the pressure and quit. Through it all Robinson persevered, turning when in doubt to the council and advice of Branch Rickey who Robinson throughout his life respected.<br />Because of this, Jackie was able to swallow the insults, the pain, the prejudice, hate, and his own bitterness - at least until it was clear that the game had truly been integrated and could never go back. Then he became very vocal, outspoken and to many minds militant and antagonistic. It was that desire for betterment, not just of himself, but also for his race that drove him - despite the resentment of many black men who did not want Robinson speaking for them.<br />Still Branch and Jackie took those initial steps together and they admired and respected each other from the day they first met. They made history happen and while each may have had their own motives and walked their own path afterwards - the story of how their lives came to intersect and their need for each other is a fascinating one.<br />This is a book any baseball fan will enjoy although it's not as much about the action on the field as it is about what went on off the field and in the minds of the two men themselves.	2003-06-20

The new forward by Hall of Famer Monte Irvin underscores the history lesson that none of us should ever forget: Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey made Michael Jordan and Jim Brown and Wilt Chamberlain and a host of other African-American athletic superstars' careers possible. <BR>Sure, the color line was bound to fall at some point, but this story is more than just a case of being in the right place at the right time. As Frommer details in Rickey and Robinson, Branch Rickey spent years planning the 'stunt' he pulled on 15 April 1947. He had a seven-step plan that started way back in 1943, that had been carefully orchestrated, with the player painstakingly chosen, at the expense of great financial and other resources, to maximize the possibility of the Experiment's success. <br />Frommer's book outlines not just the events of the meeting of these two men, but starts you out with their respective upbringings, their backgrounds and histories, so that the reades has the feeling that he has at least known, if not lived, some of the joys and hardships of these two mens lives even before the events that would forever associate their names int he record books. You get to learn about Robinson's family history in Georgia, and upbringing in southern California, as well as his exploits in collegiate sports and the Negro leagues. You get to learn about Branch Rickey's country bumpkin background, his religious and political convictions, and his achievements in St. Louis before he ever came to Brooklyn. You even get to learn what each of them did after they left the Dodgers organization, how their passions drove them to strive for what they believed in even when most ordinary men would simply have conceded to diabetes, or retirement. <br />For that matter, you may get a little too much in the way of details. Make no mistake, Frommer's thorough and engaging research is a trademark of his work. His quotes from Rachel Robinson, Roy Campanella, Walter O'Malley, Irving Rudd, Mal Goode, Pee Wee Reese, Monte Irvin, and so many others help the reader to feel like he's getting a first-hand account of the events from those who lived them. Heck, I guess you are. But if you start reading the book hoping only to learn what Jackie's first year was like, you'll be in way over your head. Besides, you should know better than to think that Frommer would leave you with so truncated an account of such a significant occurrence in American History. Shame on you. <br />The book, as always, is well written. Eloquent without being excessively verbose (I suppose I could learn a thing or two about writing from Frommer myself!), Frommer is nothing if not a great author, and shows no disdain for the vernacular. But he also has a sense of the importance of his subject, and does not leave stones unturned where there are questions. He doesn not play up mythological events (like Reese's alleged gesture of freindship toward Robinson in Cincinnati) and does not seem to take a side on most of the political and personal conflicts depicted in the book. In all, this seems a fair and even-handed account, if not without Frommer's (also trademarked) slant toward new York sports. Can't say that I blame him. <br />Now more than thirty years after Robinson's death at the age of only 53, more athletes, not just the black ones, would be well served to remember the debt they owe these two great men. <br />Reading Rickey and Robinson would be a good start.	2003-05-19

From the introduction by erstwhile Yankee rightfielder Paul O'Neill to the pages of famous and infamous quotes, to the lists of firsts and feats and statistics, Harvey Frommer's A Yankee Century ... is a joy to read. Frommer includes not only the accomplishments that have made the Yankees the most successful franchise in the history of professional sport (26 World Series titles, more Hall-of-Famers and retired numbers than any other team) but also the more dubious accomplishments (the embarrassing last-place finishes, off-color quotes and pre-mature trades, especially early in the Steinbrenner Era). The book allots the reader a view from almost any imaginable perspective: A timeline and a separate list of memorable moments, to review the details of specific occurrences; a history of Yankee Stadium, the shrine at which every New York boy's major league hopes are or were once laid; a who's who and discussion of the best and worst teams, the heroes every kid growing up around the Big Apple idolized; even lists of nicknames, significances of certain numbers, and a 100-question Yankee quiz. (I got a 72% - pretty sad - but I'm gonna study and re-apply next week!) <BR>What This Book Is: A Yankee Century is well written. An Ivy-League professor, who ought to be able to convey his thoughts well, Frommer makes the book enjoyable by making it simultaneously eloquent and readable. Its sections fall in more-than-manageable chunks, making it easy to read through, or to take in small sections, as time allows. Like, in the bathroom, for instance. Numerous black and white photographs grace the pages, adding to the sense of nostalgia, reminding you both how handsome Mickey Mantle was and how funny Bernie Williams looked with those big old square glasses. It even contains nifty little surprises like a dictionary for interpreting Casey Stengel's verbal diarrhea and the entire text of Mickey Mantle's Hall of Fame acceptance speech. My wife will tell you that I know everything about baseball and about the Yankees (She's wrong, of course, but I like to let her believe it) and even I learned a few things from A Yankee Century. <BR>What This Book Is Not: Frommer seems to know quite a lot about baseball, both from the historical/human interest side and from the statistical analysis side of things. While he uses and cites a lot of numbers, this is not a sabermetric book. Only occasionally does he make reference to things like slugging percentage or home run ratio, but of course, this isn't necessary for such a work. Despite the great B&W photos, this is not really a picture book. The focus is much more on the writing, and the liberal but tasteful use of pictures never becomes overwhelming. <BR>A Yankee Century makes a great coffee table book for the old Yankee fan to reminisce, the young Yankee fan to marvel, or the aspiring baseball fan to help solidify his choice of the greatest baseball team to follow in history.	2003-02-25

I played baseball at Rutgers University and also played a couple of seasons in the Cubs farm system before hanging up my cleats for good.<br />I moved to Boston about 3 years ago when my wife and I got married.  The thought of living in the shadow of the Green Monster was not initially appealing, however I love heading out to Fenway to cheer on the visiting team.  I typically catch 7 or 8 of the Yankee/Sox games each year and another 15 to 20 additional contests. My wife recently purchased A YANKEE CENTURY as a Christmas gift.

Frommer quotes Joe Jackson: &quot;I never said anything about it [the plot to throw the Series] until the night before the Series started.

BASEBALLOGY.COM	New York Yankees are the most popular, successful and enduring franchise in any sport. With all the amazing history that they have, can it be summed up in one book? The answer is no but this book does a great job of giving you a lot of their history in one book.<br />The beauty of this book is the little things, the attention that Harvey Frommer gave each page and each section. He listed so many facts in this book that any baseball fan would find this a great read.<br />The book has great quotes, timelines, short stories, player bios, full breakdowns of great records like the Joe DiMaggio hitting streak and when Roger Maris broke Babe Ruth's record (the breakdown of Ruth's 60 is in the book too!). The quotes are great too and there is a lot of information in this book that has never been seen before like Mickey Mantle's Hall of Fame speech!<br />The nickname section is priceless and all of them are explained in good detail. The pictures are well above average too as you will see a younger Casey Stengel, Thurman Munson, Ruth, Mantle, Maris, and Mel Allen. That's right even the great announcers that have worked for the Yankees over the years get their moment in the sun too.<br />Expect a lot of Billy Martin mentions and Yogi-isms in this Yankee treasure. There are also mentions of movies and really anything that has happened to the Bronx Bombers like Yankee Firsts and Lasts. And this book even has every manager to ever put on the pinstripes.<br />This book will cost you just over twenty dollars, but for the money you get a ton of baseball knowledge so it is well worth it.Buy A Yankee Century Now	2002-11-27

They have boasted such legendary performers as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Whitey  Ford, and Reggie Jackson. Those great players and teams can all be found in  The New York Yankee Encyclopedia, the most complete record of Yankee  baseball ever published. From their humble beginnings in 1903 as the  Highlanders through nine decades of unforgettable players, teams, and  classic games, noted baseball author and historian Harvey Frommer has  compiled everything about the history and lore of this fabled club in the  one book no true Yankee fan can afford to be without.	2000-07-12

NINE, Journal of Baseball History	Harvey Frommer has attempted to dissolve the mystique that surrounds what is commonly called the Black Sox scandal - - the &quot;throwing&quot; of the 1919 World Series by the Chicago White Sox. Frommer has done an  excellent job of presenting the facts of the case including the complete  grand jury testimony of Joe Jackson. He then lets the readers make their  own judgments. For those who are knowledgable of this affair, Frommer's  book will fill in some gaps and buttress previous readings. Is Joe Jackson,  arguably one of the best players of all time, being unfairly kept from  entering the Hall of Fame?  Harvey Frommer's book, as it illuminates  history, will help settle these questions.	1999-07-03
