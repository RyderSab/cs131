This book follows two sisters, Shana and Ali.  Ali is part of the Navy, and when the Navy sends her overseas, Ali reminds Shana that she had put down her name as \\"support person\\" to take care of her daughter Jasmine, in this contigency.  At the time that Shana had agreed to put her name down, it had seemed to be only a technicality, as it did not seem likely that she would ever be needed, but things change, and now Ali reminds her of her agreement. <br /> <br />The timing could not be worse.  Shana has just broken up with her five-year boyfriend, and, as a gesture (to herself) that she is starting a whole new life, Shana quits her job, moves to another city, and buys a pizza parlor (a major career change).  A little girl is exactly what she does *not* need right now.  In the end, though, everything works out, and as they tend to in romance land, everything works out much better than anyone could have hoped for.   <br /> <br />I had just read some of Debbie Macomber's older books, and I thought that this book felt more contemporary (DUH ME!!) - I thought that there was more of an *edge* to her characters than I've seen in this author's older books.  (Shana spends a major part of the book *breaking up* with her old boyfriend - even though, as she keeps saying \\"I am SO over him!\\")  I guess Debbie Macomber has updated - although, even with the more savvy and street-smart Shana, I thought at times that she *was* a little bit too good - she's always so polite, I kept waiting for her to *really* give it to him, which she never did.  I guess even city girls in Debbie Macomber's books are still sweet girls, at heart. <br /> <br />There was not as much emotional depth to this story as in some of her other books, but on the other hand, it was fast-paced, never boring - an enjoyable, and quick, read.  And, yes, I did think that the nine year old was pretty mature for nine - but not overly so, a very mature nine year old *could* pull it off, and I guess that perhaps Jasmine had grown up quick. <br />	2005-09-30

It was a great story, the characters were real, with emotional depth, and the pacing was great - everything was just right, and I enjoyed this one very much. <br /> <br />This is a classic we-made-a-baby, now-we-must-marry, storyline, and this one is hard to do well, and even harder to do well and realistically in a contemporary setting, yet in this story, Debbie Macomber manages to really make it work.   <br /> <br />Hannah is a minister's daughter.  She was engaged to a wonderful man, but he has just died, before they could marry. Angry, sad, and bitter, Hannah meets Riley Murdoch in a set of unusual circumstances, and, in a wholly uncharacteristic gesture, she throws herself at him.  When Riley realizes that this is her first time, he tries to talk to her, but she disappears before he can get any information at all.  Riley tries to find her - but without even a last name, it is pretty hopeless - until, Riley meets her in an unexpected way - at the other end of the *metamorphical* shotgun.  Forced into a marriage neither of them wanted, do they even have a chance? <br /> <br />This story was done exceptionally well, we feel both Hannah's and Riley's very real reservations, their very real and realistic emotions, as they have to work out what they *really* want - and how they will get there.  I loved this story especially because it was about two people who are trying to do the right thing, about two people who both try - eventually - to rise above their anger and bitterness to try to create something beautiful, meaningful - and lasting.  And, at the end, isn't that why I read romance?	2005-09-30
US	34914255	R13EU7FA2BM9NU	0451210085	995563689	The Scandalous Widow (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	I thought this one was *very* well written	Take a likable, intelligent heroine; take a mature and handsome hero; add some really excellent writing; and what do you have?  A really good Regency.  I enjoyed this one a lot - it may not have been the best book I have read - but IMHO, this is as good as a Regency is going to get. <br /> <br />This book started off somewhat slow for me - as we watch Lucian dancing with his mistress in Almack's, I actually groaned, no, not again, not another dance at Almack's, not another mistress!  But after the first few pages, the story took off, and I found myself enjoying it very much.  True, the storyline itself was a bit predictable, but the writing was so good, and the interactions between the h/h made up for that deficiency.  (And anyway, all the plots have been pretty much used up, they're bound to be predictable, eventually). <br /> <br />Lady Catherine Granville, after being widowed and displaced by the *new* Lord Granville, decided to use her remaining money (inherited from a great aunt, *not* her deceased husband) to open a school for young ladies, and yes, she is doing very well.  Her school has gathered some reputation, but most important, Lady Catherine feels fulfilled in her new life.  The *new* Lady Granville, current mistress to Lucian, the Marquess of Charlmont, is afraid that Lady Catherine's school will jeopordize her chances of being accepted in polite society, and she begs Lucian to somehow convince Lady Catherine to accept her true position in society, close down her school so as not embarrass her relatives (!!!).  Lucian agrees to *try*, but when he meets Catherine he realizes that she is not who he thought she was, and she realizes that *he* is not who *she* thought he was either - both have changed their names since they last met - and both are shocked and embarrassed at their re-meeting.  For they had been on the verge of announcing their engagement when Lucian left the country - with someone else. <br /> <br />I did *not* think that it was strange, BTW, that he left so suddenly, without telling Catherine - people do all kinds of strange things in real life, but this one is actually easier than most to understand - kind of hard to explain to your almost-fiance that you're going away with this beautiful actress but it's *really* not what she thinks it is - perhaps these two were too intelligent for that kind of farce. <br /> <br />This was an intelligent Regency, with two very intelligent protaginists.  I sensed in this story overtones from both Pride and Prejudice (two extra-ordinary people who are so very well matched) and Gaudy Night by Dorothy Sayers.  Two very good books, so I'm not complaining. <br /> <br />I agree with the previous reviewer that this one has a more authentic \\"feel\\" than most regencies being published today, and it's a good book, too, so... I would recommend this one. <br />	2005-09-15
US	34914255	R757F9N1IP53F	0380814382	658316423	True Confessions	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Great! - as usual!	TRUE CONFESSIONS is a very different style than the first Rachel Gibson I read - TRULY, MADLY YOURS - and it is also somewhat different in style from SEE JANE SCORE.  From what I have seen so far, Ms. Gibson changes everything for each of her books - SHE doesn't churn them out by formula.  On the one hand, that means that you get a different read each time, but on the other hand, that also means that one might be more to your style than another.  Luckily for me, I enjoyed TRUE CONFESSIONS very much, and I enjoyed the others that I read (so far) as well.  This one was a more lighthearted read, but that doesn't mean that it's not a good book, or even that it's not as good as the others.  Just different, and if you can adjust yourself for a different style, then you can enjoy this one as well. <br /> <br />The plot is fairly basic - career woman comes to small town to recuperate from \\"writer's block\\" - presumably to *rest* and get her creative juices flowing.  She meets the town sheriff - who, by coincidence, of course, is also fabulous, handsome - and single.  Did I mention that she's thin and beautiful?   <br /> <br />This is a plot that's been done to death, and frankly, I generally find it kind of boring (what's romantic and unusual about \\"gorgeous model meets really handsome sheriff?\\"), but it's the way it's written that earns every one of the five stars I rated it.  Ms. Gibson seems to be able to do any style of writing well, and here, where the book is meant to be lighthearted and funny, it is *really* lighthearted, funny, and enjoyable!  The dialogue is fabulous, the dialogue alone is worth five stars, but the story and the characters, are definitely well done as well. Absolutely recommended for anyone looking for a really fun read! <br /> <br />	2005-09-13

So that while other reviewers rated this book five stars, I could not rate this more than three, as it was a really average read for me. <br /> <br />You know when you have all the right ingredients for a cake, you follow the recipe exactly, and it flops?  Well, that's what I felt when I read RAVEN'S VOW.  This had all the ingredients for an excellent read, but somehow, something happened in the baking, and the *spark* that makes you want to keep reading was simply not there for me. <br /> <br />Perhaps it was the writing.  While sometimes Ms. Wilson does an excellent job, here I thought that it was a bit overdone, too many sentences, too many big words, too many times describing the way the hero smiles, etc.  It just dragged because she took so long to get to the point. <br /> <br />Or perhaps it was the hero.  While he comes across well, the whole premise of a half-Indian marrying a duke's daughter in Regency England - truthfully, I can't see it happen even in today's relatively lax standards - imagine how it would have looked two hundred years ago!  I know romance novels delight in these kind of *impossible* setups, but I think that the more outlandish the plot the better the writing has to be to back it up, and I didn't find that here. <br /> <br />Oh, well.  Nothing personal, we just didn't hit it off, I guess.  I did like some of her other books, however. <br />	2005-09-13
US	34914255	R39JHBYGKJ8GM1	0553113410	881747684	Miss Philadelphia Smith	Books	5	5	5	N	N	This was a REALLY great book!	I have no idea why this book (or this author) was never reviewed on Amazon.  I picked this one up not expecting too much, but as I started reading I found myself glued to the pages!  I can only describe this as a *real* book - the characters are really true-to-life, the writing is very well done, and the story is so vivid that it will stay with you long after you turn the last page.    I lent this book to the next person, so I don't have it in front of me, so I may not have all the names right.  This story is set in the eighteenth century - 1740's - and, while I am not a history scholar, it did have an authentic ring to me.  Philadelphia Smith - for that is our heroine's name - lives in a shabby genteel little house on the odd side of the street.  Her's is one of those funny streets where the rich live on one side in their grand houses, and people like Philadelphia and her mother live in cottages on the other side of the street.  As the class difference in England, especially at that time, is very huge, they might as well live on opposite planets, if not for the fact that sometimes, by peaking out of her window Philadelphia watches the *grand* people as they come and go, and wonders about them... especially the tenant directly across the street, a handsome and dashing young man...    Unbeknowst to Philadelphia, he has been watching her as well, and wondering, perhaps not as often, about Philadelphia.  He sees that her mother is ill, he sees that she has one suitor - exactly one - who comes once a week for exactly an hour, and he wonders, and perhaps pities a bit, how a beautiful girl like Philadelphia can be so limited in her life.    Everything comes to a head one night, and everyone gets mixed up in a way that would, in the normal course of events, seem impossible, and the reader is left to wonder if these two young people can indeed cross over the great divide...  Enter the young man's friend, Freddie (for some reason *his* name I remember - why do we always remember the villain of the piece?) who decides to do some mischief of his own... Enter Philadelphia's sister - another semi-villain... and we are left with a mix of all the right ingredients for a truly dramatic few days....    Without giving away the ending, it is hard to explain why I found this a good book, but, I for one, thought that it was a right ending, and realistic (if a bit \\"old style\\").  Others may disagree with me, but I liked it.    While I enjoyed this book very much, I found, when I lent it on, that it is not to everyone's tastes.  This is a bit slow paced and introspective, but it has it's dramatic moments as well, and the character analysis was as well done as any that I have ever seen.  For those who enjoy those kinds of books, I think that \\"Philadelphia Smith\\" is sure to please.     I recommend this book highly for anyone looking for a very high quality read.  I cannot call this a Regency, I think that this is set, rather, in the Georgian, or pre-Georgian (is there such a thing?) era, and indeed, this story would never even have started in the more rigid Regency era.  So... if you are looking for a really good book, very realistic and vivid characters, this is the book to get hold of.	2005-09-13
US	34914255	R6I5F3657H3IF	0440241049	880815333	Slightly Married	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Barely four stars...	And only because of Mary Balogh's superior writing style, and the Duke of Bewcastle (HE's really something).<br /><br />Although a little late to this series, I started this one with high expectations.  I felt that I was let down, as Mary Balogh has done, in the past, so much better.  This was a standard \\"lose the family inheritance\\", \\"marriage of convenience story\\", and, since I never warmed up to the characters, I found myself less than satisfied as I turned the final page.  Correction: I liked Eve, but Aidan never made it to my screen.  It is constantly emphasized how big and clumsy and wooden he is, and I never got the sense that he changed in any significant way.  I did not see him opening up emotionally to Eve, at all, and even the scene at the end felt to me, like too little, too late - I simply could not feel that this couple had a HEA - perhaps down the line, that I could believe, but when I'm reading a *romance* fiction book, especially by Mary Balogh, I don't want to have to imagine it, I want to see it happening!  (Are we to get more in subsequent books?)  I also felt that what Eve was feeling was rather flat - or that Ms. Balogh didn't describe too much.  It was - okay, it's okay, it's okay.  C'mon, she's a human being - surely she had some emotions too?  And I certainly didn't see her emotions at the end, how did she change in her feelings towards him?  (NOT that he gave her any reason to do so.)<br /><br />The only part of the book which I felt *really* sparkled was the Duke of Bewcastle's dialogue.  Oh, boy, this man is really something!  Although I cannot like him, at least in this book, I have to respect this man's intelligence!  (And by definition Mary Balogh's as well).  If you can write that kind of word play - WHY is the rest of the story so ordinary?<br /><br />This was a pretty bland read to me, if this is your first by Mary Balogh, I suggest you read some of older ones to see what this author is *really* capable of.	2005-09-13
US	34914255	RRZU06W191URM	0515114316	619711438	Marrying Stone	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Extremely well done!	I would be hard put to remember when I enjoyed a book so much.  I have read some of her newer, more contemporary novels, and while I enjoyed them, I have to say that \\"Marrying Stone\\" was in a completely different league. <br /> <br />This is historical fiction at it's finest.  Although this story started off slowly, a realistic cast of characters and a tightly woven plot soon had me fascinated, and turning the pages as quickly as I could.   <br /> <br />Set in the Ozarks, at the turn of the century, Mr. J. Monroe Farley is on a fact-finding mission - he has come to this backwards country to find old European ballads - hopefully, because of the isolated nature of this community, transmitted intact over the years.  Although he does find what he is looking for, he also learns a lot more than he ever bargained for.  Learning that can never be taught in universities - how to farm the simple way, for instance, or how to live on this simple, substinance level adequately, but especially, Roe learns something unexpected - this university educated, yet love starved boy finally learns about himself.... And something about love. <br /> <br />Meggie is a backwards country girl, but she is the *smartest* backwoods country girl for miles around.  Book learning is something she is good at, but if they had to live on her cooking everyone would starve - so it's no wonder she dreams about a magic prince - and leaving for a place where she would be better suited.... <br /> <br />Both Monroe and Meggie have a lot to learn, and learn it they do, through 300 + pages of bittersweet story.  Meggie and her father and her brother (Simple Jess) agree to help Monroe find his ballads through the countryside, but in return, Monroe has to earn his keep - and Monroe learns about farming, but mostly, he learns about the simple community - in a pocket of the mountains where time stood still... <br /> <br />While this story is set at the turn of the century, in many ways it seemed to me sort of like the Middle Ages, and it's possible that that is exactly how old this village is.  But the story itself was well done, with multi-layered characters realistically portrayed.  There is of course Meggie and Monroe, but there is also Meggie's father, her brother who was hit on the head as a baby and is therefore known as \\"Simple Jess\\", and I especially loved the old Granny - she certainly lent a certain spic- and some authenticity - to the story. <br /> <br />This was an extra-ordinary blend of well-researched history, sweet and well-fleshed characters, and an excellent, really excellent plot where everything about this novel is tied together with a flourish and a bow, this is a book that is head and shoulders above the rest.  It was obvious that this book was a labor of love. A pity that it's out of print. <br />	2005-09-13
US	34914255	R1ZCN47HM1RANQ	0821775073	383129876	The Captain's Mermaid (Zebra Regency Romance)	Books	2	6	7	N	N	This one really bothered me	I was trying to figure out why I didn't like this book, and other reviewers rated it highly.  You'd think that if a book is good, everyone would enjoy it, and if a book was bad, no-one would like it.  I think what it boils down to here, is that although this book was very well written, I found the characters, especially the \\"hero\\" to be extremely unsympathetic.  When you can't like the hero at all - well, there goes the romance, I guess.    This was a well-written and emotionally written, book  It seems that \\"The Captain's Mermaid\\" is a continuation to a series, but I did not read any previous books, and I was not at all lost - it seems that this book can stand alone.     Lavinia was brought up in Jamaica.  Now home in England, she is miserable.  England is nothing the way she thought it would be.  Oh, it might be for others - but she is living with her brother - and a more selfish person has never walked the planet.  He doesn't see the *need* to present her to society - what, and lose a perfectly good children's governess??!!  Lavinia takes stock of her life, realizes that at twenty-six not much is going to change, but she tries, stoicly, to make the best of things.  Contrary to convention she likes to walk around barefoot - who's to notice, or, at least, who's to care, anyway?  And when she sees a lake that is excellent for swimming, Lavinia realizes that, even though the weather is not quite like Jamaica, swimming here is still a pleasure to get her through her tedious days - and besides, she really does like her niece and nephew, so life is not all bad.    When she spies a young boy up in a tree watching her swim, Lavinia is livid.  Who's child is this that they allow him to do these kind of things?  When she discovers that he belongs to her next-door-neighbor, the captain who is finally home from the sea, Lavinia marches over to give the good captain a piece of her mind.  Turns out that this little boy has no parents, and the Captain is his guardian, a fact which awakens Lavinia's tender feelings, and she is determined to teach the Captain the right way to bring up a child...    The first few chapters here were quite good, even though a bit slow paced, but the interactions between the Captain and Lavinia really made me smile!  But it was when the story turned to romance (and the Captain's and Lavinia's courtship and marriage) that I found myself becoming more and more unhappy with this story.  I truly didn't like the Captain, which made it hard for me to root for their happily-ever-after.  I know that this is a popular story-line - strong, tortured, and unhappy hero is tamed by the love of the spirited, and strong heroine, but first of all, I don't like this kind of romance much.  Secondly, I've seen it done much better.  Third, I thought that a better name for this would be strong, tortured, *abusive* hero, and woman who's just willing (and strong enough?) to allow herself to be hurt (because she loves him?).    I didn't find that there was enough interactions between the h/h to make up for the character defects of the hero.  Sometimes, a skillful author can make you like this kind of hero anyway, by showing the reader his tender side (sometimes), or by having them make up, or the hero eating humble pie - but here everything was so rushed - they have one wedding night before the Captain rushes off to sea, and then they don't see each other for eight months, then he comes home, and the book ends there - there simply wasn't enough time, IMHO, for any kind of real relationship to develop, so I wasn't convinced that they had, indeed, found their happily-ever-after.    But with all that, this would have been a comfortable three star read for me, perhaps, if not for the way the captain's whip keeps popping up.  I wasn't extremely happy when, at the start of the book, the captain is seen to whip his charge (three lashes?), but I overlooked it, perhaps that's the way things were done then?  And he is a sea captain, and the boy seemed to like him.  (I don't believe that part, by the way, it's just not realistic - children may *obey* those kinds of parents, out of fear, but that they have a loving and open relationship?  I don't think so.)  But when we have a scene towards the end of the book - where the our heroine Lavinia, asks the Captain - will you whip me?  And he takes a full minute to answer before he says - no.  Okay, I know that he didn't actually whip her - but the fact that she's afraid of him, and has to ask that question, and he leaves her hanging for a while - sorry, this just did not go down very well for this reader.  I don't like romance stories where the heroine is afraid of the hero - and afraid that he might *whip* her!  Just ruins the mood, for me.    So, it's your toss.  If you like a story with a somber, emotional tone, and don't mind those elements that turned me off, then you will probably enjoy this book more than I did.  I give it two stars because it *is* well-written, and it does start off very well, and it *was* a good book, in its own way.  But not for me.	2005-07-31

I rated this book five stars, but that's because I only read the last two stories, and they were both worth five stars.  I don't normally read either Christina Dodd or Stephanie Laurens, and I didn't read those stories here, so I can't comment on them.   <br /> <br />Celeste Bradley is one of my favorite authors, (she's why I actually picked up this book, truthfully), and true to form, this story was excellent - and exactly what you would come to expect from Celeste Bradley - a *really* strong and unusual heroine, lots of twists and turns to the storyline, and most of all, lots of fun.  I absolutely *adore* strong heroines, so this story had my votes from the start.  It does suffer a little bit because of the length, this IS a short story, so it resolves quite quickly, but all in all, good enough for five stars. <br /> <br />This was about two twin sisters, Kitty and Bitty, Bitty is getting married, and Kitty is left out of the fun.  Until... Bitty gets cold feet at the last moment, and Kitty decides to try to save the day by pretending that she is Bitty... just for a *very* short time.  Truthfully, this plot has been done before, but this one was just done *so very well*, Kitty and Bitty are both truly hilarious (each in their own way).  If I had a complaint to make I would perhaps say that Kitty is a bit *too* strong in a heroine - but that's not possible (a heroine can't be too strong) so I won't say it.  When I mean a strong heroine, I mean it, I don't mean strong-until-the-man-comes-in-to-save-the-day.  Like I said before, this story suffers from the length, I would have liked to see more of a reconciliation at the end. <br /> <br />This was the first I've read of Leslie Lafoy, and I have to admit that I was quite impressed.  The writing was excellent, really, really unusually good, and there was a good storyline, plus character development, there as well.  This one also suffered because of the length -the dilemma the heroine finds herself is a hard one, and was resolved much too easily.  But even so, this was still a five star read.  I will definitely be searching out more books by this author! <br /> <br />I do enjoy these short story anthologies, because as a general rule I like short stories better than long ones (due to my time crunch - I hate waiting a few days to find out the ending of a story) and as a bonus, you get to find some excellent new authors.  And although some anthologies, are, to be blunt, somewhat stupid, this one was, IMO, definitely worth reading. <br />	2005-07-29
US	34914255	RNVCME78MB9IX	0380808080	316913360	This Heart of Mine	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Not her best .... but still, very good	SEP has never yet written a book that is not exceptionally well written, easy and fun to read, with true-to-life characters.  That said, THIS HEART OF MINE was not my favorite SEP book. <br /> <br />One thing you have to say about SEP, love them or hate them, the characters she creates are always vibrant and real.  In this book, I loved Kevin, liked all the secondary characters, but I really hated Molly. <br /> <br />I had read IT HAD TO BE YOU where Molly first makes her appearance as Phoebe's half-sister.  I was intrigued by this \\"poor little rich girl\\" and perhaps because I waited so long to read THIS HEART OF MINE my expectations were so much higher.  I was sadly let down here - Molly comes across as childish, unstable, and a little too attached to her older sister for a normal twenty six year old girl.  And, if SEP would not have told us that Molly has a near genius IQ, I never would have guessed.  Unlike Jane from NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE, or Susanna from HOT SHOT,  where these two genius women come across as, at the very least, a lot smarter than the average person, Molly comes across as a little stupid, if anything. <br /> <br />When I first starting reading \\"This Heart of Mine\\" and Ms. Phillips started describing Molly, I thought, oh, goody, she sounds exactly like me.  But then, as the story intensified and I got to know her better, I thought - I sure hope not!   <br /> <br />Let's start from the beginning.  Molly graduated from college, found a job as a journalist, found it boring, and quit to be a full time writer.  While fiddling with her \\"great American novel\\" she found herself writing a story about little bunnies, complete with illustrations.  Her books took off, but she is nowhere near a bestseller.  Now, since Molly so sweetly gave away all her inheritance money (now, those of us who never had more than a few thousand dollars in the bank at any one time may feel that this action was the very height of idiocy, but okay) she has to live on the sporaticincome from her books.  Now, here's the part that I don't get.  If she does indeed have such a high IQ, you'd think that she would realize that she needs, shall we say, a more stable source of income - now that she has no backup.  This is really not so hard - lots of writers have day jobs while their first books are taking off, and it's not like Molly has so many other commitments that she can't do that.  Plus, if she's really that smart, it shouldn't be such a challenge for her to work two jobs. <br /> <br />I also found Molly's attitude towards Kevin to be very puzzling.  She looks down on him because all he does is \\"football\\".  You don't need to be an intellectual genius to play football, she reasons. Um, and what does Molly do?  She writes children's books about bunnies.  Am I missing something here?  It doesn't take an intellectual genius to write children's books about bunnies either.  (Talent, yes, but then, so does football).  Um, Molly, let's take a look at ourselves first, shall we? <br /> <br />And I really hated the way Molly is so attached to Phoebe, and so dependant on her for every breath she takes.  Not only that, but she has modeled her life on being \\"just like Phoebe\\".   To the extent that she patterns her life on Phoebe's life - Phoebe did this, I have to do this.  Phoebe got married at a certain age, I have to get married at a certain age.  Phoebe got married this way, I have to get married this way.  Frankly, I found this aspect of her personality to be a little creepy. <br />  <br />Molly didn't want to be considered a \\"spoiled brat heiress\\", but I'm afraid that that's exactly what she is.  Most of us \\"plebians\\" who have to work for our money find that someone giving away as much money as she did, no matter what the motivation - well, it's something that those of us to whom money actually has some value will just not do.   <br /> <br />Last but not least, when I closed the book and re-thought the story, I realized that the way Molly is described in this book, and some of things she does, can only point in one direction - that Molly has some serious psychological problems.  Which were not fixed in this book.  Yes, it's true that Molly was trying too hard to be perfect that she had to let loose somewhere, but that's usually a sign of a very unhappy person.  Why doesn't the all-loving Phoebe take her for counseling?  Come to think of it, while I liked Phoebe in IT HAD TO BE YOU, truthfully, I hated her here.  She was simply so impossibly controlling, I felt like telling her - Phoebe, wake up, Molly is twenty-six, when are you going to let her grow up, make her own mistakes, live her own life?   <br /> <br />Also, I did not agree with the way that Molly was \\"fixed\\" in this story.  She's portrayed as being someone who has stifled the \\"real\\" her, and Kevin, with his daredevil ways, as being just the person to bring her out of her shell.  But, to me it sounded as if all the things Molly did were actually a cry for help, a neon signpost saying \\"I am not happy\\" - rather than an aspect of her personality that she is suppressing, and doing all the stuff she does with Kevin is not going to fix her underlying unhappiness...  but, as I said, that's just my opinion.  But - I may be wrong.  I don't have a psychology degree, so... just my own opinion. <br /> <br />Truthfully, I did NOT see what Kevin saw in Molly.  She treats him rotten, she's not particularly pretty, has an average figure, she's not even an heiress anymore, so that attraction is gone as well - she doesn't come across as this great catch in any way whatsoever.  And Kevin is just so nice to her - this is one of those few romances that I have read where I actually felt bad for the hero of the story (that he's not getting what he deserves).  And it's beyond me why everyone keeps telling Kevin that she's perfect for him.  Yes, he's really great for her, and he helps her a lot, but what does she do for him? <br /> <br />Like I said, I never met an SEP book that I didn't love, and this wasn't the first one, either.  I loved it, it was a really fun read, I just don't like the way some of the issues were dealt with.  And the secondary romance, which I always love in SEP's books, was exceptionally well done here as well.   And, like I said, love them or hate them, these were all real people.  I read this book quite some time ago, but the characters are still very vivid in my mind.  So, I'll keep an open mind, and I'll recommend this book, and who knows?  You may have a different reaction than I did... Oh, and if I were Kevin, I would be REAL careful with my money - hint to Kevin - please, please, do keep separate bank accounts...  <br /> <br />	2005-07-29

Some of these older stories are quite good, and THE GAMBLER'S BRIDE was a story that I enjoyed very much. <br /> <br />Miss Caroline Dysart is a boarder at Miss Harriet Minton's Academy for Young Ladies.  Although she is the daughter of a fabulously wealthy man, the term \\"poor little rich girl\\" seemed to have been coined just for her.  She is tall, thin, not very pretty, does not dress well, and is way over the age where she should have been presented - but it seems that her wealthy papa is too busy in India making money to worry about his daughter - if indeed he remembers that he has a daughter at all.  So poor Caroline languishes in her room at school, with no friends, except for a teacher, Miss Isabel, who seems to really care about her, and is always available to lend a listening ear. <br /> <br />Oh, Caroline!  Isabel is not who you think she is!  Isabel concocts a scheme to help her brother and boyfriend escape debtor's prison.  It involves a duplicity regarding Isabel - she proposes that her friend, Charles Montague, marry Caroline, but, of course, marry her in name only, because she has a scheme, a scheme that will make them all rich... and poor Caroline the unwitting dupe... <br /> <br />This all happens in the first few pages, so I am not giving away much of the story.  How this story actually develops makes for a very absorbing read.  Does Isabel win in the end?  How does Charles fit into this puzzle?  Since this is a romance, a happy ending is assured, but there a quite a few pieces of the puzzle that have to fall into place for that to happen.  This author seems to have a very polished style of writing, the story flows smoothly, the writing is good, and the characterizations are excellent (if a little stereotypical). <br /> <br />I give this four stars instead of five, because I thought some of the plot lines did not go anywhere, and were left hanging, and also, because parts of the story was a little slow paced, for example, we have pages upon pages ofCharles ruminating on how guilty he feels, and how sorry he is, I always like when a hero has a conscience, but it does get irritating to the reader after a while.  Although I did skip some pages along the way, all in all, this was an excellent story, and a first class read.	2005-07-25

Sometimes, when you find some of these older books, you are pleasantly surprised at the quality of the writing and of the storyline, and this was one of those times. <br /> <br />Viscount Grey has the biggest and the best stables in all of England.  As you would imagine, his horses are his first love, and take precedence over anything else - even the \\"coming out\\" of his two lovely daughters, Letitia and Julianne - ages nineteen and seventeen.  Upon the constant urging of his wife, Lord Grey hits upon a scheme that will make everyone happy - he will arrange a house party to show off his prize stables, and only invite the most eligible bachelors.  Everyone will be eager to see his famous stables, and, when they all come for the house party, his daughters will have the \\"pick of the crop\\", so to speak, since he has already screened these men, and invited only the most eligible.  This way, he will kill two birds with one stone - his daughters will be able to find husbands, and he will not have to go to London for the season - which he refuses to do! (What, and leave his stables for just anybody to take care of, imagine what could happen in his absence!) <br /> <br />Lady Grey, his wife, as might be imagined, is less than enamored at this idea, and, the book starts off with a conversation between Lord and Lady Grey, Lady Grey is stating her opinions in no uncertain terms!  She cries - they will be the laughingstock of the ton, everyone will know why only these bachelors were invited, everyone will assume that our two daughters are antidotes, and our daughters will lose any chance of marriage they might have ever had! <br /> <br />Lord Brerely, confirmed bachelor, gets his invitation in the mail.  By a series of unfortunate events, he accepts, before he realizes what the invitation is about.  Once his friends \\"clue him in\\" he is horror-stricken, and determined that even though he must go to this house party, he will be disagreeable as he could possibly be, no way will he be caught in the trap of matrimony! <br /> <br />The funniest part of this book is where Letitia acquires a pet raccoon - I guess you can say that the raccoon is what makes this story happen - and the situations the raccoon finds himself in, plus the situations where Letitia finds herself in because of the raccoon, makes for some very funny reading. <br /> <br />This is one of those stories where nothing major happens - no spies, no dead bodies, no disasters - just a sweet and funny romance about everyday living.  This is a story that is very easy to read, it is written with a \\"light\\" hand (similar to April Kihlstrom's style, I think), and there is constantly something funny happening in this wacky story about everyday life.  I really enjoyed it, and recommend this one for anyone looking for a light, funny, and very easy read, or a story about a pet raccoon, or if you were looking for a very old fashioned kind of story in every sense of the word (this is the kind of story that you can have no qualms giving to your younger child) - this book will be sure to please.	2005-07-25
US	34914255	ROC0EQ8UJZUV0	0821776215	897173628	A Love Affair For Lizzie (Zebra Regency Romance)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Oh, dear...	A better title for this book, would be, IMO - LIZZY GROWS UP - you'll see why if you read this book. <br /> <br />This is a very hard review to write.  LIZZIE'S LOVE AFFAIRS is an exceptionally well-written book.  There are so many elements that are in place for a really top-of-the-line, superb read.  The writing is exceptional, the characterizations are really, really good, the people in the story come alive, and the scenery comes alive as well.  Ms. Gedney is one of those rare writers who can make you feel what she is writing about - I actually *felt* Vienna, the setting for most of this book...  However, as the previous reviewers have mentioned, there are some very basic problems here, and it really is a pity, as this did have the potential of being a truly outstanding read. <br /> <br />Matthew and Lizzie have grown up together.  As they get older, they slowly fall in love, and they informally agree that they will get married as soon as Matthew comes back from the army.  Lizzie agrees to wait for Matthew to come back, and she has no desire or inclination to \\"see the world\\" herself - Lizzie is a \\"homebody\\" and is quite content to live abroad vicariously through her sweetheart's letters, until ... they seem to stop coming... and until.... The final letter where he informs her that he is now engaged - to someone else. <br /> <br />Lizzie develops a plan to go abroad with a family friend, not to win him back, you understand, but to show him what he has lost... <br /> <br />The only problem, and the MAJOR problem with this book, is the ending.  At about page 200, I realized that this author would need another 200 pages, at least, to finish up all the loose threads, and there are only 60 pages left.  Well, I was right.  Almost up until the very, very end, we have no idea how the book will end, when suddenly, she chooses, they get married, THE END.   Worse than the quick finish is the melancholy tone of the last twenty pages - not only do we not understand the ending,it doesn't even seem as though the AUTHOR understands the ending, she writes about it almost as you would a tragedy!  When you read a romance, you expect a happy ending, but this book does NOT have one.  True, \\"they\\" get married, but it seems as if even the AUTHOR was not sure of their \\"happily-ever-after\\" - she spends most of the book explaining why she CAN'T marry him, and suddenly she marries him?  Was this because this author was not sure how to end it, and just finished it off quickly?  Was it because she had a deadline, and wasn't finished?  Was it because she did not have enough length to explain her ending, and would have made more sense if she would have more time to explain it?  Or was it simply because, she had made herself such a tangle that even she herself couldn't see a way out for anyone to have a happy ending? <br /> <br />Truthfully, I don't know why the author ended this book the way she did, but I do know that if you were looking for a happy ending kind of a story, you will not find this a satisfying read.  And that's really a pity, because this book had all the hallmarks of a truly great book.  This book had almost everything else, I especially loved the way Lizzie is portrayed, as a real person, and how she learns about life, and how she changes throughout the book.  I also like the way this story came alive.   <br /> <br />But unfortunately, without a good and satisfying ending, everything else falls into the background.  Like I said before, that is really, really a big pity, because this book REALLY had tremendous potential.  This would have been a five star PLUS for me, if not for the very disappointing ending. <br />	2005-07-24
US	34914255	R3M16WZYXL0EW3	0821768433	538094232	Christmas Angel	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good book, but not really great, IMHO	While true to the Jo Beverley tradition - this was a good book, very well written - I did not find it as compelling as the first two books in this series - AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE or AN UNWILLING BRIDE.  But as they say, \\"to each his own\\", and this was still a very good read. <br /> <br />Leander is the hero here, and at the start of the book, he is definitely intriguing.  He feels he has to marry, immediately, but his reasons are private, even from his best friends.  Oh, and did I mention his criteria?  He must have a wife who will not fall in love with him. <br /> <br />He confides his dilemma to his friend and fellow rogue Nicholas.  He explains his dilemma, but will not explain his reasons.  Okay, true to form, Nicholas and his wife come to the rescue.  Enter Judith Rossiter, widow of the famous poet    .  She is known to have been overwhelmingly in love with her husband, and he with her, after all, most of his most famous verse was written to \\"his angel bride, Judith\\".  And she, too, is still mourning her dead husband, why else would she still be wearing widow's weeds? <br /> <br />When Judith Rossiter is suggested to Leander as the perfect solution to his dilemma, we get to watch the progression of this unusual and interesting marriage.  Why is Leander so determined to marry?  Why, too, is he so determined to hide his heart?  And what of Judith, and their two children - why does she agree to this suggestion?  And how will this blended family adapt?  How will Leander react to having an \\"instant\\" family, complete with two children?  And how will Judith react to this re-marriage? <br /> <br />Jo Beverley does \\"issues\\" very well, and in this novel, she examines the different pitfalls of a new and instant family - how the normal issues that parents have between themselves, and regarding their children, are now magnified 100 times over by the situation they find themselves in.  Many of their dilemmas were funny (and to those of us who have children, ring true to life).<br /> <br />While this book had a very good plot, great characterizations, and great dialogue, I was, in the end, disappointed because I did not feel that I got the insight I was looking for into Leander's character.  While Ms. Beverley does explain why Leander is the way he is, she never delves too deeply into his character, and I never got a *feel* of how he *really* felt, or why he was so quick to change, and why he fell in love with Judith so quickly.  People are shaped and molded by their childhood experiences, and they turn into who they are because of their life experiences.  Can people really change their underlying psychological underpinnings so shortly, and in so dramatic a way?  IMHO, this was not explained well at all, or at least, was not delved into adequately enough for me.  That is the only gripe I have in an otherwise excellent book - but it is a big gripe, because reading about how people react and change is one of the reasons that I do read these kinds of books. <br /> <br />But all the same, this was an excellent book, with all Jo Beverley's usual trademarks.  An excellent plot that is beautifully tied together by the end of the book, very good writing, and excellent characterizations and character development - definitely a notch above most other writers. <br /> <br />Although I gave it four stars, this is in relation to the other \\"Rogue\\" books, which I thought were better than this one.  But still, I love Jo Beverley's writing, so I guess you could say it's really a four and a half stars. <br />	2005-07-24
US	34914255	R297TYOOW01TTC	0451139127	10238902	The Dreadful Duke	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Sweet and enjoyable	The previous review did a really great job summing up this book, and reviewed it very well! I agree with the rating, that is exactly right. I had bought this book at one of those sales, read the first few pages, and promptly put it down.  After reading this review on Amazon, I tried again, and was glad I did, because it did turn into an enjoyable read, and, although I wouldn't give it five stars, I agree with the previous four star rating.      This book was published twenty years ago, in 1985.  Styles have changed, and the tone of more modern books is usually more brisk and cynical in nature.  So, it took me awhile to \\"get into\\" the story, as it's written with a heavy emotional and (to my mind) overly dramatic tone.  That's also why I had originally put down the book after the first few pages, because I found it a bit unrealistic for \\"the Duke\\" to be thinking in such heavy emotional terms.  But, I found that as I got used to the tone of the writing, I was able to enjoy it.    Many parts of this book were excellent and well-written, but truthfully, parts of this story were a little slow, and it did drag.  However, the good parts, and the excellent characterizations outweighed the negatives, at the end of the day, for me.  One of the things I liked most were the Duke's thirteen year old twin daughters, they were written very well and some of the things they said and did were just SO funny!  Another thing I liked was how the \\"love story\\" was handled - so slow and leisurely that it would satisfy even the most picky reader!  I also liked the way this author showed how the Duke slowly got to realize that his children need a father - and this aspect of the story was even more relevant today than at the time it was published.  People's lives today are so hectic that it is easy to forget that children do need a \\"hand's on\\" parent - and human nature hasn't changed, this is even more relevant today than it was at the time this book was published.      I found it interesting that the twins' *terrible* escapades are so tame by today's standards - imagine, swimming in the lake!  (A private lake, don't forget).  A terrible thing to do!  One can only feel nostalgic for a time - if it existed - where this was considered a *terrible* prank!    This book seems to be part of a series - the beginning of this one hints to a previous book, while the ending hints to another one - about the twin daughters.  I have not read any of these books yet, however, so I can't comment on that.    This was my first book by Barbara Hazard, and I will be on the look-out for other books by this author.	2005-07-24
US	34914255	R11HEAZSTMHT54	0446613754	987333801	Say It Again, Sam (Warner Forever)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Did we read the same book?	Previous reviewers saw this book as a funny, lighthearted romp.  Maybe we were reading two different books, because this is not at all what I read.      Truthfully, from the cover and the title, you would get the impression that this is police/romance kind of book, with everything good and bad that that entails, and this is exactly the kind of book that it was.    This seems to be a second book of a series, even though I didn't read the first book.  This is a fairly standard romance plot - Ruth comes home, but it is with great reluctance, as she does not want to face a certain person; a person who she used to be sweethearts with, but they had broken up, a person who is now town sheriff.  Ruth hopes for the best, that she will not have to see him too much, but, as this is a romance novel, we are fairly assured that that \\"is not going to happen\\", and, true to our expectations, Ruth bumps into Sam everywhere.  She has to learn to face what happened, and what will happen, between them...  This a fairly standard plot, and although the characters were well drawn and the plot was good and well developed, it never turned into a great read for me, and here's why.    First of all, the romance between the h/h was simply not believable to me.  It didn't seem real to me that they had been so deeply in love as teen-agers, and, although they had now spent so many years apart, neither of them has changed, they can meet again and it is just like it was?  CAN one turn the clock back like that?   Also, the romance that they had as teen-agers seemed to be too, too overwhelmingly \\"storybook romance\\" to be believable to me.  Maybe I just knew the wrong kind of boys, but I don't remember any teenage boys of my acquaintance acting even remotely similar to Sam (at that age).  He seems to remember every detail of their time together, every detail about how she reacts, what her fears are - my goodness! are there really people like that?  I seem to remember teen-age boys being a bit self-centered - like, he would remember every detail of what *he* wanted, he felt etc. but about her?  So, this sort of jerked me out of the story.    But the main problem that I had with this book was that it was so sad.  Yes, the romance was beautiful (if a bit too beautiful to be realistic), but the main characters were the only ones who got even a remotely happy ending.  I hope that I am not giving anything away about the story by saying that nobody else has a happy ending, I'll just leave it at that.    For those of you who like a larger-than-life romance, and don't mind a more somber background tone, this book will please.  As for me, what shall I say, perhaps its just not my cup of tea.	2005-07-24
US	34914255	RYZHR9GV436KJ	0451207661	939661312	Dark Champion	Books	5	17	18	N	N	This one was very well done.	I don't usually like to read medievals - if they are realistically portrayed they are too dark, and if they are not realistically portrayed - well, I don't like unrealistic books.  But I love Jo Beverley, so I tried this one out. <br /> <br />As far as being realistically portrayed - that's a big yes!  As far as being a dark novel - that's a yes, too.  There are some descriptions that are so graphic... well, I don't usually go for that, but like I said, I love Jo Beverley, and this was only a small part of the book... It was worth it. This is a very realistic novel in every way, and Ms. Beverly does not shy away from describing every aspect of medieval life, whether that is something that will offend modern sensibilities or not.   <br /> <br />In fact, Jo Beverley doesn't shy away from exploring any issue at all, as you can tell from reading some of her other novels.  One of the issues touched on in this book is the role that religion played in midieval life, and the mindset of the people who lived in those times.    A large part of the plot hinges on the priest and the way his mindset affected the characters in the story, and that was absolutely realistically portrayed, and not only that but I have read many books set in the same era that bypassed this aspect of their lives totally.  It's hard to understand how you can write any kind of medieval book, consider yourself an historical writer, and completely ignore the religious aspect, but many other writers do do that.  Not Jo Beverley. <br /> <br />What I like about Jo Beverley is what I perceive to be her emotional honesty - this is someone who is very comfortable in her skin, and she is therefore able to examine all the human emotions - whether good, or bad - but never with a bias, she is always fair.  She doesn't say - this emotion is good, this one is bad - rather, she brings up her characters feelings, their thoughts, and she presents them to the reader - you make your own judgments.  I really like that in a writer. <br /> <br />I have one minor complaint to make about this book, however.  Jo Beverley writes with a certain respect for her audience - she's not one of those writers to rehash what she wrote three pages ago in case the reader missed it - she assumes the reader is intelligent and did not miss it.  She also does not spend a lot of time explaining why her characters do or do not do something - she assumes that you will pick that up on your own, as you read the story.  That's good, but also it has its drawbacks.  In this book, for instance, the whole last episode of the story - where the h/h are separated for a while - I have to admit I was somewhat confused about the whole story - as to why they both acted the way they did. Make no mistake, where Jo Beverley is concerned, there is always a *good* reason for each of her characters actions - it's just that she didn't explain it, and I spent three days racking my brains trying to figure it out. <br /> <br />On the other hand, this aspect of Jo Beverley's writing (that she doesn't explain everything, but shows you how the characters react and lets you make the assumptions on your own) is what I like best about her books.  But in this case, maybe because this story was set a thousand years ago, and I don't generally read books set in that time period, I was somewhat more at sea than I would otherwise be.  I would have liked, in this case, for her to explain how the mideival mindset towards *honor* works, and how it differs from the modern mindset of how we perceive things today - and how the hero's feelings of  \\"honor above all else\\" affected this story's outcome. <br /> <br />I finished this book with a renewed respect for this author - a respect for someone who has such a rare and complete understanding of the both the intellect and the emotions - kudos to Ms. Beverley!  <br />	2005-07-15
US	34914255	R3QZ5SE1BQLN60	0553585916	249728210	The Charmer (Seducer)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Excellent, excellent book - some small reservations...	In THE CHARMER, Madeline Hunter has honed her writing skills - I found this book to be exceptionally well written, the writing alone would be worth five stars, plus.  But there were some aspects of this story that grated on me, which is why I bumped my rating down to four stars. <br /> <br />Sophia has run away to Paris to escape the ghosts of her past.  She has created a life for herself there of sorts until her father died and she inherited the dukedom.  She is compelled to return to England to accept the title of Duchess, and the duties that would be inherent in the title, as her father's sole remaining heir.  Actually, Sophia does not feel at all compelled to return on her own, so that the Duke of Wellington sends his messenger - Adrian Burchard - to bring her back to England, and Mr. Burchard does it the old-fashioned way - by picking her up and carrying her there!   Now Sophia can no longer run away and hide, she has to confront her ghosts, ghosts both from the past and ghosts that are very much there in the present, including her growing attraction to Adrian which opens a Pandora box of its own... and from which she tries to run away from as well. <br /> <br />This story is well done.  The characters in this story are very real, the book is well-plotted, and Ms. Hunter has set this story in a time (1832) where the historical detail is very much a part of the plot of this story.  It happens that I have read many books set between 1750-1850, and many books that feature dukes, and not once has it even been hinted that dukes have any kind of power, or votes, not one book that I have read had explored the House of Commons/House of Lord relationship, and how the nobility feature in the world of politics at all.  (Truthfully, I still have a sketchy understanding of English politics, but this novel has piqued my interest enough that I will now do some research on this subject).  Very, very well done, Ms. Hunter! <br /> <br />I also found that Adrian's parentage was very nicely done, and very well explored, in a realistic way.  It IS discussed, and it is also one of the central plot themes, too. Also, it was realistic that one brother was kind to him and one brother wasn't - and the fact that Colin was decent about everything is not a question mark to me - they were at the very least half-brothers - they shared a mother after all, they should have had a strong kinship, they shared blood after all. <br /> <br />My favorite part of the book was when they are both exploring why their respective families - Sophia's and Adrian's - rejected them - and Adrian very calmly explains - I didn't mind it so much because I knew there was a reason behind their behavior - but it must have been much harder for you because they simply rejected you for no reason.  Well done, Ms. Hunter! <br /> <br />There were some parts of the story that I really did not like, however.  First:  Much of the story centers on Sophia's emotional weaknesses, and Adrian's manipulation of her, and ultimately \\"fixing\\" her.  Sophia comes across as a very needy, emotional woman, and Adrian comes across as the all-knowing, all-seeing savior - of the variety of \\"I always know what's best for you, even if you don't, and I will force you to do what's best for you\\".  Some people may like that kind of a plot, but it's just not for me.  More unsettling is the constant use of physical force - while the first time he picked her up - physically - and carried her where she had to go, it made sense, and flowed with the storyline, by the third (was there a fourth time?) I felt that it was just too, too much. <br /> <br />I was trying to think about what I didn't like this aspect of the story, and the word \\"emotionally controlling\\" came to mind.  Adrian is constantly telling Sophia what to do, how to fix herself, etc.  He may have been right, but even so, I feel it is simply too much for one human being to have so much power over another human being, to the extent that it happens in this story.  Like I said, some people may go for this plot theme, I didn't.  I like my heroines to \\"fix\\" themselves (okay, with a little help from the hero), but still, it would have been nice to see Sophia have done a *tiny drop* on her own.  But, that's just MHO.  For what it's worth. <br /> <br />Another thing that was unrealistic to me was the way they fell so deeply, so overwhelmingly in love so early in the story.  Besides for the fact that I had no idea what Adrian saw in Sophia (pity??  Her title??), it was just too quick for them to have fallen so deeply in love  - so quickly, and so completely, on such a deep, emotional level, it usually takes couples years to develop that kind of a connection.  Unrealistic or not, it did make for some very emotionally satisfying reading, though. <br /> <br />I also could not understand what exactly kept these two apart for the entire book, and why it was assumed by both of them that they could not marry, and suddenly, the book is at the end, and we are told - of course it doesn't matter to Sophia about his past, or about the fact that polite society will ostracize them.  If it doesn't matter at that point - then why couldn't it have not mattered a little earlier in the book?  What was keeping them from getting married earlier?   <br /> <br />Another thing - while the characters in this story were very real, and they both came very much alive to the reader (that part was well done), on the other hand I felt that they were forced into a mold to do and say things that their characters the way I perceived them to be would not have said and done.  In other words, the characters were very well portrayed, and while sometimes they said and did things that were realistic (indeed, very realistic), at other times it felt forced and contrived.  Such as when Adrian is talking to Sophia, helping her understand her past and her reaction to it - it felt more like a therapy session than a spontaneous conversation between lovers.  Adrian is always very careful in how he says things - he always says the right thing, always does the right thing - it it possible?  Perhaps it *is* possible, but not very probable, or realistic. <br /> <br />This book has a lot going for it - it is well written, well plotted, emotionally complex, with a lot of historical background and information.  It also has strong characters, and a very interesting and varied plot-line, which is very well wrapped up by the end of the book.   <br /> <br />This is only the second book that I have read by Madeline Hunter, but I do seem to sense a pattern here - extremely well-crafted and emotionally deep characters, along with a realistic sense of the time period.  In this book, the writing was exceptional, as well. <br />You will probably enjoy this story more, though, if you are looking for a top-of-the-line plus very emotional and beautiful read and don't mind a weak heroine/strong hero combination - so while this was indeed a very, very good book, this was not a keeper for me. <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

But when you have a book on your keeper pile, and have read it no less than five times, what else can it be? <br /> <br />I recently re-read REMEMBER WHEN when I was looking for a predictably pleasant and enjoyable read, by my favorite author.  And this book delivered - it was well written, sweet, and enjoyable, leaving me with a good feeling when I turned the last page. <br /> <br />And yes, I know, this book is not perfect by any means.  When I started reading the first few chapters I was sort of rolling my eyes - Diana was so, so perfect, that she is truthfully not a real person at all.  When I read those first few chapters I sort of cringed to myself.  And the story is MUCH too drawn out, even for me.   And the ending truly did come out of no-where - for three quarters of the book, we have a marriage of convenience, and suddenly they are truly married - and the reader is left wondering - where did this happen? <br /> <br />And yet...  Once I got past the too-syrupy-sweet first few chapters, I got so engrossed in this book, that I forgot that I already knew the plot by heart, and that I had read at least The characters became so real to me, that I felt as if *I* was experiencing the \\"happy ending\\" as I turned the last page - and, hey, isn't that why I'm reading these books?  I enjoyed the h/h in this story, Cole and Diana, very much.  Their relationship develops slowly and sweetly, and I found this couple to be a refreshing change to the usual fare of \\"I hate you, I'm attracted to you, but I really hate you\\".  In this too, this book is different from some of Judith McNaught's other books (mainly her historicals) where the entire book takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride.  No thrills here, and perhaps at times a bit boring and predictable, but oh, so warm and sweet!  I enjoyed it very, very much, even the sixth time around.  <br /> <br />I would love it if Judith McNaught would re-write this book to give more time to the developing relationship between Diana and Cole, but barring that, I think that I'll hold on to my copy for the meantime. <br /> <br />Thank you, Judith McNaught! <br />	2005-07-12
US	34914255	R1225VLWUBM0QR	0446300578	402906162	Loving Julia	Books	5	11	12	N	N	This was a REALLY good book!	One of the best historical novels I have ever read - <br /> <br />And I have read quite a few! <br /> <br />I was actually surprised that this novel was not more well-known - and not as universally raved as some other historical novels.  I suppose because this book was published so many years ago - twenty, to be exact - and because Karen Robards is better known for her contemporary/suspense novels that she has written in recent years. <br /> <br />I have to admit, I had this book on my TBR pile for quite a while.  While I did enjoy *some* of Ms. Robard's other novels, many of them are very much on the dark side, a no-no for me.  I had just picked up, and put down, two or three in a row that did not meet my specifications, so when I picked up LOVING JULIA, I was expecting more of the same.  Boy, was I in for a surprise!  This was a very fun, easy to read historical (it reads like a Regency, but it does not say anywhere in the story if this is a Regency or not) with an unusual storyline, and two excellent leading characters - what more can you ask for? <br /> <br />I was even surprised at how much of an true-to-the-period \\"feel\\" this book has - the characters talk in a realistic-for-time-period way, or at least it is definitely English (for instance Julia says \\"in future\\" instead of \\"in the future\\").  I am sure that there are some minor innacuracies, and there was even one big blooper which I cannot explain without giving away the plot, but all in all, if there were any more innacuracies, I for one, didn't catch them. <br /> <br />Jewel Combs is not a lady, she is an inhabitant of London's underworld - as far away from London society as is possible to be.  By a strange quirk of fate (and some good plotting by Ms. Robards), she ends up as \\"Julia Stratham\\" - but one does not turn into a society lady just by changing one's name, and \\"Jewel\\" has some heavy work ahead of her in order to fit into a \\"society lady\\".  While this part of the story is excellent in and of itself,it is the romance part that really makes this book shine.  Sebastian, Earl of Moorland, is everything in a hero that a romance reader could wish for - handsome (gorgeous, even), emotionally cold and distant, and best (or worst) of all - accused of killing his first wife.  <br /> <br />It is the relationship between \\"Julia\\" and Sebastian that really makes this book shine, and it is the unusual storyline, excellent, excellent writing, and really good characterizations and character development that make this book a level or two above the others.  This book simply has everything, a true \\"keeper\\". <br /> <br />Very, very highly recommended.  If you are a romance reader and have never read LOVING JULIA, I recommend that you get yourself a copy immediately!  <br />	2005-07-12
US	34914255	R2S3RN91GPMYCX	0738204501	714594101	The Ritalin Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You	Books	5	12	16	N	N	This is a MUST read!	We were in the process of getting our child diagnosed with ADHD, and, after reading all the \\"standard\\" ADHD books, I decided to read a book from the \\"other side\\" - I like to keep an open mind. <br /> <br />This is the first book that I have read by Dr. Peter Breggin, and I was impressed.  He has a name for himself as an extremist, which he is.  He also has something as a name for being cruel to children, which I don't think he is, I actually saw a  compassion and commitment for children and their problems. <br /> <br />Please let me explain. <br /> <br />He admits in this book that his perspective is a skewered one - that since he treats children who were hurt by Ritalin and other psychiatric drugs, and he sees the ones who have the worst side effects, some of them irreversible, he tends to have a negative view of Ritalin. <br /> <br />But what I really wanted to see was some alternative - great, Ritalin is no good, but what else is there?  You can't just take away a solution without at least giving us another solution!  And that is where I was, indeed, very pleasantly surprised.  He has a chapter on what to do to help your child without Ritalin, and it is inspired, it is genius.  It is hard to explain his method in this review, I couldn't explain it as well as he does, anyway.  I recommend this book just for that chapter alone.  And although his method makes sense, the proof is in the pudding - the proof is in the stories of children that he has helped, that he has taught to have self-control, and to be weaned off the medicine. <br /> <br />Now, I would like to put in my own opinion here, if I may.  Dr. Breggin is an extremist, and no extremist is ever 100% right.  His practice is comprised of children (and adults - although he brings no adult case studies) who reacted badly to the medication they received, and he helps the parents wean them off, etc.  In that case, it may be argued that he is really seeing only one side of the coin.  He is seeing all the patientswho had side effects, some of them *extremely* severe, and not seeing all the patients who were helped, and did well, on medication.  It may in fact be argued that the patients he is seeing should not have been on Ritalin in the first place. <br /> <br />I recommend this book, but with one caveat - take this as a warning, not as fact.  Not all children who take Ritalin have such severe side effects.  Many children who take Ritalin are helped, a lot, with almost no side effects.  In fact, some people that I know call Ritalin a wonder drug.  But, it IS a psychiatric drug.  While it helps tremendously for those who need it, the way that it is being prescribed today - almost like Tylenol - does not say very much for the way we are treating our children.  The side effects, when they are there, can be very severe, as Dr. Breggin says over and over again in his book.  So my recommendation is first, to make sure that your child really does have ADHD before prescribing Ritalin (you would be surprised at how quickly some doctors will prescribe it with little, or no testing), and second, watch out for the side effects.  Most doctors will not tell you what the side effects could be, and what to watch out for, which is why this book is so valuable in that sense.  I am also surprised at how many people I have met who say they were prescribed Ritalin and it didn't help.  Why in the world did they keep on taking a medication - a psychiatric medication - if didn't even help? <br /> <br />Parents should not be cowed by schools and doctors - if you are a parent, you know your child best.  And do not be frightened into giving your child medicine that you don't feel is right for him/her.  Also, people will tell you that you should start as soon as you can - the earlier the better, they will say.  That is simply not true.  Ritalin is not a cure for ADHD, it is simply a drug that will help symptoms.  Ritalin does not change anyone's brain long term, only for the amount of time that they are on the drug.  So there is no danger in waiting a while - a month - a year - to see if they will outgrow it without the drugs.  On the other hand, if your child is totally out of control (I find it hard imagining a five year old so totally out of control that he/she must be put on drugs, but I guess it could happen, although very rarely) then, yes, you must put him on drugs immediately! <br /> <br />This is, I think, the part that this book is missing.  True, Ritalin could have side effects.  True, most children who are on Ritalin should not be on it, and can be helped with Dr. Breggin's wonderful common sense.  But he totally overlooks a small, but essential, percentage of children (and adults) for whom Ritalin is absolutely a life-saver, in every sense of the word! <br />	2005-07-10
US	34914255	R1QUP4KI5MSLX4	1559724900	538357460	Maybe You Know My Kid 3rd Edition: A Parent's Guide to Identifying, Understanding, and Helping Your Child With Att ention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder	Books	2	20	22	N	N	I would like to explain why I didn't like this book...	and why I did not find this book helpful. <br /> <br />My child is now eleven, the same age as Mary Fowler's child is at the end of the book.  I picked up this book at the library because, after going through so many years, I thought it might be nice to see another parent's perspective. <br /> <br />Well, first it was nice to see that there is another child on this planet who is my son's twin! As far as behavior is concerned.  That was *nice* to read about!  On the other hand, her perspective is very different from mine on a lot of issues. She went a completely different route than we did - she had her child diagnosed with ADHD, and treated medically, and also she put him in a special program.  We chose not do any of those things, but not because we didn't want to deal with it, rather, we felt a different approach would work better.   <br /> <br />We did not want to go the medical route because we did not want to view him as \\"our child, the problem\\" and we wanted him to grow up normally.  What we did do was all kinds of natural stuff, such as allergy testing, sensory integration therapy, physical therapy, but we kept him in a school setting.  It was very hard, but we assumed that he would outgrow most of his more severe symptoms eventually, with lots of love, attention, and therapy.  We also kept him in a regular school setting, and asked the teachers to accomodate him, plus got him help with homework, tutoring, etc. <br /> <br />I am not saying that our approach is better, simply that it was the approach that we chose.  I don't think that anybody could make that decision for a parent, that is an individual decision that each person has to make on his own.  But when I read this book, I knew why I made the decision that I did.  <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Mary Fowler refers to her child as a \\"problem\\" child, with a terrible disease, ADHD.  And it is so hard to have such a child, and nobody can understand how hard it is to have a child with ADHD, it is just so impossible.  Well, I would like to say something.  My child had severe ADHD, and believe me, it was not easy.  However, in no way can the pain of having an ADHD child compare with the pain of a parent who has a child with cancer, for instance, or any other kind of severe medical condition.  To call ADHD a \\"severe\\" medical condition is simply not true.  The majority of the children with ADHD outgrow it as they get older, and almost all of them can lead normal, productive lives.   <br /> <br />And even the behavior problems of a child with ADHD... well, I know parents who have real problems with their children, they are totally out of control, and these children - Surprise! - do NOT have ADHD.  They may have anger management issues, depression - who knows?  There are some children who are harder to raise than others.  There are some children who really test every bit of patience that a parent can have.  And there are children who are within \\"normal\\" range, and parents still have a hard time raising them.  Even \\"easy\\" children come with their share of problems, too.  So the attitude of \\"poor me\\" my child has a problem, and nobody can understand how hard it is for me to have a child with such a severe medical condition, well, I just don't go for that, I'm sorry.  AND I am talking as someone who has gone through with my child everything Mary Fowler has, and more. <br /> <br />Sometimes we forget to remember the good parts of being a parent, the fun parts of just having a kid and enjoying him, sometimes we have to be reminded to just \\"enjoy\\" our children.  A medical diagnosis, in my opinion, makes it too easy to focus on their symptoms - and you are constantly thinking in terms of how bad was he today?  Is it time to adjust the medication?  And you become so focused on constantly cataloguing all your child's symptoms, and you are also constantly reminded - my child has a problem, my child has ADHD, every time you have to remember what to say to report to the doctor, the therapist, whatever.  And for me, by just focusing on my child as a kid, I think that it was easier for me, and easier for me to see all the good qualities that my child has, easier for me to allow him some slack (he liked to dig in the backyard all day? okay, some kids have more energy) and not looking at everthing he does as a symptom of a disease. <br /> <br />However, if the medical route is the route you wish to take, this book will be very helpful to you, as it has a lot of information as to what to do and where to go to get the most help. <br /> <br />But whatever you do, don't forget to sometimes just focus on you child's positive qualities (he has to have SOME positive qualities!) and just enjoy his childhood!	2005-07-10

I found this book on the recommendation of Amazon readers, and as usual, they were right on target.  I really, really enjoyed this book. In fact, I very easily read this book in one sitting.    This was a well-written, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, fast-paced contemporary, with very, very real characters.  Since my preference is for excellent writing and realistic characters, this book really hit the spot for me.    Although I do agree with some previous reviewers that parts of this book were a bit unrealistic, I think that the excellent writing made up for it.  (In other words, you can write anything you want as long as you can convince me that it might have happened, and Robin Wells does such a good job that I almost believed it - well - almost.)  For instance, Annie is five foot five, 115 pounds, and well endowed?  Is that physically possible?  Also, in the first few pages of this book, Ms. Wells describes a poor house as having a \\"smell of cabbage\\".  I remember reading somewhere that in \\"old\\" England, all the poor houses smelled of cabbage because cabbage was the cheapest food, I don't quite think that would translate well into twentieth century United States.... Also, the mix-up in the baby clinic is a very common plot (I have read at least three other books with this plot), hopefully this is not so common in real life as it is in fiction!!!  But I have to admit that Robin Wells did do it the best.    What a mix-up!  Jake has lost his dearly beloved and very much mourned wife Rachel two years ago, she was on the way to the fertility clinic for a procedure when the accident happened that took her life, and the life of both of her parents.  So not only did Jake lose his wife and in-laws in one sweep, he lost the hope of children as well.  Jake did not take this loss well.    At the start of this story, Jake is on his way to the fertility clinic because he has gotten a notice reminding him to come by to be a donor \\"again\\", Jake has a very uneasy feeling about the \\"again\\" and is determined to find out what exactly is going on...  What is going on is that he has a baby, and   is the mother.    Annie Hollister is living on the ranch she inherited from her grandfather, with her fourteen month old baby.  Although she is good with fortunes in the tea leaves, it's a pity she can't read her own, and doesn't know that her life is about to change in a most fundamental way...    I have to admit that the reason I gave this book five stars is absolutely because this book fits my personal preferences list so completely.  I like a story with more than one plotline, I like a story with a tortured hero, I like a story where the h/h are so obviously really not meant for each at the beginning of the book, I like a story where the hero is a decent guy who tries to do the right thing, but is also a real person, I like a story where the heroine is a strong person on her own, and I especially like a well-written, realistic story.  This book checks positive to my entire personal check list, and I loved it.    If any of the above are your criteria as well, then you are sure to love this book.	2005-07-08

This is a very different and original story, and one that a long time romance reader will likely find a breath of fresh air in the crowded romance market, and a welcome change to all those \\"alpha male\\" heros out there.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book.  What I enjoyed most about this book, I think, were the h/h - David and Christina.  I think Ms. Hunter's strength is personalities - these two do come across as real people.  David is an unusual hero - but on the other hand, he is also more \\"real person\\" as opposed to \\"made up for the book\\" person.  He is not particularly glib-tongued (although not at loss for words either), nor is he a \\"he-man\\", alpha male - his strength rather, is in his self-control, and his ability to know what he wants, and in knowing how he's going to get it  - self-confident, that was the word I was looking for.  Christina, on the other hand, is indeed the prerequisite young, nave virgin bride, however, she, too, was different in that in her maturity level, she is way above most of the other romance's heroine - in other words, she is not too-stupid-too-live, but rather, is intelligent, practical, with a really sweet personality.  She is also one of the rare breed of heroines who understands and accepts that she will have an arranged marriage (I always find it amusing when the heroine of an historical novel seems outraged and shocked at the idea of being married to someone that was picked out for her - that would be the way of life for them, wouldn't it - with the ones who marry for love the exception rather than the rule!) <br /> <br />I give this book four stars, however, because although the characters were absolutely wonderful, and every bit of dialogue was just right and perfect, I found the narrative a little stilted.  Maybe it's just me (probably it's just me because everyone else loved this book), but I found the reading jolting.  Maybe it's because my preference is for long, descriptive, run-on sentences, which this book doesNOT have.  Maybe it was because there was just a little bit too much background information (which I found boring). <br /> <br />Whatever it is, I did love this book and absolutely recommend it. <br />	2005-07-08

My expectations for this author were rather low, actually, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well-written and amusing this book really was.  It was certainly the kind of book that keeps you turning the pages.  I was even more pleasantly surprised to find that the characters do act - sort of - within the time period this book was set in.  This was my first by Amanda Quick, I have read some by this author's real name Jayne Ann Krentz, which were *okay* reads for me, but I found that the style of this author under the pen name of Amanda Quick was more to my liking - a little more sophisticated language with heavier emphasis on clever dialogue - and I just love well-written dialogue (with a sort of tongue-in-cheek style).   <br /> <br />I know that Amanda Quick writes by formula, but since this was my first by this author, the formula definitely worked for me.  I even liked the constant reference to \\"Vanza\\" - it gave the story a \\"mysterious air\\" which I enjoyed.   I was kept guessing and re-guessing where the story was going, and I was surprised at the turns the plot did take (and it took quite a few).  I suppose if I were to read them one after another I would not find the same level of satisfaction, but I'm not planning to do that, anyway. <br />  <br />My chief complaint is about Madeline.  Honestly, she personifies every single thing that I *hate* in a heroine.  Artemas tells her that he is going on a dangerous mission.  She says \\"you must take me along!\\" (See how strong and brave I am).  They start off their \\"dangerous mission\\" with Madeline saying \\"oh, how great, this is so much fun\\".  Then, when things actually start looking *dangerous* (!!!) Madeline says - \\"oh, I don't like this, it's not fun anymore!\\"   Then, they get stuck and Madeline says - \\"now we are stuck!  What do we do now?\\"  And ofcourse, Artemus bounces in and saves the day.  It makes one wonder *what* exactly Artemus saw in Madeline - or are men actually attracted to that kind of silly twatter?  And it makes me wonder what this author was *thinking!*?    <br /> <br />Oh, well, still, this was worth the read.  A fast-paced, plot-driven, yet well written book, with excellent dialogue - that's a rare combination.  Definitely recommended. <br />	2005-07-08
US	34914255	R1NUGL32N36FP7	0385338228	959811732	Simply Unforgettable	Books	5	8	10	N	N	I simply enjoyed this book...	Immensely.    Mary Balogh has written a lot of books.  I have not, as yet, read them all, but so far, this is one of my favorites, and I'll explain why - not because it is the best book she has ever written, but because, to me, it is such a \\"feel good\\" read.    I was expecting a slow start, (as I have found some of Mary Balogh's previous books tended to do), but this book actually gets into the action pretty quickly, and I loved the first few chapters.  The way that Mary Balogh describes the inn, for example, you can feel as if you are right there, you can almost taste the food!  And the dialogue between the two of them, the way the scene is built up - it was really enjoyable reading.  But then, when the h/h parted ways, I found it a bit of a let down, as not much happens for the next few chapters, however, a few chapters later it once again gains momentum as everyone is orchestrated into place for a beautifully executed finish.     SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE is the first book of what is to be a new series.  In this story, we are introduced to Frances Allard, who is going back to the boarding school where she teaches, after having been with family for the holidays.  A snowstorm soon overtakes her, and she finds herself stuck on the road, unable to get through the snowdrift ahead of her.  Someone else is stuck on the same road as well - Mr. Lucius Marshall, Viscount Sinclair.  Being stuck together, they are forced to share a nearby, but empty, inn.  He is of the aristocracy; she is a teacher, and must work for her living; - two people from opposite ends of the social spectrum, two people who would never in the course of things ever meet - yes, it is hate at first sight - but then, as they slowly get to know each other - is there something else as well?  And even if there were to be something else there - nothing can ever come out of it, could it?  They come from opposite ends of the society spectrum, something which in Regency times was quite a big line to cross.     Thismay have been a bit of a bland read, but on the other hand, sometimes that is what I am looking for - a nice, sweet story with a beautiful and accomplished heroine, a titled hero who is wealthy, handsome, and a little bit arrogant - a \\"fairy tale\\" kind of story - to balance out the more \\"dark\\" stuff that we are exposed to constantly. I know, this is not real life, but sometimes I do want \\"fiction\\" as opposed to \\"realism\\", and I sometimes even like my fictional h/h to be perfect, why not?  And I don't think that it was so impossible that Frances Allaird was an accomplished singer.  This is actually explained very plausibly, and this fact adds an added dimension to the plot.  And I don't think that she would have to practice for hours a day if she were not performing at the time of the story (it's obvious that she did practice in the past).     I do love these love/hate at first sight kind of storylines, it usually makes for some entertaining reading, and in this book, Mary Balogh does the situation to it's very hilt.  I found this book has some really, really good dialogue (and I love dialogue), something that not all of MB's books have - so that was a bonus for me. I thought the characters of Frances and Lucius were very well done, and well fleshed out.  They are both very definitely \\"real\\" people, in that they react in a very realistic way, and they both change, in their outlook, as the story goes on - one of Mary Balogh's trademarks, actually.  Mary Balogh always writes well, beautifully well, and some parts of this book were so absolutely beautifully done, that I think those parts were as close to perfection as is possible for a book to be.  I really, really enjoyed this story very much.    A previous reviewer mentioned that it seemed out of character for the hero to allow the Frances to sing even after they were married.  True, a husband of that time would probably not allow his wife to sing, and it would not have occured to either of them to even think of suchan arrangement, but this is fiction, after all, and a modern author does have to do some tampering with the facts to satisfy her modern readership.  I don't think was such a bad one either - it's not like she would be a shopgirl or something.    Was this book perfect?  IMHO, it was not. While some parts of the story were very well written, exquisitely written; some parts seemed to have been a bit rushed, and there were even some pages that seemed to have been there only to introduce the peripheral characters in this book as central characters for her next book - which was done very badly, BTW.  I also did not like that this book focused exclusively on the relationship between Francis and Lucius. I usually like a secondary romance as well, which Ms. Balogh very kindly provides for me in her previous books, but *not* in this book.    No, it's not perfect... yet I rated this book \\"five stars\\" because this book, for me was a keeper, despite it's flaws.  A book that I would like to have on hand, a book to counteract those days where everything is sort of blue...  I do NOT think that it should have come out in hardcover, however, and I found that very annoying.  I actually took this book out of the library, as I almost never buy hardcover (not in my budget), but I am waiting for the softcover version so that I can have this one for my keeper shelf.    Will you like this story?  Mary Balogh has written some very emotional, and angst-driven books.  Some of them, such as ONE NIGHT FOR LOVE and A SUMMER TO REMEMBER, were very highly rated by many Amazon reviewers, however, I, personally, found those two books to be four star reads, while this book was a five star read to me.  So, if you, like me, enjoy a book written on a \\"lighter\\" note, and you are looking for a story with \\"real\\" and complex characters told by a master storyteller, then you will definitely enjoy SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE.  Highly recommended!	2005-07-01

But much better than most Harlequin American books. <br /> <br />I picked up a pile of Harlequin's at a sale, figuring I'll give them a try.  Well, I went through at last five of them before I found one that I could actually read without cringing, and this was it. <br /> <br />Meg Avery thought that she was the happiest woman in the world.  Joe Avery had had an accident and lost his memory.  Clothes and papers found near the scene of the accident identified him as Joe Avery.  A background check turned up a drifter - a guy who couldn't seem to settle down.  But he had been on the way to take a job in the Back Door Cafe, where Meg worked.  He took the job, and Meg married him.  She was surprised at how responsible he seemed, when his reputation in the past was so bad.  Maybe a bump on the head wasn't such a bad thing after all? <br /> <br />Meg and Joe were traveling with their one month old Dana, when, at a rest stop, Joe suddenly disappeared with the car.  The car was found, but not Joe.  But Meg and Joe had been so happily married, and Joe doted on his little daughter Dana - what could have happened? <br /> <br />Two years later, Meg sees a picture of Dr. Hugh Menton in the paper.  He looks exactly like Joe!  But he doesn't remember her.  Can the doctor be her missing husband?  And why doesn't he remember their life together? <br /> <br />Jacqueline Diamond has come up with an excellent story, an excellent plot, and she plays it up to the hilt.  Maybe a tiny drop unrealistic, but compared to some of the other contemporaries I have read, she makes it sound *almost* like the story might have happened. <br /> <br />This is not an action oriented story, but rather a sweet and gentle story of a relationship that has to mended.  I really like the way this author writes, and she seems to have a lot of talent.  It's very hard to write about every day things and make it interesting, but Jacqueline Diamond does so in \\"Surprise, Doc! You're a Daddy!\\" <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this story, and I recommend it highly for anyone who is looking for a quick, sweet, yet very high quality read.	2005-07-01
US	34914255	R2DHI610PMBROL	0446325910	735259545	Libertine in Love	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Surprisingly, quite good!!	What do you do when you start to feel as though you have read every book, every plot line?  You can try for a fresh new author - or you can go backwards, and try an older book.  I tried this book on an impulse and was glad I did.  This book is best categorized, I think, as a Regency, just a little longer than your typical Regency (being published today). <br /> <br />First, for a word of warning.  Romance, as in everything else in life, seems to have certain style that is popular at a certain time.  So, by saying that this book was published in 1980, you can almost assume that the hero of the book would accost the heroine in the first chapter, that she would hate him yet be physically attracted to him, that she would \\"suddenly\\" discover that she loves him in the last chapter, he proposes, she says yes, and then the book ends.  If that was your assumption, you would be correct, as all that does actually happen in this book. <br /> <br />However, I still enjoyed it very much, and this is why: <br /> <br />First, it's done reasonably well.  I am a hard sell - in other words, if the hero is a rake, I am hard person to convince that he will actually reform, or at least make a good husband (I tend not to buy books that have the word \\"rake\\" in their title for that reason), but in this book I am indeed convinced.  (She actually uses an unusual plot device that I have heard Jo Beverley mention as original to her story, Emily and the Dark Angel). <br /> <br />Second, this book contains a lot of dialogue.  Chatty, entertaining, lovely regency dialogue.  Truthfully, my weakness is dialogue, and this book is chock full of it. <br /> <br />Third, this book has a lot of detail about the times of the Regency era - for instance, their clothing, what's in style, what's coming into style, what's going out of style, what is okay to do, socially, what is not - page after page of detail of how the ton lives, acts, dresses.   <br /> <br />I am not a Regency expert so I am not qualified tosay if it is all factual down to the tee, but neither am I a regency ignoramus, and nothing she wrote felt wrong, so my verdict is that it is accurate, for what it's worth.  Also, the fact alone that she spent page after page with tons of tons of details must mean that this author did quite a bit of research, at the very least. <br /> <br />Juliana has always lived with her father in the country, and although they were not poor, they lived comfortably and happily, but unfashionably.  Upon her father's death, Juliana is invited to her maternal grandmother in London, to present herself for the season.  On the way to London, Juliana and her chaperone make a stop in an inn, where they meet the hero of our story, the Marquis of Peterborough, who is \\"in his cups\\", and takes shocking liberties with our heroine! (of course).  Upon coming to London, however, Juliana soon realizes that society will blame her, while he will escape without a scratch to his good name.  Juliana therefore asks her chaperone to please keep this information to herself... <br /> <br />Juliana is coming from the country, and she is therefore seeing London the way we, perhaps, would see it, as she, too, is viewing the ton and society with a fresh and naive look.  As she is being taught - sometimes the hard way - how society operates, we, the readers, are getting a lesson as well.  This was an excellent plot device, I thought!  Indeed, I thought this book was well done in every way - decent writing, lots of detail, dialogue, and also, a very tight plot. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book very much, and I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a new (ahem) Regency author.  Very nice, and very sweet, if that is what you are looking for.	2005-06-28
US	34914255	R3TT38HMITJBZS	0451198352	619961628	The Misfit Marquess	Books	4	1	1	N	N	I really should have given it five stars to help with the ratings...	Why did this book get such bad ratings?    I liked this book very much, and was surprised that my sentiments were not shared by others.  This is a very well written, if at times a bit slow moving (hence minus a star), gothic romance, I thought it was a nice book, well done, with Ms. DesJardien's trademark excellent writing, a tight plot, and an h/h that you can come to care for.    Elizabeth is running away!!!  From where?  From who?  Whatever it is, it must be really dire to have a Regency miss riding a horse alone in the middle of the night!  When she sees a fire in the distance - good, she thinks, an inn - but when she comes closer, she realizes that the fire is just a little too large - a real fire! and not only that, the building is not an inn at all, but an insane asylum.  As Elizabeth stops to try to see what she can do to help, she is assaulted, her horse taken away from her, and she is left for dying, as well...    Where she is discovered by Lord Grayleigh of Grayleigh hall, who has a habit of taking in strays... When Elizabeth wakes up, she pretends to be from the asylum, and pretends that she had to take a rest for her \\"nerves\\", problem is, rumor has it that Lord Grayleigh is a little mad himself...    I don't see why a previous reviewer thought it problematic that Elizabeth pretended to be from the asylum.  She was trying to protect her identity, and she said the first thing that popped into her head.  I think that this is somewhat realistic - we don't always do our finest thinking while all drugged up with laudunum (a mixture of opium).      I thought this was a touching story about two people who, while trying to sacrifice themselves for other people, ended up finding happiness for themselves.  Ms. DesJardien, as is usual for her, raises some serious issues in this story, and while I don't always agree with her conclusions, it is nice to see the questions being raised at all.  And no, she does not bring Mary Jo Putney's understanding of madness to thisbook (as in the Wild Child), but Mary Jo Putney is in a class of her own; I don't think it is fair to rate anybody against the most brilliant romance writer I have ever read (MJP).  Also, in this book, madness is simply a backdrop for the story, MJP actually cures her heroine in the Wild Child, again, not something that an average romance writer could even attempt.  (BTW, while MJP does brilliant therapy in fiction, I wonder what her success rate would be in real life - probably higher than the average, but then, the average for talk therapy alone is pretty low).    Well written, but a little slow paced at times, a solid four stars.	2005-06-28

This book is worth getting simply for the first story alone!  If you are a fan of the beautifully written, yet farcical and tongue-in-cheek Regency story, then you simply must read this very beatifully written, and very tongue-in-cheeck story by Ms. Beck.  And the fact that it was so short added, rather than detracted from the story, as it was just the perfect length for this kind of story.    Lady Rettinger had decided to enlist her neighbor's help (the much-saught-after-in-the-marriage-market Lord Burton Dance) in saving her deceased god-daughter's daughter (the mother's deceased, not the daughter) from a fate worse than death - marriage for love.  But, unfortunately, they may both be too late as Gowland Delafield is cursed with the Bellefleur nose.  A must read!    I enjoyed this story very much, was sorry that it was so short, was even sorrier that it had to end at all, and I recommend it very, very highly.  Enjoy!	2005-06-28
US	34914255	R3TJFV34VLVO3K	0380714116	302024255	Madensky Square	Books	4	15	15	N	N	I was expecting a different type of book...	Having heard this book described as a romance, that was what I was expecting.  I think a better definition of this book would be a \\"love story\\", as considering a book a romance usually conjures up the narrow definition of what the romance genre is usually comprised of - two people who fall in love and get married (almost always), but especially, live happily ever after.  Well, this story fits only one part of the definition - the h/h in this story are certainly in love, but will there be a happily ever after?  So, this story sort of took me by surprise, but once I got over that, I did enjoy this book very much.  Besides, there are plenty of other characters who do get their HEA, and even Susannah does get a sort-of HEA, so I guess it sort of fits into the romance genre. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book, exceptional in every way.  Eva Ibbotson has a way with words, and a way of describing her characters, that every scene, every person, comes vividly alive in your mind.  I even found myself nodding or exclaiming aloud, I even started to argue out loud with a character - I really forgot that these were not real people!!!  It's also bright and funny, and exceptionally easy reading.  Although I tend not to enjoy books that are outside of the narrow definition of the romance genre, I found myself surprised at how much I really did enjoy this book. <br /> <br />\\"Madensky Square\\" is set in Vienna in 1911, and as for time and place, it is an excellent choice.  Susannah, the heroine of our story, is the proprietess of a dress shop, another excellent plot device as we get to hear about all the fashions pre-war, and all the woman who shop at this exclusive store, and all their human foibles - just delicious.  This story is set just before the First World War which changed Europe forever, and we get to live in the beautiful and cultured Vienna for as long as we are reading this wonderful story, as Ms. Ibbotson brings that era and the sense of the time vividly alive to herreaders.   <br /> <br />Every one of the characters she created are as real as real could be, and will remain in my head for a long time.  There is Susannah herself, the narrator of the story, her assistant Nini who lives with her (don't ask me how that happened, Susannah says), and who is both a bloody revolutionary and a connoiser of fashion (and Ms. Ibbotson plays up that irony to the hilt), there is the child piano prodigy who plays across the square, there are simply so many funny and memorable characters... but my especial favorite is Edith Sultzer - you simply have to read this book - just for her story alone it is worth it.  Most of this book is just full of little gossipy asides about all the people in it - just delicious! <br /> <br />Eva Ibbotson's style reminds me slightly of Maeve Binchy, one of my favorite writers.  Ms. Binchy writes about old Ireland, Ms. Ibbotson writes about old Vienna - but in many ways, there are a lot of similarities between the books - they both write about vivid, memorable characters, that lived and breathed and worked so very long ago.  Of course, they are very different authors, so don't expect too much of a similarity (especially if you don't like Maeve Binchy, you can disregard this part of the review).  <br /> <br />This was a four star for me, as opposed to a keeper, because first of all, it really didn't have a completely happy ending (I know, it wasn't supposed to!!!), and second, I personally don't like a story narrated in the first person, it spoils the story for me.  But there's really not that much difference between a four star and a five star rating anyway, except for the preference of the reader, so don't let that discourage you.	2005-06-28

Marion Chesney has written a lot of books, if you count the books written under the name M.C.Beaton, there are probably over 100.  It is inevitable that some books should be better than others, and this, to my mind, was not her best book.  Not even close.    This is the third book of The Travelling Matchmaker, featuring Miss Pym - thin, not beautiful, in her forties, formally a housekeeper and now fulfilling a life-long interest in travel with the help of a small legacy.  In \\"Penelope Goes to Portsmouth\\", we get to meet Penelope, a beautiful daughter of a \\"cit\\", and Lord Augustus, the beautiful younger brother without money or title.  And of course, plenty of fast paced action, even if the outcome is inevitable - rather more obvious than most stories.     Marion Chesney is always a light read, and she writes with a dry humor and tongue-firmly-in-cheek, so that if you have ever read her \\"Agatha Raisin\\" series you will recognize the same writer in this story.  Obviously, characters such as she writes about have never walked the earth, but usually it does make for an amusing read.  This time, however, the book seemed \\"too\\" light to me, as if she had taken every trite plot device that she remembered and through them all together to write a book.  Consider ... they are about to put the noose around his neck!When suddenly!!! complete with wicked \\"Lady\\", who is intent upon \\"revenge\\", etc.  Also, while I enjoyed the first book because of the vivid descriptions of Regency travel, and the second book, too, if a little bit less, I felt that this book was simply the same thing rehashed.  I actually groaned when the requisite wagon tumble happened - this already happened twice before - even though the reason was different this time?    I also could not warm up to the hero of this story - for three quarters of the book he was an indolent wastrel, without a single redeeming quality, and suddenly, as we reach the last page, he is \\"Transformed!!\\" Hmmm... And the deaf and dumb footman - how in the world did he learn to read and write?  In Regency England, no less?  (Keeping in mind that there are special schools today for deaf and dumb).      I am being charitable with the three stars, I personally felt the true rating closer to two stars, but I thought that perhaps someone else would enjoy it more than I did.	2005-06-21

Grady had to work extra hard to keep the ranch together after the death of their parents, as a result he is often short tempered an grouchy.  Savannah is a wonderful person, sometimes a little too-good-to-be-true, especially when it comes to her brother Richard (the never-do-well of the family).   <br /> <br />Savannah is in her thirties and has resigned herself to never getting married - she hasn't even had a date in years!  When she meets a stranded cowboy on the road and offers to give him a lift, and then one thing leads to another - can true love be so quick, and so easy? <br /> <br />What Debbie Macomber does best is create realistic characters - some good, some not so good, and some - it's up to the reader to guess?  In this book she is true to her craft, and the characters I met in this book are definitely ones I want to meet again - in the rest of the series. <br /> <br />Sweet, light reading.	2005-06-21

And the four stars is mostly for the vivid descriptions of *below-stairs* life, rarely seen in a regency novel.    Jane is the plain younger sister, so commonly the heroine in Regency fare.  She also has has the prerequisite \\"dysfunctional family\\" so common in these Regency novels, and since Marion Chesney can write *nasty* very well, I thought this family could really capture a prize.  Jane's mother hired this \\"house for the season\\" for the coming out for Jane's older sister, and incidentally Jane too, comes along.  The house they are renting was unusually cheap, and Jane's mother, never one to ask questions, is quite happy with this arrangement, but why indeed, was this \\"house for a season\\" so reasonably priced?    It seems that this house is haunted.  Jane tries to uncover the underlying mystery, and in so doing, involves the Earl in her schemes.  She captures his interest, and they eventually fall in love, as expected.  This is the limitation of this novel - as in most of Ms. Chesney's Regency novels - they fall in love and get married so suddenly, that the reader is left wondering how it happened. The romance is hardly fleshed at all - sort of like - they fell in love and they got married.    Still, a fun read.	2005-06-21

This is a clear and simply but beautifully written book - exactly what I needed to get a good feel of what dyslexia is. <br /> <br />She describes her method of overcoming dyslexia very loosely in this book, and alludes to another book where her method is more clearly outlined - as they are both out of print I will probably look for a more advanced method, or a reading specialist, to actually help my child overcome his problem. <br /> <br />But when you are not sure where to start, and what you are dealing with, this book was an invaluable aid.	2005-05-11

I stumbled across this book by chance in my local library.  What a gem!  I can't give this book enough stars!  What a pity it is out of print, I really wanted to buy a few copies and distribute it to every child educator I know!    I am not a teacher, but rather, I am a parent of a child who is \\"lazy\\", underachieving, not paying attention - you name it, you know the spiel.  I was hoping to find some kind of clue as to what was going on in his mind - I did not expect to find a full scale map!    As I was reading the first few chapters about attention controls and alertness, I found myself going \\"aha\\" every two seconds.  What he described fit perfectly with the behavior I see in my child, and now I have a more complete understanding of why he acts the way he does - always a plus for a parent.     This book was certainly not written for parents, that is obvious.  It reads like a textbook, with mostly technical terms and concise explanations for each one.  Even so, it is clearly written, and very easy to understand, if you invest the time to read it through slowly.  He explained the problems with mental energy and efficiency (I know I am using the wrong words, but the book is not with me right now), so well, that I felt as if he was standing there looking right into my brain.  And as if he had been standing there all through my school years.  How else would he have known \\"exactly\\" what everyone said to me (parents and teachers), and \\"exactly\\" what I was feeling as I was sitting in class?      Not only did I find validation for behaviors and learning patterns which I have never understood, but I have also found a lot of tips, even for myself, in getting better organized.  When I mean organized, I mean organizing the BRAIN.  I was amazed at how much more efficient I could be, when I had previously thought that I was running at top efficiency (for me).  Dr. Mel Levine does not offer \\"excuses\\" but rather, he explains what the problem is so that you have a point of referenceas to where to start fixing it.    I have not yet finished the book, if you have seen it you will know why, but there is no question in my mind that this is THE book for every educator to have as a reference.  I have so far read only the parts on attention and memory, but if I have given the impression that this book describes only ADD, I will have been giving a very wrong impression.      Dr. Levine does an impressive job in describing all kinds of learning problems, all kinds of hidden learning problems that are not obvious to parents and teachers, and how these hidden problems are impacting on a child doing the best that he/she can in school, and I guess, eventually in life.      He has written other books on learning problems, such as \\"The Myth of Laziness\\" and \\"A Different Kind of Mind\\", which are written in a more conversational style, and are directed towards parents, but I found this book more helpful in getting to the \\"core\\" of the problems, as opposed to \\"how my learning center can help\\" which is the theme of almost every book I have picked up on learning disabilites, etc.    There is one slight point that I disagree with him however.  He talks about colleges accomodating themselves to different students learning styles.  I have read educators complaining about his attitude in different Amazon reviews, and in this I feel he is going a little too far.  Elementary schools have a mandate to educate each child that comes in throught their door, and to make them into human beings who leave knowing the basics of education.  In this, I think that schools have an obligation to accomodate themselves to different students' learning styles.  But colleges are different, and I think that a college has a right to accept a student who can show good test scores in whichever format they (the college) chooses to test in.  For those students who cannot meet their criteria, there are other, less demanding colleges that will accept them.  Because after all, if they cannot pass the entrance test, how will they pass the courses?  Isn't that the point of the entrance examinations?  But of course, that's just my rant.    This book was extremely helpful to me as a parent.  My son's teacher kept telling me to get him tested, but I had no idea how to start as I saw that he is extremely bright, and could see no obvious reason for his scholastic failures.  This book pinpointed exactly what his problem is, and I am now armed with the knowledge to further help my child.  Knowledge is power, as they say.  I have another child with language issues, and I have yet to read the chapters that deal with his problems, but I am confident that I will obtain an excellent understanding of his problems as well.     This is a beautiful, excellent, wonderful, book, that should ideally be in every educator's hands.  Every school should implement the ideas presented in this book.  (Of course they won't). I only wish that Dr. Levine would write another book, in this format, for parents, sort of \\"dumb it down\\" a little bit, so us parents can understand the child's problems without all the scientific jargon which makes it difficult reading.  I know that he has written some other books, and I have read through them quickly, but I found the other books more anecdotal, without the clear and concise presentation that this book contains.    I also wish he would write a book about how learning problems affect ADULTS, and what they can do about it.  I did find it pretty easy to convert the tips into \\"adult\\" tips, but of course, I would love to read a book that is directly written for adults with these learning problems.  As strange as it may seem, I realized that a lot of adults have some of the poor learning strategies, only translated into adult behavior, and obviously, causing corresponding havoc and stress.      In any case, this book was wonderful, thank you, Dr. Levine!	2005-05-11

But dated.  I got this book from my local library as a first stop on my \\"underachieving\\" kid.  What he basically does is define four reasons why kids won't learn, and what to do about it. <br /> <br />This book is heavily psychologically oriented, which is good if this is what your child's problem is.  He seems to really care about kids and their problems, and this comes through in his writing.  However, if you have a child who is underachieving because of learning disabilities, this book is less helpful, however he does explain the psychological ramifications of low achievement. <br /> <br />One caveat:  He brings a story towards the end of the book about Mark, a kid with severe psychological problems.  I know this book was written quite a while ago, and I am not a diagnostician, but it seems to me that Mark would today be diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, as opposed to a psychiatric disorder (high grades in math, carries his box around with him, etc).  He berates the parents for not being aware of the problem, but I think that in this case he was wrong. <br /> <br />	2005-05-11

However, I can testify that I saw, personally, the extremely strong link between corrective vestibular stimulation (as shown to me by an occupational therapist), and reading problems. <br /> <br />My son was diagnosed with sensory integratin disorder at age three.  They told me that he would have trouble learning to read.  I did not believe them, as he was an extremely bright child with an above average IQ (as per tests, and as everyone kept telling me.)  Well, they were right, and I was wrong.  He did have tremendous difficulty learning to read. <br /> <br />We spent time and money on tutors, made him practice reading (which he hated).  Absolutely no results. After a session of sensory integration therapy (correctly done), he suddenly read fluently and quickly.  This only lasted for a couple of hours, at most a day, then he would regress to reading very, very slowly and stumbling over the words.  In the end, sensory integration therapy was only partly helpful, as the effects of therapy were not long-term, however sensory integration therapy is still in its very early stages, with therapists mainly using a \\"trial and error\\" method (each therapist I saw diagnosed him differently). <br /> <br />However, the link is definitely there.  I saw my son reading fluently after a SI session, it was like a light switch - on/off.  The problem being that it seemed to switch off after a certain amount of time.  His behavior also underwent a dramatic change after therapy - for the same limited amount of time.  He was calm, happy, and easy to deal with.  I suspect that when they come up with a way for parents to do this therapy easily at home - every day - we will have seen a \\"cure\\" to these neurologically based problems.	2005-04-13

What kept it from being a five star for me, was that I felt some parts of the story were too rushed, especially the ending.  We have three romances, three weddings at the end of this book, and I must have blinked, because I missed how this all happened.  Where was the emotional build-up?   <br /> <br />Dora Sutton has come to St. Brides island in answer to an advertisement - for a wife.  You have to be pretty desperate to become a mail-order bride, and Dora Sutton certainly is that.  So that when Grey St. Bride abrubtly tells her that \\"she won't do\\", Dora knows that she simply can't turn back...she has nowhere to go, and she's staying put.  And a series of unusual happenings helped her out... <br /> <br />Grey St. Bride has  a plan to turn his island, so far from nowhere, into a hospitable town, a town that is real, and for that, you need families.  His plan is to advertise for brides for his men, so that they will stay and settle, but so far his plan is not working out quite the way he planned... <br /> <br />This was a good book.  The plot was excellent, the writing was smooth and jointed, and there is enough happening in this story to keep the reader's interest.  (I loved the part where the next two brides come over, and Dora \\"adopts\\" them).  And as far as historical accuracy - I think I even learned a thing or two about how things were done over a hundred years ago. <br /> <br />But I think this was missing something in the romance department - there is no emotional build-up, no understanding of why these two got married, also no connecting the dots- how does everyone settle down, what happens to the houses, etc., and the two secondary romances came totally out of nowhere. <br /> <br />I liked this story, but I would have liked more of ending.	2005-03-14

I don't generally like this particular Harlequin line, but I liked a previous book by this author, so I tried this book. Ruth Wind is such a consistently excellent writer that anything she writes is excellent, and I really enjoyed this book. <br /> <br />This is an exceptionally beatiful book about two unlikely people from extremely different backgrounds who end up being just right for each other (though of course they both don't think so at first).  This is also an exceptionally heartwarming and emotionally compelling read.  Ruth Wind is one of those few romance writers who *really* know how to write *romance*, and the feelings she evokes in her story are feelings that will stay with you long after you turn the last page... <br /> <br />This book is a keeper. <br /> <br />P.S. Ruth Wind also writes uner the name of Barbara Samuel for those who really like her writing.  I personally like the style of \\"Ruth Wind\\" better, these stories are more romantic, while the stories she writes under the name \\"Barbara Samuel\\" seem more like \\"real-life\\" books.  But that's my personal taste.	2005-03-14

Usually I would not have gone further, but there is something about this writer's style that keeps me coming.  I think it's because she is actually one of those writers who knows how to write well, and also, it's because she really knows how to write characters.  Candace Camp's strength is definitely funny and realistic characters with fabulous dialogue, and in this book, she almost gets it right. This one I think was good, not her best, but definitely very readable.  <br /> <br />Camilla and Benedict are both very well drawn, and their interactions (dialogue) was exceptionally well done.  This was an enjoyable read, but I think I would recommend this more for someone who is rather new to the romance genre.  There is nothing really new about this story, except that it was very sweetly done.  The plot, in my opinion, was not done well (no, I didn't read Heyer's \\"The Unknown Ajax\\" yet). The plot starts off very promising, with spies, smuggling rings - it could have been exciting, but the plot goes nowhere, and the ending falls flat.  In other words, the anticipation and build-up does not live up to the actual story. <br /> <br />The romance side of this book is a solid five stars, but the lukewarm plot and storyline bumped my rating down to four stars.	2005-03-14
US	34914255	R1BVK37HV4ZTED	0373163746	796149445	Lazarus Rising (American Romance)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Even Harlequin lAmerican line, Stuart delivers...	For a Harlequin American romance, this is really top of the line, I have to say that Anne Stuart delivers, no matter what the genre or expectations! <br /> <br />I have to say that while this is only the third book that I have read by Anne Stuart, this book is so good that I am tempted to say - this is the best!  But I know that they are all the best...  The only thing stopping me from reading all her novels at once is simply a time crunch - I know that in order to start an Anne Stuart book I am going to have to block out at least three, four hours straight - because once I start this author, it's simply impossible to put it down, impossible to even realize that I do have a *real life*, and my life is so busy that I simply don't have that kind of time block at once. <br /> <br />I was wondering how Ms. Stuart was going to handle this romance - I have read that she writes \\"bad boy\\" stories, but so far this story was the most \\"bad boy\\" that I have read yet - a hero who is a gangster?  Hard for me to swallow, yet Ms. Stuart does this so well, that the romance in this book far surpassed any romance that I have read in a long, long time... Anne Stuart always delivers whatever is expected, and if Harlequin American readers expect a warm fuzzy romance than that is what she delivers ... with a bang. <br /> <br />Katharine is a girl with the perfect job, the perfect features, the perfect perfectionist - who is engaged to the perfect man, and if all this is a little boring - well, that's exactly the way she wants it.  Her heart was broken once before, ten years ago, and she never wants to go through that experience again - and if a little lack of excitement is the price to pay, so be it.  Except that the man she once thought dead is suddenly very much alive ... and he seems to have totally forgotten her existence.  Suddenly, Katharine's heretofore drab but predictable life is turned upside down, and she suddenly realizes that while she doesn't like the twist her life just took, it's also impossible to go back, to the way she was before all this happened.  She can't anymore turn back into predictable, punctual, hard-working, boring Katharine. <br /> <br />This storyline is done extremely believably, (it has to be believable, Anne Stuart is the most believable author I have ever read).  When we are given the explanation as to why he has forgotten her - it makes sense to me.  When we are shown the depth of her feelings, this makes sense to me as well.  But most of all, this is a story of ups and downs, of strong emotions and passions, for better or for worse,  acknowledged or not, and especially this is a story of impossible love - with the impossible turning into something that might be possible after all...  And through it all, the characters remain true to themselves, they never do anything that makes you dislike either of them (the way so many other stories do) - so that you are rooting for both of them (maybe that's why her stories work so well). <br /> <br />One more thing - Anne Stuart writes happy endings!  I just love the way she ties up all the strings in her stories to make you feel so warm and fuzzy - she's just a brilliant writer, period! <br /> <br />	2005-03-06

And make sure to start this book when you have plenty of time to finish, this is one book that is very, very hard to put down... <br /> <br />This was my second Anne Stuart book, and this one, so different in style from the first book I read by her, has established in my mind that this is a consistently top-notch author, no matter what the type of storyline.   <br /> <br />Shadow Lover features a classic \\"bad boy\\" hero, yet at the same time he is surprisingly endearing, he grows on you.  (Is that the fascination there is for that kind of hero - the challenge of making him a lovable man?  I wonder).    <br /> <br />Is he or isn't he?  Is he who he says he is?  Is he who she thinks he is?  Or is he all of the above?  Possibly none of the above?  Previous reviewers have outlined the plot, but the part that was impressive for me was the way I, the reader, had my emotions tied in knots.  One minute I thought - yes, he is!  Then the next minute, no he's not!  This is not so much about an ending - is he or isn't he?  But rather the ride, it's sort of like an emotional roller coaster where you don't know where the roller coaster is going, you never know where Ms. Stuart is going to go next, but boy, do you care! <br /> <br />Anne Stuart is a master at manipulating emotions, and she is also a fabulous writer who can transmit a mood by just a few words.  She is also an author with an instinctive knowledge of the human psyche.  What her pen sometimes shows us is not always a very pretty sight - yet we know that it's true, nevertheless.  Her understanding of both the good and the bad of human nature, and her talent in writing it realistically is what makes her an excellent writer, and her portrayal especially of the \\"dark side\\" is what gives her novels that *edge* - and an edge-of-your-seat reading experience. <br /> <br />I don't usually like these kind of dark and suspenseful novels, but Anne Stuart is such a good writer that I forgot that part.  Oh, and did I mention that Anne Stuart is a good writer? <br />	2005-03-06
US	34914255	R22Z8USVBLJS77	0380715554	148484562	Emily and the Dark Angel (Regency Romance)	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Very well crafted Regency	I have only read a few Jo Beverley's so far, but when I found this out of print and hard to find regency at the paperback section of the library, I could not resist. <br /> <br />As always for this author, this is a novel that is very well done.  The tone is very serious, as is also usual for Ms. Beverley, and her book is well-written, and well plotted, with very real-like characters - in short, a top-notch Regency.  But, make no mistake - this is a true Regency, so that if you dislike the Regency format, you may not find this novel much to you liking either. <br /> <br />Emily is on the way home from a business transaction of buying a flock of sheep (in proxy for her father, because he is paralyzed as a result of an ill-advised duel), when she meets up with her \\"dark angel\\" - - who is on the way home from his paramour's house.  She actually gets to witness a volatile \\"good-bye\\" scene between x and his mistress - and gets caught in the melee against her will.  He courteously walks her home against her protests - and against her better judgment.  The more she finds out about this \\"dark angel\\" the more she realizes that this is a person she would be best off having nothing to do with - but there is a part of her that can't help thinking about him - and can't help wondering - is he as black as he's painted?  The simple answer does seem to be yes. <br /> <br />Ms. Beverley has taken a rather common-place plot - the innocent and the rake (hence the title Emily and the Dark Angel), and in this book, she has given it a new face.  There are not too many ways to reform a rake - one of the easiest and the path most traveled is that he wasn't much of a rake to begin with.  But in this story, we are assured that our hero is very much a rake - possibly a villain, even.  Yes, he's every bit as black as he's painted, and Emily is every bit as innocent as she seems - but is black black?  Is what society perceives as black really black?  Or perhaps black is really white... and in Ms. Beverley's capable hands, it does seem that way... <br /> <br />I happen to particularly love a story about someone who does the right thing, yet in an unconventional way, and in a way that is censored by society.  I also like a book about someone who was hurt, and uses that as a springboard to develop a passion for justice, for right and wrong - another element of this story.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, much of this story centers around hunting - this is set in Devonshire in the hunting season, and hunting is indeed very much part of the story.  I have never come in contact with any aspect English hunting, I don't particularly have any interest in hunting, and if I were to see it up close I would probably have even less interest.  I understand that the English do have a passion for hunting - but I am the reader, and I found that part of the story not interesting for me. <br /> <br />I also found Emily's innocence a little much - while this is very realistic for that time period, and this does make for some very funny scenes (\\"pudding\\" comes to mind), Emily does tend to come across a little of the fool - and I like my heroines to have at least an equal footing in a relationsip. <br /> <br />But of course, this is still a Jo Beverley, and everything you would expect from this author is in this novel.  As usual, this is a complicated story, and there is a lot going on, each page is well filled.  Her usual brilliance of plot is here, as well.  And although I personally don't think that she is the most outstanding writer ever, many parts of this book are very well written.  In short, this is an enjoyable novel, and is exactly what you might expect from Jo Beverley, in a Regency format. <br /> <br />	2005-03-06
US	34914255	R3342IQLWSTNMG	0373293003	451710503	Wayward Widow	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Really high quality writing!	I picked up this book in the paperback rack at the library, and I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much.  After all, it *is* a Harlequin, how well-written could it be? <br /> <br />Well, I think I checked the publisher three times because I was so overwhelmed by this book.  I simply couldn't believe this was a Harlequin book!  The quality of writing was so good, the characterizations in this book were so excellently done, and the dialogue so perfect - well, this book sure is a keeper for me, and I am now checking Nicola Cornick's backlist for as many books as I can find.   <br /> <br />Ms. Cornick sure does know how to get you interested in the story!  The beginning of this story was one of the most daring opening chapters I have ever seen - in Harlequin.  But what made this book so especially memorable was that this author has managed to come up with an original plot - I have read so many Regencies but I have never read this particular plot before. <br /> <br />In this story, it is the heroine who is the rake (is there such a thing as a female rake?) who is reformed by a \\"straight\\" man - who loves her.  This pretty much sums up the plot, but this is a plot with a *lot* of potential - and Nicola Cornick plays it up to the very hilt.  This book was also very well written, one of the most nicely written books I have ever read - which is why I was so surprised it was a Harlequin.  Everything about this book was very well done, and I especially loved the way Lady Juliana knew how to speak - she knows how to give it, straight from the shoulder, but at the same time she is always a lady!  I think this is what impressed me the most - there is a lot to be said for an intelligent heroine who can stick up for herself, and be rude and polite at the same time.  I have to admit - it's an art, and I enjoyed every minute of it! <br /> <br />This was extremely well done.  It was well written, the plot was solid without any holes, and the story itself was interesting, this was a book that is \\"finished\\".  Recommended for any Regency reader who enjoys high quality writing and a somewhat different plot twist.	2005-03-02
US	34914255	RYX3CDUM9P0AT	1551665719	195838110	Shadows At Sunset	Books	5	5	8	N	N	A hauntingly beautiful story - about real people	Anne Stuart has written a book that is so good, it's fabulous.    Where should I start?  I don't like \\"bad boy\\" books, this *is* a bad boy book.  I don't like ghosts in my stories, this book has ghosts.  What can I say, except that I loved this book, it's so well written, so exceptionally, so sweetly done, that I forgot - what was it I don't like?    Anne Stuart has a different writing style from what I'm used to, a least in this book.  This is a book that is written in a terse writing style, with the assumption that less is better.  Most writers do tend to take more than a page or two to get to the point, some writers actually can make an entire book about a few days by s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g out the story to such an extent that it takes us pages and pages just to get through a single idea.  Anne Stuart writes in exactly the opposite way - she writes as shortly and concisely as possible.  I think that that's harder to do, but I happen to particularly enjoy that writing style more, and I also think that an author that can do this style is a much better writer.    So for those reviewers who complained that the story went to fast - no, you just have to read more slowly.  If you skip a paragraph, you might lose the whole thread of the story.  I'm one of those \\"fast readers\\" that likes to skip - sometimes writers go on and on about something, and I'm two pages ahead, and I didn't lose a thing about the plot.  You can't do that here.    Generally, when I finish a book, I can usually give you some idea of the author's strengths and weaknesses - good at characterization, for instance, or this book has good dialogue, or this writer writes well, or she is good at plotting . . . But when I put down \\"Shadows at Sunset\\" my mind was a total blank.  I couldn't even begin to analyze it, this is a writer who really knows what she is doing, and I can't even begin to figure out her techniques, they were way over my head. So I don't know how she did it, all I can say is that I was mesmerized from beginning to end.    Anne Stuart simply has the gift, there is no other way of putting it.  To say that she's the best writer I have ever read, period - that's a very broad statement, and I would be hesitant to say that, but if there would be *one* best writer, period, in any genre, I think that I would nominate Anne Stuart.  She's that good.    She is also a romance writer - even though she has brought in so many elements that would normally detract from a romance line, this author does not lose track of the bottom line - that we are looking for a very happy ending, and, believe it or not, this book delivers!      Anne Stuart has the gift - she has the gift of words, she has the gift of writing about *real* people, and especially, she has the gift to suck you into her book in a way that almost no other writer can.      I am so impressed with this author that I will probably buy *anything* she wrote, sight unseen, and I'm rationing them.  There's no point in gobbling them up all at once, is there?    ***** I have since read some other Anne Stuart books, and while they are all good, this one remains my personal favorite.  It has such a perfect blend of the sweet and sour, that for me, this story was totally perfect.  Recommended, recommended, recommended!!! I can't recommend this book highly enough!!!	2005-03-02
US	34914255	R3823KKCTLALUY	0821764012	69516189	An Arranged Marriage (Zebra Historical Romance)	Books	5	4	9	N	N	My first by Jo Beverley... this is a top notch author	The minute I opened this book, I knew I was in for a good read.  There is no question that Jo Beverley writes about *real* people, *real* men, *real* everything.  Her hero especially is as real as they come - she doesn't temper his personality to fit the way we women would like him to act.  I find *real* people much more enjoyable to read about than cardboard cut-outs, so I knew that I would enjoy this book. <br /> <br />This was my first book by Jo Beverley, and I really enjoyed it.  But then, this is exactly the kind of book I love most - take two real, complex people, put them in a difficult situation, and watch - how will they react?  I also liked the style of this book - simply written (you don't need a dictionary to understand the words), yet very emotionally intense and complex - which makes this kind of book my favorite for a very satisfying read.  I especially liked Ms. Beverley's talent for characterization - these are people whose personalities simply leap off the page - as I was reading, I felt that I *knew* the main characters - that they were right there in the room with me.   <br /> <br />I had just finished a Mary Balogh previous to this book, and I found the contrast interesting.  Ms. Beverley is not the master craftsman that Ms. Balogh is, this book is not as well crafted and there are some minor inconsistencies, yet \\"The Arranged Marriage\\" fills a niche of its own.  While Ms. Balogh tends to bring out the best of her characters, so that they will act in the proper, correct manner almost all the time, Ms. Beverly shows us more of a realistic portrait of real people - the good, the bad, the think-they-are-doing-good turned to bad. <br /> <br />The heroine of this book, Eleanor, was raped at the start of this book.  She is then rescued from her until-then very bad situation, to marry Nicholas, the hero of this book.  I think that Ms. Beverley does a good job of placing the blame for the rape squarely on the shoulder of Eleanor's brother - and not onthe rapist's.  She makes it very clear that the perpertrator was both drugged and blackmailed, limiting his culpability somewhat, and making him into a more sympathetic figure than he would have been otherwise. <br /> <br />Once Eleanor is rescued, the rest of the book is then focused on Nicholas's and Eleanor's \\"Arranged Marriage\\".  I, along with Eleanor, found Nicholas to be a fascinating character - in some ways he is the *rake* of every Regency book printed, but in other ways he is uniquely himself.  Nicholas seems to have been born from infancy with more than a spoonful of the proverbial charm, which he uses even as a young child to manipulate the people around him, but in a good way - as a natural leader, he helps the people who are drawn to him.  I think that it is his charm, rather than any actual physical prowess, which earned him the  title of a *rake*, and that comes across very realistically in this story.  (Nicholas purposefully seduces Eleanor, yet his medium of choice seems to be words as opposed to action - he spends a lot of time talking her into it). <br /> <br />And yet it is Nicholas's charm that becomes his undoing, because he is so used to being able to manipulate people, and circumstances, and until now his life has so completely gone the way he designed it - or charmed it - that he ends up over-estimating what he could do, and ends up for the first time in his life, realizing that there are limits even for someone as gifted as he knows he is .  . . .  <br /> <br />I found Eleanor to be realistically portrayed as well - even if she is not as forceful, or magnetic a personality as her husband.  I think she reacts extremely realistically throughout - and I don't think there can be said to be a *right* way to react - every person would react differently when presented with the same situation, and Ms. Beverley spends a lot of time showing us *exactly* how Eleanor reacted.  Of course she was upset by the rape!  She had terrible nightmares, she wasabout to kill herself.  But we do see that she is somewhat of a practical person - when presented with choice A and choice B - and choice A is to kill herself - she is practical enough to make the best of choice B - while choice B may not be exactly how she envisioned her life, it was a lot better than choice A, and better even than her life before this whole thing started, anyhow.  And besides, the fact that her husband is such a charming fellow does smooth things over with her somewhat, at least initially.  Also, if you read the book carefully, you will see how she is constantly feeling hurt, and upset, or whatever, and she keeps trying to \\"keep a stiff upper lip\\" as they say.  Yes, she is upset, but she is trying her hardest not to dwell on it, and to go on and make the best of her life, such as it is.  In other words, she is trying to be brave.    <br /> <br />I also found the relationship between Nicholas and his brother, Lord    to be extremely well-done.  I loved the constant interaction between the two of them - this is a very, very complex relationship, Jo Beverley has packed a full punch of emotional complexity all around. . .  <br /> <br />This book is somewhat unique in the romance genre in that the hero spends most of his time with his mistress, rather than with Eleanor, his wife.  In order to make this palatable to romance readers, Jo Beverley makes it clear that his mistress was actually distasteful to him, again and again she has him complaining, to all and sundry, how very difficult it is to make love to a woman he loathes; but I think in this, she has overplayed her hand, because truthfully I don't think it's possible to practice this grand deception on the level he does, if he truly does loathe Theresa.  Ms. Beverley is trying to make the infidelity *okay* because he really hates his mistress, and at the same time have Theresa believe that he is totally devoted to her.  I don't think it is truly possible to have it both ways, but she tried.  (On the other hand, we always seem to be able to believe it when women do it - for instance, prostitutes, so maybe it's not so far-fetched after all?) <br /> <br /> I would really have liked to have seen a little more in the way of a reconciliation of the h/h at the end, for so much of the book they are apart, and the ending is so quick - just two pages.  You have so much emotionally invested in these characters that the one-two-three wrap-up came as a bit of a let-down for me. <br /> <br />I was so impressed with this book that I am ordering a few more at one shot, I know that this is a writer that I will be happy with. <br />	2005-03-01
US	34914255	R36QZQAHY48HHV	1551668556	66831105	The Charm School	Books	2	3	30	N	N	Such a sad story...	I hate to be the only nay-sayer in the crowd, but I simply did not enjoy \\"The Charm School\\".   It was very well written, and the plotting and idea were excellent, but I found the story to be such a sad one that I simply could not read past the first few chapters.  (I skimmed the rest, so I know the story). <br /> <br />Isadora was not only an ugly duckling, she was so badly treated by everyone around her, and she was in such a tremendous amount of emotional pain, it took all my self control to keep from wringing their necks. Everyone was so nasty to her, there was not one person who was nice to her? <br /> <br />I have to admit that I did identify somewhat with Isadora, but I was simply horrified by the way she was treated.  The intensity of the cruelty of the people around her seemed horrific beyond words - I have to thank G-d that I was not treated this way.  I have to admit that like Isadora I wasn't Miss Social Debutante - but most people were not outright nasty to me, the way people are here in this story.  I was simply horrified. <br /> <br />Especially since very early on in the story, I was able to figure out why Isadora acted the way she did.  There is something called \\"sensory integration disfunction\\", if you will type this into any search engine you can get a lot of information about this condition.  This is a minor nervous system disorder - similar to ADD, yet very easily diagnosable, and also easily treated (no drugs, just certain kinds of exercise).   \\"Sensory integration\\" is how the nervous system, and the brain, process all the millions of sensory stimuli that are constantly around us and are able to synthesize it into a cohesive whole.  Some people have excellent sensory integration, and these are the people who seem very much at ease with themselves and with their bodies, their sensory input is processed quickly and efficiently, and they will come across as \\"poised\\" and \\"with it\\" because their nervous system does a better job at processing and interperting everything around them.  At the other end of the spectrum are people whose nervous systems do a poor job processing all kinds of stimulation properly - and these deficiencies can come across in many different ways.  One of the faces of SID is the way Isadora is presented - awkward, clumsy, tongue tied, and ill at ease in the physical world around her.  <br /> <br />The most serious end of the SID spectrum is autism.  An autistic child or person usually has very bad sensory integration, and this is why they sometimes hear things either lower or higher than they actually are, they will feel things either not at all, or they are extremely sensitive. (Perhaps that's also why they do sometimes bizarre - to us - activities, such as rocking, because they are trying to stimulate a nervous system (vestibular stimulation) which is under-stimulated because they can't process normal stimulation properly).  But most people with poor sensory integration are not autistic, and their deficiencies are usually not as dramatic or serious as the autistic person's deficiencies.  <br /> <br />Normal people who have SID may have difficulty processing auditory stimuli - for instance they will hear a little too loud, or too low, or they will be unable to tune out background noises as well as the average person, which makes it harder for them to concentrate in class, let's say, if there's a humming from the electricity, for instance.  Or they will be more sensitive to certain clothing - or less sensitive so that they don't feel pain the way they should, and will do dangerous things - like scald themselves - because they don't realize how hot the water is.   <br /> <br />Some children with SI crave stimulation - because since they are not processing the ordinary stimulation around them in a meaningful way, they crave an \\"extra\\" dose just to feel normal.  Other children with SI will be too sensitive - and will feel that even the slightest touch \\"hurts\\" them.  One thing they all have incommon is that they are \\"out of sync\\" with the world around them - which is why SID is sometimes called being \\"out of sync\\". <br /> <br />I could go on and on, there are many, many more ways for this to come across in real life, but the way this translated to this story is that Isadora is almost a  classic poster child for SID.  One of the most common symptoms is difficulty with gross motor planning - dyspraxia.  She is awkward because she can't maneuver herself properly, because her brain is not processing the nervous system stimulation efficiently, and therefore she feels awkward both physically and socially.  When she goes into a crowded ballroom, SID will especially get worse - because of the increased nervous system input.  It is almost cruel to put someone with SID into a crowded ballroom filled with music, talk, people, and lights, and expect her to react normally. <br /> <br />Most people do outgrow it by the time they reach adulthood - or learn to live with it, or compensate - but it seems that Isadora was so badly treated that she did not get a chance to do that.  Because of the way she was constantly put down it became impossible for her to develop on her own a way to deal with her deficiencies.  She simply lacked the confidence and courage to deal with her problems, people who are constantly put down simply cannot grow up, and this is what has happened to Isadora.  <br /> <br />I have worked with children, and have seen this scenario often.  Just after I read this story I met Isadora personified in a little three year old.  He looked so sad, so much pain in such a young face.  This was because he was very clumsy, constantly tripping, breaking things, etc. and was always getting punished.  I was so glad to be able to help him, but this is why I couldn't read this story.  It was simply too painful to me.  I couldn't help her in any way, I couldn't give her confidence over the pages, and reading about all that pain without being able to help was simply toomuch for me. <br /> <br />The author happens to treat Isadora in a way that is consistent with the way we treat SID today - different kinds of exercise - in therapy lingo called sensory, tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular stimulation.  Working on a ship would provide all the right kinds of stimulation - plus I guess the food rationing and exercise would help her figure, and the fact that she was away from her cruel family and friends did a lot too. <br /> <br />All in all, this was not a book that I was glad I read. <br /> <br />If you want a really realistic, but funny Ugly Duckling story, I would suggest you try \\"Bet Me\\" by Jennifer Crusie.	2005-03-01
US	34914255	R2S9PY9HSKXYVU	1551668394	66225134	Wedding Party	Books	4	19	22	N	N	Not a romantic comedy at all, but still ... quite good	While this was a good book, I would definitely *not* categorize it as a romantic comedy.  So if you are looking for something light and funny, there are plenty of (other) authors to try.  I would categorize this book, rather, as an issue-based contemporary romance - sort of women's fiction, if you will. <br /> <br />I liked this book.  I like Ms. Carr's writing style, it's light, easy to read, and she has the gift of making her characters seem real.  But while the writing is light, the issues she explores are not.  So this is a hard-to-categorize book - light reading because of the easy-to-read style, but heavy reading because of the many characters and heavy issues that they are dealing with. <br /> <br />I found that while I didn't particularly like the heroine, Charlene, I found myself liking her a lot more at the end, when she finally gets all the pieces of her life together and realizes where she went wrong in the way she was living her life, and looking back, says to herself - I know I made a lot of mistakes, but they were inevitable at the time - and I think that that's very, very realistic.  Yes, that's real life - most of us haven't figured everything out at twenty (like some Regency heroines seem to do), but rather, we figure things out slowly, bumblingly, just like the heroine did.   <br /> <br />I happened to have really liked Grant, her daughter Stephanie's boyfriend.  I know that we don't get to know him too well, because we don't get to see him too much - but isn't that just the point, isn't that what Stephanie is upset about as well.  But I do like the way he's sure of himself, knows where he's going and what he's planning on doing with his life, unlike Stephanie?  And Grant is a hero through and through, even to the end - when he said good-bye, it was a classy good-bye (I'll pay your rent until you figure out what you want to do), I thought he was very mature, and I liked him.  (By the way, don't you think it's funny the way they keep on insisting what a *wonderful* job they did raising their daughter when it's so obvious she's a little screwed up?) <br /> <br />I also really liked Jake - I sometimes felt like shaking Charlene at how she was treating him, isn't it great to have someone so in love with you that he stays around even after the divorce - and she treats him like dirt, and he still loves her...  <br /> <br />I wouldn't give this book five stars, it wasn't great riveting reading, but on the other hand I did enjoy it, and I really liked the ending, I think it wrapped things up very well.  I would even say that the ending bumped up this book from being a three-star pleasant read, to a four star, better than average read. <br />	2005-03-01
US	34914255	R1XEF72VAHBMKA	1551666189	224857817	Manhunting (Mira)	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Simply the best!	This is really one of those rare books that overwhelm Amazon's rating system - Amazon only allows you up to five stars, but this book is really worth much more, if there was such a thing as ten stars, this book would be it, IMHO. <br /> <br />One of the fun things of finding a brilliant author with a backlist is that you get to read some really good gems, and this sure is one of them.  Nothing different or unusual about the plot - uptight, female executive goes husband-hunting and ends up with the exact opposite of what she had planned;  but the way this book is done, wow!  The characters, the way they interact, the dialogue, even Jennifer Crusie's signature craziness, is all there, this book is simply a masterpiece, if you are looking for a solid few hours of enjoyment, \\"Manhunting\\" is sure to deliver! <br /> <br />The characters - it's funny, but I read a *serious* work, and I recognize the characters - vaguely.  I read a Jennifer Crusie book, and these people - I know them, they're me, my friends, people that I could relate to.  I think it's because they're unpredictable, and don't fit into a mold - that makes them more real, because people seldom do predictable things in real life, and sometimes life is even a little crazy.  So I think that Jennifer Crusie *does* real life better than some of the more serious authors that I have read.  I suppose it helps that Ms. Crusie really is a brilliant author - it's women like her who spoil me for any other kind of novel. <br /> <br />I had just finished reading \\"A Summer to Remember\\" by Mary Balogh, and, transported in another time and another place, these two books have a similar plot (which is not hard to do, considering that this must be \\"the\\" most used romance plot ever).  And I thought this book was done better.  I especially loved that Ms. Prim and Proper managed to liberate herself all by herself, and wasn't waiting for \\"Mr. Right\\" to do it for her.  I generally like it more when women are able to do things on their own, instead of waiting for *him* to fix them, but rather, they fix themselves.  What brought this observation to mind was the \\"going swimming in the lake\\" thing, Kate did it on her own, while Lauren had to be forced into it.  I usually hate being forced into *anything*, even by Mr. Right, so I liked this particular part of the story a lot better here. <br /> <br />But that just my observation! <br /> <br />Loved \\"Manhunting\\".  Read it, you'll love it too.	2005-03-01
US	34914255	R1X4TN4TQEHAI9	0451187288	908098194	The Gypsy Duchess (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Five stars the first few chapters...three stars for the rest	There is no doubt about it, Nadine Miller writes well.  Better than well, actually, the first few chapters of this book were some of the most beautiful writing I have ever read - beautifully written, emotionally gripping, vibrant, unusual characters - this promised to be an exceptional story.   <br /> <br />As the book went on however, the writing turned mundane, the threads of the plot went off into predictable (to me) directions - and I was left with a less-than-satisfying feeling when I closed the last pages of this book.  In a word, the potential was there, but something went wrong somewhere.  Perhaps it was sloppy editing - I found at least twenty glaring typos in my edition of the book, and the probability that the syntax got any editing at all is nil.  Or perhaps it was that Ms. Miller tries too hard to bring in the Gypsies - instead of being on the parameters of this story, they end up taking center stage.  There was a lot of history there, and that part was really very interesting, as to how the Gypsies lived, and their culture, etc., but I did feel it took away the emphasis from the central plot of the story, and besides, when I read a Regency, I like to read a Regency, but this wasn't it.  This kind of story would have worked better, in my opinion, in a full length historical, where you have the space to go into historical detail without detracting from the storyline. <br /> <br />Moira had a brief affair with Devon's older brother, but after she jilted him to marry the elderly Duke, he went off to war and got killed. The Duke is now also dead, and the new Earl (Devon) has been named guardian of the young Duke who is seven years old, and Moira's stepson.  Considering his feelings for Moira, this is an honor he vehemently refuses, until circumstances make it compelling for the situation to change. <br /> <br />It seems to me that this author tries to work in 60's sensibilities into a Regency era novel, as the way this plot develops is to compel Moira to embrace - and publicly acknowledge - her Gypsy heritage.  I personally didn't like this part, I felt that this simply would never, never have worked in actuality - in that time frame of history.  I also didn't feel that Moira had valid reasons for refusing the Earl's offer of marriage for so long - as a Duchess, surely any stains from her parentage would be erased by her first marriage - as long as she would have kept quiet about it, which is why I don't like it that the author seems bent on bending circumstances to force the issue.  I also would have liked to see more of her relationship with the Duke - why did he marry her?  And why . . . when you read the story, there are so many unanswered questions, as to why different things happen. . . <br /> <br />This is definitely an author that has tremendous amount of potential, but the too-many-branched plotline, along with a lack of an understanding on my part of Moira's reluctance to wed, kept this book from being the five plus stars it had the potential for being. <br /> <br />The way this book actually ended up, this is the kind of story that I would usually rate three stars, but the beautiful writing hiked it up to four stars. <br />	2005-03-01
US	34914255	R32HJK8DH0W8HP	0312976992	268267931	The Matchmaker	Books	3	2	6	N	N	Warning: don't try this at home!	This was not my favorite book, for a variety of reasons, many of them personal to me.  I don't generally review books that don't hold my interest, because there are a lot of books out there, and I don't think it's fair to give a book a negative rating just because of my personal preference, especially if a book is well-written, as this book is.  But Ms. Becnel does make some assumptions in this book, and I would like to be the first one to address these issues realistically. <br /> <br />Ms. Becnel makes her story believable, that true love can indeed cure addiction, mental illness.  Now, I am just as romantic as anyone else, and I would truly love to believe that this kind of scenario could happen, but truthfully, it can't.  Not in real life.  Anybody who's married to someone with an addiction problem knows that no matter how much the person loves his spouse, or anyone else, the addiction is going to win.  The addiction is always going to win.  That's why it's called an addiction.   <br /> <br />So, if Neville overcame an alcohol addiction by himself, there are only two likely scenarios - either it wasn't *really* an addiction, or he didn't really overcome it.  From the way it is described in this book - Neville's issues - guilt and trauma from his part in the war, plus heavy drinking to overcome that trauma - qualifies as a full blown addiction.  This kind of addiction is never cured by just *deciding* to stop.  Think about it, how easy is it to just decide - I am not going to be addicted any more, and stop?  It's not.  That's why there are programs, with highly trained professionals, and even *they* don't have a 100% success rate.  Far from it.   <br /> <br />Ms. Becnel explains Neville's addiction by showing us that the reason he drinks is because he is in so much emotional pain - plus he has terrible nightmares which don't let him sleep, and guilt because of what happened in the war.  This explanation is supposed to make him understand him, and not judge him for drinking.  I have news for you - most, if not all, of people addicted to alcohol are drinking to drown their pain, whatever their pain may be.  But you knew that.  So, although it does make us understand Neville better, it doesn't help him get out of the addiction, it doesn't change the fact that he is addicted to alcohol. <br /> <br />Actually, his emotional issues add, rather than detract, from the severity of Neville's drinking problem.  In this story, Neville has terrible nightmares whenever he goes to sleep.  Since he has these nightmares only at night, he tries to stay up all night, and sleeps in the morning.  From the way it's described in this story, it seems to me that this is a serious emotional disorder. Ms. Becnel addresses it in a very perfunctory way - talk about it, and it will go away.  I think therapists would love to have treated Neville - he responds so easily to the slightest therapy!  Unfortunately, I think this part of the story is also very unlikely - serious emotional illnesses do not go away so quickly. <br /> <br /> <br />Can people be helped by the love of those close to them?  Yes, I think so, I wouldn't be reading romance books otherwise.  Can people overcome serious depression/addiction issues through the love of those close to them?  Yes, yes, but not love alone.  Today there is medication, therapy, all these things which were not available in those days, and frankly, today, even with all the knowledge that we have today about depression/guilt, addiction, not everyone can be helped.  I don't even want to think about what the success rate was before these things became available. <br /> <br />What I think I am trying to say is that there are a lot of problems that I believe can be overcome with the right person, but serious mental issues and/or addiction is not one of them.  Addiction is simply too strong, which is why addicts will sacrifice everything - family, friends, and ultimately sometimes their own life, they will throw everything that is precious to themselves into the garbage - all because addiction is more powerful than anything else in the world. <br /> <br />(For a more realistic view of Neville, read 16 Lighthouse Road series, by Debbie Macomber - although Dan and Neville are very similar, Dan never gets over his issues, and this is portrayed sadly, but realistically, by Ms. Macomber). <br /> <br />So, I am writing this review as a warning.  I am not upset about this story, I understand it's just a story, not real life, and an author has total autonomy to make her characters act exactly the way she wants them to.  But, if you are reading this, please don't confuse it with real life.  Most of all, please, please don't make any life decisions based on the assumptions made in this story.  Although I am not saying that people shouldn't marry someone who has any emotional issues, you should however go into such a relationship with your eyes open.  Don't expect things to fall into place easily. <br /> <br />Recommendation: If you are looking for a very straight, complex, and realistic look on male depression, read \\"I Don't Want to Talk About It\\" by Terrence Real. <br />	2005-02-08

Mary Balogh has written a book with a tremendous amount of emotional depth, and with her usually beautiful writing, this book is as always, another winner. <br /> <br />A word of warning:  I picked up this book a total of ten times before I actually got into it.  I have already noticed a pattern in Mary Balogh's writing that the first hundred pages are pretty tame, but then the pace picks up, and the story becomes so emotionally compelling that you can't put it down.  Maybe it's that she spends the first half of the book creating a setting, the characters - putting everything into place for her story - but whatever it is, if you found yourself bored in the beginning, skip to towards the middle of the book - the pace picks up at that point. <br /> <br />When I first picked this up I found the initial characters a little boring and somewhat stereotypical - the ultimate, most outrageous rake paired with the prim and proper lady - and I had seen this done so many times that I really wondered what Mary Balogh could add.  But that's where I was wrong.  Mary Balogh could add quite a bit, it turned out. As usual, she has turned out a masterpiece of a book.   <br /> <br />Although, I have to admit that I never quite warmed to the character of Lauren, nor have I ever really understood her.  It seems to me that someone like Lauren would not be able to answer both Kit and the Bedwyns the way she did, it takes a tremendous amount of confidence to be able to a. answer that way, and b. feel that way, and I am not sure from where Lauren would have gotten that confidence (given her background).  I also was not quite sure why Lauren had to be pushed into *enjoying* physical activities - I know people who are just not into the physical, contact sport thing, and they're perfectly happy and well-adjusted people - so why does Lauren have to change in this area? (In case you're wondering, I do enjoy physical, contact sports). <br /> <br />Unlike some previous reviewers, this is not the first book I have read by Mary Balogh, and therefore my criteria are probably harder to fill.  She has done this already, if not this exact plot, then parts of it, in previous novels.  For me, this took away from my full enjoyment of this book.  Is it fair to rate an author against herself?  Not really.  But sometimes, unconsciously, we do it anyway.  So, even though this book on its own would probably have merited a five star, for me this was only a four star book, as this was not a keeper for me.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-08
US	34914255	R1L2CU8RQ0C1BA	0060513659	87860638	Yours Until Dawn (Avon Historical Romance)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Better than five stars!!!	\\"Will you still love me when those lips are puckered not in passion, but with age?  Will you love me when my eyes are faded, but my affections for you undimmed?\\"     Maybe it's because I've been reading so many Regencies lately, and they tend to all read alike after awhile, but \\"Yours Until Dawn\\" is a Regency that really stands out from the crowd. The writing, is as usual for Teresa Medeiros, really beautiful, the story is one that has been done before, but this one is done better, with a different twist, and in general, is a different kind of story, for someone who is looking for something different set in a Regency era.    I have to admit that I was hesitant about this book to start.  I always love Teresa Medeiros, she writes beautifully, but I was a little worried about the \\"blind hero\\" theme, since I don't generally like a sad story, plus I find it rare that an author can do this realistically and still make a romance.  I needn't have worried.  This was not only realistically done, but beautifully done as well, with just the right blend of sweet and sour, funny and sad, for a beautiful and heartwarming read, and a story that stays with you long after you turn the last page.    I even liked all the plot twists (look, you have to make it a little different to make it interesting), and I even liked the ending.  Sure, it's a little too much happily-ever-after - but this is make believe, not real life, after all - and we all need an unbelievable, too-good-to-be-true ending for our forays into dream world.    Although when this book starts off it seems like it will be a re-make of Beauty and the Beast, there is a twist to this story that turns the original story and stands it on its head.  I have noticed that Ms. Medeiros generally does use fairy tales as her starting point for many of her stories, but this story does go into it's own direction, this is without a doubt an original story, and beautifully written as well.     I absolutely recommend this book, without any reservations, with \\"Yours Until Dawn\\" I think Teresa Medeiros has written her best book yet.  So if you like Regencies, or if you like this author, you will definitely *love* this book.  I can't recommend this book highly enough, it's a gem in every way.  Thank you, Ms. Medeiros!	2005-02-07

But a few pages into this book, I was so riveted that I simply couldn't put it down, I couldn't stop reading.  Then I went back and re-read it slowly and carefully, to the very last page, because this is one of the best books I have ever read. <br /> <br />This book *is* about \\"The Make a Wish Foundation\\", and about breast cancer, but on the other hand, it is also about so much more, and it was so well-written, so beautifully and realistically categorized, that, like some previous reviewers, I would love to see another book on these characters.  Ms. Dawson, Encore, please! <br /> <br />This book starts off about Holly, but she quickly meets Maggie and Grace, and they soon turn into a three-some of good friends, cemented by the fact that they are all going through some kind of crisis in their life.  Holly is twenty-five, Maggie is forty-five, and Grace is in her mid-sixties, so that we get a very good snapshot of three women at three very crucial stages of their life - Holly, who is entering adulthood, Maggie, facing her empty nest, and Grace, dealing with the inevitable problems of aging and sickness. We also get some very cute conversations as they explore the generation gap - and their different attitudes towards work, marriage, husbands, children. <br /> <br />I loved, loved, loved this book.  I have to admit that I like books with more than one plot-thread, I tend to get bored easily and I like books like this that have more than one primary character that can keep my interest.  Add to that some extremely realistic characters, and excellent writing, and I, at least, have found a real keeper.  There is something about each of these three women's dilemma's that ring true, that feel real.  While I have been in Holly's shoes, and I can tell you that that is *exactly* how I felt, I can feel that Maggie and Grace, too, were extremely realistically portrayed. <br /> <br />I did not feel that this book had toolittle of the men-in-their-lives, I think that that would have made it a little too complicated, and besides, this book was all about the women. <br /> <br />No matter what your tastes, I really don't think that you can go wrong with this truly exceptional novel! <br />	2005-02-07

This was my first book by this author, and as I started it I thought - oh, what beautiful writing, I have found another great author.  But great writing is one thing, and plot and storyline is something else, and good writing without a good storyline is - an essay?    Perhaps I am being overly harsh, as I am reading it as an adult Regency, but if it is marketed for teen-agers - then perhaps the extremely unlikely and unrealistic twist of events would not be so bad?      The main premise of the story - that of our hero dressing as a woman - I found to be not only out of character and unlikely, but even the hero's reasoning as to why he would do it is very much lost on me.  I read it carefully but I really couldn't figure it out.  Dressing up as a woman seems an extremely far-fetched solution to the *very* common problem that our hero was presented with.  Indeed, it seems that the only reason for this charade is so that this author has a story - a very good reason, to be sure, but it doesn't quite convince me . . . Along with an extremely strange scenario where the villain quickly becomes the secondary hero - my, wouldn't you let your daughter marry this guy?  Someone who is a blackmailer, among even less savory things?     A previous reviewer has compared this author to Georgette Heyer - I'm afraid I can't see any comparison at all.  Georgette Heyer's plots always made sense.    While Georgette Heyer has used cross-dressing as a plot device in many of her books, and has made for some exceptional and funny stories, I found that in this story, I simply could not get into it, because I could not believe that this guy actually did it.  I could not understand his rationale at all, it simply didn't make any sense.  Once you feel that the story is fake, the rest of the book becomes boring because you feel that you are reading a made up story, as opposed to a story that COULD have been true.  Sorry, but that was how I read it.    This was a pleasant,farcical read, beautifully written, but be prepared to keep any realism very strongly in check if you want to enjoy this book.	2005-01-12

If you have had your fill of the usual storyline and protaginists, than you may find this book a welcome change of pace. <br /> <br />I liked the heroine very much - she is not your silly, cookie-cutter spoiled brat, even though she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth - she makes sure to make that point over and over again.  And she even comes across that way as well in this story - she has more guts, brains, and maturity than your average romance heroine.  And Bram - when he first makes his appearance I thought he was really awful - but never judge by first impressions, they tell you, and Bram does sort of grow on you as the book goes on.  It helps that I wasn't so shocked by the hero's obsession with his wife's grave thing - having encountered this exact story-line in the long-ago published \\"Red Threads\\" by Rex Stout - and seen that story resolved well. <br /> <br />There are some loose ends to this story - the arranged marriage, the improbability of the hero being both a computer/science genius/geek and star football player?? - no, this book was not high on the realism scale.   <br /> <br />The style of this book was well-written and funny, but the somewhat slow pace and the obvious implausibility of parts of the plot turned this book into a four star, for me. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a romance that is somewhat off the beaten path, unusual characters, and high quality writing, I would definitely recommend \\"Then Comes Marriage\\".	2005-01-12

I have to admit, I wavered between a four and five star rating for this one.  I love Teresa Medeiros's writing style, and I loved the poignancy of this tale (where Willow, the Cinderella of this tale, has always dreamed of her prince to rescue her from her wicked stepmother, only to find that her prince is not what she expected); however, Ms. Medeiros has a tendency to step out of reality in her stories, which she did to an overwhelming degree in this one.  Sometimes this style works (as in Nobody's Darling), but here it does seem a little bit much.    First, what I liked - like I said, I love Teresa Medeiros's writing.  Her prose flows smoothly and sweetly, gently enveloping the reader in a fantasy cloud of her choosing.  She has also created a very likable heroine (Willow), who, after being married by proxy by the hero of our story, and hopes to finally find her prince who will love her, finds herself in a very different situation then she envisions. The first surprise is - he wasn't really looking for a wife - but for a mother for the twelve children that he already has!  And to top it all off, once he sees her, he decides that he doesn't want her at all! And of course, there are a lot of funny side characters, especially the children - twelve children trying to make as much havoc as possible (and very often succeeding!)    Then there is the prince, I mean the hero, Bannor, who is actually quite likable, once you get past - say, the middle of the book - and he does turn into an exceptionally unselfish and sweet husband.    But I took off a star for the sense of unreality that pervades the entire book - an unreality that never quite goes away, even after all the explanations at the end, where everything gets tied up. I personally thought the explanations a little lame. I happen to be one of those readers that can take some unreality - I don't mind if this story can never have happened, if the author writes in a way that makes it believable - or sarcastic or funny- but this did not happen in this story.    Let's start with my first problem - a problem that I actually haven't seen mentioned yet.  Bannor's father sired how many children - fifty or so?  and that's the legit children.  We are told that the amount of children he had that were not legitimate were probably twice that many.  And out of all those children, and over the \\"real\\" sons, the king gives the castle to Bannor?  And how exactly did he get into the kings amazingly good graces?  I suppose by his fabulous strength, and prowess in battle, although the story doesn't say.  Besides, where would a [...] child get the necessary training (or supplies)?    Then the children - I know that children can be exasperating, and hard to manage, but she keeps writing lines like - he went into battle against mighty enemies, but trembled before a far greater foe (the children).  That's just a little hard to believe.  Okay, maybe she's exaggerating a bit, but she keeps writing this over and over, it got a little hard to take.  And anyway, I don't know how children were raised in the Middle Ages, but there doesn't seem to be a nanny, or anything, in charge of them.  Even if they were supposed to be running free - well, you still need someone to take care of them - breakfast, lunch, supper, baths, etc.  You'd think that with Bannor's wealth, he could afford to take one or two peasants and hire them to take care of the kids.    Come to think of it, Bannor really is a lousy father, isn't he?  When the children misbehave, he doesn't seem to know how to react at all.  They do all kinds of pranks, and he doesn't do a thing.  He doesn't react to them at all.  He doesn't even yell at them.  I wonder why?  And even when he explains why he doesn't discipline the kids - to me it seems more of a rationale than a real reason.  That part of the story is a little unrealistic to me, too.    These are just a few examples. I can go on, but other reviewers have already done it for me.  I'll just say that I love Teresa Medeiros, and I will definitey continue to read her books.  I love the way she writes, and I found this book a very enjoyable read. Just do be prepared to do a little suspension of reality while you are reading this book.	2005-01-05

When he returned - years later - he found Sara back home - with a child that was not his.  This story deals with how Dru and Sara handle this and are able to get over it. <br /> <br />Just one problem - when Sara explained her side of the story, I simply did not see that there was a problem at all.  From where I sit, Sara did not do anything really wrong, maybe only a small lapse of judgment, and from then on I found Dru's reaction not-understandable.  It's one thing when he walked in and was hit in the head with it - so to speak - quite another when he gets the explanation and still reacts like she did something terrible - well, Dru did not come across as my favorite hero, at all. <br /> <br />And Sara as the heroine was not too much better either.  Okay, she's a pretty nice person, and a good person, but she does some small, but stupid things in this novel that make me like her alot less.  First, there is all this stuff about her grandaddy's charms.  I have no problem with charms, and I'm sure her grandaddy helped alot of people, and in those days charms were probably almost as good as real medicine - almost, but not quite.  She herself explains how the charms work - the placebo effect, so to speak.   <br /> <br />but she IS married to a doctor - you'd think she'd have a little bit of respect for his profession - even if she really DID think her charms worked better than his medicine (doubtful) - have a little respect for your husband, please?  If I go to a doctor, and the doctor examines me and gives me a prescription to follow, and on the way out the nurse whispers to me - take this herb, it'll work - how long do you think the nurse will be working for that doctor?  And if that person would be his wife - well, I don't know about you, but I would be wondering about the state of their marriage, wouldn't you?  And this is supposed to be a romance novel. <br /> <br />Jill Marie Landis has her formula - she writes decently, with a strong emphasis on emotional depth, in which she explores her characters - why they do things, how they feel as they are doing it, etc.  Sometimes this formula works for me, sometimes it doesn't.  I suspect this has to do with how much I like the h/h - in a character driven novel, this is essential.  And I just couldn't like these two characters that much. <br /> <br />I would rate this only an average read, that's how it was for me.	2005-01-03
US	34914255	RQ20S4XW0IEFR	0451187377	902302862	The Secret Nabob	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Beautifully romantic regency novel	If I had to custom order a Regency novel, \\"The Secret Nabob\\" is exactly what I'd order.  Beautifully written, this book has a sweet, gentle rythm that envelopes you in the world Ms. Kirkland has created - the beautiful, peaceful Regency countryside.  While there is a plot, its a fairly straightforward one, and quite standard; but the almost musical writing style and the sweet, but not too sweet, romance, more than makes up for any lack of originality or complexity in plot.    When the wealthy nabob has come back from India to live in the neighboring Balenger estate, Mrs. Wycliff sits up and takes notice.  Wouldn't it be just a perfect match for her daughter Priscilla - although only seventeen, if she were to marry a rich man wouldn't all their problems be over. . . Meanwhile, Madeline, the older daughter, meets a man in the meadow whom she only knows as Philip.  He seems so very nice - but she is a lady, how can she stoop so low as to marry a laborer?    The Wycliffs are everything a dysfunctional Regency family should be, Madeline is everything the brave older sister always is, and her romance is just perfect for Regencyland, where everything always works out the way it really should. . .     I have read a lot of books, Regency and otherwise, and although I must have seen this plot done before, nobody has done it better than Martha Kirkland.  If you are looking for a *real* Regency book, that is beautifully written, this is the book to get.	2004-12-29

This is one of those novels that has everything - true historical accuracy, real, real characters, great plot, and lots of fun, fun, fun!    It's too hard to explain the plot, and anyway, since so much of what makes this novel so funny hinges on the plot, it would be a pity for me to write it if you can read Celeste Bradley's far superior writing.  Basically, this is about a young English lady, who, realizing that as a single woman she has very limited options, (can't travel, etc on her own), decides to make up a husband (Mortimor Applequist - don't you just love the name?).  But somehow, she has aroused suspicion - what to do?  But fear not, Agatha's imagination is up to anything at all, and when she has to think on her feet, she is on top form!  Until her tangle of very many fabrications tangle themselves up and threaten to trip her. . .     Both the heroine - Agatha - and the hero - Simon - are both such very likable people, but especially Agatha.  She comes across as so real, that you half expect her to pop up in your living room as you're reading this book.  And you wouldn't mind, either, Agatha is just the person you wanted to spice your life up, just the person you wanted to be your best friend.  What a pity she's not real!  And Simon is no slouch either.  And their romance is beautifully done, and so completely believable - this is a book that truly does satisfy on every level.    While most novels are either heavy on the characterization or heavy on plot, this book can easily stand on either the characters, or the plot!  This is an unusual novel, in that it  is *both* plot and character driven, which means that you have some very interesting and funny characters constantly doing interesting and funny things.  This is also a very nicely plotted book - everything that happens is there for a reason, which you find when Ms. Bradley so nicely wraps it all up for us at the end. . . I would recommend this book to anybody - no matter what your taste, you are sure to find what you're looking for in \\"The Pretender\\".  And I'm off to buy the next in the series!	2004-12-29
US	34914255	RIZY2BS5TQO1U	0451202589	361371206	The Ambitious Baronet (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	I really enjoyed April Kihlstrom's writing style.	How you feel about an issue being discussed in a book is always a main criteria in how much you will enjoy a book, any book, but all the more so in the Regency genre, where the plot and issues discussed are the main focus of the book. <br /> <br />April Kihlstrom writes in her afterward that the issue discussed in this book (child abuse) is one that is close to her heart, and I have to admit, that it is close to my heart, too.  That, and another issue discussed - acceptance by society - is the reason why I gave this book five stars. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the way the h/h communicate.  Not for them the silences, and misunderstandings of the characters of the other romance books, they communicate in an emotionally honest, yet polite and positive way - exactly the way I would love to communicate if I could remember to do it right!  If you are looking for a positive role-model in good communication skills, you can't do better than read really sweet book by April Kihlstrom. <br /> <br />Miss Alexandra Barlow, the eldest of the three Barlow sisters, has determined never to marry - she is twenty-five - on the shelf, after all, and then, there are the children. . .  Margaret, the mysterious woman who lives alone in a cottage in the woods, keeps handing her children that she has rescued from abusive circumstances, and never one to walk away from such pain, Alex takes them in - first there is one, then two, then three, then - how many?  The author doesn't say, but there are quite a lot. Until circumstances - her father's financial ruin and suicide - force her to reconsider.  Henley house is no longer there's, and where will they live now?  And what will they do?  For herself, and her sisters, there could be a solution, but then what will be with the children!  <br /> <br />Sir Robert Stamford is on a mission to discover what is happening in the countryside - children are disappearing and it is up to him to find out what is happening, why it is happening, and especially,to find those missing children, and return them to their proper homes (parents, or masters).  During his investigations, he turned up Lord Henley as a possible link in the mystery - and when he wins the estate from Lord Henley, and Lord Henley promptly blows his brains out, Sir Robert is now the reluctant owner of a new estate, along with Lord Henley's daughter (or is it daughters?).  And he is no closer to finding out what happened to the children . . .  <br /> <br />I liked the way Ms. Kihlstrom writes.  I like the way she handled the issues raised in this book.  I liked the way she dealt with the problem of children being abused - although I think that her quick and easy solution was to some degree a bit too quick and easy.  Even today, there is no quick and easy solution to the problem of child abuse.  Taking away the child, while it seems to solve the problem most completely, comes with a host of new problems.  Children who were abused are not so easily handled, they have \\"issues\\", they can be hard to deal with - unlike the children in this story who seemed to be almost unnaturally well-behaved.  (I have children, and it happens that they are relatively well-behaved, but these *perfect* children exist only in dream-world).   Real abused children can act out in many ways, which is why an older child is so hard to place.  And they can be homesick, believe it or not.  They were rejected by their real parents, but they may want their real parents back, even with everything.  They can act out against their caregivers.  It seems that Ms. Kihlstrom glossed over these issues, but okay, this IS a story, after all, and I will allow the author some poetic license.  (And what about the easy solution about the problem of the *authorities*?  Today, what Alexandra did would mean a jail-sentence - were times really so different  in those days?)  And what about the cost of feeding all those extra mouths?  And clothing?  Even today, feeding children is expensive, it must have been much more so back then. <br /> <br />I really liked the way the other issue in this story - acceptance in society - was handled.  In this story, our hero was raised in an orphanage, and to him, his dream always was to be able to go out in society, to be accepted by everyone who had shunned him because of his background.  Marrying our heroine will get him accepted in society - he thinks.  Then he realizes that one of her conditions would be go give up the very acceptance of the society he so longs for.  Which is stronger - society, or love?   Although this may seem to be a dated issue; and our world today - where everything goes - is a very far cry from the proper London society portrayed in these Regency tales; yet, I found myself identifying with the problem Sir Robert grappled with.   <br /> <br />As a formerly-working, and now stay-at-home mother, I have had to take a hard look at myself, and my value system, when I first had my children.   I, too, had to make that choice.  The choice between being accepted by society, and feeling good about my great job, or doing what is really best for my loved ones - and turning into a nobody in the process.  (People automatically assume, that because I am \\"just a mother\\", that I have no skills, no brains, nothing at all.  What do you do?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Who are you?) Even though I work much harder now than I ever did in the office.  In this story, Sir Robert faces exactly that dilemma  - a choice between being accepted by society, or doing what would be best for \\"the children\\" - and the answer, which may seem like a no-brainer, is actually a much harder one than it seems on the surface.  Indeed, most people, then as now, do make the choice of being accepted by society as opposed to doing what is best for themselves, or their loved ones. <br /> <br />I found this book to be a very enjoyable read.  Thank you, Ms. Kihstrom!  <br />	2004-12-26
US	34914255	RZIJY6KDXN2H9	0451198255	158700400	Birds of a Feather (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Great book, I loved it!	First, a word about the publishers. . . Somewhere it is decreed, I suppose in the Regency genre publishing house, that all \\"Regency Romance\\" books must be exactly 218 pages, no more and no less, so that if one author writes less, they make the letters nice and big, three paragraphs to a page. . . And if another author has a longer story, the publishers will squeeze ten paragraphs, in tiny letters, onto one page. . . This is one of the books where you have ten paragraphs (or more) per page, plus there is so much going on in the story that the plotline is constantly changing . . . for me, this made for some frustrating reading. <br /> <br />But as for the story itself - this is my first by Allison Lane, and what I see, I like.  I was pre-warned that she is a \\"darker\\" Regency author, so that I did not find the issues explored in this story shocking.  Yes, it's sad, but, unfortunately, there really are parents like that.  (Today, since arranged marriages are not really \\"done\\" it will play out in the form of career, or how their children should live their lives. . .)  As for the character of Reggie - he's a really nice, sympathetic character, but I'm afraid that his problem was a real one.  Maybe it's uncommon, and he seems to have had an unusually bad case of it, but it is only today that they have medication for these problems (those who have read the story know which medication I mean).   <br /> <br />I loved the heroine!  I hate to say this, but she sounds so exactly like me, that how can I not have loved this story? <br /> <br />Miss Joanna Patterson was hired as a sort-of companion to Lady Harriet, to launch her into society - and to find her a husband, perferably a rich one.  Being rather plain, awkward, and bespecled besides, Joanna has no such hopes for herself.   <br /> <br />Lord Sedgewick Wylie is not only a dandy, but he is the biggest dandy of them all - actually, he is a social leader.  Always, always, impeccably dressed, always with perfect manners, LordSedgewick is as different from Joanna as could possibly be.  But what society does not know, and would possibly ridicule if they did, is that under that dandified clothing is a smart and educated man - and he is starting to get bored with the society role that he is playing. <br /> <br />In short, this is a couple that is different as could possibly be, and would never have even looked at each other, if fate had not intervened, in not one, not two, but three separate \\"accidents\\" involving each other, the last one culminating in their forced marriage - although \\"marriage\\" for show, and \\"marriage\\" for real are two separate things entirely. . .  <br /> <br />Quite early on in the book, I recognized the plot.  Yes, I was right.  This book has a similar plot to \\"The Viscount who Loved me\\" by Julia Quinn.  I checked the publishing dates to see \\"who cheated\\" but they were published quite closely together, actually this book was first. . . Maybe this is a fairly common Regency plot device, I haven't read enough Regency books to know if this is so or not. <br /> <br />And unlike some previous reviewers, I really liked the character of Lord Sedgewick.  He is a refreshing change from the rakes, and more rakes, that seem to populate all the Regency fare that I have read so far.  Although a dandy, he is responsible, and uses his position in society wisely - he actually tries to help people.  He is not a rake, nor does he gamble in excess, or drink etc. etc.  In short, in many ways a paragon.  And although he does treat the heroine badly at some point in the book, his reasons are very clear, and believable, to me.  Besides, once he gets over his initial reaction, he does apologize, and he even comes to an understanding within himself as to why he treated her this way, and how he will change in the future.  Hey, you can't ask for much better than that.  Even if I am the only one, I do see a very nice future for the rest of their lives together. <br /> <br />I like Allison Lane's style.  I like her complicated plots, I liked her *very\\" complex characters, and I especially liker her *very* realistic portrayal of the issues she has chosen to deal with in this Regency novel.  This is one smart lady, and I really enjoyed her writing.   <br /> <br />I recommend this book for anyone who likes Regencies a bit *darker*, but more realistic, and especially for those who like complicated plots with full-fleshed characters, created by an extremely intelligent author.	2004-12-26
US	34914255	R2VCC3DIEE2BT0	0440442508	184996617	Johnny Tremain	Books	5	44	48	N	N	Poignant and gripping historical novel	I must have read this book ten? twenty? times as a teenager, and so when I found it recently in the basement I started reading again to see if it was really as good as I remembered it.  Better!  \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read, even as an adult.  So imagine my surprise when I noticed that Amazon readers rated this only four stars?    For starters, this is not a children's book.  I see fourth, fifth graders reviewing this book, as part of an assignment - and as a mother myself, this bothers me.  This is a great book - but, I think, way over a fifth-graders head.  Maybe *your* fifth-grader is brilliant and will absolutely understand everything completely - but for a classroom setting?  What are these teachers thinking?    But for a teenager - \\"Johnny Tremain\\" brings to life the times of the Revolutionary War era as no other book, or history lesson, possibly can.  Couple that with a brilliantly portrayed cast of characters - complex, vivid characters - and exceptionally vivid, emotional and fast paced writing - and you have the ingredients for a really good book.  Maybe I am prejudiced - I love historicals, and always did, but perhaps it is the other way around - perhaps \\"Johnny Tremain\\" influenced me in the way that this book showed me how fascinating history can be.    \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is the story of a boy - fourteen years old - who is apprenticed to a silversmith, whom he calls his \\"master\\".  As an exceptionally capable, talented young man - not to mention an exceptional aptitude with silver - he quickly steps into his master's family to find his niche as the head of the household - if not in name, then in actions (beint that his master is elderly).  But how easily are the mighty fallen! For Johnny burns his hand on hot silver and, medicine (or midwifery) being what it was, it never healed properly.  A future as a silversmith is out.  Overnight, Johnny went from being a capable, bright boy with an exceptional future aheadof him to a nobody.      While this is an excellent story about Johnny, it is the times that he lived in that makes this book such riveting reading.  Not only do we get to meet all the famous people who populate pre-Revolutionary Boston, we also get an excellent, clear picture of the everyday life of the people of that era.  The way they lived, the things they ate, the way they operated - almost everything is touched upon in this extra-ordinary novel.     Johnny Tremain somehow gets tangled with the Boston patriots - and is right there in the thick of things just as the Revolutionary War has started.  This is the only part of the novel that I found a bit too coincidental - but extremely interesting, nevertheless.    \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is one of the best books ever written, but would more easily be appreciated and understood by an older student, in my opinion.  Happy reading!	2004-12-23
US	34914255	R3IQZAALAHGHKB	0451204832	789512299	The Marriage Masquerade (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Very well written, but spoiled by an unlikely romance	I wanted to like this book.  I really did.  As I started it, I thought - I've finally got it - a five star Regency.  Beautifully written, with a true Regency \\"flavor\\" spicing up the story (she uses real Regency words, as opposed to our vernacular), and an unusual and interesting beginning (Queen Charlotte's goddaughter?), and I was all set for a really good read.  Unfortunately, as I kept reading, I found myself losing first one star - for the slow pace and lack of plot of the story, and then two, for a romance that at first was only unbelievable, and then offended me. <br /> <br />The writing, however, remained quite stable throughout - and even though, as a previous reviewer pointed out - the narrative starts and stops in funny places (one obvious example is when the author spends two pages on wondering how they will get home, without a carriage - and twenty pages later, they are somehow going home, in a carriage - who's carriage?  Where did it come from?  That should have been explained).)  But on the whole, this did not detract from the writing of the book, which remained elegant and pleasant throughout. <br /> <br />The story starts with Lady Lucianne and her godmother, Queen Charlotte.  Queen Charlotte is making a masquerade, and she \\"persuades\\" Lucianne that she must come.  Lucianne has just broken her engagement, and is now facing the humiliation of a fourth (fifth?) season.  Queen Charlotte has resolved to re-install Lucianne's reputation, and, better yet - marry her off quickly, perferably all this happening at her ball.  (This alone seems quite contrived - why DOES Queen Charlotte care so much about Lucianne's social standing?  And why such a hurry to marry?  Plenty of Regency, or other era of English history, women never got married (indeed, Jane Austen comes to mind).  The only reason I can see is that we are reading a \\"romance\\" novel, did Queen Charlotte realize that she was acting only to be helpful to this author?) <br /> <br />Lord Victor Oxenby isLucianne's brother's friend, and they know each other well, however, they have had a falling out somewhere along the way and are no longer on speaking terms.  Yet at the Masquerade, it is Lord Victor Oxenby's name that is pulled out of the hat, along with Lady Lucianne's as reigning Lord and Lady of the ball. <br /> <br />And here's where I found fault - firstly, when it was related to us what terrible thing Lady Lucianne had done to make things akward between them - the actual awful and hateful thing that she had said - I found myself thinking - my, my, that's it?  Lord Victor must have a very thin skin, indeed.  When you are constantly living with a disability, you become sort of immune to people's reactions to it - at least if you wouldn't - you would have nobody left to talk to, that's all.   <br /> <br />Which brings me to my second point - Lord Victor has a scar across his face, and he limps, as a result of a childhood accident that involved a horse.  He is preoccupied with his scar.  He talks only about his scar (or at least the author does).  He is extremely sensitive about his scar, and he is so preoccupied with it (at least in the book) to the point that it is the scar and the limp that defines his every action.  I felt like yelling at him - get a life!  Get something, anything, to think about besides your scar!  Thankfully, this is not at all a real portrayal of the norm, as most of the people I know who have had to deal with an infirmity or a disability have tried their best to live as normally as possible, to live their lives to the fullest they can, within their limitations.  So that I think that Ms. Tesjerdian actually does a disservice to handicapped or disfigured people by their portrayal in this book. <br /> <br />This is not because I have any animosity, or fear of crippled or scarred people, in fact, it is just the oppposite.  I had a close family member who was in a wheelchair for many years, and this is exactly the attitude that people had thatI hated - they would identify her in their mind as \\"the wheelchair\\".  The fact that she was a real person, with complex emotions, thoughts, and attitudes - just like anybody else - did not enter anyone's head.  But she definitely did her best to live her life as fully as she was able to - and cheerfully, too - to defy as much as possible \\"that monster\\" which was her disease.  And I do think, that most people (at least the better ones) do react that way, hence I found this part of the book a bit unbelievable. <br /> <br />I think Ms. Desjardien DID try to write this book with sensitivity - and did try to present Victor as a real person, and obviously, since she picked him as her hero, she was trying to make a point, to discuss a sensitive subject in a caring way.   But I feel that she failed in her objective - she should have done some real live research instead of going by how she felt it should be handled - very often the way other people deal with a person with a disability and the way the victim himself feels about it are two different things.  <br /> <br />My third problem was with the romance itself - the wedding seemed a bit too contrived to me.  And maybe its just me - but I didn't feel that the h/h had totally resolved their differences, or had made complete peace with their situation - last time I looked, she was still tiptoeing around his disability.  I also found it hard to understand why she at last fell in love with him - is there anything, anything at all, that she actually *liked* about Victor, that would make her fall in love with him?  No, all we know about him is his scar.  All we hear is that she fell in love with him *despite* his scar.  This was not a satisfactory ending to me. <br /> <br />While a well-written and interesting read, I disagreed with how the author handled the issues she decided to tackle in this book, and that is the reason for my grading this book three stars.	2004-12-23

This was my first story by April Kihlstrom, and I was impressed by some aspects of this Regency - I liked the characters she created, they seemed like real people and all did believable (to me) things, and the plotting was quite good, too.  I really liked the character of \\"Miss Tibble\\" - this is the first time that I have encountered her, and I am looking forward to finding some other books *about* Miss Tibble.  And there was quite a good storyline, with plenty of different threads running through it, and I liked the ending - although a bit dark, it was still realistic.  And all was resolved pretty well, I thought.   <br /> <br />However, it still did not come together for me for as an enjoyable read, and I really wondered why.  Perhaps it was the writing that was missing something, the disjointed way that all the many plot-lines were presented, or the too-quick ending where all the various threads were joined together in just a few pages.  Whatever it was, although this story had a lot of potential, it was missing that \\"spark\\" that makes a really good read. <br /> <br />But I will definitely be on the look-out for other books by Ms. Kihlstrom - the characterization and plot of this book were excellent, and perhaps in another book her writing is improved. <br />	2004-12-23

It was certainly a pleasant read, and even though some other reviewers complained about the extra-ordinary amount of kidnappings I did not find that a terribly impossible scenario - I think it was just the way it was dealt with that made it come across as a little unlikely. <br /> <br />In this book, we have Alexandra, one of Candace Camp's independent and self-possessed heroines, meet Lord Sebastian Thorpe.  Alexandra's family owns a shipping company, and she uses business as an excuse to visit Lord Sebastian - as she really wants to see his Indian collection.  As is on par for Ms. Camp's heroines, she refuses to be cowed by the haughty and ufriendly Lord Sebastian, and Sebastian responds well to her methods, so that at the end, we have a match. <br /> <br />Maybe it was just me, but I just could never quite warm up to Alexandra, or Sebastian.  I never quite found that \\"spark\\" in either of them that would make me want to read more about them, nor did I find their characters to get developed in any meaningful way.  As a result, I think that for me this book pretty much rested on the plot, which was okay, but not enough to keep me riveted to the page. <br /> <br />I really like Candace Camp's writing style, and there was nothing particularly jarring about this story, but in the end there was nothing to really recommend this book either.  A pleasant, but average read, only three stars.	2004-12-16
US	34914255	R3SU6J852CRR1D	0312983824	347731978	Faking It	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Nobody tops Jennifer Crusie for humor	I just read another book by Jennifer Crusie, \\"Getting Rid of Bradley\\", and I thought that that one was the best and funniest book I have ever read, until I read \\"Faking It\\".  If a book can be better than five star, this one is it.   <br /> <br />What this book is about is fun.  Not complex characterizations, not suspense, not serious stuff.  It's not even meant to be realistic.  (It IS a little strange that all the Goodnight's tenants become part of the family.)  But isn't that part of the charm of the Goodnights - all kinds of weird and crazy things happen to them, things that will never happen to the rest of us serious and responsible and normal people, because they really aren't serious and responsible and normal.   <br /> <br />This is a REALLY funny book, Jennifer Crusie is a great writer.  She writes great one-liners, and when I try to remember them to repeat it, I can't.  I get the words wrong, the tone wrong - it doesn't come out right, somehow.  But in this book, it's perfect! <br /> <br />I am a quick reader, and usually can finish a book in two-three hours, but Faking It took me three days.  Not because it didn't pull me - I was walking around with it all day just waiting for that minute or two on hold that I could sneak another page, but because each word is saying something.  If you skip a page or two, you lose the thread of the story, plus you lose out on some really good dialogue.  So I had to read each word, and then go back and read the page again, just to make sure I got everything straight.  This is actually NOT a bad thing, it's a sign of good writing, that she could make each word count.  Some writers could spend thirty pages just describing one scene - and while that's not a bad thing necessarily, I think Jennifer Crusie is the more brilliant writer.  And it happens that I really enjoyed this book in a way that I haven't enjoyed a book in a long time. <br /> <br />I did NOT think that there were too many characters, it made things more interesting.  You just have to read more slowly to get everthing straight, and that's more pages of fun, isn't it? <br /> <br />My favorite scene in this book? The part where Davy is giving Dilly a lesson on salesmanship (is that what it was?)  Dilly is a quick learner, and promptly turned the table on Davy. <br /> <br />If you have a sense of humor, like to laugh, and can suspend disbelief for a few hours, you will really enjoy this book.  If you like funny, quirky characters, you will really enjoy this book.  If you love brilliant dialogue, (and the book is mostly dialogue), you will really enjoy this book.  But if you are looking for a serious book with complex, deep characters, or a book that is on the darker, or more suspenseful side, there are plenty of other authors for you to try.  For the rest of us, thank you, Jennifer Crusie!	2004-12-02
US	34914255	R22084U7VBGY2Y	1551668653	684993289	Getting Rid Of Bradley	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Funny bone required	Despite having seen Jennifer Crusie come up time and again on reviewer's favorite lists, I didn't buy them right away.  I think that's because humor is a relative thing, but many times I have read a book that other people have found funny, but I was thinking \\"Where's the humor?\\"  I finally gave it a plunge on \\"Getting Rid of Bradley\\" and much to my surprise, this book was really FUNNY!  This is a book full of zany people doing zany things, and everywhere they turn, something zany happens to them.  They are funny, but they are likable too.  It's hard not to feel sorry for our heroine - while some of us could have an unlucky day, there's nothing like having an unlucky LIFE to make you feel really, really, really down in the dumps!  I loved the people, I loved the dialogue, I loved the hero/heroine, I just thought they were sweet.       The book starts off with our heroine deciding that she's finally finished letting everyone else tell her what to do, and now that her divorce is final, she'll tell her busy body sister that she's now in charge of her own destiny.  Right away we are getting a bad feeling, and yes, as they say in Murphy-land, everything that could go wrong promtly goes wrong. What we end up with is an hilarious tale of cops and robbers, and what the reader gets out of this is three hours of laughs, plus a really happy ending (did you ever see a guy fall in love with a woman with green hair?  Not grass green, but slime green?  When that happens, you know it's for keeps.)    It's funny, but the style of this book reminds me a bit of Rex Stout's Archie Goodwin.  (This is an older book, for those who don't know him).  But unlike Rex Stout, the plot of the murder mystery is really hardly anything to write home about.  Especially the Bradly part - I kept waiting for some tie-in as why they are both Bradley - but it never happened.  It seems that it was just a coincidence - that's just a little bit too coincidental, even for a book that's not based in too strongly in reality.    This book is definitely recommended to anyone who like to laugh.	2004-12-02

This was my first book by Andrea Pickens, and, if this book is any indication, she is so good that I would easily buy any of her books, sight unseen.      The book is so well written, her language is so appropriate and elegant, that I found myself reading it slowly simply to savor the sentences, the word structure, and the beautiful word play.  (Andrea Pickens tends to do a lot of *play on words*, and I found myself looking out for these - is it puns?  I don't know the exact English term, but it was something I've never seen before in a novel.)    The Viscount Marquand is as different from his parents as could be.  Having grown up with their excesses in everything - drinking and gambling,etc - and watching the effects of their loose lifestyle on themselves, on those around them, and especially, on the family's coffers, the Viscount has determined that only by acting exactly the opposite of his parents in every way, will he have a happy and well-ordered life.  So the beginning of this book finds the Viscount on the verge of becoming fianceed to the perfect bride - one whom he has decided will suit him from every angle - on paper.  But his well-ordered life is about to come crashing down on his head when he finds that his father has done something exceptionally foolish, something he has promised his son he would never do, and now it is up to the Viscount to save his ancestral home with - of all things - a game of chance.  The game being golf.  So off the Viscount goes to Scotland, to ace this sport as easily has he done everything else - after all, how hard can it be to strike a ball - a *stationary* ball?  But of course nothing goes as planned, as he finds that neat columns on paper and neat columns in real life are two separate things. . .      The characters, both the central ones and the background characters, were very well drawn and I found myself liking all of them (except for the villain, of course).  Even the Earl of Chittendom, Marquand's father, was reallya likeable, if weak fellow.  I found myself feeling for Marquand (our hero), when, even when he feels satisfied that everything was planned to perfection, is left with a niggling feeling that perhaps his plan has a hole in it?  Perhaps what he thinks is the correct course is really not?  And I did not think that the villain is too one-dimensional.  To be honest, a villain, to be a real villain, must of necessity be quite shallow - are there any redeeming qualities to [...]?  To Stalin?  Or to any other blood-thirsty dictators or serial murderers that history has encountered?  Truthfully, if there were any good sides to any of these people, I for one would not want to know about it.  He killed and tortured and maimed thousands of people yet he's a kind man because he once fed a hungry dog?  Please.  In my opinion, at least, it is actually the regular people who are multi-dimensional, who try to do the right thing, at least some of the time, who succeed sometimes, sometimes not.  So, I for one am all for one-dimensional villains.  Sometimes people kill just because, or rob just because, and as hard as it is for decent people to understand this - ask a serial killer why he has twenty bodies stuffed in his basement - what did these people do to him?  Society calls him mad, because we can't fathom this, but is he mad, or does he just like to kill?  (As some people like eating chocolate ice-cream, for instance).  In any case, I seem to have gone way off topic, I think Andrea Pickens has written a very fine book, exceptionally well-written, with well-drawn, and likeable characters.    So why the four stars?  Since most of the book is about golf, the game, the strategy, and the origins thereof, and I don't play golf (never did, and probably never will), I found myself somewhat bored by the extremely detailed descriptions of the game.  I certainly did get a bit of an education, never mind, but having had no first hand knowledge of the game handicapped me somewhat, so to speak.  Also, maybe it was just me, but I found the story a bit slow paced - not much plot, once you get past the first few chapters, but a very enjoyable read nevertheless.    Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys exceptional quality writing, and a sweet happily-ever-after for all the character involved (except the villain, of course).	2004-11-24
US	34914255	ROXN439KAMBEW	0440226007	880815333	One Night for Love (Bedwyn Saga)	Books	4	27	32	N	N	Beautifully written, but a somewhat hard story to read	In many ways, this is one of Mary Balogh's best books.  It is beatifully written, with a strong sense of emotion throughout.  But I found that I really didn't like it, and even stopped reading the story halfway through when I first read this book a year ago.  I came back to this book when I started \\"A Summer to Remember\\" and realized that Lauren, the heroine of that book, is the same Lauren as \\"One Night for Love\\".  I enjoyed this story more the second time around, when I realized that Lauren will have a happy ending eventually, and I also found it helpful in understanding \\"A Summer to Remember\\".  While Lauren is first introduced in this book, she is definitely a developed person here, and it makes \\"A Summer to Remember\\" much more meaningful when I have already met Lauren in the previous book.    But I still didn't like this book too much.  Not because this is not well written - this is probably one of the most beautifully written books that I have ever read.  Just that it is so sad, in so many ways.    Every romance book has to have an impediment to everlasting happiness between the h/h - otherwise there wouldn't be a story.  Sometimes outside forces (the easiest way to accomplish this is when they are from different worlds - class differences in an historical novel, or in a contemporary - different ways of life - construction worker/intellectual, rich/poor, etc.), sometimes it is the personalities of the two people themselves, oh, the list can be quite long depending on the ingenuity of the writer herself.  In this book there are quite a few obstacles to everlasting happiness between Neville, our hero, and Lily, who is the designated heroine of this book.  So many obstacles, in fact, that they at first seem unsurmountable, and it is only your faith in a writer such as Mary Balogh that all will be resolved at the end that keeps you reading.  However, I did wonder, many times - so many obstacles?  Can she really resolve them all to my satisfaction?  Perhaps I am a bit picky, but in this case she did not.  They were not all resolved totally to my satisfaction.  This is a very common sensation that I get from reading other novels, other authors, but coming from Mary Balogh, it was a real let-down.     Firstly, there is Lily, herself.  Can she, a sergeant's daughter, used to the rough-and-tumble life of the army, where survival is the only essential rule of the game, acclimate to the very different life of the ton?  At first it seems that not only does the family have a problem with her non-manners, she finds it the many rules and regulations of the upper class stifling.     Second, there is the slight problem of Neville himself - whom does he love - Lily or Lauren?  He did marry Lily, but that was a quickie wedding, and he WAS about to marry Lauren, in a huge society wedding.  Neville had married Lily in the battle-camp, on the day of her father's death, because he had promised her father to protect her, and marriage seemed the most promising way to accomplish that fact.  They were married that day, had one night of *love*, hence the title.  The next day in battle, Neville was injured, and Lily was declared dead.  But does Neville really love Lily? Or Lauren, his intended bride?    Then there are the minor problems.  While Lily loves Neville, and the thought of his love kept her going throughout her year in captivity, now that she is here she is not at all sure that she belongs here, as Neville's wife, nor is she still sure that her love is returned.  When at the time of their marriage, she did realize there was a class difference, at the time she did not realize just how very deep that difference really was.  Never would she have imagined that Neville is really an Earl, with a huge estate, and now she will have to be a Countess.  Will she ever be able to fit in to his life, in the way that Lauren would have?  Does Neville love her?  Did he ever really love her?  Did he once love her but now rather loves Lauren?  What is motivating him to acknowledge Lily as his wife, perhaps it is only his sense of honor?    And there is Lily herself.  It is obvious, in this story, that she is miserable trying her best to be good wife to Neville, to fit into his life, and she is failing.  Not only does she have no idea how to behave as a Countess, the very idea of conforming to the strict rules and regulations of the English upper class seems horrifying and stifling to her.  Never to feel the wind or the sun on your face, or water between your toes, never to have the freedom of movement that she has until now taken for granted, can she ever be happy in such a life?    And then there is the problem of society around her.  Will they ever accept her totally as Neville's  wife, as his Countess?    And what about Lauren, although not the heroine of our story, it seems so not fair, somehow, that her life should be disrupted in this way.  Part of the reason that I could not finish this book the first time I read it was because I really got to like Lauren, and therefore I had a hard time dealing with, and liking Lily.  I thought that Lauren dealt with the whole situation with class, and even though Mary Balogh tried to make her look in the wrong as she was not dealing with her feelings, I thought she was acting beautifully.  Not only that, but I felt bad for Lily, being forced into a situation that she did not seem equipped, nor did she seem happy to deal with.  Nor did I feel in Lily the heroine that Ms. Balogh usually does such a good job potraying.  While there were many good parts to Lily, her main claim to fame seemed that she embraced the physical world around her, in a way that her more sheltered English counterparts did not, but that seems more a product of her upbringing rather than a goodness from within Lily herself.        Also, I did not feel equipped to judge Lauren.  Although by our standards she seems repressed and unhappy, I that Lauren was very much a product of her upbringing and environment.Certainly, she fit into what was expected of her, and always acting properly in every way and at every time, being every inch the lady, she assumes that this will bring her happiness in the world that she lives in.  By the end of this book, she finds out differently.  Although she has always played by the rules, the rules have let her down, and she ends up with nothing.  In the next book, \\"A Summer to Remember\\", Lauren deals with the fact that living for other's expectations has only brought her unhappiness until now, and she starts thinking and living for herself, she starts to realize that acting by the rules is not always best, and we see a metamorphosis happening in Lauren.  But in this book, we only see Lauren's unhappiness, her saddness, we are witness to her realization that Neville and Lily have something that until now she did not even know existed, and this is what causes her to finally come to terms with her feelings.      While I think that this was a necessary part of Lauren's growth, still, I felt bad for her, and actually, I felt bad for both of them - Lily, and Lauren - each one wondering what the other has that they themselves don't have.  Lauren thinks - he loves Lily more, there is more passion, and Lily thinks - I could never be Lauren, I could never fit into his world as well as Lauren does.  And Neville himself is not sure what he wants, while passion is good, there is the all the rest of their lives to consider, Lauren fits in his life better, perhaps there is passion underneath as well?  Lily and Lauren are torn, Neville himself is torn - this is a very hard novel to read.  (When Lily asks Neville - if you heard I was dead, why didn't you check to make sure?  If you loved me, why did you marry Lauren so easily a year later?  And Neville does not answer.  Perhaps he is not sure himself).    All in all, Mary Balogh has placed so many obstacles to this couples true happily-ever-after that I simply could not see a happy ending, which is why I hadstopped reading it halfway through.  This time around, I did finish it, and I'm still not sure about the ending.  While many obstacles were indeed overcome, and very happily so, others did not seem totally resolved to my satisfaction.  We are now sure of Neville's love, and Ms. Balogh has determined that the ton will now happily accept Lily, but will Lily ever be happy in her new life?  Or will she always yearn for the freedom of being able to what she wants when she wants to, as she was used to doing?  (Remember \\"The Prince and Pauper\\"?)  I don't think this is an issue that is so easily resolved, this was definitely a theme that recurred throughout history, of both men and women that were high-born and having to deal with the fact that they could not do what they wanted when they wanted, in fact this is the theme of many an historical novel.    In any case, I am not sure why not playing the piano, embroidering, etc. are so badly a detriment to Lily's future happiness.  If I remember my history correctly, weren't there many *eccentric* men and women of the nobility, who did not fit into any mold at all?  I wonder if we have an incorrect assumption as to what life was like in those days.  While it's true that perhaps in London it was expected of one to conform to the ton, I wonder if the same was true for those who lived most of their lives in the country, who never went past *riding* or *hunting*.  To be accepted in society in London it was true that there were many nuances to adopt, but perhaps life in the country was different?  And while the restrictions on a single woman in England were stifling, I think that married women did have more freedom.  But in any case, even with all this, women did have many stifling rules that were not there for the men.  Women in England were so sheltered, that Lily simply does not enjoy it.  The real question, which Ms. Balogh does not ask, did anybody?  Did women simply put up with the restrictions in return for other gains - financial security, glittering balls, elegant houses, prestige?  In any case, Ms. Balogh takes it as a given that Lily would have been happier in her old life, but perhaps that would not have been true.  As a single woman earning her own keep, having to work as a companion or a governess, or worse, never being allowed to voice an opinion, simply being a workhorse for those over her, at best, at worse a whipping-boy for a cruel and vindictive master/mistress, is learning the rules of a Countess so very hard?  If she would have to work for her living, would she have time to wade in the water, run outside, or \\"just be\\"?  Speaking as a working woman myself, I don't think so.  (Wouldn't I love some time in my life to \\"just be\\").  So in any case what Lily is giving up is not so very much, really.  I would have liked if Ms. Balogh would have dealt with this reality more in her story, but the way she dealt with is a bit shallow, and I'm sorry, when I know that she could, and has done, better.    And Lauren.  Although Lauren is dealt with in the next novel, which makes us all happier for her, she is never truly the same person.  Everything that she has ever believed in has exploded around her, and in order to find her own happiness she will now have to redefine who she is, she will have to remake Lauren from the inside out.  While this makes for an in-depth character analysis, and emotion-laden reading, I can't help wondering why we had to have Lauren go through this, why couldn't she have been just left to live her life the way she thought it had to be lived, and end her days that way?  (As thousands of women around her did.)    All in all, while this was definitely a well-written story, but as far as true emotional depth, of true emotional growth, I think that Mary Balogh has done better.  Read \\"A Thief of Dreams\\" for a truly beatiful blossoming of character to become a better person, or \\"Truly\\" for a real love story - or \\"More Than a Mistress\\" or \\"No Man's Mistress\\" for a real believable happy ending.  I'm sorry, Ms. Balogh, but I thought \\"One Night for Love\\" and the story of Neville, Lily, and Lauren, was one of her more shallow works.  And one of the saddest.    **** When I originally wrote this review, I did something that I always condemned in others - I wrote a review without reading the book properly - or rather, the ending.  I re-read the ending after I had written the review, and I realized that Mary Balogh did reconcile all the problems - and she did do it brilliantly.  With other authors if you skim through a few pages, you usually don't lose anything in the storyline - but in this case every page did count in the build-up in the ending.  This was a novel that was brilliantly done, brilliantly written, and I say that even though I started and stopped this novel more than once, once I finally finished this novel to the end, I got my reward in this beautiful resolution to the story.  I still think, though, that it really was in some ways a sad story, I had always liked Lauren, and found that Neville and Lily's happiness were always shadowed by the very dramatic public humiliation of Lauren.  But that's just my opinion.	2004-11-22

What keeps pulling me back again and again?  Simply put, it is the people in her books.  These are not made-up-characters for a novel or a movie, but these are real people! I like the fact that she doesn't make her characters perfect - they don't act like they're on a stage, but rather they do and say things the way people *really* would in real life. In Debbie Macomber's books, I always recognize all the people I know - friends, relatives, my neighbor-next-door - and more times than I would care to admit, I recognize myself! It is these flawed but real characters that keep drawing me to her books, again and again and again.    In Dakota Born, Debbie Macomber introduces us to the dying farm community of Buffalo Valley, and as we slowly get to know each of the people in the community, we come to care about them - and understand their lives, their hopes, their dreams - not to mention the staple of all her books - the romance and sweet happily ever after.  And as I was reading further into the book, I was rooting for this farm community to blossom and grow, and being that this is Debbie Macomber, I'm sure that this is exactly what will happen! Being a city girl born and bred, I found it fascinating to read about the people who live in these rural areas - the backbone and bread-and-butter of America.  Ms. Macomber made me realize how hard their lives are - yet rewarding as well.  And I have this overwhelming urge to write to all these important government officials to tell them to give the farmers better prices for their grain and corn!    I love Debbie Macomber, and I love her books.  I am trying to buy them all (instead of getting them from the library), so that I can read them over and over again.  Dakota Born is one of her very best books, with all theelements that make her so very much loved by her fans.	2004-11-18
US	34914255	R2VL8PIK94N8EL	0451191439	297106011	The Temporary Wife	Books	5	11	12	N	N	The best of the best!	This book has been so well reviewed previously, that it seems almost superfluous to add my own thoughts, but I will say it anyway:  Read \\"The Temporary Wife\\" (if you can get it) to see why Mary Balogh has become the best in this genre.  This book is simply one of the best that she has written, simply one of the best books that there is. <br /> <br />This is a great book on every level; her writing style is beautiful and flows easily, *pulling* you in to the story.  From the minute I picked up this book, I simply couldn't put it down until I had finished the entire book.  Her characters are very likeable and very complex (unusual for a Regency novel), and she introduces so many *heavy* topics that you can almost get dizzy trying to keep track of them all.  Being Mary Balogh, she tackles these topics with exceptional understanding and sensitivity, and I was left with a lot of food for thought.  In The Temporary Wife, Mary Balogh explores the complex relationship of father and son (why do parents treat their children badly if they really do love them so?), the complexities of an arranged marriage (is it the parties responsibility to *make* their own happiness, or not?), and the dangers of confiding too much to your children (as we see the pitfalls in this story).  She shows us an unhappy family, and as we get to understand the complexities of the relationship of any family, especially this family, she also shows us that their is more than two sides to every issue, more than two sides to a coin.  I have never seen any of these issues *ever* explored in any other Regency novel, and particularly not in this way, where each side is presented in its entirety.  She shows us why everyone does act the way they do, until at the end, you find yourself without a villian to blame for this very messy tangle of an unhappy family.   <br /> <br />Since this a shorter Regency novel, these topics are only very lightly skimmed, however, as she quickly steers us towards the ending for thehappily-ever-after.  While in many Regency novels, I get the feeling that the author is scrounging around for something to fill up the pages, in this novel, the feeling I get is just the opposite - Mary Balogh has so much to say, and so many topics to explore, that in order to cram them all in there is a somewhat superficial discussion of these issues (not to say that in this book she is superficial, rather, compared to what I have seen Mary Balogh do in some of her other books, I know that she has more to say).  Wouldn't I like to see this book reprinted and expanded!!!  (Publishers, are you listening????) <br /> <br />Mary Balogh does not need my praise.  This book speaks for itself as one of the very best of its kind.  An enjoyable and thought-provoking read - if you can get hold of it.	2004-11-18

Too often after reading a biography of one of my favorite authors I found that their lives did not quite measure up to their books, but with this author I found quite the opposite, I found myself in awe of this modest and unassuming man. <br /> <br />My first reaction upon finishing this book was how unusually nice it is for a son to write so well of his father, and it certainly made me stop and think about my relationship with my own children.  What greater tribute can a person have that his children should think so highly of them, should write with such love and devotion about a parent?  How rare it is today (or at least psychologists would have us believe that it is rare) for a son to follow in his father's profession, working in the same practice, living just miles away, with hardly an unkind word for his father? <br /> <br />This book is an anti-dote for all those \\"dark\\" books, where the worst of human nature is emphasized again and again, and it is refreshing to read about a \\"normal\\", happy person, with a devoted wife and family, a humble and modest man who succeeded in life beyond his wildest dreams.  A man who, upon making millions when his books hit the bestseller list, refused to change his lifestyle one iota, preferring to continue in the vocation and place (the Yorkshires) he loved rather than turn into one of the \\"rich and famous\\".

I belong to the latter group.  There are some similarities, of course - they both write about the Regency era, and they are both very faithful in the depiction of the time period they write about, but I am afraid that in my opinion that is all they have in common.    Georgette Heyer's books were written many years ago, and the flavor and style of her books are certainly very different from those written with the contemporary hand of Marion Chesney.  Heyer concentrates on manners and dress, while Chesney is usually more focused on the minutae of everyday living in the Regency era - and does a good job describing the very different mindset of those people of long ago, as opposed to the modern way of thinking.  While Heyer writes mainly about the upper classes, Marion Chesney will often focus on the lower classes - something, I might add, which I have never seen before in a Regency novel, and find engrossing for that reason alone.  Heyer is probably a better writer - but that is not an insult to Chesney - while Heyer is simply a classic, Chesney is certainly one of the best of the writers in today's Regency Romance genre.  The fact that there is a comparison made at all is a compliment to Ms. Chesney, though, I think.    While I liked both Georgette Heyer and Marion Chesney, they are very different writers, and I can see how someone who loves Georgette Heyer may not like Marion Chesney, and vice versa (although I can't quite imagine someone not liking Georgette Heyer).    In \\"Emily Goes to Exeter\\" we are introduced to Miss Hannah Pym, a former housekeeper who has come into a small inheritance and decided to use her money on her life-long ambition.  All her life she has watched the \\"Flying Machine\\" pass by her window, and finally she will have the chance of her own for Adventure!  For Living Life!    I thought this was one of Marion Chesney's bestbooks, Miss Hannah comes across as a very vivid and sympathetic character, and we are caught up in her until-now dull life, the sad life of her former employees, and finally her chance for adventure.  Nor does Ms. Chesney let her down, as in page after page, there is never a dull moment!    If you are a Regency fan, you will certainly like \\"Miss Emily Goes to Exeter\\" as this is one of the best regencies in today's market.	2004-11-17

While others may think travelling on the stagecoach to be boring and uncomfortable, Miss Pym is delighted that she is finally fulfilling her life-long ambition! <br /> <br />This second volume I did not find as riveting as the first, although it was interesting and the book certainly did not let me down.  Ms. Chesney has a talent for plot and characterizations - not for Ms. Chesney is the long drawn out explanations of emotions or detailed setting, rather there action, and lots of it, on every page.  And we have Ms. Chesney's many (and \\"on the mark\\") observations of human nature.  Through the person of Miss Pym - who fixes the problem of poor Mrs. Judd, while saving both her marriage and pocketbook, we get many pithy comments on the state of human nature in general.  And, as to be expected by the title of the book, Miss Pym uses all her wiles and knowledge of human nature to get Belinda settled with the \\"right\\" man.  (Goodness, doesn't she sound just like Miss Marple?) <br /> <br />But what about Miss Pym's life?  Why does a life of Adventure on the Flying Machine seem suddenly to feel flat and dull - what is that emotion that is ignited in Miss Pym's breast as she watches the happy, newly wedded, couple?  What about some romance for Miss Pym?  I suppose over the next five books, we will find out. <br /> <br />An entertaining story, with lots of plot twists and Ms. Chesney's signature \\"tongue-in-cheek\\", sure to please any Regency fan. <br /> <br />	2004-11-17

He has the tools and the know-how, and he did his research.  He made one fatal error, however.  Actually he made not one, but two mistakes.  The first mistake is that his starting point is wrong.  As a trained journalist, he does as a journalist does - he keeps trying to find \\"dirt\\", or rather manufacture dirt - all in order to give us a \\"balanced view\\".  One can't help feeling, as one reads interview after interview, that Mr. Lord has somehow picked only the disgruntled, caustic and jealous remarks to print.  The second mistake was in underestimating \\"James Herriot\\"'s fans, and familys goodwill towards him.  He treats his subject manner as just another subject, as routine grist for the gossip mill, but Alf Wight was not that kind of person. He was a person totally out of Mr. Lord's scope and understanding.  He underestimated Mr. Wight's fans and family's tolerance for having his name besmearched, and, indeed, his son wrote another book in response, a beautiful book about his father, and in it he easily refutes all Mr. Lord's accusations - and turns Mr. Lord into a laughingstock.  Because anybody who has read the two books side by side - which I just did - would realize that Mr. Lord has indeed made a laughingstock of himself. <br /> <br />While there are some good parts to the book, they are very much overshadowed by the other parts.  There are two good chapters - in the middle - which were written factually - the chapters dealing with the content of James Herriot's first books, and the publishing history.  There is a good reason why this is so - Mr. Lord was indeed part of the publishing business and would have been privy to that sort of information.   <br /> <br />But much of the book is exactly what he accuses James Herriot of writing - pure fiction.  It would take too long to point out every one of Mr. Lord's mistakes, but I would like to simply write just a few of the many mistakes Mr. Lord makes.  The rest, if you still want to read this book, you could find out for yourself. <br /> <br />The first accusation Mr. Lord makes about James Herriot is that Alf Wight did not write a semi-autobiography, but rather pure fiction.  He maintains that even if this were so, it would not matter, because the books are still entertaining.  With that salve to his conscience, he methodically starts to take apart many stories in an effort to prove them fiction.   <br /> <br />His first assertion - that it would not matter if it were actually fiction, is simply not true.  It would matter, and matter a lot, to both his fans and friends and family.  His son says as much in his book- that it would matter a lot if his books are fiction.  Fortunately for us, Mr. Lord does not bring a single proof that could stand up to scrutiny.  His method seems to be - I don't think this story is true, so it's probably not.  That's it.  Not one single proof.  For instance, he says that Alf Wight's memoirs of his war years are fiction - because the dates are wrong.  He says that Alf Wight joined the army in March, 1941, and was discharged two years later, and therefore his story that he was called up to the RAF while his wife was expecting their first child is a fictional story.  His son, in his book \\"The Real James Herriot\\" explains that he enlisted in the RAF in March, but was NOT CALLED UP until 15 months later, in November 1942, when his wife was indeed, expecting their first child.  Is it possible his son and wife might know when he joined the RAF better than Mr. Lord?  Especially since Mr. Lord actually admits that he is going from hearsay - since the RAF would not give Mr. Lord access to their records, claiming that they were still classified?  This should be enough of a blooper to discredit Mr. Lord; however, there are many, many more - so many that it would be funny if it were not also very, very sad that someone could so easily print a book full of lies and get away with it (by prefacing all his explanationswith \\"perhaps\\" he covers himself from libel, I suppose). <br /> <br />Another example of Mr. Lord's innuendos -  he quotes from one of Mr. Herriot's books that James Herriot was taken aback by the red (and squished) face of his newborn son, and asked the nurse if there was something wrong with the child.  Mr. Lord asks how can this story be true if he is a vet?  Just so, explains his son, animals are born much more fully formed than humans are.  (A horse is born already able to walk as soon as he is born).  Mr. Lord falls flat in the mud. <br /> <br />Mr. Lord quotes James Herriot as saying that 90% of his stories are based on real life.  Mr. Lord asks how that can  be - when the Herriot books say that he joined Seigfried's practice in 1937, when he actually started working there in 1941?  Mr. Lord, I think we are ready for a lesson in English.  Do you know what the words \\"based on true life\\" means?  \\"Based\\" means \\"based\\", not \\"actually, exactly, fact\\".  When he first started writing, he was hoping to remain anonymous, and therefore disguised his stories so that the people he was writing about would not recognize themselves.  He changed the location of his practice to the Dales, he changed the dates, he even changed the characters - some from a man to a woman, for example.  He put two stories into one, etc. etc.  This all falls under the heading of \\"based on real life\\".  <br /> <br />There are many, many more examples of this in his book - where he \\"proves\\" that James Herriot was writing fiction - and he has no proof whatsoever.  Not even one single time.   <br /> <br />If there is one person writing fiction, that person is Mr. Lord.  Mr. Lord spends two entire chapters on a conjecture of how Alf's childhood might have been like - all based on the assumption that Alf had grown up in grinding poverty.  These chapters become almost a farce when we read his sons portrayal of his real childhood - although his parents were not rich they were certainly never poor, and Alfhad a very happy childhood.  He also explains the economics of why this was so.  Which puts Mr. Lord's two chapters of conjecture on how Alf's unhappy childhood might have been like in the category it deserves - pure fiction.  While the poverty of the under-class in Glasgow in the 1920's is certainly very sad, it definitely does not belong in a biography of Alf Wight. <br /> <br />Another mistake that Mr. Lord makes is that he constantly contradicts himself.  For example, in one chapter he spends many paragraphs conjecturing on why Alf was always poor, when he should have had a thriving practice - and the fanciful castles he builds in the air are very elaborate indeed.  And yet in another chapter he quotes a neighbor as saying - \\"oh, they claimed they didn't have any money but that wasn't true.  They had money for everthing - a tennis court, ballet lessons for Rosie, etc.\\"  This came across as a vitriolic statement, but of course in contradiction to his earlier assumption that he was poor.  Mr. Lord, you can't really have it both ways, can you? <br /> <br />Another example - he constantly quotes Eddie Steanton throughout the book, with all kinds of outrageous comments, yet he himself quotes one of Eddie's colleagues \\"oh, Eddie always exaggerates, you can't believe everything he says\\".  And later in the book it comes out that Eddie had had a falling out with Alf Wight, and I would assume that his \\"memories\\" might be somewhat tainted by those sentiments.  And yet Mr. Lord accepts Mr. Streaton as a fully credible source. <br /> <br />As matters stand now, this book is laughable and barely deserving of a review - except for one thing:  if Mr. Wight's son would not have written his own biography, Mr. Lord's fictious book would have remained as the factual biography of  Alf Wight.  He would have succeeded in besmirching Alf Wight's name with his book full of lies (oh, excuse me, fiction).  The fact that his son wrote his own biography, and a beautiful and moving one at that, has turned Mr. Lord's book into a joke, a book that his fans would not touch with a ten-foot pole, but Mr. Lord did not know that in advance.  He tried to change James Herriot's fans opinion of their idol, by trying to find \\"dirt\\" on him, and that was a very low thing.  The fact is that he fortunately did not succeed, but that does not take away from what Mr. Lord tried to do. <br /> <br />Mr. Lord, shame on you!	2004-11-16
US	34914255	R1VMGDEP47G3X8	0449006360	894257952	The Duke	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Mixed feelings	Gaelen Foley is the newest name in historical romance, and from the rave reviews on amazon.com I saw that this is one book that I would not want to miss.  \\"The Duke\\" was my first by Gaelen Foley, and although I enjoyed it, the book left me with many conflicting feelings.    On the positive side, Gaelen Foley is an excellent writer, and it is obvious that she has really done her research.  The book was extraordinarily well written, with an emotional yet elegant style that draws you fully into the story.  For those who said that there are grammatical errors and that the book was not well edited - I don't think so.  I think those errors were meant to be there.  Commas, periods, etc. are only meant to be there if it helps you say what you mean, and if by changing some of the rules of grammar you can make a stronger emotional impact, well, that's the writer's perogative.  The background and historical details were well done, too - Gaelen Foley managed to give us a very good idea of the social and economic issues of the time.    But the part that left me shaking my head was the dialogue and characterization.  The dialogue was so utterly modern, there wasn't even the slightest attempt to make these people even sound English, let alone Regency era.  After reading Judith McNaught, Georgette Heyer, Jane Austen - well, it grates on the nerves.  And the h/h - Hawk and Belinda - there are so many inconsistencies in their characters in only the first half of the book that I was tempted to close it right then and there.  Luckily for me, I did continue, because it certainly was an absorbing read, but the character inconsistencies never resolved themselves to my satisfaction.    Both Belinda and Hawk seem different people at different times.  First there is Belinda, virtuous orange seller, then there is Belinda the accomplished courtesan.  The transformation was so quick, it was almost hard to believe.  Then there is Belinda the mature, understanding, smart, and good-hearted girl -then there is the Belinda who acts almost like a child - which is it - is she mature, or not?    And the character of Hawk is ten times worse.  To be honest, if I were to place the Duke by his actions and words, I would think of a nineteen year old.  A very good, very eager to do the right thing, yet somewhat immature and naive nineteen year old.  And yet Hawk is supposed to be a Duke, the hero of this story?  There are so many times where Belinda seems to be mature and insightful, she is always smarter than him, always seems to understand people when he doesn't, that the Duke comes across as a bit of a bumbling idiot.  A really nice, sweet, GOOD bumbling idiot.       Hawk is supposed to be the paragon of virtue, the Duke who his so shiny that he is way above reproach.  Yet he suddenly acquires the most flashy and provocative of mistresses - and although we are told that he is not planning on consummating their union, this is still very much out of character.  In my experience, people who live their lives in this way are even MORE worried about what people will think than about actually doing *wrong* themselves, and this is exactly the kind of situation that perhaps can appeal to a romantic eighteen year old (everyone thinks that I am doing something wrong but meanwhile I'm above reproach), but I don't suppose the Duke is eighteen in this story.    There are just too many things he says or does that are at odds with his persona of the paragon Duke - someone who would zealously guard his reputation above all else - to make this story believable.  He falls for a married lady, and nurses the illusion of \\"pure love\\" - something a very young, or hopelessly naive man would do.  He hires a mistress - in a very public way - and he talks to her with tremendous courtesy and respect.  We have only Belinda's word that he looks down on her - I can't find a clue from the way he talks to her.  My understanding is that these *paragons of virtue*, even if they were to avail themselves of the services that \\"mistresses\\" offer, would still look upon this class of people with contempt - you only have to read a couple of Edith Layton's books to get an illustration.  The fact that this is hipocritical does nothing change their attitude.  And then when it comes to their big love scene - Hawk, a self propressed prude - seems to have an awful lot of knowledge of exactly what to do to Belinda to get her over her fears.  Hmm... this in an age where sex manuels were actually illegal to print, and from a man with very limited experience?  I don't think so.    Which brings me to the love scenes. . . although of course the best I've read, they seem to be superimposed on the story rather than flow from within the characters of the story.  These are two inexperienced people, they both haven't slept *around*, yet their encounters are perfect - no akwardness, no not sure of yourself - which is, come to think of it, so out of character for the Duke himself.  While these two people made a grand performance, that's just what it was - a performance for an audience.  Which does not make it less enjoyable, just unrealistic.      And there were so many parts of the book where I simply winced - I'll print just one example to show what I mean.     \\"How dare you force her into a marriage she doesn't want?\\" he roared at him.  Um, this is Regency England.  I don't even think there was a CONCEPT of getting the brides consent before the marriage, or if there was, it was confined to the lower classes.  A man would NEVER have made a statement like that in Regency England without turning into a laughingstock.  And besides, the bride never actually really objected!     So all in all, while \\"The Duke\\" was an excellent story, very emotional and very gripping, the innapropiate dialogue and inconsistent characterization kept me from enjoying this story to its fullest.  If these kind of things don't bother you, and you love a well-crafted, really emotional story - then Gaelen Foley isa must read for you.	2004-11-10

I have read some of Barbara Bretton's other books, and have enjoyed, but this book was a very different type of story, (not a romance), and it just didn't draw me in. <br /> <br />Everybody has their own background, their own slant as to what will touch their heart.  I saw that many people loved this book, but I guess our own experiences shape our interest, and although I loved other Barbara Bretton books, I should have checked out the synopsis before buying. <br /> <br />This is not a romance book, but rather a book that was more about mother/daughter relationships.  I always had an excellent relationship with my mother, and so this story did not \\"talk\\" to me.  I felt myself feeling that Rose was very much at fault, and I kept wanting to tell her off!  Since it's a little hard to \\"tell off\\" a character in a book, this book left me feeling rather frustrated.  Add that I didn't like the whole supranatural theme, and I found myself with very little to enjoy!  The only part of the book that I liked was the side story about his wonderful daughter, and I felt that that story really went nowhere. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a book about mother/daughter relationships, check the other reviews, and you will see that this book comes highly recommended.  But if you are looking for a romance, you might want to look further.	2004-11-09

If so, this book is it.  \\"The Day We Met\\" is a beautiful, glorious story of two people who fall head over heels in love at first sight, in the most improbable circumstances imaginable.  When I say improbable, I don't mean that it comes across as improbable, because Barbara Bretton makes it work. <br /> <br />As in very many romantic novel, their love is as real as real could be, but as always, there are road blocks to a permanent relationship.  And here Barbara Bretton cruises off charted territory to explore the complications of a \\"later in life\\" love story. There's her daughter (a major complication who thinks that her parents will still get together), there's his career (which just happens to be on the rocks just now), and there are all the special problems of step-families and second loves everywhere.  But all this wouldn't be that unsurmountable a problem, if it weren't for her past ghosts about step-fathers.  Her worries for her daughter keep that an obstacle that seems firmly in place - until the happy ending, where all our problems are resolved in one tidy sweep. <br /> <br />I loved this book - who wouldn't?  The love story is so perfect, the hero is so exactly right, that if anything, its almost too much.  And that's my only complaint.  She is content with the relationship the way it is, but it is him who wants more, and because of that he seems to have to prove his love to her constantly, over and over again, and not until he makes the ultimate sacrifice - risking his life - is she finally able to understand that this was meant to be.  I know that I'm the woman, and I should be enjoying this - but somehow I'm not.  How come HE has to prove his love?  She doesn't put her tiniest pinky out for him - like a previous reviewer mentioned, she doesn't come to the courtroom, to watch the most important court case of his life.  She doesn't bother finding out what had happened, why he's so upset.  Hey, I'm not complaining - like I said, I'm coming from the woman's point of view and it's always nice to see a hero put himself out over and over again for the heroine.  Oh, it makes sense, but still... <br /> <br />Definitely a very, very enjoyable story about the perfect love between two people who were very definitely meant for each other, and the obstacles they have to overcomeBut certainly very highly recommended, a perfect perfect story and one that I enjoyed very, very much.	2004-11-09

There is a lot to recommend this book: suspenseful story, exotic location (India), well researched and detailed info., flawed but likeable h/h, and especially, really, really great dialogue (Georgette Heyer comes to mind).  \\"Heart of the Tiger\\" was very easy to read, very easy to keep turning the pages.  The storyline was different enough to be intriguing, and the interaction between the h/h was simply very good and very funny.  <br /> <br />While I liked this author's style and would definitely buy another of her books, this particular book did not appeal to me too much.  I'm not a fan of the supranatural, and there is too much of that interwoven into the story (along with a lot of interweaving of Hindu religion) for me to have really enjoyed this book.   <br /> <br />Recommended, with reservations.	2004-11-02

A lot of regencies are simply contemporary people dressed up in costume.  This book is not. <br /> <br />This was my first book by Rexanne Becnel, and while I cannot give it five stars, I do think it deserves at least four stars and would like to explain why: <br /> <br />a. It is a very well written book. b. I always enjoy a book when the characters are true to their proposed time frame in history (e.g. when Regency people actually act like Regency people), and the characters in the story act appropiately.  Ms. Becnel has done her research and more, and it shows. <br /> <br />I can see, though, why this is not her best book.  The story does not completely pull me in, and the h/h are not the easiest to like.  (Although I do understand why the hero is so bent on revenge, and I like him a little better than the heroine, who I could not warm up to).  So although I cannot give this book five stars, I do think that this book does deserve at least four stars. <br /> <br />I can see that Ms. Becnel is a great writer, and I am looking forward to reading some of her more highly rated stories.	2004-11-02
US	34914255	R21MDUYDZHBIWO	0743437640	203941083	The Mulberry Tree	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Reading Jude Deveraux is like eating candy.	Unlike some previous reviewers, I did not \\"discover\\" Jude Deveraux until fairly recently, and it happens that I like her newer books somewhat better than her older titles.  Maybe it's my age, but grooms who rape their brides on their wedding nights and then fall asleep (as the first few JD novels' heros seem to do), or a hero who openly admits to not being \\"monogamous\\" -- these stories just don't do it for me.    I am not going to say that this was the best novel I have ever read, if I was really rating it I would say about four, four and half stars, but I can tell you this much:  from when I picked up this book, I had a hard time putting it down.  Sure, many parts of the book are improbable, and there is very little actual romance - as in dream hero kind of romance - but this IS a very funny and interesting book with lots and lots of plot turns - and I found I simply enjoyed it very much.    Perhaps it's the main character - Lillian/Bailey - I thought she was a really nice person and a welcome change from Darcy and some other \\"full-of-themselves/snipe,snipe,snipe\\" heroines from her other books.  Perhaps because I am a stay-at-home mom myself, I liked the way Bailey automatically took care of all the people in her life, and the way she is so not vindicative.  I just really liked Bailey, she is just a sweet person.  I also liked the way the story of her marriage to Jimmy developed, and as we get a deeper understanding of the dynamics behind their marriage, we understand why Bailey was acting the way she did.  I also enjoyed JD's portrayal of small town USA, and with a crack at husbands who manipulate their wives and wives who let themselves be manipulated, thrown in for good measure.  (JD, I got that part and I enjoyed it).    Sure, some parts of the book were a little over-the-top - like Matt's reaction to Bailey's cooking (if my husband were to see pickled grapes I'm afraid his reaction would be very different, grilled hamburgers is another story), Lillian loses weight a little TOO fast - (twenty, thirty pounds in just three weeks?  Wouldn't you wish), some of the car chases seem a little \\"movie\\" contrived, and the story of his lip - c'mon, they do surgery for kids in Africa \\"Operation Smile\\", but, really, this was a very good story, and worth reading even if there is not so much actual romance.    Look, Jude wrote how many books - forty? more?  and I'm amazed at how many plots she managed to come up with, that's pretty good, and I don't think it's fair for people to say she's gotten worse - it's just a different style, that's all.  How many authors can write the exact same story over and over and over, it would be so boring.    So this is my recommendation:  If you like a good, funny story with alot of twists and turns; if you like a story with all kinds of eccentric and sinister characters with a little mystery thrown in - this book is for you.  If you're looking for a hero that rapes his bride on his wedding night - re-read \\"The Velvet Promise\\".     P.S. Answer to Terry Benedict (spoilers follow):    a. Jimmy had taken care that even though Lillian would not get any money, his lawyer would take care of her, which actually did happen.  Perhaps he also did trust her too much, had too much faith in her ability, but luckily this is a story so it all works out in the end.    b. Jimmy was killed by his so-called siblings because of his money.  He suspected they were after him, which is why he set up the will the way he did.  If Lillian were to inherit, they would just kill her, too.  This way, if Lillian would find out   the truth, and bring it to the proper authorities, his so-called siblings would not benefit from the money, and Lillian WOULD actually get it in the end.     I agree with you, this is a little too contrived, why couldn't Jimmy just do this himself, or why couldn't he have left more hints for her (perhaps in a sealed envelope with his lawyer?). Maybe he figured that when the step-siblings get the money, they would not be suspicious of Lillian, and she could investigate further at her leisure, while he saw that he was running out of time?  I also think she could have explained this better in her book.  And why does Bailey renounce all that money?  It seems to me that JD, having too much money, has lost the respect the rest of us have for a few million dollars - no way would Bailey in real life give up that kind of money.	2004-10-31

I had loved it as my first romance book, but I had read many, many books since then, and I doubted that this book had really withstood the test of time.  Well, it did! <br /> <br />I read it again, and I loved it again.  Judith McNaught is an excellent writer, she writes beautifully with just the right amount of plot twists to keep you turning the pages, but what makes this book a keeper for me is the larger-than-life hero and heroine, their basic goodness and decency, and their love which grows by degrees, not just a \\"fall-in-lust\\" tale. <br /> <br />You will never find a better hero than Royce - both tough warrior and gentle lover - and Jenny, although I don't usually like very \\"spirited\\" heroines, I can understand where Jenny is coming from.  Another reviewer earlier mentioned that she didn't like the way Jenny kept being more loyal to her father than to Royce - but I think that it's a beautiful character trait of Jenny's.  She is loyal to her own, and even after her father treats her badly, she keeps making excuses for him, and taking his side against the enemy.  This is also a very good excuse for the back-and-forth that takes many, many pages to resolve - but to me, that is very realistic. <br /> <br />\\"Kingdom of Dreams\\" is considered a classic, and rightly so.  If you are trying Judith McNaught for the first time, please, please, please start with \\"Kingdom of Dreams\\".  And if you have read \\"Whitney, My Love\\" and didn't like it, please give Ms. McNaught another chance, and you will probably fall in love with her writing just like I did.	2004-10-31
US	34914255	R1FAS7MD5YMDIS	0380782332	489354413	Kiss an Angel	Books	5	6	10	N	N	The very best of romance	My copy of the book says on the cover \\"The very best that a book can be!\\", Jill Barnett, and I agree.  SEP is one of the best writers there is, period, and this book can easily become a classic.  It is both funny and sad, hopeful and heartbreaking, all at the same time.  One page you'll be laughing out loud, and then the next page you're heart will wrench, and the next page you'll be crying real tears.  SEP has the gift, and you feel that you are right there in the circus, experiencing everything right along with Daisy and Alex.    I put off reading this book for a long time, as the synopsis did not appeal to me.  A tough, Russian brooding guy married to a sweet, society girl?  A forced, arranged marriage where the bride and groom did not set eyes on each other before the marriage ceremony?  A story set in a circus?     But if anyone can make this unlikely scenario work, it's Susan Elizabeth Phillips.  I always love a story of impossible love, of two people who are totally wrong for each other ending up totally right for each other, and in this book this is done so very well that I think SEP spoiled me for almost any other romance book.    I hated Alex at first, but as the story goes on, he does redeem himself.  And I couldn't help falling in love with Daisy, she is just so very sweet and this story brings out her tremendous courage as she takes all that life has (unfairly) dealt her, and keeps on smiling and being sweet and kind throughout.  At the end of the book, she does run away, and although at first I was annoyed at her, as I thought it over I realized that was the smartest thing anyone can do.  Too many wives deal with abuse by excusing the abuser, letting the abuser salve his conscience by \\"making it up\\", and Daisy refused to allow him to do that.  I think it took a tremendous amount of emotional courage on Daisy's part to realize that, and to walk away even though it hurt her so badly.  Of course, this is fiction, and we are all brilliant in fiction, but actually it is SEP who is brilliant and who understands human nature so well.  Thank you, SEP!    Very definitely recommended for anybody, as this is simply a very good book, but especially recommended if you like books where the hero is transformed by *her* love.  Where the impossible happens.  I guess the circus was an appropriate setting after all, because this is a magical story.    I want to thank a previous reviewer for writing her thoughts about healing.  Yes, this is indeed a very healing book for anyone who has suffered any kind of trauma, definitely recommended!  This book may have been written simply, but this book does have so many brilliant insights that I think it can be read just for that alone.  And of course, for SEP's ability to transport you to another world with just a few paragraphs.  Thank you SEP!	2004-10-31

I was put off by the cartoonish cover, at first, but after a friend passed this book onto me, I couldn't resist taking a peak.   <br /> <br />Renee Esterhaus is on the run for a crime she didn't committ.  In the process she hooks up with exactly the kind of person she's trying to escape from - a policeman.  She does some wrong things in the first few chapters, it's true, but I can understand the degree of desperation that led her to it.  We feel her desperation as she realizes that the legal system is stacked against her - even if she didn't committ the crime, nobody will believe her, and she'll end up in jail - and she knows from experience that jail is NOT a place she wants to be in.   <br /> <br />Along the way we meet John, and the struggles that he grapples with as he has to choose between duty and love - or is it that simple? <br /> <br />Although there were some parts of this book that did make me cringe, I loved this book, anyway.  The book is well-written and fast-paced (with ALOT going on, you don't get bored), but mostly I loved this book because I love Jane Graves.  I love the way she portrays the love between these two unlikely people, I loved her vivid descriptions and the warm fuzzy feeling that stayed with me long after I closed this book. <br /> <br />If you want to read a book that is all about love, if you want a book that will create a warm feeling inside of you long after you close the last page, \\"I Got You Babe\\" is definitely a book to try.  Jane Graves has just made it to my auto-buy list.  Try it, she may make you list, too!	2004-10-31
US	34914255	R7HTXHBKOA4SS	0553280511	804782425	The Blue Castle	Books	5	16	16	N	N	A classic romance book.	L.M. Montgomery is well-known for the magic she spins in her childrens books, such as Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon.  She is less well known as an adult writer, but \\"Blue Castle\\" is very definitely an adult book, and the magic that is evident in her children's books is very much there in \\"Blue Castle\\" as well. <br /> <br />Valancy, the heroine of our story, wakes up on the morning of her 29th birthday, aware that she is still single and will be likely to remain so until the end of her days, being that she never had even one beau.  She has absolutely no-one who loves her, or even likes her, as her mother, who she lives with, barely tolerates her, and she doesn't like her mother too much either!  And her relatives are even worse!  She is ugly, her life is ugly, her bedroom is ugly, everything in her life is ugly and now, she wakes up to reality that her life will never change.  On the morning of her 29th birthday, she realizes that she has woken up to what is easily the worst day of her life. <br /> <br />Well, they say that you have to hit rock-bottom before things better, and for poor Valancy, things get even worse before it gets better, but of course, her life does change, in the magical way that L.M.Montgomery did best.   <br /> <br />If you are a romance reader, and have never read \\"Blue Castle\\" you are missing an experience.  Yes, Blue Castle has every cliche possible, but this book was written in the 1920's, long before they became cliches, and I marvel at how L.M.Montgomery has managed to include so many of the elements of a good romance novel.  We have the unpretty, old-maid heroine, the world against her, the local colorful characters, a real and truly rake - with an unhappy and tortured past, family and town disapproval, and of course, the happy ending - in this case a VERY happy ending.  Yet with all these elements, nothing is contrived - every part of this book makes psychological sense - and even the happy ending, which might be a little unbelievable in another writers pen, fits into the story like the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle. <br /> <br />My favorite line?  \\"I don't care how many dead wives you have in that room, dear, as long as they are really and truly dead.\\"  (Valancy is talking about a room that her husband keeps locked and she may not enter). <br /> <br />Some books written seventy years ago feel dated when read by today's standards, yet \\"Blue Castle\\" feels surprisingly contemporary.  It has simply withstood the test of time very well, and anybody today can identify with, and enjoy, Valancy's beautiful love story. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have written that this book has simply changed their lives, and I can believe it.  This is the kind of book that has the magic to touch you in a way that no other book can. <br /> <br />If you are a romance reader and you are looking for a book that is quite simply, the most beautiful romance book ever, you owe it to yourself to try \\"The Blue Castle\\".  Very, very definitely not a children's book, but still magic - a magical books for adults.	2004-10-31

I have read many marriage counseling kind of books, and I am going to say that this is the best one that I have read so far.  Rebbetzin Jungreis is known for her timeless wisdom, her way with words, her way of talking straight to the heart, and in this book we see all those qualities in abundance. <br /> <br />\\"The Committed Marriage\\" is beautifully written, with much sound advice based on real-life experience.  It is both inspiring and practical, in the sense that while she writes about the beauty of a Jewish marriage and how to maintain happiness and love throughout your life, she also brings many practical real life examples. <br /> <br />Everyone has their favorite parts to this book, mine are the parts where she discusses what \\"Rayim Ahuvim\\" - beloved friends - really mean, and the story with her daughter and the tickets.  I was also very impressed with the many beautiful stories of her late husband, zt'l.  <br /> <br />If you must read only one book on marriage - make this your book.

I didn't mind the slow part, and I did think it was necessary to explain how the circumstances of their marriage was the way it was. <br /> <br />But . . .  <br /> <br />First, I had really come to like Michael from the first two books in the series.  He comes across as a steady, reliable person, with a lot of depth.  In short, I had really come to like him.  I did not recognize Michael at all in this book.  He acts totally out of character for how I had expected the other Michael to act.  Also, I felt that Michael deserved better than second-hand love, a love that was given to him \\"because he was always there\\", that \\"she could come to like him also\\".  I really think Michael deserved better than that, he deserved to have his wife love him for all his real qualities.  Instead, Michael comes across as Rachel's second choice - we never actually see her totally renouncing her first love.  (And she could easily have done so - who hasn't had a first, yet long ago love?) <br /> <br />Second, Rachel does not get developed at all this book.  We get to see that she's beautiful - and that men desire her - but that's it.  I know she's quiet - but even quiet people can have SOME personality. <br /> <br />Third, even though I usually like mysteries as a subplot, and the mystery was quite good, having read all Agatha Christie's books, it was all to obvious who the culprit was.  (There, I gave you a really big hint). <br /> <br />Candace Camp, as always, writes beautifully, and it is always a pleasure to read a novel of hers, even if I didn't like the characters.   <br /> <br />In her defense, I would have to say that she had set the book up to be a very hard one to do - a marriage that was a sham for ten years to suddenly turn into a real one is a very difficult concept to pull off well - but I guess I was expecting some kind of flash of brilliance, which this book definitely did not have.   <br /> <br />Oh, and the name Lillith, by the way, is a very funny one to use for such a nice lady.  I'm sure she didn't know that the original Lillith was the demon of sexual temptation in Jewish lore!  The person who should have been named Lillith was actually Lady Vesey!  <br /> <br />I wish Ms. Camp would re-write this book!	2004-10-18

Luckily for me, Jane Heller did it all herself.   <br /> <br />This book for me was an all-nighter.  I simply couldn't put it down.  Look, humor is relative.  People have different life experiences, therefore people find different things funny.  Now, I know many people who have read \\"Mars and Venus\\" books and feel that they were really, really helpful to them in their relationships. I have read alot of these books, and while there are many good points, I feel that alot of it is formula - and, so, if my husband says \\"How was YOUR day\\" instead of \\"How was your day! Goodbye\\"  I'm suddenly going to be happy?  He didn't mean it then, and he still doesn't mean it now.  So what does it help if he learned to be a parrot?  So you can see why I found \\"Female Intelligence\\" so hilarious.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the h/h as well.  They were a really funny couple - you know, the kind where they're so opposite that everything about them is funny? <br /> <br />And, no, I didn't \\"know\\" who gave away Lynn's secrets to the media.  I am thankful that I have good friends, it never occured to me that a good friend could really do that. <br /> <br />For those who took this book seriously - it was a spoof!  A spoof with a message, if you will.  I think it did have a message somewhere in all that laughter.  I especially loved the part where he analyzes what went wrong with her parent's marriage - and he's right!  That part was really funny. <br /> <br />And I don't think she could have possibly have meant it seriously (the author), when she had Lynn (the character) saying \\"Oh, I don't know how you metabolize mousse, but that mousse last night went straight to my thighs!\\"  Can you imagine a man actually saying that?  I don't think Jane Heller was really that stupid that she thought a therapist would actually say that, she justthought of some outrageous things a therapist MIGHT say, and then doubled and quadrupled it, till we have a very funny method, and a funny book.  This was NOT a how-to book on the Wymann method, it was a comedy!  The Wymann method was NOT meant to be taken seriously!  I don't think everyone got that. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book, and it was a pleasure to read the dialogue where you have two very intelligent people having a conversation, rather than what is the case in some other books where the characters either talk AT each other, or both crack a bunch of one-liners.  To be quite honest, I found all that intelligent conversation a little intimidating - I don't have those kind of conversations, it's easy to see that Jane Heller's IQ is quite a few points above mine.  But while mine is not quite there alas, it's fun to watch a real first class brain at work.	2004-10-12

While this book had some positive elements, this book did not add up to a four star book for me, and I'll explain why.    \\"My Lady Housekeeper\\" starts off well - excellent writing, an interesting and promising storyline, and strong, easy-to-picture characters.  However, after the first few chapters, the writing and storyline went downhill -- something which does sometimes happen in Regencies, but this does annoy me.  The first few chapters were well-developed, easy to read, but as I read on, I found myself getting more and more confused, and less and less interested in sorting out my confusion.    The romantic interest is built up on and resolved quite early in the book.  At that point, Ms. Savery changes the topic, and suddenly brings in a large cast of characters, and turns around to tackle the question which had been put on the back burner until now - why is our hero now an Earl?  What has happened to his five predecessors?  At that point, the book lost my interest.  The writing turned sloppy, the plot turned thin, and the many characters that were introduced, along with a brand-new storyline, (AND with the h/h taking a complete back burner) left me with a very disappointed feeling.  The added plot threads at this point, which were unrelated to the story, detracted from the story, rather than added to it, IMHO.    Some parts of the story seemed implausable to me as well.  The reason why the heroine won't get married?  It seems an extremely weak reason to me.  So tell me that the heroine is a strong willed person, she has lived all her life with her father, and this is the first issue they ever have a disagreement about?  And a disagreement that has such far-reaching repurcussions?  It simply could have been done alot better.    And there is another hole as well - where the villian confides in someone else and gets him to help him.  I simply can't imagine that anyone could be that stupid, let alone someone who has managed to do four murders in four months without attracting suspicion.    I know that everyone has their preferences in a story, and I do see where the previous reviewer is saying that the heroines are such likeable people - I do like them, and I think that this book could have been a very good one indeed, if that part of the book were allowed to take up a more central role in the plot, and if the author would have taken as many pains with the last ten chapters as she did with the first few.    This is one of my first Regencies, and perhaps I am simply expecting too much of Regencies?  If I am, and other Regencies are similar to this one, this genre has one less fan.	2004-10-12
US	34914255	R3244C8Y9KIP6Q	155166884X	973081392	Doing Good	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Easily the most thought-provoking book I've read this year.	The book starts off with Jane Lafton, a woman who is \\"doing good\\" as in quite alright, thank you, who got into a car accident.  She is saved with barely a scratch, but her scare got her thinking about her life, and how she wants to change it.  With this resolution the heavy gears of change are set into motion, first slowly, then, as gears are wont to do, the changes in her life become much more profound. <br /> <br />This was not the most well-written book I have ever read, there were not a huge amount of fancy prose or spell-binding cliff-hangers, nor was this a romance in the true sense of the word.  However, this was definitely a book that challenges you to take a good look at your life, and, even if you think you're \\"doing pretty good\\", as Jane Lafton thought of herself, there's always room for a small shift in priorities.  I can honestly say that Pamela Morsi made me take a hard look at my own life, not to say I was exactly like that, but thinking through life, and growing, is what life is all about.  This book had a tremendous amount of insights that I've never come across before in a book, romance or otherwise, and you can tell that Ms. Morsi really thought through her subject matter very deeply before writing this novel.  I've read some other books with similar themes, with the protagonist going through a near-death experience and changing her life, but usually it transforms into a divorce, a career change, etc.  Although Jane does go through those things, it is portrayed very differently, as a natural progression of her personal growth rather than a desire to actually change her life.  Ms. Morsi also changed my views on divorce - until now I never thought there was such a thing as a GOOD divorce, I always thought that a divorce should be fought no matter what, but this book changed my mind.  I am actually quite an opinionated person, and a pretty critical one, too - it takes a good deal to impress me.  \\"Doing Good\\" impressed me very much. <br /> <br />If you're looking to change your life - even a little bit - you simply can't get a better how-to manual than \\"Doing Good\\".  Thank you, Pamela Morsi.	2004-10-10

If you have skipped Georgette Heyer because you find her hard reading, I beg you to read \\"Convenient Marriage\\".  This is a fun book in every sense of the word; a romp in Regency era (I'm sorry, I stand corrected, it's Georgian).  There is not alot of major plot twists or deep character analysis, but plenty of just plain fun that is really very, very funny.     There is the signature Heyer's extreme meticulousness of detail, down to the exact fashion of the year, and there is also her signature dialogue, and humor.  But what I loved most of all was the love story between Hory and Lord Rule.  It is hard to do seventeen and thirty-two - there is such a disparacy of age, seventeen is really SO young - and most authors who do have this age gap in their protaganists usually simply gloss over it.  In the \\"Convenient Marriage\\", the age gap is one of the underlying problems which keep husband and wife apart - in a \\"Convenient Marriage\\", and it is with great skill, tact and humor that Ms. Heyer brings them together, at last.  Everything is done exactly right - Hory (Horatia) acts within character, Lord Rule acts within character - at least the way I think it is realistic, I have never actually seen that kind of marriage up close.      Some reviewers didn't like Horry - give it a break!  She's only seventeen!  And very spirited for seventeen, too.    But the highlight of the book for me was definitely Lord Rule.  He did and said everything just so perfectly, he treats Horry - who is leading him for a merry dance, but is also young enough to be his daughter - exactly the way a hero should!  He deals with her gently, but deal with her he does.  Although it may seem at times that Horry is coming across the winner in their battle of wits, Lord Rule is always a few steps ahead of her, but, oh, so gently, so cleverly, does he outsmart her!  I could not have imagined their interactions any better, at all.  Simply, simply perfect.      For all those who complain about all those alphamales in other novels - here is your hero!  He is about as un-alpha-male as you can get, yet he does not sacrifice his masculinity in the least!  Just for the character of Lord Rule alone it is worth rating this book ten stars!    If you are a romance reader, and have not yet read Georgette Heyer, read this book, you will NOT regret it!	2004-10-10

I had to step on the bandwagon of fans for \\"Truly Madly Yours\\", and even though it was said so many times before, I had to say it again!  This is a GREAT book! <br /> <br />But although I enjoyed this book very much, I have to first say that there are quite a few holes in the plot. (Spoilers follow) First, Delaney is angry at Nick for what happened ten years ago between the two of them.  I can see that she was upset at the time, but surely as she matured she must have put two and two together and realized that he was not taking advantage of her?  She's not that stupid, is she?   <br /> <br />Second, um, did anyone pick this up - Her step-father could not father any children, because he had a zero sperm count, and yet, he managed to produce a bastard son from a one-night stand?  I kept waiting to see some explanation (he got Mumps afterwards or something), but no, no explanation.   <br /> <br />Third, this is not a plot hole, but I would have really liked to see an epilogue, where Ms. Gibson would wrap everything up for us - the money, the place where they would live, the parent's reactions, what happened between Delaney's mother and her boyfriend?  I guess Ms. Gibson stopped in the right strategic place to leave us hanging - and wondering; and for the more imaginative ones among us - to concoct all the satisfactory scenes in our own heads.  The ending certainly makes us think - but I DONT LIKE IT! <br /> <br />All in all, despite all the problems above, this was still a five star book.  Why?  This is a book that grabs you and pulls you in.  Once I got past the first few pages, I simply couldn't put it down.  This is a book about all of us, about real people, and it's funny in a way that will touch your soul.  The ending is a \\"truly\\" happy ending, with just the right amount of everything to make it so.  And the h/h are just right, too.  Nick is not perfect, just the better side of normal, in my opinion.  He doesn't do and say perfect things, and I like him alot better that way.  Neither, for that matter, does Delaney.  But we love her just the way she is! <br /> <br />Those reviewers who said this book was not about love did NOT read this book.  Yes, he keeps saying it's not love, it's lust, but we the readers, know better.  It's all the things he does, not what he he says, that make us, the readers, understand differently.  And, yes, she keeps saying, \\"I hate him\\", but then she can't keep away from him, she can't tell him no.  If she were some spineless girl who can't say no to anybody, the attraction would not be as believable, but we see her sticking up for herself all over the place, and if she simply wants someone, anybody, why does she say \\"no\\" to Steve? <br /> <br />And no, they do NOT spend the entire novel being nasty to each other.  They are actually quite good to each other, except when they get into a fight (over quite understandable reasons).  It's everyone around them who are nasty to THEM, to Nick and Delaney.  I think everyone is actually quite horrid, and I think there are so many strikes against them that its a miracle they actually got together in the face of so much real opposition.  And I've read alot of books were the h/h fall in lust with each other, but this is not one of them.  Ms. Gibson is just very good at describing those scenes. <br /> <br />Yes, a major plot flaw, and the pieces are not tied up well enough for my liking, but still - a five plus star book!  It's worth it!	2004-09-23

Ms. Sayers herself considered Murder Must Advertise as a lightweight book, written on the side while taking a break from some of her more complex novels.  Three quarters of a century later, it seems that what she considered her most brilliant work and what actually stood the test of time are two different things.  I have never been able to get through \\"Nine Tailors\\", I found it excrutiatingly boring, and although I finished \\"The Five Red Herrings\\", I am sad to say that quite a bit of the intricate plot went over my head.  I am not complimenting myself by saying so, since both these books were, I am sure, brilliant.  Perhaps I can blame it on the generation gap? (I wish).<br /><br />But \\"Murder Must Advertise\\" is still as funny  and as relevant today as it was when it was first published.  Ms. Sayers drew on her own experience working in an ad agency, and it shows.  (Writing copy was what she did for a living, writing novels was simply not as lucrative in those times as it is today). The characters that populate the ad agency are so real, you can almost feel that they will get up out of the book and walk around.  I also loved the character developement of Lord Peter, because to develope from his previous books he sure did do.  In \\"Murder Must Advertise\\", he shows us a different side to himself than is apparent in the first few books, and I think Dorothy Sayers saw him differently as well.  What's interesting in the Lord Peter Whimsey books is that Lord Peter comes across differently in each novel, there is real and true character development.  Unlike almost any other series novelists I can think of, where if you pick up the first book and you pick up the last book you will find the same person; if you will pick up \\"Who's Body\\" and \\"Busman's Honeymoon\\" you will actually meet two different people.  (Lord Peter becomes even more developed in \\"Gaudy Night\\" and \\"Busman's Honeymoon\\").<br /><br />\\"Murder Must Advertise\\" is well-crafted and funny, with a blend of humor and melodrama that complement each other extremely well, in my opinion.  Even the ending, which many reviewers have stated was too dark, I found it be just right - this is a murder mystery after all, and murderers must get punished.  Although the story is light-hearted and funny, every now and then we see a grim side to Lord Peter as he keeps reminding himself, and the reader, why he is really there - and its not for fun.  There is an undercurrent of seriousness throughout the book, which finally breaks through in the \\"dark\\" ending.  But make no mistake, the ending does not come out of nowhere, if you read the book carefully, you will see that it was there all along.<br /><br />Was this Dorothy Sayers best?  She herself said not, and its hard to argue with an author, especially a dead one.  Did I enjoy this book the most?  Yes I did, with \\"Busman's Honeymoon coming in a very close second (another semi-comedy).  As far as relevance to today's mindset, I think this book has stood the test of time very well.<br /><br />I don't think this should be your first Lord Peter book, however.  I think you have to read a \\"stuffy\\" Lord Peter book first, to better appreciate this novel.	2004-09-23
US	34914255	RJQ1VCB2UL2NT	0425153290	361599052	Truly	Books	5	11	11	N	N	One of Mary Balogh's best	\\"Truly\\" is not the type of book to be gulped in one sitting, its a book that you have to read slowly, to savor the setting, the people, and the country.  Wales, which I am reading here is Mary Balogh's native country, truly comes alive in \\"Truly\\".  And better yet, I like all the people that I meet, and that's saying alot, because I usually don't like all the people in a romance novel - sometimes they're mean, silly, stupid, etc.  But in \\"Truly\\" Mary Balogh shows us the \\"inside\\" of the Wale people of the last century, and, as in any country, there are good people and bad, but mostly you admire them for their grit, for their simple yet graceful way of life, and for their commitment to their land and to each other. <br /> <br />The hero and heroine of \\"Truly\\" are probably the first h/h I have met that really fit the image presented by the words hero and heroine.  We get to meet Marged and Geraint at their best, although the story narrates the part where they both make mistakes, when this books begins they are both mature and grown up, and therefore their romance has more depth than if they were two silly, immature youngsters.  Not only are they grown-up, but by flashbacks, we get to see how they both got to that point.  I particularly loved the character of Marged, to me she seemed the perfect embodiment of a true heroine, she's truly outspoken and brave, but not as foolishly so as some other \\"heroines\\" are wont to be.  In other words, while she acts with spirit and courage, she does it not because she wants to make a dramatic statement, or to act more like a man, or out of spite; she's not really full of hate, but rather, in everything she does she acts with courage, fire, spirit - and also with forethought.  A real heroine! <br /> <br />\\"Truly\\" also has more of a plot, with real twists and turns, than some other Baloghs.  Against the historical backdrop of the Rebecca Riots, complete with the masked \\"Rebecca\\", there is alot of tension as we wait to see what will happen with the riots?  And will \\"Rebecca\\" be unmasked?  How will everyone react?  Definitely a page turner. <br /> <br />I even loved the ending.  It seemed to me to be exactly how a romance should end.  Although Geraint is a little on the stiff side, it does fit in very well with his character - I wouldn't change a word if I could.  Of course, there is always that question - what happens afterwards?  How does everyone adjust to their new roles?  Ah, but for that we have our own imaginations!  All in all, if you like Mary Balogh, you will love \\"Truly\\"!	2004-09-20

Although I loved and still love all the Anne books - I discovered them as a teen-ager and am still re-reading them every now and then - I especially love to re-read Anne's House of Dreams.    There are so many elements to make a good story!  There is the romantic aspect of Anne and Gilbert setting up house together, then there are some of my very favorite characters - Captain Jim and Miss Cornelia.  They certainly don't make them that way anymore!  Between the four of them (five including Leslie) there are so many thought provoking discussions, and we get a fascinating view of life \\"on the harbor\\" for those times.    But what really sends this book way over the five star category is definitely Miss Cornelia!  This is a character that not only is living and breathing throughout the book, you wish she would pop up in your living room!  Wouldn't I love to meet her!  If you like strong, independent women, and you thought that they were only a character of fiction (surely a hundred years ago women were meek and timid?), well, this book was written quite some time ago, and Miss Cornelia could almost put Gloria Steinhem to shame!  Miss Cornelia is the strong, independant woman that you thought did not exist in those days - she owns her own house and fields, she manages very, very well, thank you very much, will not get married because she doesn't want a man telling her what to do, and certainly does not need a man to help her self-esteem!  She also thinks that men were only put on this earth to enslave women, and the world would be much better off without them \\"believe me!\\") I love her favorite phrase \\"isn't that just like a man\\", it became part of my mental thinking process.    Certainly better than anything written today!	2004-09-15
US	34914255	R2XR8LM312CLN1	0373290837	576911778	Lady Sarah's Son (Harlequin Historicals #483)	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Okay book, with well-fleshed characters.	I started buying Gayle Wilson on the recommendation of Amazon reviewers.  I like her depth, her understanding of human nature . . . but is this a five star book?  I think not.  There is not much in the way of plot development - one single premise, a secret of Lady Sarah's . . . and since we are already privvy to the secret in the beginning of the book - not much to read for, is there?   <br /> <br />As for the writing - I've seen it said that this book is exceptionally well written.  Well, maybe compared to other Harlequins - I don't know.  But, has anyone actually read this?  I mean, sentence by sentence, word by word?  Gayle Wilson has a lot to say, with a lot of depth, and she uses alot of big words, long sentences to say it.  But after the tenth time where I found myself trying to re-arrange the sentence to make the writing flow more smoothly and to make her meaning clearer, I just gave up.  I think this book needed some more editing.  I found it very hard going when I'm constantly trying to figure out - what exactly is she trying to say, and why doesn't she say it more clearly?  Or how would I say this to make the sentence flow more smoothly? This sort of ruined the experience for me.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad book by any means, and there are many, many good parts - but not much plot, convulated writing. . . that sort of makes it hard to give it five stars. <br /> <br />Someone mentioned earlier that they didn't understand why Lady Sarah kept her secret, and that the marriage of convenience was not believable.  Did she actually read the book?  Firstly, Lady Sarah swore on her mother's grave that she would never tell anyone.  Maybe today that doesn't mean anything, but let me assure you, in those days it meant quite a bit.  And the marriage of convenience - the book explains - in detail - why they both agreed to it.  The book actually explains both issues in major detail - in many, many pages. <br /> <br />In short, a good book, complex characters,parts of it are well-written - but by no means five stars.	2004-09-12
US	34914255	R2C99JR0XMU4WG	0373292074	250304136	Her Dearest Sin	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Romance mixed with suspense - great combination!	I actually think this book rated four stars, but I'm giving it an extra star to help with the ratings. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the h/h - Sin and Pelar - certainly not a typical pair!  This book is better written than another Wilson that I have just read, I loved the plot, and the dialogue, the comaradie - it all sparkles! <br /> <br />Sin is set out to get even with the woman(girl) who did him wrong - but when he discovers that things are not the way they appeared to be, he about faces in his objective.  He actually changes course a few times over the story, as he becomes aware of more and more of the facts.  In this story the heroine is rescued from a terrible situation - and I always love stories where that happens - and good triumphs (barely) over evil. <br /> <br />That said, I did have some gripes with the story.  While there are many parts of the book that are exceptionally well-written, there are also many parts that are not exceptionaly so.  The well-written bits are exceptionally well-written, however, and almost makes it worthwhile plodding through the rest!  And the story itself - while the plot is good, and the characters are likeable and come very much alive in this book - I think that Ms. Wilson could have done a better job in drawing us in to the emotions of all the people involved. <br /> <br />I have seen another review earlier of one of Ms. Wilson's books, with the reviewer saying that although her books are well-written, there is something missing.  I feel the same way.  I think part of that something is that, for the most part, she is writing the story from the outside - in a cool, detached manner, in place of a dramatic, emotional manner when we reach dramatic, emotional parts of the story (which there were quite a few of, by the way).  We don't get much of an emotional understanding of the h/h, for one thing - as a previous reviewer pointed out - where is the point where we see why and how they fall in love?  Okay, ifyou think about it, you can figure it out, but we would rather the author did the thinking - and the emotional feelings of h/h - for us. <br /> <br />But, I did enjoy \\"Her Dearest Sin\\".  There were many parts of the book where the writing was excellent, and I found the H/H, plus surrounding characters, completely believable and sympathetic.  If you like complex, easy-to-like characters, a suspenseful plot with above-average writing - this book is worth reading.	2004-09-12
US	34914255	R1DI7M81ZOEQGD	0373835582	75163074	The Black Moth	Books	5	47	53	N	N	Georgette Heyer - an unexpected treasure!	\\"The Black Moth\\" is my first Georgette Heyer.  Coincidentally, it seems, from reading other reviews, that this was the first book she wrote.  When I first opened it, I was actually surprised - and a little disappointed.  From reading reviews on-line, I had expected paragraphs upon paragraphs of elegant prose, complex characterizations, unusual characters - what I actually saw was pages upon pages of dialogue.  Disappointed, I put this at the bottom of my TBR pile.  Then, by chance, I read these reviews, and discovered that Georgette Heyer had written this book at only 17.  (Was it 17?)  Well, seventeen!  That's a different story! With that in mind, I decided to try again.  And quickly amended my original assessment of a flat and boring book. For a 17 year old girl, this was a work of pure genius. <br /> <br />I have not read any other Heyer books, as yet.  But I truly loved \\"The Black Moth\\".  I loved the characters.  I loved the dialogue.  I even loved the plot - yes, it is so predictable, yet almost magical in the way that this is the real romance plot, no surprises, no hidden twists, and yet the reader is kept entranced by the sheer enjoyment of the reading experience. <br />(To be fair to the author, the plot was probably a little more original when she initially penned it.) <br /> <br />But, with hindsight being 20/20, I can see that a teen-ager - albeit a very gifted teen-ager - wrote this book.  There is just a bit too much of the fantastic - too many coincidences, too much drama just for the sake of drama (what earthly reason does John/Jack have for acting as a highwayman?  The storyline gives an explanation, but it is a lame excuse in my opinion. For an intelligent man to flirt with such extreme danger to himself - either from passengers unexpectedly armed, or the hangman's noose - not good enough.  But good enough if you are 17.)   <br /> <br />Some reviewers have mentioned that the characters are somewhat one - or two - dimensional as compared to her laterbooks.  Not having read any other books, I cannot judge, but to compare to other, more contemporary books - they are really not too bad.  Maybe not very complex, but realistic they are.  How I loved Lady Lavinia! A carricature of the English high-born lady, not of the time this novel was set, as a previous reviewer pointed out, but of the times in which Ms. Heyer herself lived.  Besides, isn't there a little of Lady Lavinia in all of us?  And the other characters - Jack, Dick, Jim - there is certainly nothing one-dimensional about them.  Besides being very entertaining.  For a 17 year old girl, in fact, it is sheer brilliance.  And last, but not least, the Duke!  Here we have someone quite complex, and to be honest, more realistic a portrayal of the true \\"rake\\" than some more modern novels have us believe a rake to be.  And the friendship of the Duke with \\"Frank\\" of the opening letter I find simply astonishing.  It's hard to imagine a conversation such as they had taking place in modern times - all the more reason to believe that this story took place a very, very long time ago.  \\"The past is a different country, they do things differently there.\\" <br /> <br />If perhaps her characters were not quite fully complex, and the plot a bit too fantastic, her style of writing is superb.  Again, I haven't read any of her later books, but I cannot believe that in style of writing she changed too dramatically.  There is something very finished about the writing in \\"The Black Moth\\".   <br /> <br />I had been hesitant to try Georgette Heyer, pushing it off for a long time.  Many previous reviewers wrote that she is a brilliant writer, with an extremely careful eye for period detail.  I have nothing against \\"great\\" writers, but I have found that they are not generally light reading, so I pushed off Heyer until I would have \\"time\\".  How surprised I was to find that this book is actually not \\"heavy\\" reading at all!  Ms Heyer had a rare gift for words - an elegance of prose that is both terse and clear, with a story-line that flows smoothly and entertainingly - it is very easy to \\"get-into\\" her work.  And the dialogue!  It is worth reading a Heyer just for the dialogue alone.  This simplicity of style is, in my opinion, the hallmark of a great writer.  Some writers get the reputation of being \\"great\\" writers - rightly or wrongly deserved - by using many long words and putting them all together in sentence after sentence.  Some of these, are indeed, good writers, (such as Mary Balogh, Mary Jo Putney), but some of them, in my opinion, are simply great wordsmiths - not necessarily great writers - there IS a difference.  It is indeed a talent to be able to use many long words and put them together sentence after sentence, but it is, in my opinion, a greater talent to use simple words, simple sentence structure, and be able to express oneself beautifully and clearly.  To express oneself in a way that is both easily understood, and compelling, to write your story concisely yet at length, this is how Georgette Heyer wrote.  It is easy to see how she became a classic!	2004-09-07
US	34914255	R29U2ARMFDFEY9	0671737791	378094364	The Bride	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A good book, but not great.	This was my first book by Julie Garwood. <br /> <br />I can see why it is so highly rated by other readers, I would have loved it too if it were one of my first romance books. \\"The Bride\\" has all the elements of a good romance book.  You get to love the h/h, the story is well written, it's simple, it's nice - and there is a plot - just enough of a plot - to keep you going to the end.  But unfortunately, since I read some other books with similar plots first, both done better and written better - such as Judith McNaught, Jude Deveraux - \\"The Bride\\" doesn't hold up.  Don't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with the \\"The Bride\\" - just that there are other books done better. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a nice, sweet romance, this is the book for you.  But if you are a heavy romance reader and are looking for something a little different, this is not it.	2004-08-29

Unfortunately, Seth seems a little . . . shall we say less than enthusiastic to the idea?   <br /> <br />This a really good story.  It starts off with a bang - funny, interesting, lots of authentic, historical detail - which is always a plus for me.  The characters are funny, the story is fast-paced and heartwarming.   <br /> <br />I did not enjoy it, however, and I'll explain why.  This story deals - at length - with two people who have long term chronic, and potentially fatal illnesses.  Having just lost two close family members after a very long and painful illness, I found this book simply too sad, it brought up so many bad memories, and I found those parts of the book painful to read.   <br /> <br />So, this is my synopsis -  this is a fun, fast-paced book, with a heartwarming ending - however, if this kind of story (long term chronic illness) will bring up bad memories for you, you may want to skip it.	2004-08-29

Devin has to marry a rich heiress to stay out of debtor's prison.  His only option seems to be Miranda, whose father is very eager to see the match for reasons of his own.  Devin refuses to marry Miranda.  Miranda refuses to marry Devin.  That should settle the matter . . . or does it?<br />There are so many things I loved about &quot;So Wild a Heart&quot;. I loved both Miranda and Devin, the h/h in this book.  Seldom have I fallen so hard for both h/h, and seldom have I seen a more well-matched pair. First, of course, there is Miranda.  Unlike other novels, where the heroine is considered &quot;spunky&quot; if she talks nastily and snipes at everyone - not to mention things being thrown here and there - in this book Miranda is simply goal-oriented - she knows what she wants, and she plans how to get it - all while being quite nice and polite, if a bit plain-spoken.  Miranda is my heroine through and through.  I also like that her personality is not contrived - Ms. Camp does not simply take a modern woman and transplant her in olde England - rather, there is a realistic explanation for Miranda's personality.  First, she is an American - and she does indeed talk in the English perception of Americans of the time - plus, since she was always wealthy, and her father's right-hand man (or is it woman?) in business, she WOULD be somewhat more plain spoken and confident than the average English miss.<br />Second, there is Devin.  Although the opening scenes with Devin start off rather rotten, actually, and I almost hated him, the books goes steadily upwards from there, making Devin a more and more likeable hero the further we read.  Devin is actually a very credible &quot;rake&quot; who is really &quot;good&quot; underneath - Candace Camp describes Devin in a way that reminds me of many men like him that I know - men (rather boys) who are simply lost and unhappy, but decent, really, underneath.  And Devin is VERY decent underneath.  By the end of the book, I actually feltthat Devin was really too good to be true!<br />Third, there is the plot.  There are so many twists and turns that this is a book that is hard to put down.  I have to admit, there are parts to the plot that do suspend credibility - but this is a made-up story after all, it's all alot of fun, and besides - look, it COULD have happened!  And it sure was interesting reading!  This book is a lot of fun in other ways too - the dialogue is snappy and witty, there are some really funny scenes (as in hold-your-breath-then-laugh) and the characters are VERY likeable and well drawn. It is so refreshing to see such mature, likeable characters, so different from almost all other romance novels I have read. <br />And then there is Leona.  The bad, evil woman.  This is such an old fashioned concept - the concept of the bad woman leading the guy astray - and a very rare concept in today's novels.  (This reminds me of Jezebel and Ahab of the Bible - perhaps the original source for this concept). In this case, this being a romance novel, it is goodness that ultimately triumphs.  Old fashioned - yet, an unusual story-line.<br />One small problem, however, which would make me give this book four and a half stars if I could - this book is not as well written as I would like.  I suspect that the cause is sloppy editing, yet it grated slightly.  I am definitely not the world's leading expert on grammar - so if I feel that the sentence would have been better off a little differently . . . but I am sure that this was an editing mistake.<br />Second problem I have . . . I simply cannot believe that a girl like Miranda would be so aware of the concepts of married love.  I don't want to give away the storyline - but somewhere in middle of the novel, she says to herself - I don't want to get involved physically because then I will be more involved emotionally.  And in general, her whole plan . . . it's hard to imagine a virgin in that day and age - where these concepts were not discussed publicly - would have such an awareness of herself, and of the married state, in general.  So that part of the novel is not totally realistic.  However, it does make a really good story, and it especially makes Miranda into a WONDERFUL heroine!  Isn't Miranda the woman we all secretly wish we were?  So, even though, even though . . . I LOVED it!<br />I loved this book!  I have to thank Amazon reviewers for pointing this book out to me, and I am sure to buy more of Candace Camp in the future!	2004-07-11

I tried Diana Palmer based on the ratings from Amazon.  I can't believe that I could disagree so radically with so many other people.    Let's see, where should I start?    First, there are some misconceptions I would like to clear up.  In this book, there is a reference to placenta previa during pregnancy.  This author has simply not done her homework!  Having had placenta previa during one of my pregnancies, and having done alot of research on the topic, I can tell you that everything about the way she describes it is wrong.  The symptoms are wrong, the treatment is incorrect, even the basis is wrong!  Placenta previa is actually VERY common in early pregnancy, I think it is even like one out of three; and ninety percent of the time it corrects on its own as the pregnancy advances.  It is also not really dangerous until much later on in the pregnancy.  With the symptoms as described in the book, it seems more like a threatened miscarriage.  It is possible that Diana Palmer writes the situation the way it used to be understood, before the advent of sonograms, medication, and all the other hi-tech stuff that makes it easier - and more complex - to both diagnose and treat different pregnancy ailments.    Also, a previous reviewer mentioned that Tess was shot as she was doing amateur detective work.  From what I understand in the book, it is nothing as romantic as that!  It seems she was walking along, minding her own business, when she was simply shot because. . . I won't give it away.    In general, the whole story left me cold.  Dane Lassiter . . . he's a hero?  We hear how his first wife was unfaithful to him, was cold to him, etc. etc.  What a terrible person she was.  Then, as we read further in the story, and we hear how he treated her - well, I simply see her side, totally.  I see her side more than I see his side.  And the relationship between Dan and Tess - he treated her badly before, which is why she is now afraid of him.  Okay, I can understand (barely) why he did that, but what I don't see is any kind of real apology, an understanding of how badly he hurt her. . . I would never give such a person a second chance.  Or, if I would, he sure blew it.  Okay, I hurt you, but it's my mothers fault!  I don't like people who blame other people for their problems.  Also - why did she have to work for him, if she was scared of him?  Don't tell me there were no other jobs available?  He couldn't have been paying her THAT well!    I generally rate a book on four things - how well it's written, character development, originality and complexity of the plot, and sympathetic characters.  This book deserves one star - Tess is really sweet.       I see from the reviews that Diana Palmer has alot of fans, but it seems they were looking for something very different than I was.  This was the first book that I read by this author, and it's obvious that my taste and her style don't mesh.  However, Diana Palmer has a lot of fans, and it's just my opinion!	2004-07-05

In all romance books I've read so far, the protaganists are easily identifiable from almost the first page.  Not so in this book.  Susannah goes through an awful lot of life until she finally finds her true love.<br />But all SEP's books are five stars, and this is no exception.<br />What I liked:<br />1. This book is unbelievably well written, as are all of SEP's books.  The book flows naturally, the words just pull you in. The descriptions are unbelievable, and the dialogue snappy, precise and - believable.  (Okay, Susannah must have an IQ of 160 or so, but still.)<br />2. The author does a great job in setting up Susannah's life in such a way that we can see the complexity and growth of her personality. We see her evolving from an abused five year old to the Susannah at the end of the book.  And SEP makes us understand exactly why she made the choices she did, and as Susannah explains - each choice was the right choice at that time.  Those people who are upset at Susannah for marrying Sam are missing the point - she had to marry Sam at that point in her life - not, of course, because that's the plot - but rather because this part of her life was necessary in order for her to grow into the person she ultimately became.<br />3. Unlike some other books that I have read, where the heroines go through all kinds of psychological trauma in an extremely unrealistic manner, Susannah reacts exactly the way a real person might in real life - albeit a really spunky person - in other words - a heroine.  Every scene, every word, every reaction - is extremely realistic.  Of course, most people would NOT react as well as Susannah - which is why she is a heroine, of course!  But in alot of other books, when I finish it I think - oh, this would never happen in real life.  People just don't react that way.  I NEVER felt that way in this book.<br />4. Uh, did I mention I loved Susannah?<br />What I didn't like:<br />1. This book was so long, and so detailed, it took me forever to get to the end.  But then again, more of SEP's wonderful writing to enjoy?<br />2. I wish the ending was a little longer.  I had a hard time picturing Susannah and (blank - I don't want to give away the ending) together, because there is so little interaction between them in the whole book.  (What you're getting is their thoughts and feelings - but there is a big difference between fantasy and real life.)  I just wanted to see them together more, that's all.  I guess I just want more SEP!	2004-06-29

This is the first book I have read by Mary Jo Putney, and it looks like I just discovered a new author.<br />Ms. Putney seems to have done her research; at first I thought the premise of the book to be unbelievable in the extreme - but it seems that there was indeed a similar club in that time period!  Well, there's something that I certainly didn't learn in school!<br />The book is extremely well-written, the premise is original, the characters complex - everything I look for in a good book.  If I found it a little too long - well, that's only because of my time crunch (I wanted to get to the end, already!) but that's hardly something to detract from a book when it's this well written.  It seems to me that Ms. Putney is one of those writers where you feel as if every word she put down on paper was meant to be there - that, combined with a daring and original story makes her one of the best.<br />You can't help feeling for Kit, and, although another reviewer found it odd that she would go to such great lengths to help her sister, I don't find it odd, but rather touching - and rare.  I also did not find the &quot;twin thing&quot; unbelievable as other reviewers did - these things really do happen in real life (both that she &quot;found&quot; another twin, and that she could &quot;feel&quot; what her twin is feeling - at least to some degree).  <br />In short, if what you are looking for is good writing, an original and daring plot, with a touch of the dark side thrown in - this is the book for you.	2004-06-14
US	34914255	R37EXB4QRZF2BZ	0451402642	335788191	The Gilded Cage	Books	3	1	1	N	N	NOT my favorite romance novel	This book is well written, however, it failed to pull me into the story.  First, it is very wordy - you have to read at least five chapters to have any idea of where the book is going, and even then, the prose winds and winds in such an obscure way that I didn't always understand what Ms. Layton was trying to say.  I thought I was finished with that kind of writing when I graduated school.  Second, the novel has too many sad parts to it.  I like a romance novel to be happy, I don't want to read a novel to be reminded about all the unhappiness, unfairness, and suffering in the world.  I get enough of that on the news.  <BR>Third, the romance takes a bit too long to develop, for my taste - and when it does - they seem to fall in love for no real reason that I can see - and the author does not give us any sense of understanding why Josh prefers Lucy over Gloria - is it because Lucy is prettier? He met Lucy first?  She is more educated? (She's not).  I rather liked Gloria, actually, and wanted to see more of a reason for his preference to Lucy (besides that it's a better story).<br />To Ms. Layton's credit, there are some good points, too, and here they are: First, like I said, it's pretty well written.  Second, you do get swept away into that time period - and Ms. Layton portrays the mood and scent of New York of that era very, very, accurately.  Living in New York today, I see it exactly the way she describes it - certainly very close to the New York my grandparents lived in.  This is an excellent portrayal of New York post-Civil War.<BR>Third, the ending was really, really good.  Although the first part of the book is very slow going, towards the end it builds up, and the ending leaves you with a very satisfied feeling.<br />Edith Layton is a good writer, but in my opinion, not great.  A little too slow, and a little too much realism for my taste.	2004-06-13
US	34914255	R3NW4PCFI7LE23	0743459210	411049844	The Duchess	Books	3	20	23	N	N	Interesting story, but the ending falls flat.	I like all of Jude Deveraux's book (well, almost all).  This book starts off interesting, and there is alot of background info. that shows that JD really did her research on the time period, and the dynamics of an heiress - duke relationship.  The characters are really funny, and the story has a lot of twists and turns which certainly held my interest.<br />However, the main drawback of the story to me was this - Trevalyn, while certainly a most interesting character, has many flaws which I find hard to forgive, the main one being that, at the same time that he is becoming close to Clare, he is leading her to believe that he has other relationships at the same time.  I've read through the book, and I never heard him deny it.  How can he expect Clare to declare herself to him unconditionally when he doesn't make a single move to reassure her?  Not only that, he seems to go out of his way to point out to her that he is not capable of a monogamous relationship.  And even at the end of the novel, he never bothers reassuring Clare on that point.  I have a problem with the hero of a romance novel acting that way.<br />I am surprised that no previous reviewer mentioned this, as Trevalyn actually said he might find it hard to stay in a monogamous realtionship - that really spoiled the book for me.<br />I am also surprised at the relatively high ratings this book received, with some of her newer books, which in my opinion are actually better, getting lower ratings.	2004-03-28
US	34914255	R59EMGUBYF5XB	0743477081	483345313	Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Not her best book.	I liked Forever - okay, I didn't love it, but it was a good book, interesting reading. With Forever and Always - things start to change.<br />First of all, this is not even a tiny drop a romance novel.  I don't like the hero (hero??) what is he exactly??  and I don't like the storyline.  <br />In this story, Darci is alone, Adam is missing - either dead or something, the book mysteriously hints something about being under ice.  In my opinion, a romance novel is not supposed to end with the hero being under ice, and the heroine - that's Darci - being told that her marriage is not important, it's her mission in life that's more important.  That's strike one for me - romance novels are supposed to be happily ever after, in my opinion.  <br />This book doesn't seem to go anywhere.  There's a mystery, Darci has to use her psychic powers to solve the mystery.  That's it.  Along the way she gets to meet all kinds of ghosts and beings - who tell her that she has to solve this to go further in some kind of game.  This book seems to me to be somewhat of a filler between two books - Forever - and presumably a third book.  Nothing much happens in this book, at least to Darci and Adam. That's strike two.<br />Strike three, this book is so unrealistic as to be ridiculous.  In Forever, although Darci comes across as well, different, she seems normal, just a little psychic.  Here, I feel like I fell down Alice's hole.  She seems to have presumably worked on her gifts to enhance them (is that possible?  I thought that psychics were like either born, or not, at least that's how they're usually portrayed).  In this book, she does come across like a real freak.  It's hard to believe that her psychic gifts have become so much more in just a few years - well, to me it's really unrealistic.  The first novel, you get the feeling that it COULD be true - the things she does are not SO SO much out of the ordinary.  And that she's also a real person, who just happens to have some gifts.  In Forever and Always, she's not real anymore, she turns into a freak, or a heroine out of a ghost novel.<br />Also, I really hated the hero - I forgot his name - plus, he doesn't seem to have any role at all except as a sidekick to Darci while Adam is missing - he doesn't turn into the hero or anything, so what's he doing there?<br />This was the first book I have read by JD that I really didn't like.	2004-02-24
US	34914255	R20IUPIUV8BYS7	0743437128	661143336	Wild Orchids: A Novel (Deveraux, Jude)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	One of the best books I ever read!	I really think this is Jude Deveraux's best book!<br />This book was interesting, funny, and even macabre, all at the same time.  I loved the characters Ford and Jackie, they seemed to really come alive in this book.  Jackie is really funny, the relationship between Jackie and Ford is very realistic, and the way the story keeps moving . . . well, only Jude Deveraux has that much imagination.<br />Wild Orchids is a story of second love - a second chance, as it were, for happiness - who says you can't get lucky twice?  What makes it more interesting, and a better book, in my opinion, is that it is a little different, the romance is not a typical one love forever, and the story is not typical, actually the whole book is not typical.  In the end, Ford does actually have to choose - between his first love, which he was indeed very much in love, and Jackie - and the way he chooses - well, I don't want to give away the story, but I thought the ending was just perfect. <br />I was puzzled by the negative comments I saw posted about her latest books, so, as a latecomer to Jude Deveraux, and having very much enjoyed her newest books, I turned to the older books to see what other reviewers are comparing it to.  I have to say, I do see that there's a difference in the kinds of books she's writing now as opposed to then, but I think her newer books are actually better in some ways.  There is much more action, much better writing, the plots don't stay still for a second - need I go on?  I personally like the newer books much better.<br />If you're a dye hard fan of Jude Deveraux's older books, perhaps Wild Orchids will be a disappointment, as the style and content is very different from her older books.  It's also not as much a steamy romance as the others.  Even so, it's hard to understand the negative reviews.  Even if this were JD's worst - which it isn't by a long shot - she's always, consistently a good writer. Her strength is always the amazing storylines that she can comeup with plus the characters are always funny, always have plenty to say!  I've never read a JD book that I didn't enjoy, and in my opinion, Wild Orchids was really one of her best.	2004-02-24
US	34914255	R13Y4165IK8WGS	0671786466	118811339	Paradise County	Books	2	4	7	N	N	The psycho killer was a little too realistic.	I try not to review a book based on the moral message, but rather on the quality of the book itself, but this time I just could not do it.<br />I could not believe this book is supposed to be a romance.  Ms. Robards has the talent - as usual - of making you feel that you are right there in the story - she has the ability to make her scenes come really alive.  I am sorry that she uses this talent to give us the mind and feelings of a psycho - and sorry that I read it.<br />What previous reviewers failed to mention - as far as I saw - was that the graphic violence was not limited to dogs!  He abducts women, too, obviously - about twenty over ten years - or more - and there is a little too much detail for me.  A lot!  Yes, nothing actually happens to Alex - the heroine - but the other women were also human beings - I can't believe I read this.  And I can't believe that people who read this are only bothered about the dog!<br />I read romance to escape from all this - from the frying pan into the fire, in this case.<br />And, yes, besides for all that, the book is good.  Just not romance.	2004-01-29
US	34914255	R31D2GD182NBPE	0440221080	849749795	Sea Fire	Books	5	3	6	N	N	very very well written book.	I think this book deserves five stars, because it is after all, an exceptionally well written book.  No, I don't like Jon, or what he does, but it is still a very, very good book.<br />Let's face it, the reason this is an historical romance - the story is set in the times it is - is because naturally, no man would be able to act like that nowadays - and get away with it, as a previous reviewer so aptly pointed out.  But, in those days this was normal behavior for a man - Jon is even, actually, one of the better ones - Jon does treat Cathy kindly in his own way, seemingly the only way he knows how.  The author does not whitewash his bad behavior - merely showing that he is human, and there is good with the bad.  As he pointed out to Cathy - he didn't actually beat her - in his mind, at least, he felt justified.  If you look back at history, in those days women were treated pretty badly - especially in some countries.<br />Actually, the whole tone of the book is pretty bloody - pirates, people getting killed left and right - and is unsettling for modern day sensibilities, but it does accurately reflect the times JOn and Cathy lived in.<br />Karen Robards is an excellent writer, I think she's one of the best writers, period.  Her characters seem so real, you almost believe they are right there besides you, and her writing is really flawless.  No, I don't think Jon is right, and I don't think I would like him at all in real life, but it is a tribute to Ms. Robards skill that I can't help liking him in the book.  <br />I think it's only fair to rate this book five stars for being a really good book.  Look, you don't have to live with him!  It's just a book!  I agree that if you have suffered some trauma, you should not read this book - and people who were ever victims of real crimes should not read thrillers and mysteries.	2004-01-21
US	34914255	R1X6NC4Z44LB72	0671739727	635712327	Highland Velvet	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Jude Deveraux is always a good writer.	This novel is second in the Velvet series, and since I only read the first one so far, I liked this one better.<br />This was a really great book!  Very romantic, and the hero, Stephen, is probably the most likable hero of a JD book that I've read so far.<br /> I've read other reviewers say that they didn't like Brondwyn, and that she's too strong and too shrewish, however, I disagree.  As a general rule, I don't like the really strong heroine, but in this book I understand where Brondwyn is coming from.  She is a clan leader, and as such has to be strong, as she is responsible for the safety of her clan.  She leads them during battles, helps defend them against the enemy, and tries to settle disputes.  In short, she is a real leader, and you can't expect her to suddenly change into a warm and loving wife.  She does do that eventually, but meanwhile, you uis therefore responsible for her clan.  She has to be a strong feminine character, you can't be a leader otherwise. <br />And you can't blame her for hating Stephen at first! She was taught from birth to hate the English, plus she has personally witnessed destruction that they have wraught on the Scots - on her people.  And for the icing on the cake, Stephen did stand her up at their own wedding - for a reason which even I feel is quite weak (his sister-in-law had a bad fall and a miscarriage?)  Try that one at a real wedding!  So she has every right to hate Stephen, however, I think she could have been a little little softer, to make her a more sympathetic female heroine.<br />The hero of the story, Stephen, seems almost too good to be true.  He falls so completely in love with Brandwyn, that he is willing to do anything for her, despite the fact the she hardly appreciates it.  He is also very articulate - I found his explanations very well thought out, and it's no wonder that Brondwyn is eventually won over to fall in love with him.  I just find it hard to see WHY he was so crazy over her, but that's what romancenovels are all about, right?  <br />If you're looking for an interesting historical romance, with a strong heroine and an almost ideal hero, this is the story for you.	2004-01-04
US	34914255	R3NEC3AKN8VLM6	0671014196	624491085	The Summerhouse	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Interesting and thought provoking	This is the first book I have read by Ms. Deveraux, but it will certainly not be my last.  I am not a big fan of time travel science fiction, so I didn't like that part, but I really loved the writing,  and the way things turned out for all of them.  And there were so many truths in this book that some other reviewers seemed to have missed!  First of all, someone suggested that the premise that it was all three of thems birthday is pretty far-fetched - actually it's brillian, not far-fetched at all.  They were all three there to renew licenses that had just expired, and licenses expire on you birthday! DUH!  And it was not a coincidence at all that the bakery had a birthday cake for them (NOT Ira), because it seemed that Ira did this all the time.  Read it again and you'll see.<BR>The story line of their first life is not far-fetched at all - when you go through something like that personally, you know that it can really happen.  <BR>The truth is that even if you do have a career - and these three women all seemed to have fabulous careers - what truly matters in the end is really the men - or family - in your life - it's the relationships that can make or break a person.  You see that even with a great career,  Ellie got totally broken by this ex of hers.  At that point she had nothing - no career, no husband, etc.  And anyways - if you don't think men are important - then why are you reading a romance novel?  What happened to Ellie may sound unrealistic, but from personal experience I can tell you that its not.  No matter how smart you think you are, if the other person really wants to break you - its scary how easy it is. I was really glad to see how she went back to fix THAT up!   <br />And Madison - that story, although horrible, could have really happened - poor girl marries rich guy who really treats  her badly - and who does she have to complain to?  What choices does she have? You have to realize that Madison was a poor girl from nowhere - when she saw beautiful girls are a dime a dozen in New York,  she got scared and ran home.  She probably felt she didn't have too many choices - and certainly not the confidence to do anything to really get anywhere in big big New York.  The only way she WAS able to change her past was by using confidence gained over the years - not something she would have been able to do originally.<br />Only a heart of stone would not be happy for Madison the way it turns out in the end, but I really loved the ending for Leslie - it was just so perfect.   I really love happy endings.<BR>Don't be fooled by other reviews - this is a really great book.	2003-11-09
