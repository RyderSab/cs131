Snepp, a CIA analyst, was an eye witness to the events leading up to the American evacuation on April 30, 1975. The CIA took offense at Snepp's account and I understand he has never received a penny in royalties for the book.      \\"Decent Interval\\" tells the story of the last three years of the American war in Vietnam, but most of the book is focused on the North Vietnamese offensive of Spring 1975 that led to the fall of the South Vietnamese government and the sudden, panicky flight of thousands of Americans from Vietnam.   The story is told as seen from Snepp's eyes in Vietnam although he obviously interviewed hundreds of people in coming up with a full, complex account of who was doing what in those last frantic days in which the Americans were preparing to evacuate -- but hoping against hope that some sort of graceful exit could be negotiated.  It couldn't and Snepp's theme is that people like Henry Kissinger and Ambassador Graham Martin gambled with lives -- especially Vietnamese lives -- by holding on to delusion too long.     Unlike Iraq, Vietnam was a picturesque war with lots of sex, booze, drugs, and rock n roll mixed in with the violence and human tragedy. \\"Decent Interval\\" captures the compelling atmosphere of the country. The book is often confusing with its plethora of characters, places, and scenes -- not unlike the chaotic situation in Vietnam.  There is abundant heroism and nobility in these pages, as there is stupidity and venality.  Ambassador Martin is probably the chief villain, but one has to feel a certain twinge of regret for him, thrust as he was into a no win situation. When writing this book, Snepp still burned with disgust and shame at the ignomious American rout -- and settles some scores with those he blames.                Smallchief	2005-10-13

In the decades following the crucifixion of Christ all manner and forms of Christian belief and worship flourished in the eastern part of the Roman empire.  The author describes a number of these movements and philosophies and their writings. Some were Jewish and followed Jewish law, such as the Ebionotes; some were anti-Jewish and rejected Jewish law, such as the Marcionites; some were diverse and deeply-philosophical such as the Gnostics.  The proponents of each produced their written propaganda, often self-serving accounts of Jesus's supposed teachings or accounts of Jesus supposedly authored by one or another of his disciples.      Ehrman sorts out the forgeries and tells what we know of the literature that wasn't deemed worthy of being included in the New Testament by the \\"proto-orthodox\\" Church leaders.  He tells a fascinating tale of a possible modern day forgery by a biblical scholar alongside an ancient forgery of the \\"Gospel of Thomas.\\"  He devotes two chapters to the Gnostics, a movement which can resonate today with the sophistication of their thought.  Unfortunately, many of the early Christian writings have been lost so only a fragmentary description of them and the sects they represented is possible.  One suspects, however, that early Christianity was as diverse as it is today, encompassing as it does everything from snake charmers to Papal pomp.           \\"Lost Christianities\\" is written in a lively style that is comprehensible to the non-specialist (me!).  Like sausage making, the making of the New Testament was not always a admirable blend of choice ingredients.  Non-believers could conclude that it was arbitrary and accidental; believers would see the hidden hand of God winnowing the worthy from the unworthy in creating the world religion of Christianity. The highest praise I can give a book is that it inspired me to explore the subject more deeply and \\"Lost Christianities\\" has done that.      Smallchief	2005-10-11

But the first two sections can be skipped by most people.  Section one, \\"The Encircled River\\" is about the Kobruk River, and section two, \\"What they Were Hunting For\\" is a funny tale of the defunct effort to establish a new Alaskan capital city.    Section three, titled \\"Coming into the Country\\" describes the people and region of Eagle, population 100 plus a loose scattering of rural homesteaders.  The time is the late 1970s when Alaskan lands are being divided up into national parks, native american, state, federal and private lands.  McPhee seems to have interviewed about everybody in Eagle to get a cross section of views -- most of them anti-government and libertarian. He probes deep into the Alaska psyche by simply recording what people told him.        What of the homesteaders?  I admire their individuality and hardiness -- but their bulldozers and airplanes seem incompatible with living simply in the woods.  Someone once said that the greatest boon to homesteaders was food stamps; thus their lifestyle is more than a bit artificial and dependent upon there being very few people inhabiting large areas of land.  On the other hand, do the \\"posey sniffers\\" (as they call environmentalists) have the right to dictate to Alaskans how they conduct themselves and what they do with their land?  Would New Yorkers on Fifth Avenue resent Alaskan advice on the management of Central Park?      The struggle between the environmentalists and the Alaskans continues to this day.  In the little town of Wrangell last summer, the Greenpeace ship \\"Arctic Sunrise\\" paid a call and was promptly slapped with a summons for violating environmental laws.  Greenpeace fled the scene, but was convicted of failing to have an \\"oil spill prevention plan,\\" which seems a serious omission by an outfit that protests oil spills for a vocation.       I'd like to see an update of McPhee's book.  What's happened to the homesteaders he interviewed?  I suspect that most of them have long since abandoned their cabins and returned to civilization, possibly to be replaced by a new group seeking the solace in the wilderness that is the goal of both homesteaders and posey sniffers, each in his own way.  This is a good book of objective reporting which both groups can enjoy.             Smallchief	2005-10-08

The author, Roy Moxham. captures some of that charm in this book -- but doesn't neglect describing the seamy side of British colonialism in India, China, Sri Lanka, and Africa.  Moxham doesn't go much into botanical descriptions of tea or growing and harvesting techniques, but focuses on the history of tea consumption and production.    Moxham catalogs the growing addiction of the British to tea in the 18th century and the efforts of British colonialists to grow the stuff in the 19th and 20th century.  The story of tea growing in the Assam district of India is dirty indeed -- typical of colonial ventures around the world. Some of the stories of the exploitation of workers during the early days of tea growing are horrific.  The author also describes briefly the principal tea dealers in England, past and present, and their marketing techniques. So addicted are Britains to the daily 'cuppa' that tea during World Wars of the Twentieth Century was considered a vital commodity.          One of the more interesting sections of the book was the author's brief description of his work on a tea estate in Malawi (Nyasaland) in the 1960s.  The book concludes abruptly as he finishes his first year on the estate, giving the impression that a sequel may be in the works.    This is a good little book with a few illustrations and maps, a list of the various kinds of tea, and a good bibliography for those inspired to dig more deeply into the subject.

He was a teacher of English before he became a professional writer and thus he brings credentials to this book about language and linguistics.      \\"Mouthful of Air\\" is written for British readers and Americans may find some of the discussions of British pronunciation a bit esoteric and mysterious.  Being a sloppy-voweled American I didn't really comprehend the subtle differences the author perceives in pronunciation of the words \\"marry merry Mary,\\" for example.  They sound the same to me.  Thus, his technical discussions of vowel differences did not resonate in differing vibrations to my inner ear.  I would likewise question the author's opinion that the phonetic alphabet should be required learning in school. That would be about as useful as reinstituting Latin as a required course.      Burgess divides his book into two parts.  Part one deals with technical aspects of language.  For example, he titles one graphic, \\"Chart of Consonants According to their Organs of Articulation.\\"  The consonants are then divided into stop plosives, nasals, laterals, fricatives, glides, and affricates.  Whew! I don't think I would want to be in an English class with Burgess as a teacher. Amongst discussion of affricates and fricatives, however, are some interesting chapters on the development of the Indo-European tongues and brief chapters on Malay and Japanese to show how they differ from Indo-European languages.      Part two is about English -- mostly British English, but also American, Australian, and Scottish. He briefly examines dialects, literature, \\"low life\\" language, and the influence of the Bible on language.  A minority of people will find his technical discussions instructive. The author defines his objective as pedagogic and the reader should expect some hard sledding if he wishes to comprehend every last word in this book. However, I suspect that the majority of us will skip blithely over words like \\"alveolar\\" and enjoy the rest of the book -- which is informative and fascinating.      Smallchief	2005-10-04

Why, in heaven's name, would anyone locate a huge scientific laboratory on top of a mesa reached only by a dirt road, tens of miles from a town, a railroad, and an airport?  The selection of Los Alamos by the dynamic duo of leaders, General Leslie Groves and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, probably cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs and may have delayed the completion of the bomb itself.    Well, if Los Alamos was a poor choice on economic and scientific grounds, it was a great dramatic and artistic choice.  Author Conant in \\"109 East Palace\\" does a wonderful job depicting the clear air and casual culture of New Mexico and the makeshift colony of nuclear physicists living up on the magic mesa.  The book is based on the observations of Dorothy McKibbin, a social secretary, gatekeeper, and \\"Girl Friday\\" of the Los Alamos Lab, a widow who loved extravagantly -- although perhaps platonically -- the charismatic scientific leader, Robert Oppenheimer.  Author Conant, however, although admiring of Oppie, does not hesitate to point out his warts -- of which he seems to have had an epidemic.      This book is not a scientific account of the building of the bomb, but a social history of the wartime community of Los Alamos and the scientists and military officers who made up its population. Oppenheimer is the enigmatic center of the group, but the author also paints portraits of the blunt Groves, the appealing Fermi, the spy Fuchs, and many others of the cast of characters inhabiting Los Alamos.     \\"109 East Palace\\" concludes with the dramatic story of the Trinity test of the atomic bomb, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Oppie's post war political problems which led to him being denied a security clearance by the government.  This is a serious book about the making of the most destructive weapon ever used, but it's also entertaining and instructive for those of us who never could remember the difference between fusion and fission.  The tale of Oppie and the bomb is one of the most intriguing and controversial chapters in all of American history.       Smallchief	2005-09-30

India -- the jewel in the crown of the British empire --was deep in the consciousness of British society and generations of young, ambitious Brits sallied off to India to make their careers as civil servants, soldiers, merchants, or missionaries.      The book is organized by themes in each chapter.  A chapter on households describes the homes and servants the British had, \\"The Club\\" tells of that famous British institution transferred to the sub-continent, \\"Hazard and Sport\\" is about polo, hunting, tennis, and pig-sticking.  Every aspect of life in India is taken up in 21 chapters.  It was not an easy life for the colonials, but it was impossibly exotic, witness the popularity of writers such as Rudyard Kipling and Somerset Maugham.  Rigid British notions of race and class fit well with Indian caste laws; otherwise India was as different from Great Britain as it could possibly be. That the colonial enterprise was rotten at the core was concealed by stiff upper lips and a government that was \\"probably the most incorruptible ever known.\\"      \\"Plain Tales\\" includes a brief biography of each of the interviewees who represent a cross section of British society in India and a glossary of Anglo Indian words (pukka = proper). This book presents a bird's eye view of the life of British subjects in India and their interaction with their  unwilling Indian hosts, the environment, and their fellows.  It's all a really fascinating tale. And, finally, in 1947 when the British had to go, they threw their topees -- those ridiculous cork hats -- into the sea and returned to England and Home.

Nowhere was this resisted more strongly than China.  To put it bluntly, the Chinese hated Western civilization and Christianity and the merchants, opium traders, diplomats, and missionaries who were its agents.         This book tells the story of American and British missionaries in one Chinese city, Foochow (now Fuzhou). The missionaries were greeted with hostility by local Chinese when they arrived in 1847 -- as guests of the opium dealers -- and the hostility continued with the years. The results of the missionaries' work were miniscule.  It was 9 years before they baptized their first convert.  During that 9 years, 35 missionaries worked in Foochow but over half of them either died or returned home.  Life was tough for a missionary in more ways than one.        The relations bewtween the missionaries in Foochow and the local Chinese were spiced with riots and land disputes as somnolent and corrupt Chinese officials were gradually forced to deal with the pushy Westerners. In the missionaries' defense, it was they more than anyone else who created the generation of semi-Westernized Chinese who would take over leadership of the country in the 20th century.       The author draws most of his material from primary sources, especially the letters home of the missionaries themselves.  He has a useful list at the end of the book of all the missionaries serving in Foochow between 1847 and 1880, voluminous footnotes, and a good bibliography.  If you are interested in missionaries, nineteenth century China, or relations between China and the West this is an excellent birds-eye view of events on the ground in one city in China.

Despite being physically timid, he survived a lot of adventures, including typhoons and being bombarded by the Japanese.      <br /> <br />This is a typical academic book: expensive, 200 pages long, extensive notes and bibiography, a few illustrations, and an index.  It's better that most, perhaps reflecting the quality of the diaries and other records that Parker left behind and perhaps reflecting the quality of the writing. The author discusses with impressive authority Parker's medical as well as his diplomatic skills.  Parker was apparently quite good at both.   <br /> <br />This is a worthwhile book about the early days of American relations with China as well as being a biography of a significant American historical figure. Persons with interest in missionaries, 19th century medicine, or China will enjoy it.           <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-09-23

She did so in 1924, a small woman in her mid-50s, disguised as a beggar and accompanied only by her adopted Tibetan son.  This was the highlight of a life that lasted until 1969 when she died at age 100.    As the authors point out, however, practically nothing can be said with surety about Mme. David-Neel.  One biographer has even claimed that she fabricated the whole story of visiting Lhasa.  Probably not -- although she fabricated a lot and was hardly of unimpeachable character.  As a matter of fact, although the authors are very respectful of her, she seems a thoroughly selfish, self-centered and repellent person.    David-Neel was a serious student of Buddhism and wrote many books on the subject.  One of the juiciest parts of the book concerns the question of whether she participated in group Tantric sex rituals. The authors conclude she probably did.  David-Neel's religion had nothing to do with morality, and it seems unlikely that she ever found inner peace from her Buddhist rituals as she suffered from an endless variety of mental and physical ills. Still, living to be 100 is quite an accomplishment...     Alexandra David-Neel was an opera singer, a hardy and determined traveler, a student of religion, a writer, and a public figure of some note.  Some of her papers are still unreleased so the final word about her character and achievements is still to be said.  In the meantime this is an entertaining and well-researched biography.

Despite some reservations, I'll give this book a top rating based on the quality of the scholarship.  The author defines his aims in the preface: to \\"do full justice\\" to Alexander's achievements -- but \\"respecting the limits of the evidence and of the historian's craft.\\" Many of the popular biographers of Alexander have made of him what they wished him to be.  Cartledge reminds the reader over and over of the paucity of solid information about Alexander's nature and character.     This is not the book to read first if you don't know much about Alexander the Great.  The author presumes you are familiar with the outlines of his life and jumps into thematic descriptions. Chapter titles include: Alexander and the Greeks, The Divinity of Alexander, and The Generalship of Alexander.  He is conservative with his sources and what emerges is a bare-bones outline of Alexander's life.  Speculation is clearly labeled.  We have few flights of fancy about Alexander's love life or his supposed aims to create an empire of universal peace and brotherhood.         In taking a narrow view of Alexander, what emerges is not overly favorable.  That's fine.  Alexander is also one of the enigmatic persons of history and he will be seen as a monster by some and as an enlightened idealist by others -- although all those massacres are hard to explain away.  Cartledge is probably more reliable than most in writing of Alexander and he attempts to enliven the story with an occasional attempt at humor or frivolity. The maps of Alexander's five great battles are outstanding.       Smallchief	2005-09-19

The author is fascinated with why some languages became more important and widely-spoken than others and the relationship of language to empire.  He asserts quickly that history offers no pattern or pat solution to this question.<br /><br />Among the language histories that Ostler examines are the very-wide ranging Afro-Asiatic group, which encompasses Arabic, Aramaic, and Coptic among others, Turkish, Persian, Chinese, Sanskrit, Greek, and the major European languages.  He focuses mostly on the literate Old World languages, although he has a chapter on Quechua and Nahuatl, the languages of the Incas and Aztecs respectively. As could be expected in a wide-ranging book, I found some chapters to be more interesting and informative than others.  Scattered amongst the chapters are plenty of good maps and a large number of quotations and reproductions of inscriptions from a large number of languages.  This is a well-produced book.<br /><br />I'll give this book the highest rating, but I must comment that I was a bit disappointed with the cautious conclusions of the author.  One of his more interesting statements was that Arabic, an Afro-Asiatic language, became established only in \\"territories that had previously spoken an Afro-Asiatic language\\" That suggests that the conquest of one language over another may have something to do with the similarity in structure of the language -- or, in other words, English is not likely to supplant Chinese or the reverse.  This point is not really developed to its fullest extent. Also, the section of the book I most look forward to was \\"What makes a language learnable?\\" but it is very brief.  I would liked to have seen a lot more discussion of his point that \\"the essence of a language, its structure, can play a role in its viability.\\"  That's a dangerous and intriguing statement in that it implies that some languages are \\"better' than others, a point that deserves more examination.<br /><br />Smallchief	2005-09-15

The author attempts to redress some of this imbalance with this story of the Jiangyin Mission Station of the Southern Presbyterian Church near Shanghai, China.  The home church of the Station was in Wilmington, NC which may make the book of especial interest to Carolinians.      The author has turned out a good academic history of the Station and the American missionaries who staffed it. Jiangyin began life with an anti-Christian riot -- the missionaries were accused of killng children to take their organs for medicine, an echo of the common rumors around the world today that Westerners kill children to steal their organs for transplant.  Over the years the Mission was accepted by many in the Chinese community -- although converts were few and far between.  The author includes maps and photos plus a lot of detail about how missionaries lived and worked. An especially good chapter details the trials and tribulations of the missionaries when Japan invaded the region in 1937 and, finally, forced the closing of Jiangyin on December 8, 1941. The Church opened Jiangyin after WW II, but it was closed permanently by the Chinese Communists in 1951. The history of Jiangyin is pretty typical of hundreds of Mission stations in China.                Well, this is a subject with a limited readership and -- however well done this book -- I have to wonder why academic books of such limited sales potential are not simply published on the web as ebooks and made available free to the general public.  The author surely does not get rich off the royalties.     Smallchief	2005-09-15

Rachel and Will Johnson were a Pennsylvania couple who went to Northern India as missionaries in 1860 and served there until 1884.  This book is a compilation of Rachel's letters to her family along with a few from her husband and children.   <br /> <br /> Rachel doesn't talk much about the husband's work but focuses on the daily life of a missionary family in India, replete with servant problems, frequent illness -- two of the Johnson's eight children were to die in India -- and the often touchy personal relations of missionaries and other foreigners thrown together in strange and hostile environments.  We get a pretty good picture of her personality and daily life.  She was opinionated and, as is typical, had little respect for the religions of the local Muslims and Hindus.  She also seems to have been at odds with the single missionary women who, toward the end of the Johnsons' life in India, made up a growing and important element in missionary work. Rachel's barely restrained fury at the encroachments of the single women makes for some of the best reading in the book.    <br /> <br /> Rachel died of a horse and buggy accident in 1888 in North Carolina.  Will returned to India after her death to resume missionary work and died in 1926, sixty-six years after he and his young wife first came to India.      <br /> <br /> The editor, a descendant of the Johnsons, adds introductions to the letters and explanatory footnotes plus photographs, maps, and charts.  There is more that could be done in identifying people mentioned in the letters and events briefly described and the quality of the letters is such that additional scholarship would be warranted.   I've read a lot of books by professional travel writers which weren't as informative as this collection of letters.  I recommend the book highly for those interested in India, missionaries, and nineteenth century American women. <br /> <br />Smallchief <br />	2005-09-11

This is a collection of his journalistic writings and essays in the 1970s and 1980s.  Among the topics he writes about are \\"Vinegar Joe\\" Stilwell, Douglas MacArthur, missionaries, Mao's cultural revolution, American perceptions of China, and a review of John Hersey's, \\"The Call,\\" which is a favorite novel of mine.     <br /> <br />Coming near the end of his 50 years of study of China I expected a bit more in weighty analysis and insight from Fairbank than this book offers.  Most of these pieces are pretty superficial. I was also slightly irritated by Fairbank's occasional comments about the political scene in the US which had little or no relevance to China. Fairbank's message is that the Chinese are different from you and I and it's not just because we have more money.  Western thought emphasizes \\"individual striving;\\" China emphasizes \\"collective harmony.\\" Westerners have rights; Chinese have duties.  America is legalistic; China is not.   <br /> <br />While there are better books about China, the reader will find some of these essays to be of interest, especially Fairbank's remarks about the cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.    <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-09-07

Americans have long had an affinity for China that they do not, for example, have for India or Japan.  The author demonstrates that American attitudes toward China were often mistaken, idealizing Generalisimo and Madame Chiang -- good-solid Methodists and with a Golden Retriever at their feet as they sat companionably on a Western couch. China, the author maintains, was an extension of the Western frontier in the eyes of the missionaries and a country ripe for Americanization and Christianity.  Truth had difficulty breaking through.         Well, this is pretty well-plowed ground and American misconceptions of foreign countries have been pretty common.  Whatever the mistakes of Luce and others in looking at China through rosy glasses they were not as far off base as those who extolled the virtues of the Soviet Union and Stalin during these same years.             The author does a good job making his point but this is a book of a type: academic, over-priced, 200 pages long, and well-researched and documented with extensive footnotes and a good bibliography.  Why can't the many books of this type -- with limited sales potential -- simply be published on the web and be available to everyone free?

It's past time for this 1987 book to be updated and republished.    <br /> <br />This is Cadillac gardening as Crockett and his successor Bob Thomson apparently had a large budget, a full toolshed, and endless time to produce a perfect garden.  My pitiful efforts never yield much in the way of edible products, but I enjoy reading about how I would grow vegetables if I were not such a lazy and shiftless person. <br /> <br />The book is broken down by months with a long list of vegetables for planting, tending, and harvesting for each month as well as other garden tasks.  The monthly labors are for Boston.  Being further south, I tend to do things a month earlier in the spring and a month later in the fall than Thomson prescribes.  \\"The New  Victory Garden\\" is full of solid gardening advice for an establishmentarian gardener.  If you're into organics or (like me) inclined to low-impact, no inputs type cultivation, you might not like Thomson's reliance on chemical fertilizers -- but he makes up for it with good advice on compost, natural fertilizers, and lots of touchy feely stuff.  The pictures are beautiful.  Someday, in some future world I'll have a garden like this.  Yeah, sure.  Dream on!

Persons of modest means and position, such as Marine Captain John Letcher, could live like pashas on a modest salary.  Moreover, Peking had fabulous art, architecture, food, and a glorious culture to enjoy.   <br /> <br />Life was not nearly so good for the Chinese and that was why Letcher was there. He was a member of a US Marine Corps contingent with the mission of protecting foreigners and property. The Chinese had the disconcerting habit of rising up occasionally and killing the Westerners enjoying their bounty. Captain Letcher's tour in Peking was made memorable by the beginning of World War II when Japanese and Chinese troops clashed at Marco Polo Bridge, just outside Peking. What is perhaps most remarkable is how little the war between China and Japan disrupted the good life of the foreigners inside the walls of Peking although there is a sense of gathering doom in Letcher's account.   <br /> <br />This book consists of Letcher's letters and diary entries from 1936 to 1939.  A lengthy introduction, a few photos and maps, extensive footnotes, and a bibliography supplement the text.  Letcher has no startling insights or wisdom to impart, but his stories of daily life conjure up life in Peking pretty well and his eye-witness observations of the war are interesting.  \\"Goodbye Old Peking\\" is a well done book of interest to scholars and those of us who are fascinated by old time China and the Westerners who lived there. <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-09-01

Modern day authors seem to need 400 pages to do much of anything and their books are bloated with a lot of unneccesary detail. I almost tossed this book aside during the first 100 pages as it's coming-of-age theme just barely kept my interest -- Holden Caulfield in outer space.     <br /> <br />However, the science in the book is interesting enough to overcome the turgid fiction. A lost spaceship from a dying earth needs a fillup of anti-matter.  So it parks the spaceship at a nearby star, builds a world out of moons and comets to breed a labor force and as a site of an anti-matter factory.  Sixty thousand or so years later the \\"moon born\\" get a bit tired of being the slaves of the earth-born -- and they revolt.  The description of the revolt is tense and exciting.   <br /> <br />The technologies figuring in the book include anti-matter propulsion, nano-machines, artificial intelligence, and suspended animation. One of the authors must be a gardener because a lot of the book is devoted to plants and their care.   <br /> <br />If this book were tighter -- and perhaps 100 pages shorter -- it might be a science fiction classic.  It raises a lot of questions about the ethics of technology and projects a plausible scenario far into the future.   <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-08-31

Johnson sums up his own  philosophy with a quote from Alexander Pope: \\"The proper study of mankind is man.\\" His opinion of the 20th century cast of characters is scathing more often than not.            He trashes Woodrow Wilson -- a sound judgment in my opinion -- defends Harding, claims Coolidge was a good President, is lukewarm toward Hoover, considers Roosevelt frivolous and empty-headed, favors Truman, and adores Eisenhower. Churchill is his great hero.  The totalitarians -- Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler -- are depicted as venal gangsters.  Johnson is unflinchingly anti-Communist throughout, an opinion that proved sound when the rot of the Soviet Union and its satellites became obvious in the late 1980s.  (The first edition of this book was published in 1983.)  Nehru, Gandhi and many other third world personalities get tossed into the category of lawyer/politicians with little to recommend them as leaders of countries.       Fault can be found with Johnson; minor errors of fact and questionable statements dot the book -- and he rushes breathlessly on without defending many of his opinions.  However, if he argued them all out the book would be 10,000 pages long and dull as an airline steak knife. It is perhaps his tendency to be provocative that makes this history interesting -- as so many others are not.      I found particularly informative Johnson's description of how the Cold War started and his view that Hoover and Roosevelt's policies prolonged the Great Depression rather than eased it.  Many other interesting gems are hidden in \\"Modern Times.\\"Read it.  If you're a liberal you'll be infuriated now and then, but this is an intelligent and stimulating book about 70 years of the most violent and eventful century in the history of mankind.

Each of the above travelers wrote one or more books about their journeys in China.  The author focuses on their opinions about what they saw and experienced and how they were influenced by their own sense of Victorian and Western superiority. This is not a heavyweight subject and, as academic books go, this one is easy reading.  If like me you're fascinated by dusty old travel accounts this book might introduce you to an author you will want to read -- or give you some insights into an author you have read.       Why don't the academics put their books on the web and give everyone free access to them?

The \\"Oxford Companion to World War II\\" is no exception.  Within these 1,000 pages is an enormous amount of information on countries, people, events, and battles of WW II.      One can, for example, look up \\"Riom Trial\\" and get a two paragraph description of a trial of those held responsible for the fall of France.  Or a 4-line description of \\"Force Viper\\" a small British marine force in Burma.  Unfortunately, the selection of the topics worthy of a separate entry was more than a little Anglo-centric.  The US Marine Corps Raiders were far more important that \\"Force Viper\\" but for information about them one is referred to a section of the article on the USA.  Likewise, the Soviet Union is slighted. The Raid at Dieppe gets 2 columns of attention; the Battle of Stalingrad gets less than 4 columns.  Was Stalingrad more than twice as important as Dieppe?  Yes! It was a thousand times more important.      The space devoted to description of battles often seems arbitrary rather than rational.  The Normandy invasion gets 12 columns of attention; the second largest amphibious operation of the war, Okinawa, gets one column.  That's a travesty. Midway -- the crucial turning point in the war for for the United States  -- gets one measly column of attention. Another travesty. India, a British colony, gets eight pages; the battle of Iwo Jima only one column.          The most valuable parts of the book are the numerous charts illustrating nearly every facet of the war.  For example, on page 480 is a chart of Japanese production during the war including tanks, planes, and ships.  On page 306 is a list of the aggregate strength and equipment of a US infantry divison: 14,253 men, 2,012 vehicles, 58 band members, 13 chaplins, 157 30 caliber machine guns, etc. On page 117 is described and illustrated \\"the corkscrew maneuver,\\" a defensive strategy for bombers under attack by fighters.  These are samples of the gems of information found in this book that would be difficult to find elsewhere.             The above complaints notwithstanding \\"The Oxford Companion to World War II\\" is a superb reference book and every serious student of WW II should have it on his bookshelf.

They are delectable places in the high desert, and the Chiricahuas are possibly the finest of Arizona's \\"sky islands\\" -- isolated green and lush mountain ranges that rise precipitously from the desert.       The history of the Chiricahuas matches the appeal of the scenery.  Coronado marched through this region in 1540; the Apaches made it their home; and Gringo ranchers and miners arrived in the 19th century.  Billy the Kid killed his first man in the Chiricahuas; Curley Bill, John Ringo, Cochise, and Wyatt Earp are part of their history; Geronimo surrendered for the last time in 1886 just across the valley.       As is apparent from the lengthy title, the author has a sense of humor and that contributes to the appeal of this book as he plows through centuries of history and events. As he moves into the 20th century, he gets much more upclose and personal with the people -- and it's a sparse population -- who inhabit the region.  He first lived in Portal in 1936 and he knew many of the oldtimers who settled in the region. He carries the history up to about 1940 with tales of the people who tried, and usually failed, to make a living of mining and ranching in this land of little rain and less opportunity.  I love the quote heading one of his chapters: \\"Arizona would be a desirable place to live if it had more water and a better class of people.\\"  A few good black and white photographs illustrate the people and the land.        Today, as the author points out, the Chiricahuas are visited more by birdwatchers than by bandits.  That's progress, I guess. The author has done a fine job preserving and recording the history of the Chiricahuas and the people who lived here before the birdwatchers arrived.      Smallchief	2005-08-10

The editors put together three hefty volumes about the expeditions of John Charles Fremont of which this is the third.     Volume one through three include Fremont's official reports of his first two expeditions to Wyoming's South Pass in 1842 and to California and Oregon in 1843-1844, his participation in the war with Mexico, and in Volume Three his later and less successful expeditions.  In their day these accounts were best sellers and they made Fremont a national hero which led to him being the candidate for President of the new Republican party in 1856. Today, Fremont seems forgotten except by specialists -- and mostly scorned by them (Bernard de Voto called him \\"Childe Harold\\") -- and the fame of his mountain man guide, Kit Carson, as an American hero has eclipsed that of Fremont     The heart of this book is Fremont's accounts of his expeditions. He recorded the progress of his expeditions daily in the form of a diary and he was no novice at colorful writing. Possibly his wife Jessie Benton Fremont improved upon his prose before the accounts were published. Nor was he modest, but he gave credit where credit was due to his men, mostly French voyageurs, and especially Carson whose rise to prominence was due to Fremont. Fremont's writing is very readable to this day. Along with his dairy he also collected scientific and meteorological information which may be of interest to specialists. Fremont blotted his copybook with a number of egotistical fiascos but on his first two expeditions he was an appealing young man.     Supplementing Fremont's diary are a large number of letters, vouchers, and other documents related to Fremont's career and the expeditions. You can learn for example that Fremont paid his French voyageurs as little as 62 1/2 cents per day wages, but Kit Carson earned $100 per month, a hefty salary in those days for an illiterate mountain man -- and Carson was worth it. The editors provide copious notes to amplify and clarify the text. They produced a top notch multi-volume book of scholarship that's also fun to read.     Smallchief	2005-08-10

It's about as isolated a place as can be found in the eastern United States, still reachable only by ferry.  Traditionally, a few hundred people eked out a living on the island by fishing, piloting vessels, and salvaging wrecked vessels -- of which there were plenty in the treacherous waters off Cape Hatteras.  Blackbeard the pirate raided in these waters.  In recent decades, Ocracoke has become a tourist destination, but it's still relatively unspoiled by the standards of ticky-tacky beach resorts.  Most of the island is now a National Park         The author, a high school teacher, is a descendant of the early residents of Ocracoke and he interlaces stories of his own experiences with interviews of old-timers, historical accounts, and descriptions of present day (1980s) trends and issues.  His chapter-long account of his mullet fishing expedition with a pair of old time fishermen is superb. He has chapters on hunting, churches, the school (94 students from K to 12), hurricanes, and history including World War II and the growth of tourism.  He also devotes a full chapter to a bittersweet interview with the matriarch of the only African-American family on the island.       \\"Ocracokers\\" is a complete and authoritative account of life in a small unique community. The text is enhanced by black and white photographs, mostly of people, and maps of the village and island, although a better map showing places mentioned in the text would be welcome.  It's worth your time to read the book and to visit Ocracoke.     Smallchief	2005-08-09

However, after struggling through the interminable interior monologue of a 3-year old violin player that opens this book, I thought: why in the world am I reading an over-stuffed mystery novel that is 700 pages long?  Don't I have something better to do with my time?  Well, I do -- I'll read a biography of Jesse James who was at least a real person and a criminal of some note.

The author tells us about the experiences of two or three dozen different British and American travelers to China, their impressions of the country, and how those impressions were influenced by their Western colonialist mentality.   <br /> <br />I read the book primarily to see what the author had to say about travel writers I am familiar with:  Isabella Bird, Peter Fleming, Edgar Snow, Agnes Smedley, and Mrs. Archibald Little.  If those names mean anything to you, you might like reading about them in this book.   <br /> <br />China was a popular destination for writers of every ilk in the 19th and early 20th century.  For me the most interesting part of this book comes toward the end when the author describes the writers who visited the Chinese communists during the 1930s and 1940s and their very real importance in describing what was then an unknown movement buried far in the interior of a very large country.  Generally, their views of the communists were highly favorable -- even fawning -- as the communists seemed to represent a departure from the China of decadence and ossification portrayed by many other writers.   <br /> <br />A few good photos accompany the text. As with most scholarly books the price of the book is outrageous.  I suppose the price is based on the anticipation of very small sales. Web publishing and print-on-demand should be considered as alternatives to make books of limited appeal such as this one more readily available at a lower price.  I can't imagine that the author will get rich on the royalties however the book is marketed.   <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-08-08

The photos illustrate the town, the British Viceroys and their minions, British and Indian, and the scenery.   <br /> <br />Simla, at a high cool 7,000 feet elevation, was the summer capital of the Raj of India from about 1830 until Indian independence in 1947.  Here, the Viceroy and British civil servants and military spent the summer months when the heat on the Indian plains was unbearable.  Simla was a place \\"where the elite and aspirants met and participated in established social rituals.\\" By 1904, some 7,000 British recreated (that seems the appropriate word) in the town during the season.      <br /> <br />Pat Barr's text of 40 pages gives a history of Simla in the 19th century, up until the first railroad was completed to the town in 1904.  For the homesick colonials, Simla was England away from England.  The text and photos illustrate a vanished world that was immensely appealing in its day for those on the higher rungs of British society. <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-08-08

None of them are deep and profound, but all are readable and interesting. \\"To China with Love\\" is about the trials and tribulations of Protestant missionaries in China.  Barr expresses perplexity as to why \\"the Taylors of Barnsley were so feverishly determined to convert the Wangs of Ningpo\\" to Christianity.  It was a mystery then, and it's still a mystery --but many a good tale can be told of the adventures and mis-adventures of the missionaries going out to China from England and the United States.      It is little recalled that the China missionaries were often the best and the brightest of Western society in the 19th century.  Most of them were college educated, many from the creme de la creme of British and American universities, and they often gave up wealth and position for an uncomfortable and dangerous life in China.  An early death, failure, and brickbats from the Chinese and many of their countrymen was often their fate.       Focusing on English missionaries, Barr tells the story of Hudson Taylor and the Chinese Inland Mission, the Cambridge Seven, the well-named Dr. Dudgeon, the equally well-named Moule brothers, Gilmour of Mongolia, and other colorful figures who stalked across China in their quixotic quest. I liked most of them.  They had a dedication, a drive and a sense of commitment that is rare in this modern, cynical world.    Chinese resentment of the West and its missionaries, soldiers, and salesmen steadily grew and culminated in the Boxer uprising of 1900 in which foreign missionaries and Chinese converts were martyred by the hundreds.  Barr ends the book with this watershed event.  The story of the missionaries in China is well worth your attention and this book is a good introduction.     Smallchief	2005-08-05

It's long, about 700 pages of text about Sir Ernest Shackleton from birth to death at 47 years, and complex, with dozens of major characters.            Shackleton was a failure at nearly everything he did.  His business ventures never panned out; he was an uncaring and indifferent husband; his expeditions never achieved what he hoped; he made enemies who stabbed him in the back.  His virtues, the author tells us, were those of the Irish including a compelling personality and a gift of gab.  He was, first and foremost, a leader of men under adversity.  In society, he was always a bit of a bounder; in Antarctica he inspired trust and awe among the members of his expeditions.             Shackleton and his rival, Sir Robert Scott, exemplified the best English tradition of the inspired amateur.  They really didn't have the skills to explore the Antarctic and they seemed impervious to learning much.  Their expeditions were one mishap after another and only Shackleton's leadership and drive saved him and his men from death on the ice. Scott was not so lucky -- or competent.  The hardships suffered by the Antarctic explorers are almost inconceivable to us today. We are better clothed for a walk in the park on a snowy day than they were for facing the worst weather this planet can devise. Therein is much of the fascination with the story: men against the elements -- and the elements have the advantage.                   Huntford tells the stories of Shackleton's three Antarctic expeditions in the early 20th century in impressive and fascinating detail.  Through it all runs Shackleton's secret fear that his heart may not be equal to the task and that he might, as happened on his first expedition, collapse and disgrace himself.

The author opens with a pre-history of the Indian tribes on the Great Plains border from Oklahoma to Iowa: the Osage, Kansa or Kaw, Omaha, Ponca, Missouri, Oto, and Iowa.  He describes the coming of the French in the 18th century and the cultural and racial mixing between the Indians and French to create a new people, neither French nor Indian, and believed by Anglos to incorporate the worst of both peoples, the \\"mixed bloods.\\" (The common term of the day, \\"half breed,\\" is deemed derogatory by the author.)  <br /> <br />The fact that French and French/Indian mixed bloods preceded the Anglos in discovering most of the United States is ignored in most histories.  Lewis and Clark found French traders as far west as the Mandan villages of North Dakota; early fur trading brigades in the Rocky Mountains included many French and Indians; and as late as the 1840s travelers such as Francis Parkman and John Charles Fremont relied on French and mixed blood guides and helpers.  We just don't hear of the French and Indians as we do of such well-know American heroes as Jim Bridger, \\"Broken Hand\\" Fitzpatrick, and others.       <br /> <br />The mixed bloods began to disappear about 1850, integrating into either White or Indian society -- although neither received them enthusiastically.  The membership rolls of Indian tribes are dotted with their names today: Pappan, Roy, Revard, Bellmard, Denoya, and many others.  The only Vice President of the United States with Indian blood, Charles Curtis, came out of this culture.  His mother's maiden name was Pappan and she was the granddaughter of the Kaw chief, White Plume.             <br /> <br />Thorne does an thorough and excellent job in telling the story of the 18th and 19th century French and Indians living on the lower Missouri River.  It's a sad story as the Indians and their French relatives were plowed under by the waves of advancing Anglos.  The author's research is impeccable; his bibiography runs to 27 pages and includes numerous eye-witness and primary sources dug out of dusty archives.  The Indian tribes on the Middle Border and the French/Indian mixed bloods are pretty much forgotten today, and the work of scholars such as Thorne in recovering memories of them is welcome.   <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-07-30

Bird was the premier woman traveler of the Victorian age and author Pat Barr competently tells the story of her life.     Isabella Bird, a short, plump English gentlewoman of unimpeachable character, acquired an incurable wanderlust about age 40 and during the next 30 years traveled and wrote books about her visits to Hawaii, Colorado, Japan, Malaya, India, Persia, Korea, and China. Isabella traveled mostly by herself, except for interpreters and local helpers. She sought out the lonely places of the world in long journeys that were near epics of adventure and hardship. At home in Scotland she was unhealthy; on the trail she was as hardy as a bristlecone pine.    The author gets most of her material directly from Isabella's many books of her travels plus an earlier biographer. Lacking in depth, \\"Curious Life\\" makes up for it with easy to read, well-organized writing, letting Isabella Bird tell much of the story with quotes from her books and letters. Reading this biography can be a substitute for reading Isabella's books, some of which run to a formidable 600 pages. However, I recommend reading \\"A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains\\" by Bird which is a classic of Western Americana.

The ruins the Mayas left behind are spectacular -- Tikal in Guatemala, featured in the movie \\"Star Wars,\\" is perhaps the greatest of them all.  However, our knowledge of the Mayas has always been limited because scholars were unable to decipher Mayan writing.  In fact, many scholars have denied that the Mayan symbols -- glyphs -- were more than doodlings, calendars, and compilatation of dates.         \\"Breaking the Maya Code\\" is not a history of the Maya civilization but rather a history of the scholars who have attempted to unravel the meaning of the enigmatic Mayan glyphs.  Coe's premise is that racial discrimination and scholarly politics retarded the decipherment of the glyphs. Amazingly, many scholars of the Maya didn't bother to learn the Mayan language.         The chief villain of the book is Sir Eric Thompson who had a strangle-hold on Mayan studies for many years.  It was only with his death in 1975 that a motley group of linguists and amateurs learned to read the glyphs -- and thus demonstrate conclusively that the Mayas possessed a written language.  The remarkable individuals who achieved this breakthrough included a Soviet scholar who had never visited Central America, a 12 year old boy, a self-described redneck woman from Tennessee, and a mathematician who began life as a Wisconsin farmboy. The dirt archeologists, \\"wielders of trowels\\" in the author's words, were unenthusiastic about the accomplishments of the linguists.          The author paints a picture of the dead hand of academia inhibiting rather than promoting the study of Mayan writing.  An archaelogist himself, he  personally knows the principal characters in his story and he was a participant in many of the key events that led to a comprehension of Mayan writing. His writing is lively, mostly warm and generous about hiscolleagues but sometimes critical, and the whole story is told in a connected narrative that reads like a novel, albeit one in which the reader is led through the complex process of how linguists learned to decipher Mayan glyphs.

Mallory mixes linguistics and archaeology in coming to his conclusions.    Given the tendency of Europeans over the last two centuries to allege racial superiority, the question as to whether there was also an Indo-European, or Aryan, race is also important. Mallory deals with this issue in a post-script in which, among other things, he points out that the modern-day Gypsies (Roma) have a better claim to be \\"Aryan\\" than northern Europeans.  Likewise, he debunks the silly notion that languages may be culturally superior or inferior to each other.  The subject of the Indo-Europeans is, of course, controversial and over the years an enormous amount of nonsense has been published on the subject.       The bulk on the book is devoted to looking at the evidence and attempting to locate the origin of the Indo-Europeans in time and space.  Mallory's conclusion is hardly new -- but it is well-reasoned. The proto-Indo-Europeans probably originated between 4500 and 2500 BC in an area roughly centered on the Russian city of Volgograd (Stalingrad).  From there they spread in all directions and their language evolved into the dozens of Indo-European tongues spoken today.  The author also evaluates alternative  theories of Indo-European origins along the way, especially Colin Renfrew's that the Indo-Europeans originated in Anatolia.    This is a book that the general reader can understand, but not without careful attention as the author introduces an enormous amount of material in coming up with his conclusions.  The topic is fascinating.  Where did those of us who speak English, Russian, French, Farsi, Hindi, Greek, Armenian, or many other languages come from at the dawn of history? Mallory expands the frontier of our knowledge with peeks at the lives of our ancestors 6,000 years ago.             Smallchief	2005-07-20

This is a turkey of a thriller. The plot is that Joel Backman, a former Washington wheeler-dealer, is pardoned from prison at the behest of the CIA so that he can be murdered by whichever assassins hate him most: Israelis, Chinese, or Saudis.  The CIA stashes Backman away in Bologna, Italy and waits for said assassins to find him, but Backman -- guess what? -- manages to escape and lead them all on a merry chase.  Whoopee!     The barest of plots is covered up by descriptions of fabulous Italian architecture, scintillating Italian coffee, sumptuous Italian food, elegant Italian fashions, intriguing Italian women, and endless lessons in how to speak Italian.  Methinks Grisham has a serious infatuation with Italy... and can hardly wait to show us his color slides and souvenirs.      Unless you're really desperate I wouldn't read this, but if you're really desperate you can skip over page after page without missing anything, including a climax that fizzles like overaged spumante.

Thereafter, the book gets a little too fact-laden and turgid, but it is still a worthwhile book to make your way through.  The author strives for, and mostly achieves, an objective account of the scientific and political controversies surrounding Robert Oppenheimer.    The book is good in that it gives recognition to Lawrence as a pioneering atomic energy physicist and assigns only secondary roles to Oppenheimer and Teller in the early part of the book.   The charismatic Oppenheimer, however, received the assignment of leading the team that built the first atomic bomb -- although General Leslie Groves, decidely uncharismatic, was really the man who managed the multi-faceted project and deserves at least equal credit with the scientists. Teller, also decidely uncharismatic, later managed the hydrogen bomb project and was a prominent voice in the scientific community until the 1980s.    The fascination of all the science is enhanced by Oppie's politics and the eventual denial of a security clearance for him to work for the U.S. government.  The author describes Oppie's many leftist and Communist friends and contacts -- as investigated by the FBI and military security -- in great detail.  In most accounts, Teller is the dastardly villain who declines to recommend Oppie for a renewal of his security clearance -- and Oppie forever after will be a hero to those who see this as a vast injustice.  I hardly think it was all that big a deal.  Oppie didn't go to jail, he didn't lose his job, he wasn't disgraced in the scientific community -- if anything his reputation and fame were enhanced.  All that happened to Oppie was that he was denied the opportunity to work on bigger and better bombs within the US government.      Teller, in one divergent view, was the man of conscience who expressed his view and willbe forever punished for it. While I would be surprised to learn that Oppie was a spy, rational people could certainly believe that he was a potential security threat; many of his closest associates and relatives were Communists and his past political behavior had been reckless for a man entrusted with the most sensitive secrets of the U.S. government. As the old saw goes, you are judged by the company you keep -- and nobody in his right mind would have shared atomic secrets with many of Oppie's friends. (The Teller vs Oppenheimer controversy will undoubtedly continue through the ages.)             If you like this book, you might also look at Richard Rhodes' two monumental volumes on the development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs.            Smallchief	2005-07-15

Surprise (Aubrey/Maturin Novels)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Maybe it'll grow on me	The third (of 20) in the Aubrey/Maturin series of the Napoleonic wars, this novel tells of a voyage to India by Captain Aubrey and his spying friend Dr. Maturin. Along the way, poorhouse refugee Aubrey looks for a rich French prize to ease his troubled finances and Maturin's mind is fixated on an inconstant woman he anticipates finding in Bombay.               This is the first of the Aubrey/Maturin seafaring books that I have read and I'm a bit equivocal. The character development is superb; the writing is excellent -- albeit obscure in places for this landlubber; humor, drama, and action dot the pages.  But my standard for naval adventure is the Hornblower series and I'm not yet ready to concede that Aubrey/Maturin is better. The narrative is hard to follow and the characters and incidents go by with blinding speed, leading me often to wonder: who (or what) was that? Reading the series from the beginning would help with the comprehensibility problem, so do that if possible.     Is Aubrey really more interesting than Hornblower? Maybe he's more endearing in his blundering incompetence in everything not connected to seamanship.  And what is Maturin about on this voyage?  You can't do much spying when you spend months and months at sea.  All in all, \\"H.M.S. Surprise\\" intrigued me.  I'm inspired to read another in the series to see if I can get into the characters and the story.  I can see the possibility that I might become an Aubrey/Maturin fanatic.  But I'm not there yet.

This is a worthy addition to the long shelf of good books about the doings of a few men who explored and adventured in the wilderness of the great West around about the 1820s and 1830s.  Never perhaps did so few lead such exhilarating and dangerous lives.       The \\"Reader\\" consists of 151 brief excerpts from mostly contemporary writings.

Thus, it was that \\"Stalking the Wild Asparagus\\" was a revelation to me when I first encountered it as a young man.  Somebody else in the world was interested in eating wild plants! Quite a few somebodies, it developed, because this book ran through a lot of printings and Euell Gibbons became a folk hero and TV star.  <br /> <br />Gibbons identifies and discusses the culinary virtues of about 50 different wild plants and animals.  Among the familiar plants he identifies are dandelions, cattails -- the \\"supermarket of the swamp\\" -- and daylilies.  He tosses in a few animals worthy of pursuit and ingestion by the modern day hunter/gatherer: bluegills, turtles, frogs, and carp.  One is immediately impressed that Gibbons knows what he is talking about.  He tells you what you need to do with the plant or animal, gives you a recipe or two for its preparation, and adds a bit of personal experience and folklore about the plant.  He even gives you menus for wild-food feasts.     <br /> <br />There is something of the primeval in the attraction of children to gathering their own food, even if is only raspberries growing beside a road.  For a few, such as Gibbons, it becomes a lifelong passion. His strength as a writer is infectious enthusiasm.  I usually find nature writers to be preachy and sanctimonious.  Gibbons isn't.  He seems impervious to the thought that he might be considered as crazy as a loon (not one of the animals he proposes for eating).  He can say with a perfectly straight face, \\"Let's go nutting.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Stalking the Wild Asparagus\\" has found a permanent place on my bookshelf and due recognition as a nature classic.  <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-07-10

The endless heat and humidity and the lack of variety in the weather is deadening to the spirit. So it was to the Western colonialists in Asia -- and even more so in the days before air conditioning.  They sought a refuge in the cool hills to escape the heat and the disease of the lowlands.  <br /> <br />Barbara Crossette writes of the hill stations to which the colonialists escaped.  Some of them are storied: Simla, the hot season capital of British India; Darjeeling with its tea plantations and marvelous view of Kachenjanga, the world's third highest and most scenic peak; the high, cool tea country of Ceylon; the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia; and Baguio, the American hill station in the Philippines. In all, the author describes briefly about 20 hill stations in eight countries.  <br /> <br />\\"Hill Stations\\" covers the history and the current atmosphere and flavor of the stations, based on her visits.  Most of the old Colonial watering holes have been taken over by local tourists rather than affluent foreign colonists --and ease of access and population pressure has made them tacky with high-rise development and \\"tourist\\" attractions.  But, all can be forgiven for the blessed relief the hill stations offer from the heat of the plains and the glory of their scenery.  Crossette has written an interesting book that may whet your appetite to visit and learn more about the hill stations.    <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-07-10

Eisenhower is a very competent historian who has written half a dozen outstanding books about war.  What he lacks in flash and dash he makes up for with clarity and an interesting sustained narrative.<br /><br />\\"Allies\\" is about the making of joint British/American strategy to defeat Germany in World War II.  It was not an easy relationship.  The Brits and the Yanks often disagreed on fundamental issues of how to fight the war.  The British regarded the American as rank unrealistic amateurs and the Americans were suspicious that they were being used to preserve the British empire.  The opening quote from Winston Churchill describes the relationship: \\"There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them.\\"<br /><br />\\"Allies\\" is enlivened by many ancedotes illustrating both the foibles and the virtues of the high and mighty in the two commands.  It was brought home to me the difficulty and dangers of traveling in those days -- even for prime ministers and commanding generals.<br /><br />The principal characters of the book are Churchill, Roosevelt, and Marshall and their staffs -- but Dwight David Eisenhower comes into his own during the book. He seems to have been the one man on both sides who could forge a workable military partnership and the book ends with his laconic decision to invade Europe, \\"OK, we'll go.\\"  (The author apologizes for his emphasis on his father -- but such emphasis seems justifed.)<br /><br />\\"Allies\\" was written more than 20 years ago, but is not out of date in any way that I can find.

This young American Indian had a fabulous sense of color and movement and his paintings are just plain beautiful.  Most of them have American Indian and Western themes.  You've seen many imitators if you've perused the galleries in Santa Fe.<br /><br />Tiger seems an overdue candidate for iconhood.  He was a full-blooded Indian from Oklahoma. He was uneducated, never finishing high school, and untrained, although he studied for a while at the Cooper Art School in Cleveland. He was a boxer and street fighter, a drinker, and, most importantly, he died young.  He was only 26 when he killed himself with a bullet -- apparently accidental -- to the head.  He was enormously, instinctively talented at his trade and blissfully ignorant.  He once asked, \\"Who was Michelangelo?\\"<br /><br />His wife and cousin compiled this illustrated biography.  It's well written, favorable to Tiger but not hagiographic.  The story of his life is interesting; the reproductions of his paintings and drawings are wonderful.  There is a drawing of James Dean done when Tiger was about 14 years old that is as good a representation of the \\"rebel without a cause\\" as I have seen.  There are photographs of Tiger in the boxing ring, and riding a horse, and with his daughter.  He was a handsome young man whose pompadour resembles James Dean's.<br /><br />Most of all there are reproductions of his paintings, more than 100 of them, most dominated by the beautiful blue he favored and featuring American Indians in all their activities. The impact of his large paintings cannot be appreciated on the printed page but they are stunning.  Tiger's output was enormous; he had a photographic memory and rarely erased.  He once drew a locomotive in all its details from memory.  He was a budding genius who, in my humble opinion, deserves to be in the first rank of American painters -- not in the first rank of American Indian painters, but in the first rank of American painters.

It's the story of a city woman living on a remote Maine river with her husband and children. She's not poor, nor a rube, nor does she display the eccentricities one associates with people who flee to the wilderness. Rather, she seems happy, well-adjusted, and full of sympathetic tales about the few -- very few -- people she comes into contact with in the course of her daily life. And she really did live in the woods --the nearest store was a long boat ride away and she didn't go \\"outside\\" for a four year stretch.  Her township of Upton had a population of 182.        The book is set up in chapters that answer questions:  \\"Isn't housekeeping difficult?\\" or \\"Aren't you ever frightened.\\"  One of the better stories in the chapter, \\"Aren't the Children a Problem\\" tells about her husband delivering the author's baby in the dead of winter -- and greasing it with olive oil which he kept to dress his trout flies. The new parents discuss what they are supposed to do with the hot water always called for when a baby is being born -- and they decide to make coffee.       For the modern reader, the highlights of the book are probably tales of the trials of living without conveniences.  The Rich houses -- they had a winter and summer house -- had no plumbing.  Heating and cooking were with wood.  What you needed for groceries was delivered by boat once a month; the Sears catalog supplied the rest.  For anyone who has ever thought wistfully of fleeing civilization, this is a humorous primer of both the rewards and hardships of such a life.  It deserves a permanent place on the short shelf of Americana classics.      Smallchief	2005-07-06

Certainly, Andrews led an exciting life.      Andrews was in the American mold of the self made man.  Born in a small town in Wisconsin, after college he got a humble job at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. From there he managed to work his way into becoming an expert on whales, which led him to the Far East and China.  In the 1920s and 1930s he led a series of expeditions in the Gobi to search for the earliest traces of mankind -- a theory of the day being that man originated in Asia.  He found little of ancient man, but demonstrating a typical ability to make the best of a situation he shifted his attention to dinosaurs and became famous for his discovery of dinosaur eggs and bones and his books. Then, in true Horatio Alger style, he became the Director of the same museum where 30 years before he had been a floorsweeper. (Well, not exactly a floorsweeper, but he tells us he would have swept the floor just to work there.) When I was a child in the 1950s, Andrews was famous, but he has slowly receded from public consciousness.       There's not much in this book about the man -- Andrews was apparently about as introspective as a rock -- but there is a lot about the fabulous adventures of Roy Chapman Andrews. He tells some cracking good tales about whale hunting in the north Pacific, tiger hunting in China, and bone hunting in the Gobi.  Some may be irritated by his macho, gee-whiz attitudes, but I like him.  He had grit and drive and formidable skills of organization, fund raising, and self promotion.  You could do worse than look up to Andrews as one of the most admirable men of the first half of the 20th century.    There's a biography of Andrews which is pretty good -- but why not read the man himself about his life?  This book is fast-paced, easy-reading, and full of exotic tales -- Indiana Jones in real life.      Smallchief	2005-07-05

Perhaps the battle for the island was upstaged by the simultaneous collapse of Nazi Germany and rendered anti-climatic because of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan shortly thereafter.  <br /> <br />Okinawa, however, was a battle that inspires superlatives.  It was the bloodiest battle in the Pacific for both Americans and Japanese; the American fleet for the invasion was the most powerful naval armada ever assembled; the kamakazi attacks of the Japanese led to the largest naval losses the US has ever suffered; the number of soldiers and civilians killed in the battle exceeded those killed by both atomic bombs dropped on Japan.          <br /> <br />This is one of the best books I have ever read on World War II.  There is less here of strategy and tactics and more of the personal experiences of American and Japanese soldiers at the sharp end of the stick and the unfortunate Okinawans, a \\"little\\" people killed in wholesale numbers by both their Japanese overlords and the American invaders.              <br /> <br />The author does an especially good job of examining the education and psychology of Japanese officers and soldiers and their incredibly naive faith that Japan would somehow prevail against the awesome American armada.  He explores the Japanese cult of death and their archaic beliefs that courage and military virtues could overcome American firepower. (As a practical American said, brave men and firepower will always defeat brave men.)  Most of all, the author paints a sympathetic picture of Okinawa and its peaceful people, one third of whom were killed in the battle.  <br /> <br />\\"Tennozan\\" has not received the recognition it deserves as a classic of warfare.  Perhaps this is because it is essentially an anti-war book that extols the courage of the fighting man -- but does not sugar-coat the atrocities committed by both Japanese and Americans.   Perhaps it is because the book takes a forthright view of the correctness of the American decision to drop the atomic bombs on Japan.  In my opinion, the author is fair-minded in all his conclusions and has turned out a magnificient work of art and history.           <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-07-03

It doesn't have the range or depth of several other more detailed analyses of the December 7, 1941 attack by Japanese airplanes on the American base in Hawaii.  The virtues of the book are the excellent large-format photographs, the maps, the drawings of Japanese aircraft and ships, and the computer- generated graphics showing the details of the battle.  <br /> <br />I am a fan of Willmott's two earlier books of Pacific World War II strategy, \\"The Barrier and the Javelin\\" and \\"Empires in the Balance.\\"  He has a way of picking apart military strategy, finding its flaws, and coming up with fresh conclusions which usually make sense.  Given that the American military disaster at Pearl Harbor has been examined to death, there's not much scope for originality, but Willmott's chapter on \\"Assessment and Aftermath\\" is interesting nevertheless.  His theme, repeated in all his books, is that Japanese strategy was hopelessly muddled and simplistic.   <br /> <br />You may find this to be more of a reference book rather than one to be read from cover to cover.  In addition to drawings and photos in the text, it contains additional detail in the appendices such as long lists of the aircraft, ships, and personnel involved in the carrier strike force of the Japanese, including the specifications of all Japanese ships and their ultimate fate.

This book comes closer to making clear to me some very complex issues than any other I have found. The authors start with the small --quantum mechanics, the Big Bang, and the time the universe was the size of a pinhead -- and proceed on to examine the big issues.          The approach of the book is chronological, from 14 billion years ago up to the present.  The first chapters deal with the creation of the universe.  From there attention moves to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets and, finally, the authors take a long look at the prospects of finding life somewhere out there.  Along the way, there is fascinating -- and occasionally humorous -- discussion on subjects such as whether the universe is finite or infinite, the techniques of finding unseen planets circling distant stars, and the conditions under which life might be created.  Theories, speculation, and facts are introduced that date from as recently as 2002 so this book should be current and readable for a few more years.       The text is illustrated by a sizeable number of good-quality color photographs and an extensive glossary explains a lot of terms and theories mentioned in the text.

The author tells the story of more than a dozen American women who were interned by the Japanese or took to the hills to escape being captives. Most of the Americans were residents of the Philippines, but one was interned in Borneo, another on Celebes and a third in Hong Kong.     The best known of the internees, Agnes Newton Keith,was a well known author before the war and wrote a chilling account, \\"Three Came Home,\\" of her three years in captivity.  Several of the other women also published their stories or were interviewed by the author.    I can't think of anything more frightening than to be stranded with your children ten thousand miles from home in wartime and being totally at the mercy of a cruel enemy.  Fortunately, the Japanese, for all their savagery in China, did not usually physically abuse the Caucasian women. However, hunger, isolation, and the fear of the unknown were potent factors.  Perhaps the most amazing part of this story is how well and effectively the women coped with their fate.      There is a bit too much of academia in the narrative.  The drama of the lives of the captives -- or those who evaded captivity -- could have been better exploited.  The thematic approach taken by the author involved much skipping around from woman to woman and made it difficult to become familiar with them individually.  But, the story is good and interesting, the research impeccable, and the book well worth reading by World War II buffs, feminists, and people interested in the impact of extreme stress on human beings.

This sequel describes his experiences from the end of World War II until 1947.      One suspects that this book was written primarily to capitalize on Shirer's earlier success.  There's too little of a diary here and too much of a anti-German diatribe and publication of Nazi documents -- many of which run on for page after page.  Shirer's extreme anti-German bias is irritating.  Anti-Nazi bias is understandable, but commenting vehemently on the ugliness of German women and men (page 149) is a bit much. Many other examples of his obvious dislike for all things German can be found.   Shirer's view appears to have been that no fate was too awful for the German people.         At the same time, Shirer displays enormous ability to forgive the Russians their sins.  He opines, for example, that Russian rapes of German women do \\"not appear to have been very excessive.\\"  This in the face of evidence that the Russian conquest of Berlin was an orgy of rape and plunder.    Moreover, Shirer abandons journalistic objectivity on other subjects.  He campaigns to have Spain excluded from the League of Nations -- hardly one of the most crucial issues the world faced in the aftermath of WW II -- but he has not a disparaging word for Russian actions in Germany, Greece, and Eastern Europe -- and makes no acknowledgement that the regimes the Russians were imposing there were hardly democratic or popular.        The good parts of the book are Shirer's personal descriptions of Berlin and his setting of the atmosphere in Germany and other European countries in the immediate post war era.

I liked \\"Sharpe's Tiger.\\"  It's easy to read, fast moving, authentic in detail, and describes a real historical event, apparently with a substantial degree of accuracy.  Cornwell knows his business, at least well enough to fool me.           The story revolves around the siege of Seringapatam in central India in 1799.  Sharpe is a 22-year old private in the army, unlettered, crude, and brutal -- but also quick thinking and a natural leader.  Reprieved from a flogging for misconduct, he is sent on a spy mission to Seringapatam to gather information about the defenses of the city before the British attack it.      Arthur Wellesley, the future Wellington, England's greatest soldier, is a character and is portrayed as cold as Lucifer.  In fact, perhaps the most memorable feature of the book is the picture it gives of the appalling conditions of servitude for British soldiers in 1799.  The French and the Indian Maharajahs, by contrast, are more humane in many respects.         I like to read series in their chronological order and I liked \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\" well enough to now proceed onward to the next in the series.  I suspect I will learn more about the Napoleonic Wars from the series than I have ever learned from history books.      Smallchief	2005-06-22

A desperate Lincoln calls Grant east from Vicksburg to stop the Confederate army and prevent a Union collapse and a southern victory in the Civil War. That's the premise of \\"Grant Comes East,\\" volume two in a trilogy of alternative histories by Newt Gingrich and Willam R. Forstchen.  It's a cracking good story.   <br /> <br />You should read the prequel \\"Gettysburg\\" if possible to become acquainted with the characters and Gingrich's and Forstchen's take on them.  However, the Civil War buffs who will be interested in this novel are probably already familiar with the main players, nearly all of whom are historical -- so plunge in if you wish.  G & F have made almost all the characters both plausible and attractive so neither Yankee nor Reb will be put out at the portrayal of his favorite Civil War hero.  Even Dan Sickles, the politician and Union General who is the villain of this novel, comes across as a pretty likeable guy.  Perhaps Gingrich can't conceal affection for a fellow politician. The authors are good wordsmiths and the novel is well-crafted.  <br /> <br />Alternative histories usually founder on what the reader perceives as implausibility, but G & F manage to keep it real.  To be sure, Longstreet becomes more like the fallen Stonewall Jackson than he was in real life and the notion that Lee would rely on Judah Benjamin as a spiritual advisor is far fetched, but nothing happens in the book that is too divorced from the possible.   <br /> <br />Gettysburg is the favorite topic of American armchair speculators and the number of books that have been written about the battle is enormous.  This trilogy is one of the best in describing how Lee might have won the battle and the aftermath of his victory. It's an inspiring bit of Americana with a patriotic message of sacrifice and struggle mixed in with well-drawn battle scenes.      <br /> <br />Smallchief  <br />	2005-06-20

Following in the footsteps of his father he took up residence on the frontier and made a hazardous living as a trapper, long hunter, surveyor and soldier. He became a militia captain in the War of 1812 and the Black Hawk war of 1832 and participated in early U.S. army explorations of the Great Plains.  His life was interesting and exciting and moderately important.      The author has turned out a well-written and researched scholarly biography of Boone.  I was impressed with his ability to make Boone and his family come alive and to string together a coherent narrative from many sources.  The book is an significant contribution to the history of the American frontier, especially for its insights about White relations with Indian tribes such as the Osage, Potawatomi, Sauk, Wichita, and Cherokee.  Boone was a competent, unspectacular exemplar of the American frontiersman on the Middle Border.     Those with an interest in the frontier history of Missouri and nearby states, especially the uneasy relationships between Whites and Indians will find this book worth reading.

The maps are much better in this edition.    <br /> <br />This Gold Rush, named after the Klondike River in the Yukon territory of Canada, was the last great scramble for gold in the old West. One hundred thousand persons, mostly from the U.S., set out for the Klondike in 1897, 30,000 or 40,000 got there, after an arduous journey through killing winter snows, and a few hundred found gold. The stories of the long, hard journey into this Arctic wilderness are often horrific. In one party of 19 men, 15 died or were killed along the route and the other four had eyes damaged by snow blindness. The gold seekers included author Jack London, Wyatt Earp, and poet Joaquin Miller. By late-summer 1899, \\"one of the weirdest and most useless mass movements in history\\" was over.  Most of the gold seekers went home to live normal lives, although a few moved on to the beaches of Nome, Alaska where gold could be picked up among the grains of sand.   <br /> <br />The author tells a compelling tale of the men and women who participated in the Klondike Gold Rush. It was indeed a fever. The characters in this book include crusty old miners who suddenly became rich beyond their wildest dreams, stalwart, incorruptible Canadian Mounties, conmen like Soapy Smith -- who in the dramatic tradition of the West receives his just deserts -- prostitutes, madams, gamblers, angels of mercy, last-chance losers, rich adventurers, Indians, and missionaries. It's a fascinating read, based on research that included interviews with many of the oldtimers who lived to talk to theauthor in the 1950s. The author's standard of truth telling is high; he identifies a tall tale or an unlikely exaggeration when he finds them.  <br /> <br />The text would be enhanced if there were photographs, but I doubt you'll find a better book about the Klondike Gold Rush.

The Powhatans are best known as the people who met the Jamestown colonists in 1607 and gave the world the story of Pocahantas, surely as romantic a tale as can be found anywhere.   <br /> <br />This is a typical academic book: 200 pages, unadorned,  overpriced.  Why couldn't books of this sort be published on the WWW to save paper?  The authors would get wider readership -- and the royalties they would lose from a book that barely makes the top million in Amazon sales would be miniscule. Although the material is stretched a bit thin, this is also a competent academic survey of the Powhatans.  I enjoyed the essay which described the Indians as long distance travelers by trail and boat.  Another essay discussed the biology of the Indians.  A chart detailing Indian mortality was illuminating.  The Powhatan had an average life expectancy of only about 22 years as 35 percent died before the age of 5.  Life had few long sunsets in those days -- for Indians or Whites.   <br /> <br />Other chapters discuss the Powhatan's relationship with the almost-unknown Siouan tribes of interior Virginia and other tribes of the Chesapeake Bay area plus contacts of the Powhatans with Spaniards and Englishmen.  A bit more speculation based on the impressive expertise of the authors would have been interesting -- but I guess that's not encouraged in scholarly papers.  <br /> <br />All in all, a good compilation of information that you should read if you're interested in Virginia at the time of contact and before the White conquest of the Indians.  <br /> <br />Smallchief          <br />	2005-06-02

It replaces Prescott's famous \\"Conquest of Peru,\\" a brilliant piece of research and writing but one compiled at a Boston desk from archival materials. Hemming has much more personal familiarity with the subject and a much greater range of sources to draw on.     How it was that conquistador Francisco Pizarro and less than 200 men were able to overthrow the Inca empire of 15 million subjects is one of the great tales of history.  \\"Conquest\\" details that struggle for power in convincing and fascinating detail, focusing on Pizarro and his brothers who were all brutal, deceitful, and courageous. Hemming gives almost equal time to the Incas and their leaders as they struggle against or accommodate themselves to Spanish rule.  (As will be evident to contemporary visitors to Cuzco and Andean Peru, the Spanish conquest never penetrated very deeply.  The Inca culture and language still live; Pizarro is despised by most Peruvians and the last Inca, Tupac Amaru, is a national hero.)        The story of the conquest has been romanticized in the classic play \\"Royal Hunt of the Sun\\" which is well worth seeing for its portraits of Pizarro and the Inca emperor Atahualpa. But the capture and murder of Atahualpa is only the beginning of the story.  What followed was a 40 year struggle between Inca and Spaniard (and among Spaniards) for control of Peru that ended with the beheading of Tupac Amaru.  The last chapter of the book moves into modern times as it describes the search for the lost Inca province of Vilcabamba and the discovery of Machu Pichu in the early 20th century. The mystery of the last Incas and their jungle retreats has fascinated writers and achaelogists until the present day -- as has the Inca empire, perhaps the most enigmatic of history.      \\"Conquest of the Incas\\" was published in 1970.  Were itto be revised today more emphasis would probably be placed on the role of smallpox epidemics that disrupted the Inca empire and made it ripe for conquest. But that's about the only deficiency I find in the book.  It's one of the best histories ever written -- so good that it has found few imitators.       Smallchief	2005-06-01

About every known crackpot idea -- except invaders from outer space -- is proposed in these pages: Hebrews in Tennesee, Japanese in Arizona and Ecuador, Chinese all over the place, European watchtowers in Boston, links between Finnish and Uto-Aztecan languages, etc.  If one half of these essays were true you would have needed traffic signals to prevent congestion of Asian and European ships heading toward the Americas hundreds of years before Columbus.        In addition, most of the essays are written in the most turgid style possible -- and to the non-specialists, e.g. yours truly, they may be incomprehensible.      \\"Across Before Columbus\\", however, has some virtues.  First of all, it is possible that one or two of the alleged contacts took place. Once in a while a bizarre notion turns out to be true.  I found the essays about language links between the Americas and Asia to be persuasive and I was introduced to the interesting speculation that corn (maize) conceivably found its way to India from the Americas before Columbus.      I also found it interesting and worthwhile for the editors to balance the arguments in the essays with some peer comments.  For example, in a concluding essay, John Sorenson says in essence that most of the other essays in the book are pure BS and \\"nearly every writer can be faulted for selective ignorance of vital data.\\"  In other words, the authors are either ignorant or dishonest -- or both. So read the book, to the extent that it is readable.  You'll encounter some interesting ideas, but be very cautious in believing any of them.    Smallchief	2005-05-31

The photos are excellent; Palin is amusing and informative. He is self effacing and likeable rather than being a movie star on tour.    <br /> <br />Palin and a film crew spent 99 days -- in several trips -- to travel nearly 10,000 miles in the Sahara.  Their trip starts in Gibraltar and continues in a big circle through Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Niger, Libya, Algeria, and back to Morocco.  The Sahara countries they missed are Egypt, Chad, and Sudan.  The book is in the form of a daily diary and Palin reports hilariously on the status of his bowels as well as the more touristic daily events.   <br /> <br />Ninety-nine days of travel in an area as large as the United States doesn't permit profound insights -- and Palin doesn't overreach. Examples of the highlights of the book include a section on Niger where for a few days Palin and his crew live in the desert by taking a camel caravan into the formidable Tenere region.  In Algeria he travels to the mountain refuge of a French missionary in the Hoggar, about where one would say is the exact center of the Sahara, and follows it with a visit to an oil field and its modern technology, green lawns, and technicians, Arab and foreign.  He gives a good description of obscure and unknown Western Sahara where reigns a tense cease fire between Morocco and the Polisario.   His attitude throughout is good-natured.                   <br /> <br />If you would like a quick tour of the Sahara, including the landscape, the people, the problems, the politics, and the economy, this is a good book.

That being said he's much too self absorbed -- and in \\"Jack Dempsey\\" he's just plain sloppy and repetitive. Kahn tells the story twice of Hemingway's challenge to Dempsey for a sparring match, he repeats Dempsey's claim to have a Jewish Great-Grandmother three times, he devotes a long section to Henry Ford's anti-semitism, although Ford had nothing to do with Dempsey, and he attacks President Warren Harding ad nauseum.  One would think he had something deeply personal against Harding. Moreover, he leaps around in space and time, making the narrative hard to follow.       Kahn's admiration for Dempsey is boundless.  Dempsey was kind to him when he was a young sportswriter. At the same time he throws mud at Harding for his extra-marital affairs, he excuses Dempsey for being a bit of a stud outside the ring as well as inside.     All the criticisms aside, about one half the book is excellent as Kahn writes about Dempsey's fights brilliantly. If he stuck to that this would be an outstanding book.

Davis makes it comprehensible by arranging his material in the form of questions and answers.  \\"Which galaxies are nearest the Milky Way?  Has anyone found a black hole yet?\\" etc.  Some of the questions and answers are bizarre: \\"Has anyone been abducted by aliens? What became of Einstein's brain?\\"  This trivializes the subject, but it also makes it easy to skip material which is not of interest.  There are also little quotes and cartoons and other readily digestible material.  \\"So where are they?\\" asked the Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi when colleagues speculated about the existence of space aliens -- one helluva good question in my opinion.       I also like a poem quoted in the book which goes:  \\"There is in space a small black hole -- Through which, say our astronomers,-- The whole d--n thing, the universe, -- must one day fall.  That will be all.\\" You get the idea: levity mixed with doses of hard information.         If you know absolutely nothing about outer space this book is a good place to begin; if you know a little bit, as I do, this book is still worth reading to fill in gaps in your knowledge and to see if this author explains the incomprehensible in a manner in which -- at long last -- you gain a small glimmer of understanding; if you know a lot about outer space and physics I wouldn't bother reading this book.

Ben Green's book \\"Horse Tradin'\\" will be enjoyed by about anyone from Texas or with an interest in cowboys and horses.  Green was born in 1912 and this book tells stories of his horse tradin' experiences as a boy and young man in the late 1920s and 1930s before the automobile made the profession of horse trader obsolete. Green was a bit more than the simple cowboy he portrays in this book.  Research into his life tells us that he was educated in Veterinary medicine at Cornell and in England, so he didn't spend all his time trying to make a buck by sharp trades.     One suspects that Green, like all good traders, stretches the truth a bit in some of these 20 stories, but there is an air of authenticity and affection for horses and cowboying that is hard to resist.  \\"I rode into Mineral Wells one day on a new dun horse with black mane and tail that weighed about eleven hundred pounds and had a nice way of carrying himself -- a six-year old, stylish enough...\\" Now that's a description of a man who knows his horses.  Green tells of his shenaningans as a trader, and also of the times that he was taken himself -- by a southern gentleman who sells him a blind horse and by an Indian in New Mexico who sold him wild horses tranquilized by \\"sleepy\\" grass to make them appear tame.        Green makes you long for a time gone by, capturing the feel of a cold Texas morning, the taste of \\"bachelor's grub\\" like beans, beef, and potatoes, and the virtues of \\"hard-twisted, ill-tempered, unbroke Mexican mules.\\"  Texans bought this book in vast numbers when it was first published and it deserves to be recalled as an outstanding bit of Western Americana.

(If you read Maillard's book, you will find that his modest and self-mocking attitude may not be too far from the truth -- although Fleming is certainly an outstanding writer and journalist.)       This is a cracking good story, more informative than it may seem, and charmingly told.  Of an acquaintance, Fleming says that he \\"had seen me act more than once at Oxford, but he was of a forgiving disposition and prepared to let bygones be bygones.\\"  And, the author to the contrary, it was an adventure.  Fleming and Maillard traversed some of the most unforgiving terrain in the world at a time in which banditry and political strife were rife.  Fleming describes vividly the Chinese, Tungans, Turkis, and Tibetans they meet, the impossibly remote oasis towns at the foot of the Himalayas, and the passage across 15,000 feet mountain passes into British India.   One of the more interesting elements of the book is the intrusion of modern politics into this narrative of exotic lands and unchanging people.   The pair encounter civil war, Russian soldiers and airplanes in Kashgar, and \\"Great Game\\" intrique.         I recommend you read this book with a good map at your side - or better yet buy a used copy of the original hardback edition which has a map and some good photos.      Smallchief	2005-05-04

Subtract 20 or 30 points from Mark Twain's IQ and you have Bill Bryson's \\"Lost Continent.\\"  It's funny at times, clever, vindictive, and mean-spirited in others, but it lacks the unique, eye-popping insights of a great comedy writer. Anybody with a sharp tongue and a sarcastic attitude could have written this book.  (Why, says the reviewer jealously, didn't I write this book and make a lot of money?)    \\"Lost Continent\\" is Bryson's description of his automobile journey of nearly 14,000 miles in a rented Chevette to 38 states and innumerable small towns. He missed a few important states -- Texas and Florida, for example, but he describes towns like Tupelo, Mississippi -- birthplace of you-know-who -- and gives it a bit of a thumbs-up for the quality of its strip mall. There's a few other positive moments in the book, but most of the time Bryson appears to be having a wretched time, pouring out his spite at endless waitresses in cheap roadside cafes which don't measure up to his standards of refinement and cuisine. This is irritating.  Bryson is an Iowan, for heaven's sake, and he should know that uppity behavior is looked down upon in middle America -- even if you live in England and write books. His description of his father and growing up in Iowa borders on being cruel.         Fortunately, Bryson seems to be honest about his own limitations and prejudices and that saves the book from being a elitist diatribe about the failings of the United States.  His positive experiences in a few places -- Savannah, the Grand Canyon, and Storm Lake, Iowa leavens the negative sufficiently to make the book readable and he ends on a high note.  You can zip through it in an hour or two while waiting for an airplane or a dentist.                                   Smallchief	2005-05-04

Born the son of a wealthy and prominent White trader and a beautiful Cheyenne woman in 1843, he was raised half-White and half-Cheyenne.  He was educated in the White man's world and served in the Confederate Army, but became a Cheyenne warrior when his tribe went to war with the United States, participating in 27 war parties. He later worked as an interpreter and a broker -- not always a good one -- between the Whites and the Cheyennes.  Perhaps his more important role came late in life when he served as an informant to the historians and ethnologists studying the Cheyennes.  That they are among the best documented, most admired and studied of all Indian tribes is largely attributable to Bent.<br /><br />The authors have done an outstanding job in compiling the story of George Bent.  This is a scholarly, well-researched, well-documented, book that is complex but reads easily and tells a fascinating tale of a man between two worlds and comfortable in neither.  The characters of Western legend appear in the book: Kit Carson, Wild Bill Hickock, George Custer, Phil Sheridan, and Buffalo Bill. Desperate forgotten battles between the Cheyennes and their White enemies are recalled and described. Perhaps the most interesting chapters of all describe the relationship between Bent and the scholars -- Hyde, Mooney, and Grinnell -- who used him as a resource to write their books.  Bent had a burning interest in assuring that the story of the Cheyenne was recorded and remembered. He succeeded.<br /><br />\\"Halfbreed\\" is a sad book as it describes the destruction by disease and war and massacre of a people and of Bent's own efforts to survive in a world that collapses around him.  I don't know of any other book that delves so deeply and movingly into the world of the halfbreed. Bent deserves the recognition this book accords him almost a century after his death on the Cheyenne Reservation in Oklahoma.<br /><br />Smallchief	2005-05-02

Hotels and restaurants are described in helpful and interesting detail.  The guide covers not only Santa Fe but also a good sized chunk of surrounding territory, including Taos, smaller and even more literary and artistic than Santa Fe; the atomic city of Los Alamos; scenic, old Hispanic mountain towns; and even Chaco Canyon, the prehistoric ruin hidden in the desert now inhabited by the Navajo.       <br /> <br />Nearby Albuquerque, however, is not covered in the book -- an omission that probably should be remedied as Albuquerque has attractions of its own -- excellent museums and a walk through the bosques of the Rio Grande, for example. Nor did I find directions to the grave of author D.H. Lawrence near Taos so I made my way there unguided. Another criticism is that the author's brief essays about Chaco Canyon and Taos' most famous resident, Kit Carson, were eccentric and perhaps not to the point.         <br /> <br />The Indian/Hispanic/Anglo culture of New Mexico is probably the most unique and colorful regional culture of the United States and is celebrated in enough art galleries and literature to last a lifetime. My favorite places to visit: a tie between the Bradbury Museum of Science in Los Alamos, which has a mock-up of the first atomic bomb, and remote Chaco Canyon.  All in all, this is an attractive and reliable guide to the attractions of Santa Fe and its region.       <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-04-27

That could be as dull as a textbook, but the authors enliven \\"Sahara\\" with folklore tales, personal travel ancedotes, and fascinating little facts.  The desert is \\"as rich in story, as the Tuareg say, as a (...) is of milk.\\"         \\"Sahara\\" is divided into two parts.  The first deals with \\"the place itself\\" and the second with \\"the people.\\"  The most interesting chapter is, of course, the one dealing with water -- the constant preoccupation of anyone who travels in the Sahara.  And one of the fascinating little facts in this chapter is a story about the blind, edible fish that live in some wells in the desert. A fish dinner in the Sahara! That's worthy of Ripley's \\"Believe it or Not.\\"  Other ancedotes tell about the crocodiles that inhabited the one running stream of the deep Sahara and an actual waterfall in the Air Massif.        The Sahara is one of the most austere environments on earth and the most accomplished of the Sahara-dwellers are the romantic, blue-robed nomadic Tuareg who penetrate the deep desert in search of grazing for their animals, salt, and loot.  Tuareg lore is a large and interesting part of the book.  How they make their way unerringly across the constantly-changing dune fields and featureless rocky flats of the desert and find a single well in an infinity of wasteland remains, however, a mystery to the authors and the readers.             The few black and white photos in the book are too small to be of much consequence and maps are similarly small and unsatisfying, but the text is colorful and the story is fascinating.  \\"Sahara\\" rises above the level of the travelogue to become a natural history of the Sahara. If you like to read about lonely places and the few people who inhabit them, this is an excellent book.                        Smallchief	2005-04-27

The editor contributes an introduction and the well-known Indian scholar Vine Deloria, Jr. adds an afterword.      The book is attractive and its premise is superb: to describe the American Indians before their traditional life and culture were destroyed by the Europeans.  But the book is not quite as good as it should be. The subject, ranging over two continents, is too broad to be covered adequately in one volume.  The contributors are mostly anthropologists and the breadth of their vision is often restricted.  Political correctness creeps into some essays.  A description of the Aztecs trips quickly over the gory subject of human sacrifice -- widely practiced by the Aztecs and a central theme of their religion.      Moreover, the approach of most writers is anthropological and  historical information is mostly ignored. Within 50 years of 1492, the Spanish and other explorers encountered Indians from Newfoundland to Tierra del Fuego and their eye-witness accounts, however brief and biased, are invaluable.  The integration of these early historic accounts with anthropological information would result in much more vivid and realistic descriptions of the Indians in 1492.  Alas, many of the authors rely on their own anthropologicial speciality, ignoring the eye-witness accounts of Cabeza de Vaca and the expeditions of De Soto and Coronado, among others, which could add materially to the validity of their accounts.        Finally, there is the afterword by DeLoria, the author of the best-selling, \\"Custer Died For Your Sins.\\"  In a thoughtful, interesting, but rambling essay, DeLoria introduces some fantastic notions.  An inscription in Tennessee, he says, is written in ancient Hebrew -- thereby reviving the old (and ridiculous) theory that the Indians are descendants of the ten lost tribes of Israel.  And, he proceeds onward to describe an Indian pictograph of a dinosaur, suggesting apparently that dinosaurs and American Indians co-existed!  Without further explanation, such startling assertions do not belong in a book purporting to be factual.     I don't want to leave the impression that this is a bad book.  It's not -- many of the essays are interesting and worth reading -- but a better book could be written or compiled on such a fascinating subject.     Smallchief	2005-04-24

To the archaeologists Richard Wetherill is a villain -- an uneducated cowboy who plundered the ruins of the pre-historic civilization of the Southwestern Indians.  Author McNitt takes the opposite tact, portraying Wetherill as an upright honest man whose accomplishments, the first scientific examinations of the great ruins at Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon, far outweigh his faults. Adding to the enigma of Wetherill is the matter of his death --  murdered in cold blood by a Navajo Indian debtor according to this author, the loser in a gunfight caused by his own cattle rustling according to others.  Wetherill inspired strong passions in both life and death.     This is a fine biography.  The first few chapters may be hard slogging as the book goes through Wetherill's early life, but the chapters of Wetherill's life and work at Chaco Canyon leading up to his death in 1910 are fascinating.  The author follows up the shooting of Wetherill with a full description of the trial of his killer and the aftermath of his death.  This is a Western tale worthy of an epic movie and one has to wonder why it has not attracted Hollywood's attention.                                  McNitt makes a persuasive case that Wetherill's reputation was the victim of ambitious Eastern academics, jealous of his discoveries, and government Indian agents, jealous of his influence among the Navajo. I was impressed at how little dated were his descriptions of the ancient civilizations of the Anasazi, although the book was written in 1957.      Was Wetherill a hero or a villain?  The controversy about his character makes for a fascinating read.         Smallchief	2005-04-24

The first of the volumes, \\"The Northern Voyages,\\" is probably of more interest to North Americans, delving as it does into the Vikings and speculative pre-Columbian discoveries of America.<br /><br />\\"The Southern Voyages\\" begins with Columbus, covering his four voyages in about 200 pages, proceeds onward to Magellan and his circumnavigation of the globe, \\"the most remarkable voyage in recorded history,\\" and finishes with the English voyages of Sir Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish.  Along the way, Morison also discusses the voyages of many \\"minor\\" explorers including the enigmatic Amerigo Vespucci, a man of modest accomplishments who saw his name applied to two continents. Sebastian Cabot rates a chapter as does the Dutch discovery of Cape Horn and the French and Portuguese in Brazil.<br /><br />Morison was a sailor himself, a student of the sea, a naval historian, a biographer of Columbus, and a fine storyteller.  He brings a wealth of insight to the voyages and even undertook expeditions of his own to visit the places where the voyagers called. His admiration for Columbus' seamanship is unbounded.  \\"Never was a title more justly bestowed than...Admiral of the Ocean Sea.\\"  This admiration is a bit old-fashioned today, as latter-day historians talk more about Columbus's faults on land than his skill at sea.  Morison follows each chapter in his book with notes and a bibliography in which he discusses, often with some humor, the controversies, old maps, and speculations so beloved by armchair theorists and explorers.  Numerous photographs and outstanding maps dot the text.<br /><br />To my mind any reading about the European discoverers of America should begin with Morison's two volumes -- and it can end there in most cases unless the reader's thirst for knowledge is unquenchable.  This is an outstanding book and nothing comparable has beenwritten to my knowledge since its publication 30 years ago.<br /><br />Smallchief	2005-04-11

The Editor received a Pulitzer Prize for his work.     <br /> <br />The diary (actually much of it was written or elaborated nearly twenty years later) begins on February 16, 1861 at the time of the secession of the Southern states from the Union and ends abruptly on July 26, 1865 after the surrender of the Southern armies.  Mrs. Chesnut, the friend of Southern leaders such as Jefferson Davis, spent most of the war years in Richmond and her plantation home in South Carolina.    <br /> <br />Mary Chesnut purveys gossip among the elite and offers sharply worded opinions about the South, its leaders, negroes, and slavery. On page 71, we see for example that Robert E. Lee is being called a traitor by some people after his early military failures. Of Gen. Joe Johnston she says, \\"Being such a good hater, it is a pity he had not elected to hate somebody else than the president of our country.\\"  An outspoken woman of about 40 with a goodly share of self esteem Mrs Chesnut does not spare her husband -- who she despises -- and acquaintances from her worldly opinions. With passages on virtually every aspect of day to day living as well as the rush of events leading the downfall of the South, the diary of Mary Chesnut may be the best single source about life in the South during the Civil War.       <br /> <br />The most vivid passages in the diary are about the end of the war when the fashionable Mrs. Chesnut feels the pinch of poverty and despair as the Yankee armies conquer South Carolina and burn down her plantation home.  She captures the fear of Southerners, \\"as of a Bengal tiger in the home\\" of the Yankees and of the newly-freed negroes.  \\"The weight that hangs upon our eyelids -- is of lead\\"       <br /> <br />I haven't read this book cover to cover. I pick it up occasionally and randomlyread a few pages or look up the entry for a event of interest.  There is sufficient material to spend weeks reading and puzzling out the meaning of elliptical statements or distant relationships or obscure references.  The Editor has done a splendid job identifying in notes nearly all of the people Ms. Chesnut mentions and in clarifying the events to which she refers. This is a book you might choose to take to a desert island as it is nearly unconquerable as well as fascinating.   <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-04-10

Hedin was born in 1865 and this autobiography describes his life up until 1908.  Hedin's career was hardly finished, however, as he continued to traipse down the old Silk Road in Central Asia until the 1930s when he was 70 years old.     In a happy trait that should be copied by more auto-biographers, Hedin doesn't spend much time on his childhood.  By the third page of his narrative he is 20 years old and off to the Caucasus Mountains which only whets his appetite for the little-known peaks and deserts of Tibet and Central Asia.  He spent the years between 1893 and 1908 exploring these regions and filling in blank places on the map.             National Geographic's \\"Traveler\\" magazine put this book on its list of 100 best adventure books and, truly, the tales of Hedin's adventures make for good, exciting reading.  Hedin displays both charm and generosity in his account.  He traveled without the company of other Europeans and he enjoyed the companionship of his local helpers and the dogs he adopted along his way.  He draws many clever portraits of the people he met in his travels.  Hedin, however, was no mere adventurer.  He was a serious, sober scholar who produced dozens of scientific studies of his findings.       One of the most hair raising tales in the book concerns Hedin's  first expedition into the sands of the Takla Makhan (desert) of China in which he and his companions nearly died of thirst.  A second high point of the book is the account of his attempt to visit Lhasa, the forbidden capital of Tibet.  He failed after getting nearly to the gates of the city and was denied the honor of becoming the first foreigner to visit Lhasa in half a century.  Amidst the plethora of adventures, the stoic Swede brushes over incidents others would consider high -- or low -- points of their lives. \\"Fever kept me in Kashgar a long while\\" is his complete description of one serious illness.              The book is illustrated with many of Hedin's drawings, including his hand drawn maps.  I suggest that you read the book with a good modern map at hand so as to trace his routes with more precision as his constant tooing-and-froing can be confusing.      Smallchief	2005-04-09

This can be a bit dry given the multiplicity of travelers and their trips. <br /> <br />The book hits its stride with Chapter 6 and the description of the emigrants traveling over the trail in the 1840s and 1850s.  The author quotes extensively from the accounts of the emigrants themselves. The most touching of the stories is the two-page account of Catherine Sager of the death of her mother and father along the trail.  Later in the book we encounter Catherine as a captive of the Cayuse Indians.  I am inspired now to seek out Catherine Sager's book and read her full story.  <br /> <br />In the final chapter, \\"Rebirth of the Trail,\\" the author tells the fascinating story of Ezra Meeker who traveled the trail in 1852 and decided to retrace his path in 1900 at age 77.  Meeker's epic covered wagon re-voyage excited interest in the old trail and created a movement to preserve portions of the route, some of it still marked with the wagon wheel ruts of the emigrants.   <br /> <br />The book is well illustrated with photographs, maps, and art. Appendices describe related trails, historical landmarks, and there is even a glossary of 19th century words and phrases that might not be familiar to a modern reader.  This is an excellent and attractive book for the general reader.  <br /> <br />Smallchief   <br/> <br />      <br />	2005-04-05

As the editors point out few women made the crossing by land and thus their accounts have great significance.  This book contains the diaries and letters of six women who traveled by wagon and horseback across the Great Plains and the mountains of the West to a new home in California, Oregon, Utah, and New Mexico in 1850.  Amongst their descriptions of terror and hardship are also homely tales of life on the trail and often the generosity and nobility of many of their fellows.                 I was impressed most by the sheer numbers of the overlanders. Some 50,000 people took the Western trails in 1850, drawn mostly by the promise of gold in California.  Accounts of the dust, the crowded conditions, and the inevitable cholera caught my attention. The journey across the plains and mountains was, as the editors note, the longest voluntary migration in history and one has to wonder why so many people left comfortable homes to journey west.  The westward urge -- \\"Manifest Destiny\\" -- or whatever it might be called was a powerful force in 19th century United States. Indians and buffalo play surprisingly small roles in the accounts of the crossing.  They were perhaps wise enough to keep their distance from the overlanders.       The editors have contributed good introductions to the book and each of the women.              Smallchief	2005-04-04

What did Bernal actually claim?         (1) Classical Greek civilization was heavily influenced by Egyptian and, to a lesser extent, by Semitic civilizations.         (2) Scholars for the last 200 years have denied the African and Asian influence on the Greeks for racist reasons.    I don't find either of those assertions explosive -- in fact they seem quite reasonable and Bernal presented enough evidence to persuade me that he was making a plausible case. To be sure, Bernal made some agitating comments, such as the title of his book \\"Black Athena,\\" and gave extreme Afro-centrists ammunition for their arguments.  But I don't really see what all the fuss is about.       This book has a number of essays which cast doubt, one way or another, on Bernal's assertions.

In \\"Shanghai Station\\" he shifts locales to China and writes a book that is more of a conventional adventure tale.     Young Alexander Karlov is one of many White Russians fleeing the Communists after World War I and the Bolshevik revolution.  Fate leads him to Shanghai, where he meets an intiguing combination of Chinese gangsters and (...), European degenerates, American missionaries, and Russian revolutionaries.  He hunts -- and is in turn hunted by -- the Bolshevik responsible for the death of his mother and the kidnapping of his sister. Bull does an excellent job of creating the atmosphere of what was one of the most fascinating and mysterious cities of the era.  I would have given this book five stars had it probed a bit deeper into Shanghai and the revolutionary currents sweeping China after World War I. (The best novel about China of this period is probably \\"The Call\\" by John Hersey which is about an American missionary.)             Bull is a better than average writer and he gets the facts right about the exotic places about which he writes. This novel and Bull's earlier novels about Africa are fast-paced exciting reads.         Smallchief	2005-03-31

II: Eminent Historians Imagine What Might Have Been	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Interesting, uneven, but worth reading	Speculation about what might have happened -- instead of what happened -- is endlessly fascinating and the editor has brought together twenty-five people, mostly historians, to use their informed imaginations about important events.  The essays vary in quality from very good to fair -- the least interesting telling us more about what did happen than what might have happened.     <br /> <br />A moderately mind-bending essay is \\"Pontius Pilate Spares Jesus: Christianity without the Crucifixion.\\"  The best essay in the book is \\"No bomb, no end\\" a persuasive speculation on how World War II would have ended if the US had not dropped an atomic bomb on Japan. One of the most interesting is \\"The Boys Who Saved Australia, 1942,\\" the  tale of a few Australian soldiers stopping the all victorious Japanese army on New Guinea early in WW II.  This was an event, obscure to Americans, the importance of which I had never fully recognized.  <br /> <br />A lot of authors seem to loose their nerve and their conclusions are weak and tentative. Perhaps science fiction writers rather than historians would present bolder and more imaginative scenarios.  However, the historians all presented plausible scenarios for the future, and thus lived up their craft.     <br /> <br />Does history really hinge on the flip of a coin or \\"the want of a nail?\\" I think it often does, especially in war, in which the luck of the draw or a few determined people -- sometimes only one -- can make a difference that reverberates down through the centuries. We are all leaves blown by the wind. This kind of book is worth reading to open up your mind to the way things might have been.     <br /> <br />Smallchief       <br />	2005-03-27

The police team of Kathy Kolla and David Brock investigate the murder which seems to be connected to a mysterious research institute and the Islamic community of London.  <br /> <br />I couldn't quite get into this book.  I should have read earlier books in the series first to understand better the personalities of the main characters and also to comprehend references to events past that I wasn't familar with. Also, the book was written before 9/ll, but published afterwards.  It might have been very original when written but after 9/ll it becomes one of many, many books about Muslims in Western society. The book seemed already dated and overtaken by events. Finally, I didn't really find the solution to the mystery to be very believable.   <br /> <br />On the positive side, the book is competently written and a fair amount of tension and interest is built up in the narrative.  The author is a better than average writer and it's quite possible that other books in the series are better.  This one just didn't do it for me.  <br /> <br />Smallchief  <br /> <br />	2005-03-25

The author, Surgeon General Gordon of the British army in India, dryly records his experiences and compiles a large number of facts he collected about the country during an official reconnaisance mission.     <br /> <br />Much of this book could only be of interest to a specialist as the author lists, among other things, species of forest trees and palms, poisonous snakes, sea shells, and fish of Burma, dissertates on the economy and finances of the country, its government and its history. All in all, it's more of an encyclopedia than a travel book. I give the book 4 stars because it includes a day-to-day account of the author's travels in Burma, many good illustrations, drawings, and photographs, ethnological information on the hill tribes, and notes on the remote parts of the country -- most of which are still pretty unknown and inaccessible.      <br /> <br />The general reader will have little interest in the book, but people like me with an unquenchable desire to plow through old books about exotic places and enjoy the observations of long-dead and obscure writers will find at least some parts of the book to be interesting.     <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-03-21

The author starts with the forerunners of the modern day buffalo, about 10,000 years ago, and works his way up to the present.  Along the way he has chapters about the Indians and their use of the buffalo, the slaughter of the buffalo for its hides in the 1870s, and the rescue of the buffalo from extinction.  He draws his material from an enormous number of sources, interspersing eye-witness acounts of the buffalo with scholarly observations. Several dozen photos, some of them historical, enhance the narrative.   <br /> <br />The most interesting material in the book is the story of the buffalo's salvation from extinction.  One authority estimated that 75 million buffalo lived in North America before the white man arrived, but only 800 buffalo survived in 1895. That small group has grown to a present population of about 100,000.  The story of saving the buffalo tells of Eastern idealists and Western ranchers with characters like \\"Prairie Dog\\" Morrow, Charles Goodnight, and \\"Buffalo\\" Jones playing important roles.   <br /> <br />This is a fine book of Western Americana and natural history which even includes a mini-cookbook for buffalo meat in an appendix.   <br /> <br />Smallchief  <br /> <br />	2005-03-21

Hundreds of exquisite photographs of Indian pottery and other pre-historic artifacts, plus maps, drawings, and paintings illustrate the text.     The illustrations accompany about 20 essays on the Indians of southern and midwestern United States from archaic times until contact with Europeans.  The essays vary in quality and interest, but most are well written in scholarly but accessible prose.  The contributors include anthropologists, art historians, folklorists, and members of several Indian tribes. Footnotes and a substantial bibliography round out a scholarly and artistic book of real merit.     Throughout the book the continuity of ancient Indian cultures with those known to the Europeans is emphasized.  One of the most interesting essays concerns the people of Cahokia, the largest Northamerican archaelogical site dating from about 1200 AD, in which the author speculates about the identity of the inhabitants, relating them to present day Indian tribes.  Other essays concern the Bread Dance of the Shawnee Indians -- written by a Shawnee -- and the cultural continuity from pre-historic to present day Caddo Indians.

Well, there's a reason for that.  Bangladesh is hardly a tourist paradise.   <br /> <br />Dhaka is probably the most crowded city in the world and, in fact, the biggest attraction of the city is the traffic -- which is horrendous. The numbers of rickshas is astonishing; they line up eight-across on some streets all jockeying for position with three-wheelers, cars, trucks, buses, hand-pulled carts, and the occasional herd of goats. Dhaka is worth visiting just for a ricksha ride and traffic jams that are simply unbelievable.   <br /> <br />The country is pretty outside Dhaka: emerald green rice paddies, palm trees, and innumerable little villages.  The city of Cox's Bazaar is the honeymooner's capital of Bangladesh.  The beach here is advertised as the longest and widest in the world.  What interested me was the fact that of thousands of people on the beach only a few boys were actually in bathing attire and in the water. Women may dip their toes in the surf but they don't dress for the occasion.  The all-covering Shawar Camise with head-scarf is de riguer as female beachware -- as it is for everyplace else.  <br /> <br />Despite a lack of major attractions, Bangladesh is not a bad place to visit and you won't encounter crowds of foreign tourists.  Maybe you won't encounter any.  \\"Lonely Planet\\" covers the country in good detail including history, culture, current politics, sidebars about interesting trivia, places to stay and eat, and books you might want to read.

One problem, however, is that Malaysia and Singapore are hardly \\"lonely\\" in the sense of being out of the way, remote places.  The Kuala Lumpur skyline may be the most impressive in the world. Malaysia claims that the Petronas Towers are the tallest buildings in the world.  Singapore is simply the best run city in the world.      This is by way of warning that I wouldn't put too much stock in the \\"Lonely Planet's\\" recommendations on hotels and restaurants in tourist-heavy places like KL and Singapore. For example, I went to three restaurants \\"Lonely Planet\\" recommended in KL.  One was closed; one was awful; one was a notorious tourist trap.  My hotel, the Corus, wasn't mentioned in \\"Lonely Planet\\" but was a bargain at $49 per night (booked on the internet) just down the street from the Petronas Towers. (Should it be mentioned in the next edition of \\"Lonely Planet\\", the price will go up.) The guidebook also waxes lyrical about the delights of Singapore Airport.  I thought it was crowded and unremarkable.  Now, KL's airport is really special...    All this to emphasize that you shouldn't depend on the \\"Lonely Planet\\" for hotel and restaurant recommendations in big cities.  The strength of the guidebook is the detail it gives you about the countries -- their historical and cultural background, the practical emphasis on how to get from one place to another, descriptions of the small out of the way places you might miss otherwise, the sidebars that tell interesting tales.         \\"Lonely Planet\\" has become perhaps the best known of all travel guidebook series.

He feels the need to express himself occasionally about moral issues and the lack of civilized values of the Indians, Mexicans, and other prairie dwellers - but his condemnations are rote rather than persuasive. Garrard, we imagine, probably shared buffalo robes with comely young Cheyenne women and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, as he did buffalo hunting, dog-meat feasts, and tall tale sessions with the mountain men.

Scott and his four companions died on the return from the Pole, but left journals that told of their ardous journey right up to the end.  Scott lost the race to the Pole to Norwegian explorer Raoud Amundson who beat him by a month but in death Scott became a great English hero nevertheless.       Preston's book is not as good as two others about the expedition.  Apsley Cherry-Garrard was with Scott for the expedition, but did not accompany Scott to the Pole.  His account, \\"The Worst Journey in the World\\" is a classic of travel adventure.  Roland Huntford's, \\"The Last Place on Earth\\" is a blistering attack on Scott's competence and character along with a favorable account of Amundson.     Was Scott incompetent?  Well, Amundson made the 1400 mile plus trek to the Pole and back from his base camp in 99 days, averaging about 15 miles per day.  Scott averaged less than 10 miles a day, the short Antarctic summer ended, the weather got worse, and he and his companions died.  Amundson made good use of skis and dogs; Scott relied on man-hauling his supplies.  The British apparently loved Scott in death because of his amateurism, rather than in spite of it. A timely and tragic death can be enhancing to one's reputation.       Preston is generous with Scott and tells a touching story of Scott's relationship with his ambitious and independent wife.

It's also one of the most diverse with terrain from semi-desert at 4,800 feet up to sub-alpine spruce, fir, and aspen forest at a top of 10,892 feet.  The Gila River is floatable during the spring melt and old Indian cliff dwellings are found in the canyons. Trout fishing in the Gila and its tributaries is pretty good, and wildlife is abundant. Hiking and solitude are the major attractions. You can walk for a week or more and never cross your path twice.  The scenery may not be quite as rugged and spectacular as the Rockies or the canyonlands to the north, but there's plenty of beauty to be enjoyed.     This is an excellent guide to hiking in the Gila Wilderness Area. The author describes 25 hiking trails and routes, some of them more than 30 miles long.  Each of the trails has a topo map that goes along with it plus a description. A lengthy introduction acquaints you with the history and natural history of the Gila, including the Apaches and other Indians who lived here.  Appendices provide lists of birds, plants, mammals, and reptiles found in the Gila.  An interesting study concerning the reintroduction of the Grizzly Bear to the Gila is reprinted in the appendices.          Possibly the most spectacular of the trails in the Gila is the Whitewater Trail which follows a narrow \\"catwalk\\" through a steep sided canyon.  The catwalk was built more than a century ago to facilitate mining operations -- now long abandoned.  The Three Forks area (Wilderness Ranger District) offers hot springs, cliff dwellings, and long, easy trails that lead into the heart of the wilderness. At lower elevations, the Gila can be visited and hiked year round, barring the rare snowstorm.              Smallchief	2005-02-10

The range and quality of the author's writing make it a fascinating book that holds the reader's interest throughout 400 pages. This is popular science and adventure writing at its best.        Murchie builds his story around a single flight from the U.S. to Europe of a commercial airliner in the early 1950s.  He was the navigator on the flight and he describes how he determines the aircraft's speed and direction and pinpoints his location. (He speaks of his \\"computer\\" which in reality was a wooden slide rule. \\"Song of the Sky\\" was published in 1954 when navigation was still a paper and pen affair.)      Chapter one leads with the dramatic story of an ice build up on the wings of his airplane which threatens to cause it to stall and crash.  Murchie then broadens out his subject to give a fascinating history of navigation through the ages, including a lot of attention to Pacific Islanders who navigated over thousands of miles of empty oceans by charting and remembering patterns in ocean waves and currents. He describes weather and storms and their impact on flying and includes a lot of tales of flying adventures and misadventures to illustrate his points.       \\"Song of the Sky\\" was published 50 years ago and so the reader may expect to find a few anachronisms -- but very few. The heart of the book is sound.  This is one of the most exciting and informative books I have ever read and it has a permanent place on my bookshelf.

He was a mail carrier in Europe, South America and the Sahara in the days when a pilot got his weather report by looking at the sky and found an airport by looking out the window. Flying in those days was truly a adventure and Saint-Exupery tells some exciting tales of storms in Patagonia and a crash in the desert of Libya.  All of this is invested with metaphysical musings which would be mundane if he were not such a good writer. <br /> <br />Saint-Exupery disappeared during World War II while flying a reconnaissance mission over the Mediterranean.  The wreckage of his plane was found in the sea near the southern coast of France in 1983.  <br /> <br />As an alternative -- and more informative -- read to \\"Wind, Sand and Stars\\" I like Guy Murchie's \\"Song of the Sky.\\"    <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-02-10

(Ernest Hemingway's novel, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is another.) The Spanish Civil War was an intensely ideological conflict between Right and Left and adherents of both sides told outrageous lies in pursuit of victory. Orwell was of the Left but he still saw the war clearly and wrote about what he saw without adornment.  <br /> <br />In \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" Orwell tells the story of his seven months as a volunteer soldier with the Loyalists fighting against the Fascists in 1936-1937. The first half of the book is about his life as a common soldier on the front lines near Barcelona. It is unvarnished and unheroic and often amusing. In the second half of the book he describes the chaotic events in Barcelona when the Loyalist factions, especially the Anarchists and Communists, fought pitched battles against each either and pretty much ignored their common enemy, the Fascists of General Franco. Orwell himself ended up fleeing Spain to avoid being arrested by the people he had come to Spain to help.  <br /> <br />Orwell makes clear that his sympathies are with the Anarchists who favor the creation of an equalitarian worker's government. He was appalled by the evil and incompetence he saw and his experience in Spain probably contributed greatly to his later cautionary novels \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm.\\"  If you want to learn about the Spanish Civil War, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is the first book to read.  You will get a high standard of truth that you can use to judge other works.   <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-02-09

Three years later a single ship, the \\"Victoria,\\" limped back with only 21 aboard, Magellan not among them.  This ship and its starving crew were the first to go around the world.  The cloves carried in Victoria's hold were enough to ensure a profit for the whole voyage despite the loss of four ships and more than 200 men.     This is a competent book about Magellan's voyage of discovery.  It lacks the enthusiastic brilliance and the love of ships and the sea of Samuel Eliot Morison (\\"The Southern Voyages\\") but makes up for that with its thoroughness about Magellan and the voyage.  One does not shed any tears for the fate of Magellan and his men.  The best parts of the book are about the people the Spanish and Portuguese explorers encountered in South America and the East Indies who seemed far more civilized than did the Europeans.             However, publishers issuing books without adequate maps should be tarred and feathered.  There is not even a map of the Straits of Magellan, named in honor of the explorer who was the first European to traverse their treacherous waters.  I would have liked to know more about how Magellan knew the Straits were down there.  The author also takes some tiresome excursions into Shakespeare's \\"Tempest\\" and other topics when I would have preferred for him to stick to the subject of the voyage.    Quibbles aside this is a worthwhile book to read and probably is the best available on Ferdinand Magellan, his life and his extraordinary voyage of discovery.       Smallchief	2005-02-07

Don't get me wrong.  I like books that shake and rattle the academic establishment -- but you gotta be at least moderately credible and get most of your facts right.  Menzies fails on both counts, although he's pretty good at covering up his astounding claims with a patina of scientific language.      Menzies thesis is that the Chinese sailed around the world in 1421 and on side jaunts discovered Antarctica, the North Pole, circumnavigated Greenland (!!), and left colonies all over the Americas including building stone towers near Boston.  Moreover, the Chinese sailed around the world in only a couple of years.  Oddly, the Chinese seem to have missed Europe where their visit would surely have been remembered and recorded.      As in all good cons, there's a grain of truth in Menzies.  The Chinese undertook some serious sea expeditions in the 1400s, exploring the East African coast as far south as Mozambique and probably touching on the northern coast of Australia.  It's conceivable that at some point in their long history the Chinese -- purposely or by accident -- may have reached the northwest Coast of North America -- as it is equally plausible that American Indians may have reached out toward Asia. Read \\"Kon Tiki.\\"        Despite a kernel of fact, most of Menzies' book is a mountain of nonsense.  To take just one claim, Menzies has the Chinese circumnavigating ice-bound Greenland, explaining that this was possible because of a warmer climate in those days.  Au contraire, Gavin.  As every geographer knows, the period from about 1400 to 1700 is known as the \\"Little Ice Age\\"  and temperatures were significantly colder than they are today.  Greenland was not circumnavigatable by sea in 1421; rather the Norse colonies in Greenland were dying out because of the miserable weather.  The first non-motorized circumnavigation of Greenland took place in 2001, and it was accomplished by dogsled and kayak, not a 15th century Chinese junk.               Many, many other examples of silliness are found in the book. Suffice it to say that this book should be marketed in the fantasy section of your local book store.      Smallchief	2005-02-06

I won't disagree -- although perhaps this book is more about mis-adventures than adventures.<br /><br />The author was the youngest member of Robert Falcon Scott's 1910-1913 expedition to Antarctica.  He became one of Scott's most valued colleagues, but fortunately for himself and literature he was not selected as one of the four members of the expedition to accompany Scott to the South Pole.  None of those five survived.<br /><br />In 600 pages, Cherry-Garrard describes the hazards and hardships of living and working in Antarctica.  However, although one admires the courage and persistence of the members of Scott's expedition, it is clear from the beginning of the book that the expedition was an amateur affair.  The Norwegian Amundson beat Scott to the South Pole and returned safely with a minimum of fuss and bother by giving a maximum of attention to technology (Innuit dogs and clothing and Scandinavian skis) and planning.  Much of the hardship described so vividly by Cherry Garrard was self-inflicted -- even though the journeys were truly the \\"worst in the world.\\"  Cherry Garrard's account of a expedition in the dark of an Antarctic winter with temperatures down to a whomping minus 77 F is an example of bull-headed hardiness and an affirmation of the old cliche that adventures are a sign of incompetence. (Read Jack London's story \\"To Build a Fire\\" about the dangers of going out in temperatures lower than minus 50 degrees.)<br /><br />As a reading experience \\"The Worst Journey in the World\\" is as good as you will find anywhere -- but it's not a perfect book.  Annotation and explanatory notes would make some things clearer to the reader. Photographs and better maps would also help.  You may be inspired to seek out other books about Polar exploration which, like mountain climbing and fly fishing, seems to attract people who can write.<br /><br />Smallchief	2005-02-06

Scott became virtually a cult figure in England as an exemplar of glorious failure and enlightened amateurism.  By contrast, Amundson was considered an opportunist and (gasp!) a professional who stole England's divine right to be first to the Pole.         The author doesn't waste sentiments on Scott who was \\"weak, incompetent, and stupid\\" -- nor on England: \\"an empire in decline.\\" He makes his case well.  Amundson was clearly the superior polar explorer of the two. In alternating chapters \\"Last Place on Earth\\" tells the life stories of Amundson and Scott.  The highlights of the book are the tales of Amundson's organized and competent race to the South Pole contrasted with Scott's tragic end while making his way back to his base camp after reaching the Pole one month after Amundson.     The most damning of the author's allegations is that Scott discounted any lessons from the experts of polar living: the Innuit (Eskimos). Amundson learned the use of sled dogs from the Innuit and he and his team wore Innuit clothing and snow goggles. Scott also resisted the use of skis and only one of the members of his large team was an expert skier. Dogs, skis, and good leadership made the difference.  Amundson's journey to the South Pole was relatively easy; Scott's a man-killing misery. In his diaries Scott blamed bad weather for his troubles; the author demonstrates that the weather Scott experienced was no worse than that faced by other explorers.                            This is truly a fine and exciting book that will make you hunger to read more about Polar exploration.       Smallchief	2005-02-03

The Viking Portable Library collection excludes some of his most important stories and poems.  This volume has a better selection of his early work -- although Kipling was so prolific that a second large volume of his best could easily be compiled. This book however excludes some his cryptic and difficult later stories such as \\"Dayspring Mishandled\\" which were little noted in their day.          The master himself wrote the introduction to \\"A Kipling Pageant\\" in 1935 not long before his death and the essay is a priceless example of Kipling's imagination at work. Among the essential reading in this book I would list the following stories: Lispeth, The Man Who Would Be King, Without Benefit of Clergy, Mowgli's Brothers, Rikki-tikki-tavi\\" and \\"The Church That Was at Antioch.\\"  The best poems include \\"If, Recessional, Mandalay, Gunga Din,\\" and \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy.\\"  An essay, \\"An Interview with Mark Twain\\" is excellent.  However, don't bother to read the novel included in this book, \\"A Light that Failed\\" unless you're really addicted to Kipling.  Kipling was not a novelist -- except for \\"Kim\\" which is wonderfully atmospheric, although uneven.      Kipling got a bad rap as a racist and conservative among his contemporaries.  Actually, he had more sympathy with the subjects of British Imperialism than did many of his critics -- and vastly more understanding.  What made Kipling great as an artist was an imagination so expansive that he could imagine himself as the ruler of a country in the future, the engine of a ship, a boy lost in the jungle, a Cockney soldier, an early Christian missionary, or an old woman looking back on life.    Kipling and Somerset Maugham in my opinion are the best writers of short stories in English.

Thor Heyerdahl, a young man who was to become a famous adventurer and author, felt the same way and he and his new wife came to the island of Fatu Hiva in the Marquesas to live in 1937. The couple lived on the island for eight months following in the footsteps of previous visitors such as Herman Melville and Paul Gauguin.       Life was idyllic on Fatu Hiva. The daily bread could be picked off trees amidst tropical splendor and a clear, splashing river. But there was also trouble in paradise: disease --elephantitis and open running sores -- mosquitos, unfriendly natives, and mud. In seeing the remnants of Marquesan civilization -- destroyed by the white man and his diseases -- the germ of Heyerdahl's theories about trans-oceanic contacts between America and Polynesia grew.         \\"Fatu Hiva\\" is a fetching book, both for its delicious descriptions of living in a tropical paradise and the frank accounts of disillusionment of the young couple.  In the end, the Garden of Eden became cloying and they stared endlessly out to sea longing to see the sail of an inter-island boat so they could escape their island and return to civilization. \\"One can't buy a ticket to paradise,\\" was Heyerdahl's concluson.

In 1947, six young Norwegians floated in a balsa-wood raft from Peru to the Polynesian islands of the South Seas. The trip took them 101 days and they traveled 4,300 nautical miles across the Pacific without seeing a single other boat or ship. Only occasionally were they able to communicate with the outside world by radio, and the possibility of rescue should their primitive raft sink or break up in the heavy seas they often experienced was slim to none.         The journey was inspired by the theories of Thor Heyerdahl who speculated that the ancient civilizations of Peru had floated across the Pacific to reach the Polynesian islands.  Scoffed at by scientists, Heyerdahl organized the expedition to prove that a raft crossing of the Pacific was possible.  It was a foolhardy stunt -- but makes for a great story.        \\"Kon Tiki\\" tells the story of the expedition from beginning to the end when the crew of the raft is marooned on an idyllic paradise isle in the South Pacific.  Rereading the book after many years, I was most impressed with how isolated and empty the Pacific Ocean was and how unexploited was its sea life in 1947. I fear that such is no longer the case.             Heyerdahl's theories of oceanic migrations from the Americas to Polynesia are still pooh-baahed by archaeologists today, although it seems that the sweet potato by some means made it from Peru to Polynesia in pre-historic times. Whatever your opinion may be regarding Heyerdahl as a scientist the story of the \\"Kon Tiki\\" is unique and original.  Read it and weep because the opportunity for an adventure of such scope and daring is no longer possible in our over-crowded world.     Smallchief	2005-01-27

She was one of the best known travel writers of the Victorian era.  She suffered from an odd probably psychosomatic disease that made her an invalid at home in Scotland -- but plant her down in China, Colorado, or Japan and give her a difficult and dangerous road to travel and she is as hardy as a bristlecone pine.       This book is about a journey Ms. Bird made about 1897 from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the Sichuan basin and the borders of Tibet.  She did most of it as a solo female, accompanied only by Chinese bearers and servants, and traveling by mule, boat, foot, sedan chair, and about every other means of transport.  She was more than 60 years old at the time and suffered from rheumatism.         Ms. Bird is a demon for detail and she comments on a vast range of topics during the course of her travels -- and she seems to know what she is talking about, unlike many travel writers whose accounts are embroidered and exaggerated.  With Bird you have confidence that she's telling you the truth, quaint though some of her views may be.         The most interesting part of the book, in my opinion, are Ms. Bird's difficulties with Chinese officials and the public.  She was beaned in the head with a rock on one occasion, which caused a \\"brain disturbance\\" that lasted a year; Chinese frequently refused to sell her food or give her shelter and officials tried to intimidate and discourage her at every opportunity.  But Isabella Bird was undaunted, crossing 11,000 feet passes, weathering snowstorms, hunger, and hardship and recording her experiences in amazing detail.  The book is nearly 600 pages long.                 Isabella Bird's travel books are travel classics. Read this or any of her books to get a tale of exotic adventures in foreign lands -- and to wonder why this respectable female was so addicted to tramping around the world.

We need a modern annotated publication and evaluation of the diary and a biography of Taylor -- an adventurous and controversial (to say the least) woman.   <br /> <br />The author is diplomatic in his description of Taylor -- but obviously she was a piece of work, described in another source as a \\"lone wolf\\" and \\"bad at harmonious relationships with colleagues.\\"  Tough, this lady was, capable of an eight-month trek across some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world accompanied only by treacherous (in her view) Chinese and Tibetan guides and helpers. I especially enjoyed the part of her diary in which she negotiates with Tibetan authorities for food, pack animals, and other supplies.  They finally gave in, I am sure, just to get this vexing Englishwoman out of their hair.  She's lucky they didn't shoot her.   <br /> <br />The book consists of a long introduction to Taylor's diary and the diary itself.  It's not all that great, but it's about the only information we have about Taylor.  Elibron Books publishes a facsimile of this 1902 book in paperback.   <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-01-25

The Nearings left \\"civilization\\" in the depression era when Scott was about 50 and spent the next 50 years homesteading rural properties in Vermont and Maine. Actually, if you read between the lines, they spent only part of the year homesteading and the rest traveling and lecuturing.  They were an opinionated pair -- strict vegetarians, organic gardeners, and full of personal idiosyncracies they spend a lot of time rationalizing. For example, they ate with wooden utensils rather than metal silverware because of fear of chemicals. But who can argue with them?  Scott lived to be 100 and Helen lived a long time too.                There are as many contradictions in their philosophy as has a Marxist manifesto.  The \\"simple life\\" as they define it includes a pickup truck (something of a luxury in 1930s Vermont), cement mixer and (gasp!)chemicals to acclerate the workings of their beloved compost pile.  They are anti-capitalist but make a living selling maple sugar, blueberries, and Scott's economic tomes.  I would guess they took advantage of the Depression by buying land at low, low prices from destitute farmers -- but they later donated some of it to the community. Typical of city folk in rural situations they looked down on their neighbors as backward rubes, incapable and unwilling to be educated (indoctrinated) by their betters. I would love to have a book about the Nearings by one of their neighbors.  It could be hilarious.     Amidst the philosophy of a pair of radicals in the country is some good advice on how to build a stone house and wall, tap maple trees, and irritate your neighbors.  The romance of the rural is compelling and I enjoy dipping into their books from time to time.      Smallchief	2005-01-21

For two decades the island has been torn apart by violence between the two largest ethnic groups, Buddhist Sinhalese and Hindu Tamils.  One of my most vivid memories of Colombo was a march of Buddhist monks carrying signs with political sentiments such as, \\"Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country.\\"  The Tamil Tigers, on their part, will probably be remembered as virtuoso suicide bombers.  So much for \\"tolerant\\" Asian religions.   <br /> <br />Most of the violence has now ceased and the traveler need not be concerned with it, although traveling by land from Colombo to  Jaffna in the north one has to pass along a dirt highway lined in places with minefields.  Military fortresses will also be encountered along main highways.  <br /> <br />I'm not much of a beach fan, although that's why most tourists go to Sri Lanka.  Given the ravages of the tsunami most of the beach resorts on the South and East coasts have probably been damaged.  So this is an excellent time to go to Sri Lanka to see the beautiful tea estates in the cool, cloudy hill country and the Buddhist monuments near the center of the island. For the sand and sea set, some decent beach resorts near Colombo on the West coast were probably not affected by the Tsunami.       <br /> <br />The Lonely Planet Guide sums up the many attractions of this beautiful country.  As always, it includes reliable information on history and practical matters plus sidebars on interesting subjects such as birds, turtles, train schedules, and 101 uses for a coconut.    <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-01-19

This is superb writing about war.  We know the individual soldiers, and we see the battle through their terrified eyes.  We see also the broken bodies of the aftermath and the attempts by military brass to put the best face possible on the events by inflating the casualty totals of the North Vietnamese and declaring victory. The author adds to the power of the narrative by introducing the perspective of Vietnamese participants in the battle.  <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-01-17

The idea of a canal first gained currency with the invasion of Egypt in 1798 by Napoleon. Several odd mystical intellectuals promoted the canal but the leader came to be diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, a practical, ambitious fellow who conceived the canal as a monument to himself.  The canal was finished in 1869 and royalty from all over Europe flocked to Egypt for its inauguration.                   Most of the book concerns Lesseps and his diplomatic and commercial machinations to get both political approval for the canal and the money to build it.  The most interesting of the politicians in the book are the Egyptian leaders, Muhammad Ali, Muhammad Said, and Ismail, whose effort to westernize while staving off the West were ultimately futile.  One wonders how history might have been different if these three Egyptian leaders and Egypt might have been treated with more consideration by the Western powers.   Lesseps, much as one might admire his steadfastness, is not a very likeable person, nor are any of the other Westerners in the book.        Karabell is an excellent writer and the book never lags in attention.  As one person's opinion, however, I would have appreciated a little less focus on wacko intellectuals and high-society hijinks and more on the challenges faced by the engineers and the construction workers on the ground. There is only one unreadable map -- when will publishers learn that good maps are essential to a book? -- and not enough detail about the extraordinary engineering challenges faced by the builders.

Volume two consist of poetry, most of which I have not read.    After 30 years or so, I reread many of the short stories in this volume.  His most famous story \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\" is still superb and should be included in every high school American Literature course.  Perhaps it still is, although the ACLU has probably petitioned for the removal of TDADW from classes on the ground that the Devil is a character and the story promotes religion.       Benet is an unabashed patriot, a liberal, and a humanist.  The stories in the book deal with American history, tales of our time (i.e. the 1930s), and \\"fantasies and prophesies.\\"  One of the most interesting stories in the latter category is the apocalyptic tale \\"The Waters of Babylon.\\" While its message may be familiar to us now, the story was written before the Atomic bomb and thus was highly original -- and shocking -- in its day.        Most of the other stories in the book are good, clever stories but not essential reading.  Therefore, somewhat sadly, I conclude that Benet doesn't deserve the highest rating -- although \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\" should be included in any collection of best American short stories.

Hillerman's usual weaving of Indian culture into his mysteries is mostly absent.  Hillerman also preaches in this novel, a bit unusual for him.  He argues against the US war on drugs as futile and harmful and he exposes the theft of billions of dollars from Indian tribes by fraud in the payment of royalties on oil and gas revenues.  <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-01-13

Traveling mostly by train, without any pre-arranged plans or reservations, we found this guide accurate and up-to-date. Few Romanians speak English or other world languages, so it's a bit more of an adventure traveling on the cheap than in most of Europe.  You may need to resort to the 2 pages of Romanian words and phrases in the guide.  Given the sorry state of the US dollar, Romania is also one of very few European countries which is still relatively inexpensive for Americans.             As a country Romania is scenic and pleasant, much sunnier and more open than the legend of Dracula portends.  We visited most of the places associated with Dracula and enjoyed looking into the country's rich history and ethnic background: Romanian, Hungarian, Turk, and German. Other than complaints about unemployment and corrupt politicians, we didn't encounter much to suggest the country's well-publicized dark side.                    The \\"Rough Guide\\" was a competent guide to most of what you would like to know about Romania.  For example, among the interesting tidbits in the book, is the sidebar about the beginning of the Romanian revolution in 1989 in the city of Timisoara, a place worth visiting.

He scorned the Arizona desert.  \\"It's not a real desert,\\" said he, \\"there are plants.\\"  So there are.  The Arizona desert is lush and diverse and, when the weather's not too hot, offers some of the best walking you will find anywhere.  If it's too hot in the lowlands, go uphill and try some of the high-elevation hikes described in this book.    <br /> <br />This hiking guide contains descriptions of 98 hikes in southern Arizona ranging in length from about 1 mile to 20 miles.  For each hike there is a map and a description on how to get there, information on difficulty, availability of water, elevation, etc.  Hikes are described in the Chricahua Mountains, the Border ranges, Huachuca Mountains, Aravaipa Country, Pinaleno Mountains, Saguaro National Park, Santa Catalina Mountains, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge.      <br /> <br />I used the guide for hikes in Saguaro National Park and several other areas and found it reliable and informative. Unfortunately, as of 2004, several of the most interesting trails described in the book are closed because of a forest fire in the Santa Catalina Mountains near Tucson.  Hopefully, they will be reopened soon.    <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-01-12

Most of the hikes described are in Colorado's Rocky Mountains at high elevations and are pretty steep. However, a few trails are in urban areas and in flat terrain that are suitable for lazy old duffers like me who like easy, short walks rather than challenges to the cardio-pulmonary system.

Isaac McCoy, a Baptist missionary, was a proponent of creating an Indian state to solve the second problem. <br /> <br />McCoy perceived early on that the White man and Indian tribes would never be able to live in close proximity.  The more numerous Whites would always take advantage of the Indians.  White laws and customs held the Indians in \\"bondage.\\" To save the Indians, McCoy conceived of the creation of an Indian state centered on the territory of Kansas and he promoted his vision for more than 20 years.  The idea had merit, and was later partially applied in Oklahoma, although the idea of a self-governing Indian state never gained much political support in Congress -- besieged as it was by land-hungry whites.  <br /> <br />This is a scholarly biography of Isaac McCoy and his vision of an Indian state.  It's clearly and competently written, footnoted and indexed.  It has a small number of good illustrations and a couple of fairly good maps.  McCoy, frontier born and bred, is a pretty interesting fellow who probably deserves a bit more prominence than he is accorded in American history.  <br /> <br />Smallchief	2005-01-09

In portraying U.S. military culture, folkways, and technology he's unmatched.      \\"Retreat Hell\\" tells the story of the Korean War in the couple of months of 1950 while the North Koreans were on the run and it looked like the U.S. would have its troops \\"home for Christmas.\\" The surprising intervention of hundreds of thousands of Communist Chinese soldiers was to set the US troops back on their heels and force a bitter, bloody winter retreat.  This book tells the story of a CIA unit gathering evidence that the Chinese are going to intervene and the unwillingness of \\"El Supremo\\" (General Douglas MacArthur) to believe the evidence.      That sounds interesting and it is, but \\"Retreat Hell\\" is crowded with too much minutiae and too little story.  Much of the book describes the preparation, distribution, and reading of memoranda, eating and drinking, and military machinations to steal men and material from each other. Endless and tiresome accolades are showered on the omnipotent hero, Major Kenneth \\"Killer\\" McCoy.  Calling this a book about the Marine Corps is a stretch, as most of the book is about a CIA unit,  politicians, and generals, including Harry S. Truman and the aforementioned El Supremo.

Susie Rijnhart, a Canadian, was married to a Dutch missionary, and the two of them came to the Tibetan border to work among the lamas of the great lamasery of Kumbum.  So isolated were they that months passed between European visitors, but they wanted to venture even further into the unknown and decided to travel toward Lhasa, the forbidden capital of Tibet -- unvisited by Europeans for decades.  The trip was a disaster.  The couples' infant son died and Mr. Rijnhart disappeared.  Left alone save for a few native helpers on the high plateau of Tibet, Susie made her way out of Tibet to the nearest missionary station.          This is the account of Susie Rijnhart's four years in China, especially the fatal attempt on Lhasa.  It's a straightforward account, scrupulously honest in its details I would guess, although I have always suspected that the old missionaries were a bit disingenuous in expressing their motives.  Adventure, as much as a desire to \\"preach the gospel to every creature\\" may have propelled them to ends of the earth.  There were hundreds of millions of unsaved souls in all parts of China; it hardly seems necessary to have looked for more of them in Tibet as did the Rijnhart's and a few others.  But, in telling their tales, the missionaries left us some of the best eye-witness accounts of \\"strange lands and exotic peoples\\" which we have.           Dr. Susie Carson Rijnhart is forgotten while lesser explorers of Tibet are recalled. I recommend her book to anyone with an interest in old travel books, Tibet, or missionaries.

Frank Dobie was a folklorist of Texas and \\"Coronado's Children\\" may be his best and most famous book. He was born in 1888 and bridged the old west and modern times. CC was written in 1930 when many of the old timers, who knew how to spin a yarn, were still around. Dobie sought them out and recorded their stories of lost gold and buried treasure. He was also a serious scholar who rummaged through Spanish and American archives to give authenticity to his stories -- and he was not adverse to saddling up a horse and doing a little on-the-ground research.  <br /> <br />\\"Coronado's Children\\" has inspired thousands of otherwise normal people to pick up a shovel and head off to some god-forsaken wasteland to dig in the ground looking for the \\"Lost San Saba Mine,\\" the booty of pirate Jean Lafitte, or the $2 million the James boys supposedly buried in the Wichita mountains of Oklahoma. These are the kind of stories that dreams are made of -- and who knows? Some of them might be true.  <br /> <br />Dobie has collected nineteen tales in CC and he tells them beautifully in prose that is conversational and colorful.

I haven't been to Eritrea so I can't comment on the guide for that country.      The Lonely Planet series, in general, is short on describing luxury accomodations, dining, and chichi places and long on local history, customs, and out of the way places.  Described in the guide, for example, are the dubious pleasures of chewing \\"chat,\\" the lovely Ethiopian coffee ceremony, and the possibilities for trekking in several Ethiopian national parks.          Ethiopia is one of most contradictory and complex countries in the world.  It it one of the oldest Christian countries, claims to house the Ark of the Covenant (remember \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\") in a church in Aksum, boasts \\"Lucy\\" the bones of one of the oldest ancestors of human beings, and has some of Africa's most spectacular scenery, the Blue Nile falls for example. Ethiopians have a strong, confident ancient culture and perhaps the most distinctive cuisine in the world. Steak tartare fans will like kifto.  Cold beer and hot pasta (reflecting the brief Italian colonization of Ethiopia) can be found most places for less adventurous eaters.     One tip from me that may not be in the guide.  Ethiopians for some reason are reluctant to accept 1996 US $100 bills and any bill that is torn or worn.               Ethiopia is a country well worth visiting.

Somerset Maugham	Books	5	28	29	N	N	The Best Short Stories Ever	Somerset Maugham wrote the most readable, well-plotted, exotic, and interesting short stories of any writer I have ever read. He is frequently described with faint praise as being \\"competent.\\" Well, if you want formless sketches of the deeper wells of human experience, Maugham may not be your cup of tea. But if you like good stories, often with an trick ending, he's as good as you will find. As a writer for magazines, Maugham understood that he had to get the reader interested in his story quickly, and he does so.  Once you get a paragraph or two into a Maugham story, you are hooked.        Volume one of this handsome set is titled \\"East and West.\\"  It consists of 30 short stories written between 1919 and 1930. Volume Two, titled \\"The World Over\\" has 61 stories, some of them only brief sketches. Most of the stories have the exotic settings Maugham is famous for: the South Pacific, China, and Southeast Asia.  Many of them deal with the British and other Westerners interacting with the Orient and Orientals. The best known and representative is \\"Rain\\" in which a missionary takes on the task of reforming a prostitute. A few spy stories, reflecting Maugham's experience in World War I, and tales of the occult are mixed in with the tales of the Orient.  It is difficult to single out the best Maugham stories because he is so consistently good.    Maugham pushed the envelope in his day writing of infidelity, inter-racial romance, and incest. In one of his stories \\"The Treasure\\" a very proper London gentleman beds his very proper housekeeper with consequences that illustrate English reserve and class distinctions as well as could any scholarly treatise.  Maugham is cynical, sarcastic, world weary, and a bit macabre in dissecting society and uncovering seamy, shocking facts about \\"normal\\" people.          Not the least of the attractions of these books are the introductions written by Maugham in which he sets out his theories of literature and indulges himself with some bitingremarks about his critics.  Mr. Maugham was not a very nice man, but he was a great writer of short stories.        Smallchief	2004-12-29

At the South Rim, elevation 7,300, the views of the Chihuahua desert go on forever with hardly a sign that the species Homo Sapiens exists.  At this elevation in the Chisos mountains the vegetation is more reminiscent of the Rocky Mountains than of the desert.  There is a thrill too in the signs forbidding children from hiking because of the danger from mountain lions.   <br /> <br />This book describes 44 hikes from .2 to 19 miles long in Big Bend National Park and three in neighboring Big Bend Ranch State Park.  The two parks are remote and immense, totalling together more than 1,500 square miles.  The description of each hike includes a map, directions about how to get to the trail head, elevations, difficulty, and hiking traffic, which is light to non existent for most trails. This is lonely country away from a very few public facilities. Water is not available on most hikes in this desert area.  <br /> <br />This is a well-written and illustrated trail guide book which is well worth your investment if you plan to visit and hike Big Bend.   <br /> <br />Smallchief	2004-12-26

This is far from a complete guide, but rather a potpourri of places to visit, eat, and stay.   <br /> <br />The book divides Oklahoma into seven regions and covers the attractions of each region, especially in small towns and rural areas. Down-home, long-established restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts are well-described.  Sidebars sprinkled liberally through the text provide a historical overview of Oklahoma, especially of its cowboy and Indian heritage.    <br /> <br />There is no Grand Canyon or Yosemite in Oklahoma.  The natural attractions are modest.  For those from more congested states, the charm of Oklahoma is open empty country and friendly people, clear blue skies, and weather that is pretty good on the average -- but the weather in Oklahoma is rarely average.  \\"The immensity of the plains can exhilarate or overwhelm travelers,\\" says the author.  That's about right.  Oklahoma is a good place to take a random drive down a country road. Amidst the endless prairie, the oil wells, and the wheat fields, there's usually a valley oasis of woodland, a rocky mesa, one of Oklahoma's big man-made lakes, or an old town with a restaurant that features chicken-fried steak and mashed potatoes.

From the center of Big Bend National Park at The Basin it is more than 100 miles by road to the nearest Supermarket in Alpine.   <br /> <br />The author has compiled an authoritative history of the sparsely-populated Big Bend. The prose is scholarly rather than poetic, but the story is fascinating. Included in the book are maps, old photographs, a listing and description of historic sites, a thorough bibliography, extensive notes, and an index.  <br /> <br />The Spaniard Cabeza de Vaca and his colleagues probably passed through the Big Bend in the 1530s; and the Spanish conquest began in 1580.  Later the tide was turned as the Apaches and Comanches in the 18th and 19th century depopulated the Big Bend with their constant raids on Mexican settlements. In the 19th century the \\"gringos\\" arrived at the Big Bend and established ranches, mines, and wax factories -- the wax coming from the candelilla plant.  One of the most interesting sections of the book concerns the conflict between Mexican revolutionaries and bandits and the U.S army in the early part of the 20th century during the era of Pancho Villa.  The book concludes with the creation of Big Bend National Park in 1955.  <br /> <br />The Big Bend is a tough country with a colorful history and this book is worth reading, especially if you plan to visit Big Bend National Park.            <br /> <br />Smallchief	2004-12-26

The characters of \\"White Mischief\\" are about the most disgusting and useless bunch of parasites that can be imagined.      \\"White Mischief\\" is about a murder in colonial Kenya in 1941 and the people who were involved in the case.  The murderee was Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Errol, and the accused murderer was Sir John Henry Delves Broughton. This book is an examination of the free and easy \\"Happy Valley\\" society that both belonged to, a recapitulation of the trial, and an examination of the evidence.  The author's investigation, carried out over decades, includes interviews with people connected with the case, including the loathsome Diana, wife of the accused murderer and mistress of the murderee -- and a strong candidate among others to be the mastermind of the affair.  (As this book, although non-fiction, is something of a murder mystery, I won't spoil it by revealing the author's conclusions as to who killed Lord Errol.)          It's a crackin' good story, set in the splendid \\"White Highlands\\" of Kenya.

Reading \\"Inside South America\\" makes you realize how little has changed in South America since 1966.  The problems are still the same in nearly every country; \\"la violencia\\" continues in Colombia, the old style Latin American dictators are a vanishing species, but the new democrats are a mixed blessing.  The political prominence of the US seems to have declined since 1966.  In nearly every country Gunther visited the U.S. Ambassador was a major personage and USAID and the Peace Corps were highly visibile institutions. I don't think that's true anymore as the U.S. government seems to be hiding in bunkers.        Gunther has a tried and true technique.  He visits a country, calls on its President or Prime Minister, meets with the opposition, the U.S. Ambassador, and other figures of influence, and mixes in observations on a wide range of topics that he thinks are useful to understand the country. He strives to explain who runs a country, what ails the country, and what the country needs.  In 1966, the grand preoccupation of the U.S. and Gunther was the influence of Communism and this is a dominant theme in his examination of each of the 10 South American republics he visited.      The best parts of the book include Gunther's \\"semi-affectionate\\" look at Paraguay and his interview with the troglodytic but oddly appealing dictator Stroessner; his lengthy account of the tortured politics of Argentina and the Perons; and his pungent observations: Uruguay needs more Uruguyans and one economist, Peru needs a revolution, Venezuela needs a little sense, and Brazil has a lot of beauty parlors but not many book stores.

The Old Man imparts salty wisdom and a respect for quail, guns, turtle eggs, whiskey, poor whites, and rural negroes while the two of them roam the woods, swamps and sounds.              I encountered \\"The Old Man and the Boy\\" as a monthly column in \\"Field and Stream\\" Magazine in the mid-1950s and it's been with me since.  The book is a collection of 28 of those columns.  I pick the book up every couple of years and reread one or two of the stories.  It reminds me of my own rural boyhood in Oklahoma when a gun and a fishing pole were constant companions. I had a real fine time too.         The most delicious descriptions of the book are of country cooking.  I can't read Robert Ruark's tales of frying ham and eggs without heading for the kitchen to rustle up a \\"mess\\" of my own. The smell of campfire coffee, swamp water, and salty brine permeates \\"The Old Man and the Boy.\\"              Much is made of books like \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" which are considered \\"literature\\" because they convey the angst of growing up.

Shirer was a journalist stationed in Berlin from 1934 to 1940 and thus an eyewitness to the growth of Facism in Europe, especially the Nazi regime in Germany.  He observes and reports on the events leading up to World War II and the stunning German victories during the first year of the war.  Shirer seems to have been about everywhere that anything happened and his eye-witness accounts are priceless as background to the \\"gathering storm\\" in Europe.   <br /> <br />This is a diary which Shirer admits in his introduction was written with the thought of publication.  Thus, like others I was irritated by the ethnic slurs he directs at Germans and by his obvious political partisanship.   For example, he bemoans the defeat of the Republic in Spain with the statement, \\"our side has lost.\\"  I can only interpret that remark to mean that he personally identified with the Spanish Republic.  His remark about \\"our side\\" certainly would make me suspicious about the objectivity of any of his reporting on Spain.  Clearly, however, Shirer saw his diary (published before the US entered World War II) less as a balanced piece of reportage than as an anti-Facist manifesto backed up most impressively by his personal experiences.  Read in that context, \\"Berlin Dairy\\" can be appreciated as one of the essential books on the origins of World War II.   <br /> <br />Politics aside, Shirer paints an interesting picture of the life of young Americans in Europe during the 1930s with capsule descriptions of who he met, what he ate and drank, and his day to day life. Throughout the book is the atmosphere of impending doom.  Shirer sensed it early and is thus one of the prophetic voices coming out of the 1930s.              <br /> <br />Smallchief  <br />	2004-12-21

The infamous George Armstrong Custer and his 7th Cavalry undertook an expedition to the Black Hills of South Dakota in 1874.  The authors have undertaken a meticulous reconstruction of Custer's route with topographic maps illustrating every step the great man and his troopers took.  <br /> <br />That might be construed as pretty dry stuff, but about everybody with an interest in landscape should find the photos in this book fascinating. A photographer, William H. Illingworth, accompanied Custer and took several dozen photographs of the Black Hills.  With amazing diligence, the modern day authors of this book tracked down the exact locations from where Illingworth took his photos and took photos from the same place. They publish the two photos, one from 1874 and the other from the present day, on facing pages.  Thus, you have a time machine of sorts -- comparing what Illingworth saw in 1874 with what exists now.  <br /> <br />It is gratifying that so much of the Black Hills hasn't changed much since Custer, although interestingly there are a lot more trees now than there were then.  Moreover, the photos are beautiful in themselves.    <br /> <br />You might not want to read this book from cover to cover unless you are really, really interested in Custer, but you will enjoy comparing the old photos and the new photos and the aesthetics of both. <br /> <br />Smallchief	2004-12-21

Manchester's brilliant opening chapter about a Churchillian day at Chartwell, his country home, establishes quickly in the reader's mind the virtues and foibles of a man who described himself as \\"great\\" and never suffered from false modesty.  <br /> <br />I have a couple of quibbles about the book. First, I thought Manchester's admiration for his subject was occasionally a bit cloying.  Secondly, and more seriously, I don't think Manchester did a very good job detailing the ideological currents of the 1930s.  Manchester portrays Britain's leaders during that era as clueless, weak, and something close to wicked. I would tend to regard them as people who thought that Communism was a greater threat than Fascism and reacted accordingly in the spirit of \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\\"  They were nearly right.  But Churchill, unencumbered by an attraction to foreign ideologies, despised both Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, and early on correctly identified the Nazis as the immediate and most serious menace to his beloved Isle. <br /> <br />That Churchill was right and had the courage to stand isolated and steadfast in his convictions is the basis of his greatness.

Cabeza de Vaca's route across the U.S and Mexico has been the subject of many impassioned scholarly examinations.  Alex and Margery Krieger's is one of the best.   <br /> <br />The book consists of a forward, an updated version of Alex Krieger's 1955 dissertation on Cabeza de Vaca's route, an afterword, and translations of the two accounts of the journey, one by CDV himself and the second by a 16th century historian.  Thus, in this one not-overly-formidable tome is the complete story of Cabeza de Vaca.      <br /> <br />The controversy about CDV is whether he followed a northern route primarily through Texas or a southern route primarily through Mexico in his wanderings from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of California.  Sorry Texas! Krieger persuades me that the evidence in favor of the Mexican route is overwhelming.   <br /> <br />CDV's narrative is important because it is among the first -- and sometimes the only -- description of Indian societies in Florida, Texas, and Mexico. Most of his time was spent among the primitive hunting-gathering Coahuiltecan Indians of the Texas and Mexican coast. These people have disappeared from history with hardly a trace, destroyed by disease and Spanish conquest.  Another interesting and important part of the narrative is CDVs account of Spanish slave-hunters in northern Mexico. We have very few accounts of the North American Indians before their cultures and societies were destroyed by Europeans.  Cabeza de Vaca's is one of the most important and informative.      <br /> <br />Smallchief	2004-12-17

The battles, the strategy, the leaders were all a blur to me. The story in this volume begins after the first clashes of the war near Boston and continues on until the end with the surrender of General Corwallis at Yorktown.        Shaara makes George Washington into a real person -- and the results are impressive.  Washington's patience and perseverance, his management of his army, his steadfast ability to avoid disastrous military defeats and take advantage of small opportunities for victories reconfirm him in my heart as the greatest of Americans.  Other characters are the aged Benjamin Franklin practicing diplomacy in France, Generals Greene, Wayne, Lee, Cornwallis, and foreign volunteers such as Lafayette and Baron von Steuben.  I particularly enjoyed a brief scene in which von Steuben, a Prussian, confronts the job of turning an unruly mob of American soldiers into an army. This is a miitary history.  Short shrift and unkind words are given to the political efforts of the Continental Congress and its members.       Shaara writes fiction about as close to fact as it can be.  The book includes all-essential maps of major battles and the descriptions of battles can be taken as authentic -- although Shaara gets inside the head of major characters to sketch motivation and character.  This is one of few books I have read on the American Revolution -- and certainly is the best I have read.     Smallchief	2004-10-04

The writer is a British bartender who mounted an expedition to the Inca country in the early 1980s.  Retreating -- as did most foreigners -- from the region during the reign of terror by the Sendero Luminoso he returned in the late 1990s to continue his explorations.  The author is refreshingly candid, irreverent, and much less pretentious than most explorers and archaelogists.  He avoids the \\"gee whiz, I was the first white man ever to overcome incredible hardships and discover a lost civilization\\" claims of many writers.      The subject matter is magnificient. The remains of the Inca include far more than the well-known ruins of Machu Pichu and Sacsahuaman (Sexy-Woman to the tourists). The Inca heartland in Peru and the ceja de la selva (eyebrow of the jungle) is as mysterious, little-explored, and rugged as any chunk of real estate on the planet.  The author's accounts of his rediscoveries of long forgotten ruins are fascinating, not least for his tales of hardships and humor (...)his way over 14,000 feet mountain passes and through trackless jungles with a variety of feckless companions. Woven into the narrative is the story of the Spanish conquest of the Incas.      I learned from this book how little is known about the Incas and what an extraordinary civilization they were.	2004-10-01

After a bloody, inconclusive first day at Gettyburg on July 1, 1863, Robert E. Lee had two choices.  He could assault the Union forces on the high ground extending south of the Pennsylvania town of Gettysbury, or he could maneuver, slip around the left flank of the Union Army and look for a better place to fight a battle.  In real life, Lee chose to assault the Union armies in place -- and lost.  In this book, he maneuvers. He sends General Longstreet around the flank of the Union with most of the army in the hope that he will catch the Union army napping or confused.<br /><br />  What makes the book good is the excellent and authentic descriptions of battle scenes and the portrayal of many characters, including Henry Hunt, the Union artillery leader, John Buford, the Union cavalry leader, \\"Ol' Pete\\" Longstreet, Lee himself, and Meade the Union commander.  Battle heroes of real-life Gettysburg such as Joshua Chamberlain show up here too, but playing a different role.  The authors are sympathetic to most of the major military figures in the book -- although there are a few villains too.  The book never flounders on the shores of implausibility.  Once can imagine that this alternative scenario might have happened had Lee made a different decision on July 1.  The authors do a good job in maintaining the suspense as to who will win the climatic battle until the very end.  Gettysburg\\" is a book that will make you proud whether your sympathies lie with the North or the South.<br /><br />  One minor criticism. I though the book was a little too long.  Authors seem to shoot for 450 pages when writing a novel; I think 350 is sufficient.	2004-07-27

In World War I stupid and unimaginative  generals sent hundreds of thousands of men to their deaths in parade-ground charges into the machine guns of the enemy.  The common soldiers lived knee deep in mud in the trenches while just a few miles away prissy staff officers dined on white tablecloths and plotted the next ridiculous attack. <br />Au contraire regarding the British army says the author, a former British military officer -- and he says so vociferously.  After the war, poets and biased historians gave a distorted picture of life in the trenches and created a myth of brutal, uncaring officers.  The author marshals quite a few facts in support of his view.  For example, he maintains that few British units spent more than three days at a time in the trenches and more that 4 or 5 days a month on the firing line.  The mistakes of the British army were largely a result of the necessity of quickly building up a small pre-war army into a much larger one and the resultant inexperience of both officers and men.   Contrary to the opprobrium usually poured on the head of British commander, Field Marshall Douglas Haig, the author finds him to be a man who did the best with what he had.  <br />Corrigan has little use for British politicians.  The Prime Minister Lloyd George comes across as meddling, dishonest, philandering obstacle to winning the war.  Winston Churchill suffers from \\"flights of fancy.\\"  He likewise has little use for the French, especially after a soldier's mutiny in 1917 reduced the capability of the French army to defense only.  He gives a nod of appreciation to the Americans, but \\"in 1918 it was the British army which made the major contribution to the defeat of the German army.\\"  Moreover, he claims that the British army of 1918 was a better army that Monty's in 1945.     <br />Corrigan's view of World War I is so radically different from most other authors that I don't know how much credibility to give him.  He makes a good case for his point of view.  Still, the British had almost 700,000 soldiers killed in World War I out of a population of 45 million.  The author points out that British losses were less than German and French losses -- but, anyway you look at it, 700,000 dead is a bloodbath and suggests that British strategy and tactics were hardly brilliant.  I highly recommend this book as a well-argued, icon-breaking history of the British army in World War I.	2004-07-18

The first assault on credibility is the fact that the main character, Connor Fitzgerald, an assassin for the CIA, is a regular boy-scout kind of guy much admired for the content of his character as well as his chillingly efficient professional skill. Give me a break!  Nice, normal guys, I don't think, go around murdering people in cold blood as a profession. <br /> The author is clever at setting a good scene with authentic details and he might have sold me on the notion that nice guys can be assassins - but he couldn't sell me a wholesale lot of plot twists and turns which add up to implausibility.  Connor is so smart and has so many friends that leap into the story to help him out at critical points that he outwits everyone - the CIA, the Russians, the Russian Mafya (yes, it's spelled that way) -- evading capture and execution and effortlessly finding opportunities to stalk heavily-guarded world leaders.  Thus, about half-way through the book, I began to lose interest in the story and from then on I just turned pages quickly to get to the end.	2004-07-12

She takes only minor liberties with the facts so her novels can be considered an enjoyable way to amplify your knowledge of medieval history. <br />  \\"Time and Chance\\" is the well-known tale of the struggle for power between Henry II, King of England and about one-half of what is now France, and Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury.   The fabulous Eleanor of Aquitaine is Henry's competent wife and Queen.   (My picture of Eleanor will always be that of Katherine Hepburn in the \\"The Lion of Winter.\\")  Henry and Becket, for those who have forgotten the story, are best friends - until Henry appoints Becket as the Archbishop and, suddenly, the friendship dissolves in a bitter Church/State struggle.  It's a disappointment that the author doesn't make much of an effort to unravel the mystery of Becket's character. For me, Becket comes across as more of a fool than a man of principle.  As one of the characters says \\"a wise man ought not to let his tongue cut his own throat.\\"  <br />A weakness of the novel is that it begins with a heavy emphasis on Wales and Welsh characters, but Wales becomes increasingly irrelevant as the story unfolds.  Don't spend too much time trying to figure out who's who among the Welsh, because it doesn't really matter much in the scheme of things.  An effort to comprehend the complex ecclesiastical disputes and sort out the churchly characters in the novel would be much more rewarding.  <br />Criticisms notwithstanding, this is a fine novel, telling an excellent tale about some of the most momentous events of the Middle Ages.  A sequel can be expected that will continue the story of Henry and Eleanor and their sons who include Richard the Lion Hearted, everyone's favorite medieval hero, and John, everyone's favorite medieval villain.  Penman sets the scene for a little different twist on these two in her next book.	2004-07-12

Was he really a villain?<br /> The author says no - although she does not paint him in the most attractive of colors.  He demonstrated a \\"relentless perfectionism, an unwavering and exacting adherence to the strictest letter of the laws of his duty.\\"  But he was also a navigator of enormous skill, took great pains to ensure the health and welfare of his men, and was very sparing of the lash - by comparison with many of his contemporaries. The motivations of the mutineers are unclear, although they certainly had to do with the seductions (female) of Tahiti and the hardships of life aboard a small ship on a big ocean.  <br /> Although there is much confusion in a plethora of similar names (Huggan, Hayward, Heywood, etc.) this is a thorough history of all the events of the Bounty story: the voyage to Tahiti, the idyllic five months on the island, the mutiny, the amazing sea voyage of Bligh and his loyalists in a small launch, the hunt for the mutineers, the trial of those captured, the later life of crewmembers of the Bounty, and the discovery many years later of one surviving mutineer on tiny Pitcairn Island.  \\"The Bounty\\" is a well-written, fascinating, and authoritative account of a trivial but enormously interesting event.   The author persuades me that Bligh has been unfairly maligned by history - although he will likely remain secure in his position as one of Hollywood's favorite villains.	2004-06-30

Why Whittemore is a forgotten writer whose books have gone out of print is a mystery to me.  <br /> \\"Jericho Mosaic\\" is a spy story of sorts set in the historical context of Israel and its neighbors from World War II to the early 1980s.  The principal character is the Runner, an Israeli who becomes a deep-cover spy living in Syria and living the life of a prominent and well-respected Arab nationalist.  The Runner never quite fits into Israeli society but he finds himself comfortable as a Syrian.  The supporting characters include a disfigured old English spy named Bell who lives in a decrepit house in Jericho, the oldest community in the world, and his friends Abu Musa, an Arab patriarch who believes he is 300 years old, and a giant Ethiopian monk named Moses.  These odd characters, plus several others of equal color, give a touch of magical realism to the novel. <br /> But the novel and the characters maintain their sanity in the weird world of Middle Eastern politics.  \\"People in this part of the world,\\" the author says, \\"have always had a thin grasp of reality.\\"   Whittemore steers a treacherous path in a political minefield and never once loses his bearings.  The novel is neither pro nor anti-Israeli and Arab.    Instead, \\"Jericho Mosaic\\" is generous and warm in its portrayal of slightly off center people.   Whittemore lived in and loved the Holy Land and his descriptions of  Jericho and Jerusalem are delicious.   The novel moves slowly and the author's fine writing about mood and landscape can be savored. <br />          \\"Jericho Mosaic\\" is a much better novel than many which have garnered literary prizes and Whittemore should be rated in the first rank of recent American writers.  This edition, rescuing &quot;Jericho Mosaic&quot; from obscurity, includes a lengthy introduction, forward, and afterword and thus we learn a lot about an author who was every bit as colorful as the characters he created.	2004-06-16

It took a dozen soldiers behind the front lines to support and supply a single trooper at \\"the sharp end\\" where the battles were fought and won. \\"The Sharp End\\" focuses on the British and American fighting men.  The author attempts, with considerable success, to describe the daily life of the men on the front lines -- their training, the hardships of the front lines, how they were killed or wounded, what they ate, how they dug foxholes, their morale and why they fought.    Fascinating vignettes abound in this book.  One of the most interesting to me was the author's description of British soldiers' addiction to tea which they brewed up at every opportunity, even while under fire.  A British orderly once described the five principles of preventing shock as \\"a cup of tea and four lumps of sugar.\\"  Getting tea to the front lines had a priority second only to ammunition.      Other vignettes are not nearly so cheerful.  The author gives an extended discussion on subjects such as battle fatigue or \\"shell shock\\", medical care, and self-inflicted wounds.  All in all, reading this book will give you an excellent idea of what it was like for the World War II soldier in the deserts of North Africa, the forest of Western Europe, and the jungles of SE Asia.  It was not a pleasant life -- nor a very long one for many of the infantry who bore, by a large margin, the majority of the casualties of the war.    Smallchief	2004-06-06

Can a book published in 1989 about the American middle class still be relevant?  Sadly -- for reasons that will be detailed below -- it still can be.   The middle class in 2004 is still as selfish, self-seeking, and elitist as it was when Ehrenreich wrote this book.   There are quaint features to the book.  The author speaks indignantly of business executives earning $1 million per year -- a big salary in 1989, but chump change for the CEO of 2004.    Ehrenreich defines the middle class as the professional and managerial workers -- the doctors, lawyers, professors, and mid-level executives -- of our society.  In 2004, members of the professional middle class would have incomes of at least $60,000 up to about $250,000 per year.  They would comprise nearly one half of the American population.  Over the middle class would be the rich, two or three percent of the population, and below would be the lower or working classes, comprising about one half of the population.                Ehrenreich provides a mini-history of the professional middle class from 1960 up till the late 1980s.   What one sees over these three decades is increasing distance between the middle and the lower classes -- plus increasing disinterest in addressing problems of poverty and social injustice in the U.S.  The middle class \\"is too driven by its own ambitions, too compromised by its own elite status, and too removed from those whose sufferings cry out most loudly for redress.\\"   She attributes the middle class's anxiety to \\"fear of falling\\" into the nether-world of Walmart workers and trailer park living.   Her (vague) prescription for wholesome social change is expanded educational opportunity and removing \\"artificial barriers.\\"     The trends Ehrenreich identifies in 1989 have not only continued but intensified. The distance between rich and poor, socially and economically, has increased.  The professional middle class has lost much of what social conscience it once had and movement toward an equalitarian society, discernible in 1960, has been reversed.  Is that a bad thing?  I think so.    Smallchief	2004-06-03

It would be hard to pick which is worse: the insane, die-hard Hitler fanatics or the brutal, deceitful politicians and soldiers of the Soviet Union.   The climax of their titantic struggle came in the rag-tag, last ditch defense of Berlin by the German army as the Russian army inexorably advanced during the last several months of World War II.<br />Beevor achieves a balance between his descriptions of the strategy of the armies and their clashes, the machinations of the politicians, especially Hitler and Stalin, and the experiences of the non-combatants of Berlin: bombed by Allied planes, shelled by Russians, sacrificed to the martyr complex of Adolph Hitler and his seedy colleagues, and fearing the worst when the Russian army arrived.  Their fears were realized as Russian soldiers embarked on an orgy of rape and looting, responding in kind to the atrocities the Germans had committed in the Soviet Union only a year or two before.      <br />This book was most interesting when it focused on the plight (and the cynical humor) of the civilian population in Berlin. It was less successful when describing the battles leading up to the fall of Berlin. The poor quality of the maps and the complexity of the armys' movements left me confused at times. Beevor probably attempts to cover too much ground in a book of only 450 pages,  Nevertheless, \\"Berlin: the Downfall 1945\\" is well worth reading and inspires me to learn more about the fall of Berlin and the plight of the civilian population of Eastern Europe under Russian occupation at the end of WW II.	2004-05-31

Most of them seem to have the words \\"Cambridge\\" or \\"Oxford\\" in their titles, ignore the Pacific war, and are deadly dull.            For an American, Miller and Commager's book is the best one-volume history I have found.  I say \\"for an American\\" because the focus is on battles in which Americans were the participants.  The brutal Eastern front and the war between Germany and the Soviet Union get short shrift; the spectacular air, land and sea battles of the war between the U.S. and Japan get equal attention with the Western Front battles in Europe. Miller doesn't spend a whole lot of time on the events leading up to the war. On page 19 Germany invades Poland and the same breakneck speed in moving from one major battle to another continues.  The analysis of the strategy and politics behind the war is succinct but adequate to enable the reader to understand the big picture.              What makes this history better than others is the reliance of the authors on the words of the participants in the combat.  One half or more of the narrative consists of quotes from eyewitnesses -- mostly soldiers and journalists -- and this gives a worms-eye view of events that seems more valid, and certainly more interesting, that the detached analysis of many writers.

The remaining one-fourth consists of some of the best war writing I have ever read and thus &quot;Goodbye Darkness&quot; gets my highest ratings.   Manchester has the skill and the insight to express events and emotions far beyond that of the ordinary soldier describing his experiences.  <br />Manchester was a Marine Corps Sergeant in an unorthodox front-line Intelligence unit during WW II.    His baptism of fire was Okinawa where he was wounded twice -- once seriously -- during two months of combat.  Most of the men in his squad were killed.  Manchester strengthens my view that the U.S. Marines in World War II were among the finest combat soldiers that ever existed.   But this is not a gung-ho book of combat tales of heroism and sacrifice.  Manchester is equivocal about his service with the Marines and in the war.  Writing the book was apparently a catharsis for him as he pours out feelings unexpressed for many years.       <br />In the final pages of the book, Manchester gives his insight about the reasons the Marines were capable of taking casualties in excess of 50 percent without ever giving up.  First, they had been tempered by the hardships of the depression; secondly, in WW II the whole generation was in the war together -- most of the Marines in his squad were Ivy Leaguers, FDR's sons were in uniform, and the sons of important politicians were being killed alongside the sons of sharecroppers --; and third, nationalism, \\"the absolute conviction that the United States was the envy of all other nations, a country which had never done anything infamous....\\"   Contrast those examples of why the U.S. won WW II with the situation today in Iraq.  <br />A reader can skip much of this book without loss, but Manchester's accounts of his own experiences in battle are exceptional and should go included among the classics of war literature.	2004-05-24

The authors predict that Himmler, head of the SS, would have become Fuhrer and that his wartime leadership of Germany would have been more rational than Hitlers -- although equally brutal.  <br />The authors build up a complex alternative history peopled with characters both real and imagined and events close enough to fact to be believable.  This novel plays itself out -- like the war games the authors invent -- into a climatic battle on the Western front.  It's exciting reading with good characterization and descriptions of desperate battles and a clever, almost comical twist near the end.  Patton and Rommel are the protaganists -- and formidable ones at that -- and the supporting cast is strong.  The Americans tend to be cardboard cutouts, but the Germans characters are drawn with some literary skill.  I recommend the novel to anyone who is interested in World War II and alternative history novels.	2004-05-22

One chapter each is devoted to the Timucua, Guale, Apalachee, Chickasaws, Caddos, Natchez, Quapaw, Cherokee, Upper Creeks, Lower Creeks, and Seminole. <br />     Much of the writing is opaque professorial prose, but the editor reins in the contributors and they generally stay focused on the subject (Indians) rather than embarking on flights of fancy on pet subjects such as &quot;productive intensification&quot; or &quot;diachronic perspective.&quot; If you are interested in what the Indians of the southeastern U.S. were like just before or just after their first contacts with Europeans then this is a good book to read. <br />      The most enigmatic paragraph in the book is titled &quot;Editor's Note.&quot;  In it the editor blandly explains that the most contentious topic in her editing was the use of tribal names in singular or plural form, pointing out that the correct practice &quot;is to use the ethnological singular to indicate plural members of native tribes.&quot;  She apologizes for any offense that may be given native peoples by departures from this rule.  Is this a ponderous joke dressed up in academically correct language? I think it is -- and I applaud the editor's humour, if such is intended. In any case, the Timucua will forgive her as they have been extinct for 300 years.	2004-05-19

In the first American offensive of World War II, Tregaskis went ashore with the Marines at Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942 and stayed with them for the next six weeks while they fought for survival against the Japanese.  Appropriately, he focuses the book on the fighting men rather than himself, giving the name and hometown of Marines he met or were worthy of special mention.<br />&quot;Diary&quot; is a bit understated, perhaps due to wartime censors.  Tregaskis mentions disease, the shortages of food and equipment, and the sense of the marines that they were abandoned by the Navy and forgotten by the &quot;Brass.&quot;  I suspect, however, that the fear and desperation of the Marines at Guadalacanal were considerably stronger than he expressed.     <br />I recommend you read &quot;Diary&quot; with a modern account of the battle for Guadalcanal and maps at your side.  You can then compare Tregaskis' account of events with those of later scholars.  I found &quot;Diary&quot; to be believable in most details and atmosphere -- which is not always the case with on the spot reportage.	2004-05-17

That view has been challenged and mostly disproven over the last two decades.  The historians now believe that the Indians were far more numerous than previously thought and were often living in complex societies.  <br />Disease introduced by the European invaders destroyed the Indians. Some estimates are that 90 percent of Indians died of European diseases. This book is a scholarly study about the impact of disease and depopulation on northwestern Mexico and adjacent Arizona and New Mexico.  Due to the accounts of early Spanish explorers and missionaries, we have a better picture of what happened here than in many other regions of the Americas.<br />The author relies mostly on primary sources to draw a picture of the populous and prosperous Indian societies in this region prior to the arrival of the Spaniards.  He descibes the major Indian groups living in this region, chronicles the history of their contact with the Spanish invaders, and documents the famines that caused a steep decline in their numbers. All in all, a competent book that is well worth reading by those with an interest in this subject.	2004-05-16

It was the first American offensive of World War II and victory hung in a seesaw balance for three months as Americans slowly and painfully gained land, sea, and air superiority over their Japanese opponents.  The costs were enormous.  Japan and America lost 26 ships each.  Most of them were sunk in \\"Iron Bottom Sound\\" in the \\"Slot.\\"  The 18 pilots of one fighter wing of the \\"Cactus\\" air force were reduced to four in less than three months -- but they shot down 83 Japanese planes.  Hammel estimates that 35,000 Japanese died in the battle -- about one third of them of disease and starvation.  U.S. losses of Army, Navy, and Marines totalled about 3,000 dead.  <br />       Eric Hammel has written a competent and readable book on the battle of Guadalcanal from August 7, 1942 when the first Marines stepped on shore until mid-November when the battle was won -- although three months of bloody mop-up operations remained. Hammel covers land, sea, and air operations, and his descriptions range from the strategy sessions of the Brass to the battle experiences of 18-year old Marine privates.  My enthusiasm for this book is restrained however as there are many other accounts in books and on the web which are equally good.<br />         Hammel's technical discussions of battles and strategies are very good; his description of the conditions the marines faced in Guadalcanal -- abandonment by the navy, malaria and dengue, shortages of everything, a shrieking, suicidal enemy who hardly seemed human, a dark, menacing jungle -- is less good. The marines called Guadalcanal &quot;Operation Shoestring&quot; and it deserves the name.  For the Japanese it was even worse.	2004-05-13

This book ranks high on accuracy and detail, but lower on readability.  The narrative is choppy, moving quickly but not too smoothly from one area of the battlefield to another.   Many maps help the reader but -- although I hate to complain about an author who recognizes the value of maps -- there is a shortage of \\"big picture\\" illustrations and narrative.  Gettysburg is so important that it deserves a magisterial prose which Trudeau can't summon up.    <br />          I applaud Trudeau for his insights that Generals Ewell (Confederate) and Howard (Union) were not as incompetent as often portrayed and Trudeau also leavens a bit the ascendant reputation of Joshua Chamberlain whose Maine troops anchored the vulnerable left flank of the Union army.  Trudeau strengthens in my mind the view that this battle was badly mismanaged by Robert E. Lee.<br />         This book doesn't measure up in intensity to Shelby Foote's lengthy description of the battle of Gettysburg in volume two of his monumental work, \\"The Civil War.\\"  It also falls a bit short in quality of Coddington's scholarly study.  But Trudeau is well worth reading and his book deserves a prominent place on the bookshelf of literature about Gettysburg.	2004-05-11

It is a complicated and convoluted book that has generated countless impassioned rebuttals and counter rebuttals.<br /> The author, Martin Bernal, is an agitator of rare talent.  The stated purpose of his book is \\"to lessen European cultural arrogance.\\"  The title suggests that the Greek God Athena, patron of the glorious city of Athens, was black-skinned.  The subtitle, \\"The Fabrication of Ancient Greece\\" suggests that generations of fawning classical scholars have wrongly proclaimed Greece the fount of Western Civilization because of their racial and ethnic prejudices.  (For a typical view of the classicists read Edith Hamilton's famous book, \\"The Greek Way.\\"  She gives the Greeks credit for inventing rational thought, humanistic philosophy, mathematics, science, drama, democracy, medicine, and the atom.)<br /> Bernal wins the argument hands down that the scholars have underestimated the contribution of Egypt to Greek civilization.  His argument in favor of Semitic influences on the Greeks is not nearly so persuasive -- although the alphabet is undeniably an invention of the Semitic Phoenicians.  But Bernal's thesis that Greece was invaded by a Semitic people called the Hyksos in the second millennium B.C. is unconvincing.<br />  What of course interests everybody about &quot;Black Athena&quot; is the suggestion that European civilization evolved from an African -- and possibly black -- civilization.  That leads to some interesting speculation (which Bernal does not fully explore).  According to the Bible, the \\"Children of Israel\\" were held captive in Egypt for several hundred years.  It seems probable some racial mixing between Egyptians and the Israelites occurred during those generations.  Therefore, were the Israelites black?  If Hollywood remakes the movie \\"The Ten Commandments\\" should Denzel Washington be cast as Moses?  What a hoot that would be!<br /> Bernal is uncustomarily brief and unspecific when he discusses the color of the ancient Egyptians.  In this volume he says only that \\"one can usefully call\\" some pharaohs \\"black.\\"  Now, what does \\"usefully black\\" mean?  In a later volume, \\"Black Athena Writes Back,\\" he explains a bit more by saying he \\"never suggested that the Ancient Egyptian population as a whole looked like stereotypical West Africans.\\"  Well, it seems to me that Professor Bernal wimps out on the race issue.  We want  Bernal to examine in detail the evidence about the skin color of the ancient Egyptians and related civilizations, including the Greeks and the Semites.  Why does he brush past this subject with such haste?  Can it be that the fearless Doctor, who spends hundreds of pages flagellating white and European classical scholars for their racial and ethnic prejudices, fears to offend Afro-centric scholars?<br /> \\"Black Athena\\" is one of the most controversial books of the last two decades.

Charles Gatewood played by Jason Patric.  <br />Gatewood, the U.S. army's foremost expert on the Apaches, persuaded Geronimo to surrender in 1886.  Both Geronimo and Gatewood were betrayed by the U.S. government.  Geronimo was sent to Florida to prison; Gateway was sent to oblivion, remaining a lieutenant until the end of his military career.<br />Geronimo is remarkable as a cunning, cruel guerilla leader fighting to keep his freedom from the encroaching Whites; Gatewood is remarkable for the integrity he brought to his job as an indian agent and soldier.  It's comforting to see Gatewood's  qualities are remembered in book and movie long after more conventionally successful men have been forgotten. <br />This book maintains a high standard of accuracy and scholarship. It tells one of the best stories from the old West.	2004-04-18

The sub title of the book is: How the Germans won the battles and how the Americans saved the allies.  In defending this thesis, the author presents statistics that German army casualties on the Western Front were only one-half the casualties of the French and Brits.  He gives a twist to the Battle of Verdun that makes it less of a French victory than a German partial victory and he excoriates the British for their troglodytic infantry tactics.  <br />Most of all, he made a case -- alas, without enough detail to be totally persuasive -- that the entry of the Americans into the war was the decisive factor that led to an allied victory.  <br />The problems of the book include poor maps and brief, incomplete, and less than convincing descriptions of many crucial battles.   I think the author has a pretty accurate view of the ways things were, but his examinations are sometimes superficial. This would be a better book if he had devoted more effort to describing the impact of the Americans on the war, thereby bolstering his opinion.  Still, I am inclined to agree with him about the decisive role of the Americans.  The French and British fought the Germans for four years; but when the American army was deployed in full force the Germans surrendered after three months.  That doesn't seem like a coincidence.	2003-11-13

Graham Fuller has written an illuminating and important book on the relationship between Islam, a religion, and Islamism, a \\"religous-cultural-political framework for engagement on issues.\\" Most Americans, it would seem, associate Muslims with fanatic bomb-throwers. Fuller points out the diversity of Islam and its adherents and examines some of the reasons why Muslim states and political movements are so often failures in the modern world -- when 1,000 years ago they were in the vanguard of civilization. <br /> Amidst many other ideas, Fuller cites, from a UN study, three crisis areas for the Arab world. Lack of political freedom, low level of education, and the low social status of women. He postulates a choice among Islamists. They can continue to ossify or they can find ways to use Islam constructively to confront these crisis areas. This is the challenge of Islam, and the challenge of the U.S. and the West is to help ensure that the choice is the latter and not the former. <br /> In his last chapter, Fuller gives two scenarios for the future. One is dark, foreseeing continued conflict between political Islam and the West; the other is more hopeful. <br /> The best parts of the book in my view are Fuller's insights into what the U.S. might do to encourage the more liberal Islamists. These include a just solution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and support for positive movements in the Islamic world. It hardly seems in the U.S. national interest to have the Muslim world as an antagonist and thus this book is worth a careful reading for its insights and its policy suggestions.	2003-07-01

The old legend has at its core a historical figure: Vlad Tepes, the impaler, a 15th century Transylvanian nobleman noted for making kebabs out of captured Turkish soldiers.<br />  The legend of Dracula will probably outlive the works of Dickens and Tolstoy, but the life of the real Vlad Tepes -- if it could be written -- was probably more interesting than this tepid, late-Victorian novel that takes place mostly in England.  The best part of the book is the first 50 pages: Jonathan Harker's journal of his visit to Transylvania and his frightening encounter with Dracula.  The rest of the book could be condensed by one-half and even then it wouldn't be all that exciting or frightening.<br /><br />  So, read the book because the story of Dracula is hugely important in popular culture -- but don't expect too much.	2003-05-16

After having introducted these two main characters the author abandons his literary pretensions and proceeds thereafter to tell a straight forward -- partly based on fact, partly fictionalized -- tale of the CIA from 1950 to 1991.      <br />       The long search for the mole in the CIA is the heart of the story and it's well done.  But skip the section on Afghanistan.  It just doesn't ring true --the author has too many trees in what is almost a treeless country for one thing.  The moral regeneration of the villain toward the end is mawkish and the account of the sinister, mysterious decades-long KGB plot called KHOLSTHOMER -- which underlies the book from beginning to end -- starts slow and tapers off to nothing.  Don't bother trying to figure KHOLSTHOMER out.     <br />       The two main characters, the Sorcerer and his apprentice, could have been very interesting if the author had focused more on deepening their lives and characters and less on a panoramic view of the CIA.             <br />      Smallchief	2003-04-09

Major Kenneth \\"Killer\\" McCoy, the principal character of this and about 10 others of the Marine Corps series is one of my least favorite.  McCoy is an arrogant, impertinent, know-it-all twerp and just once I would like to seem him get his just desserts of humiliation, humble pie, and a foxhole for life on the front lines.  <br />    So why do I read Griffin?  Because despite his obnoxious characters, he writes about war and the politics of war and he builds a story with lots of interesting details, mixing fact and fiction.  His characters may be incredible, but he spins a mean yarn -- at great length it may be noted, but he's easy reading.  He creates an air of authenticity with his military jargon and his confident descriptions of military culture.     <br />    This is one of his moderately good efforts, about the beginning of the Korean War.  Truman is here as a character and MacArthur -- and Griffin can't seem to make up his mind whether MacArthur is more of a great man or a buffoon, which makes Big Mac interesting.          <br />     I would recommend that the reader start with the first book in the series and then continue reading the series in sequence -- until he can no longer tolerate another word about the detestable Ken McCoy.	2003-02-24

There are some books -- &quot;War and Peace&quot; -- that deserve long, lengthy treatment.  Others are just padded -- and that applies to &quot;Carry the Wind.&quot;  The novel is 700 pages long.  It would be better if the author had cut it back to 400-450 pages.  <br />Well, amidst this over-wordy novel is a good story and a lot of authentic information about the days of the Mountain Men -- ca. 1832 -- perhaps the most heroic and adventurous, although unwashed, characters in American history.  The novel is worth reading for its description of buffalo hunts, Indian fights and homely crafts like moccasin making, beaver skinning, etc. I especially enjoyed the author's description of the Battle of Pierre's Hole, a real event.  <br />The plot of &quot;Carry the Wind&quot; is pretty basic.  Young man (Josiah Paddock) gets in trouble and runs away to the mountains where he meets old trapper (only 38 years old!) &quot;Scratch&quot; also known as Titus Bass.  Old trapper initiates young man into the ways of the Mountain Men.  The ending is pretty exciting although too drawn out by half.

It's beautifully written. As a parent and grandparent, I dreaded reading the inevitable parts about the deaths of children.    <br />But the novel has problems.  First, and not so major, is that the principal character, Anna, is a bit too savvy for her time and place.  Authors often are unable to prevent their 21st century views from creeping into the portrayal of a character born in an earlier century.  I found the philosophical leanings, feminist awakening, and medical insights of this peasant woman of the 17th century too modern and uncredible.      <br />Second, and more importantly, this novel had an implausible and ridiculous ending.  The author loses control of her story about page 290 and goes off into flights of fancy for the last 15 pages of the book.  It's not a bad novel until then.	2003-02-08

The protagonist is Agustine Rejas, a policeman, who hunts down the guerilla leader, Ezequiel. Rejas reminded me of Arkady Renko, Martin Cruz Smith's Russian policeman in \\"Gorky Park\\" and other novels.  He is an honest, decent, incorruptible man, whose virtues are little valued by the society of which he is a part.      <br />Shakespeare tells a compelling story with literary flair and Reyes and the supporting cast, especially the guerilla Ezequiel, are strong, interesting characters.  That is fortunate because the story is seriously marred.  The author, for no good reason, relies heavily on several incredible coincidences to advance his story.  Any hack detective story writer could have come up with a more inventive and believable way to tell his story than Shakespeare does.

I was taught that \\"Heart of Darkness\\" was a metaphorical journey into the darkest heart of man rather than a realistic novel.  Reading \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" I realized that \\"Heart of Darkness\\" has a basis in cold, hard fact -- the brutal regime of King Leopold of Belgium in the Congo from about 1890 to 1910.                  It is often said nowadays that Africa was better off when it was ruled by the European colonial powers.  Hochschild's book will make you question that statement as he piles on example after example of Belgian brutality in the Congo.  Certainly, Africans were killing other Africans and an Arab-operated slave trade existed before the arrival of the Europeans  -- but the \\"civilizing mission\\" of the Europeans is revealed as mostly a scramble for the almighty franc.  Hochschild speculates that ten million people -- half the population -- of the Congo might have died of violence, disease, and mistreatment during King Leopold's rule.   The apt subtitle of the book is \\"A story of greed, terror, and heroism is colonial Africa.\\"           The author finds several possible prototypes for Conrad's fictional character, Kurtz, the colonial official who ornamented the fenceposts around his house with severed human heads.  As Conrad said \\"Heart of Darkness is experience...pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the facts of the case.\\"   The heroes of \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" are the human rights advocates and Protestant missionaries -- mostly British and American -- who brought the brutalities of the Belgian rule to light.                             The last chapter, \\"The Great Forgetting\\" is one of the most interesting.  The author details the efforts of the Belgians and other Europeans to forget, deny, and cover up the records of their abuses in Africa.  \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" is a hard-hitting book that tells a story too little known about the seamier side of imperialism.

Unlike most Hillerman books, which take place in the broad horizons of the Navajo Reservation, \\"Talking God\\" has the slightly amusing spectacle of the two Navajo policeman wandering around Washington D.C. One of them (Leaphorn) is uncomfortably attired in a three piece suit and the other (Chee) wears cowboy boots, blue jeans, bolo tie, and leather jacket -- a bizarre apparition indeed among the paper warriors of the governing tribe. <br /> The novel features a look at Navajo ceremonials, a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the Smithsonian, some insights into the bones-and-stones argument between anthropologists and Indians, a villainous villain, lots of good old fashioned murder and mayhem, a bit of international intrigue, and a riproaring climax as the two Navajos solve the mystery while the FBI, as usual, stands around in a fog.	2003-01-20

He tells of the Anasazi, the ancient ones, an amazing proto-civilization of a thousand years ago that left ruins and potsherds scattered all over the austere, forbidding desert country of the Four Corners area.  The mystery deals with ancient pots, the &quot;thieves of time&quot; who dig up graves and sell the pots they find, and of ambitious archaelogists who strive to make their reputations by discovering the secrets of the Anasazi.<br />       Navajo detectives Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee confront several mysteries: a missing archaeologist, a stolen backhoe, and the bodies of two pot thieves.  For Leaphorn, the solution to the mystery goes back twenty years into his past to a canyon along the San Juan River in Utah.               <br />      Atmosphere is what Hillerman sells in his books and this one has it in abundance.  Navajo culture and ceremonies, modern  police work, and the treasures of the Anasazi are woven together into a landscape of pure, clean-aired natural beauty.  The weather -- thunderstorms, droughts, sudden blizzards, the thunderheads of approaching doom -- is also prominent in Hillerman's novels. His books combine elements of mysteries, westerns, and exotic culture -- and they are really, really worth reading.	2003-01-09

It is fast-paced, easy reading, and balanced.  The author covers all aspects of the war with roughly the emphasis they deserve, shifting back and forth from the high councils of strategy to homely events on the front lines of this brutal, bitter conflict.  <br />&quot;Eagle against the Sun&quot; won't get my highest rating, however, because of its lack of maps.  The inside cover has a general map of the Pacific -- and that's all folks.

Joe Leaphorn.  The murders, it appears, all something to do with witches (skinwalkers).  <br />      \\"Skinwalkers\\" is the seventh book in the Navajo Detective series by Tony Hillerman.  He wrote three books featuring Joe Leaphorn, then three featuring Jim Chee, and now he brings the two policemen together in the same book.  Also, in this book, Hillerman introduces Janet Pete, an agressive Navajo lawyer, as a new love interest for Chee.  Hillerman fans will be interested in this book to see how Leaphorn, methodical and reliable, and Chee, a bit flaky but brilliant, get along working together.  The answer is: uneasily.       <br />      The mystery itself is not overly credible, but weaving the story in and around Navajo beliefs about skinwalkers is fascinating and, as always, Hillerman uses the backdrop of the violent weather and magnificient landscape of the Navajo reservation to frame his story.  And as always Hillerman includes a goodly dose of instruction in Navajo etiquette and attitudes and demonstrates -- usually with good humor -- the ineptness of white policeman, especially the FBI, in the Navajo culture and environment.     <br />       If you haven't read Hillerman before, this is probably not the best book of the series.  He has written more intriguing mysteries.  But the settings of Hillerman's books are fabulous and Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee are top caliber characters worthy of inclusion in a short list of the best detectives in fiction.	2003-01-03

In \\"Ghostway\\" Hillerman explores the conflict of a Navajo drawn to the White world. Jim Chee is in love with a White school teacher, Mary Landon, and he contemplates marrying her and leaving the reservation to take a job as an FBI agent. But he is also pulled in the opposite direction to become a \\"singer\\" and preserve the Navajo ceremonies that are being forgotten as the old timers die off. Chee's preoccupation with the personal choices he must make are always near the surface of this mystery novel. <br /> Hillerman, as always, celebrates the magnificience of the Navajo land and the Navajo's sensitivity to their natural surroundings. And, as always, the knowledge of their land and people give Hillerman's detectives the insight they need to solve the mystery. <br /> \\"Ghostway\\" begins with a shootout in the parking lot of a laundromat in Shiprock, New Mexico that leaves two men dead. The story is not one of Hillerman's best or most credible but the character of Margaret Sosi, an entrancing, 15-year old girl wearing a black pea coat makes up for plot deficiencies. We want this girl to live -- but Hillerman readers know he has cruelly killed off children in other novels in the series. <br /> Hillerman novels contain no sex whatsoever, but \\"Ghostway\\" comes closer than about any other to intimating that Jim Chee and Mary Landon might have engaged in something more than romantic conversation.	2002-12-20

At the Coral Sea in May 1942, the Americans scored their first semi-victory of World War II.  At Midway in June 1942 the Americans stunned the over-confident Japanese by sinking four of their aircraft carriers at the loss of one of their own.       <br />           Willmott's theme is that Japan should have won both battles against an out-numbered and inexperienced American navy, but did not because of woolly strategy and poor planning. At Midway Japan had two objectives: conquer the island and destroy the American fleet.  These objectives should have been reversed in priority.  Moreover, Japan split its superior naval forces into three isolated groups and thus permitted the Americans to meet and fight one of these groups on equal terms.  The Japanese also assumed that the Americans would always do exactly what Japan wanted them to do and were unprepared for surprises.    <br />          The Americans, on their part, had superior intelligence (based on breaking Japanese codes), more durable ships and planes, and good luck.  Willmott illustrates luck in his minute-by-minute examination of the mishaps of the Japanese in locating the American fleet at Midway. First, mechanical problems delayed the dispatch of a scout plane for half an hour and, next, the pilot inexplicably lingered near the American fleet for an hour before he reported the presence of carriers, an oversight that paralyzed the Japanese when they should have been attacking.  As a result, American bombers scored first -- and decisive -- strikes against the Japanese carriers.    But, Midway was a very near thing!  41 American torpedo bombers attacked in the first wave --  and only five came home again.            <br />        Willmott, a Brit, is opinionated and in the course of 500 pages, he makes some judgments I found questionable.  For example, he seems to think it would have been a goodidea for the Japanese navy to invade the Indian ocean and expel the British. That seems like a very bad idea.  In my opinion, after the fall of Singapore in February 1942, Japan's overwhelming priority should have been to destroy the American aircraft carriers in the Pacific- but Japan dithered with raids on Ceylon and Australia and invasions of New Guinea.  The delay proved to be fatal.  <br />         This is a good book for those whose interests go toward detailed examination of the thought processes of military planners and the battlefield decisions of leaders in charge of ships, planes, and men.  Willmott probes deeply and provocatively into the calculations and miscalculations of men at war.	2002-12-16

The maps in this book, to use a adjective favored by my grandchildren,[are bad].  Prange's prose is dense and detailed and the absence of good maps limits the ability of the reader to understand him.<br />  This is a good book -- maybe the best about Midway, the most important battle of the Pacific War.  People these days seem to forget that in 1942, Americans were probably more worried about Japan than they were about Germany.<br />  Prange tells the story of Midway from both the Japanese and the American side.  The insights from military leaders -- now virtually all dead -- make this an irreplacable source of information on the battle.  I suggest a new deluxe edition of this book -- rewritten in places to improve the comprehensibility of the prose and with detailed maps, timelines, a glossary of military terms, and more photos of the battle and the equipment in use.  I would like to see, for example, photos of the many different aircraft participating in the battle.	2002-12-08

The author's questionable claims in his account of Custer's Last Stand made me wonder how accurate the rest of the book is.  For example, he estimated that 10,000 Sioux and Cheyenne warriors were  arrayed against Custer.  That is a vast exaggeration.  I would believe an Indian army of 2,000 -- maybe even 3,000 -- but 10,000?  No. Not possible. Also, the author overestimates Indian casualties.  He mentions \\"hundreds of dead and dying\\" Indians in one minor sub-battle of the engagement. No. Hollywood to the contrary, Indians had a well-developed sense of self-preservation and rarely pressed an attack in which they suffered heavy casualties. The evidence from Indian sources and on the battleground -- the most thoroughly studied of any in the world -- is that the Indians sustained only moderate casualties -- far fewer than the 250 dead of Custer.                   There's too much good writing on war to bother reading this book.	2002-12-08

As an American I can't judge how authentic her books may be to an English reader, but I detect in them an American expansiveness --- this one is 709 pages long.                 \\"In Pursuit....\\" is about two murders on an English moor and the investigation to catch the killer or killers.   The merit -- and the mystery -- in the story is which of two Scotland Yard detectives is pursuing the line of investigation that will lead to solving the case.  Detective number one is Thomas Lynley -- elegant, privileged, earnest, respected, of noble heritage and the owner of a Bentley automobile which he loves almost as much as he loves his upper-crust wife. Detective number two is Barbara Havers, a dumpy, working-class slob with the personality of a bulldog and an appetite for pop tarts and cigarettes.  She uses her t-shirt for a napkin and does not have a Bentley -- or a flourishing social life.                      Lynley and Havers have different notions as to the motives and the perpetrators of the murders on the moors and they embark on parallel -- and competitive -- investigations.  I didn't really care much about solving the mystery; rather I cared about who won the match between Lynley and Havers.  Which one will you root for?  A compilation of the answers to that question from English and American readers would be interesting.                George is a good plotter and pacer and a decent writer and this one kept my interest to the end despite its formidable length.  George can be spoken of in the same breath as P.D. James, the reigning queen of British whodunits.    Smallchief	2002-11-18

If you're interested in ancient Egypt or historical fiction, give this one a miss.  The story is simplistic -- about on the level of a Nancy Drew mystery -- with bits of exotic culture and supernatural conjuring thrown in to let you know that you've been transported back to the Land of the Pharaohs.        The author is described on the book jacket as a \\"respected Egyptologist\\" but I found little \\"Egyptology\\" in this book that could not have been acquired by a college student through casual reading. Change the names and take out a few references to exotic gods and the Nile and this story could be placed in any era and any country of the world. Indeed, one is struck by how similar the ancient Egypt of this book is to modern governments. Ramses, Pharaoh of Egypt, is presented as a man of twenty-first century sensitivities. An accurate portrayal of ancient Egypt? I don't think so. The author fails to divorce himself from the present and conjure up a credible vision of ancient Egypt.    Smallchief	2002-11-18

Thus, Hillerman sets the scene for his story, the fifth in the Navajo Detectives series and the second with Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police as the main character. \\"Dark Wind\\" weaves into the story the religious ceremonies of the gentle Hopi Indians and the antipathy between village Hopi and sheep-herding Navajo.  The story is overlaid by the natural splendor of the country and Chee's knowledge of his people and land are crucial to resolving the mystery, while the Federals - the FBI and the DEA - thrash around ineffectively    Hillerman has professed to be a little uncomfortable with his creation, Jim Chee, a young man with a stubborn, rebellious streak, one foot in the Navajo world and the other in the White man's. Chee demonstrates those characteristics in \\"Dark Wind\\" and is less likeable as a character than in other books in the series.           \\"Dark Wind\\" is a good tale -- but not the best of the series -- with a lot of intriguing insights into Hopi and Navajo folkways and philosophy.

In the first three books Lt. Joe Leaphorn is the main character.  \\"People of Darkness\\" introduces Sgt. Jim Chee, a younger and more complex man who is torn between the white man's world - and a career in the FBI - and the Navajo way as a \\"singer\\" or shaman.  Also introduced in this book is an appealing, peaches-and-cream Wisconsin girl, Mary Landon, as a mild love interest for Chee. <br />A bomb goes off in a hospital parking lot, apparently aimed at killing a man who is already dying of cancer, a box containing little of apparent value disappears from a rich man's house, and an oil well explosion thirty years back has some connection to these events.  This is vintage Hillerman: a story than ranges over vast areas of time and space.  The villain in \\"People of Darkness\\" is one of Hillerman's best: a cold professional with the vulnerability of a battered child.    <br />Hillerman's strengths are authenticity and atmosphere. Elements of Navajo culture, religion, and folkways are woven into the fabric of his novels. His landscapes are harsh and spectacular. Nature is magnificent, but also menacing. In this exotic setting, the supernatural seems almost possible and little chilly fingers tickle your spine. If you are an urbanite, you may not like Hillerman; but if you are drawn to big, blank spots on the map you will likely love him. Not the least of his accomplishments is that he has probably taught more people about the Navajo -- and generated more interest in Navajo culture -- than any other writer.	2002-11-01

The search for answers takes him to the remote canyon country along the Arizona-Utah border.    <br />This is the third novel in Hillerman's masterpiece series.  The star of the show, Joe Leaphorn, is a likeable, honest, methodical man with a compulsion to find out the truth.  Hillerman's strengths are authenticity and atmosphere.  Navajo culture, religion, and folkways are woven into the fabric of his novels. His landscapes are harsh and spectacular. Nature is magnificent, but also menacing. In this exotic setting, the supernatural seems almost possible and little chilly fingers tickle your spine.   <br />Leaphorn, something of a passive investigator in the first two novels of the series, is an action figure in \\"Listening Woman,\\" confronting several ultra-violent killers.  Hillerman allows his characters to grow and adds and subtracts characters as he goes along in the series.  Captain Largo, Leaphorn's sardonic boss, makes his first appearance in this book.     <br />\\"Listening Woman\\" suffers slightly from an ending drawn from action movies rather than real life, but it's a top quality mystery/western nevertheless.

I've seen a lot of John Wayne movies, but knew little about the man until I read this book.  This is a thorough, well-researched, and well-written book about his life. I don't think you can help liking the big lug, despite his many faults.  He was loyal to his friends, honest, well-meaning, and a hard worker at his craft of acting.<br />  The biggest negative about Wayne is that he didn't serve in the military during World War II.  The authors go into the reasons and don't spare him criticism.  Wayne was undoubtedly more important to the war effort as a maker of patriotic movies than he would have been carrying a rifle - but that doesn't excuse him.  He was the original chicken-hawk - a species that is proliferating these days.<br />  I also found the material interesting about the ideological struggle in Hollywood between right and left in the late 1940s and 1950s.  We hear a lot a criticism about \\"black lists\\" and Hollywood types boycotted because they were leftists; this book points out that the leftists also had their fangs out to bring down the rightists like Wayne.  That he came out on top, despite his unpopular political stances, is a tribute to his honesty and stubborn inflexibility - similar to the characters he played.<br />  I doubt that any other movie star is so distinctive in walk and talk - or more deserving of a good biography.  I enjoyed the book - and I look forward to reading more about John Wayne someday in a book which will probe even deeper into his life, career, and psyche.  Wayne was an American original.	2002-10-19

It concerns the murder or disppearance of two boys, a Navajo and a Zuni, and Joe Leaphorn's efforts to find the missing boys.  The riddle is entwined with Zuni religious ceremonies which Leaphorn, a Navajo, tries to understand.       <br />    Hillerman gives a virtual travelogue of the Zuni and Navajo country of New Mexico and Arizona in the early 1970s when the book was written.  Leaphorn is a thoroughly likeable hero, rational, even-tempered, and ethical with a compulsion to get to the bottom of things.  Hillerman is a master of creating an exotic atmosphere of Zuni and Navajo culture and ceremonies overlaid by the splendor of the natural setting.  With such ornament, it hardly matters that the solution to the mystery itself is not very convincing.         <br />What a great title! If you're a wide-open-spaces-kind-of-a-person Hillerman is unbeatable as a mystery writer with a western twist.  In Joe Leaphorn he has created a fictional detective who can take his place among the all-time best.	2002-10-07

For those of us who have read a bit about the Civil War there is nothing new, different, or outstanding about this book.

The book spreads itself across many fields:  evolution, sex, language and arts, geography, war, and environment<br /> The author postulates that man was just a third species of chimpanzee until about 40,000 years ago when he made a \\"great leap forward\\" to become a chattering, tool-using animal who came to dominate the world.  Why that great leap forward took place is unknowable, but the author speculates that the development of language was the catalyst.<br />\\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" is written in a light style with lots of intriguing speculations and theories mixed amongst the facts.  The author leads with that most fascinating of subjects - sex - and spends about 50 pages examining the sex lives of man and his primate relatives in voyeuristic detail. After hooking the reader on sex, the author goes on to more prosaic topics such as the spread of Indo-European languages, the geographical factors that influence history, and even a bit of speculation about intelligent life in the universe.

This sort of speculation would have been interesting from a writer of talent such as Mr. Tsouras.  <br /> Instead, what the author has produced is a speculative novel, in which fiction is woven seamlessly in with fact and it is left to the reader to determine which is which.  I became impatient with trying to sort out what was fact and what was fiction and gave up.  In his quest to confuse the reader, the author has even included fictional footnotes from fictional books.   <br /> Some who enjoy speculative fiction might like this book.

To defeat Pablo it was necessary to kill him.  He was too powerful in Colombia to be suppressed by legal means.  What should a government do when it is faced with a merciless gang?  Is it ever moral for a government to sanction the murder of its citizens?  Is the struggle against a powerful criminal gang akin to a war in which killing political opponents is \\"fair play?\\" Is an employee or family member of an evil man a fair target? The author reports the facts as he discovered them and doesn't express a clear opinion, but his story of Pablo's killing makes you ponder right and wrong.      <br /> The author constructed \\"Killing Pablo\\" by interviewing participants.  The story is necessarily one-sided as so many of its characters ended up dead.  The actions of the Colombian and U.S. governments in ridding the world of Pablo Escobar will be applauded by some and deplored by others.   Read the book and make up your own mind.

Lee surrendered his army to U.S. Grant, and the Civil War ended. The author contends that - but for the wisdom of Lincoln, Lee, Grant, and a few others - the South might have elected to wage guerrilla war with disastrous consequences for the reunification of these United States. <br /> \\"April 1865\\" reminds us that Lee was the commander of only one of several Confederate armies in the field and that delicate negotiations were required to halt hostilities across the length and breadth of the country. Lee and Grant set the tone for the surrender and the commanders of other armies followed suit - but this satisfactory end was by no means inevitable. Southern armies might have taken to the hills to continue the fight. The author also raises the interesting question as to why the U.S. was able to reunite as a country after a civil war when so many countries have not. <br /> In many of its details \\"April 1865\\" is fascinating. But there is a thin line between what the author calls \\"vivid writing\\" and excessive writing, and he erred on the side of excess at times, thereby damaging the credibility of his analysis. He would profit from Mark Twain's advice about adjectives, \\"kill most of them...They weaken when they are close together. They give strength when they are wide apart.\\" <br />The greatest virture of \\"April 1865\\" is probably its description of lesser known events, including the emancipation movement in the South, Johnson's surrender to Sherman, and Forrest's renunciation of guerrilla war. This is a worthwhile book about the end of the Civil War.	2002-09-14

Published in 1970, this is the first in the series, introducing Joe Leaphorn, who will become well and favorably known in subsequent novels.      <br />       Witches are about in the Navajo country and Leaphorn -- the most rational of men -- perceives a connection between the tales of the witches and the murder of a young Navajo. Strange things occur: the throats of sheep are slashed, men dressed in wolfskins are seen, a hat is stolen, all of this leading to a confrontation in a cliff dwelling and a chase on a high desert plateau.    <br />       This is not the best novel of the series. Some of the deeds of a mild-mannered college professor fleeing the \\"witches\\" seem improbable.  And Leaphorn is not yet fully developed as a unique character and master detective. But \\"Blessing Way\\" is a strong beginning to what would become a masterpiece series.         <br />     Hillerman's strengths are authenticity and atmosphere.   Elements of Navajo culture, religion, and folkways are woven into the fabric of his novels. His landscapes are harsh and spectacular.  Nature is magnificient, but also menacing. In this exotic setting, the supernatural seems almost possible and little chilly fingers tickle your spine.  If you are a urbanite, you may not like Hillerman; but if you are drawn to big, blank spots on the map you will likely love him. Not the least of his accomplishments is that he has probably taught more people about the Navajo -- and generated more interest in Navajo culture -- than any other writer.	2002-08-28

He tells a good story with a high standard of accuracy. I doubt that anyone has ever written a better account of the most-written about event in American history.<br />Two facts about Foote's history. First, the focus is on the South. Foote spends more time on Jefferson Davis than he does on Abraham Lincoln. The Southern generals are more lovingly drawn than the northerners. Secondly, Foote gives more space than the typical historian to the war in the West, as befits his own ancestry as a Mississipian. Vicksburg gets almost equal time with Gettysburg and Foote avoids the Virginia-itis of so many Civil War historians.<br />The long chapter on Gettysburg is considered by many to be the centerpiece of the three volumes, but I keep returning to Foote's tale of the masterful Second Manassas campaign, pages 585-649, Volume I. The most regrettable omission of the book is the short shrift Foote gives to the assault by Negro troops on Fort Wagner, South Carolina (page 697-698, Volume 2). (See the movie \\"Glory.\\") Surely, this battle deserves more attention for its human interest quality, if not its military significance. The most fascinating character is the \\"Wizard of the Saddle,\\" Nathan Bedford Forrest. The South didn't want to win badly enough to give Forrest, an evil genius, a major command until late in the war. One wonders what might have happened if he had been in command at Perryville or Vicksburg.<br />This is a book that will always occupy a prominent place on my bookshelf. My only regret is that it isn't longer. I usually complain about books being too long, but 3,000 pages isn't enough to tell the tale of the Civil War. More! More!	2002-08-16

He has too many generals going in too many directions all at once and I had some trouble keeping up with him.  Better maps would have helped.  He has about a dozen in the book, but they are all as busy as a Jackson Pollack painting.<br />This is not a book for the casual reader but a long, meticulously researched study of command by Union and Confederate generals in the Gettysburg campaign.  Coddington's conclusions are a bit murky and lost in 600 pages of densely written prose, but I think he gives higher marks to Meade, the Union commander, than most other chroniclers.  My view had been that Robert E. Lee, the southern commander, lost the battle through over-confidence.  Lee believed -- erroneously it turned out -- he could break the Union forces and they would run as they had on several previous occasions.  Coddington would agree in part that Lee lost the battle, but he also gave Meade credit for good leadership and suggested that the Union generals were equal to the Southerners.  Certainly, Meade deserves praise for occupying the best ground, holding shorter, interior lines, keeping his head, and avoiding the debacles of Generals Hooker, Burnside, et al.<br />One could read Coddington a second and a third time to gain understanding of the most important battle in American history - because if Lee had won at Gettysburg the South would probably have won its independence and Abraham Lincoln would have been about as well regarded a President as Millard Fillmore. I think, however, that I prefer more accessible accounts of Gettysburg, such as Shelby Foote's 170 page account of the campaign in his history of the Civil War. Coddington, I will admire from a distance, awed by his scholarship and consulting him on occasion - but unlikely to have the fortitude to reread his scholarly masterpiece.	2002-08-07

It's certainly an above average novel in the \\"family saga\\" genre, even though I can't get quite as rapturous as many of the reviewers. <br /> McCullough fits the cliche of \\"born storyteller.\\" She puts a lot of words down on paper, spinning the yarn out a long, long time and with no small amount of extraneous stuff. For example, she devotes at least one hundred pages to the lives of Justine and Dane when what we really want to know is what happens to Meggie and Ralph -- the ill-fated lovers who dominate the book.<br /> I don't find the love story of Meggie and Ralph all that compelling -- although it will keep you turning the pages. The real merit of \\"The Thorn Birds\\" is the vivid picture it gives of life on a sheep station in the Australian outback before about 1950 when life there became electrified and telephoneified, and more or less the same as everywhere else. <br /> \\"Thorn Birds\\" would be better if it were cut down to about 500 pages from the present 700. It seriously falters when the emphasis shifts from the outback to the theater in London and the Vatican in Rome. These are dime-a-dozen stories, but life in the outback, now that's a tale worth telling! And the author does it well.	2002-08-02

This is the story of a run for the Presidency by a moderately liberal, goody-good senator.  The only non-cliche in the book is that he is from Georgia -- not usually considered a spawner of liberal democrats.  <br />    As usual, the villains are right-wing militia types. (Ho, hum, can't somebody come up with better bad-guys these days?)  There are a lot of unexplained coincidences in the book.  The huge political secret in American politics that underlies the plot happens to be known inexplicably by a federal prisioner in Georgia -- and just about everybody else.  The hero has several miraculous escapes from death and political defeat and I´ll let you guess the ending....<br />       Woods to give him credit writes a tight tale and creates a certain amount of suspense.

If you haven´t already read them, I suggest you read the Smiley trilogy which begins with &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; -- one of the great masterpieces of the last century in my humble opinion.  &quot;Our Game&quot; by contrast is good -- not great. <br />       One of the problems is that the characters aren't very appealing.  Tim is an insufferable public-school Englishman about whose fate we care nil plus the square root of zero. Larry is a professor who´s committment to the downtrodden of the world seems an ego trip, the female lead is an airheaded artist who doesn´t seem to merit the sort of admiration she gets.  <br />       But the subject matter is interesting.  Who ever heard of the Ingush people until Le Carre wrote about them?  His portayal of them is superb: the downtrodden ethnic groups of the former Soviet Union asseting themselves brutally, stupidly, unsuccesfully, but with doomed courage and dedication. &quot;Our Game&quot; is kind of thin gruel compared to Le Carre´s great cold war novels, but it´s worth a read.	2002-07-18

That sounds bizarre but it works for the most part. Walker is a better-than-average writer who tells a fascinating -- though not quite compelling -- story.        <br />The centerpiece of the story is a cave painting 17,000 years old.  The author creates a rarity -- a plausible pre-historic culture and society -- with one flaw: a liberated female character who belongs to the present rather than the past.  <br />The painting shows up one day on the desk of an art dealer in London and in attempting to trace its origin she journeys to the Dordogne region of France where she becomes immersed in the nearly-forgotten history of the French Resistance of World War II.  The best part of the book is Walker's account of the Resistance and the struggles between the Gaullists and the Communists.  I could have read a lot more about the Resistance and wish that this part of the novel had been longer.                           <br />The book was successful in raising my interest about the cave paintings and the remote region of France where they are located.  Had the ending been a little stronger, the mystery a little more mysterious, it would have been an outstanding -- rather than just a very good -- novel.	2002-06-27

War With Mexico, 18461848	Books	5	16	20	N	N	Best History of Mexican-American War	I like it that nowhere in this book is it mentioned that the author is the son of President Eisenhower.  The book is presented on its own merits -- and it's a good book, the best I have found about our fascinating and momentous war with Mexico in 1846-1847.  Eisenhower lacks flash and dash as an author.  The virtues of the book are reliability, thoroughness, lack of obvious bias, good maps, and illustrations.  <br />Mexico could have won this war.  They outnumbered the Americans two in one in nearly every battle.  American artillery and aggressiveness combined with abysmal Mexican leadership won the war.  President Polk impresses as a man I wouldn't want to play poker with. Zachary Taylor-- a future President -- was a good, no-nonsense general.  Winfield Scott was something of a military genius.  His expedition from Veracuz on the coast to capture Mexico City (remember the line? &quot;in the halls of Montezuma.&quot;) duplicated the feat of Cortes three centuries earlier.  In covering the whole war in one volume, Eisenhower misses some of the drama of this bold and brilliant expedition.  Among the Mexicans, alas, are no admirable characters -- except for the long-suffering, misled common soldiers who fought bravely.  Santa Anna dominates and he was a charlatan. <BR>  <BR>One of the most interesting features of the Mexican war is the participation as junior officers of soldiers who would become famous in the Civil war.  Captain Robert E. Lee was a hero in this war as an engineer and scout.  Grant, Meade, McClellan, Stonewall Jackson, Beauregard and a host of others appear in cameo roles.   <br />The timeless lament of the Mexicans is &quot;Poor Mexico: so far from God and so close to the United States.&quot;  But then again, Mexico is the &quot;colossus of the north&quot; when you look at it from the point of view of the countries in Central America.	2002-06-20

It's a panorama of life in China as seen by an American missionary from 1906 until the 1950s.  The author was the son of a China missionary and most of the events in the book are historical -- althought the main character, Treadup, is fictional -- a composite of sorts for all the missionaries in China. &quot;The Call&quot; achieves a feeling of absolute authenticity.<br />  This is a long exhaustive book.  The first hundred pages or so are devoted in Treadup's early life in upstate New York and the reader may be forgiven if he is impatient with the plodding pace.  The story picks up when Treadup gets to China as it details his adventures, doubts, and misteps, all worked into the political and social framework of the time.  Treadup's journeys -- both physical and spiritual -- are long and arduous and ultimately this is a sad book.<br />  Missionaries are out of fashion these days, but their cause -- the spread of Western civilization -- is still alive.  If he lived today, Treadup would not be a missionary, but rather an activist for Tibetan independence, a friend of Bono, a board member of Amnesty International, and a tireless crusader against gender inequality. Will today's secular &quot;missionaries&quot; succeed where Treadup failed?<br />  I don't know of any other novel that probes more deeply and seriously into the life, times, and mind of a China missionary.  We live intimately with Treadup and when his life is over, we wonder, as he did, whether it was all worth it.	2002-06-17

Carter republishes and annotates Carson's laconic autobiography of adventures as a fur trapper, mountain man, indian fighter, soldier, and explorer. Carson went from being an illiterate saddlers's apprentice in 1825 to one of the famous men in America by the end of his life in 1868. A small, unprepossessing man, he never learned to read or write, never made any money, and was  modest, even ashamed of his fame. Arguably, Carson lived through more adventures than anyone else in American history.    <br />Carter admires his subject which is good because Kit Carson is sometimes portrayed these days as a monstrous genocidiare because of his role in defeating the Navajos and forcing them to move to a reservation on which many of them died. In reality, Carson was a relatively humane soldier who often defended the rights of the Indians and who became a good agent on their behalf. But, unlettered and overly impressed by the authority, judgments, and education of his superiors, Carson didn't possess the moral courage and confidence to challenge his orders to suppress the Navajos.   <br /> Carter's research into Carson's life is thorough. He employs the unusual technique of publishing Carson's autobiography as written and commenting on it in extensive footnotes. Some might find this irritating as your eyes must move from text to footnote constantly. Carter also publishes a large collection of photographs of Carson, examines his fame, and extolls his virtues.<br /> To my mind, Kit Carson is the premier hero of the western expansion of the U.S. Carter's book is one of the most accurate and well-researched accounts of Carson's remarkable life.	2002-06-05

That's what this book is about: meetings -- innumerable, endless meetings in a small village in revolutionary China. For three years (1946-1948, it seems that the peasants in this village met every day to discuss how to divvy up the land taken from the landlords, select their leaders, discuss the correct \\"line\\" of the revolution, criticize each other, and punish evil doers.<br />Hinton is an enthusiast for Chairman Mao and the communists, but he doesn't gloss over the excesses of the revolution. He paints a vivid picture of life in prerevolutionary China and an equally vivid picture of the implementation of Maoism in the countryside with all its violence, doctrinal hair-splitting, changes in direction, and imperfections. At the end of the book, he concludes that the peasants and the revolution have achieved a proper balance between equity and production in the Chinese countryside and presumably everyone will live happily ever after.<br />As a story about life in the countryside this book is outstanding. As a book about the makings of a revolution at the peasant level it is outstanding. As a book about land reform and Maoism, it is much, much less than prophetic. Hinton leaves us with a warm, post revolutionary feeling that all was well in the Chinese countryside in 1948. But all was not well. Tens of millions of Chinese peasants starved to death in the 1950s. Maybe they were spending too much time in revolutionary meetings and not enough time working in their fields. Revolutionary enthusiasts such as Hinton need to be called to account for the errors they make in their ardor and naivete. Perhaps we should have a meeting on that....	2002-06-03

Unfortunately, the author didn't have the imagination to come up with an extraordinary, unexpected, knockout conclusion. Instead, he hemmed and hawed for the last hundred or so pages while he tried desperately to find a satisfactory ending to the book -- and failed miserably. <br />The good points are that the book is well-written, the story line intriguing, and the mystery is mysterious enough to keep you reading -- albeit with increasing and well justified suspicion that the author has nothing to say and is saying so at great length. I'll give the book three stars because I learned something about Dumas and demonology and the antiquarian book trade.	2002-06-03

I avidly read his books about exploration in the Gobi and China.  But Andrews faded away into obscurity over the years.  This book revives his memory.<br />For a reader unfamiliar with Andrews this book might be rated outstanding.  For me, familiar with the outlines of his life, it was only good, not imparting enough new information.  For example, a fascinating fact about Andrews is the animosity his colleagues at the American Museum of Natural History had for him.  The best example of this animosity is that when Andrews died in 1960, the Museum did not even acknowledge the death of its most famous employee and former Director in any Museum publication.  This snub to Andrews is somewhat akin to the TV networks failing to report the death of Walter Cronkite, when and if he passes into the hereafter.  Why such hatred and spite toward Andrews, a personable, outgoing, charismatic leader?  Who were those in the Museum who held a grudge against him and why? The author doesn't cover this topic adequately, leaving unanswered questions in my mind.  <br />Thus, while this book is well worth reading, there remain facets of Andrew's life still closed and mysterious.  But this book does a fine job of reviving recognition of Andrews who was famous in his day. He deserves the acclaim.	2002-05-10

If the two were woven together into a single fabric, this would be a good book, but it isn't. You read a passage describing some aspect on Jesus's life and suddenly you find a few pages about the excavation of a Roman bath.  Moreover, much of the text isn't really about Jesus but ranges far back and far forward.  The idea of examining archaelogical and textual material in the same book may have been good, but the execution is lousy.  The works of two different authors are interspaced -- not integrated.  <br />      I thought also that Crossan, one of the authors, was too anxious to contradict the bible.  Crossan seems to question the validity of the bible more than he questions the truth of his other written sources.  A little more balance would be better.   <br />      I found myself skipping many sections of this book which didn't interest me to find a few sections which are very good. The book tends to get better, and more relevant to the life of Jesus, toward the end.  This book might be used as a reference to be dipped into on occasion, rather than a narrative to be read from beginning to end.	2002-05-01

That's faint praise because the definitive history of this turning point in American military fortunes has not yet been written. <br />     Guadalcanal was the first American ground offensive of World War II against a Japanese army that had swept aside all opposition and a Japanese navy that had been beaten at Midway but still had parity in numbers and advantage in experience over the Americans.  Several thousand young, untested marines were dumped on this big jungle island, abandoned by the Navy and left to fight nearly by themselves.  Fortunately for them, Japanese strategy and tactics were self-deluding and, frankly, stupid.      <br />      Leckie gives a competent account of the 6-month long battle, bringing a lot of color into his story, and introducing himself into the text unobtrusively on several occasions.  (He was a machinegunner on Guadalcanal.) But the maps in the book could be better; his explanations are sometimes hard to follow; and his descriptions of the hardships and horrors of battle on Guadalcanal could be improved upon. <br />       I've read other books with more facts about Guadalcanal, although Leckie is good at eye-witness detail. But Guadalcanal was a epic struggle and deserves an epic of its own.  Some might find it in the novel and movie, &quot;The Thin Red Line.&quot;	2002-04-24

Everybody who has reviewed this book has given it high marks which tells me that everyone who has read it agrees with what O'Rourke has to say.  A liberal would give it one star and attack it and his review would be worth reading if it was intelligently written -- an oxymoron, O'Rourke might say.       <br />O'Rourke travels to some of the least savory places of the world to contemplate the ills of mankind and he finds, to his surprise, that he rather likes some people he meets -- Vietnamese and Haitians -- and he comes up with a semi-hopeful scenario for mankind.  Al Gore, who was Vice President when this book was written, is the chief butt of his jokes, as are gray-suited UN office-sitters and environmental hand-wringers.  In debunking the doom-sayers, O'Rourke cites a profound principle: \\"Getting facts right is a fundamental requirement of morality.\\" He excoriates Gore et al for their free and loose violation of that principle.  <br />Well, if your expectations aren't too high, you can be satisfied with this world.

Bruce Chilton, the author, tells us that everything Jesus did was \\"as a Jew, for Jews, and about Jews.\\"   Jesus, he says, was a short, plump, balding, illiterate, revolutionary rabbi whose objective was to purify Judaism in the expectation that God would then reward the Israelites by expelling the unclean Romans and other Gentiles from their land.   This suggests that Jesus would be appalled if he had known that the fruit of his labor was to be the creation of a new religion: Christianity.     <br /> Chilton has written a fascinating and controversial biography of Jesus.  I'm not an expert and, thus, I don't have the background to judge whether this book should be taken seriously or considered a work of surmise and imagination.  Chilton accepts some parts of the biblical account of Jesus' life as factual and rejects others as fabricated or inaccurate.  His authority for deciding what is true and what is untrue is often uncertain - as is his reasoning.  <br /> The book was worth reading, however, for the vivid picture Chilton paints of life in the Roman provinces of what we call the Holy Land.   One of the best passages is in Chapter 11 in which Chilton describes the Great Temple of Jerusalem and the barbaric - I guess everyone was a barbarian in those days -- animal sacrifices carried out by the high priests.  But Jesus protested against adherence to the rituals which the priests demanded - and profited from.  Chilton's Jesus makes a quantum leap forward in religious philosophy by believing that \\"purity\\" comes from inside a person, rather than through sterile observance of a ritual, form, or formality of religion.  That, at least, is my interpretation of what the author is trying to convey of Jesus' philosophy.  As a speculative history this book is outstanding; better informed persons than me will have to judge its accuracy and religious merits.	2002-04-08

You won't learn much new if you've read or seen any of the numerous books or movies on this subject, but Parker's spare, laconic style gives a savory flavor to this retelling of the tale. If Parker had gotten deeper into the story and characters, this would have been better, but then I suppose it wouldn't have been a Parker book.           <br /> Parker portrays the events in Tombstone as a struggle between northerners (Earps) and southerners, townspeople (Earps) and cowboys, people who come at you \\"straight\\" (Earps) and those who don't, and the rivalry for a woman (Josie Marcus) between Wyatt Earp and Sheriff Johnny Behan.  Wyatt Earp and other admirable characters, notably Johnny Ringo, are adherents to an unshakeable code of loyalty to family and friends.  There's no room for compromise with this code.  Wyatt and Ringo admire each other but their ties of family and friends force them to take different sides of the quarrel.

He surveys the prelude to the American revolution as seen by John Adams (who dominates the book), Benjamin Franklin, British General Thomas Gage, and George Washington. The story Shaara tells begins in 1770 and ends shortly after July 4, 1776.    <br />     The first half of this book was slow. Shaara didn't inject much new life into the familiar stories of the Boston Massacre, Boston Tea Party, etc. The novel began to pick up momentum with Paul Revere's ride and the entry into the story of the Virginians: George Washington, TJ, Patrick Henry, and a couple of Lees.  But the most enlightening part of the novel for me was Benjamin Franklin's visit to Ireland where he observes the horrible poverty and desolation in spirit of the Irish and realizes that the same fate is in store for the Americans if they remain under English rule.            <br />       I read this book with impatience because this is just the prelude to what will (hopefully) be a much more exciting Shaara book about the Revolutionary War in which Washington, Benedict Arnold, and other characters come to the fore.  I look forward to the sequel.	2002-03-30

I barely made it through the first self-indulgent chapter.  Urged to read on, I continued and the book improved -- although not a whole lot. <br />     I enjoyed the chapters on &quot;The Crisis in French Cooking&quot; and &quot;The World Cup.&quot;  Most of the rest was pretty dull.  The author found great meaning in commonplace events.  I didn't.    His view of France is elitist and intellectual. I would have been more interested if he had interviewed French customers at McDonalds in Paris -- or American tourists wearing shorts and carrying cameras.  <br />       A hilarious feature of &quot;Paris to the Moon&quot; is &quot;Questions for Discussion&quot; at the back of the book.  Seven serious questions are asked of the reader -- just as if he were a college sophomore taking a test in literature!   The presumption is, of course, that what he has just finished reading is worthy of discussion.  What a hoot!  The guy who thought of this should be assigned to guard duty on the Maginot Line -- or a week-long seminar on French culture.               <BR> <BR>      Despite all, Gopnik is a likeable fellow and a good writer and &quot;Paris to the Moon&quot; is marginally worth reading	2002-03-25

U.S. President James Polk crafted a deal with England for Oregon and Washington and launched a war with Mexico for California and the Southwest. <br /> The largest part of the book deals with the war with Mexico -- but the best book on this subject is \\"So Far From God\\" by John S.D. Eisenhower. Rather than a historian of war, DeVoto is a sort of Homer of the West, extolling the feats of his company of heros. He's opinionated, arrogant, sometimes obnoxious, sometimes too clever to be tolerated, but he's turned out an epic of American empire here. It's not a balanced book. DeVoto doesn't waste many kind words on Mexicans, Indians, or Eastern intellectuals. The good guys are the mountain men, the uncouth, unlettered men who led the American charge across the great plains into the western mountains. Example: while Thoreau was extolling the virtues of self reliance on Walden Pond, about a mile from Concord, Massachusetts, Kit Carson rode a horse from California to Washington, D.C. -- and then turned around and rode back again. The mountain men are formidable. <br /> This is not an easy book to read as DeVoto makes demands on the reader to remember a great number of characters participating in the complex threads of multiple movements. But its possibly the best book I've ever read about Americans going west.	2002-03-20

It might have been a great book had Che been a living, breathing character, rather than being seen only from afar.   <br />     Griffin seems tired of his old military heros, the best of whom is Craig Lowell, who is brave, good-looking, intelligent, irresistible to women, and filthy rich.  Somehow, despite all that, you still like Craig, whose shortcomings are that he's always in trouble and gets more medals than he does promotions.  He is still around in this book, but Griffin focuses on a younger group of soldiers who are only only bleary, second-rate copies of the original Craig Lowell.        <br />    Griffin's strong point has been the authenticity he has been able to bring to U.S. military culture.  However, in &quot;Special Ops&quot; Griffin seems to have pulled out of a hat all his old literary tricks and reused them, changing the characters and the scenes a bit but relying on the tried and true -- and the now trite for readers familiar with his other books. Moreover, he makes mistakes, probably due to haste, as other reviewers have pointed out.   <br />     Don't read this book.  Read the first book in Griffin's  series, &quot;The Lieutenants&quot; or the first book in his Marine Corps series, &quot;Semper Fi.&quot;  At his best, Griffin is a great writer about war and the U.S. military, but &quot;Special Ops&quot; is not one of his best books.	2002-03-15

Spies, the making of the first atomic bomb, and fascinating historical characters combine to make this potentially one of the great mystery/ suspense novels.  Alas, it is not.  The book collapses into implausibility and irrelevance.  <BR>      On the subject of implausibility -- hopefully not giving away much of the (weak) plot -- the hero Mike Connolly just happens to meet by coincidence every key figure in the plot early on in the book. This is a hard pill to swallow when one figures that several thousand people worked at Los Alamos.  Coincidence happens -- but not over and over and over again. <BR>      On the question of irrelevance, one assumes that the book is building up to a dramatic conclusion involving spy rings, national security, and villains of consequence.  It's not. It's building up to a sordid little scandal -- unworthy of the setting and the promise of the book.  In the words of the old song, \\"Is that all there is?\\"     <BR>      Just to see if Kanon is improving, I took a look at his newer Book, \\"The Good German.\\"  He's hasn't: same weak reliance on coincidence and chance.

This is an outstanding book about men at war: the American army against an unorganized, but well armed mob of Somalis -- men, women, and children -- in Mogadishu in 1993.     <br />     What grabbed my attention was that the Americans sowed the seeds of their own destruction. The Somalis, the author details, came to hate the American rangers.  For months, the U.S. army had patrolled the city of Mogadishu, swooping down in black helicopters to terrify and intimidate the local population.  They rocketed Somali buidings, killing both clan leaders and innocent people.  The wash from the rotors of their hovering helicopters pulled tin roofs off Somali houses, ripped clothing off Somali women --even pulled babies out of of the arms of Somali mothers. When the opportunity presented itself -- a Black Hawk helicopter down and a small isolated ranger force surrounded -- the Somalis extracted a terrible revenge.    <BR>  <BR>      On one level, this is a gung-ho book of skilled, courageous American soldiers blasting their way out of an unfriendly city, losing a few men in the process but inflicting terrible casualties on their opponents.  18 U.S. soldiers were killed; at least 500 Somalis died. But the Somalis won the battle -- and the war.       <br />     On another level, this is a cautionary tale of how not to make war by alienating the people you have come to help -- and a blueprint for terrorists and sleazy warlords who want to learn how to defeat the United States.  The astonishing superiority of the American military to any other on earth can be countered by inflicting a few casualties on the Americans, whereupon they will alter their battle plan and abandon their military objectives to rescue their fallen colleagues, dead and alive.  Take a thousand casualties to inflict one, the warlords might conclude.  If you bloody their noses, the Americans will quit and go home.                        <BR>    <BR>     As it embarks on a dangerous and uncertain course of action in Afghanistan, the U.S. must heed the lessons learned in Somalia.  Black Hawk Down is a good book about waging modern war.	2001-10-23
US	52496636	R1JE1NS271QB4T	0226743403	605161724	The Jewel in the Crown (The Raj Quartet, Book 1)	Books	5	120	123	N	N	One of the best novels ever written	The Raj quartet -- which begins with the Jewel in the Crown -- is a meticulously thorough and detailed examination of the last days of the British empire in India. All four novels in the quartet circle around a single event -- the rape of an English girl by persons unknown in 1942. <br /> This is not an original novel. Scott borrows his story from Forester (&quot;A Passage to India&quot;) tosses in a little Kipling, injects a Mother Teresa clone (Was Scott influenced by Mother Teresa or was she influenced by Scott?), Gandhi, and &quot;Freedom at Midnight.&quot; He has the usual British obsession with social class. But nobody has ever examined so minutely the British Raj. In fact, the main criticism of the novel might be that Scott tells far more than you wanted to know about the British in India. <br /> Scott's characterizations are marvelous and always changing as he shifts viewpoints. Mildren Layton is despicable in the third book of the quartet, but rehabilitated slightly in the fourth. The policeman Ronald Merrick is fascinating: menacing, pathetic, courageous, cruel, and brilliant in turn. An American would portray him as a flawed hero who rose above his humble origins through hard work and diligence. To the British, he is a villain for exactly the same reasons. <br /> The Raj Quartet is not for everybody. It presumes that you have knowledge about India and the British empire. It's a little tedious in places. I thought the fourth novel in the quartet was a bust, until it redeemed itself with a dynamite conclusion about the last days of British India, the horrific communal violence between Muslim and Hindu, the fate of Ronald Merrick, and the return to the story of Hari Kumar, the tragic Indian boy who loved and lost the English girl raped in the Bibighar Gardens in 1942.<br /> I don't read nor enjoy much of what is considered &quot;good&quot; literature, but the Raj Quartet is an exception. This is an exceptional novel by any standards.	2001-10-23
US	52496636	R2560NI95VYLU6	0684813785	681707236	The Making of the Atomic Bomb	Books	4	9	11	N	N	A complicated but fascinating history	A good book, but I thought the author could have done better in singling out truly important scientific developments from those which were less significant. He needed to tip off the reader, &quot;big deal coming up,&quot; so the non-physicists like me wouldn't miss the point. I came away, for example, with the impression that Einsteins's famous letter to Roosevelt warning about a possible German A-bomb was not really all that important. Is that what the author intended? <br />Rhodes inspired me to look elsewhere for more information, so I read General Groves' book.(Groves has the head of the Manhattan Project.) Groves' book is as charmless as the man, but as a corrective to Rhodes, it was interesting. Rhodes focuses on the scientists who developed the bomb; Groves portrays the project more as an engineeering feat. Rhodes' hero is the gadly physicist Szilard; Groves' is the DuPont Corporation. My suspicion is that the most difficult part of making the bomb was putting together the huge uranium and plutonium manufacturing complexes at Oak Ridge and Hanford rather than the famous work of Oppenheimer and colleagues to make the U235 and Plutonium explode.  <br />An interesting point is that, at Groves' first meeting with the scientists, they expressed concern about their possible loss of royalties from patents. By contrast, DuPont did all its work for cost plus $1 profit. So much for scientific altruism and corporate greed! (p.s. I do not have any association whatsoever with DuPont.) <br />The author led me to an affection for the experimental physicists, especially Enrico Fermi, but I was less impressed with the contribution of the theorists. He wrote superb passages on the Dresden and Tokyo fire-bombs, the first A-bomb test, and the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. He did a good job of portraying the coarsening effect the war had on people like Oppenheimer who began to talk with enthusiasm about killing tens of thousands of people.<br />I do not disagree with the decision to drop the bomb. The bomb ended the war quickly and Hiroshima was no more a moral atrocity than the firebombing of Dresden or the rape of Nanking, but Rhodes shows us how horribly bloody minded the whole human race became in the caldron of war. May we not fall to such depths again.	2001-09-07

The others, also very good, are Bridge on the River Kwai and Empire of the Sun. <br />The theme is how men survive in the horrendous conditions of POW camps. Set in one of the worst camps, Changi, near Singapore, an American corporal, called The King, thrives. He is street-smart, unscrupulous, the most powerful man among the 10,000 prisoners, and somewhat appealing in his vulnerability. The King is also honest -- at least about himself -- and the only other honest person in the book is his antagonist, the wretched, diarrhea-ridden British cop, Grey, who is attempting to rise above his lower-class origins. Most of the other British officers in the book are revealed to be vicious hypocrites. <br />The King and his callow, worshipful friend, a British pilot named Marlowe, outsmart everyone...but then the war ends, and the real world begins again. This is a good tale on several levels: adventure, survival, an insider's look at a Japanese POW camp, and an examination of the differences between Brits and Americans. The movie rates five stars. The book is almost there.	2001-09-03

This is a good survivor story -- and I like survivor stories -- but what really made me sit up and pay attention was Heinlein's casual introduction of radical technology into the story. Rather than space ships, Heinlein's future has \\"gates.\\"  These are matter transmitters.  One steps through a \\"gate\\" and instantly finds himself transmitted to his destination. This was a mind-blowing  concept to me at the time -- and still is. What I enjoy most about Heinlein is his skillful incorporation of science and technology into adventure stories: moving roadways in \\"Let the Roads Roll;\\" a fourth dimension in \\"There was a Crooked Man;\\" weapons and jet-packs in \\"Starship Troopers;\\" and the magic carpets in \\"Glory Road.\\"  Nobody has ever wrapped a story around a technology as well as Heinlein.  He wrote some of the worst books I've ever read, and some of the best.  ... is one of the best.	2001-08-15

These former Pueblo Indian farming communities are located in the middle of nowhere and the fact they were able to exist -- and apparently thrive -- in a hostile, desert environment adds to their appeal and mystery.  Riley has turned out a competent, readable survey of the Indians of the Rio Grande in pre- and early-historical times.  In the first half of the book he gives a thorough account of all aspects of Pueblo Indian culture:  history, language, agriculture, religion, technology, trade, etc.  The second half is devoted to their contacts with Coronado and the other early Spanish explorers and settlers.   He presents in brief form a lot of information, but most of what he says is jargon-free and comprehensible to non-archaeologists and non-specialists.   I liked the book and it will stay on my shelves as a ready reference to the Pueblo Indians.	2001-07-30

The Jumanos, for the 99.9 percent of readers who have never heard of them, were a tribe of Texas Indians who lived on the Rio Grande and Pecos Rivers.  By 1700 they had pretty much disappeared.  So shadowy are they that some authors have even doubted their existence as a tribe.  I got interested in the southwestern Indians and kept running into references to the Jumanos, so I read this book -- the only one that's every been written on the Jumanos, I would guess.  If you -- like me -- enjoy truly obscure Americana -- especially southwestern Americana -- you might like reading this.  The writing is professorial, but the author constructs the history of a vanished people and their contacts with early Spanish and French explorers. She makes a persuasive case that the Jumanos were a Tanoan people, related to many of the Pueblo Indians.  Previous writers had considered the Jumanos as Uto-Aztecan, Caddoan, or Athabaskan.  If you comprehend those last two sentences, you might like this book.	2001-07-30

But one can see this series beginning to trickle away.  Former Police Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is now a talkative old duffer and maybe he should be retired (with laurels) from the series.  Sergeant Jim Chee seems to have given up his ambition to be a Navaho singer and is now fully committed to being a cop. This story was simplistic and superficial compared to others in the series and the climax was flat and unsatisfying.  Still, Hillerman at his worst has many virtues.  Bernadette Manuelito is a great new love interest for Chee -- far more engaging and sexy than the unlamented feminist, Janet Pete.  Cowboy Dashee and Captain Largo were more interesting in this book than in previous appearances.  But the well seems to have run dry for Hillerman and Hunting Badger lacks the fascinating descriptions of landscapes and mystical ceremonies of his many previous books in the Navajo detective series. Try another one, Tony!  How about sending Chee and Bernie Manuelito -- sans Leaphorn -- down to the Apache reservation in a really dark and enchanting story ?	2001-07-03

He has two upright sons and a separated wife, Gwenn, who has a terminal addiction to lovers who are losers.  His friends include a likeable, devious and over-sexed dwarf, a German soldier with one foot, and an ancient Englishman.      All these exotic characters are found in exotic locales along the Nile in 1939-1942 as Rommel advances toward Egypt and the British fight desperately to halt him.  This, of course, involves Anton, who always finds trouble, and his military-age son Wellington. Gwenn is keeping company with a detestable Frenchman; the dwarf is calculating how he can get even richer with the war         The greatest part of the book, especially toward the end,  is devoted to war in the desert.  The descriptions of the war are a little confusing. More explanation as to why, for example, the Foreign Legion is clinging so desperately to a particular patch of sand would be useful. Courage abounds in this novel; fear is not so evident -- and more would be welcome in a dramatic sense.  Likewise, the hardships of heat and thirst in the desert don't seem to be exploited as effectively as they could be.        But this is a good adventure tale, better written than most, and I look forward to the next book in the series.	2001-07-02

The two mystery writers at the top of the pack are, in my view, Tony Hillerman and P.D. James.  This book had all the virtures of James -- intelligent plot, well-drawn characters, interesting setting -- but still missed fire just a bit.  There were too many bodies for one thing.  One should be sufficient for a good mystery.  I counted five in this one and that seems a cheap way to prolong and complicate a plot.  The detective, Daghleish, seemed a little tired.  The bodies are showing up by the bucketful and he just keeps on plodding along as if he were investigating dead tomato plants instead of dead humans.  Where's his outrage? Or at least his concern about the damage being caused his reputation by an investigation that stimulates carnage rather than preventing it.

I was in the mood for a good WW II novel, but this is really a soap opera with a  World War II backdrop.  Coming Home is too long by half, filled with endless descriptions of everything: clothes, scenery, people, probably pillowcases and cooking pots.  At scene painting, Pilcher is outstanding.  She made me want to visit Cornwall.  The scenes of English country life in the 1930s were idyllic -- too idyllic -- and the heroine is too goody-goody to be believed, but the scenes of loss and longing in wartime were effective.

I read somewhere that more movies have been made about Wyatt Earp than all the U.S. presidents combined!  There's something about the gunfight at the O.K.

I read Tombstone first when I was in high school back in the 1950s and I've since dipped into it countless times.  Some might object to the author's purple prose and made-up dialogue and newer scholarly studies of the Earps and Tombstone may be more accurate and balanced.  But Burns drew his material from interviews with old-timers and Tombstone newspapers and I'm confident that he comes about as close to fact as you can get.

A lonely 17 year old girl caught up in the blitz meets a man who dies.  She searches out his family home and finds contentment and love.  The cast consists of mildly eccentric country types in a World War II setting. But the novel didn't teach or tell me anything of value. It's just a story.	2001-04-14

First, and most seriously, it's incredibly complicated and dense, a virtual catalog of the comings and goings of hundreds of characters over a six year (1832-1838) period. You need a scorecard and an atlas to keep track of the players.  Secondly, the author's judgments about Indians are politically incorrect and come close to being racist.  Example: the \\"laborious accretion which convolutes the fore-brain and increases the cultural heritage\\" makes the white man superior to the Indian.   And, third, DeVoto's wordiness (see preceding sentence) and flip judgements are ever so cute.  But I've had this book on my shelf for many years and have read it through more than once. I can overlook the irritations because DeVoto tells a magnificient story about a magnificient land. \\"Broken Hand\\" Fitzgerald, Bridger, Carson and their colleagues are great American heroes, warts and all.  Someday, I hope that a writer with the soul of a poet and the diligence of a scholar writes a better book than this about the mountain men.  Until that happens, we have Across the Wide Missouri.

Parkman is a priggish, Boston snob who complains his way across the West. He despises the pioneers crossing the plains and has no interest in them -- a startling lack of consciousness for a historian. The Indians and the mountain men fare little better.  A better, more generous book by a young man in the west is Wah-to-Yah and the Taos Trail by Lewis H. Garrard.    Smallchief	2001-04-09

Shaara's book meets this test.<br />     I want to know if Winfield Scott was as good a general as he is portrayed to be.  I want to know if Robert E. Lee was as saintly and naive as he is portrayed by Shaara. The brief appearances in the novel of Grant, Beauregard, Jackson, McClellan and other military officers who would later be famous made me want to know more about their participation in the Mexican war. <br />     I am also curious as to why the Mexicans lost this war -- although they would seem to have had the advantages in manpower and resources, fighting as they were in the heartland of their country against a U.S. army of no great size and skill.    <br />      The U.S. is often condemned for its agressive war against Mexico, but, right or wrong, Scott's campaign to capture Mexico City seems to be one of the great miliary exploits of all time.  I need to learn more to decide whether this is true or not.  Shaara has raised all these questions in my mind.	2001-01-12

But be warned that you'll be disappointed.  <br />      Mitchell tries hard and seems to know his geography and Navajo stuff, but the story and characters seem contrived and artificial.  You want his story to succeed -- but it doesn't.  He just doesn't have the finesse, the inventiveness, and the story-telling ability to carry it off.	2001-01-09

There's a heavy dose of the execrable Henry Adams and his repulsive colleagues in both books.  The tone and tenor of the two books is similar.  The difference is that Byrd has created several very interesting and sympathetic characters:  the fictional journalist Trist, the pathetic Clover Adams, and, of course, Grant himself. Grant is a saintly figure -- something of a fool to be sure, but an admirable, saintly fool. Thus, I finished Byrd's book and enjoyed it -- and I cast Vidal's aside after a hundred pages.	2001-01-09
US	52496636	R16YJXT89WLP4Q	0345390032	682977168	Sign-Talker: The Adventure of George Drouillard on the Lewis and Clark Expedition	Books	5	13	13	N	N	A new American hero	Thom has created a new American hero with this book -- the brooding, efficient half-breed George Drouillard -- and he has singed the reputation of an existing hero: the dark and depressive Meriwether Lewis.         French/Indian mixed bloods were the pathfinders who led the Anglos into the wilderness and Thom gives some long-overdue recognition to them. Drouillard's reaction to the well-known events of the Lewis and Clark expedition are what make this book fascinating.  We get a view of the white man from the standpoint of an outsider.  Unlike most books of this sort, however, Drouillard's views are multi-layered.  He admires Clark -- and occasionally even Lewis -- at the same time that he often finds their attitudes and actions reprehensible.  He sees the Indians in a sympathetic light and he foresees their rapid downfall at the hands of the rapacious Anglos, but he doesn't idealize them a la Dances with Wolves.             History confirms that Drouillard was a formidable woodsman and hunter, one of the most valuable members of the expedition.  Thom gives him also that mythic quality of Shane and every other lonely gunslinger of American literature.    Smallchief	2000-12-29
