The book was well reviewed in The New Yorker five years ago, which is why I bought it, but I had trouble getting through it, I know I completely missed its point, and I guess I won't be reading other novels by Sebald.<br /><br />This is Sebald's first novel, though two others of his were translated into English first and appeared in America to positive reception: The Emigrants and The Rings of Saturn. The book reads as \\"experimental\\" prose, interweaving the author's own memories with fictionalized accounts of the nostalgic and journey experiences of Kafka, Stendhal and Casanova in four parts.<br /><br />From what I can tell, the book is a consideration of memory, its elusiveness and its meaning, but it wasn't a consideration I found compelling. I have a respect for the author, who is German and lives in England (he is a professor of modern German literature at the University of Manchester), and the work he does, but I was not moved by it. I did find the best section, the most readable, to be the final one, in which Sebald returns to the German village that was his childhood home and makes a thoughtful comparison of the village he finds today with his memories of the community where he lived as a child. It was a longer section, and so held my interest more.<br /><br />He has a lyrical and intriguing writerly voice (he writes that Casanova \\"likened a lucid mind to a glass, which does not break of its own accord. Yet how easily it is shattered.\\"), but the entire did not make enough of a whole to engage me. Perhaps his other novels are more engaging...	2005-10-03

RAISING LESS CORN, MORE HELL: THE CASE FOR THE INDEPENDENT FARM AND AGAINST INDUSTRIAL FOOD by George Pyle is an eye-opening treatise on the damage that overproduction and overdevelopment of food does to our economy, our health and our ways of life. These wrongs are committed through the industrialization of food that has occured in the United States in the twentieth century, and Pyle makes a convincing case in easy-to-read reportage that outcomes of this process are not good.<br /><br />Pyle, who is currently an editorial writer for the Salt Lake Tribune, was raised in Kansas and spent several years as editorial page editor at a newspaper in Salina, Kan. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1998, and this book shows his valuable journalistic sensibilities in an issue of great public interest. He is able to clearly (and colloquially) make his case in all the areas he focuses on through thorough citation and primary reporting.<br /><br />The book (after an interesting prologue titled \\"Searching for Roots: Or, How I Learned to Start Worrying and Love the Small Farm\\") is divided into sections with chapters that explore the aspects of \\"Wealth,\\" \\"Health\\" and \\"Security.\\" \\"Wealth\\" deals primarily with the faulty economic assumptions that spur American growers to grow not just crops but their own operations, borrow money for bigger and better machinery, and commoditize themselves right out of a profit. He also deals with the corporate farms and giant cattle and hog farms that are springing up all over the nation. (The farmers make all the investments in facilities and the corporations take none of the risks, but control all the prices. The corporations can also decide not to use a farmer for whatever reason after he or she has made the investments in all the facilities...) This sections lays the groundwork for the fundamental pricing issue of Pyle's thesis: Overproduction drives down prices for American farmers, causes worldwide commodity \\"dumping\\" and discourages developing nations from growing their own foods. It's really a \\"death cycle\\" of farm economics, but individual farmers feel compelled (and are supported by short-sighted governmental policies) to get as much as possible out of their lands to get bigger profits (or smaller losses) each season, even while this action contributes to driving down real farm wages over time.<br /><br />The second section, \\"Health,\\" deals with the consequences of genetic modification of crops and the issues associated with feeding livestock corn and chopped up animal bits, contrary to nature. And there ARE consequences. Some of the consequences are trade related (the EU and other nations won't allow GM crops to be imported, resulting in trade embargoes, political conflict and accusations and aspersions cast on U.S. crop exports) and some are health related (cows should not be fed corn, as when they are, e. coli develop in their intestines... this would be fine if slaughterhouses were clean or careful enough to keep the organs away from the saleable meat, but they aren't... also, mad cow comes from feeding cattle, which are herbivores, bits of other animals, including brains, to fatten them up). Pyle makes such a  convinincing case against both these practices, that it has caused me to be more careful in what I purchase and what I eat.<br /><br />The third part, \\"Security\\" focuses on how easily U.S. food production could be terrorized, either by a malicious party or by nature because of its uniformity and its determined ignorance of natural threats and defense. The previous two sections figure in this argument given all that the author has laid out for readers leading up to this penultimate part.<br /><br />The afterword is particularly instructive. Pyle ties together the themes of his work and focuses the reader on going forward toward something positive. We must find local growers of food, we must allow our food to be a local product, we must be receptive to nature's lessons, and we must seek change in the economic and political climate that encourages our own farmers to drive themselves out of business and our food out of natural confines.<br /><br />The book is serious, but fun to read, as Pyle's voice is colloquial, strident, but personable. One of my favorite passages,  in which he makes an analogy that instructs us on crop rotation, and intermixed crops: \\"Imagine that you are a discerning, well-cultured, and intelligent person. Imagine that you really like chocolate. But I repeat myself\\" (p. 187). His headnotes for chapters are diverse, interesting and eclectic, as he quotes communicators from William Shakespeare to William Shatner.<br /><br />I strongly, strongly recommend this book. It's something we should all be concerned about, and Pyle's treatment of the issue is comprehensive and accessible. It changed my thinking about food, made me more informed as a consumer and a citizen, and I think it will do the same for you!, and we must seek change in the economic and political climate that encourages our own farmers to drive themselves out of business and our food out of natural confines. <br />  <br />The book is serious, but fun to read, as Pyle's voice is colloquial, strident, but personable.

While it's not at the level of her better known novels The Age of Innocence or The House of Mirth, it's quite worthwhile. Wharton wrote GLIMPSES in 1922, two years after winning the Pulitzer Prize for Innocence. (She was the first woman to win the prize.)<br /><br />The premise of the book is that two society people from New York, Susy Branch and Nick Lansing, decide to marry. They are in love, but the twist is that their marriage is ostensibly a business deal: While they are socially connected, neither one of them has enough money to live the life of their peers. Because of this, they live off their friends' generosity and whims. They scheme to marry because with all the honeymoon gifts, money, precious items, and the subsequent lending of homes their friends will make to them for their honeymoon, they will be able to live the life they want for at least a year. They also agree that if either one of them finds a way to make a better match for him- or herself, they will willingly free each other from the marriage.<br /><br />Their subsequent personal and physical journeys are the subject of the rest of the book, as they try to resolve themselves to their situations and look back on what they have together and how their future will play out.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this book was written in 1922. The prose reads like a current novel, and Edith Wharton is, as always, deft at skewering the moral bankruptcy of the very rich at the same time she demonstrates a fundamental understanding of their world. Those caught between, like Susy and Nick, make fascinating studies as their characters grow toward or away from the light this lifestyle casts. Wharton also keenly portrays the very human behaviors of individuals on whom she concentrates, and shows both Susy and Nick as sympathetic and frustrating simultaneously to the reader as they each seek to come to terms with their options and their feelings toward each other in light of their current values. No one is really the hero or the anti-hero here. It seems in some ways to be a realistic portrayal of maturity and some growth, while also being a tale of the power of affluence and ease to corrupt and weaken.<br /><br />As I wrote, this book is \\"lighter\\" than Mirth and Innocence, but it deserves to be read. Some aspects of it seem a little too tidy, but not completely unconvincing. Wharton is a master -- one of my favorite authors -- and this book demonstrates her abilities in a clean, straightforward story of two lovers and the impact of their community on their relationship, their values and their behaviors.s they each seek to come to terms with their options and their feelings toward each other in light of their current values.

I adopted a system of reading chapters of it between other books after starting out great guns the summer of 2004, reading 200 pages and realizing that if I didn't do something to break it up, I would never finish it.<br /><br />That is not to say that THE SECOND SEX is not a great book. It is. It's valuable. It's interesting. It's educational, not just about views of women in the first part of this century in Western culture, but also about the logical and writerly process that de Beauvoir uses to address such a massive topic: The topic of Woman; the topic, really of Woman as Other.<br /><br />But there are issues with the translation that can't be ignored. If memory serves me, Parshley had trouble getting de Beauvoir to help him with his translation. Questions he directed to her went unanswered for months, so he not only translated the book, but cut large sections (yes, this 732-page version is abridged!) that he thought were not important, or were redundant. Parshley also was not a philosopher, but was a zoologist, and as such did not understand the depth of such existential and philosophical terms as \\"immanence.\\" Once the translation was finished and published, de Beauvoir was furious with the results. Though Parshley can hardly be blamed given the situation in which he was working, it does make one wonder how much what one is reading resembles de Beauvoir's original ideas and objectives.<br /><br />Considering her objectives, this leads me to one of my favorite quotes about THE SECOND SEX. Nelson Algren, the Chicago writer who was the longtime lover of de Beauvoir (with whom she traveled when she wrote America Day by Day; he was also the writer of The Man with the Golden Arm), said that when the book came out, there was much brou-haha, especially when 22,000 copies were sold in France the first week after it was published. Algren noted that de Beauvoir was the most reviled and the most beloved woman in Paris, and it was clear: \\"She meant it.\\"<br /><br />The book is quite logically organized, which makes it easy to pick up and put down (and to read bits of between other works). Part I: Destiny includes chapters on biology, psychoanalysis and historical materialism. The other parts of the book are: history, myths, the formative years, sitautions, justifications and toward liberation. De Beauvoir uses examples from myth, literature and doctor's case files to illustrate her positions. And her positions are more and less relevant today than they were in the 1940s when she wrote the book. The chapter on lesbians seesm less relevant, since she bases her understandings of the homosexual orientation on situational and envrionmental factors. However, I found her chapter on motherhood to be extremely cogent, as she deals with the issues of expectations of self-realization through children, the disappointments and the isolation of mothers, and the societal expectations of mothers of both girls and boys. And de Beauvoir notices the logical conflict between a society that lauds motherhood for women, but denies them a public voice and equal public standing. This is a typical style of argument for de Beauvoir, and I find her insight, her wisdom, her logic and her organization in this book to be impressive.<br /><br />De Beauvoir writes, \\"One is not born a woman; one becomes one.\\" I think it can be argued that she is not saying that female humans are born the same as male humans, because we all know, or are ourselves, people who were born with strong tradtional male or female traits inherently. Rather, after reading this large and complete work, I think she is saying that women are not born second-class citizens, they become them, through societal shaping, political pressure and self-monitoring. They become the Other because they start to believe they are. While I think we have made strides since THE SECOND SEX was written, reading this book nearly 70 years after it was written is a little upsetting: some of the saddest aspects of the life of the Other for women still ring true.written, reading this book nearly 70 years after it was written is a little upsetting: some of the saddest aspects of the life of the Other for women still ring true.	2005-08-28

The Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz was leading an administration that was working to enact land reform. It was hoped that these efforts, among others, would stem the tide of poverty in a country still bound to a labor system that forced poor people to work a certain number of days on large farms or face prison time. Shaking off the vestiges of a dictatorship that was defeated by popular elections in the 1940s, Guatemala sought such reforms to enfranchise more citizens.<br /><br />The \\"fruit\\" of the title is that of the United Fruit Company, an American concern with large land, labor and capital holdings in Guatemala and the Caribbean. UFC also had a lot of influence in government, particularly with Eisenhower's Republican administration. When Arbenz's government took the rights to Fruit Company land (much of its land was left uncultivated, held as an \\"in case\\" the company said) and paid it the value the company had listed on its Guatemalan tax returns, influence was peddled in Washington, the word \\"communism\\" was thrown around, and Eisenhower gave the go-ahead to covert operations to overthrow the democratically elected Arbenz and replace him with an American supported military junta. Ironically, the Guatemalan move to democracy in the 1940s was inspired by FDR and the country's belief in rights for all humans, whatever the economic level. (Truman, apparently, would not approve such operations, so the Fruit Company had to wait for Eisenhower to effect the outcome it wanted.)<br /><br />The book is a model historical work, heavily footnoted, clearly written, factually presented and overwhelmingly upsetting. It has a chapter on Edward Bernays, an early practioner of PR, who was Freud's nephew, and who was hired by the United Fruit Company to advance its goals in the United States. Bernays did powerful work and was probably instrumental in the coup taking place by building public sentiment in the United States against the Arbenz government.<br /><br />The greatest and most painful irony of all was that not long after the coup, which was instigated, basically on behalf of United Fruit Company, the U.S. government, concerned that it would seem a little \\"too convenient\\" to have overthrown a popularly elected president on behalf of a banana company, decided to bring an anti-trust suit against United Fruit, hobbling the company. One has to ask at that point, \\"What the heck was it all for, then?\\"<br /><br />The final chapter answers that: An April 1998 report found that 150,000 people had been killed and 50,000 had disappeared in the time since the coup in 1954, with 80 percent of the casualties caused by government forced.<br /><br />What this book reports on made me sad and disgusted, but the book is well written and fascinating, a model historical account of a pivotal incident in the history of both Guatemala and the United States.in the United States.

US	52928260	R39P8RU5MIZBV0	081296621X	663839632	The Balkans: A Short History (Modern Library Chronicles)	Books	3	74	77	N	N	A solid work on a complex history	THE BALKANS: A SHORT HISTORY by Mark Mazower is part of a lovely series of small, attractively designed and published books by Modern Library called Chronicles. This book, while short (156 pages), is chock-a-block with information on the Balkans going back to the beginnings of the Ottoman empire in the region, and including not just the former Yugoslavia, but also Bulgaria, Romania and Greece. (It also includes a handy timeline in the beginning in 330 C.E. with the founding of Constantinople and ends in 1999 with the war in Kosovo between NATO states and Serbia.) The chapters, while assembling information on the history and region chronologically, also provide thematic studies on religious life, national identity, crime, politics and the effects of Empire in the Balkans (there's that word again!). \\"The Land and its Inhabitants\\" is the first chapter and goes back to deal with foundational issues of regional politics, religion and custom. \\"Before the Nation\\" is about the self-identities of Balkan residents before nation states separated people by ethnicity (and some of Mazower's assertions are surprising if seen through today's anti-Turk frame in the region, that Balkan Orthodox peoples felt more loyalty toward the Ottoman regime than toward Catholocism). \\"Eastern Questions\\" deals with the end of both the Ottoman empire in Europe and the end of the Habsburg dynasty, and \\"Building the Nation-State\\" sees the course of these non-nationalist people through to the Croatia-for-the-Croatians type of mentality in the region of the 1990s.<br /><br />The book's jewels, I think are the introduction, \\"Names\\" and the epilogue, \\"On Violence\\" which seek to catch the reader in Balkan assumptions, shattering them and facilitating real learning. In the latter, Mazower asserts that it isn't age-old prejudices that caused the Balkan war of the 1990s, and that Balkan people are not a thing apart from Western Europeans or Americans. Mazower cautions that dismissing Balkan violence as isolated to the Balkans is self-serving for Westerners as well as blinding.<br /><br />I think this is a good, but densely packed, work on the region's history, with new insights and supporting information. Mazower makes fine use of observations by travelers of the time in the Balkans to support the lens through which he views the region and make it lively. I recommend it.olated to the Balkans is self-serving for Westerners as well as blinding. <br />  <br />I think this is a good, but densely packed, work on the region's history, with new insights and supporting information.

Coetzee, the Nobel Prize Winner in Literature, is a novel about a city magistrate in a frontier village of a nameless empire. The narrator, whose name we do not learn, becomes involved with a \\"barbarian\\" woman after a visiting soldier captures some tribespeople and brings them back to the camp for \\"interrogation.\\" The woman is crippled (specifically, she is hobbled as well as blinded), and the magistrate begins a strange relationship with her.<br /><br />During their brief romance, so to speak, the magistrate doesn't have sex with this object of his affection, but instead, he likes to wash her body, and fall asleep next to her (he does occasionally see a prostitute in the town, though). The woman has a job during the day in the kitchen. There is genuine affection between the magistrate and the barbarian, while in the town the soldiers from the empire are interrogating (torturing) native peoples and building fear in the town against the barbarians. The magistrate, however, believes that the barbarians are no threat to the Empire, that they have their own rhythm and lifestyle on the land. As the fervor from the Capital builds against the Barbarians, the magistrate finds himself questioning and challenging his own society, particularly after a trip he takes to find the barbarians. When he returns from the dangerous journey, he faces consequences that cause the reader to question authority, its right to power and its right to brutality.<br /><br />This novel was one of my favorite Coetzee's, behind \\"Disgrace\\" and \\"Age of Iron,\\" because it has a more cohesive storyline than, say, \\"Elizabeth Costello\\" or \\"In the Heart of the Country.\\" But it was also, again, quinstessentially Coetzee, dealing with some of his consistent issues, such as linguistics and communication, power structures, colonialism, force and meaning, and the journey as process and perhaps a symbol of growth, insight or acceptance. I think we can see in Coetzee, in this earlier work, that these themes and images of the whole are present and pulsing.<br /><br />The preoccupation with meaning, communication and language is present here. The magistrate collects little wooden slips that he has found in the ruins of a people long since disappeared from the border areas of the frontier town. The marks on the slips and their opaque meaning to the magistrate and his contemporaries illustrate how ephemeral written language can be.<br /><br />But he also doesn't speak the language of his own people, in terms of understanding the values of the military types who come to represent the empire. And this is where we start to deal with the theme of power, control, the state and colonialism, and the clash of civilizations over legalisms (boundaries, prisoners, etc). The cultural clash comes to be not only between the Empire and the Barbarians, but between the frontier magistrate who sees the barbarians as people and his own aggressive, colonizing culture.<br /><br />This clash leads to a changed situation for characters in the book. And the book provokes the reader to start working through the question of what does authority really mean? Is force equal to power, really? How does one square a reality in which one is suddenly at odds with the structure and culture that kept one safe for so long? The magistrate struggles with this, as well.  It is as if learning this lessen makes him naive again, and blaming the Empire becomes a panacea for the magistrate, who is, I might add, not a very sympathetic character, but is all we have... We can see the beginning and end on the wooden slips the magistrate collects. The writers of these have gone away, past even memory, the language is meaningless, their words meaningless designs found in the sand.<br /><br />And as always, with Coetzee, we must consider, what does language even mean? What does it do? Our magistrate loops his thoughts around what words mean, what his self-talk means, what all this has to do withreality and understanding.<br /><br />This book expertly entwines these themes of colonizers and their language, what it means to them, what they believe, what they tell others, and what they cannot understand through a narrative that is engaging on a plot level as well as a thematic one.<br /><br />I loved this book. It would, I think, be an effective introduction to the works of Coetzee and also serves as a way to further inform our understanding of his preoccupations, themes and questions.this has to do with reality and understanding. <br />  <br />This book expertly entwines these themes of colonizers and their language, what it means to them, what they believe, what they tell others, and what they cannot understand through a narrative that is engaging on a plot level as well as a thematic one. <br />  <br />I loved this book.

I recommend it unequivocally to anyone who makes decisions, and particularly to those in organizations and assessment and management positions.<br /><br />D&ouml;rner, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bamberg, writes about tendencies in decision making, basing many of his conclusions on experiments and simulations he has run with human subjects. For example, he has had subjects manage a mythical area of Africa, Tanaland, to help the nomadic peoples there. The managers can control all areas of life, public works funding, pesticide control, legal issues of grazing, housing matters, etc. In another, D&ouml;rner makes his research subjects the mayor of a mythical town, Greenvale. Again, they can address many issues related to life in this community, education, employment, taxes, public services, business development, tourism, social programming, etc. He also does a brief study of Chernobyl to analyze how that disaster happened through logical failure.<br /><br />Dealing with how people make decisions, the real and root processes of decision making in humans, D&ouml;rner makes the point early on that decision making is not an isolated process. \\"But I am not concerned with thinking alone, for thinking is always rooted in the total process of psychic activity. There is no thinking without emotion\\" (p. 8). He also makes the point that thought is rooted in value systems, and that our decisions are generally made to bring us closer to the goals that are based on these values. Given this basis, D&ouml;rner shows throughout the book various tendencies individuals have when faced with ambiguity in decision-making situations and with complexity that overwhelms them. Sometimes people will focus so tightly on an area in which they are comfortable or will allow themselves to be distracted by small items to avoid coping with complexity.<br /><br />Often, we cannot know all we need to know about a topic. D&ouml;rner writes about the success rates of participants who utilize planning procedures for a limited time, then go to work, but who revisit their issues and are willing to change, vs. those who just set right in without situational analysis, get confused by unintended consequences and start blaming outside factors or creating \\"myths\\" or superstitions about why they are experiencing the problems that they are.<br /><br />Comfortingly, D&ouml;rner's research results show that some planning that is moved into action, with frequent analysis of the results of the decisions is effective. He also writes about other effective methodologies, such as thinking by analogy, to generate better understanding of a process.<br /><br />The entire book, by enlightening the reader on the factors involved in decision making -- emotion, values, fears -- helps to create greater perception on what we do in our own processes of making decisions and following up on them. The book, divided into chapters called \\"Some Examples,\\" \\"The Demands\\" (which deals with complexity, dynamics, intransparence, ignorance and mistaken hypotheses, and steps in planning and action), \\"Setting Goals,\\" \\"Information and Models,\\" \\"Time Sequences,\\" \\"Planning\\" and \\"So Now What Do We Do\\" does effectively dissect the processes and issues in complexity and understanding them (how hard it is to really understand exponential growth for example, or time's effects on variables).<br /><br />The book is conversational, with great examples, and fabulous data charts that illustrate the concepts about which he is writing. And it stays in the top of one's mind. I'm going to keep this handy at every work place I ever inhabit as it is a fabulous reference book.

Thursday Next works for the British government's special operations checking out literary hoaxes. And in her adventures in the first installment, The Eyre Affair, she learns that people can move into books, and book characters can come out into the world. The second book, Lost in a Good Book, has her apprenticed to Miss Havisham (from Great Expectations) as a Jurisficition agent, policing books, book characters and general book order and safety from the Great Library. The Well of Lost Plots continues this line of focus with Thursday taking refuge from the world in a book from the Well, the place where books are placed if they are unpublished.<br /><br />Thursday is living in a book, Caversham Heights, on a character-exhange basis. She is filling in for a book character named Mary, who wants a year off acting our her part in the book. Thursday, who is expecting her first baby with her eradicated husband, needs a place to flee the world while continuing her apprenticeship with Miss Havisham and awaiting her trial for a \\"fiction infraction\\" from the first novel, The Eyre Affair in which she changed the ending of Jane Eyre. Thursday learns different Jurisfiction skills, prepares for her certification exam, learns to use footnoterphones to communicate, councils generic characters on how to become more multidimensional, tries to fend off the memory-attacking skills of Aornis Hades, the sister of Eyre Affair's villian, Acheron Hades, endures her trial, and waits with the rest of the book world for the introduction of UltraWord(TM), the new book system that the Council of Genres is developing. There's a lot going on here.<br /><br />And yet the book is very difficult to get into, since it's really just one darn thing after another for more than half of it. While some of the threads come together at the end in a page-turning climax, a lot of it just seems to be Fforde being clever (just because you can think of something clever, doesn't mean it should get its own chapter). The way he depicts the book world is interesting and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, but the purely episodic plot for most of this book makes it the weakest of the three we've read so far.<br /><br />I hope Something Rotten has a little more plot, and I also hope some of the continuing unresolved items get tied up in the next one. I guess I called this a series of mysteries, but really, these three books could all be one large novel. But if it were, we'd still be waiting for the end...ally just one darn thing after another for more than half of it.

I picked it up once before and couldn't get into it. This time I was more prepared and stuck with it. It was written and published as a serial in 1913-14, and I bought it because it was about characters in Prague by a Prague writer. (Ironically, Meyrink and Kafka both knew Max Brod.)<br /><br />The story of the Golem of Prague is what drew me to the title, which I bought in an English-language bookstore while I lived in Prague. The legend is that Rabbi Loew, in the Jewish quarter in the sixteenth century, created a man out of mud from the Vltava River (the Moldau) and gave him life by putting Hebrew characters on a paper in the man's mouth, or by writing EMETH (truth) on the golem's brow, and taking that life away by erasing the first later, leaving METH (death). He used him to labor in the synagogue, and in some stories the golem protects the Jews from murderous pogroms. Sometimes the golem breaks free or is forgotten and violence is rained down on his community. In Prague, I used to hear the legend that the body of the golem was still kept in the attic of the Old-New Synagogue in the Jewish quarter.<br /><br />But this book isn't that much about the golem, and is more about a single man, Anthanasius Pernath, a gentile who lives in the Jewish Quarter in Prague at the end of the 19th century. He is an engraver of precious stones, and has many odd and paranormal experiences in the quarter, as he narrates about the people he knows there. One of the events is that the golem brings him a mysterious book. In another incident, he follows a winding staircase through the Quarter and finds himself in a room with the golem's clothing. There is intrigue, crime, mystery and, many, many odd, seemingly unexplainable incidents that occur.<br /><br />Meyrink was really into the occult, including astral projection (when the soul, leaves the body and can sense and remember all that it sees in its distant journeys). These influences come into the book more than the golem and its legend do, I think. The book was made into two German expressionist films, and reading the book, one can see the logic of this kind of treatment of the story from another medium.<br /><br />I'm not sure, however, that I liked it. As I mentioned it had a lot of paranormal occurences, and the golem was really the least of them. I felt there were probably many references that I wasn't getting, and I also felt the work was pretentious. There were segments that were definitely reminiscent of Kafka, even though it is published before (I guess it's just that I read The Trial before I read this), including a long section in which a character is held in jail by secret police. I liked the segments on Prague and the Quarter very much for nostaligia's sake, and I found the ending poetic and interesting.<br /><br />But unless you are into Meyrink particularly or the occult generally and experimental fiction overall, I would suggest you skip this one. (For a more thoughtful and touching treatment of the legend of the golem, I recommend Chaim Potok's IN THE BEGINNING.)nfluences come into the book more than the golem and its legend do, I think.

This was fascinating to me, as my reading in the area had included these countries when their history intersected Bosnia's, for example. The book is a travelogue, a history and an anthropological study, and includes wonderful references for other works on the region, including not only West's (Kaplan writes that he would have rather lost his passport and all his money than his thumbed and annotated copy of Black Lamb), but also a book I hadn't heard of to which Kaplan often refers: John Reed's The War in Eastern Europe (1916). (This is the Reed of Reds fame.)<br /><br />Kaplan interviews people, like Croatian journalist Slavenka Drakulic, writes about his travel processes, tells the history of the places he stays, and draws sharp distinctions among the areas of the same nation (in Romania, for example). He also clearly outlines the territorial disputes that have roiled the region for centuries. He doesn't feel compelled to cover everything, but hits on items that are representative, illustrative, or just interesting. For example, he writes of two Croatian bishops and their differences, Josip Strossmayer, a pan-Slavist, and Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac, a Croatian Catholic who was a little too tight with the Nazis and the Fascist government of Croatia during WWII, even after he was aware of, and was horrified by, their crimes.<br /><br />Each chapter of the book -- Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece -- is fascinating, well written and draws a picture of the region and its history that is alive, painful at times, and provocative as well. Kaplan writes of the painted monasteries in Romania beautifully, as well as the depicting the horrific genocidal crimes committed against the Jews in that same country when many were forced onto the slaughterhouse conveyor belt and murdered in a violent pogrom. He writes of the differing natures of the nations, their histories and their struggles at the beginninng of the 90s, when this book was first published. The content is what I love most: It's as if he found a way to use all his notes and create a vigorous and complete picture of the land and its people (as opposed to the necessary but truncated news stories that get published about a single aspect of a political or historical situation). He writes of the decrepit hotels, the depressing travel conditions, the locals' responses to the end of communism and racial/ethnic oppression by their governments. He proposes that Orthodoxy is a key part of not only the identity of the people in the Balkans, but also their shroud and veil, for good or ill, to the influences of the West.<br /><br />I have only two petty complaints about the book. One is that he doesn't use the diacritical marks over the Slavic alphabet, so one cannot tell if he is spelling the names and places as we in the West should/would say them or as they are really spelled. A second small thing is that the edition I have has columns he wrote in the beginning about the West's roll in the Balkans when Bosnia and then Kosovo erupted. I found these added little and were a distraction from the deep heart of the book. This is about the people, the land, the times and the foundations of these times in the past. The columns are an American journalist's brief response and prescriptions, and don't fit with the main text.<br /><br />In the preface to this book, Kaplan quotes American scholar Paul Fussell, \\"the secret of the travel book [is] to make essayistic points seem to emerge empirically from material data intimately experienced\\" (p. xxxvii). This is something that Kaplan clearly is ableto do throughout BALKAN GHOSTS. It is a fabulous book, for those who like to travel and read, or for those who just like to read. I recommend it.early is able to do throughout BALKAN GHOSTS. It is a fabulous book, for those who like to travel and read, or for those who just like to read. I recommend it. <br />	2005-07-06
US	52928260	R11KNFPNZXY60B	0805210407	377046405	The Trial	Books	4	6	7	N	N	The Life of the Mind	This is the story of Joseph K, a bank clerk, who one morning, with no warning and without having done anything wrong that he knows of, is arrested by two warders in his rooming house. The book follows a year in his life as he tries to cope with a case in which he is not aloud to know the charges against him, manages the impressions that the charges against him make on others in his life, comes to believe that no one is ever found innocent, and tries to navigate an unnavigable system. While the book is unfinished (there is a clear gap in the narrative between the two final chapters), the ending is definite and dramatic. I won't give it away here (though I'm sure many of you have read it), and I don't think I need to; it's not the most important thing to discuss.<br /><br />The nature of the narrative is of a dream state; in fact, so many of the sentences are written in the subjunctive case. \\"Might have been,\\" \\"perhaps he was,\\" \\"must have been\\" and \\"possibly\\" and other ways of expressing supposition are constant motifs. Another dreamscape occurence used frequently by Kafka here is that he will, for example, be in a room a long time, and then will suddenly notice another person in the corner that he hadn't seen before. Event grows out of event, and the reader with some distance can declare that it seems too fantastic, but once one is pulled into the narrative, the world begins to create its own kind of sense, and the bizarre situations seem more organic and believable.<br /><br />We never know what K's crime is, but given the subconscious \\"reality\\" of the narrative, one may suspect that it is a personal or character crime, which only he alone can render a verdict on. Perhaps it is his sexual activities or want of those activities with the women who move throughout the narrative. Perhaps he feels guilty of these feelings or urges. Perhaps it is his hubris (he dismisses his lawyer in the case thinking he can do a better job) and he doesn't really seem that likeable of a character, though one can't help but sympathize with his plight. Perhaps it is his inability to accept the ambiguity of the case itself...?<br /><br />The second to last chapter in the cathedral (St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle?) seems to me to be the key to the book, as a priest in the cathedral tells Joseph a Talmudic like parable, then illustrates the commentary on the parable, which is about a man who approaches the law and his response to what he is told about it. While all the book was moody and fascinating, this chapter is the shining heart of the novel for me. I loved it. It illustrates, perhaps (!), not just K's approach to the power of the law, but also humanity's systemized approach to any truth revealed.<br /><br />I really liked this book, and I recommend it.of a character, though one can't help but sympathize with his plight.

US	52928260	R1IDM2IKTQNSZ	1932958509	464768713	Fools Rush In: A True Story of War and Redemption	Books	3	14	18	N	N	Intimate and Horrifying	FOOLS RUSH IN by Bill Carter is a memoir of the siege of Sarajevo by an American who voluntarily went there to help the Bosnians victimized by the Serbian aggressors.<br /><br />Carter had recently lost a girlfriend suddenly in a car accident, and he was looking for something to do to get away from his grief. He went to the Balkans, where he had a friend working for an aid organization in Split, Croatia. He couldn't get an \\"official\\" job in Bosnia, during the war, so he joined The Serious Road Trip, a group of internationals, who drove brightly painted trucks and cars and delivered food aid to beseiged people while juggling and clowning for the kids. Carter's main friend in the narrative is Graeme, who utters some funny Brit black humor in the course of the surreal events of the memoir. (\\"Easy there, Spam,\\" will forever be part of my ideolect.)<br /><br />Carter essentially moves to Sarajevo, and stays in an office tower near the front lines, the Unis Towers. He tells of the daily hardships of living with no sure supply of water, food, gas, electric along with having to move through the city ever-aware of snipers. The Serious Road Trip delivered food to different groups around the city, mostly based on interpersonal relationships the members of TSRT developed. For example, Carter meets two sisters who lead him on a run across Sniper Alley (they accused him of being a \\"war tourist\\") to their apartment, which they couldn't leave once the siege began until their father dug a tunnel out of the building, as the main exit faced the Serb-occupied hills. In the family's apartment, Carter feels guilt over enjoying the hospitality they offer him. He can see from their faces and bodyies that they are slowly starving, but they are all amazed when they find a bullet in the flour he was carrying in the box of groceries he was taking to them as he ran across Sniper Alley. He watches a video with the family of a birthday party, and in the video, as they celebrate, a bullet comes through the window and lodges in the wall.  After the instant of the shot, the family recovers and continues the celebration. After showing the video, the mother tells Carter, \\"Our first bullet.\\"<br /><br />It is unreal and inhumane moments like this that are best illustrated in Carter's narrative. Much of the last half of the book deals with Carter's idea to get U2 to publicize the problems in Sarajevo because of the siege. (The UN brought in food for those trapped in the city, but the Serbs wouldn't allow it to be delivered unless they got 40 percent of it themselves. The UN troops also kept Sarajevans in the city, not allowing them to connect with the free Bosnian territory just beyond the UN controlled airport.) The U2 aspect was interesting, and illustrated how the world came to be outraged about what was happening to Bosnians, but it was less interesting than the small moments so well depicted by Carter's intimacy with the lives of Sarajevans but colored by his \\"foreigner's\\" view, as an American. His stranger's view of the situation allows him to voice his moral outrage, but his intimate experience with the city's horrors, and his own hardships because of it, allow him that outrage, legitimize it.<br /><br />The thing I didn't like about the book is an aspect of Carter's personality that I term (borrowing from organizational communication) \\"low elimination breakpoint.\\" Carter seems to be better than everything, or at least everything around him has intolerable flaws. Aid organizations are too bureaucratic, so he won't work with them. Even though he works in film and makes a documentary of the hardships in Sarajevo during the siege, working in film is also not good enough for him. Etc. I found some of the writing overwrought (he was the most in love of any person ever in love, for example). He seems to morally eschew attention for his work in Bosnia, but then is offended when he doesn't get what he thinks is his fair share.<br /><br />One of the most moving and upsetting moments in the narrative is when TSRT is trying to get out of Bosnia to collect supplies and stays with a Muslim family in a town after the Croats have turned on their Muslim allies against the Serbs. Carter and his colleagues know the town they're in is about to be ethnically cleansed, and the family they're staying with will be victims of that cleansing. There is a teen-age boy in the family who tells them it isn't their war, and Carter thinks, whose war is it?\\" A boy's war? People who didn't cause it, but are about to be killed en masse because of their Turkish sounding names? TSRT can leave the town, but the people with whom they've stayed cannot. Again, it's the intimacy and humanity of the encounter that make the impression. Carter later hears that the people of the town who could flee tied handicapped and sick people to their beds and fled the genocidal murderers by running into the woods. That's all he knows of the family who sheltered him...<br /><br />I bought this book at an English-language bookstore in Sarajevo, so it was richer to read about such places as Sniper Alley, the Holiday Inn, the Old Town, the tunnel the Bosnian forces used to get supplies and soldiers into and out of Sarajevo after having seen them myself. It's a good book and serves as an effective companion to the historical and political reportage that exists on the war.

FEARLESS INTERVIEWING: HOW TO WIN THE JOB BY COMMUNICATING WITH CONFIDENCE by Marky Stein was recommended to me by a friend who felt she had gained some useful knowledge from the book. I was intrigued by the title, and as I sometimes work with students applying for jobs, I thought it could be an interesting read.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical, though. These things often seem to promising but are really about situations that don't translate into daily life, or into one's own life, very well. However, I was won over by Stein's book. She gives the reader real things to do in an interview (particularly during that crucial \\"first impression\\" phase) that are really helpful. For example, she writes that interviewers are often nervous about the task of hiring someone; therefore, their primary goal is to discern whether the interviewee is friend or foe. There are some particular ways she advocates of making sure the interviewee demonstrates that he or she is a friend: Arrive early; don't touch or put things on the desk of the person interviewing you (that is a personal space, and putting your things, or even your hands there, can be read as threatening); make sure you smile, it shows that you are friendly; don't take a seat until you are invited to do so, and if you are not, ask if you may sit; sit forward on your chair to show energy and enthusiasm, etc. She gives tips on dress, what to bring, etc. She also gives very helpful tips on how to answer common interview questions and what their purpose is (content questions vs. stress questions), how to follow up, including an example of a thank you letter, which she calls a \\"focus letter,\\" and how to negotiate a good salary.<br /><br />The best part of the book, though, is how she coaches the reader to find his or her own \\"Q statements\\" to use in an interview to demonstrate his or her effective work history. Q statements are quantitative statements of qualities the applicant has. For example, instead of saying, \\"I'm a good salesman.\\" Say, \\"I increased my department's sales by 30 percent the first year I was on board,\\" etc. The last section of the book is basically a work sheet in which Stein poses likely questions interviewers will ask applicants, with blanks to write in your own answers, preferably in the form of those Q statements. I found it really enjoyable after reading the book, and it made me really enthusiastic about my career. Because you draft your own statements, it isn't cheesy or fake or scripted. She just shows you how to be at your best in a stressful situation.<br /><br />As I said, I like how she gives the reader pointers on things to do so that one can feel confident that one is meeting important standards in the interview and application process. I will definitely recommend this book to my students; and I heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new job!a good salesman.\\" Say, \\"I increased my department's sales by 30 percent the first year I was on board,\\" etc. The last section of the book is basically a work sheet in which Stein poses likely questions interviewers will ask applicants, with blanks to write in your own answers, preferably in the form of those Q statements.

In this book, Drakulic writes chapters on various accused war criminals from the war in the former Yugoslavia. To write the book, she traveled to the Hague and observed the trials. She is a native Croatian, and now lives most of the time in Sweden.<br /><br />Drakulic's writing is clear and strong. At times she imagines the homelife of the various accused invidividuals or what their thoughts or surroundings might have been as they proceeded through the war, doing what would eventually land them in The Hague, but her imaginations aren't unethical or posed in a way that is difficult to separate from the facts at hand. Drakulic is really an \\"everyman\\" trying to understand crimes which seem incomprehensible to others. She struggles throughout the book to do so by examining individual cases in depth.<br /><br />The various chapters deal with different crimes and individuals in the various regions of the war in Yugoslavia. For example, in chapter 3, \\"A Suicide Scenario,\\" her first chapter about an individual, she writes about a Croatian man who testified for the authorities against other people in his village, and who was eventually killed by a bomb in his backyard after the war was over. She writes about the \\"You took a television\\" defense among townspeople in small villages after the war (and the war crimes) ended. Perhaps someone saw someone execute a Muslim or a Serb citizen in the street, but if he were to mention it, the perpetrator of that crime would remind him that he stole things from the home of that murdered man, and he would fall silent, ashamed of his own act, not recognizing the differences in the crimes, not willing even to take responsibility for a stolen TV. As the chapter on the murdered Milan Levar (the man murdered for cooperating with investigating authorities) shows, many Croatians despised the tribunals, wanting to try people themselves. But what they wanted more was to ignore the crimes, according to Drakulic.<br /><br />Another chapter that was fascinating was \\"He Would Never Hurt a Fly\\" about Goran Jelisic, a Bosnian Serb. Jelisic liked to fish, and before the war, he was involved in minor criminal activity, but was a very relaxed, friendly man. She writes that he looked like someone you could trust, and since he is the age of Drakulic's daughter, she imagines him as a friend of her family's, coming over, sitting around, talking. The Tribunal sentenced him to 40 years for executing 13 civilians; however, it is believed that he actually killed more than 100, most of whom were Bosnian Muslims. In his trial testimony, people spoke of how he helped them during the war. In fact, even Muslims from his town testified about how he helped to save them. Yet in the camps, in which Muslims were rounded up and imprisoned, he randomly chose men to shoot in the head, and he made them place their heads over a grate because he hated the mess. He seemed to revel in his power and kept a running tally (out loud) of how many people he had killed.<br /><br />Other interesting chapters deal with a man who was a Serbian soldier and was brought one day to a field near Srebrencia. Then the busses started coming and unloading men. All day he shot men, Muslims from Srebrenica (where ultimately around 7,500 civilian Muslim men were killed). And in the beginning of the day when he protested, the other men in his group threatened to kill him. In fact, there was one he knew didn't like him and wanted him gone (because he had mixed parentage). Or the chapters deal with more famous men on trial: Ratko Mladic, a general in the Bosnian Serb army, and the suicide of his medical student daughter after she took a trip abroad (did she find out about what her father was doing while in Russia?) and Slobodan Milosevic and his wife, Mira Markovic, their strange bond, and their ruinous (former) control over Yugoslavia and Serbia.<br /><br />The final chapter, \\"Why We Need Monsters\\" and the epilogue are powerful statements on the vignettes Drakuliæ has told in her book about the trials, the individuals on trial, and therefore the very personal side of war. Drakulic wants to know how ordinary people can turn into horrifying demons in a time of war. Why are some people so willing to kill? What would another do in the same place? Given that personality is emergent, it's a frightening yet fascinating question.<br /><br />\\"The more I occupied myself with the individual cases of war criminals, the less I believed them to be monsters. What if they are ordinary people, just like you and me, who found themselves in particular circumstances and made the wrong moral decisions? What might this tell us about ourselves?\\" (pp. 167-168).<br /><br />It is this understanding of what might lie within the \\"normal\\" man or woman that we don't want to know. As she says, we would rather study an exotic insect in the Amazon than understand what we have at home.<br /><br />The heartbreaking epilogue is about the prisoners in Scheveningen detention unit in The Hague, where the accused are housed as they await trial or their verdicts.

Given that personality is emergent, it's a frightening yet fascinating question.  <br /> <br />\\"The more I occupied myself with the individual cases of war criminals, the less I believed them to be monsters. What if they are ordinary people, just like you and me, who found themselves in particular circumstances and made the wrong moral decisions? What might this tell us about ourselves?\\" (pp. 167-168). <br /> <br />It is this understanding of what might lie within the \\"normal\\" man or woman that we don't want to know.

Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner is a great read. It's interesting, well written, cogent and engaging.<br /><br />The idea behind the book is that idealogy is how we want the world to be, but economics reveals how the world IS. The economist in question, Steven D. Levitt, has won the John Bates Clark Medal, which is awarded every two years to an economist under 40. Levitt, at the University of Chicago, likes to analyze data to debunk conventional wisdom, and Dubner, who had written about Levitt for the New York Times Magazine, writes about his results in a personal and colloquial voice. For example, when he writes about how Levitt has found that a child is 100 times more likely to die in a swimming pool accident at her friend's pool than in gunplay at a friend's house where there is a gun, he introduces the topic by stating that Levitt's own son died at a young age of a sudden illness.<br /><br />The chapters are equally fascinating and deal with the following topics: what schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common (incentives and cheating); how the Ku Klux Klan and real estate agents are similar; why drug dealers still live with their mothers; why the crime rate went down in the 90s; what makes parents \\"perfect\\"; and the economics of naming children. I learned a lot that changed my view of the world, which I think is what good research can do -- it challenges your assumptions with facts to back it up.<br /><br />For example, did you know that there is no correlation between stay-at-home moms and high early childhood test scores? However, there is a correlation between parents with a lot of books in their homes and high test scores (but not one between parents reading to their children every day and high test scores). The main crux of this chapter was that it isn't what parents DO, but who they ARE that most influences their children. Another fascinating revelation from the research is that most drug dealers cannot afford to live on their own, because drug dealing, like most industries, has only a few spectacularly successful individuals (the Donald Trumps of drugs). Most drug dealers make so little money, but live in hope of making their big break, so they continue the very dangerous work in hope of that ultimate reward. Another really interesting chapter is the final one on baby names, including a discussion on \\"high end\\" names vs. \\"low end\\" names, how trendy names make their way<br /><br />through the population and what names can mean to a child's way of life (for example the siblings \\"Winner\\" and \\"Loser\\"). The authors' predictions of the next \\"Madison\\" is great food for thought!<br /><br />The most challenging chapter assumptionwise deals with the crime rate, and how (and why) it fell in the 1990s. The authors assert that it wasn't greater community policing, stricter sentencing, etc., that made the difference, but a Supreme Court decision made years before that cut crime. They offer convincing arguments to shore up the conclusion that legalized abortion in the 1970s cut crime in the 1990s. (For example states in which abortion was legal before the rest of the nation saw crime rates drop before the rest of the nation). They assert that this information suggests that women who elect to terminate pregnancies are good judges of how well they are suited to raising children. (The individual factos of single-parent homes and having a teenage mother apparently EACH double a child's propensity to commit a crime, and having a mother with low education, one study found,<br /><br />is the \\"single most powerful factor leading to criminality\\" (p. 139).)<br /><br />This book, which deals with all these subjects, from the gravitas of abortion and crime to the smaller or \\"lighter\\" matters of naming trends is always readable and always feels relevant. I loved how it used exisiting research to unearth truths about incentives, values and trends. It's easyreading and so eye-opening. I unreservedly recommend it.y reading and so eye-opening.

I was looking for something clever and \\"frothy.\\" Thinking of the fine fun tradition of Bridget Jones, The Devil Wears Prada and The Nanny Diaries, I went for it. But it was disappointing, and I wouldn't rate it nearly as high as any of those. Here's a bit more about the book.<br /><br />The novel is told from the point of view of the (nameless) friend of Julie Bergdorf, department store heiress and the quintessential Bergdorf Blonde. It begins, \\"Bergdorf Blondes are a thing, you know, a New York craze. Absolutely everyone wants to be one, but it's actually tr&egrave;s difficult.\\" (p. 1). The narrator has an American mother who has married into a middle class life in England but has aspirations of aristrocracy for her daughter. The daughter lives in New York, works for a Vogue type magazine (like Sykes, the book's author, who went to Oxford and is a contributing editor at Vogue), and scampers and cavorts, gets mental health advice from a dermatologist and tries to find the right man. Since her best friend is Julie Bergdorf, whose life is consumed with getting into the best sample sales, jetting about the world, dating the wrong, but suave, men and Chloe jeans, these concerns loom large in the plot of the novel.<br /><br />While the book has humorous moments, the main characters are not likeable at all, really. They are so vacuous and the whole goal is finding the right man. I don't think the book really succeeds a la Bridget Jones because one wonders why the nice, worthwhile guys the reader is supposed to be rooting for would even like these women, whereas with Bridget, we knew her to be imperfect and insecure, but funny, sweet and loyal.<br /><br />I say \\"skip this one.\\"	2005-06-09

Friedman is a continuation in many ways of the main ideas Friedman wrote about in his well known and popular book THE LEXUS AND THE OLIVE TREE. FLAT even has a continuation, or extension, of his Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention (The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention). But this book can stand on its own as Friedman asserts that we've moved from Globalization 1.0 (Countries globalizing with the Industrial Revolution) to Globalization 2.0, which was the subject of LEXUS, to Globalization 3.0, individuals globalizing. The further enmeshment of global resources and influences in world trade is the subject of FLAT.<br /><br />Friedman got the idea for the title of his book after speaking to a businessman in Bangalore, India, a city that has profited mightily from the outsourcing that companies the world over have been able to do since the dot-com boom and bust, in which thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable were laid then sold for pennies on the dollar when companies went belly up. The businessman said that the playing field was leveling due to the reduction of trade barriers held up by nations to protect their own workers. For example, did you know that last year alone, 400,000 U.S. tax returns were prepared by accountants in India? Now ambitious Indian educated citizens don't have to leave India to work hard in information and professional jobs. They can stay home and get good work opportunities. This level playing field is the flattening of the world as Friedman sees it.<br /><br />But Friedman isn't a free-trade-and-let-the-others-be damned kind of guy. He acknowledges the damages that globalization can do, and advocates necessary friction or barriers at some points along the way to flatness. However, he does say that American professionals (young and old, entry-level and experienced) should become \\"versatilists\\" because just when you think your job can't be outsourced to India or China, it will be. He goes into some detail about how to make yourself special, specialized or adaptable to protect yourself or to keep ahead of the negative effects of flattening.<br /><br />Friedman also worries about the state of education in our country today. He is worried that while our higher education system is one of the best in the world, our K-12 schools are not keeping up with the demands of a flat world. {He backs this up with an assertion by Bill Gates that America's high schools are \\"obsolete.\\") He asserts that countries like China and India are not racing America to the bottom of the wage pool (fighting for low-paying manufacturing jobs), but they are racing us to the top. To protect our position we must continue to evolve and grow, and we must start, particularly, with comprehensive science and math education opportunities for girls and boys, as young as possible.<br /><br />The book progressed in a very readable form, with the first section \\"How the World Became Flat,\\" which included four chapters, \\"While I Was Sleeping,\\" \\"The Ten Forces That Flattened the World,\\" \\"The Triple Convergence\\" and \\"The Great Sorting Out,\\" in which he outlines the factors that have or are flattening the world, and how their coming together has brought us to where we are today. The second section, \\"America and the Flat World\\" has four chapters on our place in the changing world of technology, trade, culture and growth. Four shorter sections finish the book, \\"Developing Countries and the Flat World,\\" \\"Companies and the Flat World,\\" \\"Geopolitics and the Flat World\\" and \\"Conclusion: Imagination.\\" As each chapter ended I would think, \\"What else can he say about this? It seems like he's covered it all...\\" And then I would continue reading and be fascinated by the new application, and the different ramifications of Globalization 3.0.<br /><br />I think the book was at its best when he applied his knowledge, understanding and unique framing of globalization to a subject aboutwhich he is also greately knowledgeable, Islam and its relationship to terrorism (if you haven't read his FROM BEIRUT TO JERUSALEM, you should!). Friedman writes cogently of how Al-Qaeda reacts to globalization in an effort to stanch its influence and reach within Islamic societies yet simultaneously uses globalization's societal changes to its advantage for communications, research, fund-raising and money transfer.<br /><br />[He also writes very interestingly of how India, the world's second largest Muslim nation with 150 million Muslims and the world's largest democracy had no 9/11 terrorists and no known Al-Qaeda members. He makes another connection between oil-rich oppressive regimes and terrorism.]<br /><br />One of the most moving subjects of the book comes toward the end, when Friedman writes of an Indian businessman who returned from working abroad to start a school for children of India's lowest caste, the untouchables. The story underscores his position on education, development and hope undermining terrorism's pull in the developing world. The boarding school takes children from squalid conditions and educates them for a professional life. Friedman engages in a typing race with one of the young girls. He has a touching story about asking the children what they want to be and hearing things from doctor to astronaut to poetess. He writes that their dreams keep them from destructive desires:<br /><br />\\"All dreamers in action--not martyrs in waiting\\" (p. 468).<br /><br />Friedman writes very conversationally and clearly, using effective and engaging metaphors for what seems like a complex and complicated subject. I loved this  book, I loved the process of reading it and all that I learned doing so, and I recommend it without hesitation.ject about which he is also greately knowledgeable, Islam and its relationship to terrorism (if you haven't read his FROM BEIRUT TO JERUSALEM, you should!).

The second Thursday Next novel, LOST IN A GOOD BOOK by Jasper Fforde, takes right up for the first, THE EYRE AFFAIR, left off.<br /><br />We are back in the Great Britain of Fforde's 1986, in which the Crimean War is just wrapping up, literature is the great driver of pop culture, and the government division of Special operations employs Thursday as a literary detective. This time, she is the repeated target of coincidences that all seem aimed to kill her. The complicated plot involves her renegade chronoguard father, her eradicated family member, her pregnancy, her own trial for changing the plot of JANE EYRE in the first novel, her intense efforts to avoid cooperating with SpecOps' PR woman, the case of the CARDENIO manuscript, her efforts to find out who is engineering coincidences to try to kill her, her<br /><br />training by Miss Havisham from GREAT EXPECTATIONS as a Jurisfiction agent (who can jump into and between books) and the pending end of the world.<br /><br />The book is very much like the first, with punny names (like agents Kannon and Fodder, who are very quickly dispatched), interweaving, action-oriented plot lines, and fun and interesting literary allusions and plot devices. It's very difficult to summarize because there are so many different threads and characters, but we really enjoyed this one, so plan to read the next one, THE WELL OF LOST PLOTS, within the next<br /><br />couple of months. The writing is very readable and fun. I recommend this!	2005-05-07

I wish I hadn't lived so much of my life without it in my mind, informing how I look at others and what I think my place in the world is, because I think this book does change how one sees good and its role in the lives of those hurt by the cruelty of humanity.<br /><br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the story of young Scout, who starts the book out remembering her life at the age of 6. Her brother, Jem, is 10, and their summer neighbor, Dill, is 7 (\\"I'm little but I'm old,\\" he says.) (Interestingly, the character of Dill is based on Truman Capote, whom Harper Lee knew as a child.) Their father, Atticus Finch is an attorney, and their mother, who died when Scout was 2, figures not at all in the story. The family has a black maid, Calpurnia. Various neighbors are also mentioned: Miss Rachel, Dill's aunt; Miss Maudie; Miss Stephanie; Mrs. Dubose; and, of course, the Radley family, in the spooky house the children had to pass on their way to school. The novel begins with Dill's first summer in Maycomb, the small Alabama town that is the setting for this novel. Dill, Jem and Scout fixate on getting \\"Boo\\" Radley to come out of his house. Boo is a mysterious man, about whom the neighbors trade stories and with whom the children like to scare themselves. Atticus takes a dim view of the children using Boo and his life for various entertainments and chides them whenever he finds them engaged in one of their attempts to catch a glimpse of him.<br /><br />The summer ends and Dill goes back to his family and the Finch children go to school, Scout for the first time. Her teacher discovers that Scout can read and tells her that her father's been teaching her all wrong and that she is not allowed to read at home any more with Atticus. Scout also gets in trouble the first day of school for standing up and explaining to the teacher why Walter Cunningham cannot accept a quarter from the teacher to go have lunch in town (he didn't bring lunch with him). Scout explains that Walter can't borrow a quarter because \\"he's a Cunningham.\\" When that is insufficient information for the teacher, Scout says, \\"The Cunninghams never took anything they can't pay back--no church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have. They don't have much, but they get along on it. ... You're shamin' him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasn't got a quarter at home to bring you, and you can't use any stovewood\\" (which is how they paid Atticus Finch for some legal work he had done for them). Miss Caroline smacks Scout's hand with a ruler; Scout tries to fight Walter in the schoolyard, and then Jem invites him home for lunch. Later Atticus promises Scout that even though she must attend school, he will still read with her every night. And so we get the tone of the father-daughter relationship, practical, loving, guidance and, more than anything, acceptance of Scout for who she is. Atticus also shows over the course of the novel the need to live up to the love his children have for him in his professional and personal life.<br /><br />Soon Atticus is engaged in a legal case that engenders criticism in the town. He has been appointed to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who was accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus's \\"mistake\\" is that he actually means to defend the man. Scout and Jem hear criticism from their friends, but Atticus instructs them never to fight over it with other children, to hold their heads up high. He tells Scout that he could never tell her to do anything again if he walked away from this responsibility. The children watch the trial and the outcome, and the reader sees that like Boo Radley, Tom Robinson is one of the people hurt by the cold world and the evil that exists in humanity. Atticus strives to help his children understand and not be brought low by such cruelty like the hermit Boo and the convicted Tom.<br /><br />Even with the verdict going his way, the father of the alleged rape victim, Mr. Ewell, vows to get revenge on Atticus for making him and his daughter look foolish on the witness stand.<br /><br />I won't go into the climax of the book, but wanted to note that what I love about it is the love that is shown by Atticus in his behavior toward his children, his client and the people he lives with in the town. Even when Ewell spits in his face, he maintains his dignity and seems to believe that Ewell needed to make the threat to carry on his life in Maycomb. Atticus is a kind of Christ figure of the Maycomb community. The children's neighbor Miss Maudie says nearly as much to their aunt, \\"Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right. It's that simple.\\" -- this even while others are vilifying him for the work he did for Tom Robinson.<br /><br />As Scout grows, her capacity to to understand grows, too, and her fascination with Boo Radley changes into a kind of longing to meet this man, who never goes outside and has no friends. She wants to meet him and say \\"hey\\" to him and ask him how his day is. Her capability to love and be kind is growing, and she wants to share it.<br /><br />The ending of the book is the apotheosis of Scout's growing capability to live, understand and treat others with dignity, and we also see the ongoing example of Atticus to do right, along with other townspeople who want to protect the weakest and smallest among them. It is truly one of the most moving chapters I've read in my life. (I tear up just thinking about it!)<br /><br />The novel itself is charmingly written, the voice is of an older Scout who maintains her independence and zeal for life, but who understands more than the 6-year-old Scout did at the beginning of the narrative.

It has history, anthropology, conservation and the mother-ship of organizational communication issues: What societies do/decide that makes the difference for<br /><br />them in their ultimate success or failure. Also, as I was reading, I would think, \\"I LOVE this book. I learn five things on every page!\\" (I learned what a palynologist was, how Australia's old soils make farming difficult, and how the Greenland Norse died out in large part because they wouldn't eat fish.)<br /><br />Diamond writes in the opening that the book's structure may be pictured as a boa constrictor that has swallowed two large animals and several small ones. The two large sections of the book deal with Modern Montana and the Greenland Norse (four chapters: \\"The Viking Prelude and Fugues,\\" \\"Norse Greenland's Flowering,\\" \\"Norse Greenland's End\\" and \\"Opposite Paths to Success\\"). The shorter sections deal with the past societies of Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, the Anasazi and their neighbors and the Mayans and the modern societies of Rwanda, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, China and Australia. The final section of the book is titled \\"Practical Lessons,\\" and in it, Diamond analyzes why societies make the decisions they do, how big business and the environment interact and what it all means to us today.<br /><br />Though not rigid in his structure, Diamond analyzes each scenario by examining five categories of influences on the outcome of that society. Those categories are environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, and friendly trade partners and the society's response to its environmental problems.<br /><br />Some have found fault with Diamond's means of analyzing these issues and his conclusions are very powerful, but flawed because he looks at island nations predominantly (whose environmental<br /><br />issues may be different, more rigid, etc.) and that these \\"under current conditions\\" hypotheses rarely hold up because people correct themselves to avert the dire outcomes that may come if those trends continue unabated.<br /><br />But having read COLLAPSE, I disagree with that criticism of the book. First, I think that while not all of the lessons Diamond extrapolates  from the examples he outlines here are applicable to each society and community on earth, general ideas are instructive in terms of how we make our choices and what we may be fooling ourselves about regarding our futures and our own culture's security. Also, Diamond's contribution to the \\"marketplace of ideas\\" along with the concerns of others and the innovations that answer those concerns are actually what avert the direst of outcomes from happening in the end.<br /><br />GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL, Diamond's preceding book in this vein, is essentially the first section of Diamond's method of \\"explaining<br /><br />it all.\\" Diamond won the Pulitzer for that book. He is a professor of geography at the University of California. He actually began is scientific career in physiology and has \\"expanded into evolutionary biology and biogeography.\\"<br /><br />I found particularly interesting the modern society chapters on Rwanda and the Dominican Republic and Haiti, but I learned an incredible amount of history, politics and anthropology along with environmental and ecological information on every page, in every section.

The book begins on a ship bound for Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The main characters are all men, British, Monegasque and American, and their names are Jones, Brown and Smith, respectively. They are in this way nondescript, nearly interchangeable (not for long), and we never learn their first names. When they dock, Brown, the main character from whose viewpoint the first-person novel is told, heads for the hotel he owns, which has slid from its heyday when there were actual tourists in Haiti; Jones ends up in trouble with the authorities (Papa Doc and his secret police, the Tontons Macoute) and Smith and his wife come to stay at Brown's hotel. The Smiths are in Haiti to promote a vegetarian center -- Smith had run for president of the United States on the vegetarian ticket, and is known to all the characters as the \\"presidential candidate.\\"<br /><br />Before Brown heads home, he stops off at the rendezvous that he and his girlfriend, the wife of a South American ambassador, used to keep by the statue of Columbus. He finds her there, and she returns with him on a visit to his hotel. In the deserted building, Brown finds the body of a former government minister in the drained pool -- a suicide. The Smiths arrive just as Brown is trying to decide how to get rid of the body... in these crisis times in Haiti, it's best not to have anything to do with any risky government official, and he managees to hide it from them. It is ironic, as that is the minister to whom they have a letter of introduction to begin pitching their vegetarian center.<br /><br />The book's plot continues on, involving the intrigues of the oppressive regime, the foreigners and their respective schemes, and their interrelationships during these days in Haiti, and their later attempts, failures and successes in leaving Haiti for the Dominican Republic. Jones is in and out of trouble. Brown tries to stay out of the way of the Tontons Macoute and in the way of his girlfriend, whose dedication to her child drives him to distraction, and Smith tries to maintain his optimism about the government of Haiti to salvage his dreams of his center (even in the face of atrocities). The plot in Greene's unique telling evokes the responses one has to any existentialist novel. There seems to be so little hope for happiness. There seems to be nothing certain except random and unfathomable cruelty.<br /><br />The \\"comedians\\" term of the title refers to the division of characters into those who are committed to something and those who are not. Brown, a lapsed Catholic raised by Jesuits in Monaco, Jones and others are comedians. By the very site of his birth in a country from which no one is really from, his uncertain parentage (he doesn't know if there ever really was a man named Brown, per se, who slept with his mother), his former career as a semi-con-man, Brown is the very definition of a comedian. The one thing to which he is now committed, his hotel, is on the verge of being taken away from him by the government of Papa Doc. He resents the commitments of his girlfriend to her son and the Smiths to their ideologies and their vegetarian center. Later in the book, when his girlfriend becomes friends with Jones, Brown's statements echo the main character's in The End of the Affair. His jealousy threatens the one loving relationship he seems to have.<br /><br />But there is another meaningful relationship for Brown, a near commitment, and it emerges with typical \\"Greenian\\" beauty and power. The book does show so well the absurdity of our political constructions and the use and misuse of power at the same time it demonstrates the sweet absurdity of belief. Greene seems to be saying that there is something very necessary and human in that kind of commitment, something to soften the edges of the hard world that cares nothing for us that we share .<br /><br/>This is a masterful novel. I recommend it without reservation!e . <br />  <br />This is a masterful novel. I recommend it without reservation!	2005-04-23

This is a well done novel based on the premise that Charles Lindberg became president instead of Roosevelt in the 1940s, and is told through the eyes of a young, Jewish boy in Newark. The author writes, using his own name, as if this were a real memoir of an era of American history that never happened.<br /><br />Roth presents this family drama expertly, drawing complete and true characters, and demonstrating their reactions to the topsy-turvy world of 1940s America. The conceit is a smart one, and the novel delivers on its promises. The reader cares for the family, and feels their persecution.<br /><br />It poses an interesting question of what if. I strongly recommend this for its beautiful fictional voice, its startlingly scary premise, and its expertly drawn drama of the political and personal.	2005-01-30

They have a confident humor and an enjoyment of the tricks of the written word and its accompanying devices, but they are wildly different in setting and theme. I like them both.<br /><br />The Egyptologist is a clever, epistolary novel that follows the dig that Harvard Egyptologist Ralph Trilipush may (or may not) be staging in Egypt in 1922, around the same time that Howard Carter discovers King Tut's tomb. (Carter is a character in the novel.) It seems that Trilipush may (or may not) be linked to a missing persons case that Australian Detective Harold Ferrell is pursuing, also in 1922, but Ferrell's letters about his case, which are intermingled with Trilipush's journals and letters from his department store-heir fianc&eacute;e Margaret Finneran in Boston to create the storyline, are written 30 years later in the 1950s to the fianc&eacute;e's nephew. (I liked the way the book was designed, with different fonts for the different letter writers and notes and diagrams from Trilipush's journals, etc.)<br /><br />Ferrell writes to Macy about the case: \\"it started as an odd-duck inheritance task, then it was a missing-person case with a dozen different clients, then a double murder, a prenuptial background investigation, then a debt-collection case, and suddenly quite a different double murder\\" (p. 10). Yes it is.<br /><br />And no it isn't, because many readers (based on my experience and reader reviews here) will figure out a key aspect of the mystery very early on. The fun of the book is figuring out the how and the why as viewed through the keenly unreliable voices of Trilipush and Ferrell (a short section of letters from two others in the end sort out some of the questions). The real attraction of the book is that Phillips plays so enjoyably with the narrators and shows very humorously and well their own agendas and unreliability.<br /><br />Egyptologist Trilipush is obsessed with his own immortality as the discoverer of the tomb of Atum-Hadu (who may or may not have been a king of Egypt, and whose name means \\"Atum is Aroused\\"! tee hee). He uses his journal to write his book about finding him before he finds him, and even writes the date of when he will find him and what it will be like before he does so. His personal obsession, overweening ego and pretentious frittering away of time and money in support of that ego are very funny. At the same time, Harold Ferrell, writing from a nursing home in Australia 30 years later is also preoccupied with his name living on in history, and turns his letters to Mr. Macy, the Margaret Finneran's nephew, into notes for a mystery novel, and he turns Macy into a character, so that one has to sort out what happened in actuality and what Ferrell is projecting on to the character of Macy who was never there at all.<br /><br />One funny and pointed example that Phillips uses, I think, to establish the unreliability of narrators due to personal translation is the examples he gives of various scholars' translations of Atum-Hadu's personal poetry, found in three papyrus fragments in the late nineteenth and early 20th centuries. Trilipush's translations are exceedingly blue (so much so that when he meets Howard Carter and states his name, Carter responds, \\"The pornographer?\\" J)<br /><br />There are many funny instances like this, and all the characters' obsessions with their legacies, their reputations and their work is presented humorously, but along the theme that the Egyptian kings' tombs imply: How is immortality achieved?<br /><br />There is a section that I thought was weak, and that is the one in which Trilipush is transcribing hieroglyphs and art that he finds on a tomb wall. The conceit was interesting, telling what may (or may not have been) Trilipush's own story through his transcription, but I found this method went on too long. I was looking ahead to seewhen it would stop. This was the one place my interest flagged.<br /><br />Interestingly, only the reader of the book and Mr. Macy will ever have all the information to understand the more complete picture of events in 1922, and those leading up to them during World War I, and that seems to me to be the real suspense of the book. I really enjoyed it, and will happily read Phillips' next novel.e when it would stop.

Coetzee, In the Heart of the Country, which was published in 1977 and is his second novel (Dusklands was the first).<br /><br />The 138-page book is presented as numbered entries (in a journal?) written by the main character, whose name we learn only once more than half the book has gone by. It is Magda. She is the intelligent, bitter, unattractive, spinster daughter of a sheep farmer in an isolated, nearly barren region of South Africa. A lead man on the farm, a black man named Hendrik, has gone home and brought back a wife, Anna, whom Magda's father takes as his mistress. Magda seems to snap and fantasizes violent reprisals against one or both of them, until the reader begins to wonder if some or any of it is real.<br /><br />We only have Magda's apparently corrupted point of view to go by. There is no other point of reference in the work. Coeztee, who was educated as a computer scientist and a linguist, presents and represents incidents in the journal in different ways, disorienting the reader, but perhaps orienting one more to the world of perception that Magda inhabits. Coetzee will take a common point in time, and have Magda represent it a couple of different ways, with different outcomes, one of which may become part of her mythology/reality. For example, she seems to say she's an only child, but she might have had a brother and other siblings. By the end of the book, the other siblings are reality for her.<br /><br />And by the end of the book, Magda has completely cracked up, if you ask me. One line I read about this book is that it is a feminine narrative a la Beckett. Coetzee, who seems to be influenced by Kafka, does present an existential image of life as a colonial presence in South Africa. The perception of Magda is her reality (as it is for all of us), she exists in a constant state of suffering and seems to have very little power over her world. The world in which she lives is cold to her, and she seems to snap a little when she sees that she cannot make the South African landscape and its culture/people yield to her will. Her (apparent) act of killing her father, hiding his body, and then, ultimately, staying on at the farm alone seems to be her wild and desperate attempt to enforce her meager power on the world. At one point, living in the house with the black servants (who previously had lived in their own small house on the grounds), Magda writes, \\"I cannot say whether Hendrik and Anna are guests or invaders or prisoners\\" (p. 112). One could say the same for her and her existence in Africa at all.<br /><br />The last section of the book is the most difficult to get through, as Magda imagines that the planes that fly overhead are dropping language down to her, words in Spanish, her interpretations of those words and her responses. She says that the \\"words are Spanish, but they are tied to universal meanings\\" (p. 126). Again, we only have her retellings of these incidents to go by, and it's difficult to decipher what \\"really happened.\\"<br /><br />And that takes us to the issue that the book seems to be working on, how much really happens, and how much does language play a part in shaping our perceptions of what happened, what we tell ourselves about the world around us, and our role in it. How does language shape our reality? She writes, \\"I have also tried to ignore the nightly messages. One cannot pursue a hopeless infatuation. ... It is a world of words that creates a world of things. Pah!\\" (p. 134). (The italicized phrase represents what Magda thinks the people on the planes are saying to her.)<br /><br />One single entry from this part of the novel reads simply, \\"How can I be deluded when I think so clearly?\\" (p. 126). I imagine any of us could ask ourselves that. Coetzee's linkage of linguistics, colonialism, literary devices and representation is a powerful, sometimes overwhelming and frustrating reading experience, but I recommend it. I certainly would love to know what others think of this odd, somewhat unsatisfying, but deeply provocative book!erience, but I recommend it.

US	52928260	R2PWNHPG454P46	0446671606	53426482	Good Benito	Books	2	6	7	N	N	This falls short	This book is a novel about Bennett Lang, a scholar of theoretical physics, and is told in short vignettes about his life, in terms of his relationships. These are in the form of relationships with teachers, lovers, friends and colleagues.<br /><br />While the book purports to be a novel, as opposed to how skillfully and beautifully Einstein's Dreams was told in short, distinct and separated vignettes, it doesn't have the main aspect that we expect in a novel, which is that we expect to be able to connect the dots in the story to form a line of plot. While I think this book has something to offer in terms of some of its ideas on academia, ambition and relationships, they are not presented cohesively enough to make themselves known in a real and felt way for the reader.<br /><br />Around 10 pages from the end of this book, I asked my husband, \\"Will we find out what this is ABOUT soon?\\" I think it would be more effective if it were more definitely divided a la \\"Einstein's Dreams\\" or more overtly connected, in the form of a more traditional novel. I would recommend skipping this one, and picking up \\"Einstein's Dreams\\" if you haven't already. That is a beautiful book!	2004-12-20

(It is close to 600 pages and I read it in five days.) The book is about the Lambert family, which includes the aging parents, Alfred, who seems to be dying of Parkinson's and other attendant ailments, including dementia; and Enid, his wife with a bad hip and a lack of patience for Alfred's failing health. They live in a fictional Midwestern city, St. Jude. It's also about their three grown children, Gary, a bank VP, who is married to Caroline, and has three boys, Aaron, Caleb and Jonah; Chip, a professor of \\"textual artifacts\\" fired for writing a paper for a student and then stalking her, who spends time on a Lithuanian Web-based financing scheme; and the youngest, Denise, a chef, who may or may not be a lesbian.<br /><br />The book is loooooooooong, although it was a pleasure to read, and I think my only substantive criticisms (which I'll just get out of the way), are that it may at times be uncontrolled and it has a lot of sex in it, overtly and covertly. After awhile I realized, that except for Enid, the matriarch, all the characters wanted to have sex with women. Gary did. Chip did. Denise did. I'm not sure that there's anything wrong with that, but it makes me wonder if Franzen just can't write heterosexual women very well. I don't know; I've never read anything else by him.<br /><br />This book is simultaneously dead-on on the realistic detail as well as fantastic, and there are some funny moments, including an early moment in which Chip is correcting student papers and writes in the margin: \\"Cressida's character may inform Toyota's choice of product name; that Toyota's Cressida informs the Shakespearean text requires more argument than you present here.\\"<br /><br />That said, there were things about this book that just made me draw in my breath because they were so pitch-perfect about the chaos and complexity of family life. Enid, as the mother, is an interesting case, because she seems never to think that she deserves to have anything she wants, but, oh!, she wants things desperately, so she manipulates people to ask for the things she really desires and initiates. She hounds Denise to help her father with his exercises, then tells Alfred, \\"Denise wants to help you with your exercises.\\" She also seeks to avoid responsibility for her comments. Note this passage from page 515:<br /><br />\\"I don't mean to criticize,\\" Enid said, \\"but [smoking]'s a terrible habit for your health. It's bad for your skin, and frankly, it's not a pleasant smell for others.\\"<br /><br />Denise, with a sigh, washed her hands and began to brown the flour for the sauerkraut gravy. \\"If you're going to come and live with me,\\" she said, \\"we need to get some things clear.\\"<br /><br />\\"I said I wasn't criticizing.\\"<br /><br />Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Moments like that show Franzen a keen observer of the interpersonal familial dialogue! He certainly gets right the way the kids grow up in the same family, have completely different experiences and different responses to the way they were raised and their aging parents.<br /><br />And their responses lead me to my final idea, the meaning of the title. There are many corrections in the novel. Chip, while a professor, lives across a bog from a correctional institution and Gary, the stockbroker, who has an interesting interior monologue on how he is not depressed because serotonin gains outnumber declines in his brain, draws connections with market corrections, the Big One of which comes toward the end of the novel. Other corrections are more oblique (but I tried to pay attention to the use of the word in the text... I was an English major, afterall). There is the correction adult children try to make for the shortcomings they perceive they had to endure in their upbringing. There is the correction that adults try to make in their growing children to keep them from not only \\"bad\\" people, but too unusual (there's the requisite, \\"You're going to sit there until you eat it\\" scene). There is the correction that consumerism can make to a lonely or unhappy soul. There is the correction drugs (legal and otherwise) can make to an ailing psyche. There is the correction family members seek for their aging father's terminal illness. There is the way the father views his hospitalization as time spent in a correctional institute. And there is the final correction of a bad marriage that is a little shocking and simultaneously depressing and uplifting.<br /><br />Franzen, through the Lambert family, takes on contemporary society and its attendant problems of expectation, entitlement, technology and distance. It's a great read, funny and fun. I recommend it.oing to sit there until you eat it\\" scene). There is the correction that consumerism can make to a lonely or unhappy soul.

Signe's mother put Signe and her three older brothers to bed, hugging Signe a little longer than usual, went downstairs to her kitchen, set up the ironing board in front of the oven with the gas on, lay down on it, and died. When a spark from the refrigerator caused a boom in the kitchen, the kids all ran down and found their mother dead. Their father was working in New York, and living in the New Jersey house he was trying to get their mother to move to when it happened.<br /><br />This event is told very objectively in the first chapter, but the book is compelling because it is a family's \\"deep map\\" tracing the psychic lines that lead to Signe's family situation, not just as the daughter of a suicidal woman, but as the daughter she is of the parents she had.<br /><br />Signe's mother was quick to unpredictable rages, and her father seemed to equate love with money, both characteristics Hammer attributes to family situations and assumptions, going back to her paternal and maternal grandparents and beyond. She traces the disappointment of her mother's marriage to her father with pretty deft descriptions, writing how when her practical and ambitious father was courting her artistic and sensitive mother, he gave her beautiful art books and talked them over with her, causing her to think that she would be marrying a man with a good career and safe income, who would still be sensitive to her talents and needs. But when Hammer's father reveals himself over time as a selfish husband and father, moving the family repeatedly after jobs that forward his own career with the railroad, trying at the last to move them out of a house in Pennsylvania that Hammer's mother had made an emotional investment in (as opposed to many of the other places she'd lived).<br /><br />The mistake Hammer's mother made about her father's lack of generosity are described by Hammer: \\"She made a mistake common to women: She believed that the lazy self-pleasuring of the table and, later, of the bed, were forms of generosity.\\"<br /><br />And so the unhappy marriage bumped along. Signe recounts the kind of constant dread she lived in when she was old enough to be conscious of the role she played in her family, the only girl, the only scapegoat for her mother's desires to be perfect and to perfect her daughter in her stead. Her brothers were in school, but Signe, home with her mother during the day, was cautious and sensitive to her mother's sudden rages and criticism. She sought to keep from bothering her mother, or needing her too much: \\"If I intruded, I might bring down her wrath. It was strict discipline for a toddler; I kept my eye on her, and she kept her back to me.\\"<br /><br />When her mother killed herself (\\"She left without leaving,\\" Hammer writes), the family was uprooted again and again for a couple of years, until her father remarried and settled down with Signe and her new stepmother back in the house where her mother had died. (She also notes that her mother's last violence had effectively ruined her father's railroad and military career, keeping him from being promoted to general in the reserves and making vice president in his company.) She continues to tell the story of the all their relationships, and follows a short thread through her own adult years, her career, her desire not to marry, not to have children. This is the least interesting part of the book.<br /><br />What I found to be the fundamental strength of this book, beyond the anger, beyond the violent central event of the narrative, was the idea that any family could write a book like this (though hopefully it wouldn't be as depressing!), because as one can trace a talent, a characteristic, a personality trait, or an eye color through geneaology, one can also trace these psychological undercurrents (or overt behaviors) to their eruption, for good or bad.<br /><br />\\"How can we know, in the wheel of the self,\\" Hammer writes, \\"what we have chosen and what is forced upon us? And why, when so much else is possible, are we doomed to live with choices made in terror and desperation, at an age so young the selves we make can never fit the fabric of a later, larger life?\\"<br /><br />This paragraph needs to be only slightly rewritten to be considered by anyone in a family, as he or she considers the imprints of generations of choices and decisions have made on our own lives. Hammer's central event is dramatic and violent and obvious, but anyone's family characteristics and \\"symptoms\\" are much more emergent and \\"iterative\\" as my friend would say, and would fit this method of investigation. I think this book is a fascinating gateway to a deep consideration of such issues for each of us personally. I highly recommend it.<br />  <br />\\"How can we know, in the wheel of the self,\\" Hammer writes, \\"what we have chosen and what is forced upon us?

Across the globe, an audience of more than 2.5 billion watched the solemn progress of Diana's cortege through the silent streets of London and the funeral service at Westminster Abbey.\\"<br /><br />This aspect gives the book a little gravitas -- the sheer impact of her fame and her death's interplay with her influence worldwide. This book was a fast read (2 days). The real value of the book comes, I think, from Andersen's reportage of the details in the opening of the book of what happened in the hospital in Paris right after she died: how Prince Charles reacted to viewing her body, how no one could find any clothes to put on her (since her pants and top had been cut off her in the ambulance and Mohammad Al Fayed had had all of her things immediately removed from Dodi's Paris apartment) so in the coffin on the way back to England she wore a dress from the British Ambassador's wife's closet, how the hospital had taken privacy precautions against the press, etc. The second part of the book that is interesting here distinctly is the last section, which dissects the events leading up to the crash (the driver Henri Paul's drinking problem and psychological state), the explication of exactly how the crash happened, who came on the scene first, how Diana was treated at the scene, her injuries, what she may have said (according to Andersen, her last intelligible words were, \\"Oh, God, what's happened?\\"), and how a variety of interplaying factors led to the deaths of Paul, Fayed and Diana. For example, if she had been wearing her seatbelt, which she almost always did, she probably would have walked away from the accident, and how, ironically, of all the people who got in the car that night, she was probably best qualified to drive it. This section and the first seem to contain the real reportage of the book.<br /><br />The middle section about her life appears to have a lot of recycled material in it, that if you've followed Diana stories and books, you've probably read this before (and to be fair, this may be just because I've read this six years after its publication). Morton's earlier Diana: Her True Story is quoted along with other somewhat accepted sources on the subject of her life. There are some tidbits, such as the assertion that Diana was set to star in a second Bodyguard movie with Kevin Costner, and that whilst Dodi was preparing to propose to her, no one who knew her well believed she would have accepted. While Andersen seems pretty objective in not portraying the princess as a saint, noting that she cut people out of her life when they said something to her she didn't want to hear, he does leave out of his book some well-traveled stories that paint her in a bad light (such as the comment she made to princes William and Harry's nanny post divorce that hinted that the nanny had had an abortion), or he glosses the negative trends in her life, living too much by (bad) instinct, her immaturity, etc.<br /><br />I thought that this book was going to be more serious reportage on the accident. While it did contain that element, it was really a book about her life, with all the usual suspects included. Really, the stuff that's new here is about the day Diana died.

From the early days when Lee Atwater looked ahead and saw that Bill Clinton was a political threat to George H.W. Bush, the book follows the thread of the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" credited by Hillary Clinton with the constant mudslinging and desparagement of the Clinton administration.<br /><br />While \\"vast\\" might have been exaggerated, this book certainly follows a loosely tied network of individuals and groups who sought to bring down the president, first to end his candidacy for president, then to end his re-election effort, and finally to replace a twice elected president with an impeachment process. (In fact, when potential donors responded to a fund-raising call from \\"Citizens for Honest Government\\" for impeachment support dollars with the question, \\"What about Al Gore,\\" the script called for the telemarketers to espond, \\"Right now, we are in the process of impeaching Bill Clinton. We are planning the same process for Al Gore\\" (p. 309).<br /><br />The activists in the process include people from Little Rock and Conway, Ark., to a billionaire (Richard Mellon Sciafe) in Pittsburgh and a literary agent in New York (Lucianne Goldberg). While they often had somewhat different reasons for hating Bill Clinton, their paths crossed in the efforts to maim his residency and finally to get him convicted in his impeachment. This book also traces the convoluted process of the Office of the Independent Council -- first Fiske, who found nothing impeachable in the president's past, and then Starr, whose ever<br /><br />wider-ranging and most desperate investigation seemed to find no problem with the collateral damage it caused in the \\"walkin' around folks\\" if he could just get a charge to stick.<br /><br />This book is intricately reported, and because of the detailed and careful research it is definitely recommended for both people interested in the political process and the media. The writers take special exception to the New York Times and the Washington Post's determined inability to report the whole story of first the \\"bimbo eruptions\\" the Whitewater brouhaha and then the Lewinsky scandal. The authors do not condone the president's behavior with Lewinsky, but as members of the media they are particularly distressed by the continuous complicity of the media with the right-wing of American political life, when facts to the contrary that at least deserved equal time were right there.<br /><br />I heard Gene Lyons talk at an event in Conway, and he said that it is as if the right tells the press not to look in a certain direction, and it doesn't. Incident after incident in this book is provided as an example of that.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this book is that while Bill and Hillary Clinton originally agreed to give interviews for the project, they decided later not to. And I think this book is better for it, because even while they are the focus of activity for all these people, they are not the main characters in the story.

The writers take special exception to the New York Times and the Washington Post's determined inability to report the whole story of first the \\"bimbo eruptions\\" the Whitewater brouhaha and then the Lewinsky scandal. The authors do not condone the president's behavior with Lewinsky, but as members of the media they are particularly distressed by the continuous complicity of the media with the right-wing of American political life, when facts to the contrary that at least deserved equal time were right there. <br /> <br />I heard Gene Lyons talk at an event in Conway, and he said that it is as if the right tells the press not to look in a certain direction, and it doesn't. Incident after incident in this book is provided as an example of that.  <br /> <br />One of the most interesting aspects of this book is that while Bill and Hillary Clinton originally agreed to give interviews for the project, they decided later not to. And I think this book is better for it, because even while they are the focus of activity for all these people, they are not the main characters in the story. The main players emerge and fade, emerge and fade as those involved in the goal of bringing down the president. The main character is the goal to destroy the Clintons. <br /> <br />This is an incredibly engaging and informative book, to which I was addicted for about two weeks, and even though I'm outraged by what I learned here, I categorically recommend this as the authority on this topic.	2004-12-06

This is obviously not a new phenomenon, because poor Tess Durbeyfield pays quite a poverty penalty through the course of Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy.<br /><br />This is the first novel of Hardy's I have read, but I chose it after reading \\"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew\\" by Daniel Pool, a fabulous book about 18th century daily life.<br /><br />Hardy's title, as quickly becomes evident, is tongue-in-cheek (he is author of my favorite title of a book, Jude the Obscure, which I haven't yet read) is ironic and mocking. Tess, the lovely and somewhat educated daughter of a cottager in Hardy's British district of Wessex, has the last name of Durbeyfield, but in the first pages of the book, her father, the ne'er-do-well, learns that he is descended from Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles, and there aren't many of them left, except his clan, as the local reverend informs him. He instantly thinks himself very grand and takes it as an excuse to go carousing, which causes Tess and one of her many younger siblings to have to make an early morning journey with the horse for the family's means of making money. Sleeping on the journey, Tess wakes to find the horse impaled in a wreck and killed. Feeling guilty, she agrees to be sent as a poor relation to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles to seek assistance of some kind. (They are \\"new money\\" and have bought the name \\"D'Urberville\\" to build position for themselves, so they are actually no relation.)<br /><br />There she encounters Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her vigorously, though she repeatedly eschews his attentions. She takes a job for his mother, watching her fowl, but one evening, separated from her friends in the village on the way home from a Saturday night out in the village, Alec stops accepting no for an answer.<br /><br />Later she falls in mutual love with a gentleman (the son of a minister) who has rejected the pulpit himself in favor of learning the trade of dairy farming so that he may run his own farm some day. Angel Clare does fall in love with Tess, but at the same time, he doesn't seem to really know her, or want to... he thinks of her as a pure country maid, and has no idea about her past. When she tries to tell him, he shushes her, thinking he knows all about her. When she finally confides in him after the marriage, the results are disastrous and Tess is once again dealing with harsh reality.<br /><br />I won't recount the rest of the story, but it's clear that the bourgeois (Alec) and the gentry (Angel) have a great deal to do with the pain and hardship of Tess's life; they inflict the poverty penalty on her. The idea of the fluidity of the aristocracy in the 18th century -- Tess is descended from them, but has no rights thereof, Alec has taken the name due to his money, and Angel has rejected the career of his familial role in favor of farming whilst entertaining a very aristocratic (and inaccurate) view of the \\"peasantry\\" -- is prominent in the novel, with Tess's inability to care for herself and fulfill her perceived familial goals without resorting to asking for help from those who don't have her bloodline at all. The town of Kingsbere, where Tess's ancestors are said to be buried, figures somewhat in the novel, and one cannot help but think that this symbolizes their use to her as being just as dead as they are.<br /><br />There are some motifs of paganism in the book... Tess meets Angel for the first time at a May dance, a pagan rite, and she has another climactic plot moment at Stonehenge toward the end of the book. Angel himself seems to reject his father's Christian teachings, and the beliefs of Tess and her society are often deemed superstitious or quaint and encompassing of pagan belief systems. Tess often wishes to be free of herlife of burdens, and who can blame her? She didn't cause the horse's death that plunged her into this chain of events, and yet she is punished and punished and punished.<br /><br />Hardy's writing is beautiful and engaging. The book, though long, seems to quickly move from event to event, and the author's descriptions are enlightening and complete. I really liked this book and look forward to reading more by Hardy.life of burdens, and who can blame her?

US	52928260	R2NP1U5BVYTS9R	0156260301	839348446	005: The Diary of Anais Nin, Vol. 5: 1947-1955	Books	4	10	10	N	N	The Rich and Continuing Saga	I just finished a book I didn't want to read, The Journals of Anaïs Nin: Volume Five (1947-1955). I had planned to read it, and its time came, but I just didn't feel like it. Happily, it took me about two pages to change my mind and enjoy this book in a little less than a week.<br /><br />Anaïs Nin was born Angela Anais Juana Antolina Rosa Edelmira Nin y Culmell in France in 1903 to composer Joaquin Nin, who was of Cuban and Spanish background, and his wife, Rosa, who was Cuban, French and Danish. After Joaquin abandoned the family, the family moved to the United States in 1914. With the disapproval of her mother, Nin began work as an artist's model to help pay the family bills, and then returned to Europe in 1923. She studied psychoanalysis under Otto Rank, practiced as a lay analyst and underwent therapy with Carl Jung for a time. Nin is also well known her for lovers, Henry Miller, Otto Rank, Gore Vidal and Edmund Wilson. She was married, I believe, twice, once to Hugh Guiler, who looked the other way regarding her affairs, and once, bigamously, to Rupert Cole.<br /><br />Nin's fame these days is primarily as a diarist, and there seem to be two veins of her diaries, those she published in an expurgated form in ten volumes, which remain popular, and another five-volume series of unexpurgated journals that focus on a shorter window of time around the decade of the 1930s. This book is from the former series, and is copyrighted in 1974. I have no idea where I got it.<br /><br />Nin also wrote fiction, and I've read two of her fictional works, Spy in the House of Love and Delta of Venus. I also have read a biography, Anaïs: The Erotic Life of Anaïs Nin by Noel Riley Fitch. She was a peripheral literary figure during most of her lifetime and she died in 1977.<br /><br />The main focus of her work seems to be psychological realism, and as she grew older, she seemed to see her diaries as the primary outlet of that stream of thought. As she writes in a letter to Max Geismar, copied into her journal in the winter of 1954-1955, \\"I only need to continue my personal life, so beautiful and in full bloom, and to do my major work, which is the diary. I merely forgot for a few years what I had set out to do.\\"<br /><br />This diary focuses on various themes of her life during this time, her struggle to get Spy published (she ends up self-publishing it), her travels and time spent living in Mexico, her friendships with Geismars and Jim Herlihy, her psychoanalysis with a Dr. Inge Bogner, and a return to the focus of her work as a diarist. She includes wonderful interludes about her life in Acapulco; a return trip to Paris, which is deliciously recounted with her nostalgic expectations sometimes being born out and sometimes failing; letters to and from Henry Miller; the fruit of her work with Bogner; and the story of her last days with her mother before Rosa's death from a heart attack.<br /><br />This last is touchingly told, and she follows her feelings about both her parents to see how she reclaimed their characteristics with pride once they were lost to her, the same characteristics she sought to reject in herself while her parents were living.<br /><br />Nin's writing is rich, like a filling meal, so the episodic and brief passages of the expurgated journals are suitable, somewhat \\"bite-sized,\\" so to speak. In many ways she is very likable, and her descriptions of her life, travels, lectures and parties (she attends a costume party for which attendees were to dress as their own madness. She went bare-breasted with a bird-cage on her head...!) are fascinating, a look at her social circle and those who influenced her.<br /><br />And sometimes, I thought, \\"Wow! I really would not like her!\\" especially when she wrote about meeting a very bizarre woman in New York, Nina Gitana de la Primavera, whom Nin admired for living even less in reality than Nin herself did. From Nin's diary description, I thought, \\"This woman is just crazy!\\" but Nin and Herlihy had a brief friendship with her, even though they had at first a deep visceral negative reaction to her. Herlihy attributed this reaction to his fear that Primavera was living as he would have liked, but was too afraid to do, so they forced themselves to spend time with her.<br /><br />The book ends with Nin recounting an LSD trip she experienced at the behest of a psychologist who was trying to study its effects. He wanted her to participate because as a writer, she could better articulate the experience, which is clearly drawn in the journal. She seems to come to the conclusion that the drugs merely heightened what was in her own mind, as symbols appeared real to her that she had previously used in her work.<br /><br />While the book is an enjoyable interlude, there is an underlying loneliness to it, as Nin fights the sadness of being rejected for her work and her dedication to creating a reality that links intellect and emotion in a fiction that she finds truer than literary realism. \\" I have raged at the wall growing denser between myself and others. I do not want to be exiled, alone, cut off. I wept at being isolated, at the blockade of the publishers.\\" I found the book very interesting and readable. I recommend it.just crazy!\\" but Nin and Herlihy had a brief friendship with her, even though they had at first a deep visceral negative reaction to her.

US	52928260	R17WXZYA8WNUKY	0786711280	474513613	The Woman Who Wouldn't Talk: Why I Refused to Testify Against the Clintons and What I Learned in Jail	Books	3	18	20	N	N	Interesting human insight into the Whitewater trial	This book is an autobiography of McDougal, tracing her family life, her 8-year marriage at 20 to then 35-year-old Jim McDougal, her divorce, her ongoing conflict with the Office of the Independent Council in the investigation of Whitewater, her time in jail, her trial in California for theft from Zubin and Nancy Mehta, and the brief aftermath of her court- and jail-oriented life.<br /><br />Whatever the reader believes McDougal's guilt to be in Whitewater, Madison Guaranty and the Mehta cases, she seems to have a bigger problem of attaching herself to people who need her, but don't care about her. Her husband, an untreated manic-depressive for his adult life, was an entrepreneur, mostly, it seems, because he couldn't keep his attention on anything long enough to settle into a long-term endeavour. He was constantly starting up businesses, real estate deals and companies, banks and financial institutions, losing interest and committing himself to something else just when it was crunch time. Leaving Susan in charge against her will, and apparently against her natural abilities, the businesses would fail due to lack of attention and follow-through. According to the book, the Clinton investment in Whitewater, was a partnership in just such an undertaking. The $300,000 small business loan she signed for from David Hale, she writes, was another example of what she usually did: she did what Jim McDougal told her to do and believed it was the right thing to do. With Nancy Mehta, she writes, she again attached herself to someone needy and mercurial, and who would, when it suited her, turn on and betray the author out of spite and malice.<br /><br />The book traces the Whitewater investigation in some detail and Jim McDougal's part in the issues at hand, and I am not going to do that here. Where this book resonates is in how she seemed to be maliciously prosecuted by Starr and the OIC. They insisted that she offer them information on the Clintons, and if she did, they would give her \\"blanket immunity,\\" which included the Mehta charges in California. Though she considered giving them what they wanted to hear, others had and had been paid \\"walking around money,\\" etc., and had many of their crimes forgiven, a friend told her, \\"Susan, if you do this, you will be lying for the rest of your life.\\" And that's why she went to jail for civil contempt for 18 months and then withstood a trial on criminal contempt after the impeachment trial of Clinton was over.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this book was highlighted to me when I told a friend about what I was reading, and he said, \\"Why would she testify against her friends?\\" People seem to have an idea that she was staunchly protecting the Clintons, who were her close friends, but that is not the case, according to her book. She knew them through Jim McDougal, who'd been an Arkansas political operative, but she was not close to either Bill or Hillary. She does not maintain contact with them after her marriage, and, frankly, never got along that well with Hillary, whom she found to be withdrawn and perhaps cold at times. She heard about her presidential pardon for the Whitewater guilty verdicts on television. She refused to testify, not to help them but because she felt it would be wrong for her to lie to the OIC to save herself, because she didn't know anything that the Clintons had done wrong, and because she had seen what the OIC did to people who didn't testify in the way that they wanted (perjury charges, etc.).<br /><br />The time that McDougal spent in jail is well detailed and focuses on the women in jail and their sad situations. She found most of the women to have come from violent and sexually abusive situations, where they had left home or been taken from their homes and had become a kind of detritus of humanity. She writes movingly of the sad case of an Arkansas woman who was convicted of killing her children and was executed, presenting a human and loving picture of the mother, that reminded me of Sister Helen Prejean's Dead Man Walking.<br /><br />This is all an underlying theme to McDougal's book, her religious beliefs based on love and charity, rather than heavy \\"justice\\" and judgment. The religious hypocrisy of the OIC attorneys and associates sickens her, as they make \\"the walkin' around folks'\\" lives miserable and then speak in press interviews about how they pray whilst jogging, etc. Whatever you think of McDougal, that she was a serial grifter, that she hooked on too hard to people who weren't worthy of trust and was manipulated, that she is \\"spinning\\" her own part in all these issues, a lively and compelling portrait of a woman who cares for \\"the least among us\\" surfaces in this book in an amazing way.<br /><br />Because I live in Arkansas, I found the book to be loaded with \\"local color\\" and information.

(Gus) Gaynor so that I could evaluate it for use in a course I'm teaching next semester. Since one of my coures objectives is to switch the mindset of students from that of tacticians to that of managers, I thought this would be a good way to start.<br /><br />The book is an easy 229-page read, and with bulleted summaries and lists in larger type, the book is also easily scannable, especially for those who might read it \\"from the back\\" primarily (through indexed entries on specific topics).<br /><br />Gaynor begins the book with a likely scenario for the reader: YOU have just been promoted at your organization to head a team or division, and you have until Monday morning to prepare yourself for the work of a manager. He stresses that management is a profession, with necessary core knowledge areas and skills and abilities, just as is the speciality from which you were promoted. The chapters of the book include:<br /><br />1. Getting Started as a Manager<br /><br />2. The Seven Management Hats<br /><br />3. Making the Critical People Decisions<br /><br />4. Managing Individual and Team Relationships<br /><br />5. Project Management<br /><br />6. Finding the Time and Doing the Work<br /><br />7. Leadership and Communications<br /><br />8. Thinking your Way to Success<br /><br />9. Measuring your Chances of Success<br /><br />10. Managing your Career<br /><br />Several main ideas of Gaynor's focus on the ethical and people-oriented aspects of management. He states several times that managers do not manage people; they manage activities. Also, when writing about promotion and job assignments, he states that a manager can ruin someone's career by giving him or her the wrong assignment. Change agents aren't good at maintenance and vice-versa. If you give such a person responsibilities their natural talents don't lend themselves to, you could be dead-ending a perfectly good, contributing member of the organization. He also deals with leadership issues interestingly, and the notes sections at the end of each chapter offer other interesting reads, such as Senge's The Fifth Discipline and Henry Mintzberg's \\"The Manager's Job: Folklore and Fact,\\" from the Harvard Business Review.<br /><br />I don't know that I will have my students read every chapter. The section on project management may be a little too detailed and contextual for students in a seminar, but I think the last chapter on self-assessment of managerial abilities is a good way to start them off on their consideration of their own strengths and weaknesses. I wished I had had this book when I first became the boss of people! It underscored some of my instincts (like never to be disrespectful to your employees) and provided sound reasoning for alternate points of view.<br /><br />If you want more applied knowledge for new managers, want to improve your management skills or want to teach a class for new managers, I recommend this book, published by the American Management Association. Gaynor, who lives in Minneapolis, worked as a manager for more than 24 years at 3M and now has his own consulting firm.He also deals with leadership issues interestingly, and the notes sections at the end of each chapter offer other interesting reads, such as Senge's The Fifth Discipline and Henry Mintzberg's \\"The Manager's Job: Folklore and Fact,\\" from the Harvard Business Review.  <br /> <br />I don't know that I will have my students read every chapter.

Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life	Books	5	18	21	N	N	A Compelling Way to Tell These Stories	Though the pioneer of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud and theologian Lewis never met (at least there is no record of such a meeting), the author, a clinical psychiatrist and an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, thought it would be interesting to position Freud's \\"materialist\\" views against Lewis's later Christian beliefs -- as well as the effects on their lives. The book grew out of Nicholi's \\"popular course\\" at Harvard on the two men's<br /><br />philosophies.<br /><br />Nicholi uses letters and the published writings of Lewis and Freud and his own conclusions drawn from their lives to show the differences in a life in which the person chooses faith and belief and the life of someone who chooses not to believe. He traces the courses of their lives in tandem from childhoods, through adulthood, careers, marriages, families and even how they approached death (one of the most fascinating details was what Lewis read right before he died versus what Freud read -- Homer and Les Liaisons Dangereuses for Lewis and Balzac's The Fatal Skin for Freud). The biographical information on both<br /><br />men is fascinating, and it obviously focuses on the evolution of their belief systems. Both Lewis and Freud were atheists as young men, and the author posits that it was a reaction to authority. While Freud flirted with  belief in God as a young man, he adopted a firm stance against the existance of a god.<br /><br />Lewis, reacting to his unsatisfactory relationship with his father after his mother's death when he was still a school boy, chose atheism for a time, and then had a conversion experience, partly brought about by a long talk with colleagues, including J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />The book does take a position on the issue and points to faith as a help and support in life's troubles, highlighting the difference in relationships between Lewis and Freud (Lewis had lifelong friendships; Freud's friendships usually came to conflict and ended abruptly) and the way they faced their own deaths (Lewis wrote to a friend, \\"When you die, look me up ... It IS all rather fun--solemn fun--isn't it\\" (p. 237). Freud was anxious, depressed and sad about his pending death.)<br /><br />The book is deeply enjoyable and rewarding, and its portrayal of both Lewis and Freud as complex human beings is unexpectedly touching. It made me want to read more about Lewis, and I have put books about him and his autobiography, as well as his book about the death of his wife Joy (portrayed in the movie \\"Shadowlands\\") on my wishlist. As a Christian, I was rewarded by the position of the book, but I don't think atheists would agree. However, regarding both men's life and work, the author makes very clear the contributions each made to our world, including the bearing that Freud's theories have had on things we just accept as true today.nd the way they faced their own deaths (Lewis wrote to a friend, \\"When you die, look me up ...

Books	4	8	10	N	N	A complete and well written mosaic of the causes of WWI	EUROPE'S LAST SUMMER: WHO STARTED THE GREAT WAR IN 1914? by David Fromkin is an accessible, complete narrative of the various factions, individuals and national situations that contributed to the beginning of Austria's war on Serbia and World War I in 1914.<br /><br />Yes, I distinguish two different wars, as that is part of Fromkin's thesis, that it wasn't one war, but two, based on two separate agendas, and Fromkin goes so far in the final chapters to lay the blame for the war on the doorsteps of specific individuals in Austria and Germany, based on recently discovered documents and other historical records.<br /><br />This book, which deals only with what (who) started the war, seeks to refute the idea that the Great War broke out of nowhere in a clear and pleasant European summer, and/or was the result of war plans that once begun could not be stopped. Fromkin follows issues from the Franco-Prussian war in the 1870s and the unification of Germany under Bismarck, also in the later 1800s, to the declarations of war in the summer of 1914 among Germany, Russia, Great Britain, France, Austria, Serbia, Italy, Belgium, etc., etc.<br /><br />I love the way Fromkin depicts the mosaic of economic, political, social and xenophobic issues that cause the blaze of war in August 1914. While the assasination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is the oft-cited reason for the war (that's what I learned in 7th grade social studies with Mrs. Johnson), his death (by a \\"lucky\\"<br /><br />Gavrilo Princip, whose coconspirators missed or pulled out with their bombs and guns) was the pretense for Austria to start its much desired war against Serbia in an effort to quash Russian influence in the Balkans, where it had just annexed  Bosnia-Hercegovina from the Ottoman Empire. Ironically, according to Fromkin, Princip shot one of the two men who didn't want war against Serbia. By shooting Franz Ferdinand, Princip made it more likely that Austria would attack.<br /><br />The other person who originally consistently came down on the side of peace was the German ruler, Kaiser Wilhelm II. But he was increasingly marginalized by his civil and military government administrators, and his reluctance to go to war was put aside by his emotional reaction to the death of Franz Ferdinand. (The Kaiser seems to have been the only person in Europe who had any affection for the unlikeable archduke.) With these two influential parties out of the way, Austria-Hungary was free to proceed with its plan to wipe Serbia off the map, and Germany was free to declare the war it had  wanted for years -- with<br /><br />Russia and France.<br /><br />Ironically, the German military establishment knew, based on a situation in Morocco shortly before, that Austria would not be there for them, should they go to war against Russia, so strategists there were waiting for a scenario in which Austria was the wronged party, so that Germany could go to war in her favor, as her ally. When the archduke was assasinated, the situation presented itself, but according to Fromkin, Germany<br /><br />expected Austria to subvert its own war with Serbia -- because Austria was to have squashed Serbia one-on-one ASAP after the June 28 assasination, and didn't -- and send its troops to the Russian front so that Germany could invade France through Belgium and Luxembourg. In fact, it was Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium that pulled Great Britain into the war, which shortly<br /><br />before sw itself as removed from all issues.<br /><br />Fromkin's position that WWI shaped world politics for the entire 20th century (an idea I first read by him in KOSOVO CROSSING) is born out by his work here, and this book makes me want to read his best-known work, A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East. This book is accessible, clearly laid-out, rational, set well in<br /><br />context and fascinating. I highly recommend this book.iginally consistently came down on the side of peace was the German ruler, Kaiser Wilhelm II.

In fact, it was Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium that pulled Great Britain into the war, which shortly <br />before sw itself as removed from all issues. <br /> <br />Fromkin's position that WWI shaped world politics for the entire 20th century (an idea I first read by him in KOSOVO CROSSING) is born out by his work here, and this book makes me want to read his best-known work, A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East. This book is accessible, clearly laid-out, rational, set well in <br />context and fascinating. I highly recommend this book.	2004-09-27

The setting, the barrenness of the main characters' social and personal lives and the apparent presence of the devil in the book combine to make this a depressing -- and engaging -- read by Greene, one of the master writers of the internal and spiritual landscape.<br /><br />Henry Scobie is a police officer passed over for promotion for commissioner in a west African coastal colony of the British Empire in the twentieth century. The setting of the novel is indicative of the oppressive spiritual crisis that is to build and explode for Scobie throughout the course of the novel. The colony is either baking in heat or inundated with rains. At the end of each season, the characters seem about to go mad for want of the next, only to repeat the cycle of exhaustion. There are rats, cockroaches and other assorted irritating and dangerous creatures everywhere, in the houses and hotel rooms, in the baths, everywhere. Malaria hits Scobie early on, and we can see from his casual decision to \\"sweat it out\\" while on a trip to investigate a suicide that it's not an unusual occurrence. The pain of the landscape is exacerbated by WWII and the allegiances and enemies it creates in a faraway land as well as its rendering of normal activities, like writing and carrying letters for post, as crimes. This is a miserable, miserable place to be.<br /><br />But Scobie seems to like it; he is comfortable in this landscape. He, unlike his wife, is not ambitious, and is not unhappy about being passed over for promotion. However, he does worry about the effect this has on his wife, Louise. His love for her is anything but idealized, if it even is love. He seems more to pity her than anything else and feels the burden to provide for her happiness however he can very deeply. They are both devoutly Catholic, and have lost a daughter in their marriage, their only child. Scobie, who writes \\"just the facts\\" in his diary every night noted their daughter's death with only, \\"C. died.\\" against that day's date.<br /><br />In an effort to provide for his wife's happiness, Scobie borrows money from a man of dubious character, Yusef, a Syrian merchant living in the colony who seems to be often under police surveillance. The money is spent to send Louise to South Africa. Both Scobie and Louise know that she is not liked in the colony and has few friends except for a new clerk, Wilson, who is not really welcomed at the club due to his lowly status. Wilson is in love with Louise and hates Scobie for not valuing her as he does (in idealizing her and his feelings).<br /><br />It is in his dealings with Louise that we first see that Scobie is sadly unable to estimate her understanding of him and their relationship accurately. He always seems surprised when she guesses what he is thinking or when she knows he is lying to her about his feelings, etc. And yet they have been married some years. The reader starts to see that Scobie's view of others is (humanly) inaccurate and serves his own purposes of pity and concern more than it serves the future of any close relationship.<br /><br />While Louise is gone, Scobie is called to a rescue site of some boat passengers who were victims of a German sea attack. Many tragically die, but one woman, who looks like a child as she is carried into his life on a stretcher clutching only a stamp album, becomes a new love interest to Scobie. Helen Rolt has lost her husband in the attack, and after her recovery is living in the colony waiting to return to England or move on somewhere else, and Scobie, in his efforts to care for her -- she was such a heartbreaking vision -- falls in love with her and starts an affair.<br /><br />It isn't long before we can see the same patterns in his relationship with Helen that we see with Louise. He says he loves her -- and seems to -- and yet his love is played out only by promises he doubts he can fulfill and pitied concern. Again he underestimates his lovers' perception of realit; again he seems to have taken on a burden, rather than a companion; again he seems to be more lonely in the relationship than outside of it. And yet he craves it and cannot let it go. Even when Louise returns.<br /><br />Scobie's spiritual life matters to him, and he, a policeman, is very concerned with the law,  and struggles to cope with meeting the laws of his Christianity while pleasing and helping the two women he says he loves, neither of which seem to understand him completely, though they \\"get\\" him more than he seems to get them. In further dealings with Yusef, real and palpable evil comes into the story in a manner as oppressive as the weather and the climate. While Scobie seems to be succeeding in Louise's ambitions, he struggles more and more with meeting the law of his Catholicism while not hurting Louise or Helen.<br /><br />The sad and tragic aspect of Scobie is that he sees the rules of his religious life more clearly than he sees the love and grace it is to provide for him. Just as in his relationships with women, he underestimates what God knows and understands about him and might do for him if asked. He takes on all the responsibility of the pain and loneliness and the evil of this place, while never seeking assistance. The pain of the last chapters is unrelenting, though a small bit of hope and grace is articulated by one of the characters toward the end. I'm clinging to these few words, or I'd lose all my hope myself.mises he doubts he can fulfill and pitied concern.

I've long been interested in Balkan history, particularly since reading Rebecca West's Black Lamb and Grey Falcon in 1996.<br /><br />So, I was pleased when this book began with a focus on West's book, her time in Yugoslavia before World War II, and the genuine attachment others who study and/or love this region have for her work and thoughts on the Balkans. Quoting Robert D. Kaplan, author of another well-known work on the region, Balkan Ghosts, Fromkin illustrates the influence West's work has had on writers following in her footsteps, when he writes that he would have rather lost his passport and his money than his copy of Black Lamb.<br /><br />While all of West's information and her work on the subject is no longer accepted today, Fromkin's respect for this book that has so influenced me attracted to me to his work, and kept me very engaged in the few days it took me to read this 196-page book, which is really an extended essay on the ways in which World War I shaped the twentieth century in Europe, and how President Woodrow Wilson's response to \\"the Great War\\" has continued to shape American foreign policy in that same time period.<br /><br />Copyrighted in 1999, this work does not report a resolution on Kosovo. (In the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the Serbs initiated ethnic cleansing techniques to rid the Kosovo province of its majority of ethnic Albanians - of 2,000,000 residents of the region, only 200,000 were not ethnic Albanians.) But by the end of the book, this seemed secondary to the points raised and argued by Fromkin, and the reality of the situation today supports Fromkin's thesis. (The region is still being administered by the United Nations, or that human rights organizations are calling for continuing protection.)<br /><br />In the line of this book, Kosovo (or Kosova, to its Albanian residents) is the latest iteration of Wilsonian foreign policy. The book begins with a retelling of West's experiences at Kosovo Polje (Field of the Blackbirds), at which she saw a sacrifice of a lamb by a father in thanks for the birth of his daughter. This place matters so much to the Serbs because it is the (mythical?) site of the 1389 decisive battle in which the Serbian leader, Tsar Lazar, bargained with heaven that he would lose the battle with the Ottomans and gain eternity in heaven. Such a sacrifice grated on West, who was looking in the late 1930s at another great war on the Continent. The lamb's sacrifice and Lazar's, whose personal aggrandizement for eternity left the Balkan peninsula submerged under Ottoman rule for nearly as long, was just wrong to West. She rejected the idea of sacrifice as necessary for good categorically.<br /><br />And West wondered, pondering Kosovo, why the people who were good were reluctant to use their power to effect good in the world, while those willing to use power, rarely had good intentions. She wondered why the right would not impose their rightness through the use of their power.<br /><br />Through his discussion of the twentieth century in Europe and America, including discussions of Vietnam, Iraq I and Korea, Fromkin frames his ideas under the Wilsonian doctrine of preserving existing national boundaries (even at the cost, it would seem, of his other overarching concept, self-determination for nations). My reading of Fromkin leads me to believe that George H.W. Bush didn't push on to Baghdad as part of this belief of preserving national boundaries, and using force to defend either the vital interests of the nation or the existing boundaries of another country. This seemed to structure the Americans' response in Korea, as well. The problem, Fromkin states, with this is that not only do you have to leave troops there to defend the borders once you fight to reinstate them, but also you end up subverting the natural flow of history by propping up nations who cannot do the thing that all self-sustaining nations do, which is protect their identity and boundaries successfully. (In Kosovo, a foreign power could conceivably have found itself fighting both sides of a civil war by disagreeing with the Kosovars about independence and disagreeing with the Serbs about allowing the Albanian Kosovars to live there.)<br /><br />Studying the Balkans has taught me how fluid national boundaries are in our world, and that the region is a fascinating illustration of the forces of European politics and power in microcosm. Fromkin seems to share this view. But in his examination of what the answer to the Kosovo ethnic cleansing crisis might have been was where we parted ways, though I was absolutely enamored of his study of the century and the political realities and ideologies that shaped our responses to foreign aggression since World War I.<br /><br />Fromkin writes that it is possible that if there had been no intervention, the Serbs would have banished and murdered the Kosovar Albanians, and though horrible, the issue would have been settled and \\"it would all be over.\\"<br /><br />Fromkin apparently advocates a \\"Red Cross\\" approach to human catastrophes, including genocide, by praising the organization for not taking sides, caring for the needy, resettling them where they are allowed to go (instead of where force has disallowed them). While he found Americans willing to send million-dollar bombs to crush $10,000 Serb tanks, he found them less willing to help individual Kosovar families. He says that it is \\"morally inconsistent\\" to use force on humanitarian grounds but not allow Kosovars to settle in our neighborhoods when what they most need is a place to live freely. However, I think, to stand aside and watch while a government machine displaces 90 percent of a region's long-time population through systematic murder and rape, is not humanitarian either. While I don't think Fromkin's solution would be successful in the world (it wouldn't be \\"over,\\" would it?), he successfully illustrates a dark side of the problem, that we are more willing to use force for goodness than goodness for goodness. We are asserting our power for good, but we are not being really good doing it.<br /><br />This book is a useful tool to understanding U.S. foreign policy around the globe, not just in Kosovo, and it is more about the twentieth century iterations of that policy (and its birth) than about Kosovo alone.

It was more engaging than I thought it would be, and now that I know it better, I will keep it handy for when I read any works by Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy, Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, George Eliot and William Thackeray. Pool uses examples from novels as the rule (with occasional actual events as illustrative material) so that those familiar with these works can see what these events meant to the author and original readers of such novels as Mansfield Park, The Eustace Diamonds, Oliver Twist, Vanity Fair, Jude the Obscure and Middlemarch.<br /><br /> The book is divided into two parts: the first of 255 pages, is the basic text, divided into sections by topic (such as &quot;Public Life,&quot; &quot;Private Life&quot; and &quot;The Grim World&quot;), which is the section you can sit down to read, and then say to your significant other, &quot;Wow! Did you know that there were more than 200 offenses in early 19th century Britain punishable by death, including stealing from a shop?&quot; and, &quot;Women alternated which side they rode side-saddle on to avoid developing an overly enhanced buttock!&quot; The last 135 pages of the book comprise a glossary of terms like &quot;ague&quot; and &quot;ha-ha&quot; (which I looked up while reading Mansfield Park recently-- it is a sunken fence used as an invisible landscaping device).<br /><br /> The first section (the text sections) is easy and interesting to read, and I loved having examples from Austen and Middlemarch used, because I've read most of Austen and that one George Eliot novel. The best thing, I think, about the book is that it provides a wonderful context for 19th-century British fiction and makes me want to read Hardy, Trollope, and even Dickens, in whom I have not had much interest before. Also, I enjoyed learning the origins of terms common in our language and culture, like what &quot;the bar&quot; originally was in the structure of English law, and that the term &quot;pub&quot; comes from &quot;public house.&quot; I also found some of the class strictures fascinating, such as how it was considered absurd to have footmen who were not the same height, and how a host and hostess would have to line all their guests up for dinner and pair them off according to rank. This, obviously, was a minefield of possible offenses and social disasters for those doing the pairings!<br /><br /> The fault I have with the book is minor, and that is that because it is written, it seems, primarily as a reference book, even the text sections can be a little repetitive, mentioning some fact in several places because it is relevant in more than one context. Also, it just kind of, bang!, starts with a section on money and, bang!, ends with a section on funerals, with no transitional or ending text, aside from a brief, spearate introduction by the author at the beginning. I think some might fault the author for trying to cover an entire century (think of the differences in culture and daily routine from 1901 and 1999), but I felt this was not a weakness: with the use of the novels' range in publication, he is able to make distinctions and give a gloss of the history and culture of the century that is useful for the his purposes.<br /><br /> But I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes the above-mentioned authors and novels or to anyone who would like to read them.

Under Drakulic's hand, this stops being a political abstraction of battling ideas (pan-Slavism vs. independent nation states), but a physical and psychological hardship of the intimate and emotionally scarring, deadly violence and nihilistic realities of war in one's own neighborhood.<br /><br /> While this book -- published in the nid 1990s, with essays dating from July 1991 to January 1994, through the complete Croatian war of secession and the beginning and continuation of the war in Bosnia that killed 200,000 and displaced millions -- is somewhat dated for us now that we know of the end of the war in the former Yugoslavia, the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina (and the eventual war in Kosovo), the timelessness of the ideas she expresses about war seems as if it would always be salient, especially now as the United States has soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br /><br /> Drakulic, who also wrote Cafe Europa and S: A Novel about the Balkans, details the outcomes of war, sometimes unexpected, sometimes not. While she mentions violent and ghastly images of war (a young couple of lovers, a Serb and a Bosnian, who have obtained permission to leave Sarajevo for Belgrade are shot in the no-man's land outside the city on their officially permitted leave-taking, the bodies left in the grass for days), she dwells more on the psychological understanding of war in one's own country, one's own city, one's own neighborhood. (&quot;My friend in Paris who moved there when she was 10 years old, at the end of the Algerian war, told me that her teacher had asked her why, even after years of living in France, she walked down a street zig-zag. This is how you walk to avoid a bullet, she explained to her teacher. And this is what the generation of children who survived a war in Croatia will do, walk zig-zag and run to hide in cellars at the sound of aeroplane.&quot;)<br /><br /> Drakulic notices that war became real to her in small, personal moments of realization, such as when she sent her college-age daughter from Zagreb to live in Canada with her Serbian father, and saw that her daughter was taking clothes for all year round and her worn, stuffed, childhood stuffed-animal companion, in case she couldn't come back. She sees how she herself judges a refugee friend negatively for wearing fancy shoes and makeup, realizing that she has an underlying belief that a refugee should have no joy. She notes how the war follows refugees wherever they go; the war follows her to Slovenia, a famous Croatian actress to New York and her friends to Paris in their thinking and values. She writes about the shock she feels when she meets a young man, a soldier from Vukovar, in Zagreb after the city fell to the Serbs, who was so young, she can't get past what he's been through for his age.<br /><br /> A recurring theme of the book is how the war has taken a pluralistic nation of apolitical people (in her generation, born in the 1950s), who didn't notice or care about who was Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, or their religions, Orthodox, Muslim and Catholic, respectively, and obliterated them as individuals in favor of categorizing them as Croatians, Bosnians and Serbs above all else, and refusing them the right of being their own persons and &quot;othering,&quot; as the literary critics say, those in different demographic categories, drafting them to kill those Others, or support the slaughter of those Others because their lives now depend on it.<br /><br /> This book is highly effective in helping one see what it would be like to have war break out within 100 miles of you, and come nearer every day. Though Drakulic writes that the war in the Balkans can be held, emotionally, at a distance by Europeans (&quot;the 'other' is the lawless 'Balkans' they pretend not to understand&quot;) and by Americans (&quot;For the USA it's more or less a 'European problem'), she destroys any complacency the reader might feel as far away in time and space from the Balkans with her highly intimate and moving glimpses into the psychological horrors of war in a world more like ours than it is different.he lawless 'Balkans' they pretend not to understand&quot;) and by Americans (&quot;For the USA it's more or less a 'European problem'), she destroys any complacency the reader might feel as far away in time and space from the Balkans with her highly intimate and moving glimpses into the psychological horrors of war in a world more like ours than it is different. <br />	2004-07-28

THE CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is one of the strangest novels I've ever read, but that translates as meaning, also, \\"fabulously original.\\" I had no idea what to expect, and I will admit from the first paragraph until the final moments, I had not idea what was coming next, who would do what, and what the whole point would be. I was grateful for an understanding of classic comedy because putting it into the context of that genre, the characters freeing themselves from their constrictions, and the rejuvenation in the end of one of them, helps to give structure to the mass of this.<br /><br /> But this book is STRANGE, even with that window of understanding. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly is the anti-hero of anti-heros. He is in no way likeable. He is slovenly, selfish, dismissive, judgmental, insulting, egoistic, superior and a blow-hard. Most of the other characters don't seem much better. Though his mother is long-suffering at the hands of Ignatius, she isn't blameless in the way he's turned out or in the way the two of them proceed as a family. Ignatius's ex-girlfriend, who is now his pen-pal of blame and pessimism, is self-righteous about her never-ending causes, but it is clear to see that she is in it for her personal gratification and cares very little for the actual people she is supposed to be helping. After several chapters, I burst out in frustration, \\"Why are we reading this book? These people are vile!\\" But the wildly careening plot, the characterizations and the humor kept me going until the end.<br /><br /> The plot seems to move from the point at which Ignatius's mother got in a car accident at the beginning of the book after Ignatius barely eludes capture by the police for being \\"a suspicious character.\\" Due to financial straits, Ignatius must earn money to pay of the bills for the accident. He tries his hand at two separate jobs, each time interpreting the positions in his own Ignatius J. Reilly way, and each time coming up with a bizarre turn of failure.<br /><br /> This book is FUNNY. There are some things in here I will continue to refer to, such as Ignatius's sayings: When he is shocked by something, he bellows, \\"Do I believe what I am hearing?\\" and when he is upset with someone's behavior, he hollers, \\"She must be lashed!\\"<br /><br /> It's a sloshing whiz-bang (though oxymoronical, I think that fits this book) of a novel. I recommend it.ng up with a bizarre turn of failure. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> This book is FUNNY.

I think there is no technical virtuouso like Plath in poetry, no one with her emotional compass and her intuitive impact. The woman was a stunningly brilliant poet (and her novel The Bell Jar is a fabulous evil twin Skippy to Bridget Jones).<br /><br /> I have just finished reading the 670-some pages of her unabridged journals, published in the United States in 2000 for the first time. I had read her abridged journals during college, and I remember nothing like the impact that comes here. And now that I am done, I feel kind of grieved in a new way for the loss of her, a fresh hurt.<br /><br /> The book is divided into sections based on her notebooks or journals that include Plath's adult journals from 1950 to 1962, and is an exact transcription of her writing, including errors and notes on edits she made or that her husband, the late British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes may have made, in the original manuscripts. The unabridged version comprises sections from the following years: July 1950 to July 1953; November 1955 to April 1956; July 1956; July 1956 to August 1956; January 1957 to March 1957; July 1957 to August 1957; August 1957 to October 1958; and December 1958 to November 1959. The 15 appendices contain journal fragments and entries starting from October 1951 to 1962. And the phases of her life included are some of her years as an undergraduate at Smith, her time at Newnham College, Cambridge, as a Fulbright Scholar, her honeymoon in Spain with Ted Hughes, her married life with Hughes in Cambridge, her life with Hughes as university instructors in Massachusetts, her life with Hughes as freelance writers in Massachusetts, and some of the appendices include journal entries made when they lived in England before their marriage ended. Shortly before he died, Hughes unsealed two of her journals, which are published here for the first time, that contain her notes on her therapy in Massachusetts shortly before they moved to England. (Two journals from the end of their marriage and written at the end of her life are not included. One, according to Hughes has been missing since Plath's death, the other he destroyed after her death to spare their two children, Frieda and Nicholas Hughes.)<br /><br /> I think it's important to note what is missing here before I write about what is included. Those looking for &quot;G&quot; on her college-age suicide attempt won't find it. While some of Plath's dark mood shortly before her attempt in August 1953 is recorded, nothing specifically about that event was written, and Plath didn't keep a journal for up to two years after that. The missing and destroyed journals mentioned above were written during the time of the discovery of Hughes's affair, the end of their marriage and the months she lived in London shortly before her suicide there in February 1963. The one Hughes destroyed contained entries up to three days before her suicide.<br /><br /> And what is missing isn't missed, I think. What you get instead of the sensationalism and scandal are the real workings and pressures of the ambitious, 1950s coming-of-age, conflicted, smart, needy woman that Plath was. Her ambitions are tremendous, and the pressures on her internally and externally match them. Her mother's pressure to find a secure job conflicts with Plath's need to be free of such constraints to really try to write. But when she has the time, she is scared of writing because she fears failure. And so on.<br /><br /> Aside from seeing how she works, processes ideas, plans stories, copes with challenges and rejoices over triumps, Plath is interesting for the time in which she came of age in the 1950s -- a spectacularly Smith-and-Cambridge educated young woman who knows that a role is wife and mother is dictated to her. Her marriage means an immeasurable amount to her -- she recounts how lucky she feels that she could meet someone she admires so much as Ted and marry him. And she wants him to succeed first; she thinks it will be easier at home if he does, but one can see the tension that causes her, as she so deeply wants to succeed as well. &quot;Dangerous to be so close to Ted day in day out. I have no life separate from his, am likely to become a mere accessory. Important to take German lessons, go out on my own, think work on my own. Lead separate lives. I must have a life that supports me inside&quot; (p. 524).<br /><br /> There is a constant theme in the later journals, curiously, of her writing that she needs to learn German. She is constantly instructing herself to study German. Learn German. Read German. It's bizarre to the reader of the journals who cannot connect that with her overarching goals of being a prize-winning, published successful writer of both poetry and prose. But she constantly reminds herself of what she has yet not succeeded at and what she must do to meet her goals. (And her father spoke German and died when she was 8, and one cannot deny that obvious connection.)<br /><br /> The chronological sections each have their own definite characters, as Plath becomes more independent and more skilled. One that really stands out with what I term Plath's &quot;psychotic verve&quot; is the December 1958 to November 1959 journals that she wrote as a means of working through her therapy sessions and making the most of them. The first entry is the reaction to her therapist telling her, &quot;I give you permission to hate your mother.&quot; One can see the roots of some of her later, famous poems in these paragraphs as she slogs through the family sacred things and norms, challenges them and tests her own strength against those mores. An interesting journal entry from this time includes the day on which she was FINALLY finished teaching at Smith and could be free to write creatively nearly full-time, and cannot find Ted, who was supposed to meet her. At last she saw him, walking up from a pond with a young, flirty Smith student. She was furious. What is fascinating about the entry is how she takes the time to completely set up the situation, writing about the whole day with purposeful foreshadowing incidents, building up the suspense of the moment so that the reader may experience her disappointment, suspicion and anger, too.<br /><br /> The final section, Appendix 15, includes character sketches of her neighbors in North Tawton, Devon, England, and recounts her and Ted's and the children's lives as far as they come in contact with the people with whom she interacts there. The section includes a detailed description of the birth of her son, Nicholas, and the story of the death of one of her neighbors. As the last entry, it is poignant.<br /><br /> And to spend this much intimate time with Plath, and then to get to the end, see that the marriage broke up shortly after the last entry, and that she was dead not long after that is a new, and painful experience, because one gets to know her in a real, time-consuming way through these pages.

He eats the sandwich, pulls out a gun, and shoots the waiter dead. As the panda stands up to go, the manager shouts, &quot;Hey! Where are you going? You just shot my waiter, and you didn't even pay for your sandwich!&quot;<br />&quot;Hey, man, I'm a PANDA!&quot; the panda shouts back. &quot;Look it up!&quot;<br />The manager opens his dictionary and reads:<br />Panda: A tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin, characterized by distinct black and white coloring. Eats, shoots and leaves.<br />The comma in the punchline is exactly the kind of misplaced punctuation that drives Truss to distraction, and her efforts to protect the English language from similar abuse were the impetus for this book. In an early chapter, Truss advocates punctuation guerillas to go out and about and take care of things like the missing apostrophe in the &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; movie posters.<br />While it's not a reference book or an exhaustive guide, EATS, SHOOTS AND LEAVES provides a funny general guideline for punctuation along with a charming history of related language, printing and linguistic traditions and standards. (For example, do you know what an &quot;interrobang&quot; is, or the meaning of the meaning of the word &quot;hypen&quot; in its orginal Greek?) Truss forms chapters thematically around various punctuation marks, outlines their uses and gives practical and humorous examples. The last chapter addresses the electronic age's influence on writing and punctuation.<br />This would be a good book to own, as it is very quotable and the sources Truss uses to make her case and inform readers of the why's and wherefore's are a good resource for interested parties. While I was aware of most of the rules of which Truss writes, I was very interested in this kind of linguistical lesson.<br />One caveat I have about the book is that it is a British book, so some rules aren't consistent with standard American English. Also Truss doesn't follow my preferred AP style, as I noted when she wrote &quot;email&quot; instead of &quot;e-mail,&quot; &quot;internet&quot; instead of &quot;Internet&quot; and &quot;website&quot; instead of &quot;Web site.&quot; So, as I said, it's not a style guide, but it's an enjoyable, generally informative guide for those who love language, like to read about it and like to know there's someone else out there who notices signs like &quot;book's for sale&quot; and cringes.d parties.

For anyone who may be doing graduate study in the social sciences and is interested in qualitative research, this is a GREAT place to start.<br />My friend suggested this book to me when my thesis adviser told me to get a book on qualitative research as I was trying to design my study of a newspaper and its relationships with strategic publics. In this book Creswell clearly and logically lays out five different qualitative research traditions (1. a biographical life history; 2. a phenomenology; 3. a grounded theory study; 4, an ethnography; and 5. a case study). Creswell guides researchers on the rationale for each method, the design, and corresponding data collection, analysis and narrative report, while giving ample references for further reading in one's chosen tradition. Particularly helpful are the appendices that include example studies of each methodology.<br />I needed other sources to supplement what I learned here, but this book really gave me an excellent foundation with which to proceed. I recommend it to anyone who is trying to design a qualitative study and isn't sure where to start.	2004-07-09

The BOOK itself serves as the city, the protection and community of good women who show that the defamatory collective statements about women (they are greedy, they are inconstant, they are not chaste, etc.) are not true.<br /><br />De Pizan was born in 1365 in Venice. When she was a small child, the French King Charles V gave her father a position at his court (he served as astrologer). The family's close ties to the court afforded Christine a good education, which was unusual at the time (and opposed by her mother). Though the family's fortunes faded, Christine made a happy marriage and had three children. When her husband died in 1389, de Pizan turned to writing to make her living. She became a highly respected voice on the status of women.<br /><br />The book is structured around three ladies of heaven coming to visit Christine and charging her with building the City of Ladies. Christine has just been reading a book by Math&eacute;olus, who is deeply critical of womankind, and Christine is upset and discouraged. The women are Reason, Rectitude and Justice. While they help her build and populate the city, Christine asks them to defend womenkind against various charges she hears brought against women, and they do so, each getting her own book of the work. The responses are examples of women in history, some biblical, some historical, some mythological (but these are explained by the Christian Christine as being real women whose fame was so renowned that their societies thought they were goddesses and began to worship them). Interestingly, she retells some women's histories differently: Medea is a woman who deeply loved her husband, the same with Socrates' wife.<br /><br />The book has an extensive index, which is helpful, because one learns so much about so many different women. Nearly ever vignette could be turned into a novel, a la THE RED TENT. The section by Justice at the end is the most monotonous, as it is basically a Lives of the Saints about the virgin martyrs, and their stories are nearly all the same: Some man wants Virgin Martyr X. She doens't want him. He tricks and entreats her. She says no. He has her tortured (usually her breasts are pulled off). She withstands torture due to God's help (she sings out of a pot of boiling water into which she is placed head first; 12 men tire of beating her, but still she is unhurt). God calls her home and she dies happily.<br /><br />I think the first two sections (which are longer than the last) are very interesting historically and I was happy to read particularly of Lavinia and Margaret (my mother's names) and Anastasia (like my name). The Women of Heaven make the point often that men's behavior in the world puts them in no position to criticize women. The book would make a nice kind of \\"devotional\\" or meditative reading source, a woman for each day, or something like that, if you didn't want to read it all at once.<br /><br />The sad thing is that women, as a whole, still endure these ridiculous criticisms. If you tire, like Christine, of hearing these baseless charges, you may want to retire to the BOOK OF THE CITY OF LADIES.ed into a novel, a la THE RED TENT.

His premise is that fear is a means of survival and that if we listen to it and follow it, we can save our own and others' lives; however, for various reasons, we often discount our intuition about danger or we don't listen to our fear and put ourselves unnecessarily at risk.<br />The book begins with a &quot;true crime&quot; story about Kelly, a woman who was raped in her apartment by a man she met in her stairwell who offered to carry the groceries she had dropped up to her apartment. De Becker parses the incident and categorizes the methods the attacker employed to get her to do what he wanted and put herself under his control, and this section is very enlightening. But the main theme of this first chapter and the book is that men and women should follow their intuition -- intuition isn't some flighty, sixth sense; it's a call to action when your brain has become aware of many small signs that something isn't right, even if, at that moment, you cannot articulate exactly what is wrong.<br />This book is not a self-defense or how-to guide, but rather makes a case for intuition and believing in oneself when one senses danger or feels fear, and the best reading in it, I think, is the examples de Becker explicates from his many years in the security and risk-assessment business (he also lived through an exceedingly violent and abusive childhood). The chapters address being in the presence of danger, how intuition works and functions, the science of violence predictors, survival signals, violent crime from strangers, high-stakes predictions, understanding threats to kill, dealing with too-persistent people, violence in the workplace, domestic violence, dating abuses and violence, violent children, public figure attacks and pursuits and extreme cases.<br />I found several things particularly interesting and engaging about this book. First, de Becker states emphatically throughout the work that violence is predictable, and that no one ever &quot;just snaps&quot; or is just an inexplicably bad person. Second, his predictor of violence is a useful tool -- and I would think may be applicable in other assessment situations -- to make informed judgments on risk. Third, I got a great deal personally out of his comparisons of worry and anxiety with fear in which he suggest that the first two are destructive and distracting (and may prevent someone from spotting real danger signs), but that fear is what has saved many, many lives and could save your own. Fourth, his writing on people who are too persistent is very interesting, and he shows how people's attempts to deal with stalkers is often just going to keep the situation alive.<br />Finally, the chapter on domestic violence was absolutely fascinating, primarily because this is a man who deals in truth and reality, not romance and excuses. He states that when assessing relationships, women often make judgments based on potential rather than on the present situation, which causes them to ignore warning signs and predictive incidents. He also says that he is in the business of safety, not justice, and that because of that he isn't a supporter of restraining orders in all cases because in some, they aggravate the offender more and can actually be a precipitating incident toward murder or its attempt.<br />Toward the beginning of the book, de Becker writes about how men don't really understand the risk under which women constantly live, but that for women personal safety is a constant consideration. He writes, &quot;Men are worried that women will laugh at them. Women are worried that men will kill them.&quot; I learned a lot about listening to intuition, choosing not to worry and living safely.<br />I recommend this book, especially to women.ting and engaging about this book.

Oettinger, chairman of the Program on Information Resources Policy at Harvard, THE COMMUNICATIONS TOOLKIT: HOW TO BUILD AND REGULATE ANY COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS by P.H. Longstaff is not exactly light, recreational reading, but it's informative, well organized and insightful about the structure of information economies and how to apply information theory to forward-thinking communications business strategies and plans.<br />This book reminded me of INFORMATION RULES by Shapiro and Varian, which also deals with the economic systems of information businesses, but this is more in-depth and exhaustive. The &quot;tools&quot; of the kit are actually explanations of various theories and systems so that the reader may apply that knowledge in the new, growing and changing information economy. These tools are: new building blocks, a tool for networks, a tool for competition/cooperation, three visions of communications convergence, convergence theology, a tool for concentration/diversity, as well as chapters on regulation.<br />The most interesting chapters, to me, dealt with comparisons of biological systems to economic systems in explaining cooperation and competition, and &quot;Tool no. 5: Convergence Theology&quot; about the differing and business-shaping philosophies about the information superhighway. The final chapter is a useful summary and reference tool if you don't want to sit and read the entire book.<br />If you have an interest in information theory, telecommunications, telecommunications policy, Internet business applications and governmental information-economy policy, this will be helpful and informative to you.	2004-06-21
US	52928260	RLBANR00QXL4L	1400042070	669988222	The Amateur Marriage: A Novel	Books	4	4	6	N	N	An Elegant Portrait of a Difficult Marriage	THE AMATEUR MARRIAGE by Anne Tyler is a beautiful book about the lifetimes of two people after they meet around the time of Pearl Harbor. Michael is a diligent, handsome, considered young man, who works in his mother's grocery in the St. Cassian's neighborhood of Baltimore. Pauline is a beguiling, lively stranger (who lives just 20 minutes away), who's cut her head in a small mix-up in the crowd swell building around the declaration of war. They are instantly taken with each other; the story begins there and continues for their lifetimes, as they marry, have children, and experience their relationship in various iterations.<br /><br />I love the title of the book, the idea that people can be amateurs at marriage, and it comes from a character's reflections that the marriage of Michael and Pauline does not seem to get smoother or more in tune or more successful as the years go by. While others develop the ability to understand and grow closer, the two of them remain amateurs in a difficult and exhausting union. Pauline believes that everyone fights, and, anyway, it can be made better in the future. Michael is frustrated and saddened over the state of their lives together. They both wonder if they made a mistake in marrying in the first place.<br /><br />The book runs from the time of Pearl Harbor until after the destruction of the Trade Towers and tells a long story of this family, but it ingeniously does so through short snippets, almost individual short stories, snapshots taken at various points of the couple's lives from both their view points (as well as from the viewpoints of their children). Through this technique, Tyler communicates the sense that neither is to blame, that it is not the fault of one partner, that the marriage is unhappy. At each intersection the reader has with their lives, one gets to see a different and/or evolving vantage point. I came to the sad conclusion that the two had no empathy for each other, though they had, at times, genuine affection.<br />The thing I think I liked most about this book and the aspect with which I was most impressed from a writing viewpoint was the way that Tyler tells the story in these breaks over a lifetime. Through this method she is able to give appropriate weight to the drama-ramas that occur. Of course, things happen that are HUGE to the characters at the time (and many leave indelible marks), but through this method of setting, Tyler imparts that the incidents are moments in a long chain of linked incidents. There is a sense of real history of this couple here, a sense of real time passing. In some ways, it is as if their lives become the reader's memories. I felt real love for the characters, as well as anger, frustration, and hope.<br /><br />This book was expertly written, beautifully constructed, an elegant work. I absolutely recommend it.br />The thing I think I liked most about this book and the aspect with which I was most impressed from a writing viewpoint was the way that Tyler tells the story in these breaks over a lifetime.

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	4	6	N	N	An O'Neillian Analysis	This highly readable, instructive book lays open the administration of George W. Bush from a member of his own party. The interesting aspect of the book that emerges over time, however, isn't that Bush and former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill disagree so much over policy, it's that their values differ over how that policy is reached. This book is a fabulous case study in values clashing in organizational culture.<br />By the end of the book, I was deeply impressed and wanted to know more about O'Neill's way of working, analyzing, processing and implementing his strategies. I think we have a lot to learn from this man organizationally.<br />I recommend this book for those who like Washington insider stories, and also for those who are interested in organizational psychology and cultural issues.	2004-06-09

This book presents Alberto's unique eccentricities and habits, his moral code, his issues with women, and his friendships (which include Simone de Beauvoir, Andre Breton, Andre Derain, Pablo Picasso and Jean-Paul Sartre) in a complete and exhaustive manner. It also recounts his complicated and close relationship with his brother and collaborator Diego. It was truly illuminating about the life of such an incredible artist.<br />However, the writing style is pretentious and sometimes so &quot;writerly&quot; as to be opaque. Lord dissects the actions of the people he writes about in a sometimes pompous way, and he is none too kind to the women in Giacometti's life.<br />But I recommend this book to people interested in Giacometti, as well as to those who like to read about the Parisian intelligensia around WWII and into the 60s.	2004-06-09

When reading large sections in one sitting, I really felt the weight of the experience settle on me. The novel also begins to feel increasingly existentialist as the absurdity of the structures of war and death play out for the characters involved. During &quot;marathon&quot; reading sessions on three different days, I came to see this as a literary, &quot;real time&quot; adventure, as Hemingway details almost every moment in the characters' lives.<br /><br />The novel starts out with the protagonist, Robert Jordan, lying on the forest floor. Jordan, an American, is in Spain fighting on the side of the Republicans in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Jordan is apparently a &quot;code hero,&quot; a protagonist of Hemingway's who lives according to a code of behavior. He is a Spanish teacher from Montana who loves Spain, and is fighting, carrying out explosives missions, against the Fascists, who have a vast war machine.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, Robert Jordan is teamed up with a band of guerrilla fighters in the mountains near a bridge he must blow as part of a Republican offensive. Anselmo, an old man who knows the land well, helps Jordan scout the bridge. Other members of the band include Pablo, a formerly great fighter, we are told, who has now &quot;gone bad.&quot; He cares primarily for his horses. His &quot;woman&quot; Pilar is a leader of the band, and she narrates on the first full day that Jordan is with them how the Republicans rose up against the Fascists in her town. The story is brutal and demonstrates the atrocities committed by the Republicans in the war as they bludgeon the town's Fascists to save bullets. Others in the group include Agustin, Eladio, Andres, Fernando and Rafael, a Gypsy. And Maria. Maria is a young woman who was the victim of atrocities in her town. She was rescued by this band of Republicans and now lives with them in the mountains. She is the &quot;love interest.&quot;<br /><br />I love Hemingway's voice, and this novel continues to demonstrate his ability, with that spare, journalistic style, to narrate loneliness like no one else. The seemingly simplistic style evokes a real pathos, and is especially suited to writing of war and the human spiritual conflicts such situations impose upon its participants. The reader is explosed to the morality issues of war, how characters feel about killing, what is its necessity, when is it moral, when is it wrong, etc.<br /><br />The story becomes existential, very Kafkaesque, as well, when one character's interactions with command are relayed by Hemingway. I laughed allowed at the absudities, but was struck by the dire consequences of these ridiculous desicions and actions.

US	52928260	R1E9GICT476EO3	0915297019	740140710	Once a Runner: A Novel	Books	1	25	64	N	N	Disappointing	I did not like this book.<br /><br />The narrative, loosely structured, concerns itself with the ambitions of a college runner, Quenton Cassidy. He is approaching a four-flat minute mile, and is friends with an upper classman who has already won an Olympic medal in a longer-distance race. The book rambles about, focusing on the jocularity of the tracksters' dorm life, Cassidy's brief relationship with college woman Andrea, Cassidy's tricks on his fellow teammates, the idiocy of the coaches and university administration, Cassidy's memories of training, growing up, training, past races, training and university politics. The final section of the book deals with Cassidy preparing for a meet in which he will take on a world one-mile champion from New Zealand.<br /><br />The problems I had with the book stemmed first from the poor writing. Some of the plot points were too oblique (Henry James, anyone?), there were anachronisms for the 1970s in which the book was supposed to take place (Andrea has a computer class...), some of the language of the athletes was alternating crude then falsely cleaned up (one character says such crass things about women, I won't retype them here, then turns around and says \\"fanny\\"), and much of the description is pretty self-conscious, heavy-handed and reaching. For the most part the writing didn't support true characters.<br /><br />And these characters were poorly drawn. Cassidy and his close friends on the team are the only remotely sympathetic characters. Andrea is somewhat respectfully drawn, but the others are all very two-dimensional. The book is sexist in that it portrays both secretaries at the university who are mentioned by name as having or wanting to have sex with their bosses. The author also likes to tell the reader directly whom we should not like by naming them to indicate their character, \\"Hairlepp\\" and \\"Prigman.\\" The runners seem to look down on everyone, although Cassidy, patronizingly finds himself thinking \\"this is real life\\" whenever he is around very poor, hardworking people. It reminded me of Marie Antoinette playing in her village hamlet with her friends, enjoying the \\"real life\\" of the peasants.<br /><br />And I personally didn't like the main characters, particularly Cassidy. I just don't find these people likeable in their haughty jocularity, and Cassidy's wiser-than-thou translation of their behavior in expository scenarios for the reader.<br /><br />There is one nice chapter toward the end as Cassidy prepares for the big meet (after a completely unbelievable scenario in which he is thrown off the team and then entered into the meet as a Finnish runner). The day before the meet, he goes to the track and walks the quarters, thinking through each segment, what he will feel and think, what he needs to think and feel to win, etc. As a runner, I do understand all those mental calisthenics that must go into not quitting, doing better, trying harder, etc. (But then this lovely interlude was ruined by a gratuitous and needless flashback.) There is also a TEENY TINY TINY TEENY TEENY TEENY ITTY BITTY bit of suspense about the final race, which helped me finish the \\"last lap.\\"<br /><br />I was a little surprised this book could find a publisher.

Within pages of starting it, I was already back to regular journal writing myself. This volume includes entries from Monday, August 4, 1918, to Sunday, March 8, 1941, within four days of her suicide by drowning.<br /><br />The real value of this book, I think, which was heavily edited by her husband to protect people still living, I'm told, is that it clearly spells out the troubles and mental burdens of the writer that she was. I loved reading about her processes in writing books of hers that I have read, ORLANDO, TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, MRS. DALLOWAY. (I forgot the affection I held for Mrs. Dalloway until I read about her writing it, and I just felt love for that book all over again.)<br /><br />One can see the practical issues a writer faces, and I think this book performs the valuable service of illustrating that creative work is WORK, that it doesn't just rise from a magical well of talent and become complete -- voila! -- in the world. She frets about sales, about timing, about editing, about what her friends, Lytton Strachey, Morgan (E.M. Forster) and Tom (T.S. Eliot) will say. What the reviewers will understand of what she was trying to do, what her method should be, etc. It's a vivid account of the pain of creation. And she reminds herself each time a book comes out that she goes through these stages of happiness, dejection and waiting every time she publishes. When her book THREE GUINEAS came out, referring to the media response, she wrote from her home in the countryside, \\"It's true I have a sense of quiet and relief. But no wish to read reviews, or hear opinions... Mercifully we have 50 miles of felt between ourselves and the din.\\"<br /><br />She also notes how the slightest criticism is so much more resounding to her that the highest praise (we've all been there!), revealing explicitly that common trait of depressives, that their successes are somehow a sham perpetrated on the world by a cunning and knowing secret failure of a self.<br /><br />An interesting angle of this book is her experiences in World War II with the bombing of London by the Nazis. She and her husband, Leonard, lost two homes they had in London, and she sometimes wondered if she would die that day in a raid, even forcing herself to write how she imagined dying by bombing would feel. It made me think of de Beauvoir's autobiography, how it was most gripping when she wrote of her life in France during WWII and the Vichy government. I think, particularly in this area, Woolf's unexpergated diaries, which were published later, would prove even more vital and interesting.<br /><br />She also writes about what she is reading. Woolf was an accomplished critic, and she clearly like to write, to express herself in that way, whether for publication, or for catharsis as an \\"external processer\\" in her diaries, and her notes on what soothes her and what is boring for her (some chapters of ULYSSES) and what she ought to be reading if she's about to get killed in an air raid (SHAKESPEARE) are fascinating.<br /><br />This book is VERY episodic, and while it's a little harder to pick up again, because of the lack of a conventional plot of ongoing issues, it's easy to keep reading for pages and pages once one does pick it up again. There is no plot really apparent here about her mental illness. Her suicide isn't something the reader of this volume sees coming, though she is often ill with headaches and later on, influenza, and as the war continues, she is thinking about the concrete matters of death.<br /><br />Her lovely writing, colloquial, chatty, insightful and carefully plotting her worries and happinesses is a joy. Her last entry is about finding occupation to keep oneself going and motivated. She is even scheming what she could do with her time, and is grateful tohave supper to cook, now that the cook has left the household to be with her sister during the raids. It's very vibrant and lively. It's hard to believe she isn't out there somewhere still making her charming and insightful notes in her journals.<br /><br />This is a good book for people curious about the process of writing or about the thoughts of Woolf as she composed her books specifically. I would recommend it to them., now that the cook has left the household to be with her sister during the raids. It's very vibrant and lively.

And I do mean, divine. It's hard to find the words to praise Greene enough. His novels are so well executed, so elegantly written, so touching and so unexpectedly changing. They read easily, are very accessible. This book references DON QUIXOTE by Miguel de Cervantes, so I was doubly engaged here, as I had just read it. This book is about a priest, Father Quixote, who lives in El Toboso, Spain. Through a happenstance act of kindness to a man in power in the Catholic Church in Rome, Father Quixote is made a Monsignor, much to his bishop's dismay. His bishop has never liked Father Quixote. Due to his &quot;promotion&quot; Father Quixote has some time to take for himself, and leaves El Toboso with the town's former mayor, who has lost his re-election bid, whose last name is Panza, just like the famous Don Quixote's squire, Sancho, so Father Quixote calls his friend Sancho. Like the first and second sally in Cervantes, Monsignor Quixote and Sancho go forth in the world and have adventures. What I found wonderful about this book was the discussion between these two men about Communism and religion. They trade books and references, and argue principles lightly and engagingly. What is true about both men as Greene writes them is that they are loving people. Sancho is more cynical, but he is kind and is genuinely friends with Monsignor Quixote, and the monsignor, for his part, is truly loving, naive and true. The end of the book is a surprising and stunningly beautiful apotheosis of the ideas expressed within. This is one of my favorite works by Greene, and reminded me in some ways of the life-changing END OF THE AFFAIR. I highly recommend it.	2004-04-13

Hughes, born in Yorkshire, read English, Anthropology and Archeology at Cambridge, and met Plath, the ambitious American while she was on a Fulbright to Cambridge, after he had graduated. Their meeting was violent and dramatic (she bit him on the cheek when they kissed at a party he had brought another date to), and they quickly married. They had two children, and after she discovered his affair with another woman, they separated. During a harsh London winter, Plath killed herself by putting her head in an oven and leaving on the gas, and Hughes suffered the weight of that death for pretty much the rest of his life. That's the short story. The long version, as told in Feinstein's book is fair, multilayered, well and accessibly written, and includes informative critical comments of his work, and follows the path of his career. After Plath's death, Hughes maintained a relationship with the object of his affair, Assia Wevill, and other women. She had a daughter with him, and suffering her own depression, she killed herself AND their daughter within 10 years of Sylvia's death. Hughes was marked by some feminists as a horror of a husband, which was based on Sylvia's own viewpoint in her poems (poems that Hughes published, even though he was horrified at Sylvia's use of personal incidents for public poetry). Later, Hughes married a woman named Carol Orchard, and they were married for nearly 30  years. He also seems to have had numerous affairs in his life, and yet found Carol to be a stabilizing influence. Feinstein's work is important because she gives us a fuller picture of Britain's Poet Laureate Hughes (a work she began after his death in 1998 from cancer). Hughes, in an effort to protect his children with Plath, Freida and Nicholas, liked to maintain privacy about his life with Plath (and also, one suspects, because he just WAS private). When his book of poems about Plath was published in the years before his death, BIRTHDAY LETTERS, positive feeling was overwhelming for him, as people read the beautiful poems that spelled out his love, fear, hurt, empathy and his sense of powerlessness in the face of Plath's need in his relationship with her. This is a book you may read with other books around. I got out Plath's COLLECTED POEMS and Hughes's LUPERCAL and BIRTHDAY LETTERS to refer to. I recommend this biography to anyone. The dramatic events of his life make this compelling to those who have never read a word of his poems, and it stands as well, as fine example of the art of biography alone. Feinstein, who knew Hughes socially after the death of Plath, is sympathetic to him, but fair, I felt. As the quote on the book states, this is a book that needed to be written.

Coeztee is a different work of fiction. In fact, I've never read anything like it before. The book, about a novelist from Australia, is written in sections of talks that Elizabeth gives or attends. (Two of the sections were in the book THE LIVES OF ANIMALS, which reports two talks Costello gives at a mythical North American college.) The talks focus on different issues, all swirling somehow around the role of a writer and what a writer should fulfill for society. The final &quot;lesson&quot; seems to be about Costello making her case for her own afterlife, as she is asked to write her statement and testify before judges in an ambiguously drawn final scenario. Also, in an unprecedented move, Coetzee has Costello write a talk against an actual, living writer, and she ends up giving it to an audience that includes him. One must ask, &quot;Is Coetzee taking this man on? Is there something that has passed between them that the reader isn't privy to? Why wouldn't he fictionalize someone, rather than using a known, living author?&quot; The work is pretty philosophical, I found, and I would warn anyone who wanted to read Coetzee for the first time in the wake of his Nobel Prize win for literature in 2003 to choose something else to start with, perhaps DISGRACE or AGE OF IRON. The heroine is somewhat unlikeable, and, yet, one feels sympathetic to her attachments and concerns. This definitely &quot;feels like&quot; Coetzee, somewhat removed, deeply idea-driven, with a main character one somewhat fears, yet roots for. Overall the book is a serious work, worth time and the considerable effort I think it takes to understand, and yet it is not enjoyable per se.	2004-04-13

TALKING FROM 9 TO 5: WOMEN AND MEN AT WORK by Deborah Tannen is a book that everyone should read if he or she goes to work, anywhere. If you are a boss or have a boss, you should read this book (thank you Mom &amp; Dad). If you work with other people, you should read this book. Now that I have stressed that, I will tell you more about the book's focus and the points Tannen makes very well. She is well known for her book, YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND, which I have not read, but which is about how relationship problems come about due to differing communication styles between women and men (&quot;Report&quot; talk by men vs. &quot;rapport&quot; talk by women -- women talk &quot;troubles talk&quot; to build community, when men hear this, they are more than likely to feel that the problems need solving and will say what to do; this creates dissonance as the woman just wants to feel understood not &quot;bossed&quot; around, and the man can't understand why she's telling him problems if she doesn't want solutions). This book takes those issues to work and through many examples from her own research and others in sociolinguistics, anthropology and sociology, Tannen makes the point that different communication styles are problematic only when people don't understand them, that there is no &quot;better&quot; way to talk than another. Tannen made a fascinating point about communication styles and conversation rituals. She writes that people think they can tell when someone is lying to them, but research shows that really, people are not good at discerning this. In a similar way, we think we can tell if someone is confident and a good leader by the way they talk, but we can't. A woman, who raises the tone of her statements to sound like questions, who gives indirect orders and who seeks input before making decisions may often be assumed to be weaker than a man in a similar role, but her conversation rituals are not a true mark of who she is; they are the communication style that she was more likely than not socialized to use as a woman. Likewise, men are assumed to want the floor and command, when sometimes they would rather not take it. Tannen gives evidence on how difficult it is for women to be heard in meetings, and provides anthropological studies that show that as far back as age 3, boys listen to boys and girls listen to girls at play, but boys do not listen to girls, and may ignore and insult them when they pipe up to direct activities. This book is not a polemic against men or masculine styles. Tannen finds that most communication styles are appropriate in many instances. There is more than one way to get the job done, and sometimes, a masculine style is better than a feminine style, and sometimes the opposite is true, but she makes it very clear that a lack of that understanding can be detrimental to organizations because of erroneous assumptions made about people's abilities based on their conversational style. One of her overriding points, born out by her research, is that women tend to talk to build community and do nont like to stand out for accomplishments or for failures in a group. They will engage in ritual talk that seeks inclusion so as to maintain good feeling among the group, not because they are insecure and need to feel that no one dislikes them. Men, on the other hand, tend to engage in one-up talk, are more sensitive to being one down, and will take the lead to avoid being bested. (When a woman who is trying to build community is &quot;one-upped&quot; by a man who takes her ritualistic talk and her willingness to put herself down to create harmony, she feels &quot;betrayed&quot; by his spurning of her communal talk to take the upper hand. Who is &quot;right?&quot; Neither, but their reactions to the same conversation may be very different and in some cases, harmful to the organization.)  This book really changed the way I think about organizational life, the assumptions that I draw, the way I have communicated withpeople who worked for me, and what I will strive to do in the future. Even if you don't read the whole thing, buy it and keep it around. The last chapter, &quot;Who gets heard&quot; is especially instructive, and the afterword is a great essay on the issue with justification for her methods and theories. I think this book would be perfect for anyone who reports to someone of the opposite gender or who is the boss of same. But because the standards for styles are not entirely gender based, I would, again, suggest this book to EVERYONE.people who worked for me, and what I will strive to do in the future.

When I wanted to read about the Russian Revolution a history professor I knew said that this was the book. (Actually, Pipes has written a 976-page account called The Russian Revolution, but I went for the abridged version.)<br /><br />This 406-page, detailed, historical account of the revolution is definitely complete, and I learned a great deal that I did not know, of the state of the nation before the February Revolution in 1917, the revolutionaries, the Whites in the Civil War, the economic and geopolitical position of Russia in the world during World War I, and the methods and means of the Communist government and international Communist party in the early 1920s, and the horrible deaths that Lenin decreed were not warranted but were &quot;needed&quot; for the state to survive. Pipes' writing is clear, concise and chock full of facts. It's well organized, contains many photos of key players, as well as maps. The writing style is academic in terms of the ordering of thoughts, but completely accessible for interested parties. It really helped me sort and separate much of the information I had randomly received about this event and the shift in our world that resulted from it.<br /><br />I think this book was good, well written, well researched and deeply informative. I did find myself as I read it weighing what he wrote and asserted with his political affiliations. Pipes, who is the Baird Professor of History at Harvard University, served as President Reagan's National Security Council adviser on Soviet and East European affairs. As a neophyte to this body of knowledge, I don't know how much to except at face value assertions such as:<br /><br />* The October Revolution was not a revolution, as defined by a grassroots quest for governmental change, but rather a coup d'etat orchestrated by a small group representing a minority view. (Pipes feels so strongly about this, he puts the word &quot;revolution&quot; in quotes when writing of the October &quot;revolution.&quot;)<br />* Winston Churchill was one of the few Europeans or Americans who recognized that with the advent of the communist government in Russia, the world was undergoing a shift in orientation, from nation-state focus to an ideological focus split between communism and capitalism.<br />*The Whites, the revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow Lenin and the communist government, were not fighting for a return to tsarism, but rather for the return to the Provisional Government, which was democratic.<br /><br />While Pipes writes at length and fascinatingly about the inner workings of the party and government structure, the transformation from the revolution to the totalitarian regime of Lenin, he is deeply critical of the motives of the revolutionaries, and his kindest classification of them is that they are &quot;naive.&quot;<br /><br />One of the best features of this book is the eloquent closing chapter, &quot;Reflections on the Russian Revolution,&quot; which sums up Pipes's views of what happened. He also includes a helpful timeline and glossary.<br /><br />I learned a great deal from this book and feel I would like to read more from other perspectives. I do know of books by a London School of Economics professor, Robert Service, A Twentieth-Century History of Russia and Lenin: A Biography. I would like to get more of a grounding on the topic so that I can weigh the extensive and valuable viewpoints I got from Pipes.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book.* Winston Churchill was one of the few Europeans or Americans who recognized that with the advent of the communist government in Russia, the world was undergoing a shift in orientation, from nation-state focus to an ideological focus split between communism and capitalism.<BR>*The Whites, the revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow Lenin and the communist government, were not fighting for a return to tsarism, but rather for the return to the Provisional Government, which was democratic.<BR> <BR>While Pipes writes at length and fascinatingly about the inner workings of the party and government structure, the transformation from the revolution to the totalitarian regime of Lenin, he is deeply critical of the motives of the revolutionaries, and his kindest classification of them is that they are &quot;naive.&quot; <BR> <BR>One of the best features of this book is the eloquent closing chapter, &quot;Reflections on the Russian Revolution,&quot; which sums up Pipes's views of what happened.

US	52928260	R11TTZHDEQWT83	0679736417	61300054	Seven Gothic Tales	Books	4	25	32	N	N	Many layered tales	This is a demanding work of seven multilayered and esoteric stories in this, Dinesen's first book.<br /><br />We know of Dinesen more commonly by way of Meryl Streep, who played Dinesen, or the Baroness Karen Blixen, in &quot;Out of Africa.&quot; But the woman we find here as the author of these stories is no easily-understood, Hollywood character. Her stories within stories are rich in symbolism, imagination, and a &quot;long ago and far away&quot; feeling that is carefully, carefully, controlled by the author. Dinesen wrote some of these tales in Africa, and finished others along with ordering the book back home in Denmark, after her farm had failed. She wrote, interestingly, in English (and did her own translations back into Danish later on). Many books follow this one, including LAST TALES and, of course, OUT OF AFRICA. Dinesen, while the heroic, strong, individualist of Streep's portrayal, is also kind of strange, introspective, and fabulously bizarre. She uses her stories' plot lines as a means, one feels, to work out her life philosophies, reshape and recast ideas and symbolic imagery, and impart creative insights. After getting to about the fourth or fifth story, one can see that she uses the same imagery repeatedly and even the same turns of phrase.<br /><br />I have read this volume at least once before, and wanted to go through it again knowing just that much more literature and biblical references. (It helps to be well read in the classics when reading Dinesen.) Anything is up for her use, and if you don't see it, something will be lost to you as you interpret the stories and what they meant, or even, what happened. She loves Shakespeare (OUT OF AFRICA was written in five sections, after the five-act structure of Shakespearian drama), and Don Giovanni, she has interesting ideas about femininity and independent women, and symbolizes these issues with women who are doll-like, women who seem as if they can fly, women who are witches in some way or another, etc. She likes to toy with the mind of God, as well, having characters pronounce his proclivities, likes and dislikes, etc., quite often. I found these to be some of the most interesting passages, after some of the gender-defining ones, that is. (She chose her pseudonym, &quot;Isak,&quot; as it is Hebrew for &quot;He who laughs&quot; and she definitely plays with many ideas here, many humorously.)<br /><br />Of the seven tales (The Old Chevalier, The Roads Round Pisa, The Monkey, The Supper at Elsinore, The Dreamers, The Poet, and The Deluge at Norderney), The Roads Round Pisa is my favorite, and I have studied it for a graduate class. In the book, a mistake is the central event, and we learn of it only at the end. Our main character, Count Augustus Von Schimmelmann, is writing a letter to a friend, when a carriage accident occurs in front of him. An old woman, who seemed at first to him to be a man, is injured and asks that he go and seek out her granddaughter so that she may forgive her for an estrangement before she dies, as she believes she will do shortly. Augustus sets out for Pisa and in an inn meets a young man, with whom he engages in an interesting conversation. Soon, however, he finds out that this man is a woman, and whereas before he had been asking &quot;him&quot; for help in finding his way into the city, now he offers her his assistance as a gentleman. Their subsequent conversation holds a particularly compelling passage I have never forgotten. In it, Dinesen explicates a concept of women's differences, physically, psychologically and societally, from men through the artful use of the host and guest metaphor.<br />This passage is a key to the story's mood when toward the end the mistake around which the characters swirl is revealed. But the passage is also an interesting philosophical and societal analogy that provokes thought and discussion. This is, then, quintessential Dinesen.<br /><br />The other stories deal with identity and loss (The Dreamers), a ghost who is allowed to rise up from hell whenever the sound between Denmark and Sweden freezes over (Supper at Elsinore), the mirage of lost love (The Old Chevalier), poetry and power (The Poet), the societal roles of women (The Monkey), and identity (The Deluge at Norderney), but these are very brief and basic categorizations. One could safely say that all the stories deal with many of the others' main themes. The book as a whole is an excellent study of the power of fiction to suggest and manipulate, with beautiful, evocative writing and deep and stirring underlying meanings. I recommend it.ho is allowed to rise up from hell whenever the sound between Denmark and Sweden freezes over (Supper at Elsinore), the mirage of lost love (The Old Chevalier), poetry and power (The Poet), the societal roles of women (The Monkey), and identity (The Deluge at Norderney), but these are very brief and basic categorizations.

US	52928260	RWAZU33SW8HGL	0140298444	524924959	S.: A Novel about the Balkans	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A horrifying, necesssary read.	The book S: A NOVEL ABOUT THE BALKANS takes place in Bosnia in 1992 and 1993 during the war in which Serbian paramilitary instigators caused chaos in the nation, killing 250,000 Bosnian people and displacing around 2 million more. This novel focuses on the use of rape as a military tool to ethnically cleanse regions and to torture and dominate women in war.<br /><br />S is a substitute teacher in a small Bosnian village, who is originally from Sarajevo, and is more urbane and educated than her colleagues in the town. Her father is Muslim, her mother is Serbian. (I am sorry to use these titles, as &quot;Muslim&quot; is used often instead of &quot;Bosnian&quot; based on Serb propaganda that there were no Bosnians, only Serbs and people of the Islamic faith, remnants of the Ottoman empire in the Balkans). One morning, before work, buses roll into the town, all the women are told to pack a few things and get on them with their small children, the men are rounded up, taken out of sight and shot. S.'s family in Sarajevo has already disappeared; she does not know where they are. She takes with her some jewelry, a nice dress and fancy Italian shoes and a family photo album.<br /><br />The women get on the buses and are taken to a prison camp. While staying in the camp, some of the women are selected for occupation in the &quot;Women's Room.&quot; These are quarters to which the Serbian soldiers go to get women to rape as they please. S. is chosen to live there, and must endure the pain, humiliation and dehumanization of that existence, until the camp commander chooses her as a weekend &quot;companion&quot; for himself. Because she is the captain's special choice, the other soliders leave her alone.<br /><br />After some time, the camp occupants are told they will be exchanged, and they travel by bus to the Croatian border. Within Croatia, which has already successfully separated from Yugoslavia, the refugees live in another camp. S. has a cousin in Zagreb, but she does not accept her offer to live with her, seeing that she has not much to give, either. She chooses instead to emigrate to Sweden (it is the most different place she can think of to go from where she has been), and there she gives birth to her child, whom she conceived in the Women's Room at the camp.<br /><br />Drakulic, a Croatian journalist (sorry, I cannot make the diacritical mark above the c that Serbo-Croatian uses; I believe it is pronounced, &quot;DRAH-koo-leech&quot;), began this project by speaking to women who had suffered in the war, had been routinely raped by soldiers, some of whom had born children as a result of those attacks. The Penguin version that I read contains a readers' guide in the back in which a conversation with Drakulic is included, along with discussion questions and a short introduction.<br /><br />She spoke with women who were very willing to tell her the details of what happened to them, but not their emotional responses, as that was too horrifying for them to recount, so she turned the project into fiction, so that she could write the response of the victims to this dehumanizing torture tactic. All of the characters are known by their initials only, in an effort to universalize their existences, to disallow the reader to feel that this could not happen to them, that it happened far, far away. As a woman with a name that starts with S. I was distinctly drawn in to her identity. S's story focuses on how the war alienates the victims from the rest of socieyt, but rape distinctly isolates the women victims from anyone's understanding.<br /><br />S. focuses a lot on the mental state that allows people to be immediately subjugated by another's will. She cannot accept how all of them, herself included (who offered coffee to the soldier that came into her apartment and told her to pack), immediately obeyed the invaders, left their entire lives and identities behind and followed without fighting. She is struck by how quickly they willingly lie down on the floor of the former machine shed at the camp and defecate in a field in full view of the captors.<br /><br />The book is violent at times, but the horror of it is somewhat removed, very realistically told by someone who cannot quite bear it and who would never sensationalize the obviously vile by over elaborating on it. There are particularly egregious acts retold through the prisoners' eyes (the burning of male prisoners' corpses, a particularly vicious rape in the Women's Room of a girl by a boy she grew up with), but overall the book focuses on the pyschological state of a victim of the war's cruel machinery.<br /><br />Though it is fiction, I think in some ways, it is more powerful than a factual article would be. We know these things, abstractly; we understand that they happened. To read a novelization, an amalgam of the sufferings of thousands of women, who become personal to one, makes the truth burst inside the reader's psyche with the force that a thousand newspaper articles cannot convey. A descriptor on the back lists the book as &quot;grim and horrific&quot; and says the book &quot;puts a human face on harrowing headlines.&quot; Indeed it does.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone. It's well written, and fulfills a role well that fiction is meant to play, illuminating another's reality so that it becomes one's own.the former machine shed at the camp and defecate in a field in full view of the captors. <BR> <BR>The book is violent at times, but the horror of it is somewhat removed, very realistically told by someone who cannot quite bear it and who would never sensationalize the obviously vile by over elaborating on it.

US	52928260	RZCN5V44T5UPW	0060085894	483913583	Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo	Books	4	27	27	N	N	A thorough rendering of an artist's life	This biography is a complete, engaging 440-page effort of sheer reportage. Herrera, an art historian and curator, has also written a book on Kahlo's art, and books on Mary Frank and Matisse, and you can see evidence of her thoroughness on every page. The book traces Kahlo's life by setting up the lives of her parents (her father was an Austrian immigrant to Mexico) all the way to her death and funeral with great detail. As Herrera follows the path of Kahlo's life, she includes letters to and from Kahlo, Kahlo's journal excerpts (illustrations, words and poems) and explicates Kahlo's art as it becomes relevant to the storyline of her life, either because paintings were done around the time of narrative points or because they illustrate incidents or themes in Kahlo's life. There are two color-plate sections and two black-and-white photo/painting sections to which the reader may refer.<br /><br />Frida's life is certainly compelling, and Herrera doesn't need to resort to emotional language or hyperbole to make her interesting -- and, thankfully, she doesn't. The narrative is quite matter-of-fact, and illustrated with the subjects' own words, one feels that one can get to know Frida, and her husband, Diego Rivera, pretty well, for being somewhat removed from them (at least I feel that way living in the twenty-first century in Arkansas). The book incorporates the commonly known facts of Frida's life -- her devastating tram accident as a high-schooler in which she was impaled on a shaft of metal handrail, her turbulent and deep connection with and TWO subsequent marriages to Diego Rivera, her Mexicanista loyalties and sensibilities, her affair with Trotsky, her personal flamboyance and her great talent -- with the over-arching idea of Frida's alegr&iacute;a -- or happiness, joy -- in the face of her many hardships. As one of her friends said, Frida was a woman who &quot;lived dying.&quot; Her many health problems and her problematic and sometimes painful relationship with Rivera were great obstacles to her, but her flamboyant alegr&iacute;a appears throughout her life as a constant, a will to enjoy, to overcome.<br /><br />I think what the book offers most is Frida's personality, explicated as carefully and well as the paintings, and the effort helps inform the viewer's assessment and response to her work. Using Kahlo's own words often, Herrera allows Frida to tell us herself her reactions to incidents, events, her successes, her health problems.<br /><br />She writes to her dear friend and medical adviser, Dr. Eloesser, in the United States when she is struggling with the decision to amputate her increasingly problematic foot: &quot;My dearest Doctorcito: [The doctors] are driving me crazy and making me desperate. What should I do? It is as if I am being turned into an idiot and I am very tired of this f---ing foot and I would like to be painting and not worrying about so many problems. But, it can't be helped, I have to be miserable until the situation is resolved...&quot;<br /><br />This passage is emblematic of Kahlo, mixing her crass language with her charming endearments to her friends, her concern for her health and her resignation to the situation, &quot;it can't be helped...&quot; She often curses, refers to her reader as &quot;kid&quot; and to money as &quot;dough,&quot; in English.<br /><br />Herrera points out points at which Kahlo is not completely forthcoming with truthful details, for instance her age, the length of time she spent hospitalized at various stages, and her changing view on whether she was a Surrealist painter or not. She also illustrates Kahlo's changes in terms of the political situation of the international Communist party, her views about Trotsky, and her public vs. private comments on Diego's never-ending philandering.<br /><br />In a book on Kahlo, these life details are relevant to her art because her art is confessional and personal. She's a &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; of painting and mines her lifeand emotions for subjects until the end. Not long before she died, she had resolved her priorities, telling a friend, &quot;I only want three things in life: to live with Diego, to continue painting, and to belong to the Communist party.&quot;<br /><br />The people around her were deeply important to Frida Kahlo, and to the end of her life, she adored her friends, wrote winning and charming, caring notes to them, and wanted them around her at the end. Her love of others plays itself out in her political beliefs; she toured the world as an artist, but she drew her subjects and methods from Mexicanista traditions, and popular as well as pre-Columbian culture. Her personal illustrations are appealing because of that understanding of others, and Herrera's sound biography renders Kahlo's work and life even more poignant and remarkable. It's a good book. I recommend it.<br />(I do wish that this book had Frida Kahlo's own art or a photo of her on the cover, rather than a photo of Salma Hayek as Frida Kahlo.)til the end.

US	52928260	REO2O9WISRB6I	0060188707	655554658	Don Quixote	Books	3	10	20	N	N	A lot to get through, but a lovely point	The character of Don Quixote has decided that he will become a knight errant, leaving his life behind and sallying forth to advance the values of chivalry in the world. He takes the working-class (sorry for the anachronism) Sancho Panza with him as his squire. Much to the chagrin of those close to him, Don Quixote believes that he is indeed a knight, and the reality of the world falls victim to his perceptions of it as a place in which knights are assailed by magical forces and spells, in which the Helmet of Mambrino comes along for the taking and in which windmills are the enemy.<br /><br />Don Quixote serves the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, and performs his brave exploits in her honor. He has however never seen her (and she seems that she does not indeed exist), and some funny incidents happen when interactions are sought with her. Also, Don Quixote has promised Sancho an island to rule as governor, and Sancho pursues all avenues to achieve this end. In the second book of the novel, Sancho gets a chance to rule, and he shows interesting capabilities and savviness in the discharge of his duties.<br /><br />The book is episodic, as Don Quixote and Sancho encounter various adventures and challenges. The reader has a humorous view of the two adventurers, able to see the reality in relief to their vision of the world. While Sancho seems not to have suffered a &quot;psychic break&quot; with the world, he is humorously flexible in his views; when it serves him, he accepts Don Quixote's explanations of reality, when it behooves him to see the world as it is, he does so, but modifies his retelling of his events for his master to maintain Don Quixote's illusion.<br /><br />What comes first and foremost to mind is the line in the movie Quiz Show spoken by Charles Van Doren's father, a literature professor at Columbia University, as his students leave the lecture hall. Some of them cannot suspend their disbelief that a man could make his knightly fantasy last so long and be so believable (to himself), and Prof. Van Doren says he is able to be a knight because &quot;he believes he is one&quot; (or something to that effect). Strangely, it was this inadvertant lecture on Don Quixote that has made it most appealing to me, that explains the motivation and charm and compelling aspect of Don Quixote; he is chivalrous because he believes he is, he continues to honor those values because he believes they can be honored, and he believes that the world embraces his services because chivalry is alive, is needed, and its priests are welcomed.<br /><br />Don Quixote's state of mind and construction of reality are humorous to be sure, but his beliefs in overarching values are appealing and made me think of what could be real because we make it so, what could be real for the better? As the novel progresses, Cervantes gives more credence to Don Quixote's value system, and less to those who are sane around him. It's an interesting read, and certainly a foundational work.believable (to himself), and Prof. Van Doren says he is able to be a knight because &quot;he believes he is one&quot; (or something to that effect).

I expected it to be a persuasive polemic on animal rights, and what I found was that it was a brilliant complilation of writings on a theme that raises many issues and questions on the relationships between humans and other animals with great respect for many viewpoints.<br /><br />Coetzee (1940-), who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003, is a critic and writer who was born in Cape Town, South Africa. His novels include: Dusklands, In the Heart of the Country, Waiting for the Barbarians, Life and Times of Michael K, Foe, Age of Iron, The Master of Petersburg and Elizabeth Costello. He's won the Booker Prize twice (the first author to do so). He also has written two volumes of autobiography. He has a Ph.D. in literature from the University of Texas at Austin,and also spent time, between his master's and doctorate, as a computer programmer. He's spent several stints in the United States as a visiting scholar.<br />I share this level of background on Coetzee because I think in this case, it is warranted. THE LIVES OF ANIMALS is a volume comprising many kinds of writing, fiction, argument, scholarly responses and, even I think, memoir in context. And it asks and doesn't answer the question of what Coetzee, personally, thinks of the ideas raised within.<br /><br />The main text of THE LIVES OF ANIMALS comes from the 1997-1998 Tanner Lectures at Princeton University. Atypical of the usual philosophical essays given in the series, Coetzee read two short stories on the way humans treat and view and philosophize on animals, and within these stories, are lectures and question-and-answer series on animal issues. The main character, Elizabeth Costello (an apparent pre-apparition of  the so-named Elizabeth Costello of his most recent novel), has been invited to lecture at Appleton College in America. A writer, she has been invited to speak on whatever she likes, and she chooses humanity's treatment of animals to talk about at several events. Her son, John, is a physics and astronomy professor there, and is hosting her -- he calls her interest in animal rights her \\"hobbyhorse.\\" The son's wife, a philosophy professor who can't seem to get a tenure-track position in the same city as her husband, and his mother do not get along, and Costello's \\"radicalism\\" on animal rights confounds the son and irritates his wife to no end.<br /><br />Coetzee's lecture was broken up into two sections, \\"The Philosophers and the Animals\\" and \\"The Poets and the Animals.\\" In each, Costello deals with human treatment of animals in that context, among others. In the first, she gives a philosophical essy on animal treatment at the college, and in the second, she addresses a literature class using poets' treatment of animals as inspiration for her talk. Her last event is a debate.<br /><br />During her lecture, Costello, who deeply and emotionally values the lives of animals, makes a connection between the Holocaust and the mechanized system of animal slaughter for food and byproducts in the developing world. This likening offends a literature professor, Dr. Stern, who declines to dine with Costello and her son along with other college elites that night at a special dinner. The next day, she receives a letter from him, including the lines, \\"You took for your own purposes the familiar comparison between the murdered Jews of Europe and slaughtered cattle. The Jews died like cattle, therefore cattle die like Jews, you say. That is a trick with words which I will not accept. ... Man is made in the likeness of God, but God does not have the likeness of man. If Jews were treated like cattle, it does not follow that cattle are treated like Jews...\\"<br /><br />This is one example of an exchange within the main story of the book, and the rest follows this style, in which Costello raises issues, and an opposing point, in various settings, is raised in various demeanors and humors. Often, they are not settled, and the narrative gives no hint as to a right or moral authority on the issue. At the lecture, at the dinner, in the classroom, at the debate and in pillow talk at John's home with his philosopher wife. The point and counter point is woven within a compelling character sketch.<br /><br />What follows in the book are essays in response to Coetzee's lectures by Wendy Doniger, the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago; Marjorie Garber, William R. Kenan, Jr., professor of English at Harvard University and Director of Harvard's Center for Literary and Cultural Studies; Amy Gutmann (who wrote the introduction), Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor at Princeton University, founding director of the University Center for Human Values; Peter Singer, professor in the Centre for Human Bioethics at Monash University; and Barbara Smuts, professor of psychology and anthropology at the University of Michigan. Each essay focuses on various aspects of Coetzee's characters' statements and viewpoints, drawing them out and parsing them, elaborating on the cultural background, and providing more point and counter point for consideration. One particularly charming piece is written as a fictional account of a poor professor asked to write a response to a lecture that was actually a short story... what is he to do?<br /><br />I found the final piece by Smuts almost as compelling as the Coetzee fiction she was responding to. Smuts has spent countless hours observing wild primates, and she writes movingly of her interaction with baboons in the wild and Diane Fossey's gorilla groups. She writes also of her close relationship with her dog, Safi, who understands complete sentences and cooperates with Smuts out of mutual respect, not because Smuts controls her, Smuts asserts. She makes one of the most thoughtful observations in the book, that personal relationships are had with animals. \\"In the language I am developing here,\\" she writes, \\"relating to other beings as persons has nothing to do with whether or not we attribute human characteristics to them. It has to do, instead, with recongizing that they are social subjects, like us, whose idiosyncratic, subjective experience of us plays the same role in their relations with us that our subjective experience of them plays in our relationships with them. If they relate to us as individuals, and we relate to them as individuals, it is possible for us to have a personal relationship.\\"<br /><br />The book, taken as a whole, invites strong consideration of how we use, view and relate to animals. Costello, who refuses to eat meat, admits that she wears leather shoes, stating it's \\"degrees of obscenity.\\" Another writer asks if an unanticipated death after a happy life is cruel to the animal. And if it isn't, perhaps it is still bad -- bad for the killers even if not bad for the killed. Taken as a whole, the book reads as if the issue is still a question for Coetzee and the other writers, who continue to ask after the moral and ecological role of humanity as a whole. If not a question, the book is, certainly then, respectful, and for that reason alone should be read by anyone who wants to make a considered decision on the issue, whatever his or her final decision may be.hey are not settled, and the narrative gives no hint as to a right or moral authority on the issue.

US	52928260	R2KL1OHY5O1TCX	0525947647	857217799	Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A needed voice in public discourse	This book gained a lot of publicity when it was the subject of a law suit. Interestingly, the law suit brought by Fox News against this book, for violating trademark by using the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" in the title, was judged \\"wholly without merit\\" by a judge. Al Franken said, in response, that Fox News should change its slogan to reflect that ruling: \\"Fox News: Wholly without merit.\\"<br /><br />Franken's book makes a case for such a judgement. His convincingly researched volume is the product of his service as a fellow at Harvard's Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy. In this capacity, he led Harvard students, \\"TeamFranken\\" in researching deliberate and ignorant mistruths promulgated by conservatives in the United States political process.<br /><br />Obviously, Franken has a decided political position, and one has to take his assessment of the \\"truth\\" with a grain of salt, as one should of anything firmly planted inside an ideology. There were times, specifically the \\"Operation Chickenhawk: Episode 1\\" chapter, that I felt that Franken was perpetrating the wrongs that he has accused the \\"other side\\" of committing, and I didn't enjoy it. But for the most part, I laughed, was outraged and felt confident with his research.<br /><br />Franken starts out and continues throughout the book addressing the idea that mainstream media leans to the left of the political spectrum. He notes instances in which general source media (network television and newspapers, like the New York Times) picked up what he believes to be right-wing reaction or language and promulgated it as accepted news. Two of these sitatutions were the Al Gore Exaggeration Story and the It Was Not a Memorial Service (for Paul Wellstone).<br />TeamFranken explicates the history of the universally accepted truth that Al Gore lies and exaggerates his own accomplishments. For example, Gore said, \\"During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet,\\" referring to his efforts in Congress to help fund the Internet's forerunner, a military computer network called Arpanet. \\"What he seemed to be doing is what members of Congress do: He was taking credit for a program he championed and funded. In this case, one that revolutionized the information infrastructure of the entire world,\\" writes Franken. Al Gore was also falsely accused of claiming that he and Tipper were the inspiration for the characters in LOVE STORY, Oliver Barrett and Jenny Cavalleri. What actually happened was that a newspaper in Tennessee had misquoted the author of LOVE STORY, Erich Segal, as saying the above story (Segal had actually stated that Oliver Barrett was based partially on Al Gore and partly on Tommy Lee Jones, his college roommate, but not that Tipper had a part in it.) Gore, having read the article in his home state paper, told another reporter that that was what he had read, not that he was the inspiration. Another instance included the New York Times and the Washington Post misquoting Gore saying that he had been the one who started it all, in terms of the investigation of Love Canal, when what he had said was \\"That was the one that started it all,\\" referring to a toxic waste dump in Tennessee that a little girl had written to his Congressional office about. Though the NYTimes and the Post issued corrections, the story took hold and furthered the idea of Gore as a congenital exaggerator (if I may be inspired by Safire here).<br /><br />The issue of the Wellstone Memorial is similar. Franken, who attended the service, said that Wellstone's friend, in his speech, went over the top and was inappropriate in calling for everyone -- including Republicans present at the event -- to vote for Mondale, but that previous to that many heartfelt speeches were made, one for each casualty of the plane crash that killed Wellstone, his wife, other family members and staffers. But by the time the story had moved through the \\"filtering\\" of theright wing, it grew maintstream media legs for the accusation that the mourners were \\"plants\\" \\"shuttled in,\\" that Trent Lott was booed off the stage (he never spoke, and smiled good naturedly at some teasing boos from a small contingent of people in the stands when he entered, sayeth Franken), and that they whole thing was conceived and planned as a political move against Wellstone's opponent, Coleman (who won).<br /><br />I won't list all the examples in the book, but wanted to present an idea of what is written in the volume and how Franken addresses what he decries as lowering the tone of discourse in politics in America, for which he holds entities like Fox News and people like Ann Coulter responsible. He seeks to shoot down right-wing propaganda and parses data released by the White House in furtherance of its policies, with which he disagrees, to show vastly different results.<br /><br />The writing is funny, and I laughed out loud often while reading LIES. Some chapter titles include: Who Created the Tone?, Did the Tone Change? Why Did Anyone Think it Would Change? and I Grow Discouraged about the Tone. He includes information about tax cuts and cuts to state funding in a witty play, and even includes a funny cartoon, \\"Supply Side Jesus,\\" for which he gives credit for the idea to Bradley Whitford (yes, that Bradley Whitford, from WEST WING). He does a hysterical typographical number on Colmes's name whenever he mentions the Fox News show Hannity and Colmes, in which Colmes is supposed to represent the Left -- it made me laugh every single time I saw it.<br /><br />Franken saves his deepest vitriol for George Bush, Dick Cheney, Ann Coulter and Karl Rove, not only showing another side to their presentation of policy and events, but also refuting the effectiveness of the administration's policies in humorous and convincing prose.<br /><br />Franken succeeds here at making political and policy knowledge and issues entertaining, in a substantive way. He is deeply offended by what he feels is a degrading effect on political discourse in this country by some of the right-wing's most powerful people and its pundits to win at any cost. This book is a vital part of the public discourse on politics and the state of the nation, whether one agrees or not, because it presents another side to accepted truths about our country.it grew maintstream media legs for the accusation that the mourners were \\"plants\\" \\"shuttled in,\\" that Trent Lott was booed off the stage (he never spoke, and smiled good naturedly at some teasing boos from a small contingent of people in the stands when he entered, sayeth Franken), and that they whole thing was conceived and planned as a political move against Wellstone's opponent, Coleman (who won). <BR> <BR>I won't list all the examples in the book, but wanted to present an idea of what is written in the volume and how Franken addresses what he decries as lowering the tone of discourse in politics in America, for which he holds entities like Fox News and people like Ann Coulter responsible.

US	52928260	R1IGYPGU58KUZR	0140280553	654799136	Galileo's Daughter: A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A complete memoir	I thought this would be historical fiction, a novel, and when its turn came to read, and I picked it up to figure out what it was, I got really excited about what I was about to learn. Inside the front cover, it reads, &quot;Inspired by a long fascination with Galileo, and by the remarkable surviving letters of Galileo's daughter, a cloistered nun, Dava Sobel has written a biography unlike any other of the man Albert Einstein called &quot;the father of modern physics -- indeed of modern science altogher.&quot; I noted the diagrams and illustrations of the people, Galileo's equations and inventions.<br /><br />But what I didn't anticipate was the kind of learning I would be exposed to and how moving the book would be. It turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read, incorporating so many facets in a well-written memoir that challenged and fulfilled.<br /><br />Of course, I learned quite a bit about the advance of understanding of science and the universe from the story of Galileo's life. His father wanted him to be a physician, but he preferred mathematics and matriculated at the University in Pisa. From there, he took various positions in Italy, eventually ending up as court philosopher and mathematician for the Medici family in Florence. Under their patronage, he was able to maintain the income of a professorship in another city without having to show up to teach. He invented tools to supplement his income, and had three children with a woman he didn't marry, two daughters and a son. The daughters he placed in a convent in Florence, thinking they would be unlikely to marry due to their illegitimacy (apparently, scholars often remained unmarried), and the son he eventually legitimized through a church action. Sobel writes of the progression of Galileo's understanding of the universe after procuring a telescope and modifying it to improve his vision of the sky. He also concentrated heavily on the laws of motion.<br /><br />Galileo was deeply religious and deeply devoted to the Catholic Church; he was also &quot;connected&quot; through his work as court philosopher for the Medicis in Florence. Though the pope who preceded Urban VIII was not a friend to Galileo and resisted Galileo's advancement of Copernicus's theory of the sun as the center of the universe, rather than the earth, Urban VIII knew Galileo, and the mathematician was able to have an audience with him soon after he ascended to the office. (Though this relationship would have to submit in the end to Urban's declining political position and would not save Galileo from the inquisitors.)<br /><br />What emerges here is the incredible control over the minds of its subjects the Catholic church enjoyed/enforced in Italy in the 1500s and 1600s. While those Catholics outside Italy were more likely to dispense with papal orders, those within Italy lived in a society structured to control them rigorously. Loyal Galileo, while writing his Dialogue that sought to educate readers on the various theories of the movement of the universe, submitted his work to official inquisitors, the pope's advisers, etc., and willingly changed what they instructed him to out of deference to the church.<br /><br />The daughter of this book's title is Virginia, whose name became Maria Celeste when she took her vows as a Poor Clare in her convent near Florence. Her younger sister also took vows at the convent, but was not close to her father, and was an unwilling, whining, hypochondriacal nun. In this book, Suor Maria Celeste's 100-plus letters to her father are translated and published for the first time in English, inserted into the narrative in response to events Sobel is reporting in Galileo's life. The letters are sweet and respectful, and show Maria Celeste's dependence on her father for resources as well as her willingness to do for him. She mixed him remedies in the convent's pharmacy, cooked sweets for him and rewrote his manuscripts for him as asked. The two could only visit through a grill at the convent, as Maria Celeste could never leave the grounds, but her letters (his to her did not survive) show a doting, close and mutually rewarding relationship between Galileo and his older daughter.<br /><br />The book brings to life the daily routines and realities of early 17th century life in Italy, as Sobel makes real what life would be like without clocks, long difficult journeys, onlsaughts of the plague and political intrigues at the Vatican and the local inquisitors'. These tangential explanations, along with the recounting of Galileo's trial in Rome for his DIALOGUE, and his personal and religious sadness over being listed on the church's Index of Prohibited Books, and his daughter's responses and caretaking love of her father, make Galileo a real man, rather than an ancient archetype or a note on a timeline. We see what his questioning intellect cost him and the pleasure and sustenance he derived from his close relationship with his loving and faithful daughter.<br /><br />The final pages of the book contain such a moving and tender apotheosis of the relationship between Galileo and Suor Maria Celeste. While the book was fabulous, the ending was fulfilling in a wholly unexpected way. I'm grateful for this book, for all I learned from it, and for all I came to understand.the convent, as Maria Celeste could never leave the grounds, but her letters (his to her did not survive) show a doting, close and mutually rewarding relationship between Galileo and his older daughter.<BR> <BR>The book brings to life the daily routines and realities of early 17th century life in Italy, as Sobel makes real what life would be like without clocks, long difficult journeys, onlsaughts of the plague and political intrigues at the Vatican and the local inquisitors'.

US	52928260	R20L26BDEILFM5	0786867175	590874516	Leap of Faith: Memoirs of an Unexpected Life	Books	4	6	9	N	N	A moving, thorough memoir	I was really moved by this memoir, mostly by the idea expressed in the title, &quot;an unexpected life.&quot; An upperclass Arab-American girl finds herself a queen and in a position to work for the values she's long held in a real and substantive way with a loving, energetic partner.<br />Queen Noor was born in the United States as Lisa Halaby to an Arab-American father and a mother of European descent. Her father was a member of a prominent family (his father had had a long-time luxury business collaboration with Neiman Marcus). Najeeb Halaby had worked with airline companies and was appointed head of the FAA by President Kennedy. Though he adored public service, Najeeb had difficulty sustaining his family's lifestyle on a public servant's salary. The family moved a lot, living in Washington and New York, among other places. Ultimately, Noor's parents split up, but not while she and her siblings were small. Noor was one of the inaugural members of Princeton's first class that admitted women students, where she studied architecture and urban planning.<br /><br />During college, Noor's political activitism emerged in force, where she expressed distress at the Viet Nam war and the Kent State violence. After college, she went to Iran to work on a large urban planning project in Tehran for the Shah. While there, she saw the growing discontent with the ruling class by the religious groups in the country, but left before the Shah was overthrown.<br /><br />Through her father, who was advising Jordan on airline issues, then-Lisa Halaby met King Hussein, whose third wife, Alia, had just died in a helicopter crash. Their courtship was swift and Hussein's story was very compelling, which she recounts to the reader as she learned it while spending time with him in Amman and Aqaba. Hussein is a direct descendent of Mohammad and was present when his grandfather, King Abdullah, was shot and killed in front of him. (Hussein was also shot, but was saved when the bullet was deflected by a medal he was wearing on his military uniform at his grandfather's insistence.) Hussein's father didn't reign long due to mental illness. Hussein had been married and divorced from his first two wives, an Arab woman and a British woman (who is the mother of the current King Abdullah) and lost his third wife. He was married to Noor for more than 20 years.<br /><br />The facts of their lives are compelling, but it's the emotional detail that really rivets the reader. Noor fell in love with Hussein and had four children with him, she converted to Islam and became deeply religious in the tradition of her husband's country (she wasn't legally required to convert; the king was allowed to marry anyone of a monotheistic faith), and got involved in civil and economic and political efforts to better not only the lives of those in Jordan but also in the Arab world. She makes an articulate and impassioned case for understanding the Arab viewpoint and what the history of Imperialism in the region has done for Arabs in the world today. While hopeful that peace can be found with Israel, she lists Israel's moral and political sins, and makes her case convincingly.<br /><br />This is also a fascinating look at King Hussein, his history, personality and goals. Constantly under threat of assassination and seemingly endlessly routed from his plans for peace, Hussein was almost always optimistic in his hopes for the region.<br /><br />But more than anything, this is a very moving story of a marriage, and seems to me the story that any happily married woman could write. Noor, who was renamed by her husband when she was married and converted Noor Al Hussein, which means &quot;Light of Hussein,&quot; obviously loves and admires her husband, took his goals as her own and found her individual ways of advancing them through rural development and microloan projects, urban planning issues and her architectural expertise. She also calls on her American heritage to boost relationships. Shebelieves in these issues as an Arab woman herself and as a Muslim, but the reader can see how much she and her husband loved each other.<br /><br />His death from cancer in the end of the book is truly sad as one can see what she -- and the world -- have lost. She writes of his death, &quot;From that moment on, I knew I would never fear death but see it as a chance for reunion.&quot; Their deep and fulfilling relationship is the real engine behind the movement and engagement of this book. I highly recommend it.these issues as an Arab woman herself and as a Muslim, but the reader can see how much she and her husband loved each other.<BR> <BR>His death from cancer in the end of the book is truly sad as one can see what she -- and the world -- have lost.

US	52928260	R2EDYUAZM103LL	0375700528	400024285	The Lover	Books	4	41	43	N	N	Memories elucidated	THE LOVER by Marguerite Duras, which was an international best seller and winner of the Prix Goncourt in France, tells the story of a young French girl growing up in Indochina in the 1930s and her affair with the son of a Chinese millionaire. She does not love him and his father refuses to allow them to stay together because she is white, but, to me, the love story, while serving as the reason for the story, is not the central focus. More riveting, I found was the emotional violence of the narrator's family life and the style in which it is written.<br /><br />The book is written expertly and experimentally in a way that moves like a recollecting mind among ideas, images and themes. At first this is disorienting to the reader, but it begins to feel very natural very quickly, because I think the style effectively mimics the way the mind flows back over our past. Duras wrote the reputedly semi-autobiographical book over four months in 1984 when she was nearly seventy years old.<br /><br />The passages on the life of her family are tragic and, as I said, emotionally very violent. The nameless French narrator grows up with a poor mother who is a school mistress in Indochina and her two brothers. The elder brother seems to be incredibly self involved and coddled by their mother, but the younger siblings are afraid of him. Duras recounts his actions with a distance that makes his behaviors more frightening, and he emerges as a central force of the book.<br /><br />The small book, a little over 100 pages, is hard to forget. It so well mimics the process of the mind, it begins to feel as if it is one's own memories, mined from all the connections thoughts seek to make when we look back to a time long past that won't let us go.	2004-01-11

Belli does not suffer either, but rather finds a balance in her narration between the concerns of her worldly life with the concerns of her personal life. She recounts in similar voice the dramas of her involvement with the Sandinistas and her rise in the eventual government the rebel group achieved and the complications of her personal life as her first marriage and then her second crumbled.<br /><br />She writes about herself as a Do&ntilde;a Quixote, seeking to make the world a better place, and having her own adventures, and the titles of each chapter charmingly advance this thematic idea, having a similar style to Cervantes' work (which I am reading now). For example, chapter 22 is titled, &quot;On the hectic preparations for the attacks and on how I was unexpectedly called to perform a dangerous mission.&quot; Belli gives a compelling account in these chapters of the egregious human rights violations of the Somoza dictatorship that the Sandinistas sought to overthrow. The reader is walked through her early life, the daily life of a privileged Nicaraguan who felt a moral imperative to make a change in the government of her country. She also recounts her feelings about the Reagan administration's support of the Contras who sought to overthrow the Sandinista government. The actions of the United States, according to Belli in COUNTRY, were illustrative of why the United States is not universally beloved. This empire had a personal and profound impact on the author, who now lives in the United States part of the time with her third husband.<br /><br />Belli is an accomplished poet and writer, and it shows in her work. She draws the picture of her life clearly and vividly, not falling prey to the &quot;telling not showing&quot; disease many nonwriters have when they seek to illustrate their own lives.<br /><br />Belli writes with heartbreak of how the Sandinistas lost the election soon after they effected the end of the Somoza regime, but it is touching and shows the lasting legacy of the Sandinista revolution: It gave Nicaraguans the right to vote for their own leaders.ot showing&quot; disease many nonwriters have when they seek to illustrate their own lives. <BR> <BR>Belli writes with heartbreak of how the Sandinistas lost the election soon after they effected the end of the Somoza regime, but it is touching and shows the lasting legacy of the Sandinista revolution: It gave Nicaraguans the right to vote for their own leaders.	2004-01-05

It's a singular work that facilitates new understanding and insight, and makes the point effectively that the drama-rama of the human mind can supercede or at least equal the drama of the world around us.<br />The Ramsay family is the center of the story, and it is at their home in the Hebrides that the first section takes place, &quot;The Window.&quot; In fact, this section, which covers only part of a day in time, comprises 125 pages of the 209-page book. In a way similar to that of MRS. DALLOWAY, Woolf switches the perspective among the Ramsay family and some of their guests, Lily, an indepedent single woman, the Ramsay children, and Charles Tansley, a student of Mr. Ramsay, a philosopher.<br />There are threads of the issue of femininity in the book. What do the differing ways in which Mrs. Ramsay, mother of eight and supportive wife, and Lily, single woman, painter, enact their feminity mean? How do they deal with and understand and love each other? What forces do they unleash on each other?<br />The book deals skillfully with the perception of the passage of time, as &quot;The Window&quot; deals with that short bit, focusing, I found, the book's most amazing and engaging section on the dinner party that night. The second section, &quot;Time Passes,&quot; is merely 20 pages, but covers ten years, and the final section, &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; is one morning. There are all kinds of<br />reminders of the fluidity of time in the text, a skull of an animal on the wall in the children's nursery that causes them to be unable to sleep, as well as Mrs. Ramsay's glance back into the dining room at the end of the party and her realization that the success of the evening, which was somewhat hard won, is ephemeral and over, already in the past.<br />The second section has a different view of time, almost looking at the house from nature's point of view as time ravages the house through the war when the family isn't using it. It's very meditative. Major events in the lives of the people who attended the dinner are enclosed in brackets, as side notes, for the passage of time and the entropy that ensues is the major drama here. We see the lives and deaths of the characters as small things, part of a greater cycle that winds on and on in a more eternal, less fleeting, way.<br />What Woolf begins in the first section, she deals with more strongly in the third, I think, and that is that the validity of each person's differing perception of the others is equal. Two of the Ramsay children, James and Cam, go with their father and a fisherman and his boy to the lighthouse in the sailboat. James despises his father, while Cam sees his weaknesses and loves him for his vulnerabilities. She knows how James feels and feels drawn to protect James, too, but she knows a different father than James does.<br />I think that was what struck me the most about the book, the way the characters' combined perceptions assemble a greater truth and understanding than each of them singly has.<br />Woolf has a great insight and beautifully descriptive and engaging way of writing about thought as dramatic and intimate. Woolf writes about such things, the pleasure of picking up a pleasant and soothing thought so elegantly, that it doesn't seem to be writing on a page, but access to another's mind, and the part of the truth he or she holds.<br />And overall the writing is simply stunning.<br />In the first section, one of the characters loses a brooch on the beach, and they discuss going back to look for it the next day. By the time the book ends, the lost brooch seems so far away, in some deep and distant memory.

The writing is beautiful, and the story is built on or inspired by The Odyssey. (I found it a more artistic \\"inspiration\\" novel than \\"The Hours\\" that was inspired by \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" That novel almost stole things outright from Woolf. Frazier is able to incorporate very rich and meaningful references to underscore the archetypal aspects of the Odyssey without relying so much on it that his own insight and work is cheapened.)<br />Inman is a man from Cold Mountain who has served as a soldier for the Confederacy. After being wounded, he walks out of the hospital and intends making the long trek home. His adventures call to mind incidents from Homer's Odyssey, such as the Lotus Eaters and the killing of the Sun God's cattle (this scene, which<br />substitutes a bear for the cows, is painfully sad and after everything, I found it almost unbearable). Ada is the woman Inman has left behind. They have only flirted, but their connection is real and powerful enough for him to think of her on his long trek home. She is Penelope to a degree, and there is a brief allusion to the suitors who eat her out of house and home. She makes an agreement with a woman who helps her manage her farm and lives there, but is NOT a servant. Ada, the daughter of the parish's late minister, has realized that her finishing school and painting lessons have not helped her to manage the house and farm on her own. She and Ruby work the land to make something of it.<br />The overwhelming feeling of this novel is sadness and loss. The poverty of the South during (at the end of) the war is palpable on every page. There is also a theme that it is the poverty and baseness of the lowlands that Inman is trying to escape to the lush, safety of the mountains. The writing is beautiful. There is a scene of a gunfight on horses and one white horse goes down and struggles \\"like the ghost of a horse\\" writes Frazier. You can find passages like that on every page.he ghost of a horse\\" writes Frazier. You can find passages like that on every page.	2003-07-03
US	52928260	R26U03NW08ZSEG	067978330X	176699089	Anna Karenina (Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	21	24	N	N	A most artistic recreation of life	After two months, I have finished the great novel ANNA KARENINA by Leo Tolstoy that was given to me by Jenny and Gerry (thank you!). I was nervous to take it on, this edition has 924 pages, but I am so, so, so glad that I did. I enjoyed almost every bit of the book, and feel I have from reading it a new understanding of writing and of literature.<br />This edition from Modern Library Classics was translated from the Russian by Constance Garnett with a revision by Leonard Kent and Nina Berberova. The prose reads very easily, in clear, accessible English for today. (But don't worry: It's not &quot;The Good News Bible does Tolstoy.&quot;) While the book is long, and by looking at a calendar and my new paperback's rumpled cover and scuffed binding, I could tell I'd been reading it a long time, it felt as if it were passing quickly. Tolstoy's narrative moves easily from stage to stage -- there's no feeling of contrived suspense or narrative manipulation. The lives of the characters progress naturally, and what Tolstoy tells the reader, the reader believes and doesn't question (this reader didn't.)<br />The story focuses on just a few main characters, Anna Arkadyevna Karenina (and her husband Aleksey Alexandrovich Karenin), Count Aleksey Kirilich Vronksy, Konstantin Dmitrich Levin and Kitty Scherbatskaya. These individuals propel the story, and it is their lives and relationships that we follow most closely. Supporting characters include Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky, his wife Darya Alexandrovna Oblonskaya and Levin's brothers, a small cast for a grand Russian novel.<br />On the back cover, a quote about the novel, attributed to Matthew Arnold, says that we are &quot;not to take ANNA KARENINA as a work of art; we are to take it as a slice of life.&quot; I think it is really both.<br />The theme of the novel centers on relationships, and those relationships in 19th Century Russian artistocratic society of St. Petersburg and Moscow. Anna Karenina is an elite, beautifulwoman married to a powerful government official, Aleksey Karenin, with whom she has a son, Seryozha. She falls in love with and has an extended affair with the rich, dapper Count Aleksey Vronksy, and has a child with him, a daughter. Their story follows her inability to ask for or later receive a divorce from her husband, and her increasing unhappiness in the relationship with Vronsky, as she is bannished by society and resents the freedom he has as a man to move in his old circles. Her jealousy and insecurity grow throughout the course of the novel, rendering her nearly mad.<br />The other relationship, which serves as a contrast and foil for Karenina and Vronsky, is that of Levin and Kitty Scherbatskaya. Levin is a somewhat older man than the young and beautiful Kitty, daughter of one of Moscow's many princes. He is an aristocratic farmer and cares for his family's vast agrarian holdings in the country thoughtfully and meticulously. At the beginning of the novel, he has been courting Kitty, but had returned to the country for awhile. When he returns to ask her to marry him, he sees that she is infatuated with Vronksy, whom he doesn't trust. Vronsky meets Anna Karenina at a ball and stops calling on Kitty, breaking her heart. After a long separation, Kitty and Levin meet again and she agrees to marry him, happily. Their storyline follows their marriage and the birth of their son, Dimitry.<br />It is definitely true that this novel is most definitely a slice out of life. The characters are incredibly realistic as is the pace and plot of the novel. But the artistry lies in Tolstoy's effective setting of one relationship against another. It's not as black and white as it might be in a lesser writer's hands. The &quot;good couple&quot; Levin and Kitty have difficulties in adjusting to each other and in their relationship. Levin, like Anna, is jealous, but unlike Vronsky and Anna, he is motivated by love and generosity to overcome his angry feelings for the benefit ofa harmonious home.

I was nervous to take it on, this edition has 924 pages, but I am so, so, so glad that I did. I enjoyed almost every bit of the book, and feel I have from reading it a new understanding of writing and of literature.<br />This edition from Modern Library Classics was translated from the Russian by Constance Garnett with a revision by Leonard Kent and Nina Berberova. The prose reads very easily, in clear, accessible English for today. (But don't worry: It's not &quot;The Good News Bible does Tolstoy.&quot;) While the book is long, and by looking at a calendar and my new paperback's rumpled cover and scuffed binding, I could tell I'd been reading it a long time, it felt as if it were passing quickly. Tolstoy's narrative moves easily from stage to stage -- there's no feeling of contrived suspense or narrative manipulation. The lives of the characters progress naturally, and what Tolstoy tells the reader, the reader believes and doesn't question (this reader didn't.)<br />The story focuses on just a few main characters, Anna Arkadyevna Karenina (and her husband Aleksey Alexandrovich Karenin), Count Aleksey Kirilich Vronksy, Konstantin Dmitrich Levin and Kitty Scherbatskaya. These individuals propel the story, and it is their lives and relationships that we follow most closely. Supporting characters include Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky, his wife Darya Alexandrovna Oblonskaya and Levin's brothers, a small cast for a grand Russian novel.<br />On the back cover, a quote about the novel, attributed to Matthew Arnold, says that we are &quot;not to take ANNA KARENINA as a work of art; we are to take it as a slice of life.&quot; I think it is really both.<br />The theme of the novel centers on relationships, and those relationships in 19th Century Russian artistocratic society of St. Petersburg and Moscow. Anna Karenina is an elite, beautiful woman married to a powerful government official, Aleksey Karenin, with whom she has a son, Seryozha. She falls in love with and has an extended affair with the rich, dapper Count Aleksey Vronksy, and has a child with him, a daughter. Their story follows her inability to ask for or later receive a divorce from her husband, and her increasing unhappiness in the relationship with Vronsky, as she is bannished by society and resents the freedom he has as a man to move in his old circles. Her jealousy and insecurity grow throughout the course of the novel, rendering her nearly mad.<br />The other relationship, which serves as a contrast and foil for Karenina and Vronsky, is that of Levin and Kitty Scherbatskaya. Levin is a somewhat older man than the young and beautiful Kitty, daughter of one of Moscow's many princes. He is an aristocratic farmer and cares for his family's vast agrarian holdings in the country thoughtfully and meticulously. At the beginning of the novel, he has been courting Kitty, but had returned to the country for awhile. When he returns to ask her to marry him, he sees that she is infatuated with Vronksy, whom he doesn't trust. Vronsky meets Anna Karenina at a ball and stops calling on Kitty, breaking her heart. After a long separation, Kitty and Levin meet again and she agrees to marry him, happily. Their storyline follows their marriage and the birth of their son, Dimitry.<br />It is definitely true that this novel is most definitely a slice out of life. The characters are incredibly realistic as is the pace and plot of the novel. But the artistry lies in Tolstoy's effective setting of one relationship against another. It's not as black and white as it might be in a lesser writer's hands. The &quot;good couple&quot; Levin and Kitty have difficulties in adjusting to each other and in their relationship. Levin, like Anna, is jealous, but unlike Vronsky and Anna, he is motivated by love and generosity to overcome his angry feelings for the benefit of a harmonious home. Other aspects of the two differentrelationships are set off by one another. A very compelling character is made of Aleksey Alexandrovich Karenin, whom Anna despises, but who undergoes a convincing and sad degeneration of self as Anna leaves him and he maintains custody of the son that she loves.

US	52928260	R1K9STOCTDDSF3	042515999X	337776847	The Solitaire Mystery: a novel about family and destiny	Books	4	18	19	N	N	A quest for undertanding	In a story within a story, \\"The Solitaire Mystery\\" by Jostein Gaarder follows a sailor who gets shipwrecked on an island and finds another man there, also a cast away, who had been lost there 52 years before. The older man lives on the island with 53 strange little people, who on a certain celebratory day, prepare a sentence for a grand story. No one knows the sentences of the others (they can barely remember their own), and the \\"court jester\\" among them arranges them so the story is coherent, representative of the past and present and also so it prophesizes the future.<br />All this is read by a 12-year-old boy, Hans Thomas, who is traveling from Norway with his father by car to Greece, where Hans Thomas's mother is living. She had left the family eight years before to become a model and neither Hans Thomas nor his father, an arm-chair philosopher, has heard from her since. Hans has a problem with his remaining parent, too. He drinks too much, and gets drunk regularly on the journey south.<br />But when a funny little man gives Hans Thomas a strange magnifying glass, and a baker in Dorf gives him a correspondingly tiny book baked into a sticky bun, Hans is the connection between the two stories, living out his quest to go get his \\"Mommy\\" in Greece, and spending time reading the story of the mysterious island and the strange people who inhabit it. There are obvious connections between Hans Thomas's journey, his problems in life and who he is with the sticky-bun book's plot, which is very complex, with many seemingly disparate aspects and facets.<br />As the story progresses, the themes of the essence of being, of God's role in the world, destiny and the joy of being alive/the beauty of the world resonate in both stories. Gaarder, a former philosophy teacher in Norway, concentrates on these aspects of philosophy, using both stories to illustrate his themes and intrigue his reader.<br />While I read that this is a young adult book, I found it quite engaging, particularly once I was able to devote enough time to it at one sitting to be swept up in the plot. For some time it alternates chapters between Hans's journey and the journey in the sticky-bun book, at which point the relationships between them become apparent and compelling. I also read a lot of comparison's to Gaarder's well known novel \\"Sophie's World,\\" which I've also read. I think the comparison, while natural, isn't necessarily that helpful. \\"Sophie's World\\" was translated from the Norwegian into English first, but was written after \\"Solitaire\\" and is different; While both deal with philosophical themes and young adults, \\"Sophie's World\\" is a kind of brief history of philosophy. \\"The Solitaire Mystery\\" concentrates on the above-mentioned themes in a way that is fulfilling to any age of reader; the themes make the philosophical issues a support for a riveting plot.<br />I recommend this novel. It's fun and fantastic, but leaves you feeling pleasantly full of ideas and reactions, as well as appreciative of the life we get to live.larly once I was able to devote enough time to it at one sitting to be swept up in the plot.

US	52928260	R1VYHLXLLZX6Y1	0684800713	781452863	The Sun Also Rises	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Sad look at expats	This is the first time that I read this book, and I really enjoyed it (though I think that A FAREWELL TO ARMS is my favorite of the two). I loved reading it aloud for the humor in the dialog that becomes apparent more when spoken, and I've known people who were so inspired by this novel that they've gone all the way to Pamplona to see the Running of the Bulls for themselves.<br />There are some themes that emerged throughout and became part of the hum of the book, loneliness of the lifestyle, even though it sounds quite nice at first blush -- living without obligations turns to living aimlessly; stopping into a pub for a drink all the time, turns to a soggy, fogged existence affected by too much alcohol and drunkeness; traveling as you please turns to physical aimlessness and a desire to have someone to go to; and being so free turns to being lonely (even the traveler that Jake and Bill meet in the fishing town in Spain seems almost unbearably lonely).<br />Hemingway's prose is engrossing and seems to kind of motor you forward, forward, forward. Again, as I was with FAREWELL, I was blown away by the contradiction of the kind of journalistic, unemotional writing and the high level of emotions reading Hemingway produces due to the intimacy that the style makes one feel with the protagonist. I really enjoyed it again here.<br />However, I wonder if there isn't something about this novel that appeals more to men, generally speaking. I liked it, but I wasn't as moved by it as the other novel of his that I've read. I don't know that I'd go all the way to Spain based on this work alone. Perhaps its the theme of the insecurity of the men, their vulnerability to Brett that resonates with men. I just didn't like Brett too much (and thought Hemingway didn't either).	2003-05-20

Teenager Susie Salmon has been raped and murdered in the field near her home in the 1970s, and she is telling us her story from heaven, as she watches the world go on below her. The premise is fascinating and the first 100 pages or so offer a new possible insight into such crimes and such deaths, the idea that Susie has to let go of life as those alive must let go of her is strangely comforting as well as pitch perfect.<br />But as the story went on, I became disappointed and thought some of that promise was not fulfilled. As my friend Sarah said, \\"It's a big responsibility to write about life in heaven.\\" I felt to an extent that Sebold didn't hold up her end of the bargain. Some of the story lines seemed a little too neat or trite, and sometimes pretty unbelievable. The attraction of the book and its beginning are compelling because one wants to believe (and is willing to suspend one's disbelief over exactly what heaven might be like), but some of the plot lines came too easily, and some of the promises of the opening, I believed, were not fulfilled. Susie's letting go of her family, seemed to happen very suddenly, and without adequate focus leading up to it.<br />But even with that complaint, I recommend the novel. Some of the main points are in no way predictable, and what it gives one to consider is meaningful, even if you quibble with plot points.	2003-04-21
US	52928260	R23ABR30P6N0OC	1569249814	853388152	All Said and Done: The Autobiography of Simone De Beauvoir 1962-1972	Books	3	16	18	N	N	At the end, another fine biography	All Said and Done by Simone de Beauvoir is the final of five volumes of de Beauvoirs autobiography, and is different from those that precede it, which basically progress on a chronological basis. This book is arranged thematically, and de Beauvoir picks up a theme or area of her life, addresses it for the 10 years that the book focuses on, 1962 to 1972. Early in the volume, she addresses books shes read, movies, theater productions, etc. A particularly interesting chapter focuses on the deaths of some of the people she has known, including Sartres mother and de Beauvoirs close friend, Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti. While these sections have interesting moments, the brief time she spends on each book, movie, or production and the shortness of the sections isnt a very engaging read. The discussion is really a gloss, and feels a little obligatory on de Beauvoirs part.<br /> The book really picks up in pace and interest when de Beauvoir moves on to address the travels shes taken in these ten years toward the end of her life (she died in 1986). She first goes through trips she made for fun, with Sartre or on  her own. Then she addresses trips they took for primarily political reasons, to Egypt, to Israel, to Russia, Estonia, etc. Shes always a very engaging travel writer as she has a deep knowledge of the places shes traveling, and, often  especially on the political trips  she and Sartre are given guides and access to things one might not be able to see on ones own.<br /> Toward the end of the book, she writes about her feelings about the Vietnam War, going into some detail about two tribunals that worldwide intelligentsia held to try the United States for war crimes in Vietnam, particularly for genocide (the United States was found guilty). De Beauvoir was very against Frances actions in Algeria, and she now turned her attention toward what she felt was a violation of the rights of the Vietnamese for self-determination to make a statement with her colleagues on their political situation.<br /> This book was illuminating of de Beauvoirs character in a rather new way. Toward the end, she emerged to me as something of an ideologue, rather than a woman who was committed to certain principles that she addressed issue by issue. When the students took over the Sorbonne in the late 1960s, she supported their actions because it was to overthrow the status quo; the students wanted more control of their studies, they wanted to abolish the class system between students and faculty and they didnt want to have to accept professors edicts. She seems, from this book, to believe that any system that is very long held should be overthrown on that point alone. She was disappointed when she and other editors at Les Temps moderne offered the rebellious students an opportunity to write for their political review and the student leaders turned them down because their publication had become an institution (it was too long standing). She does not comment on this.<br /> Also in the late 1960s, de Beauvoir and Sartre officially broke with the Soviet Union, which they had supported as part of the noncommunist left for some time, because of its actions in Czechoslovakia. While de Beauvoir constantly ridiculed the United States for its imperialism, up until this time, even after visiting Estonia and Lithuania after they were controlled by the U.S.S.R., she did not criticize the Soviet government. But after the Prague Spring was crushed, she and Sartre had to admit that they were not pleased with the thought-police actions of the Soviets and their interpretation of the communist party. She also laments that Marx is so disregarded in the U.S.S.R. by the time of this volume, that there is no longer any one there who can speak with authority on Marxist theory or philosophy.<br /> I really enjoyed this volume, for its differences with its sister volumes, and for what it reveals about de Beauvoir. I recommend it, and think it could certainly stand on its own.and think it could certainly stand on its own.	2003-04-13

Lady Susan is a vile woman who is flirting her way through England after the death of her husband. She comes early in the short book to stay with her late husband's brother's family. Her sister-in-law, Catherine Vernon, shares horrified letters with her mother about Lady Susan's designs on her brother, Reginald de Courcy. She is also horrified by Lady Susan's treatment of her daughter with the late Lord Vernon, Frederica.<br />The novel isn't quite as rewarding as Austen's other works that I've read (\\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" \\"Emma,\\" \\"Persuasion,\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") in that the ending isn't as compelling and is a little predictable. The letter format of the book is charming, but difficult to read aloud, as we did. I found the characters more one-sided than Austen normally writes them.

US	52928260	R2CRH18D7IBSLE	0156628708	179043206	Mrs. Dalloway	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A day in many lives	\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by Virginia Woolf was a surprise to me, even though I thought I had an idea of what to expect. It was a lovely surprise, actually.<br />I knew it was considered an \\"experimental\\" novel, and focused on only one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a 50-something wife of an upper class and successful, but not quite successful enough governmental official. But I didn't know that the stream of consciousness as Clarissa prepares for a party that evening, and remembers and considers her life, is shared among multiple characters. I loved the way the viewpoint flowed among the characters, in a way, as if once they shared an experience on the street or in the park, the point of view would switch to the next person and follow him or her. It was fascinating and done even-handedly.<br />The flow of point of view brought out some key differences in the characters. Clarissa, while one empathizes with her, seems shallow and self-involved when compared with Septimus, the only one of the main characters who doesn't appear at the party at the end of the day. Septimus is seriously mentally ill, the result of shell shock from World War I. He has an Italian wife he has brought back to London with him from the war, and she is beside herself with worry. Her husband talks to people who aren't there. He writes cryptic notes to himself and leaves them about. She can't connect with him anymore. When it's her point of view, her loneliness is palpable and painful. She's losing hope. Septimus, who watched his war buddy die and \\"took it like a man\\" is afraid he no longer feels anything, and has been getting \\"treatment\\" from a family practitioner who has no idea what to do for his psychological problems.<br />Meanwhile, Clarissa prepares for her party by mending her gown. Her former love interest, the man she was involved with before she became engaged to her husband, Richard, comes back into her life from India and drops in her. She remembers that she always feels judged by Peter Walsh and sees him as someone who has made poor and ruinous errors in judgment where women are concerned. He's in London to get a divorce for his new interest, an Indian woman married to an Indian military officer, so that he can be with her. His being back in London and her receiving him in her home causes them to remember their pasts, including a woman, Sally, they had both known, who was very antiestablishment, and with whom Clarissa seems to have been in love, as well.<br />The day moves forward, and the author ingeniously inserts chiming clocks throughout the narrative to keep the reader anchored in time as the characters' minds flow back and forth over the years and the recent days. The contrast of Clarissa's and Septimus's lives is striking, and there is an idea that Peter Walsh's connection with India, Clarissa's thoughts about her own death and Septimus's pain over the death of his friend and his lack of feeling are commenting on a coming demise of the British Empire. When some characters speak of a patient's death during Clarissa's party, she is selfishly offended; though someone has died, she feels very petulantly negative toward those guests, thinking that they have \\"brought death to my party.\\"<br />The book is very thoughtful, very considered, and always, of course, subjective. It's a wonder to read because although it flows so well among all these people who tend to answer each other and make pointed contrasts, there is a lot to think about within this one day. One gains from this perception: You know Clarissa's feelings and you know others feelings about her. It's an interesting way to see a fictional character.0 I would like to read it again sometime, just because I know there's a lot more there.<br />I did want to mention that having read \\"The Hours\\" by Michael Cunningham, I wanted to read this novel, which inspired it. After reading \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" I like \\"The Hours\\" less. Things that I credited Cunningham for were taken, sometimes whole, from \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" and I did feel that the end of \\"The Hours\\" seemed wrong, not quite believable, not quite what we were led ahead into. \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" did not disappoint in this way.Mrs. Dalloway,\\" and I did feel that the end of \\"The Hours\\" seemed wrong, not quite believable, not quite what we were led ahead into. \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" did not disappoint in this way.	2003-04-06

The story centers around a man, Andrews, who has been involved in smuggling with some blackguards, and who has fled the group after a crime was committed. He flees right into the home of a woman, Elizabeth, who is in the process of burying the man who has been her guardian of sorts. She convinces him to testify against the other smugglers at the trial, and he goes to the city to do so. When he returns they profess their love for each other but face further dangers together. In the end, Andrews must face the negative influence his father has been on him in his life and the actions he has committed in reaction to that influence.<br />While there were some interesting facets of the book and its characters, I took a long time to get into it. The beginning, particularly, is VERY slow moving. The novel lacks the things one loves Greene for; the subtly written yet overwhelmingly powerful struggles the characters engage in with morality and/or religion, as well as a narrator who is unreliable and yet sympathetic.	2003-03-17

And Here My Troubles Began	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Powerful	I guess it is ironic to say that one \\"loves\\" this work, though I do. It's upsetting obviously, and I think Spiegelman does something new with this Holocaust memoir, actually a graphic novel, which is that he not only chronicals humanity's inhumanity to humanity, but also the pain of growing up with someone whose personality facilitated his living through the Holocaust but makes it nearly impossible for anyone else to live through living with him. Spiegelman artfully (no pun) illustrates with his narrative the horror of the Holocaust and the painful demanding self-involvement of Vladek Spiegelman, his father.<br />The book is CLEVER, too. The Jews are mice, the Poles pigs, the Germans cats and the Americans dogs. But in a little narrative digression into the narrator's psychoanalysis in real life, he portrays himself as wearing a mouse mask.<br />I was reading these two books very quickly for the narrative, but felt I was probably missing a lot in the drawings that support the plot and narrative.<br />I really liked this work.

No one asks men how they manage to combine career and fatherhood, writes Pearson.) While the book has been compared to \\"Bridget Jones's Diary,\\" (for its colloquial tone and semi-daily-diary form), Reddy is not Jones. Jones was kind of a lovable buffoon, but Reddy is a high-ranking fund manager for a major investment bank in London. A Cambridge graduate married to an architect, Reddy tries to make sure that everyone in her life gets her 100 percent. Of course, she fails and feels herself going under as she drowns in all her commitments.<br />What I thought was most effective about the novel was the way that Pearson so clearly lets us in on the emotional conflicts that Kate has about her job and children. Reddy e-mails a friend (but doesn't send it) that though her job is very stressful, she almost views it as a vacation because her children's emotional need of her is too exhausting. She writes that in a weekend or miniholiday together, she lives through the throes of an entire relationship with her daughter Emily and son Ben, they need her, they love her, she's beautiful, they hate her, they rebel, they want intimacy, they want to be left alone.<br />Reddy performs all her duties at work and some of them at home, but it all is in an attitude of \\"I have to do this.\\" She doesn't seem to enjoy playing with her kids or doing her job; everything, including her marriage seems like an incredible burden. I thought Pearson did a good job of letting us into this woman's stressful, overextended life.<br />I did think, too, that Pearson portrayed VERY well the competition that exists among women. Reddy is very intimidated by the women she calls members of the \\"Muffia,\\" who stay at home full time, make everything home made and book entertainment for their children's parties years in advance.<br />I did not enjoy the \\"Court of Motherhood\\" sections.

But the artistry is pleasant and doesn't often feel strained. I read this book because I've been hearing wonderful things about the movie (and the previews look so goood!), but that movie is not likely to ever come to Aberdeen.<br />The book focuses on a single day in the lives of three women living at different times, Virginia Woolf, in a fictionalized account of a day in the 1920s when she is writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway;\\" Laura Brown, a depressive suburban housewife in Los Angeles in the 1950s who is reading \\"Mrs. Dalloway;\\" and Clarissa Vaughn, nicknamed \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by her longtime friend for whom she is giving a party that night. This last takes place in the 1990s in Greenwich Village.<br />Cunningham moves very smoothly among the women's lives, and the similarities in their thoughts and reactions that he writes of here are beautifully subtle and somewhat rhythmic. (I understand, too, that there are small allusions to the original \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" novel in some plot points, particularly for Clarissa, but I haven't read that book yet.) The day progresses through the 224-page book with the three women in tandem. Other characters play important parts, Virginia Woolf's husband and her sister's family, Clarissa's friend Richard, for whom she is giving the party and who is dying of AIDS, Clarissa's partner, Sally, and Laura Brown's son and neighbor, Kitty.<br />The women are linked in a somewhat surprising way at the end, which helps drive the novel; you rather sense that there's something making them be involved with each other, even \\"through time.\\" But the plot isn't really what kept me reading. (And a major plot point at the end disappointed me-it seemed to me to divert the focus from the characters the novel has been focusing on throughout the book. It just rang false against what Cunningham had already set up.)<br />The way that the author describes the mental lives of these women, particularly Laura Brown, was fascinating to me. Often the women think to themselves, \\"this is enough. Sometimes it is just enough\\" and seem wonderfully satiated with the small beauties of life. But for Laura, there is an oppressiveness about the contentment that drains you as a reader, but is very rich.

Books	1	29	35	N	N	You won't learn much here, except how to be like them	&quot;Things You Need To Be Told&quot; by the Etiquette Grrls, Honore McDonough Ervin and Lesley Carlin is not really, when you get down to it, an etiquette book at all. It's more a book of how to behave, think and shop like Honore and Lesley, two obviously very privileged New England women, who come off many times like snobs. Whilst their style of Random Capitalization and Franglais can be funny at times, the overall impression is that etiquette is a way of distinguishing the \\"well-bred\\" from the Great Unwashed. I was under the impression that etiquette is useful because it is rooted in mutual respect, not snobbishness. I find the EGs to be very snobby, indeed.<br />There are some interesting things in the book, and some good etiquette tips are here to be gleaned, but you have to get through the sections on why you should wear a particular brand of nail polish (Urban Decay), what kind of writing paper you should use(never say stationery for some reason, and it should be Crane's) and what kind of neighborhood bar you should frequent (huh?). I found the most offensive part of the volume to be the EGs' Patois (a glossary) in the back, which seemed to nail down their particular prejudices and personal beliefs of their own superiority.<br />I think I'll stick to Miss Manners, Judith Martin, from now on. Ms. Martin seems genuinely concerned with helping people to feel comfortable among each other instead of giving them reasons to dislike -- and feel superior to -- the others around them.	2003-01-20

At the end of Prime, France had been liberated, but the WWII was not over, and this book outlines the end of the conflict and the emergence of the non-Communist left, which de Beauvoir later fictionalizes in The Mandarins. Again, she writes compellingly of her life in Paris with her famous circle of friends including Jean Genet, Albert Camus, Richard Wright and Alberto Giacometti. She writes of interesting travels, including a trip she took to Northern Africa, and of Sartres work and her own writing (during the course of this book, she writes All Men Are Mortal, The Second Sex and she drafts The Mandarins).<br />But the central focus of this volume is her love affair with Chicago writer Nelson Algren (The Man with the Golden Arm). She meets Algren on a tour she makes of the United States that is funded by a group that brings her over on a reading/lecture tour. (She and Sartre are now becoming famous by the years of this book, 1944 to 1952.) She spends time with him in the United States, making a trip south through the southwest, Mexico and Guatamala with him, which she doesnt outline completely here as she has written of it more extensively in her book America Day by Day. The relationship runs its course within the pages of this book as Algren gives up on her ever being for him what he wants, remarrying his ex-wife by the last pages. Resigned to this fate, not able to leave Sartre or France (though she and Sartre seem to have an agreement to share finances, take long vacations together and work together, they never lived together and are free to see others as they wish), she is still very disappointed by the end of the affair. On the last visit to his cabin outside Chicago, she says she is glad they have come to a mutual understanding and will be friends. Algren replies to her that he can never offer her anything less than love.<br />The French intelligentsia during this time are grappling with the knowledge of the Holocaust and the onset of the Cold War. Sartre and de Beauvoir were deeply sympathetic with the worlds communists, but Sartre never joined the party, apparently because he couldnt countenance on a daily basis the thought-control aspect of the central committee. De Beauvoir writes quite a bit about the various left and right publications in Paris at the time, the political views of their editorial boards and the personal and political attacks that were made from their various pages. Their friendship with Camus breaks up by the end of the book as he has become too anti-communist for Sartre and de Beauvoir and the other editors of their monthly publication, Les Temps Modernes.<br />This was a much quicker read than the first two, but engaging in the same episodic way. I dont know if it could as easily stand on its own, as she references many things from the second volume as if one should know of them. The story of her love affair with Algren is very moving and sad, and she writes from time to time of difficult times, emotionally, as she ages and confronts herself as a woman in her 40s, making a name for herself.will be friends.

But as I made my way forward, I found the same compelling qualities of the first, and more -- as de Beauvoir is older: Her interests and her circle of friends are expanding.<br />This book is interesting on so many levels, and I would recommend it to stand on its own (it doesn't have to be read as part of the whole), as well. It's interesting, as the first one was, for the way she describes her life in Paris at the time (she names all the cafes, neighborhoods, etc., that she frequents), and, as the first one, because it still dwells on how she is beginning her professional life that would lead her to be one of the foremost twentieth century philosophers and writers. So it's got something on both personal and broader themes.<br />But this book also adds the elements of the writer, as during its years, de Beauvoir writes her first books \\"She Came to Stay\\" and \\"The Blood of Others.\\" I like to read about how writers work, their processes, and de Beauvoir very interestingly dissects her work in retrospect, writing things like, \\"What I was trying to accomplish at the time through Francoise's character was... but I see now that she comes across as ...\\" De Beauvoir was a very vigilant and disciplined worker, researcher and writer, and she writes of these routines. For writers interested in how others work, where they get their ideas and how they edit and redraft, I would certainly recommend this.<br />But this work is also interesting on another level; its most compelling part is when she details the beginning of WWII and the occupation of Paris. Rather than summarize it with the view the passing years have given her, de Beauvoir excerpts her diaries from the time, so that the reader feels the fears, understands the unknown dangers that she felt and gets the immediacy and intimacy of the worries of Parisiens such as de Beauvoir. I really couldn't put these sections down as she wrote about fleeing the Nazi occupiers, then deciding that if Sartre were released, he would only be able to find her in Paris and her desperate journey home again.<br />The book also starts a theme I can see will continue in all of them, outlining her travels as she (sometimes alone, sometimes with Sartre or others) goes around France and abroad and writes of how she feels and what she discovers there. In this volume, to name a few, she goes to Greece, Spain and all over<br />France.<br />The voice of these autobiographies is somewhat distant and aloof, which I find useful, as she seems intent on presenting her life very objectively, but when Sartre is attacked or criticized, she loses this coolness of tone and makes personal attacks on his critics.<br />The last aspect I'll mention of this long volume (nearly 500 pages) is the circle of friends she creates. She happens to befriend Alberto Giacometti, who is my favorite artist, in Paris and writes very fondly of his intellect and engaging conversations. She meets Hemingway and is an aquaintance of Picasso and his longtime lover Dora Marr. She also meets Cocteau through Sartre's theatrical work.<br />I found the wartime writing of this second one particularly engaging and probably of wider interest than the episodes of de Beauvoir's daily life later on... but we'll see!s when she details the beginning of WWII and the occupation of Paris.

US	52928260	R1371FJO2NUCRP	0140185003	179354174	The Quiet American (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)	Books	5	22	23	N	N	And yet another Great Greene	The Quiet American by Graham Greene is a typically great Greene novel. The more I read by Greene, the more I admire and respect and LOVE to read his work. This novel is set in Vietnam during the Vietnamese fight against French rule (before heavy American involvement). The main character, and narrator, Fowler, is a British reporter, going through the motions of filing his reports, living with his Vietnamese girlfriend, Phuong, and, basically, living. He has a wife in Britain with whom his relationship is irretrievably broken down, but his wife refuses on religious grounds to grant him a divorce. Alden Pyle, the \\"quiet American\\" is a young man he meets from the American Legation, an idealistic and sort of willfully naïve man who seems to believe everything he reads in books about Vietnam, but doesn't seem to notice the life around him. Fowler, his opposite, seems dulled and soggy by his complete acceptance of the pain of reality, but even then the horror, violence and disregard for human life of full-out warfare does break in on him.<br />This book was recently made into a movie with Michael Caine as Fowler and Brendan Frasier as Pyle, which is why we picked it up to read aloud just now, but it is so wonderfully and timelessly Greene. It has the unreliable moral atmosphere of most Greene novels that I've read, with the antihero narrator that one dislikes while one empathizes with him. This is another Great Greene!	2002-12-22

In it, the Murry family (Meg is now an adult, married to Calvin O'Keefe and expecting their first child) finds out through a call from the President of the United States to her scientist father that a rogue South American dictator Mad Dog Branzillo has gotten a nuclear bomb and is expected to use it in the next 24 hours. Meg's mother-in-law is over for Thanksgiving dinner and mutters something about \\"Chuck\\" knowing what to do. Meg's precocious younger brother Charles Wallace goes out to the star-watching rock, says the rune that Meg's mother-in-law told him and a unicorn appears to take him to to different \\"whens\\" in the hope that Charles Wallace can go \\"within\\" different people from the past and change small things for the good that will make<br />the nuclear war threat nonexistent in their current time.<br />Throughout the book, Charles Wallace passes back and forth in the same place, going within different men \\"then\\" who clearly have a connection with both the South American dictator and Mother O'Keefe.<br />The really compelling thing about this book is the connection that is revealed through the family names that keep appearing at different eras of the family. To me, that was really evocative as I have recently learned a lot more about my own names and their importance in my family. Also, I think the book is very cleverly written without being \\"cute\\" or gimmicky, the climax is exciting. For instance, the rune of Mrs. O'Keefe structures the entire novel, each chapter is named for a line and the chapter reflects the spirit of the line.<br />I've read it several times before, and I enjoy it every time.	2002-12-05

It just seemed VERY different from the three previous books that I read as a teenager. This book is about Meg and Charles Wallace's twin brothers Sandy and Dennys. The boys mistakenly get taken up by one of their father's space-time experiments and find themselves in a desert, rescued by a small oasis-dwelling man named Japeth. It turns out that they have found themselves in the Biblical story of Noah before the flood. The book details some of L'Engle's suppositions about the daily life of the the people then and also elaborates on the supernatural life of the time... seraphim were common visitors to the people of Noah's oasis as were something called \\"nephilim,\\" which were once more godly creatures that turned their backs on god and began to marry and mate with humans. The boys get caught up in the stories of the relationships among all these \\"species\\" and have their own adventures. It's an interesting tale, but as I said, it is so different from the others, it wasn't what I expected.<br />The book is a little more overtly religious than the other books, but it's an interesting interpetation of what's always been a very puzzling chapter in Genesis (Gen 6) which talks about the sons of God mating with the daughters of men, and the Nephilim living among them. It's always seemed to be a bit of undigested ancient mythology that was never edited out of the biblical stories when Judaism became a more coherent and modern religion after the Babylonian exile. But l'Engel turns it into an interesting fantasy with a good deal of symbolic value, and makes it about love and faith and the miraculous power of God to bring good out of evil.<br />\\"Many waters cannot drown love,\\" we are told, and that seems to be the point of the story.	2002-12-05

Meg's extraordinary younger brother, Charles Wallace, seems to be ill -he is out of breath a lot, tires quickly, and Meg's mother seems worried about him, too. Meg is definitely concerned when Charles Wallace starts talking about having seen dragons in the pasture.<br />While this is going on with the family, Meg's mother, a scientist, is busy trying to locate and prove the existence of farandolae within the mitochondria of living cells. It turns out that Charles Wallace suffers from \\"mitochondritis,\\" which is causing his lack of energy. The little boy could be dying.<br />Meg and her boyfriend Calvin find themselves in a position to help Charles Wallace along with help from a \\"Teacher,\\" Blajeny, and a cherubim (the alleged dragons), Proginoskes. But, first, Meg has to identify the real Mr. Jenkins, the principal of the village elementary school and her personal nemesis, among three identical Mr. Jenkinses as a test.<br />When that is over, Meg, Calvin, Progo, et al., find themselves inside Charles Wallace's mitochondria, with a farandola, Sporos, who doesn't want to do what he is supposed to do as his part of the life cycle of the mitochondria, the cell, and of Charles Wallace - not to mention the galaxy and the universe. Meg and companions must find a way to defeat the evil that is turning Sporos and his peers from participating in the growth and health of the universe.<br />In this book, L'Engle introduces some new vocabulary in the series, \\"kything,\\" which is a kind of mental telepathy in which Meg can communicate with her brother and Calvin without words, and \\"ecthroi\\" which are the evil destroyers of the good in the universe. It is ecthroi who impersonate Mr. Jenkins and ecthroi who try to keep Sporos from deepening within the mitochondria for the ultimate health of Charles Wallace.<br />An interesting aspect of this book is L'Engle's focus on the irrelevance of size. She points out through her characters that a farandola is as tiny to a human as a human is to a galaxy. Her story centers around the evil that can occur on a microbiological level.<br />This book is for young adults, but I liked it better as an adult reader, as there were things about it I hadn't noticed before. I recommend it, though I didn't find it as well done as \\"Wrinkle.\\"<br />An interesting aspect of this book is L'Engle's focus on the irrelevance of size.

Fiver and Hazel are friends in a large and peaceful warren when Fiver, who is a kind of \\"seer,\\" senses great danger for all the rabbits who live there. The two rabbits meet with their chief rabbit, but he does not act on their warnings, so they leave with a group of rabbits, including Bigwig, a member of the Chief's guard, to find a safer home. They have many adventures on their way to Watership Down, where they decide to dig their new place. Then, they realize that a bunch of guys without women aren't going to have a warren for long, so hatch two plans to recruit female rabbits to their new warren. More adventures ensue, and a clever, funny, nail-biting, exciting and touching ending is reached.<br />It's such an engaging adventure story, and Adams tells it touchingly as an anthropological tale as well, including footnotes on lapine language (such as \\"Hrududu\\" for car, \\"elil\\" for enemies of rabbits, etc.) and culture and breaking up the line of the narrative with rabbit folklore of their trickster figure and their deities. The other warrens they encounter seem to be somewhat didactic plot devices in the book, but this aspect of the story does not overwhelm its charm and attraction.<br />It's a beautiful book and makes me look at rabbits in a new way! I recommend it and I think it would be good for young adults on through adulthood.	2002-11-04

I wanted it because I wanted to know more about Dworkin's career and politics, and I learned some about each from this, but obliquely, like through a scrim. The writing feels like it's been done from a distance, almost, which I guess most memoirs are, but when she's writing about the stories of women who were<br />raped or prostituted, the gloves come off, the profanity is on and she is harsh, tough and up-close.<br />She's harsh, politically, too. She has very definite positions and seems to believe that if you don't think like her, you're in most ways a hypocrite. She is very negative about the national organization of NOW, but positive about local chapters and organizers. She does at one point concede that some of the people who don't want to abolish pornography on free-speech grounds aren't all evil, but that's as close as she gets to<br />empathy for those on the left who are working, but not in tandem with her. I had read in a gender issues text at one time an essay that she co-wrote with Catherine A. MacKinnon - they wanted to get pornography outlawed on civil rights precedent - but this was pretty \\"naked\\" in comparison with that persuasive writing.<br />The title comes from the idea that she feels heartbreak all the time because of the women she meets who have been hurt by men and by women who would rather please men than help their sisters. She does seem very raw and disappointed with the world. A quote on the back of the book reads, \\"We should all treat<br />Andrea Dworkin like a national treasure for caring enough to engage our passions - wherever upon the political or social spectrum they may fall.\\" This was written by Deirdre Bair, who wrote a good biography I've read about Simone de Beauvoir. I think I would agree; I know that Dworkin has done important work to raise the awareness about women's issues, particularly pornography, in her lifetime. Even if you disagree, I think having a considered opinion is better than just following the status quo. With Dworkin around, the latter won't be an option.Even if you disagree, I think having a considered opinion is better than just following the status quo.

Friedman is worth reading, and probably even more so if you haven't followed his twice-weekly column in the Times for the past few years. The book is divided into three sections: columns before 9/11, columns after and a diary of Friedman's travels after September 11. It's interesting to read the columns all together, to feel the full force of Friedman's arguments at once, but I did think by the end of the diary, it was beginning to feel a little repetitive.<br />All the old gang of ideas from Friedman's theories are there: The globalization theme that walls are coming down, and as they do, those so far disenfranchised by global capitalism will work to defeat it, sometimes violently; that globalization itself is its own worst weakness by democratizing information, capital and technology even to those in societies in which there are no democratic hallmarks - a free press, equity for women and general civil rights - that the Arab world, particularly Saudi Arabia, is responsible for the lackluster future it offers its burgeoning younger generations and that this society's marriage to fundamentalist Islam as a justification for totalitarian regimes is a danger to everyone on the planet.<br />It's a good read and one that will probably change in resonance as we get further from 9/11/01 and find out how right or wrong Friedman's hypotheses are, or how correct his calls for specific actions may turn out to be.	2002-10-14

I had memorized when young the adventures of Meg Murry, her precocious brother Charles Wallace and their new friend Calvin O'Keefe, and rediscovering them 20 years later is even more wonderful than the first time around.<br />I always loved this book and its sequels. In \\"Wrinkle,\\" which won a Newberry Award, Meg Murry, a misfit at school, finds that her little brother, Charles Wallace, has befriended three very strange women who have begun living in an abandoned shed near their property. Meg is not a happy girl. She's not popular at school, and doesn't do well in her classes. Her mother, a beautiful scientist, tries to hide her loneliness because her husband, the father of Meg, Charles Wallace and the twins, Sandy and Dennys, has disappeared and hasn't been heard from in quite some time. It all seems to have something to do with a \\"tesseract,\\" which one of the strange ladies tells Mrs. Murry \\"does exist.\\"<br />Meg, Calvin and Charles, with the help of the three women have adventures in the quest of, yes, saving Dr. Murry. The tesseract (or a wrinkle in time and/or space) is a device of the story, but not its point. The novel, decidedly Christian, and perhaps a reaction to the Cold War during which it was written in 1962, is timeless and applicable to any religion or philosophy based on love and respect. The novel hinges on such love in a grand way, but it also communicates it in a thousand small ways throughout.<br />Meg is a heroine to whom any junior high girl could relate very well; the love she feels at home, as well as from the crazy women and the friendship that grows between her and Calvin was an affirmation to me when I was \\"her age.\\" I still love it.	2002-10-07

Many women can't attend school, can't go to the beach with their families, can't maintain visitation with their children if their husband suddenly decides to divorce her by merely declaring it so.<br />This book made me feel lucky to have the liberty and freedoms that I do as well as outraged that such treatment goes on today in the world.	2002-10-03

Macon and his wife, Sarah, have lost their 12-year-old son Ethan, who was killed by a gunman in a restaurant robbery. Sarah leaves Macon because his grief is \\"muffled.\\" (He says he iis \\"enduring.\\") Macon goes to live with his sister, Rose, and brothers Porter and Charles when he breaks his leg setting up one of many systems he has adopted in his home to make life easier, less burdensome. (He washes his clothes by stepping all over them in the shower every night, rather than do laundry. He makes \\"body bags\\" out of sheets so he doesn't have to go through all the labor of changing the sheets on the bed.) He finds while living with Rose and \\"the boys\\" that his dog, Edward, has become mean, biting him, growling and charging visitors, but he can't bear to give the dog up or put him to sleep because the dog was Ethan's. So, he hires Muriel Pritchett to help him train Edward.<br />Macon's occupation gives the book its title. He is a travel writer for business travelers, and he tells them how to travel without feeling like they're away from home. The series is titled \\"The Accidental Tourist.\\" Macon lives his life this way as well; his son's loss has scarred him deeply and he tries to remain withdrawn and untouched by other things in life. Muriel pursues him and he falls into a relationship with her and her son, Alexander, even though she is less educated, dresses flamboyantly, makes grammatical errors he finds annoying. He notices his family's eccentricities and religiously obrserved routines, but he's not sure he desires to be free of them. But he also cannot commit to Muriel. The relationship, his living there, his concern for Alexander are reluctant ... accidental.<br />Underneath everything is his grief over the loss of his son and his inability to move himself along or direct himself.<br />Everything here seems sad and lonely. Rose's romance with Macon's publisher can't withstand the pull of her routines at home. Macon's brothers are both divorced. Muriel's mother is critical and demeaning. Alexander is frail and lonely, teased and marginalized by the children at school. Macon misses his son.<br />I was sad when this ended, because I had grown to love the characters, even though they are strange, irritating and imperfect. I don't want to give away too much, but I will say that the ending is gratifying, without being trite or clich&eacute;. The grief never ebbs, but there are other trajectories in Macon's life (and the lives of those around him) that carry them to other satisfying destinations.ce with Macon's publisher can't withstand the pull of her routines at home.

But the book is not a doomsday scenario, quite the contrary, as the explanation of the title will show.<br />Fukuyama, who is Bernard Schwartz Professor of International Political Economy at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, published this work of political philosophy in 1992, and in it, he explains in a logical, well-considered progression why he believes that liberal democracy is the final resting point of progressive history, but that that very liberal democracy can render humanity as less than what it could be - comfort seeking, self-involved, \\"men without chests.\\"<br />The book, which could be subtitled \\"I Love Hegel and Why You Should, Too,\\" builds on Hegel's idea that there is a Universal, progressive History. This is to what Fukuyama is referring when he says that History has reached its end; he doesn't mean that nothing else will happen, but that the progression of History toward a universally beneficial system of government has culminated in liberal democracy. He defines liberalism - \\"Political liberalism can be defined simply as a rule of law that recognizes certain individual rights or freedoms from government control\\" and he defines those rights in three classes, civil rights, religious rights and political rights. He defines democracy as \\"the right held  universally by all citizens to have a share of political power, that is, the right of all  citizens to vote and participate in politics.\\"<br />His concentration on Hegel arises from Fukuyama's contention that we've been very conditioned by Karl Marx's influence to believe that most social and political problems come from economic and class differences. Fukuyama disagrees, saying that conflict comes from Hegel's theory that some people will risk their lives for prestige, or recognition. He writes that the aristocracy was created by such people - people who risked their lives for prestige and were able to enslave others. He writes that liberal democracy resolves the tension between slave and master because it makes the slaves their own masters.<br />But he cautions that Nietzsche believed in war and conflict as a way for humanity to express its passions, and that without conflict (Fukuyama says that liberal democracies do not attack each other), humans will become soft, meaningless, passionless, \\"men without chests.\\" Fukuyama does not advocate that people become \\"last men,\\" even though in this volume, he believes the End of History is being reached.<br />I read this book because Thomas L. Friedman faulted it for \\"not going far enough\\" in \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization,\\" but I wouldn't agree with that. Friedman clearly owes a lot to Fukuyama, directly or indirectly, and the roots of many of Friedman's ideas are explicated very elegantly here.<br />I find this book difficult to write about because it contains so many interrelated and complex ideas that are truly fascinating, including Fukuyama's views on the role of science in reaching the End of History. (In fact, in a newer book, \\"Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution,\\" he writes that the End of History may not have been reached because the End of Science hasn't been reached. So reads a review of this book on the Web.)<br />I highly recommend this book.

This novel is a modern-day &quot;House of Mirth&quot; and was clearly inspired by Edith Wharton's classic about Lily Bart, a woman who has been about too long in gilded-age New York society without making a suitable match. The main character of &quot;A Certain Age&quot;, Florence Collins, is in her early 30s, holds a socially respected but low-paying job at a second-tier auction house and is trying to find a man who'll marry her and make her rich.<br />Janowitz's biting portrayal of Florence and her New York set in late 1990s Manhattan is keen and engaging. And while she references Wharton and Austen and has Florence saying Lily Bart's line, \\"What is to become of me?\\" Florence is no Lily, though is utterly believable. While Lily failed to make a match because she could not compel herself at the moment of truth to marry men she looked down on or found attractive only for their money, Florence passes every one up because she doesn't think they'll pass muster with the social mores of her circle to which she is constantly holding herself up for judgment -- or she is only attracted to people who dislike her. While Lily is taken advantage of by those she believes would help her, Florence stupidly careens through life avoiding responsibility by thinking she'll make a good marriage and letting people mess her up for their own gain. In short, Lily is attractive - a sympathetic heroine. Florence is unlikable in her selfishness, her willful blindness, her shallow values and her absolutely intractable irresponsibility.<br />But the novel is NOT unlikable. It's well written, well paced, funny and shrewdly sarcastic. The narrator has a limited vantage point -- Florence's view of the world -- so everything comes to the reader through that scrim. While we frustratingly blurted out routinely, \\"WHAT IS SHE DOING?!\\" we couldn't stop turning the pages to find out what would happen next.<br />Without spoiling the ending, I will say that it here diverges from the plot of \\"Mirth\\" (there are ways in which the novel mimics it, with similar characters and plot lines) and ends in a completely believable way. I respected very much that Janowitz had the insight and ability not to set Florence's life up so well and then draw everything together poorly out of a need for a Hollywood-type resolution.<br />This book could well stand on its own as a very enjoyable and fun (and frustrating) read, however, with \\"Mirth\\" as a backdrop, it stands out even more as a comment on how far (or not) certain women have come in the twentieth century. I recommend it highly.are ways in which the novel mimics it, with similar characters and plot lines) and ends in a completely believable way.

Tom&aacute;, a serial womanizer, meets Tereza through a series of six coincidental circumstances in her hometown, and  when she comes to Prague to see him, she gets ill and has to stay for one week. He has never let a woman stay over before and this proximity incites feeling in her that he doesn't feel for his other women. When she returns to Prague for her second \\"visit\\" she brings all of her things with her. They eventually marry and get a puppy (a female, but whom they name Karenin and then ever after refer to as a male).<br />Tom&aacute; continues with his womanizing, however, seeing a longtime mistress, Sabina, after his marriage. Aware of this Tereza has terrible dreams, like the one in which she is in a swimming pool naked among many other naked women. If she doesn't do the right moves and bends at the right time, she will be shot by the sniper in a basket suspended above the pool. The sniper is Tom&aacute;.<br />Tom&aacute;, not usually politically active, is a surgeon, but after the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia to end the period of freedom under Dub&egrave;ek's Prague Spring, writes a letter to the editor that the communists and sympathizers who claim innocence through ignorance should not expect absolution. He says that Oedipus, who murdered his father and married his mother was as innocent as he could be, but when he found out the truth of his life, he did not feel innocent. He blinded himself and wandered away from Thebes. Tom&aacute; will not retract the letter and loses his job as a surgeon, becoming a window washer in Prague. This allows him to sleep with many, many women, while still married to Tereza.<br />After some time, Tom&aacute; and Tereza move to the country so that the communists cannot blackmail them to sign statements supporting the Party. (There's no point if there's nothing they can lose.)<br />This book is a love story, and is also about the world in which our main characters find themselves. Kundera's title comes from the fascination the book has with weight and lightness. Kundera, attributing this to Nietsche, says that eternal return (repetitive action or the idea that our lives recur an infinite number of times) is the heaviest of burdens, but Kundera says that life is so light because our decisions can only be made once, and we can't learn from one life for the next. We see this theme throughout the book, especially when the focus shifts to Karenin, the dog, whose life comprises eternal return as a dog's life comprises joyfully endless routine and repetition.<br />This novel is beautifully told. We find out about the end of Tom&aacute; and Tereza's lives in the middle of the book. The climax or apotheosis of the book is not their deaths but something wonderful that Tereza discovers in the little details of a typical day at her job on the collective farm in the country. Kundera also has a charming way of suddenly reminding the reader that this is only a book, writing that he'll make the name of Tom&aacute;'s son \\"Simon\\" and remembering how he, the writer, first envisioned Tom&aacute;.<br />I also had the fortune of reading this passage on the day the river in the story was making international headlines for flooding Prague and the Czech Republic: \\"She went outside and set off in the direction of the embankment. She wanted to see the Vltava. She wanted to stand on its banks and look long and hard into its waters, because the sight of the flow was soothing and healing. The river flowed from century to century, and human affairs play themselves out on its banks. Play themselves out to be forgotten the next day, while the river flows on.\\"<br />A blurb in the book attributed to the New York Times Book review says \\"With cunning, wit and elegiac sadness, Milan Kundera, the celebrated Czechoslovak &eacute;migr&eacute; writer, expreses the trap the world has become.\\" This is very true. But with Kundera's touch the trap is beautiful, thought-provoking and deeply comforting at the same time. I highly recommend this novel.the trap the world has become.\\" This is very true.

The plot just trips along incessantly. His days are long and filled with absurdity, not a small amount of it of his own making. The writing is very, very clever, and is also loaded with allusions to literature and pop culture that make it a trip to read aloud with another. Sometimes he gets it; sometimes you do.<br />I also found the characters all to be fully developed; as in most good books, the people around the main character, whether he liked them or not were not all good or all evil, and part of the beauty of the book is in \\"Lucky Hank's\\" discovery of this gray area in others.<br />The suffering never seems to end here, but it's not excruciating; it's just kind of touching and funny at times.	2002-08-13

As Friedman always does, he writes in an engagingly personal way that helps the reader understand complex issues. This book is ostensibly about Friedman's time as a foreign correspondent in Beirut and then in Jerusalem in the 1980s, but it's really about the political situation in the Middle East during the time he was there (with helpful, cogent background and history).<br />I really enjoyed this work very much, as I learned SO MUCH about the Middle East, particularly Lebanon/Beirut, that I did not know. It also reminded me of a book I thought was very powerful about Bosnia called \\"Love Thy Neighbor: A Story of War\\" by Peter Maas, who was the stringer for the Washington Post during the war in Bosnia. These books have similar premises: that reporters have more access than the average bear to the politics and tragedies of war and become experts themselves as they learn more and more and witness so many things that don't necessarily make it into their daily stories.<br />This book is divided into three main sections: Beirut, Jerusalem and Washington. The last section deals with Friedman's prognoses for the future of the region and also with his Lexus and Olive Tree theme, which he developed very thoroughly in a book of that name. I thought the Beirut section was the most provocative, but I learned something on every page.<br />The latter chapters in the Jerusalem section dealt with the interesting issues of why Israel gets so much Western press coverage and the relationship between Israeli Jews and the rest of the Jewish people in the Diaspora, particularly in the United States. I was not aware, for example, that at the time Friedman wrote this that there were almost no reform or conservative synagogues or congregations in Israel. Citizens were either secular Jews or Orthodox.<br />[This 570-plus page book has additions since the initial publication in 1989, but the expanded version preceded the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.]<br />Friedman says to gain peace now, no one -- not the Israelis, Jordanians, Syrians, Lebanese, Egyptians or Palestinians -- can focus on their rights or past victimization. Now they must look at what their interests dictate to them in the current climate of opportunities. He says he earned his pessimism about the region the hard way by living through and seeing a great deal of tragedy and cruelty in both Lebanon and Israel (he earned his first Pulitzer Prize writing about the Israeli military role in a refugee camp massacre of Muslims in Lebanon), and that the leaders of those nations will have to earn our optimism the hard way, too, by proving they can lead their people toward a real and lasting peace.<br />I strongly recommend this book.

The piece is not written in a narrative, but is rather more thematically arranged. Wharton doesn't write about the Doges Palace or the Duomo, her milieu is the deeper background of the dedicated traveler.<br />The title comes from her theme derived from an analogy that traveling in Italy involves various areas of a painting. Italian paintings, she writes, have fore- middle- and backgrounds. The two-or three-day tourist in Venice spends all his or her time in the foreground, traipsing the well-established routes and keeping to the guidebooks. If one has more time, one can go farther into the \\"painting\\" by discovering more, and, of course, finally, as Wharton herself has done, one can dwell in the backgrounds, knowing the country well, understanding all its eras and its different brands of beauty.<br />Wharton is a harsh art critic, and much of the book deals with her assessments of lesser known (to me as the foreground tourist of Italy) artists and their works. My favorite chapter retold the story of her identifying some mislabeled statuary in Tuscany as belonging to a different artist and era altogether.<br />It was pleasant to read. For me, I am a fan of Wharton, so enjoyed this look into her experiences and the life of her mind.	2002-07-26

To a one, they advocate investing in those below you, creating leaders in all sectors and at all levels, trusting, collaborating and \\"leading with vision.\\" Some particularly interesting essays were \\"Leading from the Grass Roots\\" by Sally Helgesen, \\"Leadership and Organizational Culture,\\" by Edgar H. Schein, the \\"father\\" of organizational psychology, and \\"The Ultimate Leadership Task: Self-Leadership\\" by Richard L. Leider. In general, the section with essays entitled \\"Learning to Lead for Tomorrow,\\" which was about education and executive training and development was the most engaging for me.<br />I bought this book because I read a very engaging portrait of Marshall Goldsmith in the New Yorker in April, who is a very successful \\"executive coach,\\" helping executives with personal problems in their organizations turn their relationships around. The book overall had a kind of hypnotic effect, as it repeated the same message throughout. Here's a representative excerpt:<br />\\"The challenges ahead will require leaders to identify, promote, reinforce, and live as role models of key core values; inspire diverse groups to common, shared action in which they trade some of their autonomy for a long-term greater common good; and give their best efforts in pursuit of that common good.\\" This is from an essay by George B. Weber who is listed as the secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.<br />It's mildly interesting. I would recommend reading it in bits between other, different books.	2002-07-24

But the end was really the beauty of the book. Before that, I felt a little like I was just speeding along confused about the destination...<br />I didn't think it was as compelling as &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; though there were many similarities that I liked and was drawn to: The relationship between the sister (Franny) and the brother (Zooey) was similar to that between Holden and Phoebe Caulfield, and, of course, the colloquial tone and the means of telling most of the story either through talking or the conceit of talking to the reader was so enjoyable, particularly read aloud. We took a while to get through it though, due to travel schedules, etc., and I think that letting it sit was a mistake; I think it lost some of its intensity because it wasn't read quickly. While reading it aloud was really fun, I think it would be equally enjoyable to hole-up with it for a day or weekend and get the whole effect of the conversations quickly following on one another in &quot;real time,&quot; so to speak.<br />That said, I thought it was really beautiful at the end, and I kind of got a little catch in my throat as I read the  conclusion. Zooey (rhymes with Louie, so I've been told) really loves his sister dearly and her crisis of faith is a crisis for him, too. Its resolution is one of the precious moments when you have a small insight into being really loved. Experiencing that kind of familial closeness was really enriching, I thought. The way Salinger brings it together was quite poetic and moving. I highly recommend it.	2002-07-15

It follows the lives of five expatriates living in the Hungarian capital in 1990 and 1991: John, the mostly main character, who is the \\"disproportionately loathed younger brother\\" of Scott, an English teacher; Mark, who studies the history of nostaligia (!) and whose dissertation was entitled \\"Vacillations of Collective Popular Retrospective Urges in Urban Anglophone Canada, 1980-1998\\"; Charles, nee Karoly, Gabor a Hungarian-American venture capitalist representing his New York firm in trying to find the right way to invest in the new capitalist nation; and Emily, a Nebraska woman working as a glorified intern at the American embassy.<br />The book is largely episodic, though I found myself following an accelerated pace toward the end toward a natural climax and to the I-should-have-known -- but lovely -- falling action. The episodic nature and the way the narrative shifted focus among the five above characters rang true with me, myself a former expat of Prague, 1996-1997. Some of Phillips' observations of this hit home, the sadness when your friends find their time has come to its end and leave, the restless feeling you yourself begin to get when you are tired of hanging out with the same five people all the time.<br />I also found Phillips to have a very keen eye about how the invaders feel about their host people. John, particularly offers interesting views of the Hungarians he meets. One, Nadja, an elderly pianist in a piano bar who tells him many romanticized stories is most certainly a liar, but he loves her dearly. Another, Imre Horvath, a man whose family has owned an important publishing house in Budapest for generations and has certainly lived through enough to warrant his self-awarded stature, is viewed by John and Charles as a joke, a self-important drama king.<br />The book takes a very compelling side trip into the history of the Horvath press, following its owners' and its shared fate from its founding in 1808 to the 1990s when privatization is beginning, a very inventive and engaging way to fill the reader in on the last 200 years of Hungarian history.<br />The narrative zings around a little in time, aside from the focus shifts from character to character, but not too often. Sometimes I thought Phillips was a little too wordy or descriptive, but overall the prose was funny (sometimes laugh-out-loud), cleverly descriptive and memorable.<br />I visited Budapest with four other people in 1996 at the beginning of my time abroad and I did not like the city, or maybe I was just stressed about spending 48 solid hours with people I barely knew, but I did remember very clearly that the Blue Danube was not very blue.

Anastasia divided the royal houses of Europe into definite camps, those for and against, with both sides passionate.<br />All along, Anastasia, as retold by Kurth, reveals compelling knowledge of her identity as the Grand Duchess. She recognizes other European royals by the sound of their voices. She has the exact same foot deformity as the grand duchess, with the same (unusual) color eyes, same height, build and hair color. She knows personal details of life at court that only those there could know.<br />One really fascinating aspect of the book is how Anastasia said she escaped Ekaterinburg after the executions and the scars on her body, which are inline with the bloody end of her family. (She said Grand Duchess Tatiana Nicholaievna fell on top of her, shielding her from fatal wounds, but that she had a bullet wound in her head behind her right ear and she was also stabbed. She was rescued by a Bolshevik soldier who realized that she lived and couldn't bury her, a man named Tschaikovsky. He took her out of Siberia, all the way to Bucharest in a horse cart, where she was briefly married to him and bore a child before Tschaikovsky was shot in a street brawl. She left the infant and Bucharest for Berlin, hoping to find her mother's family. That's where she threw herself in the canal and was institutionalized, and the story began.) She had problems with handwriting after she was found, problems learning how to tell time and she refused to speak Russian for many years, saying it was the last language she heard in Ekaterinburg, but she understood it perfectly, and sometimes uttered phrases of Russian that were definitely idioms that only a native speaker would know.<br />Kurth's retelling of the two trials in Germany to prove her identity are two chapters loaded with convincing information, including a witness who said he saw her alive at Ekaterinburg after the others were shot.<br />But, she was never victorious and, contrary to the film \\"Anastasia\\" with Ingrid Bergman, she never got to meet her grandmother, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (formerly Dagmar of Denmark).<br />A side note that was compelling about this book is how it shows that all those richie-royals in Europe are related to each other. I was very naïve about that and found the realization bizarre.<br />Kurth clearly believed the woman to be Anastasia and in the book, Kurth convinces. I recognize that he's sympathetic to the \\"Anastasians\\" and knew the woman personally, but I have to say, I'm a believer. It's not just that one is sympathetic with \\"the invalid\\" as many referred to her (she wasn't very likeable for long; she was moody and held grudges, was demanding and volatile), but because the evidence of handwriting similarities and physical similarities rather sealed the deal for me.ng to find her mother's family.

The last pages were so incredibly hard to  endure, I really couldnt stand to think about it at all and nuried myself in a magazine article to avoid dwelling on it.<br />The story follows a white, disillusioned South African communications professor, who is fired for harassment. He goes to a rural area of the country to live with his adult daughter, who has a small farm in a volatile region. Shortly after  rriving, they are the victims of terrible violence by three  black men. The professor stays on, but his relationship with his daughter is poor and deteriorates as she refuses to handle the<br />aftermath of the incident as he wishes. At her asking, he helps out at an animal center, where one of his jobs is helping the proprietor put dogs to sleep whom no one wants and then taking their bodies to the incinerator.<br />It doesnt get happier, just sadder. Its overwhelmingly painful. Its very well written and flows well. Coetzee is a  ompelling novelist, but this one was nearly too much to endure. It reminded me somewhat of The Age of Iron, the first one of his I read, which is also about South Africa, ever-present pain of death and the ongoing societal issues of race.	2002-06-18

While Cohen and Prusak do tend to say a lot of things that one has a gut feeling of but has never read or heard someone say aloud about working relationships, some of it was really fascinating. They have a particularly interesting chapter on chat and storytelling and the functions those activities serve at work. The theme of the book is that organizations should invest in social capital the way they invest in other kinds of capital, but that such investments can't be faked. Workers know when the love is real, so to speak.<br />The writers address particularly cogent trends of telecommuting and volatile industries and how those can cause stress in organizations because they lower social capital. They had some interesting points. One thing I particularly responded to was the chapter on trust. They wrote that when someone says their organization is particularly political, what they are saying is<br />that there is very low trust. Another thing they wrote that really interested me is that the virtual office isn't going to succeed - and hasn't as predicted - because work is an inherently social activity. That's one of the reasons people like it and are dedicated to it. Not that many people are ever going to want to work at home in their pajamas - every single day. They also suggest that money isn't the only effective lure for new talent or retainer of current employees. They write that if talent can just be bought, it will be, but if you create high social capital in your organizations, money alone won't be able to suck the talented people from your offices.<br />[The book made me want to read more by Chris Argyris, who is an organizational pyschologist at Harvard, and the book \\"The Social Life of Information.\\"]	2002-06-18

This book created a helpful foundation for understanding our changing planet.<br />The premise on which he bases the book is that there is a conflict in our world between olive trees, which represent our cultural heritage and identity, our spirituality and our rituals, and the Lexus, which is manufactured in technologically advanced factories for people who have cashed in on the globalized American capitalist system and can afford the amenities, and can buy them in increasing outlets worldwide.<br />Friedman makes a convincing case that this current era of Globalization (he suggests that an earlier era in the late 19th and ealier 20th centuries incited the backlashes that we call today Communism, Socialism and Facism) has replaced the former world order created by the Cold War. Then, everything was bipolar, and nations aligned themselves and propped themselves up<br />politically and financially with their alliances to either the Soviet Union or the United States. Now, Friedman states, there is only globalization, or global capitalism, and if your nation isn't plugged into it, your people will suffer.<br />Sometimes the full-bore theme of this book feels heavy, that there is no alternative to market capitalism worldwide seems a little biased, to me. But, Friedman, thankfully, doesn't only concentrate on this, but gives thought, particularly at the end of the book, to the public policies that nations can initiate to protect their olive trees, while not turning their backs on the Lexus.<br />He has some interesting theories, too, that I enjoyed reading about, particularly the idea that no country with a McDonald's franchise has ever attacked another country with a McDonald's franchise. (His first edition came out before NATO v Yugoslavia, but he still stands by it, as NATO isn't a nation...) His<br />idea here is that market capitalism can be a stabilizing force in the world because once people have a big enough middle class to support franchises like McDonald's they are hard pressed to risk their lifestyles for war.<br />I found this edition, which came out in 2000 to be somewhat painful, as his passages about what he calls &quot;super-empowered individuals,&quot; who don't need to be in control of a country or its military to attack other nations or groups, somewhat vaguely but eerily predicted the September 11 plot. His position that the<br />increasing democratization of finance/capital, information and technology can improve life and destabilize it too are convincing, especially in what we've seen happen since the book was published.<br />The book, written in a pleasant, colloquial style with a lot of well-known examples is engaging and easy to read.

It's a masterpiece of writing, in which the author clearly and completely presents to you another person's mind and soul.<br />It is an incredible exercise in empathy. It really was. As I read it, I realized that Holden was far from perfect, but I cared so much what happened to him, I could feel his loneliness and could see him resisting getting the help he needs. Salinger's recreation of a boy headed &quot;to a fall,&quot; as Mr. Antolini tells him, is an amazing opportunity to be someone else for awhile.<br /><br />The colloquial speech of the novel is well suited for reading aloud, and I really enjoyed that aspect of it. I really did. We read it like madmen whenever we could. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />I guess I just want to say that I love and care for Holden Caulfield and I hope, somewhere, he's alright.	2002-06-07

I won this book in a radio contest and read it in two days, as it was pretty light reading and very scanable. The central theme is that &quot;Stepwives,&quot; the term they coined to describe the relationship between women who have been married to the same guy (not at the same time), can get along better if they don't resort to petty, self-involved territorial wars.<br />The authors, two stepwives and a therapist, are good at laying out areas that are common pitfalls for the worst part of one's character when dealing with a husband's ex- or new wife. They spell out well why SHE might not be receptive to you, and the book, I think would help build empathy between women who have consistent and regular contact that is necessitated by caring for the same child.<br />But, while the jacket says that both of you don't have to take part in the program to improve the situation, the improvements would be pretty limited on one's own. Yes, you can make your child more comfortable in your home by not bashing the other woman, being cooperative, setting limits, etc., but really, if the other woman won't participate or be open to your needs and issues, it seems doomed.<br />This book also focuses on stepwives with children at home and wouldn't be helpful to women who deal with adult children.<br />I did think some of the writing was simplistic. For example, the authors give you &quot;feeling words&quot; so you can accurately describe your feelings to yourself or identify issues. Also, I found the authors' PRESCRPTON for successful &quot;comamas&quot; to be a little gimmicky. (It's a &quot;prescription&quot; without the &quot;I&quot; because selfishness has no place in this method.)<br />There is, of course, always something to be said for anything that encourages people to rise above their petty and jealous feelings for the sake of others. That's where this book makes the most impact.	2002-06-07

Our Man in Havana by Graham Greene is a twisted spy tale that skewers the spy genre with humor and Greenes classic ability to demystify through the wry metaphor.<br />James Wormold is the single father of an expensive daughter. When he is accosted by Hawthorne, a British spy in the Caribbean, silence is believed to signify assent when it comes to taking on the spying game. However, Wormold doesnt really spy or recruit agents. He makes up the information he sends to London, and creates agents. For his own and his imagined agents imagined expenses, Wormold collects the money and saves it so that he can afford his own daughter.<br />But something is clearly amiss as Wormold begins to realize that SOMEONE believes his cables to be true. There are mysterious deaths in Havana, and London sends staffers to Wormold to help him manage his cables and his agents.<br />The book is great Greene, with a driving plot, sympathetic yet imperfect characters and vague criticisms of authority and religion. Its a great read altogether.	2002-05-21

She told me that she loved Russian literature and when I asked which novel I should read if I only ever read one, she said, without a doubt, \\"The Idiot.\\" It was her favorite by far.<br />My overwhelming impression after finishing it (just minutes ago) is that I feel that I missed a great deal. A Russian friend of mine told me that it is difficult to start Russian literature with \\"The Idiot\\" because there is a great deal of contextual understanding required for it. This version, translated by Alan Myers and published by Oxford World's Classics in 1992, was quite readable and included explanatory notes on the text at the end, which helped to illustrate some of the incidents to which Dostoevsky refers, including literary references and a famous and gory murder by a person on which a main character in the novel was modeled.<br />(I had to pick it up and put it down a lot, which I'm sure detracted from the pace of the plot for me. It would be more enjoyed if one had a great deal of time to focus on it until it was finished, though I did enjoy it a great deal.)<br />I am told \\"The Idiot\\" is very characterisic of a Russian novel, long, with many characters. It also is overcast with existentialism and hopelessness. I will try to summarize the plot of what is really a very psychological novel. (The big moments are emotional, mostly, and one spends a lot of time thinking about what makes various characters, particularly the rival women, do what they do and say what they say.)<br />Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin is the title character, or the idiot. He has an epilepsy-type disorder, which has caused him to be hospitalized and treated in Switzerland for some years. Returning to St. Petersburg on the train, he is in a car with Parfion Semyonovich Rogozhin and Lukyan Timofeyevich Lebedev, which is where he learns of the beautiful Nastasya Filippovna Barashkova, a kept woman whose beauty is infamous. In order to secure an inheritance, the Prince goes to General Ivan Fedorovich Yepanchin, where he meets Gavrila Ardalionovich Ivolgin, his secretary and the general's daughter, Aglaya Ivanovna Yepanchin, another famous, but chaste and pure (but kind of high maintenance) beauty.<br />The first part of the book is incredibly suspenseful, taking place within perhaps 24 hours or so (I can't quite remember), but I found the rest of the book a little more meandering, though not irritatingly so. There are exciting incidents and a surprising ending, though it was foreshadowed pretty well throughout; I should have seen it or something like it coming.<br />The Prince is clearly meant to be a Christ-like figure. My version of the paperback has a detail of Christ's face from Christ in the Tomb by Hans Holbein on the cover. The Prince is always kind and good, he loves without the strictures of the upper-middle-class society that he sees about him, and even when he's made fun of, tricked, attacked and maligned, he continues to love and care for the social group in which he has found himself.<br />The introductory notes state, \\"Yet if Myshkin is a Christ he is a flawed one, and his mission is doomed to failure. His Christian meekness and compassion ... have disruptive ... consequences when practised in the 'real' world of nineteenth-century Russia. ...<br />[I]n Russia the same qualities [innocence and simplicity] breed mistrust, embarassment, and hatred. ... In Russia Myshkin discovers, for the first time in his life, the gulf between ideals and reality and the impossibility of achieving paradise on earth.\\"<br />Recently, I read a book called \\"If You Want to Write\\" by Brenda Euland, published in the 1930s. She praised the Russian writers because she said they imagined their worlds and characters so clearly and completely that they merely had to write down what they saw and describe it. Their texts did not seem made up, or stilted. I would agree with her. From the first sentence of The Idiot, I could clearly see the world in which Prince Myshkin lived.<br />I also did try to prepare for Dostoevsky himself by reading J.M. Coetzee's fictional work about the return of Dostoevsky to St. Petersburg from Germany when his teen-age stepson died, The Master of Petersburg. I think it was a good preparation for the dark, existential pain of this novel.e it. Their texts did not seem made up, or stilted. I would agree with her.

We've just finished it, and I would say<br />that it's more of an epic tale, the entire saga of a<br />woman's life (and beyond, for it begins before her<br />life on this earth does, and goes into the future, as<br />well). It is the story of Dinah, who is mentioned as<br />the daughter of Jacob in Genesis 34, and the terrible<br />tale of what happens to her contained there is<br />wonderfully retold in The Red Tent.<br />First, I have to say, this is a \\"chick book.\\" The<br />writer is very detailed about the life of women and<br />their bodies, and the book is very focused on the<br />wives of Jacob, and Dinah's part in this as she grows<br />up. But what I found the most interesting about this<br />was that even though Christians and Jews know Jacob in<br />the Bible as a patriarch of their religion, this book,<br />written by a woman who has penned such titles as<br />\\"Choosing a Jewish Life,\\" \\"The New Jewish Baby Book\\"<br />and \\"How to be a Jewish Parent,\\" is not focused on<br />religion or religious feeling. Dinah's mothers (Leah,<br />her biological mother, and the other three wives of<br />Jacob, Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah) worship, some more<br />casually than others, various goddesses. Leah and<br />Rachel's father has family and household gods<br />(mentioned in Genesis), and the supernatural incident<br />of Jacob wrestling with the angel is very gently<br />glossed.<br />I found Diamant's tone to be somewhat distant, and her<br />language a little cold, but by the end of the story, I<br />could see why the writer might have made a conscious<br />choice to do this. It befits an epic, one might say.<br />And her treatment of the event that is told in the<br />Bible about Dinah and her brothers' murders of the<br />Shechemites haunts the rest of the book as one might<br />be traumatized for life after witnessing an atrocity<br />in youth.<br />I should also mention that the book is interesting on<br />an anthropological level, though, I do not know how<br />sure we can be of the accuracy of Diamant's<br />descriptions of life in the Middle East during Old<br />Testament times, but her acknowledgments give credit<br />to scholarly institutions, resources and colleagues. I<br />found this aspect of the book very engaging, and I<br />think it will inform my reading of the Old Testament<br />for some time to come.ng on<BR>an anthropological level, though, I do not know how<BR>sure we can be of the accuracy of Diamant's<BR>descriptions of life in the Middle East during Old<BR>Testament times, but her acknowledgments give credit<BR>to scholarly institutions, resources and colleagues.

Read them for the separate jewels they are. (Erdrich is particularly lovely read aloud, but to read this book aloud, all participants must embrace the feelings of chaos that come early on from the narrative method she employs.)

We, dear readers, never get to know what it contains. This is symbolic because it is really how James has written the whole book; he seems to think it crass to come right out and write anything key to the plot. The result is an opaque style that frustrates rather than engages the reader.<br />I have been a fan in the past and could not put Portrait of a Lady down, but this book was enervating and aggravating. Edith Wharton, a friend of James's and a fan of his, recounts in her autobiography an instance when she was questioning James on a technique that he had used, placing a character in such isolation from the world, so out of touch of others. She elaborated for some time on his technique, then asked him what it was conveying, that he had done this. He replied, hurt, &quot;My dear, I didn't know I had.&quot;<br />This book, perhaps, then is the result of James not knowing that he so obscures events and emotions by his unending examination of the least little thing at the expense of clearly articulating what is actually happening.

The book conveys Bishop Spong's deep spirituality very clearly while also explaining Biblical texts in a way that makes one feel one doesn't have to leave one's brain at home when going to church. I highly recommend this book to people of all religions as a cogent and strong explanation of Christianity today.	2001-12-26

Franken exposes Limbaugh and Gingrich et al. when they misinform their listeners and constituents and pokes fun at political excess on all parts. The book is witty and, may I write, joyfully creative, with funny footnotes as my favorite conceit. The book is a wee bit dated, obviously, as Franken writes himself, a month is an eternity in the political world, but the ideas hold true, and unfortunately, some of the excesses in the right wing are truly timeless.	2001-12-15

While the language can seem a bit dated at times, the meaning shines clearly through; clearly she has taken her own advice or writing truly and focusing on the things one cares about or is passionate about. To read it is almost to become hypnotized by her major themes: you are talented, you have a story or an observation to tell, you can write really well if you are true (not trying to be writerly), you need to enjoy the act of writing and be lazy about it, you need to relax and enjoy the beginnings in hazy territory. This is a good book to read to get you back into old habits, or to help writers re-assess their long-held and perhaps erroneous beliefs about what it actually takes to be a good writer. Ueland excerpts student writing to show examples, and the pieces she uses are very compelling, strong and true. I recommend this to writers and as gifts for writers. But I wouldn't suggest it for someone younger than 25. There is something in it that would be offputting for someone too youthful, too inexperienced.	2001-12-11

The language, which is simple but descriptive, lends itself to myth, making this story the story of boyhoods spent during the Depression. It's an American story, of a man who didn't have much extra in life, but was raised by a compassionate and strong, accomplished mother, and a stern and aloof and hardworking father, told with honesty, not idolatry.<br />There are obviously many levels to this book; it's worth reading, and by the end becomes very personal and provocative.	2001-12-08

This memoir by columnist Gusewelle of the life of his dog Rufus is rich, funny and gives a thorough explication of what it meant to live with the Brittany Rufus. I was not partial to the passages on hunting, as I am not a hunter, but I was still engrossed in the book, because these incidents told a lot about Rufus, and after all, HE loved the hunt. It's a pleasant read, with a not unexpected end that while sad completes the story satisfactorily. If you know someone who loves to read, hunt and loves his dogs, this book is definitely the perfect gift.	2001-12-08

But I have long found Glimmer Train stories disappointing. Too many of them feel &quot;writerly,&quot; as if the writers, and editors, know that they are writing a SHORT STORY. The writing is too self-aware, and many of the stories ring false, with contrived endings and plots, when they exist. I have to admit that I like a limited number of short stories, works by James Joyce and Alice Munro. These don't even come close to those master works.	2001-11-29

It's divided into three sections which focus on Germany, Poland and (then) Czechoslovakia, and focuses not only on the state systems and structures of regimes, spying agencies, etc., but on the individual perspectives and costs. There's a metric ton of reportage packed into the 400-page book, with a very compelling conclusion Rosenberg writes referencing her other work on Latin America. The transition to democracy has not been smooth in any of the countries Rosenberg reports on. Many critics use the word &quot;moral&quot; in praising the book. I think it is, but not in a didactic way. It won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.	2001-11-27

But don't stop there. Purgatory is a beautiful work, illustrating the rise of the human soul through Purgatory's nine ledges. I found it  beautiful how the souls were not hurrying. They waited patiently, yet  eagerly.<br />Musa's translation makes all the difference. The language is  accessible, but not irreverent or vulgar. A routine I found helpful was to  read the introduction to each canto, read the canto, then read all the  notes, checking back to reinforce meanings or double check a name or  place.<br />The Pilgrim's journey through this volume is heavily illustrative  of God's grace, and yet the idea of each person's responsibilities to God  are clear.<br />Don't stop reading after Inferno. These stirring translations  by Musa make it possible to read, understand and love the whole Divine  Comedy.	2000-07-20

Musa's translation communicates the divinity of the events in the story on  an understandable level. The Divine Comedy colored my perception of  religion and helped me to a new understanding of the harmony of  responsibility and grace.

Fielding, using Pride and Prejudice as her  jumping off point, dives head first into the hapless world of young  singleton Bridget and her romance with Mr. Darcy.<br />Fielding brilliantly  skews the values of Bridget from the original Elizabeth Bennet's perfection  and strength. Bridget isn't principled and upright, she's a quivering mass  of hysterically funny insecurities and bad habits like smoking, drinking  and procrastination.<br />Yes, if you're familiar with Pride and Prejudice,  you may see some of the plot points coming from miles away, but if you love  P&amp;P, you'll enjoy this romp. If you've never read Austen's lovely book,  try Bridget first and then get acquainted with Pride and Prejudice. They  make great companions!<br />Bridget promises a laugh a page as well as some  strikingly realistic glimpses of the delicate modern singleton's psyche.  Don't miss this book!	2000-07-07

You'll be disappointed. Try A Prayer for Owen Meany instead.<br />Irving tells his story from such a great distance that  none of his characters are people you can care at all about. The language  is crude and the plot relies so heavily on absurd coincidences, that as I  turned the pages, I became more and more frustrated. It is possible to  create a fantastic ending or story arc if a writer has the right touch with  humor and surprise, but in this work, Irving seems like he's &quot;phoning  it in.&quot;<br />He touches on important issues and there are touching  moments. Some of his narrative devices are effective and compelling, but  overall the book lacks a soul. Skip this and look for John Irving  elsewhere. You won't find him here.	2000-07-07

However, when the children  are returned to their favorite land, they bring along their cousin, the  sour and demanding Eustace Scrubb.<br />Through many adventures at sea and  during ports of call, Eustace makes the rather predictable transformation  into an alright chap, but don't mistake the predictability of this end for  cheap or sloppy story telling on Lewis's part. Eustace's transformation can  be interpreted as the transformation of the unbeliever to a Christian, and  the symbolism of his physical change is rich and compelling for adults and  engaging and magical for children.<br />Our dear, brave friend Reepacheep is  back, too, and shows his continuing bravery in a heartwarming ending that  causes readers to feel great admiration for the little mouse with big  courage.<br />The richest part of the novel is the well described climax in  which the story takes on a mythical nature and our friends come close to  the line between heaven and earth.<br />It's a lovely book, and as usual for  the series, can be enjoyed on theological levels, but it loses nothing if  the reader picks it up as pure fantasy for someone looking for a great  tale!	2000-07-06

The name itself evokessymbols that mean almost as much in our culture as Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow.<br />Reading this book is a lovely gift to make to your children, or to yourself. Lewis draws powerfully on our childhood desire to find ourselves in a fantasy land. The story of Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund being transported into Narnia makes all of think of our own childhoods in a powerful way.<br />And from that power, Lewis can draw on the naivite and newness of children to approach faith and love and the values that accompany them. We see the very basic sin of Edmund as he betrays his siblings for just one more piece of Turkish Delight. And, so movingly, we witness his forgiveness and the love of the Lion for this one boy.<br />Lewis disagreed with the term &quot;allegory&quot; being applied to his Narnia tales. He felt that an allegory provides tangibility to intangible values and he felt his Narnia stories deal with things that are real in our world already. He wanted to show how people might come to God if they didn't have all the baggage and preconception that &quot;our world&quot; loads on top of religious feeling.<br />No matter how much you're reading into this book, it's a piece of magic and not to be missed. Reading it to a child will give it an even stronger place in the life of that person. Not many things mean as much to me as thoughts of the Lantern, Mr. Tumnus, the Stone Table and Lucy. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was read to me as a child and it will always be a dear, dear book to me.	2000-07-06

The text will not set  the standard for the industry, however, so if you are looking for more in  depth reviews of her fashions or her biography, you could make a better  choice.<br />Bottom Line: It's a lovely treat to spend an afternoon with this  book if you're not interested in anything new or innovative.

Of all the Chronicles, I found this to be the least engaging. I found it a small let-down to find myself in Narnia again so far in time from the Pevensies' reigns as Kings and Queens. The plot did not move me along as well as any of the other books in the Chronicles.<br />This is the last book in the Chronicles in which all four of the children are back, and in that way, it provides for a nostalgic return to the Narnia of The Lion... The most interesting aspect was of how the conquering people had come to fear the trees and magic of the land, illustrating how conquerers and empires often despise and oppress what makes a people individual.<br />Bottom Line: This one isn't bad enough to skip over, but it's a bit of a let down after the stellar first volume.	2000-07-06

Bree, a talking horse, wants to return to Narnia. Meeting up with the girl Aravis and the horse Hwin, they travel together, always North, through the requisite quest adventures.<br />The plot seems to be a mix of the Moses story and the  Oedipal story (the latter more vague), with true identities hidden and  prophecies coming true. It also brings to mind A Thousand and One Nights  with its nod to Middle Eastern culture. Also, for those who might be  reading the book for clues and allusions, the deadly sin of Pride plays a  healthy role in the plot of this edition of the series.<br />I found this  volume to be lively and entertaining, full of intrigues and scrapes. The  moral lesson is here, too, and beautifully told. The sin of pride impedes  some of the characters' developments and the reader, whether adult or  child, can see the needless pain and harm it brings to life. The beautiful  and elusive Aslan makes his appearances in just the nick of time, bringing  comfort to the characters as well as to the readers.<br />This story is told  as a myth of Narnia, the folklore and story of a mythical land itself. It  goes a long way to enrich the experience of Narnia and bring another  dimension to the beloved first volume. If you only read one other book  besides &quot;The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,&quot; let it be this  one.	2000-07-03

Sartre addresses a topic the Simone de  Beauvoir does in All Men Are Mortal, what does it mean to be really free?  As the main character Mathieu deliberates on a lifechanging choice, the  scourge of World War II threatens Paris and his way of life. But an inner  battle rages, too (apologies for what may be too heavy-handed of a  metaphor...) and Mathieu realizes a period of his life is coming to an end,  no matter what his choice. The theme Sartre and de Beauvoir have in common?  When men and women are free to make their own choices, we must sit  helplessy by as they often make the wrong, wrong, wrong ones.<br />Sartre and  de Beauvoir both illuminated, to me, the principle that freedom is the  goal. The choices humanity makes using that freedom can be devastating, but  the option to make devastating choices is an irrefutable aspect of life,  and, to my mind, is a very compelling one.<br />I approached this novel by  Sartre, after reading Nausea several years ago with some trepidation, but  with determination after spending a lot of time on de Beauvoir. I enjoyed  this book thoroughly. The story was lifelike with a philosopher's vision  and view, a slight aloofness that gives the reader a window not only to the  life of Mathieu and his circle but also to Sartre's philosophies and  carefully worked out beliefs.	2000-07-03

Each piece plays the right part in the book as  a whole, illustrating what must have been an enchanted time for Cassini. If  one is interested in fashion and its technical aspects, the book's sketches  and interesting details (letters from Jackie about to whom Cassini should  send swatches for hat and glove construction for each dress), his memories  of Jackie along with excerpts of her letters (photographic and in text,  reproduced verbatim) along with the requisite, but lovely photographs of  Jackie is his creations. It brings couture to the United States in a grand  way and makes this French sensibilitiy part of our own Americana.<br />With  all of the Jackie Kennedy products on the market, it was lovely to read  such a heartfelt memoir from the man who helped to position her in our  nation's consciousness as a precious and dear woman.	2000-07-03

Pole and Scrubb are nipped from their alternative school (which Lewis  doesn't let go by without a good ribbing) by Aslan, who sends them forth on  a mission to find the prince. It has the usual quest form of the Narnian  chronicles, two children from our world, helping the Narnians with an  important mission, Aslan's vital intervention and a nod to a deadly sin,  this one is Sloth.<br />I thought the most compelling part of the book was  the beginning when Jill meets Aslan in his land beyond the sea. Having read  of this region of the Narnian world in Voyage of the Dawn Treader, it was  rewarding to get a further view of it.<br />I eagerly read this book to the  end, but I didn't find myself provoked by it as I had been the other  Narnian chronicles. Don't skip it if you want to read them all, choose The  Horse and His Boy and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe if you're only  going to read a few.	2000-07-03

Lewis rejected and resented the word &quot;allegory&quot; being applied to his Narnia series. An allegory, he said, means that abstract principles are brought to life or to concrete form. He felt the entities he  was representing in the Narnia books were real enough already, such as  Christ and God's work in the world.<br />There seem to be many ways to  interpret the books, one book for each of the seven deadly sins, is an  interesting way to look at the volumes of the series, for example. It's  also interesting when one thinks of Lewis's idea that humans no longer come  to God without preconceived notions of what it will feel like to love God.  Lewis felt that people lack a freedom to love God in their own ways as  there is so much &quot;baggage&quot; attached to religious feeling anymore.  He wanted to write about these children's reactions to Aslan in a way that  would illustrate a true and unencumbered love of God.<br />But, even beyond  these things, and the temptations to identify philosophical tenants such as  the Devil's rights theory, and so on, the stories themselves are truly  enjoyable narratives that sweep one up and away. Though other writers, such  as Tolkien, criticized the heavy-handedness of the ending of  &quot;Lion,&quot; the plots are true and engaging. A favorite of mine is  the Horse and his Boy, which seems to be a Moses-meets-Oedipus story.<br />For children, these narratives are riveting. For adults they provide a  lot of grist for the intellectual mill. They're timeless, and it's hard to  believe they'll become anything but a greater and greater part of our  cultural identity as the years pass.	2000-06-14

We wonder what it is that has  hurt her, but there is nothing cheap or conveniently resolvable about this  book, which deepens its impact and makes it seem that much more real.<br />The  narrator writes of her life in Italy, while remembering her past with an  aloof distance. She has what could be rich relationships with a  neighborwoman and her family and with an American she meets abroad. But  there is a reason she is living away from home (in Ireland), and the light  and stone of the title come to embody her memories.<br />It's a brilliant work  and highly recommended.	2000-06-14

The text was a little too  hyperbolic in deifying Diana, yet perhaps that is appropriate, as few have  done so much for fashion in our century.<br />But this book has redeeming  qualities that make it worth the time. First, it does cite instances of  Diana's fashion faux pas that are gossipy and interesting, for example her  dressing-gown dress by David Sassoon and her slip-style dress by John  Galiano for Dior. It is also quite meticulous about citing designers and  recounting their memories of dressing Di. This humanizes a commercial name  and gives the reader a sense of what her patronage meant to these fashion  houses.<br />The best aspects of the book are the appendices listing the  auction catalog by piece and the designer listing with short biographies.  This is a wealth of specific information that couture-ophiles will love.	1999-08-27

When one remembers watching the Panorama interview on network television and then reads Bedell Smith's take on it, the phrases &quot;she won't go quietly,&quot; etc., that Diana used to describe her persecuted state take on another meaning.<br />Having known people with this personality disorder, I can personally attest that it can be baffling and frightful -- the lengths they may go to make a point or effect an outcome they desire. Bedell Smith portrays Diana in a manner consistent with what I've seen personally, the paranoia, the secrecy, the manipulation and the lack of self-worth that accompany this personality disorder.<br />I found the strongest aspect of the book was the means by which Bedell Smith made her case: she consistently gave examples of Diana's behavior and kept relating it back to the fact that the princess wasn't learning from life's lessons. For example, she constantly stated that she listened to no one as her instincts were strong enough to guide her flawlessly, and yet, she almost always came to regret things she did that were guided by these instincts, like cooperating with Andrew Morton for his books, and the Panorama interview, which essentially ended her marriage.<br />Bedell Smith also casts Diana's charitable activities in a more realistic light. She writes of the princess's inconsistent commitments, her inability to maintain any kind of substantive planning capacity with the Red Cross, and how she left some commitments hanging while picking up new ones, for fey reasons. Though she was repeatedly and consistently offered the option of forwarding some kind of official ambassador position, she was unable to persist in the planning, and then liked to throw blame for it never happening on the palace.<br />The overwhelming feeling one takes away is that Diana Spencer/Diana, Princess of Wales, had such opportunities and such a wealth of possibility in her life, and yet her serious lack of a sense of self precluded her optimizing and enjoying the sweet and precious aspects of her life -- any except her children. I have always been taken with and charmed by Diana, and I still enjoy reading of her life, but this book convinces me of something: Diana was likely so easy for us to love because her lack of her own personality allowed us to thrust our own upon her. And then we like what we see before us.r happening on the palace.<br />The overwhelming feeling one takes away is that Diana Spencer/Diana, Princess of Wales, had such opportunities and such a wealth of possibility in her life, and yet her serious lack of a sense of self precluded her optimizing and enjoying the sweet and precious aspects of her life -- any except her children.

Frank McCourt strikes just the right timbre for a memoir of such misery. There is a matter-of-fact tone to the book that resonates and stays with you and in your consciousness when you're not turning the pages eagerly for  the next Limerick adventure. There are plenty of tragedies in McCourt's  young life, but the distance and stoicism with which he tells the story  allows a deeper involvement by the reader than one would allow oneself if  the tone were outright maudlin or weepy. There's a humor here and an  acceptance that is admirable and that also contribute to hope. It's a  compelling story and a compelling life and I strongly recommend it.	1999-08-16

Lucy and her cousin Charlotte are offered rooms with a view of Florence by a Mr. Emerson  and his son, who are willing to exchange. The strict and pinched Miss  Bartlett does not wish to have an obligation to the Emersons, who are  deemed less than polite society will condone. Their rector, Mr. Beebe,  tells them he believes the exchange is proper and the ladies get their view  of Florence. It becomes clear that Lucy herself wants a view of LIFE and  later confesses to her fiance, a priggy intellectual, that she imagines him  always in a room with no windows, with no view. The novel's love story is  compelling, but the secondary themes of class and society structures are  equally strong, with the truly noble characters emerging in the end with  great strength.	1999-08-02

This book was an excellent introduction to some very helpful themes in marketing, such as that all of it is all about sales! After reading Zyman's treatise, I feel  ready to be effective and not emotional about my tactics. It was easy to  read and accessible to the neophyte. I highly recommend it and keep it  handy at work. It's a great resource. I was a little distracted by some of  the typographical errors that made it to the printed copy. I think the  quality of the printing undermined Mr. Zyman's hard work and excellent  message.	1999-07-27

The characters are compelling and touching and the perpetrator of  the crime is understood by the Benedictine monks, and, thus, the reader.  It's the mystery that sucks you in, but it's the character development and  the way the author tells of Medieval life that are the value here, I think.  At the end, I teared up a bit. I'm anxious to read more about Brother  Cadfael and his colleagues!	1999-07-12

I wanted to read it as a companion to  de Beauvoir's autobiographical series and was particularly grateful to Bair  for pointing out incidents in which de Beauvoir &quot;guilded the  lily&quot; when she recounted her own life. De Beauvoir's autobiography and  this make perfect companions for a study on auto/biography and its  subjectivication. (Also see Silent Woman by Janet Malcom.)<br />I had read  previous biographical material on de Beauvoir, but none I ever felt was so  complete, and helped me to know her so well. I strongly recommend this as  history, literary criticism, psychology and philosophy.	1999-07-12
US	52928260	RKBE9J6IR3SHC	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Mesmerizing	Lolita, like Pale Fire, subtly and irresistibly lures the reader into the mind and world view of an unreliable but savvy narrator, while giving a kind of \\"rescue-me\\" code to the reader from the author's view of the book's  events. Lolita, while on surface irritatingly demanding and bratty, becomes  beloved and tragic and Humbert Humbert declines into his own pool of excuse  and rationalizing. A dreamlike book one can't leave, even after it's  finished and it rests back on the shelf.	1999-04-27

Her historical treatment provides the backdrop I would  guess many people lack in drawing conclusions about contemporary first  ladies, and this background is, and always would be, cogent.<br />I remember  (with some regret) as a child remarking to my mother during the 1980  elections that Nancy Reagan was prettier than Rosalyn Carter. My mother  replied, \\"Well, Reagan was a movie star! Don't draw your conclusions based  on how they LOOK...\\" Now, 19 years later, I get the facts to back up my  mother's admonition.<br />The book is only a gloss, not an in depth treatment,  and Caroli states she's not trying to draw wide-ranging conclusions. The  strength of the book comes in her setting forward a small written portrait  of each woman and her times, giving the reader a good spring board for  further study in areas of interest.<br />A favorite account was of Betty  Ford's candor and refreshing attitude with the press. Through this book I  developed a real interest in her and the work she did during her time in  office. Even democratic friends say they remember her time in the White  House as good years for the \\"office\\" of first lady.	1999-04-26

Her chapters on her  friends and family and work connections step over the line of good taste  into name-dropping, and make a middle-class reader who lacks such  connections and priveleged upbringing almost bitter.<br />The most  dissatisfying aspect of the book, however, is how Roberts teases the reader  with tidbits of her life, but keeps the door shut on the substantive  personal information, as if she writes from a great distance about her  subject and is unwilling for the reader to really know her. Perhaps this is  an occupational hazard for a really good journalist-- perpetual self  effacement-- but it weakens the effectivenss of the book.<br />Most damning is  her cliched rendering of her marriage and family life. She glosses  difficult passages and frustrations to the point where the reader feels  less than a woman unless she has the same kind of \\"storybook\\"  life.<br />Roberts' focus was lost in trite pleasantries. The real  contribution would have been a more indepth look at her life and family.  Too bad she missed her chance.	1999-04-23

Her narrative illustrations of the assasination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and the attentat that killed King Alexander and Queen Draga in Belgrade are some of the most amazing prose written, whether you view her version as fact or fiction or somewhere in between.<br />West is a marvelous storyteller, especially when the story  -- in some form -- took place, making this worth a look, even if it's only to read through sections of specific interest.	1997-10-20
