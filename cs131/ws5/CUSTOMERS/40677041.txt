I have read several of this author's books and they are extremely well-written. This book is definitely no exception. Although, as can be expected, the author focuses on witches and witch hunts mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there is a chapter covering the mid-twentieth century Nazi period. As usual, the writing is clear, engaging, breathlessly exciting in places and occasionally tongue-in-cheek in the way certain things and events are described. This makes this masterpiece very difficult to put down. The descriptions given of the methods used to torture supposed witches, and their effects on the human body, are very graphic; so, no punches are pulled, as it were. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in this dark chapter in human history, or even in history in general, as told by a master raconteur.	2005-10-13

Finally, when I more seriously considered taking the plunge, I quickly realized that there was a great deal that I didn't know about the variety of observing equipment that's out there, how it works, the pros and cons of each design, how to use it, accessories, prices, etc. I needed a guide that would answer all of my questions in a manner that is clear, simple, short and to the point. This little book (128 pages) seemed to be exactly what I needed, so I bought it. I was not disappointed. Everything seems to be covered, from different telescope optical designs, types of mounts, variety of accessories, etc., to associated software packages and useful publications. Throughout the book, the reader's budget is kept in mind - prices are indicated to give the reader some perspective. The text is very clear and concise and many figures and photos complement it very nicely. I recommend this book to anyone who, like me, wants to gain basic knowledge of the equipment that is out there for  use in amateur astronomy - knowledge that could be most useful in making an informed decision as to which equipment to purchase.	2005-09-20

The question that then arises is: What if I invest in a decent telescope, use it a few times to examine some of the celestial bodies, then eventually get bored for lack of knowing what to look at or to look for? This book attempts to help potential amateur astronomers dance around this sticking point. The author discusses the current activities of some professional but mainly amateur astronomers: what they look for, the equipment that they use, what they've found and what they continue to find. The book is well written and fun to read; it covers most areas of interest in astronomy and briefly describes what's out there. The book's only shortcoming is that it contains no figures, pictures or diagrams of any kind (other than star charts in the appendices); this is unfortunate since a few optical diagrams and pictures of the various items and people that are discussed would have complemented the text very nicely. Nevertheless, this is a great book that does much to encourage amateur astronomy. I heartily recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the night sky.	2005-09-16

The author, an astronomer and world class expert in his subject matter, is also a very witty, occasionally humorous and most engaging writer. The historical presentation and mini-biographical snippets are very well written and most informative. As a welcome bonus, the author has included some technical details on the optics and designs of telescopes of all types; the many optical diagrams nicely complement the physical descriptions given in the text. Of course, these physical descriptions encouraged me to dig up my old optics textbooks to verify some of the technical arguments for myself. A glossary, notes and a list of references round out this excellent book. This is a valuable addition to the library of any science buff and is indispensable to anyone remotely interested in astronomy and its fascinating tools.	2005-09-02

This book also includes several examples on the different uses of a GPS, i.e., different circumstances. These examples will likely prove more useful to me when I actually have a GPS in my possession to play with. I believe that the less knowledgeable a person is in this field, the more useful this book will be. The writing is clear and the information is well presented.	2005-08-19

The main focus is the development of electrical science, technology and even related showmanship during the 19th century. Technical details are omitted in favor of a well-balanced digression on the related historical and social issues of that period. Although many individuals clearly play important roles in this saga, Michael Faraday is the principal character around which the developments in this important field unfold. This book is very well written in an elegant style. It will be of interest to history buffs as well as those interested in the history of science.	2005-08-17

I believe that the author has done an excellent job in detailing DST's evolution, often in excruciating detail, right up to the current, yet still fluctuating, situation. The writing is clear and engaging making the book very easy to read. The book also contains many caricatures that were published over the years clearly expressing people's views on this most contentious issue. I highly recommended this book to anyone, especially those interested in recent history. The fact that this subject has recently made the news makes this book very timely.	2005-08-12

This excellent book certainly contains what one would expect in a book on forensic science - primarily the identification of the remains of recently (and not so recently) deceased individuals. The book is centered on the life of forensic anthropologist Dr. Doug Owsley and includes what are probably some of his more exciting cases. About two-thirds of this book is about a legal battle pitting Dr. Owsley and a team of like-minded scientists (represented by a devoted pair of first class lawyers) against the U.S. government regarding the right of the scientists to study an ancient 9800 year old skeleton recently found near Kennewick, Washington, instead of immediately giving it to local Native American tribes for reburial; the skeleton - dubbed Kennewick Man - was found to be anthropologically inconsistent with Native Americans. The book is very well written, exciting and difficult to put down. It would be of interest to forensic science buffs as well as those with an interest in legal issues and how they may be resolved. Highly recommended!	2005-08-09

Over the years, I have read a great many books on forensic science and this one is clearly one of the very best. The writing style is so engaging that the book is almost impossible to put down. The text is clear and flows by itself; any technical terms that are used are fully explained the first time that they are used; forensic science techniques and various processes, such as what happens to a body after death, are explained as the need arises, depending on the nature of the cases being discussed. Fortunately, each chapter presents a different case; this provides the reader with the opportunity to catch his/her breath and take a break before plunging into the next one. This book will be of great interest, not only to forensic science buffs, but also to anyone interested in thrilling crime stories. Highly recommended!	2005-08-02

I have a passion for forensic science books. Although this book is well written, what takes away the joy of reading it is the author's tremendous ego. That really annoyed me. At the end of the book, the reader can do nothing other than exclaim (facetiously, of course): Wow! What would the world ever do without Emily Craig?! I fully agree with the prior reviewer who was rightfully more critical of the Craig ego than I am here; thus, I will not bother repeating those valid comments. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book when there are so many more objective and exciting forensic science books out there written by true experts who are not afraid to give credit where it is due. I rarely give a book such a low rating, but in this case, it is the author's inflated ego that has earned it and not the material that the book covers.	2005-08-02

Included are discussions on Rome as a city, the Roman Empire, the military, politics, religion, social life, attitudes towards sex, people's lodgings, food, clothing, class differences, women's roles in society, etc. Of course, Hadrian himself figures quite prominently, as do, to some degree, his immediate predecessors and successors. The authors have done an excellent job of presenting as full a picture as possible of that period in Roman history. The writing is generally clear and accessible, although the reader's interest in the text may vary depending on the specific topic under discussion. This is a valuable addition to the literature on Ancient Rome.	2005-07-27

The various types of rocks and their origin and evolution are indeed discussed early in the book; however, other topics that are discussed to varying degrees include the formation of the solar system and the earth, the evolution and structure of the earth and the atmosphere, the evolution of life, mass extinctions, ocean currents, ice ages, etc. As a result, the book's subtitle \\"The Autobiography of the Earth\\" is quite appropriate. This book is well written and should be read by a wide audience, including geology buffs since there are many details given that one does not often find in books aimed at a completely lay audience. The only drawback is that there are no drawings or pictures of any kind; these would have nicely complemented the text. Nevertheless, this is a good authoritative book, engagingly written and highly recommended.	2005-07-15

In this book, as in its predecessor (Damned Lies and Statistics, 2001), the author warns against believing as facts the statistical figures that are always presented to us from various sources - both authoritative and otherwise. The solution is to be critical and to ask questions such as: Who produced those numbers? Exactly what was counted? What are those numbers really saying?  Is there a way to present the information in a clearer more objective way? At the end, the author strongly argues in favor of the development of some system in society that would impart, what he calls, statistical literacy in the population at large. The book is clear and well written; it should be widely read.	2005-07-08

The author discusses ancient Greek history and archaeology through the work of two famous pioneers in this field: Heinrich Schliemann and Sir Arthur Evans. The main sites focused upon are Troy, Mycenae and Knossos; however, many more sites are discussed, both in Crete and mainland Greece. This is obviously a work of love for the author; the passion with which he writes about this subject is spellbinding. Although written in 1953 (revised in, probably, the late 1950s - this isn't clear), the historical facts surrounding the principal personages remain valid; only the interpretations of the findings (and those unearthed since then) have evolved. I heartily recommend this book to anyone with an interest in truly ancient (pre-classical) Greece and in the pioneers who led its discovery and excavation.	2005-06-28

There are many details about the many substances that were used to treat a variety of medical conditions, as well as how these were to be taken or applied. In view of this, and the fact that both authors are physicians, perhaps all that is missing from this book are comments from the authors on the current thinking about the expected effectiveness (or lack thereof) of these many substances in treating the conditions for which they were prescribed. Complete with beautiful color pictures and written in a very clear style, I believe that this work would be a valuable addition to any library on ancient Egypt.	2005-06-23

The sources of the information presented are clearly stated as are the shortcomings of those sources. The author writes clearly and much of the text is very detailed. A reader expecting to read about details in the life of Boudicca will be disappointed. However, a reader seriously interested in history and archaeology will find much valuable information here.

This is a truly wonderful book; it spans Richard Feynman's life, from a more intimate perspective, from a young man until his death at age 69. There are so many letters to and from Richard Feynman on such varied topics that the reader can gain tremendous insight on the way in which this remarkable human being thought and felt about science, nature, life, people and the world. Some parts did bring tears to my eyes, while others had me laughing out loud. I've read all of the popular books on or by Richard Feynman and this one is a wonderful complement. No Feynman library can be complete without this valuable book. His daughter Michelle should be proud to have done such a remarkable job of putting this book together.

Political shenanigans such as speech making, philosophizing, calculating, popularizing, strategizing, plotting, bullying, terrorizing, assassinating, etc., etc., comprise the main bulk of this tome. Unfortunately, great military campaigns are only briefly glossed over in comparison. The author concentrates on the later part the Roman Republic period - between about 90 BC to about 30 BC. This book certainly opens ones eyes to public life in Ancient Rome; the value of (generally loveless) marriages, alliances, family history and personal talent (or shortcomings) of different sorts in furthering (or hindering) a politician's career in that remarkable period are explored to the fullest. The writing is clear and engaging. My only beef is that the book could have been more balanced by including many more details on the military campaigns and the battles that contributed in an important way to Rome's greatness; this at the expense of some of the political details.	2005-05-27

He claims to be objective in examining and assigning likelihood to each cause without taking any sides when there could be sides to take, e.g., what killed off the dinosaurs; however, he is clearly not convinced that K-T mass extinction was due mainly to a comet or asteroid impact and is at odds with other researchers in this regard. This book is not quite what I expected. It is quite technical and detailed and worthy to be read, perhaps more by specialists or those very well versed in this field than by general readers. I am a physicist who likes to include books on geology and mass extinctions on his reading list; however, this a book that I would need to read again, and slowly, to get the most out of it. In a first read, I felt that I could not see the forest for the trees - that's how detailed it is.

The author, a physician specializing in infection disease, has done an excellent job in describing the various hazards of being bitten or stung. She discusses the \\"dangerous\\" creatures themselves, the biological effects on humans of their bites, stings, etc., and, most importantly, several real life cases - these add a powerful element of reality to the potential dangers involved.

Theories abound, from the plausible, i.e., a comet or asteroid, to the absurd, e.g., an alien spaceship.

The author starts off with a discussion on how numbers began to be used to describe physical items. Eventually, the discussion focuses mainly on the evolution of the use of numbers in the social sciences - hence, the birth of statistics. The book contains some fascinating information on how social statistics evolved, with an entire chapter devoted to Florence Nightingale. It should be emphasized that the focus is mainly on how numbers came to be used and not necessarily on the actual results obtained; thus, if the reader is expecting to see a discussion of the results, he or she may be disappointed at times. But this is a minor shortcoming. The book is well-written and clear.

With these modern methods ingrained in our minds, we can only gasp when we read about the methods used in the nineteenth century and earlier. I have read a number of books by this author and this is one of his best. He describes how antiquities were treated in the past - where being a tomb robber in Egypt was reputable and the source of much income for individuals and museums outside of Egypt. The discovery of ancient monuments and artifacts was encouraged by those in power in Egypt only so that they could be presented as gifts to potential allies. Despite this \\"rape of the Nile\\" that has so tragically taken place on such a large scale in the past, it encouraging to read Dr. Zahi Hawass's comment that only about 30% Egypt's antiquities have been discovered thus far.

If there is a shortcoming to this book, it is simply the fact that there is some amount of repetition of facts, often on the same page.

In pre-modern times, educated people thought very seriously about such things that today most of us would consider absurd, e.g.., werewolves, witches, walking dead, etc. Also, in those olden times, people thought rather differently about God, angels, saints, demons, demonic possessions and the devil than most of us do today. Intelligent, educated thinkers of pre-modern times had a way of looking at things that may seem strange to us yet were perfectly in line with their times. The logical arguments that they used to address their contemporary problems had common sense structure - only their starting assumptions were vastly different from those we would use today. One can only guess at what humans living, say, a thousand years from now will think about our own ways of viewing the world. Through discussing specific cases and quoting contemporary writers, the author of this excellent book does a commendable job of illustrating the above. This book is hard to put down and I heartily recommend it.	2005-03-23

I would therefore agree with prior reviews who have made similar comments on this otherwise interesting book.	2004-05-26

The math is mostly high school level with a small dash of calculus in a few cases. The text is clear and engaging and complements the calculations very well. The reason that I am giving it four stars instead of five is that there are several typos in the calculations and the units are not always carried through, i.e., numbers are often presented dimensionless when they are not.

Since I've been working in the nuclear field as a radiation dosimetry specialist for almost 30 years now, I couldn't help but to wonder what this young man could have done to be the subject of a book with such a title. So, I bought the book out of curiosity and read it with intense fascination. It became clear to me that this young man is gifted; and if his efforts could be properly focused, he could do great things. The book is a page turner. It is well written and in an engaging style. The author weaves a truly riveting story - and a true one on top of that. Unfortunately, the book has two shortcomings, i.e., the reasons for four stars instead of five. First of all, there are technical errors; here are only two examples: Roentgen discovered x rays in 1895 and not in 1896 as indicated on page 30; also, and more importantly, the statement on page 159 that beta particles from tritium can penetrate one or two centimeters of human flesh is grossly incorrect. In fact, the most energetic beta particles emitted by the tritium nucleus cannot even penetrate the skin's dead cell layer on the outer surface of the skin - they are simply not fast enough to give a radiation dose even to the skin, let alone deeper human flesh. The second shortcoming is the book's anti-nuke flavor. Tongue-in-cheek statements that tend to put into question the competence of engineers and scientists who are trying to improve the human condition should be replaced by statements that put as much emphasis on the successes and breakthroughs, as on the errors and misjudgments; otherwise a very misleading, erroneous and biased impression may be acquired by those simply wishing to learn the facts. At any rate, it is not my intent to belabor these points. This book presents a truly exciting story and will not disappoint; but by no means should it be used as an accurate historical or technical reference in nuclear science.	2004-03-15

This is a book about an important topic in our lives: electrical power. Although the author discusses early discoveries in electricity, the main focus is on the period from the late 1800s to the early 1900s - a period when great advances were made in the development of large scale electrical power generation, as well as on the giants who led the way. The science is discussed, at least to some degree, as are the economics of the time. Mini biographies of Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla are also presented. The writing is clear and engaging such that the book is difficult to put down. My only disappointment was that, in my opinion, the science and engineering aspects were not discussed enough; I think that an appendix with more scientific details would have complemented the book very well. But despite this minor shortcoming, the book certainly succeeds in giving the reader a flavor of those exciting times. Highly recommended!	2004-03-03

In addition to containing scientific discussions on this event and life on earth before and after it, the book is written in the form of a personal memoir spanning the years from 1991 to 2003. Included are detailed descriptions of what paleontological field work can be like, various thoughts rambling through the author's mind on various subjects, miscellaneous personal experiences (some related and some unrelated to the main theme), interactions with scientific colleagues and the agony and the ecstasy of scientific work. To those familiar with this author's prior books (which are excellent, I might add), this one will stand out as different because of the above and its unexpected meanderings, although still keeping track of the main theme, at least in the general sense. The reason for selecting &quot;Gorgon&quot; as the book's title is unclear to me in view of its content. Although not quite what I expected, I did find the book well-written and enjoyable.	2004-02-11

But after examining the reviews more carefully, I noticed that several of the reviewers giving the book a low rating did admit to the fact that the book contained interesting information. So, after browsing it yet again, I bought it and read it. I was not disappointed. The author's writing style is very cultured but, at times, awkward; so, for me, it is not what I would call a quick read. There is much on Poincare, less on Einstein, much on simultaneity, some physics history and much on time synchronization, from all angles: political, cultural, scientific and technological. Although the book does seem to wander from one subject to a seemingly unrelated other, from one person to another and from one continent to another, everything eventually comes together. I enjoyed this book and recommend it. It should be read while keeping an open mind.	2004-02-04

Anyway, this book contains a nearly homogeneous mixture of essentially two seemingly unrelated subjects: (i) traveling within Russia and (ii) information on meteorites. The first is presented as a travelogue; it includes all sorts of little details on travel problems encountered in Russia (political and otherwise), food eaten, people encountered, etc. Interspersed with this, in each chapter, is fascinating information on meteorites, i.e., their origins, types, composition, behavior upon entering the earth's atmosphere and upon impacting the ground, etc. Each chapter addresses a specific meteorite site that was visited by the author, with the exception of the last chapter which is about comets and asteroids that are out in space and that may or may not pose a threat to life (or some of it) on earth. The book is well written and should be of interest to those planning to travel within Russia, as well as those interested in meteorites; and, of course, those interested in both. I gave the book four stars instead of five because, to me, the two subject areas, which may be worth five stars each, detract from each other. For me, the parts about meteorites per se, were great (five stars); but I found the travel information rather cumbersome - hence an overall four stars.	2004-01-26

This book is certainly no exception. Using up-to-date information, the authors discuss the evolution of life on earth as a function of evolving environmental, geological and astrophysical conditions. Then, they project the further evolution of these conditions into the distant future - from climate changes and future ice ages to the sun's transformation into a white dwarf - and discuss the anticipated effects on all forms of life on earth and on the earth itself. The book's only possible shortcoming that I can think of is that, in these forecasts, not enough credit has been given to the human element. Humans are well known to have the ability to modify their environment to their satisfaction. Based on the tremendous advances in science and technology over the past few centuries, one would expect a (possibly exponential) continuation of these advances well into the next few centuries, if not millennia - assuming, of course, there are no major setbacks. Consequently, humans may be able to delay, or prevent, at least some of the anticipated catastrophes. As is usual in Ward's books, the writing is clear, authoritative, friendly and engaging. An excellent read! The ultimate fate of humanity, as painted by the authors, does indeed look rather grim; but time will tell how well humanity makes out. Fortunately, we, as individuals, will not be here to find out.	2004-01-23

The target audience for this book is unclear to me. There is something of interest here for psychologists, artists, art historians, science historians, classical historians and perhaps others. As a professional scientist, I mainly enjoyed the few sections dealing with the history of astronomy. Although the writing is generally clear, the style could be more engaging. Is this because the original Italian text was like that, or did it lose its spark while being translated into English (?) I suspect that the latter is more likely. Anyway, because the book contains such a hodge-podge of information, all centering around shadows, at least parts of it should be of interest to almost anyone; I'm giving it as much as four stars mainly because of this.	2004-01-12

Although this book's principle character is the author, there are many interesting snippets from the last few years of Feynman's life. This is a very pleasant book. In addition to containing painless discussions on the work of theoretical physicists, it shows that even the greatest scientific giants have their weak points that make them as human as the rest of us. The book is very well written and in an engaging style that makes it difficult to put down. There are a few lessons in there for all of us.	2004-01-07

The writing is very clear and often witty. Unfortunately, some of the subject matter and its presentation is rather boring and, from my perspective anyway, uninteresting. These boring runs are interspersed with quite interesting ones as well as useful historical digressions. In view of the diversity of the items discussed, I suspect that parts that I found boring will be found interesting by other readers, and vice versa.

They guide the reader through various physical concepts using simple calculations, often to arrive at interesting conclusions. The author of this book has attempted to do this in an accessible way while mixing in historical snippets to add to ones reading pleasure. Unfortunately, I must agree with the prior reviewer who commented on the fact that the book was very poorly edited. There are, indeed, too many errors and typos, especially in the equations, and many explanations lack the clarity and completeness that one would expect in such a book - things that may discourage neophytes and induce feelings of impatience and mistrust in the minds of the initiated. But because of the interesting topics discussed, a thorough, proper and careful revision of this book, including careful re-thinking and re-writing of some of the discussions would easily make it five-star material. Such a revised version would be an asset to popular science literature.	2003-12-18

Starting from ancient thought about the perceived workings of the universe and the fundamental building blocks of matter, the author highlights the progress that was made throughout the ages eventually culminating in the current status of a Theory of Everything.

In short, this excellent book is most accessible and can be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in science.	2003-11-28

But since I had heard good comments about it, I bought it anyway. I'm very glad that I did! I learned a lot from it. The lack of figures is compensated for by the author's excellent ability to clearly describe what a figure would have illustrated. The analogies used are well selected and are most helpful; the reader gets a good idea of how materials behave under various conditions at the atomic/molecular level. On the negative side, however, there are a couple of problems. On page 130, it is pointed out that a moon loses angular velocity over time due to its collisions with particles in space such that a collision between the moon and the surface of the planet that it's orbiting will ultimately result. This is misleading because our moon is actually receding from the earth. The reason for this is well described in the book &quot;The Big Splat&quot; (by D. Mackenzie). Another problem is that on page 131, it is stated that the Newton (N) is a unit of momentum. This is incorrect. The Newton is a unit of force in the MKS system. Since momentum is mass multiplied by velocity, its units in the MKS system are kg-m/s. Since the Newton is a unit of force, its subunits are kg-m/s2. Thus momentum can be expressed in kg-m/s or in N-s. Anyway, despite these minor shortcomings, the book is excellent and, I believe, well worth the five stars that I have given it. I heartily recommend it.	2003-11-17

Not only did they need to dodge flying arrows and swinging swords, but they had to contend with the possibility that a mere scratch from either could be fatal, as could the consumption of local water, wine, food, etc. The author's knowledge of the field stands out as she describes the uses of these &quot;unconventional&quot; weapons in various engagements and the agonizing effects on their unfortunate victims. In addition, the author often compares the uses of ancient biological and chemical weapons to the current uses of modern equivalents.

But this book contains much more than a detailed educated reconstruction of that battle in all of its gory details; the author builds up to the battle by going back many years to show the evolution of the relationships between the Roman Empire and its neighboring peoples. The daily life of ancient Romans is discussed as well as that of the ancient Germans, in addition to their comparative ways of thinking, fighting, technology, etc. The pertinent highlights of the lives of Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, Arminius and other key historical figures are also well presented. The immediate aftermath of the battle is discussed, as are the effects on subsequent Roman-German relationships. The author writes very clearly, authoritatively and in a very engaging style which makes the information presented most accessible to the general reader. The book does contain a certain amount of repetition, as pointed out by a prior reviewer; however, in my opinion, this does not take away from the book's qualities. This is a valuable addition to the popular literature on the ancient world. A real page-turner that is highly recommended!	2003-10-31

Although some stellar/space science is briefly discussed, the main theme of the book is centered on sociological hardships, financial losses, research budgets, business interests, etc., all pertaining to our periodically stormy sun. Especially highlighted are: the survival of expensive satellites in space during less than ideal space weather, the sociological effects of their loss and the effects of this weather on power grids on earth. But my unfulfilled expectations and resulting disappointment should not result in a poor rating for this book. It is well written, very informative and seems to thoroughly cover, I think, what it was apparently intended to cover - hence my rating of 4 stars.	2003-10-23

In addition to being very clearly written in a very engaging style, the author discusses just about all aspects of the development and use of the electric chair: technology of the times, effects of electricity on the human body, legal and political aspects of executing condemned criminals using electricity, related sociological matters, even the life, trial and details of the execution of the chair's first official customer. Naturally, the war between Edison and Westinghouse, i.e., DC vs AC, plays a most prominent role in this exciting saga; in particular, the &quot;efforts&quot; in determining which is deadlier: DC or AC. Highly recommended!	2003-09-11

In the first half of the book, the author discusses early predictions of the existence of CMB, its eventual discovery and interpretation as well as attempts at measuring its structure, in particular, the cosmic background explorer (COBE) mission. The second half of the book concentrates on the microwave anisotropy probe (MAP) project which also attempts to measure the CMB structure but with much greater resolution that COBE. The human aspects of the story are also well covered, clearly indicating that scientists, too, are indeed very human. The science and technology is explained probably as well as can be explained in a book of this size for a general audience; however, I feel that a big plus would have been the inclusion of a few extra diagrams to complement the text by more clearly illustrating how one can come to all the presented conclusions about the universe by simply looking at the MAP results. But despite this minor shortcoming, I feel that the book still deserves 5 stars since it is exciting and well-written, and gives the reader a sense of what it's like to be involved in cutting edge science. It is definitely worth the read - I highly recommend it.	2003-07-04
US	40677041	RMRSMTBRDENMV	019514743X	524822232	The Art of the Infinite: The Pleasures of Mathematics	Books	3	32	33	N	N	Great Math..... Obscure Prose	The mathematics in this book is clear and absolutely delightful - reminiscent of high school math. The derivations, proofs, figures and equations are all very clear and the words immediately associated with them are very useful complements. The problem arises when we are in-between the mathematical expositions, i.e., where historical and miscellaneous other snipets are presented; these would normally be pleasant diversions and would make the book even more interesting. But here, this is not the case. The prose is rather obscure, complex and cryptic and tends towards the quasi-poetic, quasi-philosophical and quasi-parabolic all at once. This is most unfortunate for a math book where simplicity and clarity of expression are paramount. Had the historical and other digressions been written clearly and in plain English, then this book, in my opinion, would have easily been 5-star material. But as it is, the math is worth an easy 5 stars, the prose an unfortanate 1 star for an average of 3 stars.	2003-06-19

The text is clear and engaging; the science is clearly explained; the figures and pictures complement the text superbly; and discussions on human thought regarding the moon's nature and its origin span from antiquity to the present time. I would not have thought that the moon could be such a scientifically exciting subject in this day and age. The author has done an excellent job in combining science with the history of the earth's nearest neighbour in a book that is difficult to put down. Highly recommended!	2003-06-06

Topics that are examined under the microscope of the author's sharp and witty mind include: the science of cooking, the scientific principles behind tool usage, boomerang design and throwing, quick determination the cheapest supermarket, the physics of sex, and more. The author's excitement in describing his scientific approach to these matters stands out - much as an excited child describing the joys of discovering something new and wonderful, but in a clear, lucid, even funny, way. Complete with lots of diagrams and charts, this book is pleasure to read. The author has definitely succeeded in clearly illustrating how the scientific method and the scientific mind work, and all this in a most enjoyable way.	2003-05-12

Broadly Sweeping	The subject of uncertainty is discussed in just about all of its aspects - from the physical sciences to sociology - but with greater emphasis on climate change. The author discusses the meaning of &quot;uncertainty&quot; and emphasizes that it is not synonymous with &quot;ignorance&quot;. He gives plenty of examples in a variety of disciplines to clearly illustrate his point. He explains how the probabilities of various potential causes for certain observed phenomena can be scrutinized and, often with great ingenuity, reduced to near nothingness. This narrowing down of uncertainty can often help facilitate the task of decision makers charged with improving the human condition. This book should be read by anyone who has ever wondered how there can still be uncertainty in a society as technologically advanced as ours. The writing is clear and engaging and the book is difficult to put down.	2003-05-05

Starting with a few basic assumptions, i.e., that Moses did exist (although he does point out that some scholars argue this point), that the Exodus did take place (although some scholars point out that there may have been more than one), and by interpreting the Book of Exodus as literally as possible, the author, a physicist, does a most admirable job of carefully analyzing the ancient writings in the light of modern scientific knowledge. The end results are twofold: 1) a reconstruction of the wanderings of Moses and the Hebrew slaves that does not agree with convention, and 2) credible scientific explanations for the various miracles described, e.g., the plagues of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, the crossing of the River Jordan, etc. The tremendous amount of research done in writing this book stands out, as does the author's passion for the subject matter. The result is a most absorbing account of the application of the scientific method to an intriguing historical problem. It now remains to be seen whether archaeology will prove the author right. Difficult to put down.	2003-04-28

Although many scientists have contributed to this theory over the past few decades, the book focuses mainly on the efforts of Dr. Paul Hoffman, the main scientist responsible for developing and promoting the theory, thus raising its status to level that it has today. This is a very well-written book. It vividly describes the way in which science works, as well as the fact that scientists are all too human. It also contains well-written discussions on the science involved. Such a book should contain diagrams, figures, charts, photos, maps, etc., to better illustrate the locations, ideas and facts presented in the text. Unfortunately, the book contains none of the above - no picture whatsoever; if it did, I would have easily given it 5 stars. Despite this shortcoming, the book is definitely worth the read.	2003-04-07

In a valiant effort to educate professionals and lay people alike, the author of this book clearly explains how to interpret risks and risk data (statistics) in a useful and understandable way. For example, anyone who is wondering about whether or not to undergo screening for breast cancer, prostate cancer, HIV, etc. should do themselves a great big favor and read this book. The author also discusses legal issues such as how evidence may presented in court in order to support a given side of a case just by presenting statistical data, e.g., fingerprints, DNA evidence, etc., in certain ways. In addition, the author discusses a variety of other matters from advertising gimmicks to TV game show strategies. Using the techniques given in this book, readers will be much less likely to be fooled. Clearly written in plain english and in an engaging style, this book should be required reading for everyone - from professionals who provide statistical (risk) information (they would learn how to be more clearly understood) to those receiving the information (they would learn to see through any smoke screens or awkward presentations and thus make better decisions).	2002-07-10

Although the title may seem a bit corny, and the cover graphics even cornier, the book's content is very serious. In a writing style that flows beautifully and logically, the author presents nine &quot;crazy ideas&quot;, one per chapter, and proceeds to review the evidence, both for and against them. By quoting recent research results and analyzing them in the light of other, often conflicting, evidence, the author does a superb job of illustrating how science works and how some seemingly &quot;crazy ideas&quot; may turn out to be not so crazy after all. In fact they can (and some have) led to important scientific discoveries. If this book and books like it were required reading by everyone, they would contribute towards making the general population less gullible about various, often pseudo-scientific, claims and would provide people with the basic tools needed to form their own opinions. This book is a valuable contribution to the world of science. A tremendous book!	2002-04-16

Not this book; it's densely packed with scientific information on its subject matter. From theories on the what happens in the sun's interior to the observed effects that solar activity has here on earth, this book covers most of it in fair detail. It is written clearly and the topics are well organized. Several colour plates, charts and diagrams do much to illustrate the ideas presented. Complete with a glossary, a list of references and an index, this book is well put together. It can serve as a springboard for readers who would like more details on certain specialized aspects of the workings of our nearest star. An excellent read!!	2002-04-08

Naturally, these are about Einstein the scientist or Einstein the man. However, this book is really about Einstein after his death - it's about his disembodied brain and its unique voyage through time and space. A few hours after Einstein's death, an autopsy was performed. Part of this autopsy involved the removal of the brain. The body was cremated hours after the autopsy but the brain was retained for further study. The reason: to see if the great man's intelligence could be explained through the scientific examination of his brain. The entire book revolves around the brain and its keeper - Dr. Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who removed it. In addition to presenting a variety of interesting historical facts, the author has included down-to-earth discussions on brain science and how it has evolved over the years. Complete with unexpected twists and turns and a variety of intriguing personages, the book reads like a well-written novel. It is highly recommended!	2002-03-27

In describing the life of the Roman gladiator, the author includes, along the way, snipets of information and digressions on various related issues, including mini-biographies of noteworthy personages such as Spartacus and certain Roman emperors. Rather than detracting from the book's main focus, that is, gladiatorial games, these snipets complement the book such that the reader acquires a more complete picture of the epoch in which these cruel games were taking place. All that is missing is a suitable collection of pictures illustrating the various gladiator types, their equipment and the arenas in which they fought. Nevertheless, a highly recommended book.	2002-03-11

Being an entomologist, the author preferentially discusses the use of insect activity and development on a corpse in estimating, among other things, the time of death. Relevant cases are discussed. But there's more. The author also discusses a variety of other aspects of importance in the world of forensic science that may be overlooked in other books on the subject. For example, less than honest stategies used by some barristers and sollicitors, some police officers and some forensic scientits in order to ensure that a certain case is resolved in a manner that they feel it should be resolved, rather than by basing it on hard evidence (the specific problems discussed in this regard are those in Britain). A great variety of personal anecdotes - some gruesome, some funny - complete this delightful book. It will not disappoint forensic science buffs.	2002-03-06

Some are popularizations aimed at the general public, some are textbook-like and aimed at professionals in the field while many others are aimed at various levels somewhere in between those two extremes. I would classify this book in the third category - just short of being a textbook (although I can see this book being recommended as supplementary reading in forensic science courses). The author discusses the basic principles of forensic science. He covers different techniques used in much of the field and offers his professional opinion on many cases that everyone is familiar with. The book has been written with a careful choice of words which is indicative of a careful scientist.  Reading this book was both a great pleasure for me as well as a learning experience. It's a real page-turner that is difficult to put down and I strongly recommend it.	2002-02-22

The author starts off in her investigation of ghostly phenomena rather sceptical but with an open mind. In her quest to become a ghost hunter, she learns about the best places to look for ghosts and also how to \\"detect\\" them using actual hard-wired equipment such as cameras and voice recorders which can \\"see\\" and \\"hear\\" things that most ordinary humans can't. Whether these are really due to ghosts or due to natural phenomena that can be explained using well established physical laws is a matter for discussion. No matter what your views are on the paranormal, the author's adventures in investigating this field are very exciting. The book is very well written and difficult to put down. Highly recommended!!	2001-11-23

It is extremely well written in a very readable and friendly style. It describes the search for evidence to support the hypothesis that Amelia Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan wound up on a certain island in the Pacific after radio communication between her and her contacts near and around Howland Island was lost on 2 July, 1937. The four co-authors of this book are all scientists who have been very careful in applying the scientific method in this historical/archaeological research project. Well illustrated with photographs and diagrams, this book is a must read for anyone interested in Amelia Earhart and her fate, in history of the mid-twentieth century, in how scientists work or simply in great detective stories. Very highly recommended!!	2001-11-23
