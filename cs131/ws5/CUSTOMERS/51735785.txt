The breadth covered is refreshing; most other accounts you will read focus only on Harriet Tubman and the full flowering of the Underground after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Bordewich delves much more deeply, covering the passive, Quaker beginnings to the radical movement that spawned John Brown and the attack on Harpers Ferry. He doesn't neglect the major participants, be they white or African-American. The fact that most US History textbooks have forgotten so many of these inspiring individuals is truly tragic.  <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed Bordewich's description of American opinion as it evolved from tolerating slavery towards supporting abolition in theory and finally convincing thousands to join together in civil disobedience and help fugitive slaves. I also found the information about black settlements in Canada to be very interesting.   <br /> <br />Fascinating and very well-written, Bound for Canaan is truly one of the better pieces of popular history that I have read in 2005. Definitely recommended for all history buffs.  <br />	2005-06-02

Kyvig, traces the developments in American culture and lifestyle during this critical period. Using US Census Data, Kyvig calls attention to the demographic changes that occurred over these dynamic twenty years, one of the strong points of this book. Among the technological developments discussed are the automobile, electricity, radio and movies. There are two chapters devoted to the day-to-day aspects of life during that time covering such topics as food, fashion, hygiene, courtship, etc. Kyvig also discusses the impact of the Great Depression, the New Deal and the expanded role of government during that era.<br /><br />As a former history teacher, this book reminds me strongly of an expanded version of the typical US History chapter covering this time period. It isn't terribly deep, but does provide a solid overview. It is well-written, easy to read, and is a good starting point for people interested in the time period (or for students who need help for a research paper). Those of us who want more detailed information will need to look elsewhere.	2005-05-30

Fewer (myself included prior to this book), however, know the true significance of the Battle of Trenton. In Washington's Crossing, historian David Hackett Fischer places the Battle of Trenton in its historical context. The result is a fascinating history that is a work of masterful storytelling.  <br /> <br />One of the things that I really like about this book is that it is so complete and well organized. Fischer begins by discussing the three armies that were in the American colonies in 1776: the English regulars, the Hessian mercenaries, and the American patriots. The cultural and military differences between these forces are not only interesting but they were to have a major impact on the way the war was waged. Next, the fall of New York, with its dire implications for the American cause, is described. Even though we all know how the story eventually ends, Fischer was able to get me on the edge of my chair as if I was reading a thriller. The effects of the works of Thomas Paine, the British campaign through New Jersey, the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, and the Forage War of 1777 comprise the remainder of the body of the book. Throughout, Fischer introduces people and events often forgotten by the average history textbook. As a former art history student, I remember scoffing about Washington standing up in the boat. As Fischer explains, all the soldiers crossing the Delaware that day had to stand because the water covered the bottom of the boats! That is just one of the many instances where history comes to life in this remarkable book.  <br /> <br />Fischer wraps up his book with a conclusion that brings all of the threads together. Washington's crossing is proved to be an historical turning-point, not just an iconic painting. One of the most powerful ideas I was left with was the American \\"policy of humanity\\". As conceived by these men of the Enlightenment, patriots treated their British and Hessian prisoners as if they deserved the same rights that the Americans were fighting for. I found that incredibly inspiring and applicable to modern day events.  <br /> <br />You will also be left with awe for Washington and the Americans of the time. I have never been a hero-worshipper of Washington's, but you have to have enormous respect for a man who created victory out of seemingly inevitable defeat.   <br /> <br />The closing line of the book says it all: \\"The story of Washington's Crossing tells us that Americans in an earlier generation were capable of acting in a higher spirit - and so are we.\\"  <br />	2005-02-10

This is not the sort of book I would normally pick up. I am not a partisan person and neither political party represents both my conservative social views and liberal economic beliefs. As a Kansan, however, the title grabbed my attention. Once I started reading the book, I was hooked. Although I did not know exactly how to articulate it, I have often wondered how the Republican Party has managed to capture the votes of workers, even though its economic policy is tied to the interests of big business.  In What's the Matter with Kansas, Frank details the rise of the conservative movement and the impotency of the Democratic Party in the heartland. <br /> <br />I love how Frank explores politics in Kansas history, making a link to current political happenings. His description of Kansas (and particularly Kansas City metro area) politics is dead-on.  As a former Kansan, he does not denigrate the state but celebrates it.  <br /> <br />Although Frank is a liberal and does discuss issues from that point of view, he is remarkably balanced. He does not vilify conservatives as a group and his explanation of the conservative point of view served to give me a new respect for the conservative rank-and-file.  <br /> <br />I earnestly recommend this book as essential reading for concerned Americans, no matter what political affiliation you may have. It gave me a new understanding of American politics, not just of my home state.  <br />	2005-01-26

It boggles the mind that a person can commit the atrocities that he did and yet have a magnetic hold over an entire country. This book, The Women Who Knew Hitler: The Private Life of Adolf Hitler, by Ian Sayer and Douglas Botting attempts to shed some light on Hitler's psyche, especially how it relates to his dealings with women.  <br /> <br />There is a long discussion about just what made Hitler tick. Apparently, the prevalent view among psychologists is that he had issues with sexuality and was traumatized as a child by his father. You definitely are left with the impression that Hitler was a sick, sick individual even prior to WWI and his entrance into politics.   <br /> <br />I found the book's title to be a bit misleading. Yes, there is a lot of information to be found here about Hitler's numerous dealings (most of which could hardly be called relationships) with women. However, the book stretches on after the death of Hitler and his wife of one day, Eva Braun, and covers their cremation (in graphic detail), the fall of Berlin, and the Soviet, British, and American attempts to unravel the truth behind Hitler's death. The authors also include a significant discussion about and primary source material from Walter Wagner, the lowly civil servant who married Hitler and Braun. I found that to be a bit tedious and only tangentially relevant; some of the information has never been published previously, so it seems like they included it just to say they were the first.  <br /> <br />The most interesting part of the book covers Hitler and Braun's relationship. Amazingly, the authors manage to (almost) humanize Hitler through their description of Hitler's physical and emotional decline as the Third Reich fell.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to those interested in learning more about Hitler's psychology and the women who were attracted to him. It is also worth reading for the account of Hitler's final days before his suicide.	2005-01-18

The two never formally met, yet both were profoundly influenced by the other.  <br /> <br />At times it was hard to decide if Epstein was writing history, historical fiction, or a literature book. He seamlessly weaves Whitman's poetry into his narrative and discusses the roots of the imagery the poet used.  I found the Whitman portrayed by Epstein to be a fascinating, unusual person indeed.  <br /> <br />If you are seeking general information about Lincoln, this is not the book for you. If you are a Lincoln admirer who wants a new perspective on the president and the times he lived in, I would encourage you to read this book. If you are interested in Walt Whitman, this book is a must-read as it is important both from the biographical and literary stand-point.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-01

It is incredibly well-written and contains a fascinating account about the first crusade. It will keep you riveted until the end.   <br /> <br />Asbridge doesn't merely give a blow-by-blow of the action - although action is certainly not lacking. He explores how the crusade got started and the varied motivations of the participants. Characters like Bohemond, Godfrey of Boullion and Peter the Hermit come to life and fascinate. <br /> <br />One of the great strengths of this book is Asbridge's discussion of the history of crusade scholarship - the ideas scholars both modern and medieval had about why the crusade happened and how it played out. I also found that some of the things I learned in college (and I didn't graduate that long ago!) about the crusades have been disproved by further scholarship.   <br /> <br />I always have found it ironic that, in a later crusade, western knights pillaged Constantinople when they were supposedly Christians united against a common foe. The roots of breakdown of the relationship between the crusaders and the Byzantine empire are explored, answering my questions.  <br /> <br />Asbridge is remarkably balanced and objective when discussing the sensitive area of Christian and Muslim relations. My only complaint is that a couple of times in the beginning of the book that the author includes some snide comments about Christianity.  <br /> <br />Kudos to Thomas Asbridge! I hope he decides to write another book about the other, less \\"successful\\" crusades.	2004-10-26

The Great Fire of London was incredibly dramatic and Tinniswood shines when he brings in primary sources such as the diary of Samuel Pepys and the poetry of the time. I also appreciated the maps that tracked the progress of fire as well as other city plans and artwork included in the plates. Another strong point of the book is the discussion of the English fear of \\"papism\\"; the 17th century mind equated Catholicism with a loss of liberty, which is something I hadn't heard of before.  <br />  <br />That being said, I found Tinniswood's writing style to be less than dynamic. The book does read quickly due to the subject matter, but I wouldn't call it great literature in and of itself. I would also have liked more historical background on the Restoration to help place the event in context. This book was worth the time to read, but this book is, for me, one to borrow rather than add to my personal library.	2004-10-01

I found Tales and Trails of Illinois to be packed with fascinating stories that definitely helped me to get a greater knowledge about not just Illinois but also the role Illinois has played in American history.  <br /> <br />The book is divided into 52 brief chapters that hit the highlights of a topic in Illinois history. Many of the chapters were originally published as a series of newspaper articles and left me wanting more detail, especially the one on \\"Illinois's Most Heinous Murderer: Herman Webster Mudgett\\". Someone needs to do a movie on that guy - he could be the prototype for Hannibal Lecter!  <br /> <br />In short, this is an interesting, quick read but definitely not for someone looking for in-depth research or analysis.

Kagan's book goes over them all - succinctly, yet with enough detail that you feel you are getting a thoughtful consideration of the events.  In that sense, this is better than a \\"Cliff Notes\\" version, but it is truly a fast-paced read. <br />  <br />There are helpful maps throughout the book that are a major plus. Two things would have made this a 5 star book for me. The first would be a glossary or perhaps an introduction that covers basic Greek terms, customs, etc. that are used throughout the book with little explanation. After all, this book was designed for the non-scholarly crowd. Second, I would have appreciated further biography of the major players in the war - Pericles, Cleon, Nicias, Thucydides, etc. Also, an elaboration on the differences between the Athenian and Spartan cultures would have been nice. I wanted to have a better sense of who the people involved in these events actually were.  <br /> <br />When I picked up this book, I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into. After all, the Peloponnesian War occured in the 5th century BC, a time far remote from the problems our terrorist-laden world faces today. Instead, I found myself drawing parallels between those long ago events and our era. This is an interesting and thought-provoking book which I definitely recommend.  <br />	2004-09-12

Mary was brought up in a decadent French court and trained to be a queen in all ways except ruling. Elizabeth's childhood fears, lingering questions about her legitimacy for the throne, as well as her need for family explain many of the actions she undertook during her long reign.  <br /> <br />The author uses many quotations throughout the book frome extant letters and documents. At times, it was a little annoying to wade through the \\"Olde English\\", but it really did serve to make the personalities of the two women come to life. I did feel that Dunn relied too much on foreshadowing and would have preferred a more chronological, detailed relating of the information at times. That is the primary reason for the deduction from 5 to 4 stars.  <br /> <br />Don't expect this book to cover all of the areas of the lives of these two regnant Queens. Instead, count on a thoughtful consideration of the relationship between two women who, truly, were \\"cousins, rivals, queens\\".	2004-08-27

As a former American History teacher, I now know what a disservice I did my students in my treatment of John Adams.  <br /> <br />I taught them that he was a Federalist, a staunch enemy of Thomas Jefferson. I also mentioned that he approved the Alien and Sedition Acts and that the XYZ Affair happened in his administration. That was it - we moved on to the \\"more interesting and important\\" Thomas Jefferson.  <br /> <br />I have been enlightened by McCullough's fabulous biography of John Adams. To some extent, what I taught my students was correct, but there is so much more to learn about John Adams. What really struck me was what a man of integrity he was. I wish he was the model for politicians; he and his family sacrificed so much to serve this country. He was a man of modest income who, unlike Jefferson, lived within his means. He remained true to his roots and to his convictions. I never knew the crucial role Adams had in the ideas that formed the Constitution and the international diplomacy of the day.  <br /> <br />I found so much to admire in this book. And, unlike a previous reviewer who found it boring, I thought it was very well-written and incredibly engrossing. It is a lengthy tome at 651 pages in the hardback version yet I finished it in 4 days - a testimony to both the author and the man who was John Adams.  <br />	2004-08-24

I did enjoy reading \\"Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly: The Remarkable Story of the Friendship Between a First Lady and a Former Slave.\\" It rates a 3 out of 5 stars for me because of the lack of depth, particularly in the latter part of the book.<br /><br />Like most people, all I had really heard about Mary Lincoln was that she had emotional issues and ended up being committed by her own son. This is true, and the book does a good job of relating the childhood events that warped the young Mary Todd.<br /><br />Lizzy Keckly, the slave who buys her freedom and becomes Washington DC's leading \\"modiste\\", is a fascinating personage who well deserves the attention the book gives her life. I found the description of Lizzy's life in slavery to be very powerful.  In particular, the passage where her master hires someone to \\"break her\\" made my stomach turn and the barbarity of slavery struck home anew.<br /><br />The beginning of the book starts out strong. The chapters alternate between the lives of the two ladies. After Mary marries Lincoln, however, I feel the book loses steam. I craved more description not only of their lives but of the historic events that surrounded them. Maybe my perception of this book was hurt by having just finished David McCullough's masterful \\"John Adams\\", which is lavish in detail. Maybe there just isn't enough evidence out there about Mary and Lizzy's lives after they hit middle age. (I'm willing to buy that about Lizzy, but about Mary? It seems unlikely.) At any rate, by the time you hit the last few chapters, it seems as if the author is hurrying to finish up and I think it ends abruptly.	2004-08-24

However, as a teacher of American history who has done many hours of reading and research on this subject, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to the average reader. First, being from the Kansas City area, I noticed that McLynn has made some factual/geographical errors. None are major, but even if they are only typos, it possibly calls into question the accuracy of the rest of his research. Second, although I personally found his continuous analogies between US and British/South African history interesting, I think the average American (certainly my students) would be swamped by the whole Boer War, Zulu, etc. Third, his writing style (rather like my review) is a bit verbose and the book doesn't really take off until the third chapter.  All things considered, I would recommend this book for history buffs. The stories of the early years on the California and Oregon trails are very fascinating.	2004-08-09
