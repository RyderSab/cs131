In this case, it is the system of mass torts, with the protaganist telling an unlikely story of how he stumbled upon a fairly small tort case, which led to an even bigger one, and his subsequent fall into massive ligitation cases... and the pitfalls. <br /> <br />Almost all aspects of mass torts and the fallout are explored.  Certainly Clay (the proteganist) is seduced into a system of greed and money. The victims are also shown - the victims of mass ligigation and the ultimate problems with that as well.  Even doctors and drug companies have their say, with prescriptions of drugs which have great benefit, but often have side-effects as well. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I have to side with the drug companies, who, despite the drawbacks of drug, are ultimately trying to do great benefit to society in their attempts to fight disease or extend life.  For a good alternative, read Strong Medicine by Arthur Hailey.  Nobody benefits with good drugs with lethal side effects.  Nobody benefits with no new drug developments that don't have some side effects.   <br /> <br />In the end, the best result is lost in the legal battle.  All drugs have side effects.  However, the cost of single cases verses class actions also have a side effect.  I don't know the right way to go forward - and nobody else does either.  Both sides have powerful lobbiest groups.	2005-07-01

One ends up in a family of wealth and priviledge - the other to a middle class family.  However, both are twins in many ways - they are both smart, like the same kind of girl, and are adept at their chosen paths of finance and criminal law.  Each also faces a common enemy - a character of low worth who is only out for himself. <br /> <br />Both sons of fortune find themselves married to a woman who loves them back - one an immigrant who had a secret; the other a scion of history.  Though they run against each other in a governor race, each respects each other enough to put politics aside in the favor of what is right. <br /> <br />Archer makes major mistakes in this well intended novel - one man would not defend his enemy in court in a heated political campaign.  Another is that marriage to a foreign born translates into citizenship is another - one man loves his Korean  born wife to death.  Plus AB blood type means somebody can take blood from anybody.  The sons find out their common blood via this, but it is a medical mistake. <br /> <br />However, I do agree with Archer's main point - that blood doens't matter much.  Both twins agree to keep their heritage secret.   Adopted or by blood, they had parents who loved them and cared for them - and raised them with all their love.  The only effect of their revealing the secret would be to destroy their families and loved ones.  Both are honorable men who put ambition apart from family in the end.	2005-02-04

Red Rabbit offers us a look at the early career of Jack Ryan as a CIA intelligence offer in light of history - and a look at some of the major players in the Clancy novels. <br /> <br />The plot centers around an attempt to kill a polish priest - actually, the Pope - who threatens to resign and rejoin his people in the wake of solidarity.  Jack Ryan, who only 5 months earlier jointed the CIA is put into a British post.  Ed and Mary Pat Foley, new station chiefs in Moscow have their first coup -  a \\"rabbit\\" = in thie case a KGB cypher clerk who knows about the plot against the Pope and is willing to trade what he knows for the West for himself and his wife and child. <br /> <br />Where the novel falls down is in realism.  Jack Ryan, despite being an honorary knight (Patriot Games) would not have been assigned to the UK after only 5 months of service.  Ed Foley probably would have dismissed his rabbit's first attempt as a clumsy KGB operation.  Plus, the good guy's don't really win in the end. <br /> <br />The novel makes it harder to reconcile real history with Clancy history.  Clancy history deals with right wing presidents (Clear and Present Danger), left wing presidents (Sum of All Fears; Debt  of Honor), and Ryan's own unwilling Presidency (Executive Orders and The Bear and The Dragon).   <br /> <br />Still, Jack Ryan remains what he always was - a man of honor fighting a war he believed in.  He was a rookie in this book, but proved himself a master of intelligence in later books (stealing Red October; then compromising the KGB head with it to get him to defect).  Even as the President he swore before God he would do his best.   <br /> <br />Yes, after Red Rabbit it was time for Clancy to give Jack Ryan his decent retirement - a lifetime of service.  From a simple act to prevent murder (saving the Prince and Princess of Wales - and their child) to the highest office in the United States, Jack Ryan served as best he could.  He also let his wife pursue her own career as a doctor. <br /> <br />Clancy gave us some great spy thrillers, from his breakthrough book (The Hunt for Red October) to Red Rabbit (the last of the Jack Ryan series).  Some backstory (Patriot Games) to his term in office as President (Executive Orders and The Bear and the Dragon), Clancy gave us a hero.  Even more, his side heros John Clark and Domingo (Ding) Chavez have provided heros on the CIA operations wing.  John Clark earned it through service and his own serial killings of drug lords (Without Remorse); Ding earned it throught faithful service (Clear and Present Danger) and a hard apprenticeship.	2005-02-04

Even his stint in the marines was a means to an end for a doctorate education.  But what he got in the end was a sense of duty, a mind adept to intelligence analysis, a wife who was not only a great surgeon but the love of his life, and a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br /> <br />This is where it all begins.  Jack Ryan saw a murder about to happen, and he stopped it, disabling one terrorist and killing another.  What he didn't know was that the intended victims of a kidnap plot were Prince Charles, Princess Diana, and their infant son (Prince William).  In an instant he became a hero, with an honorary knighthood and the wrath of the group who had planned the operation.  He even got the personal gratitude and friendship of the royal family. <br /> <br />The event sends Jack into the CIA, a job he had resisted before, in an attempt to learn about the why and how of the attack.  He proves to be great at intelligence, with his information leading to the arrest of another group of terrorists.  But what nobody could predict was that after the escape of the terrorist Jack only wounded, he would go after him again.  A small dinner party with the Prince and Princess of Wales, as well as close friend (and eventual vice president) Robby Jackson and his wife turns into another terrorist kidnapping.    <br /> <br />Patriot Games is a great introduction to the forces that brought Jack Ryan into the intelligence game.  Jack showed his honor and intelligence, and in the history of the books, lots of people would rue the day he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  From figuring out how to steal a top secret Soviet submarine, compromising the head of the KGB, and stopping what would have been a nuclear war, Jack Ryan served the interests of the United States - and the world.  He even ended up as President, a job he didn't really want but accepted and did to the best of his ability.  Patriot Games is the start of a saga of a man who became a legend.	2005-02-01

This time, he's returned to the roots of his first book (A Time To Kill) with a minor character, and a different perspective, both from the hero, and the time (1970 - 1979).  <br /> <br />The hero in question is a journalist... though perhaps a failed one.  He couldn't hack it in college, and went to the small town of Clanton, Mississippi.  His boss was probably mentally reduced in any case - it was all about the obits.  When they are dead, glorify them.  When the paper goes into bankruptcy, our hero gets a loan from his grandmother to buy it... and thus his story. <br /> <br />It's a tale of a small town, with legal justice, blacks who made good, a powerful local boy who went bad, a trial, different churches, and good ole boy justice.  After all, somebody is killing off the powerful and weathly son of a clan who got released... after a conviction for murder and rape.   <br /> <br />In then end I do relate to the first person of the story.

But Rudy's one case is legal dynamite.  His clients were the victims of a bad-faith case that is textbook.  He has the dirt, and has the witnesses that has the dirt.  He has a favorable judge.  He is even smart enough to know how to turn the defendent's high priced lawyers into unwitting shills for his case. <br /> <br />Maybe being a rookie with nothing to lose worked in his favor.  He had no money, no professional reputation, or anything else to lose.  The trial scenes are amazing.

It's still fun.  I have to say though, if Grisham could rig the trial in Baylor's favor, he could rig the outcome.  Maybe the point is that his client got the justice she deserved, I have to feel her lawyer should have walked away from it all with the money.  Still, he got the girl - and maybe that was enough.

It nearly got Agatha Christie kicked out of the Detection Club (an organization of writers who agreed to play fair).  It put her on the map.  It's her best work - ever.   <br /> <br />The book is a first person account of a Hercule Poriot mystery, done by Doctor James Sheppard, a country doctor serving his community.  He was there from almost the beginning, and his narrative provides a wonderful account of the murder of his friend, Rodger Ackroyd. <br /> <br />Rodger Ackroyd's female friend took her own life.  She wrote a letter to him before she did so, naming the man who ruined her life - a blackmailer who knew she killed her first husband.  Rodger read the letter to Dr. Sheppard, but wouldn't continue when he realized a blackmailer would be exposed because of it.  Dr. Sheppard begged him to continue and get the name - to no avail. <br /> <br />Ackroyd didn't comply.  James Sheppard left and went home, only to get a myserious phone call telling him Rodger had been murdered.  Murdered he was - and the letter was missing! <br /> <br />Enter Sheppard's neighbor, Hercule Poriot.  Dr. Sheppard plays Dr. Watson, following the sleuth around and recording what he finds.  From a missing son to a married maid; from the theft of household money.   <br /> <br />In the end, Poroit invites all the cast to a room where he talks about the case, and says he has a solution - which he will reveal to the police in 24 hours.  The only way for an innocent man to be saved was for the real killer to confess one way or another... and even though Dr. Sheppard has all the facts of the case, he can't see how Poriot could put them all together into a surprising solution of the case. <br /> <br />In short, if you want a book that will shock you, read this one.   Well crafted, with devious plot devices, Christie showed her genius for detective fiction with this book.  It was a work of genius because she had the imagination to dosomething amazingly original.  It may have nearly got her kicked out of the Detection  Club, but history has sided with her - she was right all along.  This is her most classic work of all time.	2005-01-12

If there is a problem with them, it is that Kemelman tends to beat people over the head with clues, and sometimes the police work is less than stellar.  This mystery is one of those cases. <br /> <br />The real problem is that a serious examination of the crime scene shows the police theory was all wet.  The facts were that the victim was shot dead-on, and a clock (providing the \\"time of death\\") was also shot.  The altered timepiece is a classic of detective fiction, but since it has been so widely used, the clue was obvious.  Also weak was the evidence which got the killer.  Surely somebody who wiped the clock clean of fingerprints would also have wiped the key used to alter the clock in the first place.  However, the motive is where everything falls down.  The new (unsigned) will the victim's lawyer drew up acknowledged he had a blood son.  Once that fact was out, there was no way the killer could inherit the victim's money. <br /> <br />The Rabbi's conclusions were good, but a good CSI would have had half the case solved.	2005-01-12

There is always a battle to whether his contract is renewed or not, and he's often in conflic with social or political desires of his congregation.   <br /> <br />The contrast is that Rabbi Small does deeply care, but in his own way.  He cares deeply about justice and Jewish law, and follows his own ethics and beleifs.  If he feels his congregation is off track, he tells them, and opposes things no matter what the cost might be to himself. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong; he very well might have been the wrong Rabbi for the community.  In many ways, he was suited to a different age.  Temples, like churchs and other social clubs, have needs and desires.  Rabbi Small was kind of a throwback to a different age, and may not have been the right man for that community.  It's easy to see how a principled man like Rabbi Small would not fit in; when he took a stand it was for a reason, and he wasn't much for bending a little to make a friend or save his job.   <br /> <br />Over the course of the  books it's also shown he has an affinity for younger jews, best described in Monday the Rabbi Took Off.  During a Sabbath dinner, he argued on points with a college student.  Afterwards, the student told his father he liked Rabbi Small.  They may have disagreed on issues, but Rabbi Small neither pandered or lectured him - he treated him like an adult worthy of respect. <br /> <br />Rabbi Small's first adventure found himself as a suspect - because the murder victim's purse was found in his car.  Suspicion shifted away to him to one of his flock, but the Rabbi pointed out things in his member's favor - which went right back at him.  What he showed was an unwaring bias for the truth - as well as logic and interpretation of the facts.  He even told the police chief that just because he was a Rabbi didn't mean he should throw out his common sense. <br /> <br />If there is a weakness to the book, it was that the mystery wastoo easy to solve by the reader.  The same thing which triggered Rabbi Small's suspicions was the same flag which led me to the correct solution.  Still, it was a fun book, and a great introduction to a great series of books.	2005-01-11

He never wanted his father's life, and his father never wanted it for him, but he became it. <br /> <br />The novel bridges the gap between the first book and the second movie, and a bit more.  Michael really wanted to go legitimate, and give up all the underworld power.  He tried, but his first attempt failed.   <br /> <br />Plus the book gave us the insights as to why Fredo betrayed the family.  His plan was both nutty and logical.  Plus it gave reason as to why he was so weak (and a bixexual), but also managed to get an ex-Oscar winner as a beard , if nothing else. <br /> <br />In all, it did leave a LOT of room for a sequel.  For example, while the stage was set of Michael's children to progress (in Godfather 3), nothing was said for the death of Tom Hagen, or his children (important to Godfather 3), or the fate of Geraci.  Indeed, the weakest point of the novel was the exclusion of Frankie (Godfather 2 movie; as a capo, he deserved some time).  Peter Clemenza was disposed of well -  very much in line with his roles throughout all books and films.) <br /> <br />Finally, the novel harped too much on thinly  disguised people.

However, while he found evidence that confirmed the story, he found a real investigation didn't hold water. <br /> <br />What did that get him?  Disgrace, in bad with the police, a dissolution of his partnership, and a struggle to do his client some REAL service.   <br /> <br />Indeed, while Lam's ethics are often thin in his adventures, he always was dedicated to his client.  The question is whether he could not only provide his client with the REAL service he needed (innocence on a murder charge), but also make a profit and be able to stroll into his office without being a murder victim himself - at the hands of Bertha Cool, his partner!	2004-12-15

Born of immigrant Polish parents, one of whom become a powerful and wealthy businessman, she was tutored well, learned well, and trained well.  Until she threw it all away to marry the son of her father's most bitter enemy. <br /> <br />Richard Kane had also defied his father to marry his love, and the two were cast off without a cent into the world.  However, not only do they live on love, but they forge their own business empire in the process.  If Kane and Abel were rivals, but successes; only to see their greatest dream dashed at the hands of the other, Richard and Florentyna show what their father's might have achieved by working together. <br /> <br />Indeed, together they build the empire of both their father's dreams.  Both of their fathers recanted their hatred at the end, and they build together.  But eventually success at business bores Florentyna, and she goes into politics.   <br /> <br />Florentyna is a success in many ways in politics.  Congress, then the Senate... and the White House?   <br /> <br />Indeed, I don't know if the novel makes or breaks itself with the dirty tricks played at the end.  Florentyna made her biggest mistake when she didn't outright reject one offer.  Character wise, I think that is the biggest weakness of the novel.  Florentyna wasn't that stupid or naive.  Would it have hurt to have had her cave in if the man had outright lied (and still trapped her), and her serve her term as vice-president with no illusions about him?  PLus, I have to wonder if she, faced with the end of her career, wouldn't have conceeded defeat - and then dragged down certain people as well?	2004-12-13

Immigrant Abel had faced horrors in his past, but rose to fortune though hard work and seizing of opportunities.  William Kane was born to money, but he took his small stakes, coupled with his intelligence, upbringing, and education, made it into a million before he graduated from college.  Abel had to make his money well after that. <br /> <br />Part rags to riches, part Romeo and Juliet, all interesting, Kane and Abel document the birth, life, and death of two very different men who are both successes, but also end up destroying each other's greatest dream in a senseless feud born of ignorance.   <br /> <br />The saga spans over 60 years, and constrasts Kane's easy life and born duty, with Abel's hard life, and struggle to forge his own destiny.  However, the two men are very much more alike than different.  Both are driven to win in their own way.  In their own way, each lives out his destiny.  They also each also destroy the other's ultimate dream in a battle of power and hatred.  The irony is that battle never needed to be fought if they both had a little more information. <br /> <br />This also contrasts with another theme of the novel - what could they have achieved by working together as friends instead of enemies?  Ulimately, it is not for them to decide, but for their children.  Richard is his father's son; Flornentya her father's daughter.  Does their love form a bond between their families - or an even greater rift with neither parent willing to admit they might have been wrong? <br /> <br />	2004-12-12

I first got hooked on his short stories, with their twists.  Since then, I've read everything I could get my hands on.  All have twists, but some were no surprise to me, while other's really caught me off guard.<br /><br />This one caught me off guard.  It was a fascinating story of how several different men came together to try and recover their losses from a con man.  The con man in question, a Harvey Metcalf, knew what he was doing.  He set up a company with the sole intent of defrauding the public, but in a clever enough way to never get caught at it.  However, four men, a Oxford Professor, an Art Gallery Owner, a Harley Street Doctor, and an English Lord with a taste for the ladies, the biggest victims, meet with the goal of getting their losses back.<br /><br />Three of them come up with scams of their own in a few weeks; all designed to con the con artist.  The fourth, the English Lord, can't come up with one, though his talent as an actor plays a great part in the other scams.  However, his girlfriend / fiance'  / wife DOES come up with one... and THAT scam is the biggest twist of the novel.<br /><br />\\"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less\\" is an apt title - the defrauded men want nothing more back than their money - plus all expenses they incur recovering them.  Do they get it?  Can they end up with their account in balance?  The short answer is no - they were still owed $1.24 at one point... but that changed overnight....	2004-12-12

It sounds pretty mundane, but this background will lead him into some extraordinary situations, beginning with his debut novel, Angels and Demons. <br /> <br />He is called in to aid the investigation of a high ranking CERN scientist - purportedly murdered by the Illuminati - a centuries old brotherhood with a grudge against the church.  Indeed, it is their time to strike, against the four cardinals most likely to be the next Pope, and against the Vatican, in the form of an antimatter bomb stolen from CERN. <br /> <br />Langston's knowledge leads him into a centuries old puzzle which is the key to stopping the plot.  He chases clue after clue and comes up with the right results... but still the identity of Janus, the hidden enemy who set the whole plot in motion is concealed until the end. <br /> <br />Dan Brown knows how to write thrillers.  Ordinary people in extraordinary situations is a good way to put it, but Langston has combined his knowledge of Art History with facts and fiction to produce his best book to date (better than the Da Vinci Code).	2004-11-25

I really can't help by compare this to \\"A Woman of Substance\\" by Barbara Taylor Bradford in some respects, since they are both England-based department store stories covering the same time period. <br /> <br />However, Archer's story behind the story of a store I can't help but compare to Harrods focuses on the real problems facing a young entrepentuer, particularly the growing pains of expansion, particularly obtaining access to the capital market.  Here the duchess character provides extremely shrewd insights, first backing the shop with 60 pounds, then later suggesting a front man, in the form of Charlie's old army Colonel.  In those times, the man with the right tie and a nobility title got access to capitial.   <br /> <br />Of course, there is the obligitory villain, in this case a lady only a few generations down from a merchant, but who inherited none of the good sense, and all of the snobbishness of the gentry.  She doesn't see what her own husband and father see - all she cares about is the success of her two boys.  Unfortunately, one takes absolutely no responsibility for his actions, and ends up at the end of a hangman's noose in the end, and the other has no merit, but she attempts to give him control of the empire Charlie built. <br /> <br />Are there flaws?  Sure there are.  Guy crosses paths a bit too often, though admittedly it's a key focus of the book.  Cathy also gets elevated from outsider to inner circle.  Certainly she was Daniel's fiance', but she was also referred to in his suicide note.  However, she remains in the inner circle after Daniel's death. <br /> <br />Still, I loved the writing technique of each chapter covering a time period as seen by a certain character - and the next one backing up and summerizing it from a DIFFERENT character's perspective.  Some things one character might have thought was hidden may be an open secret to others, or one character may be deceiving another as to what they knew, and how they acted on it.   <br /> <br />Archer tends to try to twist his tales at the end with a surprising revealation, though except in his short stories (which I highly recommend), he usually doesn't succeed with me.  Old Charlie's secret was completely predictable to me, and totally in character.	2004-11-24

However, while they can open the door, Ka intrevenes and yanks the Gunslingers to the opposite of their intended destinations.  <br />Roland and Eddie find themselves sent to Maine in 1977 - and smack in the middle of an ambush.  Can they survive and track down Calvin Tower - and convince him to sell the vacant lot to protect the Rose?  And what other important person awaits them and Ka?<br />In 1999, Susannah and Mia put each other in mutual deathgrips over the fate of the demon-baby.  Mia can't function in New York, and Susannah needs information about the unwelcome visitors to her body.  The answers lead to the revelation of the true father of the baby - and the horrid birthing chamber needed to protect all three lives.<br />Meanwhile, Jake, Callahan, and Oy find themselves on the more dangereous mission of tracking down Susannah and Mia in New York, 1999.  Jake's touch can help - but can he find the clues left by Susannah during the few times she was free of Mia?  Callahan is no gunslinger, and Jake is only a kid, but both prepare to face their destiny against the vampires and the low men.<br />Most shocking of all is the fate of somebody very important to the Tower - one hinted at in book 5, and brought fully to life - and a reported death.  <br />In the end, will anybody be left to guide the remaining gunslingers to the dark tower - and know that the underlying sickness is known - can they do anything to save it?	2004-06-08

Through Ender's story, and the men monitoring him, we learn all the lessons of strategy and command; and how to grab every available resource.  At first, he realizes gravity has no meaning in a null-gravity situation.  Upon promotion and denied an opportunity to learn, he trains with a sub-class, defying convention.  When he first disobeys stupid commands, he turns defeat into stalemate.  When a sub-leader recognizes his value, but the commander doesn't, he turns a suicide mission into a strategic advantage for his army.  When he is finally given command, he throws out the rulebook in favor of what works.  <br />Ultimately, his genius is not just by understanding strategies and tactics that work but also how to utlitze other people in his favor.  He trains his subcommanders how to lead and recognize strategic and tactical opportunites, but also gains their respect as a commander.  When the wargames are rigged more and more against his favor, he simply responds by adopting new, innovative, and effective methods against his enemeies.  <br />I found the end-game predictable, but beyond the military victory, I found a kind of solice.  Ender never really wanted to beat an enemy; he wanted them to stop fighting and live in peace.  Perhaps that is the true genius of Ender's Game - he never wanted war, but when forced into it, he played to win the war forever.  <br />I haven't read the sequels, but I hope in them Ender focuses his mind toward creating peace instead of war.  There is just as much strategy in winning a cold war and living in peace as there is to a hot war and fighting with many dead on each side.	2004-04-30

The book Debt of Honor questions whether the Japanese accepted surrender at the end of WWII, of if it was just a retreat.  Honor and Saving Face means much to the Japanese culture, and, if like in many Clancy novels, if they were pushed &quot;one step closer&quot;, could they gain an upper hand and threaten war once again?<br />To fully appreciate the situation in Debt of Honor, the full political and military ramificaitons of Clancy's works must have come true - ICBM nuke disarmament, and a general reduction of war forces of both sides of the eastern block and NATO.  <br />So if Japan becomes a nuclear power, and takes over Guam, could the US respond - especially if their financial situation is thrown into chaos via computer &quot;virus&quot; - or deliberate trap?  <br />I don't agree with several of Clancy's postulates, such as ICBM disarmement (in face of the China threat), or a President putting a member of the opposite political party in the VP slot (as happened to Jack Ryan in the book).  While perhaps necessary for future novels (such as Execute Orders), Jack Ryan's accendency to the Presidency is needed, politicians and congress members would reject a VP like Jack, since he would be a heartbeat away from the top job.  However, the book is a satifying work of fiction well worth the read.	2004-04-20

But then things went wrong, and the President, most of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the cabinet were killed in a terrorist action.  Jack Ryan finds himself the head of the country - a job he never wanted.<br />Faced with being the most important President since George Washingon, he faces a press who thinks he is playing by political rules, an enemy in the middle East who is out to cripple the country, and an ex-Vice President who claims he never really resigned.  <br />The middle-east thinks he's weak because he won't crush political enemies.  The press pounces on him because he is being honest in a political world of dishonesty.  His enemies think it's the right time to cripple the country - with an attack on the country, and an attack on his daughter.  <br />The question Clancy asks is clear - could another man, faced with a devestation of the American political system, rise to the occassion and reject tyrnany and kingdom over democratic law.  Plus, could he, if faced with terrible domestic and foreign policy issues, make the right choices to combat threats, both foreign and domestic.  <br />Executive Orders put Jack Ryan, an honest man who served his country the best he could, in the position of being President.  He wanted strict constituational law, but was willing to take a step beyond it (in preventing free travel in the wake of germ warfare crisis) - and very willing to be impeached and removed from office as a cost of his decision.  <br />Jack Ryan is the hero of the everyday man - somebody who understands the world and the threats, and is willing to admit his weakness in domestic affairs.  When facing rebuilding the government, he wants people who really know what the real world is like.  In the end, he neither wants or craves power - he just wants to do what he thinks is the right thing.	2004-03-19

On the far right, there is the side-effects and pitfalls of a military war on drugs (Clear and Present Danger).  On the far left, there is radical environmentalists (who consider humans a parasite on planet Earth who should be destroyed).  <br />What Clancy really writes about is the costs involved in any kind of political change, and the dangers of extremists.  Clancy always takes very real political situations one step further.  Is it right for radical Muslims to promote nuclear war (The Sum or All Fears).  Is it right for radical enviormentalists to commit genocide (Rainbow Six). Plus, what would happen if an honest, non-political man found himself in the position of George Washington - faced with rebuilding the government from the ground up - but with a press who was so used to lies and political posturing they didn't know how to deal with an honest man who was doing his best (Executive Orders).  <br />What I would believe is somebody who admits there are no easy answers.  The far left would undermine national security; the far right would eliminate privacy rights.  Clancy solutions are often poetic justice (the wacko enviromentalists being forced to live in the jungle without ANY technology from a knife to clothing - all that was part of technology, not nature, plus a drug lord, which the US decided they had no legal right to keep, being delivered to his opposition in Columbia).	2004-03-19

He's not even at Hogwarts before he's attacked, threatened with expulsion, has his reputation smeared by the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet, and sent off to a secret society that provides no answers to his questions.  Hogwarts treats him no better; Hagrid isn't there, Dumbledore barely acknowledges him, and the new defense against the dark arts teacher refuses to provide practical lessons - then proceeds to terrorize the school with her harsh and restrictive rules.  Even his budding relationship with Cho Chang runs hot and cold.<br />All this plus Snape's and Malfoy's usual treatment of him pushes him to the breaking point in the fifth book in the series, and Harry spends most of his time frustrated and angry at the forces that are ruining his life.  With his usual outlet of Quidditch denied him, his only refuge is leadership of his own secret - and rule-breaking - society of students dedicated to learning to fight the dark arts.<br />Despite the costs, Harry is willing to put it on the line to fight for what he believes in - even if it means a direct confrontation between himself and his friends against Lord Voldermort and his Death Eaters.  In the end, victory is his, but this time the price might be higher than Harry is willing to pay...<br />Major secrets regarding the past history between Voldemort and Harry are revealed, as well as a few about the Dursleys.  Harry learns many harsh truths in this episode, including the fact that many people he looked up to weren't as perfect as he thought, and others he despises may have some right on their side.

While investigating the return of a man missing for ten years, Mason sends Della Street out to interview the man before the police get there.  What happens?  When the man can't be found by the police, Della is charged with spiriting away a material witness.  Burger plans to convict her, then try Mason as an accessory, convict him, then institute disbarrment proceedings against him.  This will end Mason's career of legal dramatics and &quot;outwitting the police&quot;.<br />Mason doesn't care anything about a murdered man, a wounded man, or the missing man who is the prime suspect - all he cares about is aquitting Della Street.  And since Burger made it personal, Mason refuses to give the true solution to him during or after the trial. After all, if he did so, he'd be &quot;outwitting the police&quot; once again...	2003-04-28

Mason's explanation of the time difference was that it was keeping sidereal, or star time, which gains 4 minutes a day.  He played it up big in the newspapers <BR>to create a juristication battle between two counties, but the clock disappeared, the juristication was settled, and Mason's client went on trial for the murder of her embezzling husband.<br />The circumstantial evidence was tight, and Mason's only hope was to try and introduce the clock, once again found buried and set on sidereal time.  However, there was no legal doctrine he could find to introduce it into evidence... until Mason realized he'd walked into his own baited trap.	2003-04-28

Mason manages to erase the recording right out from under their nose, but then finds himself defending Hattie Bain on a murder charge.<br />Mason's courtroom dramatics hit a high note when he produces a theory which changes the time of death, and puts an witness with an seemingly unshakeable alibi on the hot seat. Then the theory is collaborated with evidence overlooked by the police, and all hell is raised with the prosecutions theory of the case.	2003-04-28

The book documents several cases of men who found themselves tried and convicted of crimes.  In many cases, they were innocent.  In other cases, they were guilty.  Gardner's task force served the cause of justice.<br />What is most astounding about this book is the insights as to how things go around and come around.  In this case, Gardner argues against life/no parole sentences for &quot;habitual criminals&quot;.  50 years later we see the same kind of laws passed, life/no parole for &quot;3 strikes&quot; offenders.

He comes home to find barbed wire strung through his house, a sexy woman in a bikini on the one side, complete with a court order allowing her to be there - and himself out of half of his own house.  It seems the man who built the house put it partly on his own, and partly on his wife's separate property with the assurance he'd get clear title.<br />Things get worse when the man ends up dead with a knife in his back - in his client's side of the house.  Caught in a tangle, his client refuses to give his story to everybody - including Mason.

However, under the terms of her father's spendthrift trust, she was powerless to marry until age 25 unless she risked being cut out completely.  She retained Perry Mason to break the will, despite it's iron-clad terms which gave her uncle absolute power over the fortune in the trust.<br />The will did leave a loophole - if her uncle died before the terms expired, Frances would get the money absolutely.  So it was completely in her favor when Frances's uncle was murdered - until she found herself as the prime suspect.  <br />This was Mason's first recorded trial, though not the first book (The Case of the Velvet Claws was the first, and had no trial scene).  He handles it expertly, but it all comes down to a typical Perry Mason trick to confuse a witness.  It works, but not as well as some of his later works.	2002-05-26

Under the treatment of Dr. Denair, she revealed under drugs that she had killed her uncle with cyanide, then tossed the bottle into a lake, weighed down with shotgun shot.  Unfortunately for her and her doctor, there was a tape recording of the drug-induced interview... and the nurse's boy-friend was a police detective.<br />Dr. Denair laid out his problem to Perry Mason, who put together a plan to carefully investigate the matter.  In the end, he recovered the bottle from the lake... and it only contained a harmless sugar substitute.<br />However, the nurse blabbed to her boy-friend, and the police became interested.  Then the D.A. found a SECOND bottle in the lake, filled with cyanide.  Mason found himself stuck with a client who had confessed under drugs to a crime... and found himself accused of tossing one of the bottles into the lake.  <br />It all comes down to a legal showdown as to whether the drug-induced confession, combined with the recovered bottle, can be admitted as evidence.

However, when her employer ends up murdered, the evidence points to Janice as a blackmailer and a killer.  Even more surprising, Perry Mason puts on no defense evidence, effectively betting Janice's life on one small detail, a detail which sets off a firestorm of legal fireworks and has Hamilton Burger spitting nails.<br />This is a novel that defines Perry Mason; one where he goes up against a mountain of evidence, but finds a different analysis of it, combined with legal tactics which run circles around the district attorney.

Fuhrman points out where police errored in their decisions, and provides his own tips on how to better run an investigation into catching a serial killer.  He makes good cases for both more public information, and continues the theme of his previous books into how proper investigation techniques can be used to solve any crime.  <br />The Spokane police eventually caught the killer through a lot of hard work.  Furhman Monday morning quarterbacks the investigation, showing how the killer could have been caught two years earlier.  While this might seem presumptious coming from most, I've already given Fuhrman credit where credit is due for his work documented in &quot;Murder in Greenwich&quot;.  <br />The book is a good read, and I look forward to his next.
