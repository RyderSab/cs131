Other reviewers have justifiably praised the novel.  I must admit that the novel had about worn out its welcome with me just prior to the 2nd chapter (which begins with the revelation about John Ames Boughton's true life).  This last section, about 30 pages, is exciting and moving and made me happy I didn't put \\"Gilead\\" down.<br /><br />\\"Gilead\\" follows the plot archetype of \\"a person from the past returns to town\\" but Robinson's treatment of this old theme is highly original and the denouement (SPOILER ALERT!) which transfigures John Boughton from a \\"Lucifer\\"-figure to a complex human sufferer is perfect.  Ames' new view of John Boughton is religious and novelistic at the same time, which is high praise.<br /><br />I still believe this novel is still too long.  It should have been cut by 20-25%.  Sometimes less is more.  But highly-accomplished with a very fresh, unusual voice.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-27
US	50417922	R238UOHSTGSNFL	0312319517	604432126	Avenger	Books	2	5	7	N	Y	Forsyth once wrote one of my favorite suspense thrillers	The Odessa File.  Judging from \\"Avenger,\\" those days are long gone.  Forsyth needs to a) get an editor; b) begin to care about his readers again; c) rediscover a sense of pride in his craft.<br /><br />The narrative never attains any flow, which sharply reduces the level of suspense of this action-packed, yet dull novel.  One problem is that Forsyth seems to think that every character must be introduced with a full-length birth-to-current biography.  That's OK, if you're 15 years old and are just starting out writing, but points to the degeneration of Forsyth's skills.<br /><br />\\"Avenger\\" is a wildly-implausible, sloppy piece of garbage.	2004-08-16

The novel in the end is too schematic. At the same time, Padilla's reflections on his chosen themes are too abstract, something which couldn't have been helped by a very indifferent translation, and don't come to life.

The protagonist, the magistrate of an outpost of Empire, wants to lead a life of sameness, in which historical conflicts and violence are avoided. His desires are sympathetic and his actions are sometimes laudable. Intruding into the sleepy life he and his outpost lead, police and army officers come, bringing with them violence, torture, but also possible a more realistic view of what is happening in the outside world. I won't be spoiling the novel by saying that the tension between these two views is not resolved at the end.<br /><br />A fine, fine book. I highly recommend it. Coetzee is both a very skilled novelist and also very interested in ideas.	2004-04-13

Let's start with some of the pluses: an interesting plot in an interesting setting. Some beautiful writing. The description of Sula's household growing up is colorful and engaging. Those are important things. I do have some other less flattering comments:<br /><br />Morrison sometimes seems intentionally obscure to me, by heightening the difficulty for the reader, despite the fact that the plot events are often attention-grabbing. The central event of the book can almost be missed at first if one is not paying closeattention, for example. The exact source of Sula's antagonism towards her grandmother is also unclear. It strikes me at these times as very much a novel by the academic Morrison is.<br /><br />SPOILER! I also found the group suicide which concludes the book's 1941 episode gratuitous, unnecessary and utterly unbelievable. I'm not sure why Morrison included this plot development -- what does it really add? -- but it's a serious plotting mistake. A mass suicide is too major an event to be included in passing -- either concentrate on it or don't include it.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning that Sula, from 1973, is dated in its moral attitudes. Morrison documents a series of absolutely horrible events -- murders of children by their mothers, Sula's institutionalization of her grandmother, and lesser sins like adultery and fights -- with no reprimands. The only time she issues moral judgement is by placing scare quotes around \\"good\\" as in \\"the 'good women' \\". The work reeks of an early-1970s radicals' moral permissiveness which strikes me as odd, reading it in 2003.<br /><br />A more substantive aesthetic criticism is that the final scene, in 1965, just doesn't pack the punch it could have. A personal judgement.<br /><br />So the novel has good and bad.	2004-01-08

I think her first four or five novels are just great suspense thrillers.  But her Scarpetta series became increasingly bleak and tortured and I gave up on them after Point of Origin, which seemed to be chock-full of obtrusive personal mannerisms, and didn't even bother to read Black Notice.  Someone gave me The Last Precinct and I only started reading it because I was bored -- and almost put it down after the dreary first 100 pages.<br /><br />But around 125 pages in, Cornwell stops concentrating on Scarpetta's damaged psyche -- some of the criticisms here of the psychologizing are valid -- and resumes doing what she does best, deftly-plotted forensic mysteries.  The book came alive and was incredily suspensful after that point.  I made the mistake of reading it when I was alone at home and was often so afraid I couldn't move.  Cornwell has the unique ability to absolutely jolt one upright with surprising plot developments.  Last Precinct has several such moments and the plot hangs together in a very believable, if dark way.  This is a superb thriller and I heartily recommend it.  It's also clearly part of a series - Blowfly, her next book, continues the story.<br /><br />So I highly recommend this book.  One piece of advice: Cornwell more than any other suspense writer needs to be read in sequence.  If you are thinking of reading a Cornwell, start with her excellent first novel Postmortem and read them in order of publication.  Last Precinct is not comprehensible to those who don't know Point of Origin, although I didn't read Black Notice (Last Precinct starts minutes after the dramatic conclusion of Black Notice).	2003-12-29

You can find several howlingly-bad sentences per page.  The opening page is a great example of the train-wreck-bad overwriting that makes up Brown's &quot;style.&quot;  Brown is an absolutely abysmal writer and I am confident that most of you could write a superior treatment of his idea than he could.<br />In a way, it's a shame because the &quot;transhistorical&quot; conspiracy and the info about Jesus and medieval secret societies he used as a prop was very interesting.  I learned interesting things from the novel but, as a thriller afficionado, I could not believe how talentless a hack Brown is.	2003-12-23

Jhumpa is a graceful writer and an absolutely effortless storyteller. Her plotting is so uncontrived and her pacing so natural that you barely notice that a novel is being constructed. I actually don't think she is a natural novelist -- in a way, \\"The Namesake\\" is more like a group of intimately linked short stories -- but that's more a description, not a critique. I haven't read \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" but, after \\"The Namesake,\\" absolutely intend to. Lahiri is such a gifted writer that her work demands attention.<br /><br />About the content, I am a first-generation American of European parents and I found some of the descriptions of Gogol's experiences extremely telling, thought-provoking and moving. In fact, I had strong identification with many of Gogol's experiences and feelings. The book made a big impression on a personal level. I think many first generation or foreign-born Americans will connect with it, too.<br /><br />Subsequent to reading \\"The Namesake\\" I made sure to read \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" and that group of short stories struck me as being a preparation for this novel, and not as accomplished or successful.	2003-12-23

Finkelstein puts together a long list of reasons for failure, things to look for in companies which will fail soon and ways to avoid failure.<br /><br />One problem is that the study is flawed by a lack of anything like a control group. For example, he makes a big deal about Motorola's reluctance to venture into digital cell phones in the mid 90s -- surely a big recent corporate failure -- but then doesn't examine a situation where a company (correctly) refused to overhaul its product line (such instances do occur). The lesson he draws is excessively oversimplified and I'm not sure it applies anywhere beyond the cell phone market of the mid 90s.<br /><br />Another example: Finkelstein points out to cases of CEO hubris, in which an invincible company head leads the company to ruin for various reasons (poor listening, a sense of invincibility, a reluctance to tolerate criticism, et al). The potential dangers of an excessively headstrong leader is no news to either business or general readers. But Finkelstein doesn't acknowledge that headstrong leaders can often be vital assets to a company. He doesn't go into enough detail and instead delivers an incomplete, unsatisfying answer to the problem such CEOs present.<br /><br />In general, the book is marked by shallow analysis, repetitive and overarching review of the case studies, and underdeveloped understanding of marketing and finance (for example, Finkelstein makes a howling mistake in discussing Tyco's accounting), let alone technological trends.<br /><br />The sheer amount of repetition is also unhelpful -- Finkelstein must refer to the Motorola analysis a dozen times in the second half of the book without ever expanding on it -- and the endless series of lists in the book's second half... well, how can one really \\"use\\" 12 bullet points from list #7? Bad organization, which reflects an inability to boil down his case into a shorter, more concise summary.<br /><br />Sophisticated businesspeople will have no use for this sort of analysis. Less advanced readers will not profit from the book's weak organization, which betrays a lack of thought. Not recommended.sticated businesspeople will have no use for this sort of analysis.

Glass is a marvellous stylist and is more interested in conveying mood and images -- a city approached by jet is a &quot;jewelbox&quot; -- than in plot.  The entire book is structured as a series of alternating episodes from the present and an important time in the past.  Not an easy read by any means.

The narrator manages to be very interesting despite the humdrum surroundings. Highly recommended.<br /><br />The short stories that precede the novella are good but not particularly noteworthy. Unlike the most recent reviewer, I actually liked Dynamite the most. Smiley is a gifted craftsman and an interesting writer. I've managed to overcome my first reading of her -- the dreadful Duplicate Keys -- and her idiotarian op-ed current affairs writing to have real respect for her as an artist. On a side note, \\"Moo\\" has to be one of the best comic novels I have ever read. \\"The Age of Grief\\" isn't quite up to that level of quality and imagination but it's a very accomplished and affecting novella.

As a thirtysomething reader, I found Spark's take on the topic interesting and the ending (as well as the mystery of the phone calls) oh so effective.<br /><br />Spark takes pains to show how the wisdom that is supposed to accrete over the years has not worked and her characters display the same vices and virtues that they have their whole lives. The ending is sudden and heartbreaking because the absence of direction the characters show never abates.<br /><br />Another strong effort by one of Britain's literary doyennes.	2003-07-02

The House in Paris is my first encounter with Bowen's work and definitely won't be the last. She is a beautiful writer with occasional unidiomatic lapses which are compensated for in stunning paragraphs elsewhere. The scenes and characters come alive; the best way I can describe it is that they are \\"intensely lived.\\" Bowen is never on autopilot. In particular, I found the scenes where Karen visits her aunt & uncle in Ireland and the scene in which Henrietta meets Mme. Fisher very evocative and enthralling despite the lack of anything much happening. Bowen also has a surehanded dramatic technique when needed.<br /><br />I did find some weaknesses, which is why I give the novel 4 stars (but then the \\"degree of difficulty\\" is high). I don't ever find the romance between Karen and Max to be accessible; Bowen's portrayal is intentionally inscrutable. Though only nine, Leopold seems to think and speak like an adult. In general, I don't agree with Bowen's much praised portrayal of either child.<br /><br />All in all, a very worthwhile, often intense novel.	2003-05-16

The book starts well enough with an intriguing story about three kids abandoned by their father.  Crais ruins the book by solving the mystery quickly in the first half of the book.  That leaves about a hundred pages for utterly unbelievable shootouts and a farcically complicated end-game designed by Elvis.  Are we supposed to find the notion of multiple shoot-outs believable?

(One of the reviewers below writes that nothing happens -- I wonder if they finished the book.) I agree that the book isn't a conventional novel -- see it instead as an Event with the main protagonists drawn in illuminating detail. For example, the description of Tashmo is terrific -- his admiration for Reagan, his aspirations to look like a semi-Cowboy dude, his persistent womanizing, the whole routine about fixing his truck while he is up in NH guarding the VP.

It's very difficult to put down and the characters truly come alive, if not always in an appealing way.  The daughter is a terrific creation that made me question how carefully I looked at the world: her attendance to nuances and close attention to reconciling apparent discrepancies in her surroundings is at once inspiring, intriguing and a genuinely realistic view of an eleven-year-old's psyche.  The way Abrahams ties in her interest in Sherlock Holmes is also very successful.  I also thought the portrait of the parents' class anxiety was pitch-perfect.<br />My only reservation was the ending which didn't jibe with the Tutor's general approach.  Needless Hollywoodized violence, in short.  That's the only minus in this impressive novel.<br />I highly recommend it.	2003-02-06

The plot is a mystery story taking place in a decaying Rust Belt city in the late 70s. The solution requires some careful thought to unravel, although it is never entirely spelled out, but in any case, the book is not a genre novel. I beg to differ from some of the other commentators: the troubled protagonist's musings on America are not meant as straight commentary but represent his periodic deterioration into a delusional state.  In the years since I read this book, it has really stuck with me.  The ending is deftly handled and an example where insinuation is more effective than a blunt statement.<br /><br />Despite the Booker Prize nomination, I think this novel hasn't received the attention it deserves.  Read it for yourself and enjoy.  Collins' later career doesn't seem to have lived up to this effort so far, but he is still young.	2002-12-31

In a word: vacuous.<br /><br />Content: Does Cunningham add anything to the plot of \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" except for reflexive criticisms of traditional lifestyles? This novel is like a bad cover version. And, to paraphrase Elmore Leonard, Cunningham seems to specialize in writing the type of passages which people \\"skip over.\\"<br /><br />Style: Cunningham is a blandly elegant writer. He makes the serious mistake of quoting passages from \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" Now, I am not convinced Woolf's writing is always completely successful, but she is undoubtedly highly original and thoughtful in her prose style and is brimming with things to say. The contrast was seriously damaging to Cunningham.<br /><br />That this novel won the Pulitzer Prize shows that the prize has become an entirely pr-driven affair.

Harkening back to a pre-PC era where predators subtly seduced young, nubile women in a New England campus (Mt Holyoke, no doubt), the plot consists of a disjointed flashback into a post-60s environment very different from our own, when the advocacy of sensual liberation is regarded much less suspiciously than it would today.<br />One particularly effective device is the scrambled ordering of plot events, which is masterful.  In fact, the narrative sequencing of events has to be a kind of exemplar for other novelists.  Some would say Oates style is overwrought, but if you accept Beasts as a genre novel, then it can be better accepted as highly accomplished and often memorable.<br />So keep in mind the limitations within which Oates works and enjoy!	2002-11-20

Middling.<br /><br />Judged as a thriller: The action directs itself towards the conclusion. The problem is that there really is no plot.

The plot flows very smoothly from there and drifts into an older murder in which the protagonist's family was intimately involved. Just excellent -- and it's his first book!	2002-06-04
US	50417922	R2WXVAAY5YCFIC	0679432477	340719393	Empire Falls	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Pleasant midbrow novel	I genuinely enjoyed Empire Falls and thought much of it was entertaining with many likable characters and interesting situations.  I also thought the ending (the catastrophe at the end) was a terrible novel-writing decision -- such an event is the focus of the plot, not some ancillary byproduct that helps to resolve the situation.<br />It's really more of a midbrow novel -- some serious themes mixed in with easy-to-digest writing and colorful characters -- not that there is anything wrong with that!  Also, proves the Pullitzer is a purely political award, since there is no way this decent book would have won it other than through lobbying.  In sum, I would actually recommend it but lower your expectations and you will be rewarded.	2002-06-04
US	50417922	RE7CHR78K2RXK	039331894X	572503863	Desperate Characters: A Novel (Norton Paperback Fiction)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Excellent novel	I was directed to this novel by Jonathan Franzen, the chief sponsor of its revival. I agree with the positive reviews below but want to point out that the theme of the 60s is very important to the novella. The action takes place in the midst of that urban catastrophe, NYC in 1970. The assault on the Bentwood's comfortable lives comes from all directions but also the increasing cultural decay of the era, from crime (the break-in at their country home) to the drunks having breakdowns outside their window to the piles of refuse lining their street. The writing is excellent and the imagery very imaginative.<br /><br />A big turn-off for many readers is that the characters are not sympathetic -- not a one. I highly recommend it to the reader who doesn't insist on liking those he/she reads about.	2002-06-04
US	50417922	R385RVLM8I7XJT	0786216719	290669941	The Running Woman	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Good idea but not realized well	The Running Woman has fundamentally a very good concept for a psychological thriller. The bottom line, though, is that Carlon does not have the chops (the technique) to pull off the trick. I wouldn't advise a reader to seek out this book and don't think it belongs in the classic category of detective novels.<br /><br />The first problem is that Carlon fails to pull off that key distinction necessary in a novel in which the protagonist spends much of the first half confused by events: making that character confused but not dim. Unfortunately, the protagonist, Gabriel, comes off as the latter.<br /><br />Another major problem is that there are dark hints that the entire mystery is connected to the death of Gabriel's husband a few months earlier. I am just amazed that Carlon did not pursue the angle and just let the whole matter drop.<br /><br />On a more detailled level, Carlon's writing is often confusing and full of cloying conversational tactics. None of the characters emerges as fully drawn or, for that matter, particularly interesting. Following the details of the crucial incident, which happens prior to the book's opening, is also confusing. This isn't necessarily a mistake -- the book's tension, at least in the beginning, depends on a level of confusion and misremembering what initially doesn't appear to be a very important hour -- but I couldn't help but feel that, again, there is a key distinction between confusing the reader and presenting a clear picture of confused memories.<br /><br />In sum, a disappointing effort. It makes one realize just how difficult it is to write an effective thriller.	2002-04-17
US	50417922	R3RTFNPYOSW7H9	0425184234	814475128	A Small Death in Lisbon	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Medium --	I think this is thriller is basically a failure.  Although it is often interesting and Wilson has crafted a highly sympathetic protagonist in the form of the Lisbon inspector investigating a murder, the plot does not hang together.  There are a few unlikely coincidences and, ultimately, the solution does not meet the smell test in that it is too complex and seems tacked together to tie this complicated novel's many plot threads together at the end.  Wilson's weaving in of sex is downright gratuitous (to the point where female readers may be thoroughly turned off) and his style is awash with oddly uniodiomatic English which we could possibly attribute to his long stays outside of Britain.  In sum: an overhyped medium-level thriller.	2002-04-03
US	50417922	R2FG5ZZ20PLAVG	0440235448	390826918	A Sight for Sore Eyes	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellent psychological thriller	This is a characteristic (meaning very high quality) novel of psychological suspense from Ruth Rendell.  It reminds me in many ways of her &quot;Keys to the Street.&quot;  Three different stories -- of  different people from very different social classes who have never met --  are brought together in a believable and intriguing way.  The characters  are convincingly and imaginatively drawn and the conclusion is surprising  yet successful.  Rendell is simply the best thriller/mystery writer ever  (I'm confident of this assessment) and this is a must read for any thriller  fan.	2000-06-06
US	50417922	RZPDYEPP6K306	0679720766	368234708	A Fan's Notes	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Disappointed after all the hype	I have been hearing about \\"A Fan's Life\\" for a while -- it certainly has a cult following -- and found the first two chapters very interesting. But the book lost its steam. The narrative persona grew less interesting as one got to know him better. Very egocentric -- he doesn't have all that many interesting things to say and, whenever he travels beyond the New York Giants and alcoholism, his attacks on the oppressiveness of late 1950s America and \\"normalcy\\" have a simplistic pre-60s character that simply makes the book dated. Psychiatric asylums, anomie and drunken sprees simply can't shock us anymore and the book, beyond these details, doesn't have the depth or innovative aspects to make it special. To boot, Exley is only a moderately gifted writer. That said, the first chapter and his description of his first two confinements in upstate NY asylums are interesting and kept me glued to the page.<br /><br />I would give this fictional memoir a mixed evaluation. It is aging badly and covers territory that has been done better since.	2000-05-16
US	50417922	R3A0A2QTUHNGW9	0375704914	61936832	A Demon in My View	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Good effort	I am a big Rendell fan -- she is probably the best mystery author ever -- and want to give this a positive evaluation.  Written in 1976, Rendell has gradually become better and better.  What stands out about this suspense  novel is the gripping portrait of the sick central character.  So  psychological themes and portraiture are prominent.  I read it within two  days, so it is suspenseful.  But I wouldn't say it is her best work.  Well  worth the read anyway.	2000-04-05

I enjoyed Runaway Jury &amp; Rainmaker, so I have liked some of Grisham's previous efforts, but this has to be the 1) lamest, 2) laziest, 3) most boring, 4)  most sodden ending (yes, sodden is the perfect word) effort I have ssen by  a major writer in a long time.  Grisham should retire.  This novel would  not have been published without his name on it.	2000-02-23

I have enjoyed Harris's previous books (esp Fatherland) but I think this is the best yet.  The plot is both exciting and psychologically interesting.  And contrary to what previous readers have stated, I think  this is a rare suspense novel that keeps the quality of the plot line up  until the final page.  Harris is also a gifted writer and has done a lot of  thinking and research to come up with this plotline.  I emphatically  recommend it, esp. to readers with an interest in Russia.	2000-02-15

I honestly don't think I will remember much about it three months from now, so I wouldn't say it is memorable.  The premise -- a  mystery writer asked to solve a fifty year-old crime -- is not believable.  The dialogue writing is painful.  I can't recommend it.	2000-01-12
