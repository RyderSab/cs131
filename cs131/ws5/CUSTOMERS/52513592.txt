I assume that it is because he was never a President; however our country will not be the great economic, and world power that it is now without him.<br /><br />I will not get into details, some of the chapters seem unnecessary until one looks at them as an overview to understand the man and his motives.  Anyone who will attempt to seriously read this wonderful biography will understand what I mean around page 400.<br /><br />I could only imagine what would have happened if Mr. Hamilton would have lived to finish out his life and would have been elected president.  The first (and probably only) president not born in the US.<br /><br />I think any presidential candidate, and for that matter any high ranking government official, must read this book in order to understand the foundations, ideals, and basis this country was founded on.	2005-02-28

Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Makes you think	All of those who read this book in order to find a formula or even a guideline are in for a disappointment.  This is not a textbook, this is a book written to give one an idea.  The book does not teach you how, or why, it opens up a whole new way of thinking and gives the reader new directions to embrace change, and follow new ideas in order to take the business in a new direction.<br />This book has given me many things to think about, I view the marketing department in a whole new way, and as someone who has a say in the company, I even bring out new ideas which break the mold and take the company into a new direction.<br />This book has given me the tools to come up with those ideas.	2003-06-18

There is no way for us to know  exactly what was said, and who was thinking what, but I felt he went a  little beyond his &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, and &quot;The Last Full  Measure&quot; being much more free with historical characters.<br />Mr. Shaara  did justice to General Scott, who to this day does not get the credit he  deserved, but I think he got a bit confused with the character of R.E. Lee  in his youth.<br />All in all, I really enjoyed reading the book and if you  enjoyed this author's previous works, you'll enjoy this one also.	2000-08-09

This book discusses what some of our historic sites got wrong, the politics behind the markers, what they  impley, and the damage they are doing to our society. It is very  interesting to see how our culture changed, it's ideas and ideals, and if  you look carefuly at the markers you could also tell and what time they  were put up, buy whom, and what where the social state of mind than.	2000-07-25

I could not put this book down, not only did I learn quite a few things, and enlarged my understanding of other important historical events, but I had to put the  book down after almost every chapter and think of what Mr. Loewen is  saying.  \ Right or wrong is not the issue, but he raises some very  disturbing points about our education system, which should be looked  closely by teachers and parents alike. A very insightful book, well thought  out and makes a wonderful discussion topic among friends and other  interested parties.	2000-05-19

Ambrose really does put a lot of effort in this book and it shows, he has been to the places he talks about, his  descriptions are accurate, and best of all, he does not  &quot;beautify&quot; history.  He tells it like it was.  Mr. Ambrose also  goes deep into the reasons the expedition took place, Jefferson's reasons,  his correspondence with Lewis, and the politics of the time.	1999-08-25

In my opinion, Mr. Benson has captured the essence of book Bond in this novel, not  movie Bond.  This is  a wonderful Bond novel, and I recommend it whole heatedly.  This book  reads like a book, not an outline for a movie.	1999-08-03

It just seems more honest and less self serving, General Schwartzkopf admits mistakes, and positions he has taken for political reasons.  It makes a very interesting  read about decision making in the higher ranks of the military.  If you've  read Powell's book, you'd like this one, and if you haven't, read it after  this as a great supplement.	1999-07-30
US	52513592	R32T36EB9TTWGM	0345407288	621445218	My American Journey	Books	4	2	7	N	N	A Must Read.	I read this book in chunks, and could not put it down, every moment I had free, that book was in my hand.  General Powell is a very admirable person, someone who defeated the odds, and have endured a lot.  This book should be  required reading in schools, not because of the great story, but because it  shows a small part of the bureaucratic machine in Washington, and how big  decisions are made.  Which I found fascinating.<br />I loved the little  stories that are shared with the reader, the stories you don't get from  everyone, the little jokes and humanising character I only hear about in  the news.<br />I could not help but notice that the last part of the book is,  or seems like, very self serving, where the General explains how he was  right, while the others were wrong, and how he managed to come out as the  good guy.  I'm not doubting the man, but it seems a bit extricated, and  becomes a bit too much.  Still, this is a man who deserves admiration.<br />At the end of the book there is a list of General Powell's Rules.  I  printed a copy and have it hanging in my office.	1999-07-16

The author has managed to capture moods and locations within the pages, all  the while creating his own unique style.<br />This is a historical romance,  which plays like a nightmare, every time you'd think things can't get  worst, they do.<br />The hero is a stubborn man, who stands by his word, his  kins, and his friends, no matter what the odds are	1999-07-08

He has a wonderful sense of history, he is not afraid to admit his mistakes, and does not criticize.  I can not stand historians who argue  with should, could and would.  Mr. Ambrose does none of that.  I can't say  I agree with every conclusion he draws, but that's what makes like  interesting.	1999-06-08

I liked this book better than the former one; Mr Benson is getting close to portraying Bond as a cold blooded, drunk, SOB.  He is not there yet, I still get the feeling he is writing with a movie in mind.<br />The story is  good, and I like the references to past stories, and the book shows the  author did his research.<br />My grievances with the book is that the ending  and some of the story is written specifically for a movie, the dialog is  sometimes ludicrous, and the situations are not believable.<br />It's not  Fleming or Gardner, but Mr. Benson is getting better.	1999-04-22

If anyone have told me a couple of years ago he or she was going to write a book about the battle in Somalia, I would have laughed and wrote it off.<br />Boy, I would  have been wrong.<br />This is a very engaging book, methodical, and caring.  The author did an excellent job representing all sides of the conflict in  an engaging manner.  One could tell he did a tremendous amount of research,  and most important, he did not relay on dry military reports, but  interviewed all involved.  This is also a fascinating look at the life of  the soldiers, the conflicts between the different units, and represents the  views of the commanders, ground troops, and pilots.<br />I would just like to  say that he did do justice to all involved, we need more books like that.  Also, don't forget to read the notes at the end of the book for more  insights.	1999-04-16

It seems to me the author was writing the book with a movie in mind, what happened to the aging secret agent going through mid-life crisis?  What happened to the kinky, chauvinistic, alcoholic, cold blooded killer we all know and  love?<br />Don't get me wrong, I liked the story, even if it is predictable,  and I enjoyed reading the book, I guess it's not the Bond I'm used to.<br />My  fault .... but if you are looking for a nice, light, Sunday afternoon read,  this is it.	1999-04-12

A fascinating book about Europe W.W.II as told by the men on the front lines, not a media hugging officer or a dry historian.  Ambrose captures the sense of history from both sides of the fence, sticks to the facts as  we know them and keeps his comments to a minimum.<br />The best part is a  large portion of the book is actual quotes and personal stories taken from  the men and women who were actually there.  The book starts off a bit slow,  but picks up momentum as one gets going, and than it's hard to put it down.	1999-04-09

I was a bit disappointed because it seemed to me that the  author just looked at the pictures of the comic books, and turned them into  words, without adding any new insight.	1999-04-09

This stories makes you appreciate where you came from, and what people have done to preserve our way of life.  The most fascinating parts are not the stories of the men and women who went on to  bigger and better things, but the stories of those who came home, settled  down, and lived a full life.<br />This is not a history book of WWII, but it  does give you a great appreciation for the men and women of that  generation.<br />I just hope Mr. Brokaw will follow this book with a well  deserved sequal.	1999-02-15

It is written with a flare, and brings a closure to the Civil War.  The author manages to bring history alive, and made me feel as if I knew  the leading generals, Robert E. Lee, and Ulysses S.

The books is a  fictional account of those who are about to die, know it, and still go  forward contemplating life's big mysteries and gaining appreciation for  their comrades, and those they left behind.<br />  The problem I had with  this book is that it seems as if the author was testing my knowledge in  both English grammar, and Greek pronunciation of personal names.  I have no  problems at all with geography, or the English language, and I love  history, but it seemed to take away from the story, and becomes a burden  after a while.<br />  If you are, or were in a close knit combat unit,  this book will bring back memories.  If you were not, but ever wandered  what makes the men click, this one is for you.	1999-01-29
