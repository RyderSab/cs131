And yet it never seems confined. I have not seen this episode on TV, so it may have been different to watch as it never changed location, but when reading it things flowed very well. Once again the Doctor has to save the world, this time with the help of Leela. The story takes place in the early 1900's and the newly invented electric generator plays a central part.    Don't expect a lot of character development, which is typical for these novelizations. Do expect lots of action. A quick fun read. Enjoy!	2005-10-13

It also seems to have more scenes in it that do not involve the Doctor. The Doctor is assisted by Jo in this one as he attempts to save the world (again :) The Master makes a return as the Doctor's opponent. I found the ending of this one to be rather mundane, somewhat anti-climactic. <br /> <br />All in all an OK read, but not one of the best. Not sure if all the editions of this one are illustrated, but mine was with a handful of pictures mixed in to the book. The book also seemed longer than many of the novelizations, weighing in at 180+ pages rather than the typical 120 or so.	2005-10-12

Don't know if this flows from them being written with Tom Baker in mind or if it's just a coincidence. This is another fun one. Nothing too complicated (although of course the Doctor saves the Earth again), but an entertaining read. The Doctor is assisted quite well by Sarah in this one as they blunder into and attempt to foil a plot to conquer the Earth by the evil Kraal's. <br /> <br />Not a complicated plot but a quick read and pretty enjoyable. Do not expect lots of character development or deep thoughts, just read it for fun. <br /> <br />Enjoy!	2005-09-25

In a case of mistaken identity he finds himself the target of the vengeance seeking Clanton brothers. The Doctor's companions in this one are Dodo and Steven.    The setting is the American west back in the 1870's. The story is told by Doc Holliday on his deathbed and represents what really happened in the shootout at the OK Corral. Turns out the Doctor was involved in the gun fight and helped turn the tide. This story is a break from the more serious \\"save the world\\" missions the Doctor normally takes on and is instead a \\"just for fun\\" kind of story. I have no idea how historically accurate the story is (the \\"real\\" cast of course, not the Doctor's group), but I found the western heroes and villians colorful and the story was fun to read.	2005-07-21

Yes, the Doctor once again saves the world, this time aided by Jamie and Zoe. But the enemy is not particularly well portrayed. The immediate enemy is the Tobias Vaughn, who runs the company International Electromatics. But the real enemy is the largely unseen cybermen. The Doctor's interactions with Vaughn feel somewhat formulatic and the cybermen are lacking in definition. Took me a few days to get through this one as I did not feel the urge to pick it up when I got distracted by something else. Typically theses novelizations can be read in one sitting or are interesting enough that you want to pick them up again as soon as you get the chance.	2005-07-19

The Doctor is not the main character and he does not even save the world. This is a story about the Doctor's roll in the siege of Troy by the Greeks. It is told by Homer, who says that this is as it really happened, rather than what he wrote in the Iliad. It has all the same characters (Odysseus, Paris, Achilles, Helen, etc) as the epic poem. We also get the inside scoop on where the idea for the Trojan Horse came from. <br /> <br />The Doctor is joined by Steven and Vicki in this one. They miss their targeted time for a trip to Earth and instead arrive 10 years into the siege of Troy. This is not the typical serious Doctor Who story, but rather a bit tongue in cheek and most entertaining.	2005-07-16

Wait a minute, he says that in an awful lot of stories, I'd hate to see the most most dangerous enemy ever. <br /> <br />The Doctor, along with Jo as his companion, are still stuck on Earth in this one. Unfortunately, so is the Master. The Master hatches yet another plot with the invention of a machine that can remove the evil from a hardened criminal. How can this be a world dominating move? Hmmm, guess for that you need to read the book. <br /> <br />I found this one a bit less interesting than many of the other novelizations I've read, but still an OK story. It takes less than two hours to read, so there are certainly worse ways to spend your time.	2005-07-14

The Doctor enters into the middle of things with Peri at his side. He runs afoul of gun-runners, the army, political intrigue, and a host of other minor irritants.

The warlike Dominators, completely lacking in emotions beyond hate and anger have landed on Dulkis. The Dulcians are an extremely pacifist bunch who just hope the Dominators will take what they want and go away. Of course no one really knows what the Dominators want, except that it may involve the annihilation of the planet. The Dulcians are so unable to act that they decide to do nothing and hope the hateful, deranged, kill without thought and show no remorse afterwords Dominators will suddenly decide that they should abandon their path and take after them and sit about talking about nothing for months on end and pretend the rest of the universe does not exist. <br /> <br />The Doctor is joined by Jamie and Zoe. They manage to get a few Dulcians to help them and together they take on the Dominators and their powerful Quark robots. Can the small group save Dulkis and possible the galaxy from the evil Dominators? A quick fun read, nothing too deep or philosophical here.	2005-06-16

The Eternals, beings that live outside of time and whose existence is endless, are in a race through space. The Doctor and crew land the TARDIS on (actually in) one of their race ships at the behest of the White Guardian. The Doctor's companions in this one are Tegan and Turlough.    The winner of the race gets Enlightenment, a dangerous prize to give to an Eternal. The Eternals really have no purpose to their being and without the Ephemerals (such as you and I) cannot generate enough independent thought to do much of anything. However with Enlightenment in their grasp and unlimited time to use it, they could destroy the entire universe.    Can the Doctor and company save the day once again?

All five incarnations of the Doctor take part (although Doctor four has a fairly token part) and each has a companion or two with them. Doctor one has Susan, Doctor two has the Brigadier, Doctor three has Sarah, Doctor four has Romana, and Doctor five has Tegan and Turlough. Even K9 makes a cameo. There are appearances by a Dalek and a horde of Cybermen as well. Then to top it all off, the Master takes part as an ally of the Doctor. <br /> <br />If there is a flaw to this book it is that there is too much going on. With five Doctors to follow around the story jumps from one to another at quite a pace. Still, it is an enjoyable story and a quick read.	2005-06-07

The Doctor has lots of help in this one, his grand daughter Susan and two of her teachers, Ian and Barbara.    Ian and Barbara refuse to believe that the Doctor can travel through time, so he takes them into the past where they meet up with a tribe of cavemen. The tribe has lost the ability to make fire and the Doctor must decide whether to give it back to them. To make matters a bit more confusing there are two warriors jockeying for leadership of the tribe, so the Doctor needs to decide who to present it to. Oh, and of course everyone is threatening to kill the Doctor and his companions if they do not do what they are told.    The Doctor is not as forceful in this story as in later ones, at times Ian leads the group, although eventually the Doctor always ends up back in command.

Then there is the evil intelligence (the Mandragora) the Doctor has unwittingly brought with him. Its goal is (of course) to rule the universe.    The Doctor is aided by Sarah in this one, which takes place in Italy in 1492. No mention of Columbus though :) I found the political plot to be a bit distracting at times, it seemed more time was spent on it than the Mandragora. Personally I would have prefered more emphasis on the Mandragora.    All in all an OK book, and a quick read.	2005-05-28

The Doctor's companion is Leela and a local pathologist and theater manager provide the assist.

Seems to be based on the TV episode, so it stays largely with what you would see if you watched the show rather than presenting the reader with what is happening inside the character's heads. An entertaining story and I could picture the cheesy (but fun to watch) special effects of the TV show while reading it :)    The Doctor saves the world (of course) and possibly the entire galaxy/universe from an evil intelligence that uses yetis and a (very) old monk as its weapons. You have to wonder why such a great intelligence cannot come up with a better plan during the 300 years it is working on this one. I guess that's what leads to its downfall, as the Doctor's more spontaneous unplanned actions triumph over the methodically executed evil one's plan.	2005-05-17

Ace's experience is very bleak and she continues to have her doubts about the Doctor's morals and intentions. She is also confused as to why the Doctor is not explaining things to her like he used to and instead expects her to figure them out herself.    The Doctor is his normal flippant self and comes out well as usual. Benny comes out pretty well also and although she wonders about the Doctor, she is largely OK with him rather than not trusting him as Ace does.    I found a couple of the supporting cast pretty interesting as well, particularly Terrin and Raferty. The renegade Time Lord was a bit weak and the bad guy/creature was overdone (but that is not unusual in Doctor Who, nor is it necessarily a bad thing).	2005-05-04

I loved the problem the Doctor had to solve but found Ace's romance to be overly contrived. <br /> <br />A race of creatures that absorb the dead's memories is hardly a new concept, but combined with the infecting of live people and being able to see what they see, hear what they think and control their actions made for quite an adversary. Although I would have thought the Hoothi would be a bit smarter given the millions (billions?) of creature's memories they had absorbed and lives they controlled. <br /> <br />The Doctor being forced to not know what he was doing in order to hide it from the Hoothi made for an interesting plot line. However, the romance between Ace and Jan got tiring real fast as it was weakly set up and quite over the top. I loved the ending and how the Doctor beat the Hoothi, although I really should have seen it coming. It was forshadowed a number of times but I did not pick up on it until just before it actually happened.	2005-05-02
