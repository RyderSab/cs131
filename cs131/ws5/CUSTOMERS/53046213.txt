He also tries to look into the future to make out the outlines of where our newfound genetic knowledge and power may lead.<br /><br />If you're interested in a serious survey of the story of genetics starting in antiquity, before getting into the human genome and current research, this is the book for you. You'll learn a lot about embryology, about early theories of development and evolution, and about researchers and thinkers whose contributions to this field, broadly construed, you may not have known about, from Aristotle to Caspar Wolff.<br /><br />I thought the book really got interesting when it began to deal with the question of the evolution of form. How all the intricate forms that define an organism come about, in terms of evolution, genetics and embryology, remains one of the great unanswered questions of biology. Much of _Jacob's Ladder_ is shaped by Gee's fascination with this issue. His answer, that the answer will be found through understanding and modeling the structure and dynamic functioning of genetic networks, makes excellent sense.<br /><br />I also felt that Gee's speculations about what we as a species may do with our newfound ability to modify our own genes and genetic networks well thought out and provocative.<br /><br />If you would like to understand the rich soil from which the next year's or the next decade's genetic discoveries and interventions will spring, this would be an excellent place to start.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley, 2002), and _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_ (Wiley, 2004).	2005-05-09

In _Brunelleschi's Dome_, he lovingly tells the whole story of Florence's great Duomo, not just how it was conceived, designed and built, but the scrappy, dramatic life of the genius who built it, and the bubbling artistic, interpersonal and political ferment that surrounded him in Renaissance Florence.<br /><br />Brunelleschi emerges as a driven, arrogant, stubborn, and brilliant architect and engineer. Building the enormous dome--the largest ever constructed before the modern use of lightweight materials--without a separate support structure was truly a work of genius. King writes of Brunelleschi, \\"In his unquestionable brilliance the writers of the Renaissance found their proof that modern man was as great as--and could in fact surpass--the ancients from whom they took their inspiration.\\"<br /><br />It's a fascinating and inspiring story, lucidly told.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley, 2002), and _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_ (Wiley, 2004).	2005-05-08

It is, however, a must read for anyone concerned about our future.<br /><br />In _Collapse_, UCLA geographer Jared Diamond explores the question of \\"how societies choose to fail or succeed.\\" In the book's 560 information-packed pages, he studies societies that have disappeared, including Polynesians on Easter and Pitcairn islands, the Anasazi of the American Southwest, the Maya, and the Norse in Greenland. He also examines several current societies experiencing varying degrees of disintegration or risk -Rwanda, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, China, Australia and, surprisingly, Montana.<br /><br />Early on Diamond rejects simplistic models. He notes that many ancient societies damaged their environments, but refutes that as the sole reason for societal failure. \\"There are always other contributing factors,\\" he writes. He proposes a framework of five major factors that he thinks apply in almost every case--environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, over-dependence on trade partners, and a society's response to its environmental problems. Much of the rest of the book is an extremely detailed sifting through what is known about societies that have collapsed and societies currently at risk, in the light of these factors.<br /><br />Diamond's mastery of detail is amazing. He seems to have absorbed and summarized all of the salient history, archaeology, climatology, sociology, polynology (the study of pollen grains) and just about every other source of information about each of the times and places he analyzes, down to the level of individual rulers, specific events, even individual farms.<br /><br />This wealth of detail makes for slow going, but it insulates Diamond from the pitfalls that seem to trip up many discussions of these issues. Diamond dodges political, ideological, and academic presuppositions, and instead relies on the best evidence, keen observation, and commonsense reasoning.<br /><br />Several themes emerge again and again. Deforestation cut the Easter Islanders off from the rest of Polynesia, and kept them from going to sea to fish. It also was a factor in the demise of the Anasazi in a totally different environment. Invasive plants and animals, often introduced deliberately frequently turn up as likely culprits, for example rats on Easter Island and rabbits in Australia. Many societies made maladaptive choices, often clinging to traditional values and \\"solutions,\\" that led them on to collapse.<br /><br />Diamond also shows us some of the dynamics of collapse. Many societies, it seems, fell apart within a few decades of their peak in terms of population and power. These precarious peaks were usually built on over-exploitation of their environment, aggressive subjugation of neighbors, and an increasing distance between the elite and their subjects. Warfare and rebellion often seem to have been the proximate causes of collapse, but these in turn were often caused by other factors. Problems may take centuries to reach critical levels, but once they do, the end can come quickly.<br /><br />I found Diamond's exploration of how societies adapted or failed to adapt to their challenges the most relevant to today's world. Some societies, he shows, adapted remarkably well to threats such as deforestation. One example is Japan, where a series of shoguns clearly recognized the extent to which the island had been deforested, and introduced a series of very effective measures to solve the problem. Today, despite Japan's dense population, close to 80% of the country is forested. (To be fair, Diamond also points out that Japan now leads the developed world in devouring third world forests).<br /><br />In contast, Diamond makes a convincing case that the Greenland Norse would have had a much higher chance of surviving if they had been willing to stretch their identity as European farmers to incorporate Innuit kayak-making, fishing, and whale-huntingtechniques. The Norse did not, so when a worsening climate and reduced trade stressed them, they were unable to survive.<br /><br />Incidentally, Diamond was at his best in describing Innuit technology. His description, starting on page 258, of his first encounter with a whale-hunting kayak, in which he compares it to \\"a miniature version of the long, narrow, fast battleships of the U.S.S. Iowa class . . .\\" is the most insightful and respectful appreciation of indigenous technological prowess that I've ever read. (I remember being struck by the degree to which Diamond showed similar appreciation for the intelligence and capability of indigenous and non-Western people in his Pulitzer Prize winning book, _Guns, Germs and Steel_.)<br /><br />Another point that I thought Diamond made convincingly was that it would be extremely na√Øve of us to rely on technology to save us from the risk factors that we are piling up around ourselves. While it's true that new technologies-for example the Green Revolution-may avert or delay an impending disaster, they equally often create whole new problems.<br /><br />As he brings his discussion to bear on the present, Diamond summarizes a dozen current threats: global deforestation and habitat destruction, the collapse of fisheries, loss of biodiversity, loss or destruction of soils, rapidly rising energy use, shortages of fresh water, exploitation of more than half of Earth's capacity for photosynthesis, toxic wastes, the spread of alien species, natural and human-caused climate change, and a still-burgeoning world population whose impact is multiplied by the rapidly rising standard of living in countries such as China and India.<br /><br />Still, Diamond professes to be guardedly optimistic about the future. He believes that we have the capacity to solve our problems and avert the disasters that have befallen many previous cultures and civilizations. But if and only if we recognize the problems and work together rationally, pragmatically, and promptly to solve them.<br /><br />He offers as a model the Netherlands, twenty percent of which is below sea level, in the form of dike-protected fields called polders. \\" . . . we're all down in the polders together,\\" Diamond quotes one of his Dutch friends as saying. \\"If the dikes and pumps fail, we'll all drown together.\\"<br /><br />Diamond's bottom line? \\"Because we are the cause of our environmental problems, we are the ones in control of them, and we can choose or not choose to stop causing them and start solving them.\\"<br /><br />I have an idea.

Still, Bartusiak tells a very important story in great detail. She clearly did her homework; the book is full of the kind of details that come only from visiting sites and interviewing key players face-to-face.<br /><br />I thought that the most important point Bartusiak made did not come until at least two-thirds of the way through the book. She finally made it clear that the key problem in detecting gravitational waves rippling through spacetime is isolating the detector from every other influence, insulating and quieting it to the point that a change in length no larger than a fraction of the diameter of an atom can be detected. That's why, when gravitational waves are finally detected, it will be a great technical triumph as well as a vindication of Einstein's theory and a powerful new window on the universe.<br /><br />On the whole I'd describe Bartusiak's writing as clear and well organized, but not inspiring. However, she did come up with one delightful metaphor. In describing the impending collision of two black holes, one of the predicted sources of detectable ripples in spacetime, she wrote, \\"Picture two black holes slowly circling each other, like a pair of sumo wrestlers warily checking each other out in the ring.\\" I would have liked the book even more if Bartusiak had provided more imaginative writing like that, and more science as well.<br /><br />Still, if you want to know what the first detection of gravitational waves will mean, and the enormous amount of effort that has gone into this impending discovery, _Einstein's Unfinished Symphony_ is well worth reading.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley & Sons, 2002); and _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_ (Wiley & Sons, 2004).r /><br />Still, if you want to know what the first detection of gravitational waves will mean, and the enormous amount of effort that has gone into this impending discovery, _Einstein's Unfinished Symphony_ is well worth reading.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley & Sons, 2002); and _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_ (Wiley & Sons, 2004).	2004-12-31

This is not surprising, since it was his painstaking and persistent analysis of magnetic monopole production in grand unified theories that led him, step by step, to one of the great breakthroughs of 20th-century science, the discovery of the cosmic inflation that conjured our universe out of a speck of vacuum far smaller than a proton.<br /><br />Guth's systematic, thorough qualities come through in _The Inflationary Universe_, his 1997 history of the discovery of inflation. He starts at the beginning, with the principles of conservation, Newtonian and relativistic views of space, time, matter and gravity, quantum theory, the discovery of the expanding universe, etc. It's not until Chapter 10, 167 pages into the book, that Guth starts to explain inflation.<br /><br />It's well worth the wait. I found his explanations thoughtful and lucid. For readers who want more detail, he provides even more thorough explanatory footnotes, endnotes, a very helpful glossary, and appendices on why the energy of a gravitational field is negative, Newton's idea of an infinite static universe, blackbody radiation, and units and measures.<br /><br />Of course the book is now eight years old. Guth mentions the possibility that the rate of expansion of the universe is speeding up, which we now know to be the case from observations that came out a year or two after his book. And he just touches on string theories.<br /><br />On the other hand, Guth's speculations at the end of the book on the existence of an infinite number of universes, and on the possibility that a super-advanced technology could be used to create new universes, are as clear, convincing and mind-bending as any I've read.<br /><br />Anyone who takes the time to read the entire book will come away with a very solid and authoritative understanding of the development of modern cosmology from its roots to the current bouquet of inflationary theories.<br /><br />I recommend it strongly to readers who want a deeper understanding of cosmology, both in terms of the history of the field, and the underlying physics.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley, 2002); and _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_ (Wiley, 2004).ories. <br /> <br />I recommend it strongly to readers who want a deeper understanding of cosmology, both in terms of the history of the field, and the underlying physics. <br /> <br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley, 2002); and _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_ (Wiley, 2004). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-12

That's the point he systematically develops and demonstrates in this short book.<br /><br />I found the book balanced, clear and convincing. If anything, I felt it was overly diplomatic and balanced--just the kind of nuanced thinking that hawks love to bash. I can just hear the neocons chortling about the very idea of soft power.<br /><br />At the very end of the book, Nye writes, \\"In short, America's success will depend upon our developing a better balance of hard and soft power in our foreign policy.

Much to my surprise, this fresh approach to Einstein by science writers Karen Fox and Aries Keck really works. It helps that every entry is well researched and sparkingly written, but even the inevitable repetitions turn out to be helpful, often reinforcing an important idea or presenting it from a different angle. I read the book from beginning to end on a long airplane trip, and found it as enjoyable and engrossing as any book I've read recently.<br /><br />Even though I've read many books about Einstein, and written a chapter about him in my book _Science Firsts_, I found quite a lot in _Einstein A to Z_ that was new to me. For example, I did not know that the German army was aware of the possibility of an atomic bomb as early as 1924, or how intensely Einstein was monitored by the FBI from 1932 on, or that Life magazine once labelled Einstein a Communist dupe or fellow traveller. I also thought the authors did a great job of tracing the evolution of Einstein's philosophical thoughts about science, from a very hard-nosed version of Mach's positivism (physics should deal only with observables) that guided his earliest work to a view that embraced the necessity of hypothesizing intangibles such as the gravitational field.<br /><br />My only quibble with the authors was what I felt was their somewhat apologetic depiction of Einstein's lifelong battle against political repression wherever her encountered it. This was as central to Einstein as his science. He was outspoken in his battles against fascism and anti-Semitism in Germany, McCarthyism in the U.S., the nuclear arms race, and excessive nationalism wherever he saw it, including, as the authors point out, in Israel. His political views may or may not play well in America today, but they certainly don't need to be apologized for.<br /><br />I don't think Einstein A to Z should be the only book about Einstein a person reads, but it certainly can hold its own with the more traditionally organized biographies.

Barry has done a phenomenal amount of research into how medical science, governments, and society at large dealt with the incredibly deadly worldwinde influenza epidemic that started in 1918. As Barry points out, that particularly virulent version of the influenza virus killed more people in six months than HIV/AIDS has killed since it first appeared. It's impact on society was enormous, and yet it was sytematically minimized and forgotten.<br /><br />As has happended many times in history, this epidemic hit and exploded during wartime. Barry details how the U.S. government under Wilson refused to acknowledge the epidemic because it might interfere with the war effort. With this model, many local governments also refused to come to grips with the reality and enormity of the epidemic, leading to needless death and chaos.<br /><br />As the headlines consistently alert us, we live in a world where the next epidemic, whether started by accident in a crowded food market in China or through an act of bioterrorism, could hit at any time. If we are not to repeat the mindless denial and needless chaos of the past, we need to know and understand the relevant history. For that, The Great Influenza is the right medicine at the right time.	2004-10-04

I picked it up with some hesitation because many such collections, even by thinkers as brilliant as Dawkins, fail to hang together or turn out to be dated. Dawkins dodges both of these pitfalls. He organizes the pieces into six meaninful sections, and since most of the essays explore deep and important issues in evolution, biology or science itself, they remain timely.<br /><br />Early in the book Dawkins repeates Dobzhansky's famous quote, \\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\\" It's that light that pervades most of these essays, as it does most of Dawkins' work. I especially liked his skewering of genetic determinism based on the fact that the genome of an organism is not a blueprint but a recipe. As Dawkins puts it, an engineer can work backwards from a building to its blueprint, but there's no unique path back from an organism to its genes.<br /><br />In this volume Dawkins also takes on broader issues, such as faith vs. science, and the postmodern reduction of all ideas to the same level. His views on these subjects are clear, uncompromising, and well worth reading.<br /><br />His writing is always clear and sometimes beautiful. Here's one of his fine passages: \\"The human mind is a wanton storyteller and, even more, a profligate seeker after pattern.

In the past year we've read about SARS appearing in China and jumping to cities around the world, about Mad Cow disease showing up here in the U.S., in Canada and in Japan, about the threat of a global flu epidemic, and of course we're all aware of the vast AIDS epidemic which continues to penetrate new populations in the industrialized world and which is devastating much of Africa.<br /><br />Veterinarian Mark Walters does a very readable job of discerning a common thread that ties together these and other modern plaques. He demonstrates that they are not simply random natural events, but are all intimately tied to human activities. The strange infectious proteins that cause Mad Cow disease would not have created an epidemic if farmers hadn't gotten used to feeding cattle the ground-up by-products of other cows. HIV almost certainly spread from a primate reservoir to humans through the butchering and ingestion of bush meat, a growing practice that could easily be the source of future plagues. The deadly bacteria that are becoming increasing resistant to our armamentarium of antibiotics are goaded along this path by the use of enormous quantities of antibiotics in raising animals. Walters traces similar human factors for Lyme Disease, Hantavirus and the West Nile virus.<br /><br />Readers who are interested in the plagues that have shaped human history, or in emerging diseases that have the potential to decimate the world today or in the near future will need to go beyond Walters' brief book. Still, I found it a helpful reminder of the extent to which we humans are influencing the course of events, even seemingly natural events like the outbreaks of new diseases. The more aware we are of the impacts of our activities, the more likely we are to be willing to modify them.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome; and Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation.crates to the Human Genome; and Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation.	2004-09-21

Robinson puts a huge amount of energy into developing strong, interesting characters, both men and women, and into taking them and the reader into an entirely believable world just a touch farther into the zone of dramatic climate change than we are today. In the end, the complex, true-to-life characters won me over. Robinson also does a great job of describing how scientific research takes place and science policy is made.

Jim Garrison's strikingly clear message is that the U.S. is at a historical crossroads. Like it or not, we have become an empire, the most powerful the world has ever known. How we handle that role will make an enormous difference to our own prosperity, security and future, and to the rest of the world.<br /><br />Garrison argues convincingly that our current foreign policy, typified by unilateral military interventions, ad-hoc \\"coalitions of the willing,\\" and devaluation of international law, international accords, and international organizations such as NATO and the UN, is dangerously misguided. He shows that even though our military power is enormously greater than any current or likely adversary, reliance on military power alone cannot solve the global problems that spawn failed states, violent extremism, and terrorism.<br /><br />Instead, he advocates that the U.S. needs a \\"transcendental vision\\" of itself as the last empire, a transitional empire that steers the world toward an era of global good governance. He argues that we should have a much more balanced approach based on what he sees as all three main themes of our history--democracy, market capitalism, and our view of ourselves as destined to bring the light of freedom to the world. He feels that this vision led the U.S. to create the League of Nations after WWI, the United Nations, NATO, and other great international institutions after WWII, and should guide us now to stabilize the world not only through our military might, but also by creating and fostering new and better forms of international cooperation and governance.<br /><br />I feel that Garrison has a lot to say that both liberals and conservatives need to hear. He makes it clear to the left that the world is in a state of crisis that requires forceful U.S. leadership backed up by the willingness to intervene militarily when and where needed. But he also makes it clear to the right that relying only or primarily on our military power, without building strong and wise international institutions, will lead to disaster.<br /><br />I found this book extremely clear, very well written, highly informative, and thought-provoking.<br /><br />I think that every concerned citizen should read it, and only hope that our leaders will read it too.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome; and Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creationhout building strong and wise international institutions, will lead to disaster. <br /> <br />I found this book extremely clear, very well written, highly informative, and thought-provoking. <br /> <br />I think that every concerned citizen should read it, and only hope that our leaders will read it too. <br /> <br />Robert Adler, author of _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome; and Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation	2004-09-10

My sense is that in this book, he presents so much so briefly that the most important themes remain undeveloped.<br /><br />The doom-and-gloom title only tells part of the story. Rees summarizes the many threats to our civilization, the biosphere, and even to the cosmos as a whole. These risks stem from natural events such as asteroids, comets, or super-massive volcanic eruptions, but even more from human activities. Rees does a good job of reminding us that science and technology are giving individuals, whatever their motivations, access to more and more power. It won't be long before a terrorist group or a Unibomber-type individual could cause enormous destruction, for example by unleashing homemade bioweapons. Other risks come from scientists heedlessly pushing the envelope of fields such as nanotechnology. The cumulative risk, Rees argures, has never been greater, not even during the depths of the cold war.<br /><br />Still, Rees provides some hope. He advocates a renewed thrust into space, with the idea of establishing self-sufficient groups of humans (or our \\"descendants\\" in the form of intelligent machines) away from Earth, where even an Earth-destroying disaster would not bring human (and posthuman) history to a crashing stop.<br /><br />These are important themes, which Rees backs up by brief references to those who have gone more deeply into them than he has.<br /><br />I would have felt more satisfied by Our Final Hour if Rees had taken the time to go more deeply into his most important points himself.<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of Scence Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation; and Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome	2004-09-03

But that's what Bodanis has done, by tracing the history of each of the five symbols in the equation E = mc(2). Then Bodanis traces some of the implications of Einstein's work, from the Bomb to Black Holes.<br /><br />Readers who are primarily interested in the personalities and dramas of science may like this book better than those interested in the science itself. Bodanis made a deliberate decision to keep the scientific content of the main part of the book light (too light for my taste), but then to put more meat into his extensive notes and web site.

This is a difference that makes a difference. Modern medicine understands, can quickly detect, and can effectively treat outbreaks of bubonic plaque, making a major re-emergence very unlikely. But if the mysterious virus behind the Black Death, or a close cousin, were to re-emerge, the results could be catastrophic, as the authors clearly show.<br /><br />The authors reached this conclusion through patient sleuthing through ancient death records in towns and villages devastated by the Black Death. By tracing the exact lines of transmission, they were able to show that the virus had a long incubation period, during most of which people acted as unknowing carriers of the disease. By the time they developed its horrifying symptoms, it was too late for them and for those people they had crossed paths with.<br /><br />Perhaps because the authors' historical research was so important in guiding them to their radical new conclusion, they devote the first half of the book to it. Readers who make it through this sometimes repetitious recitation will find the second half of the book much more rewarding and thought-provoking<br /><br />Robert Adler, author of Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome; and Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation	2004-08-17

I was especially eager to read Timeline because I had just returned from the Perigord, the region in France where most of the action in Crichton's time-travel book takes place. I had toured the grim castles and fortified towns he describes, and canoed down the exact stretch of the Dordogne that's at the heart of the book. I found that Chrichton was able to bring the medieval period vividly to life, far better than I'd been able to do as I toured the area. As usual, Crichton provides enough of a believable scientific basis for his story to allow an easy suspension of disbelief. I was even more impressed by the amount of research he did to be able to paint such a clear and convincing picture of the area in the mid 14th century. OK, his characters do get into one scrape after another, and help manages to arrive just in the nick of time. But the book still kept me turning the pages late into the night.

After reading Kelly Brownell's factual, rational and well-balanced book about the food industry and the American obesity crisis, I came away with the realization that basically the food industry is determined to turn all of us into foie gras. As Brownell, Director of the Yale Center for Eating and Weight Disorders, and co-author Katherine Horgen methodically demonstrate, the now global epidemic of obesity is anything but a lonely individual battle against overeating. Instead, we are victims of a host of factors that tip the scales dramatically against all of us: supersizing, saturation advertising from infancy on, aggressive lobbying, fast food and sugar-laden soft drinks in schools, the high cost and difficulty of finding healthy foods, plus all the factors that keep us sitting passively rather than exercising. It's a public health problem of enormous size, and as Brownell and Horgen consistently point out, it requires a political and environmental solution.<br />While the authors back up their argument with authoritative research, statistics and analysis, I was most struck by some of the details they reported: baby bottles with soft-drink logos, Ronald McDonald's 100% recognition rate among American children, the 70% of eight-year-olds who rate fast foods as healthier than home cooking, the fact that feeding a family with healthy food costs 50% more than with junk food, that many &quot;servings&quot; are up to seven times larger than those the USDA statistics on fat, carbohydrates and calories are based on, and, as has been widely reported, the projection that the current generation of overfed, under-exercised, diabetes-and-heart-disease-prone children may be the first in recent history to live shorter lives than their parents and grandparents.<br />We Americans are used to tackling challenges and problems individually. In many cases, that's a great quality. But when an entire generation is being supersized, with enormous impacts on health and well-being, we need a different approach. Brownell and Horgen spend the last third of the book developing a coherent, thoughtful and much-needed societal approach to the obesity epidemic.<br />If you want to understand why this public-health epidemic has burgeoned now, and what we as a society can do about it, _Food Fight_ is the place to start.<br />Robert Adler, Ph.D., author of _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome (John Wiley &amp; Sons, March 2004).a different approach.

One group of scientists warns of significant, potentially devastating human-caused warming in the next half century, but a week later another group says that any changes that may have occurred in the 20th century were caused by natural factors, so not to worry.<br />If you want to understand what scientists really do and don't know about climate change, and how they have arrived at their present understanding of Earth's climate and the human and natural forces that are changing it, then read The Discovery of Global Warming. It's authoritative, based on more than 1000 peer-reviewed studies; clearly, even elegantly written; and is guaranteed to remain up to date through an affiliated website.<br />The author, Spencer Weart, traces the history of climate studies back to 1896, when Svante Arrhenius broke with the assumption that Earth's climate was stable over the long run and made the first scientific estimates of how much different levels of carbon dioxide would heat or cool the atmosphere. Over the course of the 20th Century, scientists gradually decoded the history of the ice ages, and came to realize that Earth's climate has changed radically many times. More recently, precision measurements form ice cores, lake beds and cave deposits have shown that the climate can change extremely quickly. For example, ice cores from Greenland show episodes of warming by seven degrees C.--close to 13 degrees F.-within five to ten years.<br />Since the 1970s, Weart reports, models of Earth's climate have grown from simple paper-and-pencil calculations to enormously complex computer simulations that take into account solar cycles, greenhouse gases, changes caused by wobbles in Earth's orbit around the sun, particles suspended in the atmosphere, ocean circulation, vegetation, Arctic and Antarctic ice, etc. The most sophisticated models are now able to simulate past climate changes, seasonal patterns and regional differences remarkably well. That gives their predictions of how the climate is likely to change over the next century as we continue to pump greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere considerable and increasing validity.<br />Weart also does a great job presenting the limitations of science in dealing with the complexities of Earth's climate. He acknowledges that scientists will never be able to prove that human activities are warming and potentially destabilizing the climate, but goes on to point out that the increasingly meaningful provisional answers they are providing are crucial to our decision making. He notes that most of the studies that pushed the field forward were wrong in one way or another, yet, cumulatively, they have created a deeper and more useful understanding of how the climate system works. He also discusses the major critics of global warming, and points out the inadequacies in their arguments and obvious sources of bias, for example being funded by corporations with a vested interest in being able to continue to pump unlimited quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.<br />Weart's bottom line is that by the middle of this century, due primarily to human activities, Earth's climate will almost certainly be 1.5 to 5.5 degrees C. (3 to 10 degrees F.) warmer on average. Changes will be greater in certain regions, for example at higher latitudes and altitudes, and will impact different ecosystems in very different ways. There may be a thriving wine industry in England, for example, while some low-lying Pacific island nations may no longer be habitable. He points out that all of human history has taken place in the most stable patch of climate in the past 400,000 years. We simply don't know how resilient our political, financial and cultural systems will be in the face of this degree of change. And, there's a wild card--the potential for far more sudden and drastic changes, for example if melting arctic iceturns off the oceanic &quot;conveyor belt&quot; that warms most of Europe. One scientist compares oceanic circulation to a &quot;capricious beast&quot; that we are &quot;poking with a stick.&quot;<br />If you're like me, by the time you've read the Discovery of Global Warming, you'll agree with Weart's conclusion: &quot;Our response to the threat of global warming will affect our personal well-being, the evolution of human society, indeed all life on our planet.&quot;  It would be great if America were leading the way toward dealing with this crisis rather than sandbagging the international effort to do something about it.<br />Robert Adler, Ph.D., author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation; and Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome, both published by John Wiley &amp; Sons.turns off the oceanic &quot;conveyor belt&quot; that warms most of Europe.

The headline makes it clear why we need more people like Devra Davis and more books like When Smoke Ran Like Water: Tales of Environmental Deception and the Battle Against Pollution.<br />Davis, who holds a masters degree in public health, is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, an adviser to the World Health Organization, and an original researcher into the impacts of air pollution on health worldwide. When Smoke Ran Like Water is her personal take on how letting businesses dump toxins into the air people breathe and the water they drink has resulted in illness-racked lives and hundreds of thousands of deaths throughout history. The story gets personal when she describes the clot of industrial pollution that settled over her hometown of Donora, Pennsylvania on October 26, 1948, sickening half the town and killing eighteen people outright. Like the deadly smogs that killed 12,000 people in London in 1952, the Donora deaths were swept under the carpet by officials; keeping the factories running was deemed far more important than a few \\"extra\\" deaths.<br />The really shocking point Davis makes, however, is that such dramatic events represent just a tiny fraction of the illness, disability, and premature death caused by the long-term impact of chronic air pollution. Although the physician-philosopher Maimonaides warned of the health effects of breathing polluted air 800 years ago, it was not until the 1970s that epidemiologists convincingly proved that even low levels of pollution cause measurable increases in illness and premature deaths. By now they can pin it down to a deadly equation-whenever air pollution increases by so many millionths of a gram per cubic meter of air, there will be so many premature deaths. The numbers are staggering-Davis reports that air pollution has caused one million early deaths in the United States since 1980, and in China causes an estimated one million early deaths each year. Equally alarming are the increasing presence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in air and water, with documented impacts on human reproduction and development.<br />Davis also details how major corporations have fought-and, as the headlines show, continue to fight--to be allowed to pollute. They have blocked legitimate research, funded biased research, and used every tactic including intimidating researchers to keep the public from understanding the impact of pollution. They've smeared even the most careful and reputable research, published in leading, peer-reviewed scientific journals, as \\"junk science,\\" and continue to lobby, with mounting success, for the right to continue to pump thousands of tons of chemicals into the atmosphere.<br />Davis, of course, provides far more scientific and historical details, and tells many fascinating stories, as she traces the battle over the air we breathe up to the present. The book is vividly written and involved me both intellectually and emotionally from the first page to the last. If you care about the health of children, older people, and future generations, or simply want to know what's really going on in the wars between those who want to pollute our environment and those who want to protect it, When Smoke Ran Like Water is a great place to start.<br />Robert Adler, Ph.D...r pollution increases by so many millionths of a gram per cubic meter of air, there will be so many premature deaths.

Economists and investors try to understand why markets crash, seismologists struggle to understand and predict great earthquakes, and historians speculate why empires crumble and global cataclysms such as the First and Second World Wars occur.<br />Physicist and science journalist Mark Buchanan brings the science of what he calls &quot;historical physics&quot;--the study of systems that are far from equilibrium and, as he puts it poised &quot;on the knife edge of instability&quot; to bear on these questions.<br />He describes a much-studied model of such catastrophe-prone systems, a simple sandpile. Build a sandpile by dropping one grain at a time on the top of the heap. It will eventually reach a critical state at which a grain can either make the pile a bit taller or start an avalanche, small or large. Scientists experimenting with real and virtual sandpiles have observed several important regularities:<br />1. The time between avalanches is extremely variable, making it essentially impossible to predict when the next avalanche will occur.<br />2. The size of avalanches is also extremely variable, making it essentially impossible to predict whether the next avalanche will be tiny or huge.<br />3. A big avalanche doesn't need a big cause; one grain can trigger a sandpile-flattening event.<br />4. Avalanche sizes follow what mathematicians call a power law. What that means is that large events happen less frequently than small ones according to a fixed ratio. For sandpiles the frequency goes down by a factor of 2.14 for each doubling of avalanche size. For earthquakes the frequency goes down by a factor of four for each doubling of released energy.<br />5. Any process that follows a power law shows two key features. The events are &quot;scale invariant,&quot; meaning that no particular size of event is favored. And large events--big avalanches, 8.0 earthquakes, &quot;1000-year floods&quot; and many other kinds of catastrophic events occur far more frequently than common sense would suggest.<br />We tend to assume that events distribute themselves along the familiar normal curve--like height, weight, IQ scores, etc. These distributions do have a favored scale--most people cluster around the average height, weight, or IQ, while the number of people with extremely low or extremely high scores is very small.<br />Buchanan shows that many events that greatly impact our lives represent changes in sandpile-like systems, and so are not just hard to predict, but inherently unpredictable. The one thing that can be predicted is that huge events will occur far more often than our intuition prepares us for.<br />Many natural events follow power laws, including earthquakes, forest fires, floods and the mass extinctions that have punctuated the history of life on earth. And many human events also show these regularities, including traffic jams, market crashes, the collapse of nations and empires, and wars.<br />Buchanan's presentation of these regularities and their implications is well reasoned, well documented and well written. Read it for yourself, and see if the ideas he presents don't help you to understand what seems to be a profound pattern that underlies many of the events that shape and shake our lives.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation  (Wiley &amp; Sons, September 2002).ds&quot; and many other kinds of catastrophic events occur far more frequently than common sense would suggest.<br />We tend to assume that events distribute themselves along the familiar normal curve--like height, weight, IQ scores, etc. These distributions do have a favored scale--most people cluster around the average height, weight, or IQ, while the number of people with extremely low or extremely high scores is very small.<br />Buchanan shows that many events that greatly impact our lives represent changes in sandpile-like systems, and so are not just hard to predict, but inherently unpredictable.

So it's no surprise that she's turned out an excellent book on the anthrax attack that followed on the heels of 9/11. Her book is based on dozens of interviews and reams of documentation. It's very detailed, remarkably clear, and extremely informative. Reading it, you would think that the author had been there with a videocamera to record each event as it unfolded.<br />A few eye-openers from the book:<br />Prior to 1972, the U.S. government made (and eventually destroyed) 220 lbs. of weapons-grade anthrax. If dispersed throughout a big city, that's enough to cause 250,000 infections and perhaps 200,000 deaths. The Soviets made (and hopefully destroyed) much more.<br />The contrast between how authorities at all levels dealt with the contamination of the Senate Office Building and the threat to Senators and their staffers, compared to postal facilities and postal workers could not be more striking. This was not simply the case of one oversight or mistake, but of a system-wide reluctance to conceive of a significant risk to postal workers (two of whom died) or to contemplate closing down potentially contaminated processing facilities.<br />As has been shown in similar situations, such as the first appearance of West Nile Virus, so many government agencies get involved that any kind of coherent response seems to take far too long, if it comes together at all.<br />Despite years of warnings, laboratories, hospitals, doctors, police plus other agencies and facilities were \\"uniformly unprepared.\\"<br />Early on, the government blocked the Centers for Disease Control from releasing information, leading to a major credibility gap.<br />The CDC's performance was far from ideal. Despite or perhaps because of their expertise, they remained convinced that there could be no risk to postal workers, and clung to the standard (and usually sensible) medical reluctance not to prescribe antibiotics far too long, especially in the case of potentially exposed postal workers.<br />As Thompson points out, we now are painfully aware that bioterrorism is a reality. Anyone who is interested in the details of how the anthrax attacks unfolded, or who wants to be better prepared the next time bioterrorists strike, should read _The Killer Strain_.<br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_  (John Wiley & Sons, September 2002).too long, especially in the case of potentially exposed postal workers.<br />As Thompson points out, we now are painfully aware that bioterrorism is a reality.

Jerry Ellis seeks his truths on foot, on long, mostly solitary walks on trails laden with personal and historical meaning. In his 1991 book _Walking the Trail: One Man's Journey Along the Cherokee Trail of Tears_, he traced the deadly march that his Cherokee ancestors were forced to make, and in the process deepened his connection with them and their world. In his newest book, _Walking to Canterbury_, he sets off to rediscover his English roots by retracing the 60-mile path from London to Canterbury walked by thousands of pilgrims in medieval times, and immortalized in Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_.<br />I found _Walking to Canterbury_ captivating. From the start, it's clear that Ellis' quest is both personal and spiritual. Through his eyes, the English landscape becomes vividly alive, small events such as finding a scallop shell lost by some long-dead pilgrim take on deep significance, and every encounter is charged with psychological depth and spiritual meaning. Anyone who seeks or has experienced moments of great clarity and connectedness will recognize the place Ellis writes from, and admire his ability to snare some of that ineffable and evanescent magic and share it with his readers.<br />Ellis also does a seamless job of weaving a great deal of history into his narrative. Along the way we not only learn a lot about Ellis and the people who share bits and pieces of his journey with him, but many fascinating details about how people in medieval England lived, loved, and saw the world a millenium ago.<br />As storytellers have known at least since Homer's time, a journey is a ripping good way to tell a story, and a natural, perhaps primal metaphor for life itself. In _Walking to Canterbury_, Ellis proves himself both a gifted storyteller and a worthy guide.<br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (John Wiley & Sons, September 2002).September 2002).	2003-06-09

Most of these popularizations make sense, as far as they go. But it was only when I came across Brian Greene's _The Elegant Universe_ that I began to grasp the full context and meaning of string theory.<br />Greene's book is a gift. With remarkable patience, he leads the reader through the development of relativity and quantum theory as the necessary precursors to string theory. With equal patience and mastery, he presents the discovery and development of string theory in all its exotic depth. I think it's remarkable that Greene, a professor of physics at Columbia University and a major contributor to string theory, would have taken the time and made the effort to present this complex and challenging field to the public with so much care and clarity.<br />The next time I come across an article about supersymmetry, 11-dimensional space, curled-up dimensions, Calabi-Yau space, or M-theory, I'll finally have a clear idea of what's being talked about, or at least know where to turn for a crystal-clear explanation.<br />With hundreds of mathematicians, physicists and cosmologists ardently trying to explain the universe through string theory, it appears that the most profound breakthroughs of the 21st century will be, as Greene puts it, \\"tied up with string.\\" _The Elegant Universe_ provides the key to understanding what's to come...	2003-05-23

The book jacket presents it as a story of the 10,000-year-long encounter between the Neanderthals and our own Cro-Magnon ancestors, a story that ends with the disappearance of the Neanderthals some 27,000 years ago. Arsuaga discusses that epochal culture clash at length and with many fresh insights. However, he weaves that narrative into a much grander story--his expert take on the evolution not just of the Neanderthals and our own very young species, but of all the other walking primates that preceded us back to whatever great-grandparent species we shared with organutangs, gorillas and chimpanzees some 6 million years ago. For good measure, Arsuaga throws in his original and highly readable takes on many key evolutionary issues, on the nature of consciousness, and--really the theme of the book--on when, where and how our own \\"hypersymbolic\\" human consciousness emerged.<br />Arsuaga, a leading Spanish paleoanthropologist, has strong views on many topics. He's convinced that modern humans are unique. \\"Anatomically, we are but erect primates . . .\\" he argues. \\"At the same time, we humans are radically different from all other animals due to the astonishing phenomena of our intelligence, our capacity for reflection, and a broad self-consciousness of all aspects of our behavior.\\" Accordingly, he denies consciousness, at least as he defines it, not only to non-human animals, but even to many of the upright, tool-using species that preceded us. \\" . . . animals lack both self-awareness and perceptive awareness, or consciousness. They are no more than biological machines.\\" (Immediately after this hackle-raising statement, Arsuaga is perceptive enough to apologize \\"to all cat- and dog-lovers,\\" whose beloved pets, he concedes, may possibly have \\"perceptive consciousness.\\")<br />After in-depth discussions of almost every line of evidence, Arsuaga comes to several very interesting conclusions about the development of the fully human consciousness he so highly values. Surprisingly, he grants first membership in the consciousness club to a truly ancient ancestor, _Homo ergaster_, whose 1.8 million-year-old fossils have been found in modern-day Kenya. Not only did _H. ergaster_ have a body closer in size and shape to our own, but a brain that was a significant chunk larger than our first tool-using ancestor, _Homo habilis_. Unlike _habilis_, _ergaster_ fashioned biface stone tools--\\"chipped on two surfaces with obvious skill and concern for symmetry. \\"These primitive human beings were conscious of what they were doing, and they cared about the tools they carried in their hands,\\" Arsuaga writes.<br />Like most current researchers, Arsuaga is clear that Neanderthal's were not our direct ancestors, but a relatively recent, parallel, and ultimately extinct human branch. Still, he grants them a mental world nearly equal to our own. After all, he points out, they made tools just as carefully as their archaic human neighbors, made fire, and buried their dead. Still, he concludes from anatomical studies that they could not produce fully articulated speech, and that they never entered the richly symbolic world that we inhabit (with rare exceptions such as the necklace-wearing Neanderthal referred to in the book's title). Arsuaga focuses on two clues to this consciousness gap. It was the Cro-magnons some 32,000 years ago who began to represent the world they saw and imagined in those haunting cave paintings, and who devoted enormous amounts of time and effort to personal adornment. That's when, he writes poetically, \\"the world was made transparent.\\" By that he means that with their newly re-tooled minds, our immediate ancestors projected all their intuitive understanding of each other, all of their deep immersion into symbols, onto the entire world.  \\"All of a sudden and unexpectedly,\\" he writes,  \\"the spirit of our land, old _Europa_, came alive. The rocks, the rivers, the sea, the trees, and the animals, also the clouds, the sun, the moon, and the stars above; all sang to humankind, and the wind carried their song.\\"<br />It's a lovely summary of a lovely and deeply informative book. Anyone who is interested in a well written, well thought out and non-standard view of how we came to be the way we are will enjoy it thoroughly.<br />Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley, Sept. 2002), presenting highlights in the history of science from the ancient Greeks to the cloning of Dolly the Sheep.n and unexpectedly,\\" he writes,  \\"the spirit of our land, old _Europa_, came alive.

US	53046213	RK5KCE6OD24P3	1578261236	884846515	Secrets of the Maya	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Fascinating but flawed	I couldn't resist picking up _Secrets of the Maya_, with its intriguing title and the mysterious frieze decorating its cover. It turned out to be far from perfect, but well worth reading.<br />The book is a collection of articles about the Maya published in Archaeology magazine during the past fifteen years. The virtue of this format is that the articles provide a kind of play-by-play review of many of the major advances and changes that have taken place in our understanding of the Mayan world during this time. The major disadvantage is that a collection of articles reporting on a wide range of topics and spanning 15 years makes it very hard to piece together a coherent overview. A brief introduction by T. Patrick Culbert, emeritus professor of archaeology at the University of Arizona, helps a bit, but more was needed. Separate introductions to each of the four sections: Politics, War and Survival, Arts, Religion &amp; Culture, Reading the Maya Past, and An Endangered History would have made a big difference, as would some kind of summation to tie it all together.<br />Probably the greatest advance described in the book is the breaking of the code of the intricate glyphs that cover columns and facades throughout the Mayan world. It's obvious that the task is far from complete, with scholars still arguing over interpretations. But it's equally clear that Mayan scholars have made a great deal of progress in assembling a meaningful history of the Maya based on their written records. Other major advances include the realization that the Maya were not, as was thought earlier, a peaceful society run by otherworldly theocrats. Instead (not all that surprisingly) they emerge as a dynamic, ever-changing grab-bag of city-states. They forged and broke alliances, warred with each other, exploited, changed and eventually degraded their environment, and, like the Aztecs, had their own set of strange and bloody customs. More recently, we learn, archaeologists and governments have had to try to deal with the ravages of widespread looting, and archaeologists have been attacked by armed bands intent on keeping the ruins to themselves. To their credit, at least a few Mayan scholars have begun to collaborate with Mayans living today, not just to help find or excavate sites, but to help the researchers understand and interpret what they find, as guides into the Mayan worldview, and to tap into their traditional knowledge of the medicinal properties of more than 200 species of plants.<br />Secrets of the Maya does have one glaring flaw--its almost total lack of illustrations. The book contains some small maps, one or two photos of archaeologists, and just nine other fairly unimpressive plates. When I have toured Maya sites, I've been overwhelmed by the impact of the massive structures, the power of the carvings, and the sheer beauty of the settings. I can't understand why the editors of this book decided not to include more pictures and better pictures. They could have brought what the authors were often laboring to describe to life.<br />The articles seemed to me to get better with time. I thought the best was near the end, a chapter by Tom Gidwitz featuring joint work by Culbert and two NASA scientists who used a variety of high- and low-tech approaches to surveying the swampy Mayan lowlands. They've been able to demonstrate that the ancient Maya performed enormous engineering feats to turn vast swamps into the productive farmland that was needed to support a huge population. The chapter also presents an intriguing and largely convincing history of over-exploitation of these wetlands by the Maya which may have contributed to the devastating 200-year drought that struck the entire region around 800 AD, and which clearly left the Mayan civilization extremely vulnerable to that drought.<br />The book has its strengths and weaknesses, but it certainly whetted my appetite for some of the books in its &quot;further reading&quot; list. I'm eager to findout what secrets of the Maya remain to be revealed.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Sept. 2002).out what secrets of the Maya remain to be revealed.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Sept. 2002).	2003-04-20

In The Ice Chronicles, climatologist and arctic explorer Paul Mayewski and author Frank White bring cooler heads and cold, hard facts to the controversy.<br />The book, published in the fall of 2002, centers on the findings from the two-mile long ice core that Mayewski's team pulled from the center of the Greenland Ice Cap. This ice core, labeled GISP2, allowed scientists to track a wide range of climate variables in exquisite detail over the past 100,000 years. It produced many important findings that can help clarify the highly politicized climate controversy. The core reveals that Earth's climate is far from steady. Even without any contributions from manmade greenhouse gasses, ozone-depleting chemicals or particulates, regional and global conditions have swung from hot to cold and wet to dry many times, often with dramatic suddenness. Mayewski repeatedly makes the point that the climatologically calm, benign Holocene--the time period during which human civilization appeared and has developed--is a myth. The ten millennia or so since the end of the most recent ice age have been marked by two large global climate shifts, the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period, and many less drastic but still potent changes. He also presents intriguing evidence that some of these changes contributed to the downfall of several ancient civilizations, including the Mesopotamian Empire around 1200 BC, the Mayan Civilization around 900 AD, and the Norse colonies in Greenland around 1400 AD.<br />My only real criticism of the book is that it may present more of the nitty gritty history and findings of the GISP2 project than most readers want or need. Still, most of this is put into boxes which readers can dive into or skip as they choose.<br />While the research findings and their implications are fascinating, perhaps the most important contribution the authors make is their perspective. The data Mayewksi himself uncovered show that the climate is a complicated and sensitive system, pushed from regime to regime by a variety of natural forces. But Mayewski is equally clear that human activities, most notably the marked and well-documented increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, have joined the party, and must be considered in order to understand current conditions or predict future climate change. And he is clear that unless we take sensible steps to reduce our impacts on the system, we risk not just global warming and whatever changes that would bring, but increased climactic instability and unpredictability. To the authors' credit, they attempt to bring some calm into the climate debates by propounding ten realistic, commonsense principles. The reflect that, &quot;No matter what we do, the climate will change.&quot; But they also admonish, &quot;We should strive more for climate predictability than control,&quot; and &quot;If we cannot have global control of climate policy, we must at least have global cooperation.&quot;<br />The Ice Chronicles is well worth reading, both for the hard-won scientific facts it presents and explains so clearly, and for the constructive, down-to-earth perspective it provides.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation.

Freud, he writes, made many people \\"unduly embittered about their past and unduly passive about their future,\\" while clinical psychology focussed on diagnosing and treating mental disorders. In his new book, Authentic Happiness, Seligman goes a long way towards breaking psychology free from its love affair with pathology and replacing it with a far more positive approach.<br />I don't know of anyone with better credentials to guide readers through what psychology has discovered about happiness. Seligman's own research has contributed greatly to our understanding of the entire range of human experience from profound depression to \\"abundant gratification.\\" His early, groundbreaking studies of learned helplessness provided great insight into inescapable trauma as a major source of helplessness and depression. He went on to study \\"learned optimism\\" as a powerful antidote to depression--his earlier book by that name is invaluable.<br />Now, Seligman sets out to provide readers with the insights and tools from the relatively new field of positive psychology. He does this with a rich mixture of anecdotes, personal revelations and research. In addition, he provides frequent self-assessments and exercises. I think that almost anyone who takes the time to read what Seligman has to say, who takes and thinks about the self assessments, and who does the exercises, will start thinking and acting in ways that lead to lasting happiness.<br />It's important to realize that Seligman is not a self-help guru by any stretch of the imagination. He is a leading research psychologist who builds on solid experimental findings. (Although the book is vividly written for the most part, at times Seligman's reliance on research findings slows things down.) Still, he is also devoted to the idea of making those often dry experiments as meaningful and useful as possible. He doesn't promise limitless bliss, but what he does offer may actually be reachable by ordinary, unenlightened people like us.<br />Early in the book Seligman makes the point that pleasure in itself is not the road to happiness. As we all know, pleasure is fleeting, and pursuing it can easily turn into addiction or futility. Instead Seligman identifies and values a set of nearly universal virtues which he believes lead to deep and lasting gratification. These include wisdom and knowledge, courage, love and humanity, justice, temperance, spirituality and transcendance. \\"The good life,\\" he writes, \\"is using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic happiness and abundant gratification.\\"<br />What I liked most about this book is that it made me feel good about myself, other people, and the \\"simple\\" virtues that make up much of the fabric of life, but which are often ignored and devalued. Kindness, tolerance, competence, interpersonal skills, a work ethic, and faith emerge as vital ingredients of a good, gratifying, happy life.<br />Authentic Happiness is not a miracle cure for all unhappiness. It is, however, a wise, well-informed, and extremely valuable guide to a more grounded, heartfelt and gratifying life.<br />Robert Adler, Author of _Sharing the Children: How to Resolve Custody Problems and Get on With Your Life_(1988, 2nd.

So, I was eager to dive into Robert Desowitz's interestingly titled book, Federal Bodysnatchers and the New Guinea Virus: Tales of Parasites, People and Politics. The book jacket told me that Desowitz is a leading epidemiologist and the author of four other books in the area. I was hoping to get his insider's view of epidemic or emerging diseases, what's being done about them, and the politics of drug development and distribution.<br />There was certainly some interesting information in the book. I hadn't known, for example, that the global ban on DDT that flowed from Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring inadvertently had a devastating effect on the worldwide effort to eradicate malaria. Desowitz points out that spraying DDT in the houses of people living in malaria-ridden regions was the mainstay of the eradication program, and was very successful. DDT sprayed inside houses did not contribute significantly to the thinning of birds' eggshells that was a key feature of Carson's argument, but saved the lives of millions of people. Unfortunately, this anti-malaria use of DDT was swept away along with other more destructive uses.<br />Desowitz also provided an interesting blow-by-blow description of the 1999 outbreak of West Nile Virus in New York. Given the risk of bioterrorism, it's sobering to learn that it took from May 21 to September 25 for health authorities to notice and begin to get a grip on the outbreak.

Nexus, Mark Buchanan's recent work on \\"small worlds and the groundbreaking science of networks\\" is one of the more readable and less sensational takes on the theme.<br />Buchanan, a physicist, science writer and editor at Nature and New Scientist, has the credentials to know what he is writing about and the ability to present it coherently. He starts with the now famous \\"small world\\" or \\"six degrees of separation\\" observation, first made in the 1960s and since studied and demonstrated in a variety of important, real-world networks. Buchanan's thesis is that physicists and mathematicians are discovering some remarkably simple laws that describe a huge number of complex systems, quite independently of the elements that make up the system. For example, The linkages that connect everyone in the world with just six steps can be treated the same way as the linkages that connect neurons in our brains or web pages on the internet. \\"Some of the deepest truths of our world may turn out to be truths about organization,\\" Buchanan writes, \\"rather than about what kinds of things make up the world and how these things behave as individuals.\\"<br />Building on this theme, Buchanan systematically explores areas such as the spread of infections diseases, key social and governmental systems, brain organization, protein-based control networks within our cells, and even networks of sexual partners. Similar features, especially the \\"power-law\\" distribution, characterize all these systems. Whether the issue is the number of sexual partners, the number of chemical reactions, or the number of connected neurons, a few key elements account for a large percentage of the connections within each system. Buchanan shows how this grows out of a simple common dynamic characterized by the age-old observation that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.<br />Buchanan then goes on to trace some important implications of these emerging findings. These include the vulnerability of ecosystems to sudden collaps when a few key plants or animals are lost, the explosive transformation of a slumbering pathogen into a deadly epidemic, as seen in AIDS, and--economists and would-be-reformers take notice--the distribution of wealth. Buchanan shows that, although the exact percentages vary from country to country, the shape of the wealth-distribution curve is the same. And he demonstrates that this distribution can be shown to stem from a few extremely simple assumptions. I was struck by Buchanan's observation that economic polices that foster business and trade, including regressive taxation as a kind of enforced exchange, produce a flatter, more democratic distribution of wealth. On the contrary, an environment that fosters speculation inevitably transfers wealth from the poor to the rich. It turns out that the more volatile the investment markets, the more extreme the transfer. This certainly seems to match what the U.S. experienced during the savings-and-loan bust and the recent dot-com debacle. More people riding around in limos, for sure, but far more people trying to eke out a living flipping burgers. I'd sure like to see our economists and lawmakers pay attention to that finding.<br />In short, this is a clear, readable and fascinating introduction to the emerging science of networks. Since we are made of networks, and live embedded in them, it's hard to imagine a more relevant subject. Nexus certainly doesn't supply the last word on this complex subject, but it's a rewarding place to start.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley & Sons, September, 2002).plications of these emerging findings.

However, in researching a forthcoming book, I've spent a lot of time with Tobin and Dushek's Asking About Life. It's made my life much easier.<br />As those who are familiar with Asking About Life know, this is a textbook with a philosophy. That philosophy is to present biology not as a canonical set of facts about life, but as a dynamic, ongoing dialogue with nature, in which real people who happen to be scientists ask meaningful questions and take understandable steps over time to discover answers to them. The book mixes an engaging narrative style, a strong historical perspective, great examples, and authoritative factual knowledge into an eminently readable, extremely informative, and scientifically impeccable text. As a result, a student or reader can turn to this book not simply to learn about the structure of DNA or how the human immune system functions, but also about Rosalind Franklin's role in discovering the double helix and about why HIV &quot;continues to perplex medical researchers.&quot; And, as shown by the book's section headings (How Do Zygotes Cleave? How Does Gastrulation Set Up the Three-Layered Structure?), it embodies the truth that the best scientific questions start not with &quot;what&quot; but with &quot;how.&quot;<br />Asking About Life is also full of beautiful, crystal-clear photos and illustrations, many of which, like the text, do a wonderful job of depicting not just static objects, but dynamic processes.<br />I can't imagine a better biology textbook.<br />Robert Adler, Ph.D.,author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley &amp; Sons, Sept. 2002).	2003-01-28

Also, as he predicted, I lost most of my life-long craving for high-carb treats. I followed Atkins' advice by consulting with my doctor and getting my cholesterol tested before and after the weight-loss phase of the diet. My doctor still doesn't recommend the diet, but he was very impressed with my weight loss and reduced cholesterol.<br />As Atkins recommends, I've now started to eat a few more carbs, without seeing my weight move up again. At this point, other than not eating cereal for breakfast and avoiding the obvious high-carb mains, side-dishes and desserts when I eat out, this hardly seems like a diet.<br />I'm not a doctor, and am very well aware that one case doesn't prove anything. However, if Atkins is to be believed, many thousands of people have experienced pretty much what I did. And, as recent articles in some of the major news magazines have summarized, there's a small but growing set of scientific studies that support his ideas, including a substantial study reported in the _New England Journal of Medicine_.<br />If you're interested in losing weight, I'd strongly suggest that you read this book and judge for yourself.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (John Wiley & Sons, Sept., 2002).	2003-01-23

Preston makes the reader agonizingly aware of how bitterly ironic it would be if smallpox, once humanity's greatest killer and the only disease we have managed to eradicate, is inflicted on humanity deliberately. Terribly ironic, and frighteningly likely.<br />In The Demon in the Freezer, Preston takes the reader on a vivid, intimate, insider's tour of a world very few people get to see--the sealed, pressurized, high-tech labs where space-suited scientists work with the deadliest pathogens nature has evolved (and man has tinkered with). He writes with the clarity and immediacy of someone who has traveled to every site, interviewed everyone involved, and suited up and worked with them in their labs. I didn't enjoy learning just what the autopsy of an anthrax victim reveals, or what the amputated arm of a child who died of smallpox looks like, but these and the other details Preston depicts so strikingly root what he has to say in undeniable reality. This is not a book of policy or theory, but of gory, scary reality.<br />There's nothing pretty about the picture he paints. Preston leaves no doubt that horrendously potent biological weapons exist, that the ability to use off-the-shelf genetic manipulation to make them even deadlier is widespread, and that there are plenty of people, groups, and nations with the motivation to use them. The book made me think that biological weapons will almost inevitably be used--it's just a question of when, which ones, and how well or poorly we will be prepared. In the chilling light of The Demon in the Freezer, the current resistance of healthcare providers to receiving smallpox vaccinations appears unbelievably shortsighted.<br />Concerning the eradication of smallpox through a magnificent, decade-long international effort, Preston writes eloquently, \\"No greater deed was ever done in medicine, and no better thing ever came from the human spirit.\\" Concerning the fact that politicians and scientists failed to destroy the last stashes of smallpox virus, which now leaves all of us vulnerable to its use as a weapon, he adds, \\" . . . we still held smallpox in our hands, with a grip of death that would never let it go. . . . The virus's last strategy for survival was to bewitch its host and become a source of power. We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart.\\"<br />If you want first-hand knowledge about the life-and-death issues of bioterrorism and prevention, this book is the first one to read.

Eisenhower left the presidency in 1961, he issued a famous warning: \\"In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence . . . by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic process.\\"<br />Just how prophetic Eisenhower's words were is documented in passionate clarity by Dr. Helen Caldicott in The New Nuclear Danger. She demonstrates in chilling detail how the American military-industrial complex, with the willing help of the Congress and a series of administrations, shrugged off the end of the Cold War and seized on the fallout from 9-11 to cement its hold on our government, our lives, and our futures.  The U.S. is now spending far more on the military than we were during the height of the Cold War, and much of that on new or \\"improved\\" nuclear weapons.<br />Nobody doubts that Caldicott is a fierce and passionate advocate of arms reduction, de-militarization, and of making \\"conflict resolution and peacekeeping our new priorities.\\" What gives this book enormous weight and impact is the immense amount of factual research she presents to support her views. The book is full of hard information about the giant companies that comprise the military-industrial complex, their leaders, and their financial, political and personal links with the government. It's also replete with details about the grossly expensive and enormously threatening weapons systems currently being developed, many in contravention to the arms control treaties that once seemed to give us hope of limiting or controlling the proliferation and spread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.<br />This book, more than anything I have read, makes sense of our foreign policy. If in fact Washington is as profoundly influenced by, in the pockets of, and, increasingly, advised and staffed at the highest levels by representatives of the arms industry, our aggressive stance toward the rest of the world, our apparent contempt for arms control treaties, and our go-it-alone attitude all make perfect sense.<br />One of the most worrisome points Caldicott makes is that the billions currently being spent on the \\"Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program\\" are not simply keeping our thousands of nuclear weapons in working order, but are being used for the research and development of entirely new kinds of nuclear weapons. Another is reminding us that the Bush administration's full-court-press towards its version of Star Wars is intensely destabilizing. She makes it frighteningly clear how easily our steps toward a (probably unworkable) missile defense system will be interpreted by our adversaries and even our allies as giving us a first strike capability. This, in turn, will almost certainly provoke a renewed arms race, with increased risk of mutual annihilation.<br />If you believe that the existence of increasing numbers and types of nuclear weapons, in the hands of an increasing number of nations (of decreasing stability), is the road to peace and prosperity, then you will hate this book. If, on the other hand, you are concerned about the direction the U.S. is moving in, distrust nuclear proliferation, and would like to see your children and grandchildren living in a truly safer and more secure world, then this book is an absolute must. As Caldicott concludes, \\"We cannot continue to behave as primitive animals . . . conflict resolution and peacekeeping must be our new priorities.\\"<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, Sept. 2002).at the highest levels by representatives of the arms industry, our aggressive stance toward the rest of the world, our apparent contempt for arms control treaties, and our go-it-alone attitude all make perfect sense. <br />One of the most worrisome points Caldicott makes is that the billions currently being spent on the \\"Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program\\" are not simply keeping our thousands of nuclear weapons in working order, but are being used for the research and development of entirely new kinds of nuclear weapons.

Early in her career she shocked her biological colleagues by arguing that the mitochondria that power our cells and the chloroplasts that let plants transform solar into chemical energy once were free-living bacteria. As soon as scientists could isolate and decode the scraps of DNA in those vital organelles, they found that she was right. Margulis went on to develop her Serial Endosymbiosis Theory, which attempted to trace the development of all creatures with nucleated cells, from yeasts to humans, to a series of genetic mergers between different kinds of organisms. According to Margulis, all the familiar family trees of life, which show only diverging branches, are wrong. Ancient roots and current branches cross and merge to produce new species. To Margulis, nature is far more promiscuous and much more creative than most biologists dream.<br />Her new book, Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origins of Species, extends and deepens that argument. Margulis sets out to prove that new species rarely if ever appear as the result of mutation, isolation, genetic drift, or population bottlenecks--the meat and potatoes of neo-Darwinism. Instead she maintains that the major engine of evolutionary change, the source of most of the new forms that natural selection edits, is symbiogenesis--the acquisition of whole genomes as the result of symbiotic associations between different kinds of organisms. (Knowing that some people will seize on her thesis as an attack on the theory of evolution as a whole, Margulis makes it clear that she fully supports Darwin's great discovery of the mechanism of natural selection. She simply thinks that neo-Darwinists have failed to recognize the enormous creative power of genomic mergers.)<br />Readers who are familiar with Margulis' earlier works will recognize her vivid, personal and sometimes impressionistic writing style. I found this book, co-authored by her son, Dorion Sagan, to be clear and accessible. Starting with Chapter 9, where Margulis presents her latest ideas on the symbiotic origin of the nucleus itself, things get a bit more technical. Margulis makes every effort to help readers through the thicket of important, but at times tongue-twisting terms, and supplements explanations in the text with an excellent glossary. Margulis also presents the findings of several other researchers whose work supports or relates closely to her own.<br />Readers may or may not close the book convinced that Margulis is right and the neo-Darwinists are wrong. But they will come away with a vastly deeper understanding of the pervasive nature and power of the microbial world, and of symbiosis. Margulis reveals a hidden side of nature, in which microbes have generated most if not all of life's metabolic machinery, in which vastly different life-forms consort in a myriad of ways, and in which the acquisition of entire genomes provides the raw material for great evolutionary leaps. Anyone with a deep interest in biology will gain important insights from \\"Acquiring Genomes.\\"<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley & Sons, 2002).cessible.

The author is a professor of biological sciences at British Columbia's Simon Fraser University, and clearly knows what he is writing about. He traces the history of GM crops and presents the controversies concerning them in a balanced way. That balance is both the book's strength and weakness. Winston gives the pro- and anti-GM arguments equal time, and describes them in an even-handed way. However, the absence of a strongly stated point of view made the book less interesting, at least to me. Actually, Winston does have a point of view, which he reveals towards the end of the book. He thinks that the issues swirling around GM agriculture and foods can and should be resovled with a lot less rhetoric and more reason. Given the depth of feelings on the side of people and groups opposed to GM agriculture and foods, and the amount of money at stake for companies developing and pushing them, the author's hope for reasonable solutions seems admirable, but perhaps naive. Still, if you want a factual, balanced account of the GM issue to date, this book would certainly be useful.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From The Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).	2002-12-26

The idea of this book, if I understand it, is \\"to suggest the profound link between the scientific and the spiritual\\" through the juxtaposition of beautiful pictures of \\"inner space\\"--in this case of cells, organs, and crystals--with quotes about faith, mystery and belief.<br />The book starts with a fine essay by Sharon Begley, science editor of the Wall Street Journal. She discusses the thesis that God must exist because of the perfection of the workings of nature--the famous argument from design. She presents some of the arguments for and against it with considerable balance. She also writes about the concept of \\"biological evil\\"--the implications of the existence of \\"evil\\" things such as disease-causing organisms and cancer cells. She goes on to describe brain-scanning experiments that may help explain how the brain of a meditator or Sufi dancer might create a sense of loss of self and unity with the universe. She concludes by inviting the reader to \\"see the sacred in the science of life,\\" hoping that the book's microphotographs will bring life's \\"sacred depths ... to the surface for everyone to appreciate.\\"<br />The photographs, of neurons and sperm cells, DNA molecules and chromosmes, stem cells and embryos, are remarkable and beautiful. To me they made many of the scientific findings I read about far more real. And the quotes, from spiritually minded scientists like Einstein, poets, philosophers, writers and mystics, were also beautiful. I particularly liked one from Annie Dillard. \\"The extravagent gesture is the very stuff of creation... The whole show has been on fire since the word go!\\"<br />I consider myself to be fascinated with science, and more than casually interested in the great questions that religion addresses as well. I'm as prone to feeling awe at the night sky, the grandeur of the Sierra Nevada or the inner workings of a cell as the next person. Still, for reasons I can't quite figure out, this book didn't bring those two areas any closer for me. I almost feel apologetic, as if I should have felt the awe and mystery that Begley and editor Michael Reagan set out to evoke. In the end, I found the book more puzzling than enlightening, more frustrating than inspiring.<br />It seems like such a good idea, however, that I hope it will work better for other readers than it did for me.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).e.

My knowledge of Franklin stopped with the basics--trained as a printer in colonial Boston, made his way to Philadelphia while still very young, published Poor Richard's Almanac, proved that lighting was electrical, represented the American colonies in England and newly independent America in France.<br />In slightly more than 300 elegantly written pages, Yale historian Morgan transformed this skeleton into a living, breathing man. Although Morgan based this brief history on a wealth of source documents, he tells Franklin's story effortlessly. I felt as though I had taken a long walk with a very interesting companion, and come away with a whole new understanding of a great and complex figure.<br />Morgan devotes most of the book to detailing Franklin's central role in the long series of calculations and miscalculations that pushed thirteen loyal and tractable British colonies into revolution and forged them into the United States of America. Franklin, we learn, was there at every step, usually behind the scenes, but always extremely influential, a potent catalyst to change.<br />It's as fascinating to follow the evolution of Franklin's own thoughts and feelings about the British Empire and the future of America as it is to get to catch a replay of the fateful steps in Britain and the colonies that led to the American revolution. I wish that America were blessed with more statesmen like Franklin; we could certainly use someone like him right now.<br />Just one caveat--Franklin's scientific accomplishments are mentioned, but really as a side issue. In this, Morgan seems to be following Franklin's own lead; we learn that he viewed the scientific accomplishments that won him universal acclaim as less important than his far-sighted, patient, sometimes personally costly contributions as a politician and statesman.<br />It's hard to imagine a more readable, edifying or enjoyable introduction to Benjamin Franklin.<br />Robert Adler<br />Author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).adable, edifying or enjoyable introduction to Benjamin Franklin.<br />Robert Adler<BR>Author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).	2002-12-11

The bad news is that we're losing, making the emergence of resistant disease causing bacteria \\"one of the greatest threats to the survival of the human species.\\"<br />Co-written by Mark Plotkin, a leading ethnobotanist and Michael Schnayerson, a talented writer and editor, The Killers Within is a highly readable, often gripping narrative, full of stories, personalities and drama. At the same time, it presents a lot of the history, science and politics that surround the struggle of medical science to stay a step ahead of the deadly bugs that are proving remarkably adept at evolving ways to defeat our antibiotics.<br />The authors have no trouble identifying the culprits in this losing battle--an agricultural industry pouring millions of pounds of antibiotics into poultry and livestock as \\"growth promoters,\\" doctors and patients who overuse antibiotics, and the interaction of profits and politics that determine what kinds of drugs reach the market and when. But behind these lies our naive blindness to the bacterial world's incredible capacity to defeat our most powerful weapons. Bacteria have multiple ways to evolve and swap handy genetic information, such as how to cleave penicillin molecules or pump antibiotics out of their cells. All it takes is one bacteria that survives an antibiotic by evolving a new resistance mechanism; within a few years even unrelated bacteria thousands of miles away will know the trick. It's as easy for the bacteria, the authors write, \\"as collecting charms on a charm bracelet.\\"<br />The authors chillingly describe the costs of this war being fought out in our labs, hospitals and bodies--millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, and the risk to all of us of returning to a world where we are no longer protected by antibiotics. Most of the major pathogens have already evolved multiple drug resistance.

Almost every piece is enlightening, stimulating, and remarkably well written. I read a lot of books and articles about science, but still came across dozens of new ideas, convincing arguments and sparkling insights. Here are a few items that got me thinking:<br />Physicist Lee Smolin points out that subtle changes in light waves as they cross space may provide the first test of quantum theories of gravity--we won't need to build accelerators the size of the solar system to gain this information.<br />Evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller speculates that gene activation chips will soon allow researchers to map the changes in our brains caused by &quot;every state of mind lasting more than a few hours.&quot; The result will be a far richer understanding of human consciousness.<br />Mathematician Steven Strogatz expects that new methods for creating complex, evolving systems on computers will mean that we humans will &quot;end up as bystanders, unable to follow along with the machines we've built, flabbergasted by their startling conclusions.&quot;<br />Richard Dawkins predicts that by 2050 it will cost just a few hundred dollars to sequence one's own personal genome, computers will be able to simulate an organism's entire development from its genetic code, and scientists may even be able to reconstruct extinct animals a la Jurassic Park.<br />Computer scientist Rodney Brooks thinks wars may be fought over genetic engineering and artificial enhancements that have the potential to turn humans into &quot;manipulable artifacts.&quot;<br />AI researcher Roger Schank foresees the end of schools, classrooms and teachers, to be replaced by an endless supply of virtual experiences and interactions.<br />In many cases, the bold ideas of one writer are challenged or balanced by another, making the book a kind of high-level dialogue. Cosmologist Martin Rees, for example, takes on Smolin's idea of evolving universes, and neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky is much less optimistic about our ability to conquer depression than is psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.<br />It's not all perfection, however. A few of the essays seemed relatively uninspired.  These included psychologist Paul Bloom's pessimistic view of our ability ever to understand consciousness or the nature of thought--&quot;We might be like dogs trying to understand calculus.&quot; And I found computer scientist David Gelernter's essay on the grand &quot;information beam&quot; that will transform everyone's lives an unconvincing one-note techno-fix. Also the book really needs an index--that simple addition would have made it much more useful.<br />However, it's a book that tackles big questions about our future in as thoughtful, insightful and well informed a manner as I've ever encountered.

US	53046213	R30W0DHQRVA9XV	0393020223	746851988	The Future of Spacetime	Books	5	40	41	N	N	Five fascinating pieces	I'm usually wary of books that are collections of essays, especially essays by several different people. Like many such books, The Future of Spacetime is something of a hodgepodge. Still, when I saw that the authors included Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne, Timothy Ferris, Alan Lightman and Igor Novikov, it seemed to be worth taking a look. That decision was very well rewarded.<br />The five essays in The Future of Spacetime were first presented as talks for a celebration of the 60th birthday of Kip Thorne, a leading theoretical physicist. Three of them, plus a brief introduction by physicist Richard Price, deal with relativity, and especially with the possibility and implications of &quot;closed timelike curves&quot; in spacetime--time travel for short. In addition, Tim Ferris writes insightfully about why it is so important for scientists and science writers to do a better job of informing people about scientific theories and discoveries, but even more importantly clueing them in about how science works. He points out that it may take 1,000 years for a concept to penetrate to the core of society. Since modern science is at best 500 years old, there's lots left to be accomplished. Alan Lightman, who is both a physicist and a novelist, beautifully describes the creative process that lies at the heart of both science and creative writing. Scientists and novelists, he argues, are simply seeking different kinds of truths.<br />The three physics essays are gems. Each sheds at least some light on the nature of spacetime, on the possibility (or impossibility, or improbability) of time machines and time travel, and on intimately related issues such as causality and free will. Novikov, for example, concludes that the future can influence the past, but not in such a way as to erase or change an event that has already happened. Hawking argues that time travel is happening all the time at the quantum level, but that nature would protect against an attempt to use a time machine to send a macroscopic object, such as a human being, back in time. I was particularly impressed by Kip Thorne's essay, in which he makes a series of predictions concerning what physicists and cosmologists will discover in the next thirty years. He explains the importance of the gravity-wave detectors that are now starting to come on line. They promise to let us read the gravitational signals of such primordal events as the collision of black holes and even the big bang itself. It is as fascinating to get to piggyback on how these great minds think as it is to read their conclusions.<br />In short, The Future of  Spacetime is a bit of a salad, but an extremely delicious and satisfying one.<br />Robert E.

He said it was the best book he'd ever seen on the politics of global climate change. After reading it, I have to agree.<br />Leggett taught oil geology at Britain's Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine before transferring his allegiance to Greenpeace, where he directed their Climate Campaign and later their Solar Initiative. In The Carbon War he provides an insider's view of the decade of battles leading up to the Kyoto treaty. Through his eyes we get to see the intense machinations of the great oil companies and their allies as they fight to block the international movement to develop a binding climate agreement. Leggett pulls no punches. He provides names, dates and details of the non-stop lobbying, shameless  \\"scientific\\" distortions, and well-financed public relations campaigns by what he and other environmentalists dubbed \\"The Carbon Club.\\" He describes in depth the behind-the-scenes collusion, pressure tactics and smears that stymied progress on the climate despite a decade of climate-related catastrophes and increasing scientific certainty about global warming and its ramifications. He also reports on the counter-punches Greenpeace and other environmental groups managed to land--for example alerting the hemorrhaging insurance industry that their catastrophic losses were not accidental and were bound to get worse unless greenhouse emissions are reduced.<br />The book ends in 2000, but all the forces Leggett reveals remain in play today. The World Summit in Johannesburg this September was torn by the same battles and struggled to reach the same kind of will-of-the-wisp agreements as Kyoto. For anyone who believes, as Leggett clearly does, that we must reduce our destabilizing assault on the atmosphere in order to maintain a stable and livable climate, this book is a must. It dives deep beneath the headlines to let you know how vital decisions concerning development, the deployment of resources, and our shared future, are actually being made. As Leggett says, \\"The race against time is on, and we should have started running by now; racing to crank up the solar revolution, racing to mobilizing the capital markets as engines for survival instead of suicide.\\"<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).ing development, the deployment of resources, and our shared future, are actually being made.

What I got was far more--an intense, well-researched, and extremely effective wake-up call concerning the distorting and often destructive effects of the American fast food industry on our domestic economy, homes, schools, farms, ranches, and workers, now rapidly being imposed on the rest of the world.<br />Eric Schlosser's review of the history of the fast food industry reminded me of the enormous changes that have occurred in America since the 1950s, many of them due to or inspired by fast food. Cities and suburbs were not always just one identical strip mall after another, children were not the targets of endless marketing campaigns, most families could get by with only one full-time worker, schools did not provide kids with junk food and subject them to advertising, and we didn't read about nationwide outbreaks of E-coli and salmonella. The effects of the fast food industry and the franchising movement it inspired are so pervasive that they are essentially invisible, especially to young people. It takes a book like Fast Food Nation to make us take a hard look at what is going on.<br />Schlosser goes far beyond what we can see with our own eyes or learn from the newspapers. He did his homework for this book, traveling the country, interviewing everyone from the leaders in the industry to the immigrant meatpackers who risk their lives and limbs for minimum wages in hellish killing and packing factories. Fully aware of the fast food industry's tendency to attack any critic with every legal tool available, including the infamous \\"veggie libel laws,\\" Schlosser documents every one of his assertions in depth; he provides 55 pages of end notes, and five fine-print pages of bibliography.<br />We all know that fast food is making us fat. What I didn't realize is the extent to which the fast food industry, with its enormous financial clout, gluttony for low-cost meat, chicken, potatoes and labor, its eagerness to suck millions from Washington and from state and local governments in the form of subsides and tax breaks, and its lobbying-protected union busting and dismantling of workers safety rules and enforcement, has affected not just our landscape and diet, but our economy and lifestyle as well. Schlosser shows how it has led to the growth of giant food processors and factory farms at the expense of independent farmers, ranchers and packers. It has led to the importation of large numbers of immigrant workers who live (and often die) to provide us with our burgers.  Millions of teenagers are lured away from school to staff fast food outlets, again at minimum wages and given minimal training. And, Schlosser shows, the fast food industry is now exporting the entire system abroad. I now understand why a tour bus driver in Scotland pointed to a McDonald's outlet and announced to us, \\"and there's the American Embassy.\\"<br />Fast food Nation is an angry, frightening and eye-opening book.

If you want to know the state of those fields today, and how they got where they are, this book is ideal. Several things set it apart from Hawking's bestseller, A Brief History of Time. In The Universe in a Nutshell, he provides more of the history of cosmological thinking, and goes on to give sparklingly clear descriptions of some more recent developments, such as branes (lower-dimensional spaces that are subsets of higher-dimensional universes) and M-theory, a meta-theory that unites supergravity and string theories.  In the current book, Hawking also makes frequent and interesting use of the anthropic principle, which limits our universe in certain ways since if it were significantly different galaxies, stars, planets, and humans could not have appeared. I was surprised and pleased to find Hawking taking time to speculate on the future of humanity given our ability to create increasingly complex organisms, and electronic systems. And, the book is full of colorful and helpful illustrations. Like A Brief History of Time, The Universe in a Nutshell is full of Hawking's witty asides. My favorite was, &quot;Newton occupied the Lucasian chair at Cambridge that I now hold, though it wasn't electrically operated at that time.&quot; I found the book to be a delightful and highly informative read.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002)	2002-11-08

The authors are prominent neuroscientists who know what they are talking about, and are able to write about it clearly and vividly. They set out to trace the findings and implications of a new science, cultural biology. The authors believe that cultural biology can \\"demystify the dynamic engagement between brain and world,\\" and provide new insights into vital questions such as \\"why we live together, love, ..., and sacrifice ourselves for others.\\"<br />Cultural biology attempts to synthesize the contributions of biology--our genes, the course of development, and our brains--with the effects of environment and culture. In the authors hands, it often succeeds in breaking out of old dichotomies such as nature vs. nurture, genetic vs. cultural determinism, humans as fundamentally social or fundamentally selfish, to provide a new, significantly more balanced understanding of how our biological raw material interacts with the world throughout our lives. The book lives up to its promise to shed new light on the rich interplay between genes and environment throughout the course of development, the limits that our biology locks us into, and the potentials it provides.<br />Although you may not agree with everything the authors say, Liars, Lovers, and Heroes will make you take a fresh look at the assumptions we all make about \\"human nature.\\" You may walk away with genuinely new insights about why we humans love, hate and nurture. The book is important, informative and a pleasure to read.<br />Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).	2002-11-05

Fred Adams, an astrophysicist at the University of Michigan bit off an awfully big chunk when he set out to write the Origins of Existence. \\"This book,\\" he writes, \\"tells the story of global cosmic ecology, from the smallest asteroids to the almost unfathomable scale of the whole universe, and even beyond. It is a history of the cosmos, from before the big bang to the formation of galaxies, stars, planets, and moons. It is the story of microscopic particles organizing themselves into ever-larger molecular structures, with ever-increasing levels of complexity, and culminating in the everyday miracle that we call life. It is a scientific glimpse of the face of creation.\\"<br />Factually, Adams succeeds remarkably well. In the book's 222 pages, he manages to pack a pretty thorough survey of current scientific thinking about the big bang, the genesis of our cosmos with its physical laws, particles, and structures, on through the formation of stars, planets, and life. He also touches on some of the multiverse theories which may help explain why our particular universe is so remarkably well-tuned to the eventual emergence of life, including beings like ourselves who are capable of noticing and wondering at that fine-tuning. And he projects the very long-term prospects of the universe as well.<br />Unfortunately, in the unfolding of all this intrinsically fascinating material, it seems to lose much of its sparkle. As I read through Adams' exposition, I came to feel that some key features were lacking--most notably mention of the people who made the discoveries or came up with the ideas he describes, and a sense of narrative, how these ideas developed over time. Scanning the book's index, I count only about 35 names (and at least half of those are actually concepts named after people, like the Hubble flow). This reflects the fact that almost all of the ideas Adams presents are described as though they popped into existence from some sort of conceptual reservoir without the intervention of human beings. And that sense of impersonal fact is matched by the near-absence of story-telling. There's very little sense of things being found out by people over time and despite difficulties. As a result, the book seems somewhat \\"flat.\\" If it were a survey course on the current state of cosmology, which it well could be, I wonder how well-attended it would be.<br />That's not to say the book is without any saving moments. Every so often Adams comes through with a great comment, for example predicting that \\". . . solar systems are crowded with astronomical petri dishes.\\" He also works hard to put the cosmos into perspective, providing a useful scale of the energy involved in different events and offering tools for comparing the very big and very small numbers that characterize the universe. He provides one of the best explanations I've read of the multiple \\"rolled up\\" dimensions that sting theory and M-theory say co-exist with the macroscopic dimension we're able to sense. And, by coming back again and again to the many levels of \\"fine tuning\\" that have allowed our universe to last as long as it has and grow structures such as galaxies, stars and planets, and, in our neck of the woods at least, complex living organisms, Adams forces the reader to question, as have many physicists, just how that might have come about.<br />So, I'd suggest reading Origins of Existence if you're interested in the concepts Adams so comprehensively presents, and if you're willing to overlook the rather impersonal way in which these fascinating ideas are handled.<br />Robert Adler<br />Author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).ntervention of human beings.

Surgical anesthesia was America's first great scientific gift to the world. Since ancient times, and throughout the history of Europe, surgery, however necessary, was an unimaginable nightmare. Even the simplest procedure understandably stirred intense dread. And almost any sugery could prove fatal because of pain and shock. Of necessity, surgeons had to work at lightning speed, amputating a limb or &quot;cutting for the stone&quot; in minutes.<br />All this changed in 1846, at Massachusetts General Hospital, when a young man named Gilbert Abbot underwent the first surgery using ether anesthesia. The surgeon was Dr. John C. Warren, whose position and reputation allowed him to take this radical step. The person administering the ether was an ambitious dentist, William Morton, one of the unlikely and ill-fated heroes of the ether story.<br />As Julie Fenster reveals the events that led to and followed from the inception of ether anesthesia, she deftly reveals the human foibles of the key participants: the high-living, risk-taking Morton, the idealistic Horace Wells, and the brilliant and arrogant Charles Jackson. Anesthesia was a great gift to mankind, but it proved the undoing of its flawed discovers.<br />It's a great story, well told and well worth reading.<br />Robert Adler<br />Author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).	2002-10-13

The subject--the peopling of the Americas--is one I am fascinated by. The author is an investigative journalist who spent years tracking down the archaeological sites, the scientists, and the artifacts that promise to reveal when, how and by whom the Americas were first populated.<br />The book has some major strengths. In its 556 pages of text it does address pretty much every aspect of the story: the Clovis First paradigm and the recent cracks in its foundation, the Beringian land bridge-Canadian ice-free corridor entry into the New World and its critics, the oldest bones and their intensely controversial cultural/geographic connections, and the intense debate, especially in the U.S., over scientific study of ancient human remains vs. reburial by interested Native American groups under the NAGPRA law.<br />It also has some glaring weaknesses. The biggest problem is the author's tendency to inject herself into the story. Not only did I learn far more about how every landscape, lab or pictograph looked to her, and even what she ate for lunch than I needed or wanted to know, but I also ran into far more of her theorizing about digs, artifacts, findings and theories than I wanted. She interviewed most of the players in this field and seems to have read most of the literature. But in selecting from this mass of material, I would have liked a lot more science and a lot less gossip. It seems to me that a good editor could have trimmed this book by 50 percent, and greatly improved it in the process.<br />One thing that emerges from the book is that the story is far from finished. Hopefully a new generation of scientists, less wedded to rigid doctrines such as &quot;Clovis First,&quot; and using newer and better analytic approaches, will shed much-needed light on this vexed subject. And hopefully someone will tell the story with the clarity and discipline it deserves.<br />Still, anyone interested in this fascinating area will get something from _Bones_, even if, like me, they find themselves thumbing impatiently through the verbiage to try to find the real &quot;bones.&quot;<br />Robert Adler<br />Author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).ething from _Bones_, even if, like me, they find themselves thumbing impatiently through the verbiage to try to find the real &quot;bones.&quot;<br />Robert Adler<BR>Author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley, 2002).	2002-10-13

He's a hard-headed, clear-thinking, practical-minded oil geologist with a long career in the oil industry. So when he announces that world oil production is going to peak within a very few years (2004-1008) and then start an inevitable decline, you sit up and listen.<br /><br />Deffeyes bases his prediction on an improved version of the work of the legendary M. King Hubbert, another Shell geologist, who predicted in 1956 that United States oil production would peak and start to decline in the early 1970s. Although Hubbert was decried as a doomsayer, he proved to be exactly right. Of course, that's one of the reasons that the U.S. is so dependent on foreign oil, which in turn is one of the reasons that we are so deeply entangled in the morass of the Middle East.<br /><br />Deffeyes details his sobering prediction clearly, cleanly and convincingly. Along the way he rewards the reader with a wry insider's guide to the history of oil, oil geology and the oil industry. He doesn't waste a word. I can't remember when I learned more per page than I did reading _Hubbert's Peak_.<br /><br />If Deffeyes is right, the implications are enormous. Anyone who wants to know what's really going to happen in the engine room of our economy should read this book.<br /><br />Robert E.

Not so with Gould's \\"penultimate reflections in Natural History,\\" published in 2000, just two years before his death. I found them entrancing (despite Gould's trademark parenthetical comments).<br />Two factors make Gould's essays stand out from most science writing--the depth of his ideas and his unmatched ability to peel back layers of approximate understanding and convenient storytelling to get to what actually happened. Whether he's detailing the founding moments of palentology and geology or excavating Alfred Russel Wallace's forays into predicting the future, you know that you're going to get the real story, impeccably told, straight from the primary sources. As a science writer, I'm awed as much by Gould's impeccable scholarship as by the quality and originality of his thinking. Gould is absolutely clear-eyed about the progress of science. The tales he tells reflect it as a richly human enterprise, groping its way forward despite misconceptions, hoaxes, and the personal quirks of its protagonists.<br />This book is not a light or easy read, but it is a richly rewarding one.<br />Robert E.

In the course of his life and career he experienced and wrote about most of the great movements and changes of his times. Typically, he perceived patterns long before others, inevitably with a truly unique understanding, and wrote about them beautifully.<br />In The Sleepwalkers, Koestler traced what he thought to be the mainstream of the development of science through exquisitely researched and written biographies of some of science's leading figures. There's no part of the book that isn't well worth reading, but I think that his treatments of Copernicus and Kepler are hair-raisingly insightful.<br />Readers can confidently expect to put down The Sleepwalkers with increased knowledge and new insights about the history of science and the stellar figures Koestler describes. Still, don't expect a quick read. Koestler thinks and writes in depth, and takes the time to guide readers where he wants to take them.<br />Robert Adler<br />Science Writer<br />Author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (John Wiley & Sons, 2002, ISBN 0471401749).	2002-10-04
