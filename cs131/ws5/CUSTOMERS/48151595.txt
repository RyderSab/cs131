When Captain William Kidd was hanged at Execution Dock in London on May 23rd, 1701, his body was suspended in a cage (gibbeting) as a warning to those tempted by the ways of piracy. Such was his legend as a pirate, that there is a pub called the Captain Kidd in the same locale to this day. <br /> <br />Yet the legend never really covered the fine detail of Kidd's life and career, and we must be grateful to Richard Zacks for this exceptional piece of research. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have done such a bang up job of describing the content, I will just add that this is a superb companion volume to David Cordingly's equally excellent Under The Black Flag. Both men have delved very deeply to create their magnificent contributions to the history of piracy. <br /> <br />It certainly does seem that the Scottish-born Kidd had been betrayed one way or another, and that he had in fact been more of a troubled privateer than a true pirate. Perhaps his biggest mistake was in trusting the officials who employed him. <br /> <br />As Bob Dylan once wrote, some men rob you with a gun, others rob you with a pen.	2005-09-26

Yes, I'm a Believer friends, and I have hairs on my palms to prove it.    This is the book that those gutless, cyborg-like imbeciles Strunk and White would have written if they had possessed one iota of talent. In another life, boys. And your mother, too.

Later, when I read the book, I marvelled at how Laurie's asymmetrical imagery paralleled the bewitching asymmetry of Dick's memoir - as brilliantly captured by Allison. <br /> <br />Dick was a fine human being, flaws and all, and a man who was not afraid to take a long, hard look at himself and his life, good and bad. Through it all, his sense of how lucky he was to have spent his life with the enchanting Seesaw Girl is both touching and refreshing.  <br /> <br />As for it being too challenging a read, I grew up on William Burroughs, so this is a walk in the park. <br /> <br />I hope the resurgence of interest in Things Bewitched due to the excellent Nicole Kidman/Will Ferrell movie, will boost the sales of this wonderful book and this unique insight into the man who immortalized Sam's mortal husband. We miss them both.	2005-07-31

Whatever criticisms can be levelled against this book, I believe it to be Bill's honest attempt to reveal the Truth as he knew it, at that time. <br /> <br />For those who are new to Conspiracy Theory, this is a mine of information, and for those who are more knowledgable, it still stands as a classic of the genre, and a very courageous book. <br /> <br />Bill's 'convenient' death in a questionable shootout came as no surprise to most Conspiracy buffs, as the guy threw down the gauntlet in a big way. He was fearless. <br /> <br />One fascinating addition to his Kennedy assassination info came in his video, Kennedy: The Sacrificed King, in which he examines the Zapruder film of Kennedy being hit, and by virtual frame advancing, the clip appears to show JFK's driver, William Greer, shooting JFK over his shoulder, delivering the second and probably ultimately fatal shot. <br /> <br />As for some of his Alien info, I know military intelligence hierarchies, and Bill was only operating at a relatively low level in his Naval Intel role (whatever his supposed Clearance), so he never had access to the big picture, and he himself was vulnerable to Disinformation, as he suspected himself. What he conveys is a mixture of Truth and DI. <br /> <br />On a technical note, the book is not a polished,  edited finished product, and many of his strategies such as continuous capitalization for emphasis make it hard to read at times, but the content itself makes it well worth the effort to press on. <br /> <br />Like so many of his brothers and sisters, the guy served his Country with honor in Vietnam. There is much to respect about the man. <br /> <br />	2005-07-08

I read the lesser, although well-intentioned book by Stanley Weintraub, but this is clearly the best book on the subject of the tragically short Christmas Truce, 1914. <br /> <br />The very fact that the truce even arose, suggests the idea that even World War One was a war orchestrated by the World Banking System. There was no logical reason for the Brits and the Germans, who had fought together (as the Prussians) to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo, to go to war with each other. <br /> <br />The more you read about how much the troops had in common, and how much they resisted resuming combat, the more angry you become at the sheer fraud underlying modern conflict. I seriously question whether there are any 'honest wars', and I am no pacifist. I just hate to think of people's sons and daughters dying so that rich people get get even richer. <br /> <br />	2005-07-04

Having now obtained the full, combined version of RE (previously I had only read Volume 1), I must revisit this review. Volume 2, which is now the second part of the combined volume, is a fascinating record of Helen's regression sessions, conducted by the excellent Dr. June Steiner. The full book, at almost 400 pages, is a very powerful addition to the ever-increasing volume of credible Alien Abduction/Hybridization data.    I have had the pleasure of communicating with the superb Dave Jacobs (The Threat) and as a result of his and the late John Mack's work on the Alien Abduction phenomenon, I feel there is enough data out there to refute the standard skeptic's notion that the entire subject is fanciful.    As Fox Mulder once said on the X-Files (and I'm paraphrasing), if you say you've seen a UFO or been Abducted by Aliens, people are ready to commit you. If you say you've seen the Virgin Mary, they'll build a shrine outside your house.    Top 20 Reviewer Dennis Littrell's idea that people can sometimes fall into these belief systems as an escape mechanism is very sound, but I feel that the desire to be 'more than human' is also a harmonic of the innate knowledge that we actually are more than human. As many New Age psychologists and philosophers have said, we are spiritual beings having a human experience.    My own past life regression (go on, get the net) included a chain of linked death-in-combat recalls, the earliest of which was 10 million years ago in another galaxy. So to me, there is nothing remotely fanciful or inconceivable about this rather interesting story. Like Dennis, I also love the spelling of Raechel, which coupled with the spooky cover (by Noah J. Crissey), adds to the mystique.    Having had many regression sessions, much of which was past life regression, I feel Helen's sessions are the icing on the cake, in the wake of Part I of the book. They seem 100% legit, and Dr. Steiner obviously knows her stuff. The session data should leave the readerin no doubt about the validity of Helen's experiences and the accuracy and truth of the story of Marisa and Raechel.     I cannot think of another book that openly approaches the idea of direct and extended close contact with an Alien-Human hybrid, even though we have known of the existence of the program - via impeccable sources such as Dr. David Jacobs and John Mack etc. for years. This is a classic work on that basis alone.    Helen's book is a very worthwhile addition to the ever-increasing volume of what my psychologist friend Jerry describes as 'disturbing evidence of something that the blinkered skeptics will one day have to confront directly'.    Bring it on.	2005-07-03

I haven't read the book in years, but I have just ordered it from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Gabriel Bernstein has got it. It is perfect. Ray Bradbury is a beautiful writer, whose very reverence for LIFE itself is a joy to behold.<br /><br />The sheer quality of the reviews for this masterpiece tells you something about the kind of reaction that the average reader has had. It touched them. It reached them, in a way that few things ever do. Transcendent is certainly the word to describe the experience I had with this and other Bradbury books - the breathtakingly original The Halloween Tree being another must-have.<br /><br />In the section I referred to in the title of this review, a young man meets an elderly lady in an ice cream parlor/store and they are both triggered by the phrase \\"a dish of lime vanilla ice\\". The inference is that they are a pair of star-crossed lovers, who either have been a couple in the past (in another life) or will be in the future, in a time when a young boy meets a young girl in a similar setting, and they re-experience this magical, soul-triggering phrase...<br /><br />As a writer myself, I can appreciate the sheer magic that Bradbury shoe-horns into every paragraph. The warmth, the humanity, the feeling of just being glad to be alive in order to savor every sunrise, every cold winter's morn, the sound of the crickets, the smell of the apple blossom, the rumble of an old Ford, the impossible sweetness of that heart-stopping first kiss...<br /><br />I live in a small town myself, and ordering books and CDs is a frustrating task. I cannot thank Amazon enough for being my lifeline to so many modern works of genius, such as this and indeed any other book my this true Modern Master.<br /><br />By the way, Doug Spaulding is a combination of Bradbury's middle name Douglas and his father's surname, Spaulding (his mother was  Bradbury).<br /><br />I simply cannot recommend this highly enough.	2005-06-16

As a feminist writer put it, it would have been like chewing gum while eating caviar, and the myth was almost a diminishent of Marianne's femininity. <br /> <br />A powerful book by a courageous and multi-talented woman who has too often been dismissed as a Stones hanger-on. Check out her new album Before The Poison, and you'll see that she is still very much an artist in her own right.	2005-06-12
US	48151595	RO2MW9G0PNQ85	0306810115	304555551	Heisenberg's War: The Secret History Of The German Bomb	Books	5	10	11	N	N	The relative nature of history	This is a solid, well-researched book that presents Heisenberg in  a fair light, for once. <br /> <br />One of the problems with reader/reviewer bias is that many people are pre-disposed to finding fault with any suggestions that conflict with what they want to hear or believe. Regarding the Farm Hall recordings, some people have latched onto the idea that Heisenberg and others knew of the build up of the Holocaust, but continued to work for the Bomb project. <br /> <br />What they are usually referring to is a section in which Heisenberg talked about five Jewish scientists, whom he obviously cared about, who had been arrested and later killed; and even though Heisenberg was talking openly about putting out feelers to see if they could be helped or saved (which alone could have put him at great risk), this somehow translates into guilt in some people's eyes.  <br /> <br />As for him 'not co-operating with Hitler'... nobody in their right mind could possibly think that was an option. As I believe the book shows, Heisenberg did the next best thing, which was to work half-heartedly on the German Bomb. He basically killed it in 1942. <br /> <br />The fact that Heisenberg could come up with the correct basic bomb structure - path and critical mass analysis, in very short order almost certainly means that he could have brainstormed the right methodology years earlier if the German scientists had been 100% committed to producing a bomb for Hitler. If they had been Nazis. <br /> <br />To me, this fine book is one more step in the right direction, in underscoring the very fact that not all Germans were Nazis. <br /> <br />Hitler may have been a charismatic leader, but he made so many catastrophic errors, such as the insane decision to declare war on the USA in the hope that the Japanese would help him against the Russians - they never lifted a finger - that it is as true to say that Hitler lost the War as to say that the Allies won it. <br /> <br />A fair and highly recommended book.	2005-06-02

While many anti-Nazi reviewers constantly try to play down the true level of the genius that lay within the ill-conceived Third Reich, there is no denying its reality - as this book and others prove. <br /> <br />Comedian Bob Hope once invoked the wrath of the Russian Govt in the wake of the Sputnik success in the late fifties, when he said \\"I'd like to thank the 'Russian' scientists, but I don't speak German...\\" Germany was so far ahead of the Allies in everything from rocketry to sub-orbital aircraft technology, that you wonder how they could have lost the War. <br /> <br />The Amerika Bomber concept alone that Griehl explores is one more example of how Hitler failed to appreciate what was being offered to him. There were at least 4 different bombers capable of hitting the Eastern USA, perhaps the best of which being the ME 264. Yet Hitler did not seem to understand the enormous propaganda and morale impact that regular German bombing raids against the US would have had. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most stunning German design and overall concept was Sanger's 'Silverbird' sub-orbital bomber, that was to be launched on a rocket sled and propelled to the edge of space by a lengthy rocket burn, after which it would use a 'skipping' technique whereby the plane, in virtual glide mode, would keep bouncing off the atmosphere to the extent that it could literally fly around the world at high speed, bombing any target in the US on the way. The 8,000 lb bomb that it carried, dropped from the edge of space, would have had an enormously enhanced blast radius, giving it at least a battlefield nuclear weapon level of destructive capability. <br /> <br />Sanger offered this project in 1935. It could have been operational by the early 1940's. <br /> <br />The later US Dynasoar and Hypersoar projects were directly based on this German technology. <br /> <br />A must read.	2005-06-01

I confess I was drawn to this book by the title alone, and the very concept of the Mermaid Chair and its associated mythology was a tremendously powerful story element. <br /> <br />Alas, the novel never really seems to capitalize on the enormous potential of the transformational metaphors that one associates with mermaids/sirens and the function of the chair/throne in its own right.  <br /> <br />It is almost as though Sue came up with a truly inspired basic story engine and then bolted on a slightly above average romance story that isn't particularly riveting or heavy on the tension/challenge etc.  <br /> <br />There is a lot of symbolism throughout the novel, including the use of islands to suggest alienation; the sea as a metaphor for Consciousness; the contrasting Dionysian versus Apollonian energies of the two main men in her life; and in the mythological parallels between her mother chopping off her finger and the ancient mermaid's severed fingers forming the first sea creatures, but even though the magical undercurrents are there, I didn't feel that the novel's potential had been anything like fully tapped.  <br /> <br />I definitely think it's 'worth a read', but I'd wait for the paperback, too.	2005-05-27

Well that's how the die-hard, cyborg-like Sea Org people tend to come across, in my experience. <br /> <br />If I had thought this book was nothing more than an ill-informed cheap shot at Hubbard, I would not have read it, but it is not. My greatest problems with Scientology were never about the Technology, but with the over-zealousness (to put it very politely) of the Sea Org staff above all, and the absolutely unforgivable price of Services. <br /> <br />If you ever complained about the totally unrealistic cost of Services - relative to average earnings, for example, you were met with facile, brainwashed responses about 'what is Freedom worth?' and 'No Clear thinks it's expensive...' all of which totally ignore the fact that the organization is 99% money driven, whether it started that way or not; and that most of The Bridge (the structured path to spiritual freedom) is way beyond the price range of the average individual - unless they become Staff members, of course... <br /> <br />While Hubbard is seen to be a questionable character in terms of false claims about a number of issues, including aspects of his military service, as Miller reveals, he may well have developed some important technology at the heart of the Beast that Scientology eventually became. <br /> <br />It does not have some of the more immediately threatening aspects of a Cult that many true Cults possess, but it is hard to see it as anything else when you add up the lists of experiences that Miller and others have recorded and analyzed. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by reviewers who hide behind 'attacks on their religion'. If Scientology operated more like a real religion (which it could do), it would not charge so much for its Services. It's pricing structure is simply a control weapon and nothing more. <br /> <br />Read the book and make up your own mind.	2005-05-23

Seely's recognition of the Zen-like Beyond BushSpeak non-logic of Rumy (not to be confused with the actual poet Rumi!) is masterfully explored in this stunning volume. <br /> <br />Any American politician who states openly on TV that it didn't really matter if the UK did not come on board for the invasion of Iraq - as the Brits were preparing to commit their land, sea and air forces to a joint invasion force - has to be examined closely - for any neural activity, for example. <br /> <br />Hate him or hate him, Rumy has his Own Way of confusing the unwitting with his non-linear Joycean paradigms. Bush Snr. set the standard with his neologism-ridden BushSpeak, but clearly Rumy has turned out to be the Master of the Absurd. <br /> <br />The scary part about this 'existential poetry' is that much of it was lifted as is, and there are many literal quotes, however mind-tricking the meandering, Lewis Carroll on downers logic appears to become.  <br /> <br />C.

I will never forget the Vet buzz over Doc Pardue's haunting poem, 'Welcome Home My Sisters', written to honor the 10th Anniversary of the Vietnam Women's Memorial. Four female Vet friends emailed me independently and said, \\"Steve, you HAVE to read this...\\" Just a few lines in, and I could see why. <br /> <br />Kerry Pardue was a field combat medic during the Vietnam War; a war in which US troops sustained as many as 300,000 wounded, many from booby traps. The platoon medics, who went out with every combat patrol, every Search and Destroy, every assault mission, had to be both Medic and combat soldier. The fact that they were respectfully referred to as 'Doc' by their comrades, speaks volumes about their value on the battlefield. <br /> <br />Like his Marine Corpsman comrades, Doc Pardue had to make life-and-death decisions in the field, under fire, as the very first cog in the combat medical care machinery. The Docs weren't trained to stem bleeding with one hand while firing an M-16 with the other, they had to figure that out for themselves. And they did. <br /> <br />I have had the great honor of knowing Kerry for some time and he and his unforgettable poetry were a constant source of inspiration while I was writing my Nam Vet tribute eBook \\"How To Appreciate A Vietnam Vet: Dealing With The Myth Of The Unwinnable War\\" (now on Amazon.com). Doc Pardue graciously permitted me to include some of his stunning war poetry as part of my tribute to the fine men and women who served their Country with honor in Vietnam. <br /> <br />The haunting and unique cover art was created by Kerry's combat medic friend, artist Bernie Duff, and it is a perfect choice for this book cover. Doc Pardue is one of the most prolific and influential Vietnam War poets out there, and I simply cannot recommend this collection of poems highly enough. <br /> <br />Welcome home, Doc.	2005-04-28

Having read a lot of hostile reactions to this book, both in the Press and all over the Net, it seems the main knee jerk reaction has been to trash anything that may paint the Nazis in any kind of 'good light'. While I can understand that, I feel it gets in the way of a 'normal' reaction to the contents of the book. I shall hereafter refer to German rather than Nazi entities for that reason. <br /> <br />Basically, to infer that all Germans are/were Nazis is as distasteful and unreasonable as describing all Israelis as Zionists. Some are, most are not. The Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin was a hardcore terrorist who even murdered British troops during WW II, while seeking an arms deal with Mussolini, so let's not get too high and mighty here. <br /> <br />No, there is no conclusive proof about the existence of a secret German UFO or anti-gravity research progam. That does not mean that it therefore did not exist, merely that anybody suggesting that it did, is on thin ice. The closest thing to a German UFO that we have actual evidence of was the Horten disc-shaped glider and later powered glider, and various related projects. <br /> <br />Even the UFO community are deeply divided about the German UFO concept as some feel that it suggests that all UFO activity derives from German UFO technology, which is simply ridiculous. Far too many of the confirmed UFO sightings involve characteristics that make a terrestrial explanation ludicrous. <br /> <br />Nick Cook has written a brave book, and in his overall belief that the US has been intensively and secretly researching anti-grav technology, he joins other very credible researchers including former NASA consultant Richard Hoagland, who have offered examples of suppressed experimental results. <br /> <br />As for suppression... When two scientists claimed to have produced cold fusion in the lab, the Government's vested interest groups basically lined up a large body of detractors to 'prove' that they were wrong.

They called in forensic experts from a number of countries, including neutral Switzerland, claiming quite rightly, that the Russians had massacred Polish officers and civilians (in May, 1940) - more than 20,000 of them, as it turned out later - yet the US and UK chose to believe Stalin's lies when he blamed the Germans. <br /> <br />David Irving's underlying point, that you're only a war criminal if you lose, is well made, over and over again throughout this substantial book. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, some of the judgements were entirely appropriate, and I'm not a Holocaust denier. Zyklon B WAS the most efficient way to kill large numbers of humans, as it was readily available, easy to transport, and you need infinitely less concentrations to kill people than to kill insects; and it was clearly not merely used for de-lousing. Equally, I totally accept Israel's right to exist, alongside the Palestinians, but I also recognize that there are times when people are blinded by their own self-righteousness. <br /> <br />How some of these charges were ever brought is highly questionable, and how Hess, who spent the War under guard in the UK ever ended up as a show prisoner in Spandau, to appease that filthy butcher Stalin (I have Polish friends, so I will not apologize for the strong language), is just one of many mysteries. <br /> <br />A Polish friend told me a joke that runs... A Polish soldier has a German coming at him from the left and a Russian from the right. Who does he shoot first? Why, the German, of course. Business before pleasure. <br /> <br />To the victor the spoils? To the victor the rules. <br /> <br />A very sobering and detailed book. I think David Irving did a fine job.

While I don't accept that the war was literally unwinnable, I totally agree that the way it was being fought, with no sense of a Win Scenario at any time, resulted in a mindless and sickening waste of human life - on both sides. <br /> <br />President Johnson, the simpleton who put more than 500,000 US troops in harm's way, yet never defined a Win Scenario or Exit Strategy, once boasted that the Air Force \\"couldn't even bomb an outhouse\\" without his approval. Similarly, the target selection for the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign in which the US lost 922 aircraft, was carried out at cozy White House lunches, without a single Air Force commander being present. <br /> <br />Sue's anger at a mind-numbingly incompetent Government, who denied Ho Chi Minh a fair crack at democratic elections (which he may well have won) by installing the hateful and corrupt Diem in the South, is well stated. <br /> <br />These stories take you under the hood, behind the propaganda and the lies and put you right there in the middle of a war that either should never have happened or which should have been fought very differently at the very least. <br /> <br />A great writer.

Possibly. I don't know any such people myself, but I do know a lot of very dynamic achievers who regularly smoke marijuana. Yet alcohol which is fully and widely acknowleged to have ruined the lives of millions of people, as has gambling, is totally legal and freely available. <br /> <br />Do you know anybody who experiences increased aggression while on marijuana? Decreased, yes. That's why a number of police officers have stated that they would rather go into a room full of stoners than a room full of drunks. <br /> <br />There are many things in this world that do create social problems, especially those involving extreme violence. Compared to ultra-violent TV and movie shows, first person shooter computer games and hard liquor, where is marijuana on the scale of things? Nowhere. It is not a factor in increasing violent tendencies, quite the reverse. <br /> <br />If the boys who carried out the Columbine massacre had been found to have traces of marijiana in their systems, we would never have heard the end of it. Yet how much has been made of the presence of traditional pharmaceuticals in the system of either shooter? <br /> <br />In 14 years, we will see the FIRST centennial of woman suffrage. Prior to 1918, it was ILLEGAL for a woman, even a white, university educated woman, to vote in an election, own property or inherit property from her father. <br /> <br />Did that make sense? Was it fair? Was it sane? <br /> <br />No, but it was the Law. Just as it was illegal to be a homosexual, to practice witchcraft, or to commit suicide until well into the latter half of the 20th century. <br /> <br />The Law.

As Dennis Littrell suggested, Jenkins realizes that the 'trap the end user' approach will never even slow down the growth of this disturbing industry, and some of the more Draconian measures being suggested in some circles would only damage the freedom to surf of normal everyday users. <br /> <br />One point that many people might be unaware of is the fact that child pornography often involves children under five, as Jenkins suggests. Clearly this flies in the face of 'normal' sexual and reproductive urges, whereby males are only supposed to respond to females who are in the throes of puberty and beyond.  <br /> <br />While it is certainly true to say that mere child nudity does not equate to child pornography, a common tactic of borderline sites is to place 'trigger' pictures in with legitimate 'lolita-esque' nude photos, which then lead to screens or sites that appear to offer a portal to an actual child pornography site, rather than plunging people straight into one. <br /> <br />The problem with writing books of this nature is that the Law is often in a state of flux. One of biggest 'gray' areas in terms of legality is the use of artificially generated/cgi child pornography. The 'pro' arguments suggest that as no children are being harmed or exploited, it doesn't qualify as child pornography. The 'contra' arguments suggest that it still involves images of adults having sex with children. At the time of writing this review, I believe it is still techincally legal. <br /> <br />Some years ago, a man was arrested for some sketches he made of naked adults and children embracing, without any specific suggestion of sexual contact. The counter argument to the prosecution stance made the point that drawing a sexual fantasy (or now, creating it with a computer graphics package) rather than merely thinking the same thoughts, should not be illegal, unless any attempt was being made to circulate it/them. The point being that this transition from a thought image to a cgi image, borders on the question of the Thought Crime of George Orwell's 1984, and the Inquisition logic of 'If she floats she's a witch and if she drowns, she's innocent'. <br /> <br />Jenkins has some solid ideas, such as monitoring message boards and the infrastructure by which the sub-net is able to operate, rather than setting up fake sites to lure in Joe Idiot who's just had a few beers, and thinking that such actions will ever impact the industry. <br /> <br />One of the biggest factors in the quantum growth of the 'CP' industry is the availability of white, Eastern European child victims. Previously, white children were never available in such numbers, which seems to have been a natural limiter on certain areas of this darkest of growth industries. <br /> <br />Sadly, where ever there is poverty, there will always be exploitation, and the online CP industry is just one part of a bigger picture - of a World and a people gone wrong, and the failure of the human race to love each other in the face of all our differences. <br /> <br />Yes, read this and be concerned about the sexual exploitation of children, but never forget that the greater obscenity is that 34,000 children DIE every day throughout the same world in which some rich people have gold-plated bath taps. <br />	2004-11-23

Ee done a fine job on this ere book, Mr. Cordingly. <br /> <br />Okay, I won't do the entire review in costume, but having just watched the incomparable Johnny Depp in Pirates Of The Caribbean, I'm definitely in a piratical frame of mind. Arrrrrr. <br /> <br />This is a superb piece of research, and while it can be a little dry and academic in places, for those of us who have a pirate thing going on, David has done us proud with this powerhouse of information. <br /> <br />As other shipmates have mentioned, he also includes Mary Read and Ann(e) Bonny, who were part of Calico Jack Rackham's crew - with Bonny being his common law wife. <br /> <br />Any of you who have seen the Depp classic, will remember that when you see the Black Pearl's Jolly Roger flag unfurled, it is the unmistakable skull and crossed swords of Calico Jack. When I put my company Five Ships Ltd together ([...]) some years ago, we adopted Rackham's flag as our company logo. Arrrrrrrr.... Rex Quondam Rexque Futurus - King That Was, King That Will Be. <br /> <br />One of the few omissions from David's book is the fact that the pirate skull and crossed bones/swords is actually the Ancient Egyptian sign of Osiris Risen, with all of its rebirth/resurrection imagery. For the very same reasons, it was the battle flag of the Knights Templar, and when the Templar fleet escaped from La Rochelle as the Pope and the French King moved against the Templars in 1307, they flew the skull and bones as an act of defiance. <br /> <br />Still, this is a superb book, if a trifle conventional, and an absolutely essential purchase for those of us who love the smell of burning merchantmen in the morning...

Let us not forget also, that it was Polish troops who finally stormed Monte Cassino in the Italian campaign, and took the German surrender. <br /> <br />Sadly, the book also details how the unforgivable betrayal of Poland and its wonderful, courageous people, was arranged by the western allies, who agreed to the demands of that filthy butcher Stalin. <br /> <br />Hard to believe that the British, who actually went to war over the Nazi invasion of Poland, would give her up to a moron and a tyrant who was provably even worse than Hitler. <br /> <br />Sorry for the strong words, but they are appropriate in this case. Ask any Pole with a sense of history. <br /> <br />I was curious to read that in a poll at the end of the War, a majority of Brits thought the Poles should return 'home'. Not that their home existed anymore. <br /> <br />I had about five Polish-English kids in my class as I was growing up in England, and my sense was that their families were very respected, not only because their dads had served with honor in the RAF or the Polish regiments of the British Army, but also because they hated the Russians even more than we did (this was Cold War England), so they could do no wrong in a climate of Commie hating. <br /> <br />Poland is now a NATO country, resting under the Alliance nuclear umbrella. It is no longer possible to invade Poland without risking annihilation. <br /> <br />It's about time. <br />	2004-09-02

Honorable was a word used by another reviewer and that sums The Ron up. <br /> <br />He didn't set out to win elections by dredging up dubious dirt on his opponent, he set out to win simply by being BETTER than his opponent. And he was. <br /> <br />Like Winston Churchill, whose mother was American, Ron loved his country very deeply and fought to defend it and everything it stood for with a clarity and a strength and a passion that we simply have not seen since. <br /> <br />George Bush Jr. scraped through in the last election, and if he wins this one, it will have been because his PR crew relied on pitting Vietnam Vet against Vietnam Vet while his unworthy running mate is once again a five-time draft dodger. <br /> <br />Ron wasn't even a combat veteran, nor was Margaret Thatcher, but they had a strength of vision and an integrity and a love of democracy that inspired those who were. <br /> <br />When Baroness Thatcher curtsied at Ron's funeral, it was the ultimate compliment to a great man, and a great American, the likes of whom we may never see again. <br /> <br />I hope I'm wrong. <br />	2004-08-29

I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />Even among my Vietnam Vet friends, who range from Marines and combat medics to Army Nurses and Red Cross Donut Dollies, there is a great deal of variation in how they experience PTSD. <br /> <br />As many of the non-Vet readers will know, trauma is trauma, whether it is combat-related or not, and this book approaches it in that way. <br /> <br />One Vietnam Vet friend who worked on the IWCS system in Thailand (troposcatter long haul communications) suffers from PTSD, even though his support role to the Vietnam-based forces technically kept him out of harm's way. <br /> <br />Whether you are interested in self-healing or in understanding the pain of others close to you, this book is a wonderful place to start.	2004-08-22

To that extent, I felt that the sexual content tended to fall between two stools, in that it didn't quite develop in a fully satisfying way.<br /><br />There were elements of the story, especially the times when the adult Henry interacts with the young Clare (she is 6 and he is 40-ish when they first meet in The Meadow) that reminded me of the relationship between Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell. This, especially after reading Katie Roiphe's stunning novel Still She Haunts Me - available through Amazon.com.<br /><br />I take my hat off to Audrey for creating a very compelling first novel, which I am delighted to say has been a best seller. Certainly a breath of fresh air compared to most writers' offerings.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-08-08

Dusty, aka Dana Shuster, Diana Dwan Poole, and Captain Mary 'Chris' Banigan, who sadly passed away earlier this year. Ask any Nam Nurse who served even one Tour what it must have taken to go back a second time and they will shake their heads. Yet Dana Shuster did go back.<br />Dana takes you behind the ranks of bungling self-serving politicians, the failed or absent strategies, to show you the human cost of a war that made no sense to the people fighting it, even as it was happening. <br />As Country Joe rightly said, Hello David is a classic by anybody's standards, and remains one of the most stark, chilling snapshots of the daily quota of heartbreak that the Nam Nurses had to endure every 72-hour working week. As Dana asks, who will give her something for her pain?<br />Yet Dusty also captures what was perhaps the most unforgivable aspect of the Vietnam War - the blaming of the troops, (who were routinely called 'baby killers' on their return to the US) and the Nurses, Red Cross workers and WACs who risked their own lives to support them.<br />Yet even when she writes about being pelted with beer cans, her transcendent sense of humor brings her to reflect on the philosophical question of whether the beer cans were half-empty or half-full.<br />I was lucky enough to obtain a signed copy of Battle Dressing, which Dusty signed 'Blessings and peace'.

As if there was some other kind.<br />As with Byron 'Doc' Holley's &quot;Vietnam 1968-69: A Battalion Surgeon's Journal&quot; (available through Amazon.com) - David Hackworth's Doc, Sharon G W has written her haunting record in the form of a journal. Her day by day account of a Nam Nurse's life, of long hours, and ever-present but unknown risks, is compelling reading.<br />The striking title comes from SGW's poem about dealing with the Vietnam Experience. Something which a huge number of Vets are still dealing with every day. Like her courageous sisters before her, Frances Slanger (KIA 1944) and Sharon Ann Lane (KIA Vietnam, 1969), Sharon Grant Wildwind risked her own young life to help save thousands of young soldiers in the face of extreme danger and harsh conditions.<br />The daily Nam life is broken up periodically by reflections marked &quot;Calgary, Alberta&quot;, where Sharon was living while she put the book together. They give you additonal insights and a level of perspective that creates an almost transcendent feel to the overall book. Towards the end, there is even a copy of SGW's Bronze Star citation, as well as a wonderful picture of her receiving it.<br />While she expresses some skepticism about the value of the medal, she knows that her time in Vietnam is something to be proud of. No argument here.<br />If you can read this graphic record of the triumph of the human spirit with dry eyes, you've got a problem.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-10

Previously, details about Frances Slanger had been slightly scant and it had been reported that she had been killed by an Enemy sniper. Welch gets it right in indicating that she had actually been killed during an artillery barrage.<br />Even by Day 3, the slowly expanding Normandy beach heads were a dangerous place to be. Despite overwhelming Allied airpower, involving thousands of combat sorties per day, the Germans were still putting up determined resistance on the ground.<br />Even the act of wading ashore was not without its dangers, especially given that Frances Slanger was barely five feet tall. She was one of only four nurses to land at Normandy while it was still an intensely active combat zone. Yet in spite of the mines, the snipers, the artillery exchanges and the odd air attack, Slanger and her courageous sisters pitched in immediately to help care for the endless influx of wounded. <br />A few months later, she became the first Army Nurse KIA of the post-Overlord campaign.<br />While ever America can still produce women like Frances Slanger and Sharon Ann Lane, and men like the brave young warriors that they gave their own young lives to support, the enemies of Freedom will never win.<br />Never.<br />An outstanding book.	2004-06-05

While A Walk On The Beach represents the final part of a divine trinity of books, the internal divine trinity is the coming together of the two Joans in the presence of the Sea - which has always been a metaphor for Consciousness, the Womb of the Great Mother.<br />Joan Anderson is a great observer of Life and the human experience, and her ablity to articulate the way people think and feel, especially in the context of relationships, of all kinds, is unsurpassed.<br />That she should meet Erikson's wife in a beach/seashore setting, especially in Cape Cod, Mass, in magical New England, the virtual birthplace of what is now the United States, is most interesting - the seashore also being a symbolic point of transition for a mermaid/siren figure seeking transformation into mortal womanhood, as in The Girl In A Swing, by Richard Adams (also an excellent movie).<br />With the two Joans, the transformation is mutual, as these wisewomen unfold their lives in quite different marital circumstances.<br />For the record, Erikson the psychologist extended Freudian theory by factoring in the effects of culture and environment to the stages of human development rather than merely biological influences. To Erikson, development was a lifelong process. The main criticisms of this work focused on his gender and ethnocentric bias. The later, Third Wave psychology of Maslow and after, addressed the individual's relationship to the Universe itself, rather than the experiential layer generated by society.<br />Joan Erikson herself continued to expand on the work she had done with her husband with her own hands-on experience of old age (she was 90 when the Joans met), and Joan A was able to benefit from this wisdom first hand. Similarly, she was able to help Joan Erikson with her own major life adjustments, including the impending death of a Life partner, by sharing her own growth lessons as she re-structured her thinking as she moved into the second stage of her life.<br />I can see whysome people regard this as 'a woman's book', (I disagree, it's a thinking PERSON'S book) but as a man with four daughters who has published a book about the suppression of the Feminine, I found it intriguing. The beautiful interactions between these two remarkable unfinished women reminds you that menopause and after is supposed to be a sacred transition, not a form of mental illness, as we have been programmed to believe.<br />Invaluable.	2004-05-29

An excellent collection of the vast majority of his published works.<br />While Eliot lived into the sixties, there is an inevitable temptation to concentrate on his earlier classic works such as The Love Song Of J Alfred Prufrock, which yielded the above line, The Waste Land and The Hollow Men above all.<br />A lot of Eliot's perspectives involve psychological impotence, and a majestic failure to act, and be a part of events, of the World, the Life, if you like; such as in the lines \\"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. I do not think that they will sing for me.\\" <br />Here, he writes about isolation and alienation, with accompanying non-participation. The impotent voyeur, as in Joyce's Ulysses, based on the classical myth. Joyce's Sirens are Lydia and Mina, the 'sexy barmaids' at the Ormond Hotel. Bloom can hear their siren song from the next bar, as they lure the male clientele to part with their cash, but he is separate from events; reflecting cyborg-like on their music which he terms 'musemathematics'.<br />While The Waste Land and The Hollow Men in particular were clearly written during a time of deep spiritual crisis, Eliot did transcend this period and they are not really representative of his later life philosophy.<br />One stanza from T S Eliot's The Hollow Men, became the source of Nevil Shute's book title On The Beach - this being his 1957 post-apocalyptic novel which later appeared as the 1963 Gregory Peck movie of the same name, about the last doomed survivors of a nuclear holocaust.<br />In this last of meeting places<BR>We grope together<BR>And avoid speech<BR>Gathered on this beach of the tumid river<br />The J G Ballardesque inner landscape that Eliot creates, of decaying cities and civilizations and the encroaching spiritual desert, `sunlight on a broken column', the final phase of extreme Entropy, the suppression of the Eternal Feminine, is just all part of the ultimate fear of nothingness or perhaps meaninglessness that has gnawed away at the human psyche for eons.<br />Just as Ballard's ancient nuclear test site in The Terminal Beach, replete with its decrepit bunkers and blockhouses, is 'a fossil of Time Future', so too is Eliot's Waste Land a metaphor for the human inability to perceive Time and to merge with the flow of the Universe.<br />A genius?

In truth, we can never know, but in examining the nature of attraction, especially in the light of the 20 year age difference, we are lead into many interesting areas.<br />Katie Roiphe's projection that he finally made the quantum leap into photographing Alice naked, as he had done with other young girls, is not entirely unreasonable. The reclining nude 'study' of Evelyn Hatch is one of the few surviving examples of his child nude phase. Apparently he took a substantial number of child nude photographs, of which only perhaps four have survived.<br />Whether the attraction was based on past-life karma, mere aesthetics or something darker is again unknown. His sexual attraction to an eleven year old Alice is not unthinkable as there is an inevitable level of male biological response to the presence of sexually maturing females, based on a simple reproductive urge. While there is no estrus response as such in humans, there will be other factors, other signals, which trigger attraction and the equivalent of a mating ritual.<br />His attraction of whatever kind to the four year old Alice, is more problematic. Given his ability to think in child-like fantasy terms, as evinced by the books, it may be that at some level, the four year old in Carroll had a simple crush on the young Alice, and that simultaneously he projected her future development into adult form as a possible future soul mate.<br />There is still debate over whether he actually proposed to the eleven year old Alice, and whether this, rather than the nude photography, may have been the final straw for her family.<br />Whatever the reality may have been, Roiphe's story is challenging and well developed, and not entirely unsympathetic to his situation, projected or otherwise. Roiphe's view seems to be that even if he was sexually attracted to her, he did at least control himself.<br />For me, the bottom line in terms of the real world, is that if there is a male hanging around your family 'because he loves children so much', there is a 99% chance he has pedophile tendencies and should not be trusted under any circumstances.<br />The downside of Carroll/Dodgson is that he was a pompous oaf, who wrote very condescendingly about others, imagining that he could charm his way into the lives of an infinite number of young girls and their often witless parents. <br />Was he a calculating monster? I think not. Was he in love with Alice? Yes. Were his attentions and the form they took excessive? Yes.<br />Somewhere in between those who dismiss him as a pedophile and those who would completely whitewash his disturbing obsessions, may well lie the truth.	2004-05-10

There are many excellent and representative photos to accompany the full script and Bruce's superb descriptive rundown on JL which he calls Jacob's Chronicle. <br />This book would be very helpful for anybody who was confused by the movie or parts of the movie, yet who would like to understand more. <br />The only minor blips in the script concern the Vietnam scenes. One point is that (in my copy anyway) he refers to a Field Hospital, yet a soldier in Jacob's shape would have been Dusted Off (air medevaced) to either a Surgical Hospital or an Evacuation Hospital (possibly having gone through the Battalion Surgeon's Forward Aid Station first.) In Nam, the Field Hospital was a larger, longer term care facility, which was more remote from likely action (despite its misleading name.)<br />There is also a memo from Adrian Lyne stating that the movie is set in 1975, &quot;three years after the end of the Vietnam War&quot;. The war officially ended in April 1973.<br />The only other Nam technicality was that where Bruce refers to &quot;two Orderlies&quot; in the script, the men would have actually been Corpsmen (a form of Medic.)<br />Great movie, powerful ending. Read all about it.	2004-05-09

While Catch The Moon is somewhat more linear than I was expecting given the cosmic title, it succeeds as a well-told story of both spiritual and sexual awakening in one's formative teenage years.<br />While I prefer Sue's fascinating Sci Fi/Fantasy Siren Song, this book, seen in perspective, was a very creditable first (published) novel.<br />At a modest 105 pages and less than 30 lines per page, the book is very confrontable for those who may not be big on reading or who are only just beginning to explore the world of the novel.<br />Catch The Moon deals intelligently with some very adult themes - loss, grief, jealousy, betrayal, love and relationships - and while I had guessed the final twist ahead of time, it did not detract from my enjoyment of the story.<br />The haunting title refers to the time when Rina, the main character and narrator, thought she could catch the moon's reflection in her hands and hold it while she made a wish, yet once the water rippled, the moon seemingly shattered into a thousand pieces, as if someone had shattered a dream.<br />In like fashion, her dreams are shattered during the course of the story...	2004-05-02

Oh, that's right, you're dead now, aren't you?<br />Here, untainted by the interference of her unworthy ex, Ted Hughes, is an intense and revealing series of insights into the mind of this most brilliant woman.<br />I came to these journals after reading five volumes of the diaries of Virginia Woolf, and some of the parallels are quite chilling.<br />Whether Plath articulates it or not, the legacy of the Inquisition hangs over her as it has over so many women who are still trying to make sense of a world that is yet to be cleansed of the darker residues of patriarchy. <br />At the time of her suicide in 1963, women had only had been able to vote, own property and inherit property from their fathers for a pitiful 45 years. Incredibly, the centennial of women suffrage will not be until 2018. But of course, that can't be an issue, can it?<br />As for people who desperately manipulate threads of her words to 'prove' that she secretly wanted dependence, hinting that all women secretly crave dependence; consider that if women were naturally dependent on men, the patriarchy would never have needed to set up such a vast number of mechanisms to suppress them.<br />Having read most of her poetry, including the final Ariel poems, and having worked through the journals - a draining experience at times - I still feel Plath's basic Life dilemma is captured in the following hybridized stanza (a merging of lines from two separate stanzas) from Lorelei:-<br />Worse even than your maddening<BR>Song, your silence. At the source<BR>Of your ice-hearted calling...<br />The siren's wail is something primal, something heart-stoppingly elemental. The carrier wave for the Great Song, the Oran Mor of the Celts. It even appears in a similar form in Siddhartha, in the river of a thousand voices, ultimately all converging to form Unity.<br />Like any tortured soul, such as Virginia Woolf - plug in a name - the basic alienation and fear of meaninglessness clearly were there in Plath as with mosthumans, but her Lorelei references also suggested a fear of her own innate primal power. She had a glimpse of something that simply overloaded her circuits, perhaps like the Kundalini experience that led to the poet Shelley's drowning.<br />Yes, there in those lines, we have the dilemma. Which is the more terrible, the Silence or the Song? The fear of nothingness or the crushing tidal wave of everydayness? The entire process of Life. She lived vicariously to some degree, placing far too much importance on her relationship with Ted Hughes. A roving, cheating husband, a man without honor, who was simply not worthy of her, or of any decent woman.<br />Perhaps in her final bleak despair, she forgot that she had existed before him as Sylvia Plath and could have existed after him as Sylvia Plath. She misinterpreted the siren call of her Sisters. They were not calling her down to Death, but to reunification. Ted who? I rather fancy she was the better poet of the two, by a long sea mile.	2004-04-09

This show was as good as it gets, and it never seems to date with time.<br />This book is an invaluable guide to the greatest show/series of all time, and represents oustanding value. The pairing of Dick and Mary was a stroke of genius, and the chemistry between them lifted this brilliantly conceived and well-written series onto another level. Remember the 'Nuts' episode?<br />Even the cutesy touches, such as the way Dick randomly tripped over or side-stepped the ottoman just added to the seemingly endless magic that was the Dick Van Dyke Show.<br />I had been itching to get my paws on this guide ever since I read Mary's autobiography After All, in which she rightly sings the show's praises - they both won Emmys of course - and this Definitive History illustrates just why it was out there on its own.<br />A wonderful book, and absolutely essential for the serious fan of this unique and unforgettable series.	2004-03-21

I doubt if I could ever be as unbiased and methodical as Michel in approaching this shamefully long overdue air campaign, which was the only truly unrestricted heavy strategic air campaign of the entire 10,000 day war, going beyond even Linebacker I, which effectively ended the NVA spring offensive.<br />Though not without its losses (15 of the 26 aircraft lost were B-52s) the results were such that by the end of Linebacker II (which paused on Christmas Day) the USAF had effectively run out of major targets.<br />In the light of so many good overall reviews, I will just focus briefly on the actual bombing ops. It is both disturbing and intriguing to discover the reasons for those losses. While some of the downings were almost 'chance' hits, where the Enemy had fired volleys of SAM-2s ballistically i.e. unguided (due to the ECW assets being employed), many occurred due to precision hits.<br />Where this was the case, it was sometimes due to 'burnthrough', where the Enemy ground radar signal nullified or overwhelmed the ECM cell being generated by the BUFFs. This sometimes occurred due to onboard E/F generator failures (all too common), due to an aircraft straying outside the cell during a maneuver, or in the case of the B-52Gs, simply not having enough ECM power to cope with the signal strength from the SAM site radar emmitters.<br />Six B-52Gs were shot down while making high banking turns at the end of the bombing run, which created an acquirable radar cross section (the plane's ECM was no longer pointing straight downwards, opening up a chink in the electronic armor). After this, the Gs were re-assigned to ARC Light Missions (standard B-52 bombing support missions). Ironically, the older D models had more powerful ECM capabilities. The defense package that they carried included all manner of ECW countermeasures plus onboard chaff dispensers.<br />The external chaff dispensing was also problematic as the high winds were causing the chaff (foil strips) to disperse prematurely and provide too narrow a corridor for the following bombers. Additonal chaffing aircraft (who also flew forward CAP) were allocated and altitude adjustments were made to compensate.<br />At least two MIG 21s were shot down by tail gunners, with their radar directed .50 cal quad packs, as the MIGs were believed to be spotting altitudes and attack vectors for the ground radars. Not too hard when you could see a sea of upper rotating (anti-collision) beacons ahead of you.<br />While the B-52 losses were heavy, the success rate of the SAM-2 in terms of aircraft downed per number of missiles fired was extremely low - perhaps 3 or 4% at the most. The Enemy had basically used up their entire supply of SAM-2s by the end of the campaign, and the last two missions were flown without any losses whatsoever.<br />A great campaign, carried out with tremendous courage and skill by hundreds of B-52 and bomber support crews, (the tankers, the fighter escort, the EW jammer aircraft etc.)and one that actually achieved something in short order. The final Peace accord was signed just a few weeks later.	2004-03-16

This is a real stand up and cheer book for Vets and their friends and families. A two-tour Army Nurse friend recommended it the last time I sent her an email ranting about Wannabees and fakes, and I am most grateful for the suggestion. Thanks, Chris.<br />At a time when Vietnam Vets are finally beginning to receive something like the respect and recognition that they always deserved, this is the time to wage war on those who would cash in by pretending to have served.<br />I am particularly angry with the fakes who have actually managed to receive State help as a result of their false claims. One of my American Red Cross Donut Dollie friends has suffered from PTSD ever since her tour with the 101st Airborne, yet because the ARC-DD girls were technically civilians, they are not entitled to Veteran status. <br />Yet unlike the fakes and liars who try to sponge off the system, the DDs Hueyed around VN, supporting the troops in Fire Support Bases and Landing Zones, which were not the safest places on Earth. Another DD friend, who was with the 1st Infantry, once had such a narrow escape from the VC, that she could feel the door gunner's M-60 casings hitting her legs as she scrambled into the Huey.<br />It is quite chilling to read the level of faking that actually goes on and has been documented. Everything from exaggerating medal earnings and combat records to out and out faking being a Vietnam Vet - in some cases, by draft dodgers, which is perhaps the ultimate insult. From coward to hero with one big lie.<br />We have all met people whose stories don't quite gell - in my own case, I know one guy who is about two years too young to have seen service in Vietnam, and another who was supposedly on one of the hospital ships - about a year after the last one, the Sanctuary, went off station in 1971 (the Repose left in 1970). Uh huh. <br />Some guys even reckoned to have toured in 1975 - quite a feat, considering the US Forces left in April 1973, after a frantic year of troop withdrawals in which the medical services went down to 2 Evac. Hospitals - the 95th and the 71st (after the 24th Evac. left in October 1972) and the US Army Hospital in Saigon. Scary time.<br />Most real Vets can quote their unit down to the Company and platoon level in a flash. Rarely do real Vets mumble something vague about being 'Infantry'. If you'd been with the 25th or the 9th for example, you'd be proud of it, and say so.<br />Yes, the Press have been very gullible in taking a lot of fakes and their lies at face value. Way back in John Kerry's protest days, there was supposedly a demo by 1,000 Vets, many of whom are now thought to have been Left Wing protesters - liars and fakes.<br />Stolen Valor goes a long way towards raising awareness about these worms and in doing so, the authors are defending the honor of the true Vets. The courageous American men and women who EARNED the right to be called Vietnam Vets.	2004-03-15

Proof, if it were needed, that Sci Fi fans are a cut above your average Joe and Josephine.<br />Yes, The Forever War is a Vietnam allegory, and one of the ways in which it succeeds mightily is in the way our hero becomes increasingly alienated from his HomeWorld, and re-enlists. <br />Of the two-tour Vietnam Vets I know, including two Army Nurses, they all said the same thing - that they could no longer identify with the World they had returned to and felt that the familiar madness of Vietnam beckoned them infinitely more.<br />TFW is a fascinating book in the way it portrays the Einsteinian temporal paradoxes and their effects on Earth and Earth Forces in the field, fighting many light years away. The impossibility of having effective real-time command and control from Earth is just one of the factors that makes the war seem pointless.<br />Many Vietnam Vets found that Time seemed to pass at a different rate In Country compared to the States (which they called The World). Only when you entered your Short period, when you got down to your last 99 days, when you became a two-digit midget, or your last 9 days, when you became a one-digit midget, did Time begin to resume any kind of linear perspective.<br />While it's true to say that the only good thing about war is its ending, war is not always futile. When it is undertaken without a very clear attainable objective, i.e. something which makes it 'winnable', such as the Forever War and the Vietnam War, there is a crushing sense of futility, which comes across well in this book.	2004-03-10

I say total, because I found his description of his almost-AWOL phase to be one of the most fascinating parts of the book.<br />Morally and practically, his situation was infinitely more complex than that of a draft dodger, for whom there were known routes into Canada above all, and more clear cut decison processes involved. About 90,000 of the 100,000 draft dodgers fled to Canada, many of whom settled here long-term.<br />Yet as you read Tim's account of his guided tour of hell, you realize that, like all Vietnam Vets, and I have the honor of knowing many of both genders, his healing journey is one that he will not be undertaking alone. Sadly, there was nothing unique about his Vietnam experience, as he would be the first to tell you. <br />At one point, back in the late seventies, there was a statistic indicating that about 800,000 Vietnam Vets - about half the combat vets, were suffering from PTSD. Yet it became obvious that this figure, which did not even include the Army nurses and Docs who sewed everybody back together, was somewhat low. On reading If I Die, you can see how the Vietnam experience could stay with a person for the rest of his/her life, especially in view of the hostility that the Vets faced upon their return to 'The World'.<br />Vietnam was a tremendously divisive issue and the factors that Tim O'Brien had to balance during his almost-AWOL period, make you realize that the actual draft dodgers will also have their own healing to do. The only draft dodgers I have a problem with are the ones who fled to Canada, yet who claim to have done so because of their 'principles'. <br />No. The draft evaders with true integrity and principles either took the courageous step of joining the military as a Medic and refused to carry weapons, or like David Harris, Joan Baez's husband, went to jail for their principles - David was jailed for 3 years for Draft Evasion. The dodgers who ran to Canada did so because they were scared, pure and simple, and there is nothing wrong with being scared. Just don't lie about it - or you will never heal.<br />As for 'principles', if 100,000 people had forced the Government to jail them over the Vietnam issue, as David did, it might have made a difference. It might literally have ended the war years earlier, and saved young men like Tim from having to undergo such a psychologically damaging experience. Running away was a selfish act, but one which I do not judge - that is between them and God. Just don't try to sell me 'principles', boys. Ever.<br />Tim O'Brien is a great writer, and in If I Die, he really puts you in harm's way, among the trip-wire grenades, the panji stake pits, the minefields and the VC snipers. Yet hard as the Vietnam War was on the young draftees, the unforgivable thing is the fact that for many of these teenage soldiers, the hardest part was coming home. To quote from Paul Hardcastle's '19' (the average age of the combat soldier in Vietnam) &quot;They fought the longest war in American history... None of them received a hero's welcome...&quot;<br />Welcome home, Tim.	2004-03-05

I had to get my copy from Amazon UK, but it arrived swiftly and is worth every penny. <br />Anybody who has the double DVD of The Wicker Man, with the interview section, will have some sense of the enormity of the project and the problems that they faced in completing and marketing this classic movie. Allan Brown's superb book obviously goes way beyond that in taking the reader/fan into the very heart of the Wicker Man phenomenon.<br />Everything from the selection of the Locations to the internal politics and squabbling is examined in detail, as is the post-release saga. Brown points out that like any other film, The Wicker Man has its glitches, such as a continuity/editing error in which what appears to be a policeman's leg appears in the cut-to-scene in which the landlord has been left bound and gagged by Howie, in the middle of a later-in-time scene involving the procession. The unknown person's body part enters from the left at the very end of the scene as the camera pans right then left (Use Slow and Step).<br />Similarly, the Fire Dance in which the young women/teenage girls are supposed to be naked was never shot as such because of the restrictions on showing under-aged nudity. So you are left with Summerisle and Howie talking about the children being naked, after a scene in which they are clearly wearing leotards. A ludicrous situation, as the team could have easily used older actresses, which would have been legally and morally acceptable, and the way it was shot, you couldn't tell the age of the actresses anyway. <br />The fact that they didn't re-cast the scene with actual of-age women (the logical choice) is probably symptomatic of the tight schedule that the whole crew was under. This comes across only partially in the DVD documentary, which also barely touches on the conflict between individual team members, some of whom were dissatisfied with Hardy's direction.<br />The book also contains manyexcellent photos, some of which are stills, others being candid off-camera shots. The Appendices are also very useful, ranging from complete cast and crew lists to Location/Scene charts to script excerpts that never made the movie.<br />Brown also refers to the massive cult following that the movie now enjoys, and to fanzines such as Gail Ashurst's Nuada (she also appears in the interview footage on the DVD). Certainly an essential purchase for the serious Wickerphile. <br />At this time there is a rumour that a Wicker Man re-make is being planned for filming in the States with Nick Cage in the starring role, while Robin Hardy's May Day, starring Christopher Lee should also be filmed this year. All hail the Queen of the May.	2004-02-08

This is a welcome return to David's more believable Conspiracy roots, and he mercifully soft pedals the Reptilian stuff. The problem with books like Children of the Matrix is that he made a huge number of totally unsupported claims, based largely on the assumed legitimacy of a group of individuals who claimed to have witnessed many World leaders, including the British monarchy, shape-shifting to and from Alien form and being involved with the ritual slaughter and sexual abuse of children.<br />The whole \\"people are remembering...\\" buzz was incredibly damaging to genuine Conspiracy theorists, many of whom are on the right track, including Icke himself. Which people saw these Reptilians? Are they credible? Have they taken PolyGraph tests? <br />Back to the WTC book, David has raised a lot of interesting points, as you might expect, and there are indeed a lot of unanswered questions. The 'loss' of the Black Box flight recorders and the 'chance' finding of the hijacker's passport in the ruins, is just one example of too-convenient events.<br />Was the whole thing staged? Very hard to say. Because of the covert way the System has always worked, it is hard to obtain true evidence. That the Islamic fundamentalists and their terrorist wings would do something like this and rejoice at the outcome is not in question. Anybody who has spent time in the Middle East knows that many arab countries are extreme patriarchal, Jew-hating dictatorships. No, I'm not a Jew, I have a Celtic ancestry.<br />If David has a problem in his style, it is that he takes an idea which may or not be correct and runs with it and starts pyramiding 'facts' that are derived from that initial piece of assumption. This is how he got into the whole Reptilian Conspiracy thing. <br />Yet the reference to how a Terrorist Insurance scam might have been a factor in the destruction of the Twin Towers leads us to a point that should be considered. Humans have treated each other with a mind-numbing level of callousness and brutality since the beginning. Humans. Humans were quite capable of carrying out the entire attack for their own greedy, psychotic  ends just as they carried out the holocausts in Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, Iraq, North Korea and Communist China. We don't need Aliens to come along and enslave the human race, other humans have already got that under control. It's called the World Banking System.<br />I am not in any way hostile to the idea of Alien lifeforms and their presence on the Earth. I think there is a 99% chance that the Roswell Incident involved the crash of a craft piloted by a non-human intelligence. I think it is entirely likely that the World Government has been fully in contact with Aliens in some form or another for decades. It is also entirely possible that the human race originated on Mars, and that the pyramidal structures in Cydonia, Elysium etc. are a leftover from this period. <br />The mere existence of Aliens on this planet does NOT mean that they are running the show or that all our leaders are Aliens.<br />In Alice In Wonderland David has presented us with the usual mixture of brilliant ideas and research and theoretical stretches that tend to undermine his overall position. As with many things in this world, the Truth is probably somewhere in between the theorizing and the apparent realities.	2004-01-31

Their concern is that not only would the code not be XHTML compliant (the standard for the future that is being implemented now), but that some of the code simply would not run on some browsers.<br />Swoon... I needed a quick fix book that would explain enough about XML and XHTML for me to go in and manually convert the Composer-generated HTML code for XHTML compliance. I also needed to be able to use a checking tool to verify that the altered/upgraded code would pass the test.<br />Thank goodness for Michael's book. My first bonus was discovering that Netscape 7.1 actually generates HTML 4.1 code, which is basically current. My second bonus was finding that Michael has a very readable style and gets to the point quickly. To be honest, I just speed scanned the vast majority of the book and used it as a reference guide while I dove in almost immediately to perform the XHTML conversion.<br />The way MM explains things, the conversion was a very simple process, and the icing on the cake is that he explains how to use the WC3 Validator online free checking service, which allows you to safely and simply upload your source code for a given web page, and have it checked in real time. One cute bonus from the Validator site is that when your code passes the test, you can download an icon indicating that your code for that page is XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant.<br />I'm sure there are many good books out there of a similar nature, but for me, this book by Michael Morrison works for people who just want to get in there quickly and do it. Like many busy men and women, I don't have time to read War and Peace, and MM appears to understand that need for speed and clarity.<br />Finally, while there is some breezy humor and a very friendly feel to the book, it does not descend into the infantile 2 cent jokes and puns that some books have been known to contain.<br />Excellent.	2003-11-09

Not that Jane Urquhart intended it to be, but it so outstrips Return To Wuthering Heights by Anna L'Estrange that it cannot help but unwittingly assume that mantle.<br />Whereas L'Estrange's sequel is a fairly linear novel, which continues the saga through the lives of Heathcliffe and Catherine's descendants, Hareton and young Cathy, Urquhart gets inside Bronte's head and brings us the spirit of her creation, rather than the mere mechanics.<br />Urquhart's stunning grasp of Emily Bronte's psyche is echoed in Camille Paglia's own cracking assessment of Bronte and her work in the magnificent Sexual Personae. Here, in Paglia's analysis of Bronte's self-referential high romantic prose poem, she writes of how the Byronic Heathcliffe is both Bronte's own projected animus (put simplistically, her Jungian Inner Male component) and in the context of the story, Cathy's as well. <br />This metathesis, or literary transsexualization comes across in Urquhart's own brilliant re-weaving of the Brontean strands. Yet, such is the subtlety of Jane's unfoldment, that the female characters, including Emily Bronte (in spirit form, as is Arianna Ether) seem almost peripheral to the calculatedly one-dimensional, self-indulgent male characters. Such of course, is the history of patriarchy, in which women have traditionally been the Second Sex.<br />The only exception to the male group thus defined is the character Hartley, who, by comparison is an almost Shamanic figure - a man in balance, who has surrendered to the wisdom of the eternal Feminine.<br />I believe that Jane Urquhart has captured the elemental genius of Bronte's original work, with its relatively anarchic temporal shifting and box structure, in particular Bronte's deliberate use of the singular form of 'heaven' (in a related poem), rather than 'the heavens', which would be a more common choice when writing about the weather, the sky etc. The changing heaven is the changing Heaven,and the use of weather as a metaphor in Wuthering Heights, and therefore Changing Heaven, reminds you of the tornado in The Wizard of Oz, which again represented a vortex, connecting the worlds at the opposite ends of the labyrinth. Yin and Yang, Life and Death, Masculine and Feminine etc.<br />Yet, as Dorothy discovered, when you have truly found yourself, Oz is Kansas. She never left, she merely transformed. Similarly, the temporal convergence that finally connects the female divine Trinity in Jane's epic work is a simliar point of transcendence, and resolution.<br />I was so impressed by Changing Heaven that I even mentioned it at a pivotal point in my own impending modern gothic novel 'One Star Awake', and in my first work of non-fiction, Sirius Moonlight - concerning the suppression of the Feminine in patriarchal culture - such is the influence that Urquhart's mistresspiece has had on me - likewise, with Camille Paglia.<br />Even the inspired act of latching onto the Bronte poem's phrase 'changing heaven' and relating it to the absolute core of Wuthering Heights, is a measure of Jane Urquhart's own genius.<br />I simply cannot recommend this wonderful book highly enough.	2003-10-29
US	48151595	R1A3FDVALM4WCZ	0764516434	598251304	Creating Web Pages For Dummies (For Dummies (Computers))	Books	4	54	61	N	N	Definitely worth the cash, but...	A great starter book that will get you up and running with a good personal web page or site (multiple connected pages) in a short time, or even a basic business site.<br />One staggeringly DUMB thing is that the first reference to a web SITE rather than merely a page is on page 11. No mention on the cover either. Most people are more familiar with the term web site than web page, so this is a very questionable omission, which may have cost them book sales.<br />If the book has a weakness, it is that it places too much emphasis on catering for older generation browsers, suggesting that Netscape Composer will build pages that older browsers will usually be able to read. Although, even here, I'm not so sure they are correct. <br />I created a basic read-only multi-page site in Composer under Netscape 7.1 and when I looked at the HTML source code, it was using HTML 4.1, (i.e. current HTML) and by the fact that it mentioned DTD's (Document Type Definitions), it must be leaning in an XML direction. However, by the fact that it did not generate an end slash after the (empty) &quot;br&quot; (line break) tag, for example, it does not go all the way to being XHTML compatible.<br />One problem here is that 95-97% of surfers will not have older generation browsers, and to compromise going ahead with XML and ultimately, XHTML standards (the ONLY way to go for the future) will not be helpful to you or your web host. <br />Many web hosts wince if you say you have built a web site in Composer, and whine about 'inelegant code'. What they are really talking about is forward compatability i.e. dragging web design and Net standards out of the stone age. <br />It is definitely advisable to manually convert any generated code to XHTML format and use a checking tool such as WC3 Validator, which I don't think this book even mentions.<br />It also fails to adequately distinguish between the nature of a read-only website and a fully interactive one, with a MYSQL database. It does mention that any add-on such as forms necessarily includes data storage and it does mention CGI and Perl (server-end software), but the detail in this area is somewhat lacking.<br />These are not heavy criticisms on my part. I love the For Dummies series, and this is a very good basic book. It will certainly suffice for most people, in that many of the explanations of the basics are excellent. Just a few tweaks and it would have been perfect. <br />Oh, what the heck, give 'em a seegar anyway.	2003-10-25

There will still be those who claim to doubt Greer's conclusions and even the existence of Aliens, but who cares?<br />The skeptics and their infantile resistance are now completely irrelevant. The existence of Aliens, to use a catch-all term, is a no-brainer - it is not in question.<br />The question is, can we deal with the full implications of Disclosure?<br />It is one thing to begin to introduce the previously suppressed New Technologies in order to help out the human race and accelerate the healing of the planet, but quite another to come clean about the full extent of the Alien presence.<br />Way back in the sixties, the Brookings Institute concluded that the human race was just too primitive and spiritually immature to deal with the introduction of an Alien race, however benign. Many UFO buffs have dismissed those findings, because they themselves were totally ready for Contact. I agree. Most UFO buffs ARE ready, and have been for decades. <br />And then there's the rest of humanity.<br />The burning of Harry Potter books - a children's fantasy - was a very serious reminder that even the slightest threat to certain people's religious belief systems can trigger madness. And if you think that was just a few nuts, think again.<br />Real live Aliens, with their archetypally demonic appearance are a little up the scale from Joanne Rowling's roly-poly fictional characters.<br />Yes, the human race has a right to know, but whether they should be told at this point in their evolution, is quite another matter. Believe me, the control groups who have had direct Contact have not fared very well, and the idea of unleashing a Pandora's Box of global hysteria - a one-way thing - has to be taken very seriously.<br />Before anybody thinks I am spouting Disinformation, nothing could be further from the truth. We just need to approach the idea of letting the humans intothe light with extreme caution. Steven has written a remarkable book, but the greatest emphasis now needs to be on how do we approach final Disclosure, and more importantly, when.<br />After the insult of the Roswell denials, many of us are just itching for the Government to come clean and admit to their vast catalog of lies. But not at any price, guys. It can't be at any price.	2003-10-17

Read this book, plus the late Lynda Van Devanter's Home Before Morning and you'll see why.<br /><br />While Lynda's book is a hauntingly graphic record of the triumphs and tragedies that the ANC nurses and Army surgeons experienced in Nam, A Piece Of My Heart gives the reader a very broad perspective of the contributions of women in many other areas.<br /><br />The foreword to the book was written by the wonderful Martha Raye, whose unflinching commitment to the men and women who served in Nam led to her being a two-time Purple Heart recipient. That even an entertainer could be wounded twice in the line of duty speaks volumes about the risk level In Country.<br /><br />Equally, Civilian Flight Attendant Micki Voisard almost met her end when her airliner almost collided with a B-52 that was maintaining radio silence during an airstrike.<br /><br />Yet even though the Red Cross Donut Dollies, such as Penni Evans and \\"Sam\\" Bokina Christie and WACs such as Doris Allen all have compelling stories to relate, it is the experiences of the nurses that really stay with you, long after you have put the book down.<br /><br />For most of her post-Nam life, former ANC nurse and author Lynda Van Devanter (Home Before Morning - available through Amazon.com) was haunted by the memory of a young soldier who had no face, and who eventually had to be left to die because of the extent of his injuries.<br /><br />When you read the piece by Anne Simon Auger (91st Evac. - Chu Lai) you realize that injuries of that magnitude were not as uncommon as you might hope and pray. Anne also described a young soldier whose face had been shot away, leaving him blind and in her words, \\"a vegetable\\".<br /><br />While my own view is that people in such terrible physical condition should be given enough morphine to shut down their breathing, or in the absence of that, on the battlefield, a mercy round from an M-16, I fully accept that however you have to deal with such shocking injuries, it will stay with you for the rest of your life.<br /><br />Let us not forget that while the returning troops were being blamed for the war and openly called \\"baby killers\\", thousands of young American women were risking their own lives to support the largely teenaged US soldiers in a war that increasingly made no sense to the people who were being asked to fight it.<br /><br />These women were Vets. These women were heroes. These women were angels.<br /><br />We must constantly seek ways to honour them. Their sacrifice must never be forgotten.	2003-03-16

After a difficult life, haunted by the horrors of war and a tendency towards drinking problems, doubtless caused by Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, it seems that Ms. Van Devanter's terminal condition may have been a reaction to the chemical agents and defoliants used in Nam.<br />Home Before Morning gives the reader some idea of the mind-numbing daily grind of caring for wounded and dying soldiers - translation = 18 and 19 year old kids, that the ANC nurses and at times Red Cross SRAO Donut Dollies faced in Vietnam.<br />Though some of her former colleagues criticized the book as being sensationalist and a vehicle for her subsequent anti-war stance, (one former ANC officer claimed that it portrayed the nurses as \\"bed-hopping, foul mouthed tramps\\"), other Nam Nurses have described the book as 'mild' and an understatement of the horror, madness and heartbreak that was daily life in Vietnam.<br />What we can be sure of is that the 10,000 ANC Nurses and Red Cross SRAO staff who served in Vietnam were true blue American heroes, and should have been recognized as Vets from Day One. Anybody who reads Lynda's book and \\"Battle Dressing\\" by Dusty (ANC nurse Dana Shuster) will come away with a sense of reverence for these wonderful women. While Communist-inspired mindless morons back in the USA were calling the returning soldiers \\"baby killers\\" and \\"murderers\\", thousands of women of integrity were risking their own lives to provide a level of combat medical care in which the survival rate was a totally unheard of 82%.<br />Fittingly, Lynda dedicated her book to the memory of 1/L Sharon Ann Lane, the first woman to be killed by direct enemy action in Nam (312th Evac at Chu Lai), \\"...and all of the unknown women who served, forgotten in their wars\\".<br />If you know of a woman who served in Vietnam, please do or say something to show that you appreciate her courage and sacrifice. Even if it is just to say the one thing that the returning troops and Nam Nurses never heard. <br />Welcome home.	2003-01-26

Call me a Right Winger (You're a Right Winger, Steve) but this guy dragged the Presidency through its lowest trough since Watergate.<br />As if the pitiful \\"tried Pot but didn't inhale\\" fiasco didn't tell us what kind of man, or was it lying toad, we were dealing with, he tops it all off by betraying his wife and disgracing his Office by obtaining Executive Relief from a cheap tramp in the dang White House itself.<br />The shameful lack of condemnation from various Liberal factions speaks volumes about their collective integrity. Coulter quite rightly nails Billy Bob on this issue, which was a double moral outrage, but also on major concerns such as Whitewater.<br />Her case for impeachment is unassailable, especially given her own Legal background, and the limping dog denials by the Clinton Right Or Wrong brigade do nothing to diminish the strength of Ann's arguments.<br />This is a very important book, but the ultimate Coulter Classic is Slander: Liberal Lies About The American Right, which was understandably an Amazon best seller. There's not much to stand up and cheer about in this world, but Ann Coulter's books certainly fill the bill.	2003-01-12

While it is empirical that Stalin made Hitler look like a nancy boy, the post-Stalinist Russia remained a War-based economy that relied on mass slave labour. A gulag is a gulag and a bully is a bully.<br />Yet even though The Ron achieved a great deal in his own right, the book recognizes that it was his partnership with Margaret Thatcher, whom the Russkies termed \\"The Iron Maiden\\", that drove the final well-deserved nail into the Soviet coffin.<br />The combination of the Star Wars defence programme and the deployment of Cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe, coupled with the total resolve of Reagan and Thatcher simply crushed the Russian Government's spirit. <br />The book does not really explore the extent to which The Ron may have exaggerated the extent of the Soviet threat, although it it clearly better to over-estimate an enemy than the reverse. You can never have too many anti-tank missiles.<br />I recall from military intelligence sources back in the seventies that there was a concensus that the Russian troops in the Soviet Bloc countries were garrison troops and that the populations detested the Russians even more than we did. For this reason, many analysts secretly felt that any Soviet attack on Western Europe would break up during the first 48 hours, partly due to the sheer decimation of Russian armour (even without Tac Nukes), and that this would quickly precipitate the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br />Whether Ron knowingly exaggerated \\"Soviet\\" power or not, he certainly beefed up NATO to a point where the enemy could no longer compete, especially in the sphere of hi-tech weaponry.<br />A great book about a great man, who ended the Russian reign of terror in Eastern Europe.	2002-12-30

As a father of four, I would take my helmet off to Thompson and hope that I would have done the same thing in those circumstances.<br />However, as a jumpy eighteen-year-old who had spent three months seeing his buddies slaughtered in booby trap after booby trap, having their heads blown off by snipers you never see or get to track, Army trucks full of draftees decimated by grenades thrown by smiling elderly villagers and children, I really don't know how much I would have given a damn for any village anywhere in that country.<br />Yes, the massacre was wrong, and thank God for men like Thompson, but if anybody is going to judge My Lai or any other total breakdown of discipline and artificially-sustained morality, it should be men and women who have served in extreme combat environments, not bourgeois middle-class Liberals who have never had to get their hands dirty.<br />Vietnam was a filthy war, and because it never had a distinct purpose or Win Scenario driving it, it was a pointless war. Ironically, one of the things that triggered My Lai was the very fear and frustration generated by the VC's own tactics, including the mutilation of American corpses and the constant goading and provocation that GI's had to endure.<br />This was the same Enemy that massacred French garrisons and lined the approach roads with the severed heads of the defenders to demoralize the relief columns. The same Enemy that even booby trapped live babies in order to kill American soldiers and shock them into a state of psychological collapse.<br />Read the book, by all means, and be outraged. Yet while the massacre can never be justified, with the kind of background, only some of which I have just outlined, it can perhaps be understood - above all, as others have rightly said, in the absence of strong leadership and the stability provided by having a good sprinkling of experienced Vets throughout the Company.<br />No, it should never have happened, but then, neither should the War.	2002-12-10

By the time of the final French collapse, the area left in their hands was virtually the size of a baseball diamond.<br />This book, along with End Of The Line:The Seige Of Khe Sanh, is absolutely essential reading for anybody who wants to understand some of the key differences between the Western and Vietnamese approaches to combat and politics.<br />While nobody could doubt the courage of the French soldiers, who were plunged into a cauldron of Death by a group of arrogant and totally out of touch leaders, you cannot fail to admire the courage and skill of a relentless and ingenious Enemy.<br />The idea of setting up a base in a remote valley to draw in Enemy units and destroy them, was fatally flawed for several reasons. As the book shows, one of them being the failure to conceive of the VM's ability to deploy significant numbers of artillery pieces and anti-aircraft units so quickly and so far away.<br />Yet the real nail in the French coffin lay in the fact that unlike the British and Americans, the French had no strategic heavy bombers. By comparison, the Air operation (Operation Niagara) in support of the Marine garrison at Khe Sanh in 1968 (during the Tet offensive) began with a strike by 36 B-52 bombers, each carrying a 30 ton payload.<br />The small single-engined French planes could barely carry any weapons load, especially at such extreme range. Even then, they often fell prey to the radar-predicted flak that nobody believed the VM could deploy. Naturally, it was all courtesy of the Communist Chinese.<br />Fall gives you a tremendous overview of the entire disaster, from the political machinations to the ghastly conditions on the base. One of the commanders who had refused extra artillery before the main battle began, shot himself. The desperate measures employed by the French included dropping two tanks in pieces, which the Army engineers assembled on the ground, and which caused havoc among the VM until they were overwhelmed by suicide squads, firing point blank into the observation slits and rolling grenades down the barrels of the guns.<br />Hell indeed. Not just for the troops, but for the hopelessly overworked doctor, who had to crawl over a pile of amputated limbs to reach his bunk.<br />As another reviewer mentioned, the French finally had to beg for US air support, and while the US decided not to commit carrier-based strike aircraft (they also decided against a tactical nuclear strike because of the danger to French troops), they did provide the French with a squadron of B-26's, two of which were shot down on the first raid by radar-controlled flak, at 10,000 feet. While these bombers may have made some difference had they arrived much earlier, the writing was really on the wall from Day One.<br />A disaster, yes, and it should have been a wake up call. The clowns who sent US troops into Nam in the early sixties should have known that you cannot fight a vague holding operation against such a resourceful and fanatical enemy. The only reason the US fatalities did not far exceed 58,000 is because of the massive tactical and strategic air support that the French simply never had. Equally, the US helicopter force provided a level of mobility and close air support that simply did not exist at the time of Dien Bien Phu. The same helicopters saved countless lives by (usually) rapidly evacuating wounded to field hospitals where they could receive urgently needed surgery.<br />Imagine Vietnam without the Hueys, the B-52's, the Phantoms, the Skyraiders, the AC-130's, the miniguns, the firebases, the Daisy Cutters, the cluster munitions, the Fuel-Air bombs, the napalm, the phosporous, the satellite photographs, the U-2 and SR-71 flights, the night vision equipment, the armoured units, the God-bless-'em-all men AND women who sewed everybody back together, and you will have some idea of what the French boys faced at Dien Bien Phu.<br />As somebody else rightly said, it's a pity none of the US \\"planners\\" ever actually read anything about the French experience.<br />An essential book.	2002-12-10

So said the late and great Ronnie Van Zant in the intro to Sweet Home Alabama, and he was right.<br />It is obscene and a total distortion of reality to describe the Confederate Flag as a \\"racist symbol\\". Don Hinkle has certainly done us proud with this much-needed boost for the good people of The South.<br />The supreme irony is that by attempting to ban the Confederate Flag (anti-Flag pedants please note, my capitalization is deliberate) they will turn it into a rallying symbol for every WASP who has had enough of being blamed for all of the evils of the world.<br />Proportionally speaking, very few whites have openly supported the KKK and other Right Wing groups. Yet with a Communist-inspired \\"Liberal\\" onslaught on the Confederate Flag, lines are bound to become blurry. <br />Yes, slavery was wrong, we've all figured that out, and if we hadn't been deliberately undermined by reckless and subversive immigration policies, black and white integration would have taken place much more rapidly.<br />The number of lies about The Racist South are equalled only by the pitiful attempts to deify thugs such as Lincoln, whose War Of Northern Aggression only belatedly and incidentally embraced the slavery issue. As another reviewer correctly observed, it was about taxation and the suppression of The South.<br />Good job, Don.

To me, that willingness does not come across in Posner's book. <br /> <br />If this book has an overall weakness, it is Posner's tendency to accept official data at face value, including ballistic and medical evidence, and even the audio tape on which he alleges you can hear the shots and their time frame. One of the big problems here, is that this does not take into account the use of silenced weapons, which would have unquestionably been used in the event of an actual conspiracy. The way Posner dismisses this viable scenario is quite disturbing. <br /> <br />We can simply never know what was in Oswald's head, including how a non-sniper could expect to not only hit but kill Kennedy, route knowledge or not, with a non-specialized, unsilenced bolt-action rifle in a time window that barely even allowed time for a second ACCURATE shot, let alone a third - given the physical and psychological time needed to re-acquire the moving HUMAN target.  <br /> <br />We also do not know how he could have possibly expected to escape, having used a non-silenced weapon, multiple floors up in a building located in an area containing so many police and security personnel. <br /> <br />Oswald may have believed he was acting alone, but whether he in fact was, we can never really know. To say 'cased closed' is simply too brash in the light of the known and proven CIA/FBI tendencies to chaff the public. <br /> <br />The attitude of 'if there is no evidence of a given scenario, it can't have happened' is naive and arrogant in the extreme.  <br /> <br />I am not saying Posner is necessarily wrong, merely that his determination to write the definitive Kennedy assassination debunking book has blinkeredhis thinking.	2002-11-24

Having had that experience, I am not about to believe any of the Communist propaganda that is designed to make us feel guilty for recognizing the truth in all this chaos.<br />While I respect Pat's views, I'm not sure the Pill itself has been the problem, more that the birth rate amongst Asians in particular has been so out of control. Contrasted with a static or slightly declining White European population, this is set to cause a dramatic social imbalance.<br />Ironically, it is the very state of the world that puts many young couples off the idea of having children. Stronger, more coherent leadership might encourage some of these people to go ahead and start families, but that is yet to manifest.<br />One of the reasons that the Left have had some successes in discrediting serious analysts such as Pat B is that Joe McCarthy went over the top in his earlier Communist bashing. Not that he was wrong to bash Communist traitors, but that in his clumsy fashion, he also targeted patriotic gays and Jews, who were in no way a threat to the United States.<br />Extrapolating from Pat's ideas, it seems quite likely that uncontrolled immigration from non-white, non-English-speaking countries has been a calculated act of subversion by the Communists who have been trying to undermine the Western power base for decades.<br />We do not have integrated, cosmopolitan societies. We have racial and political chaos. Anybody who tries to convince you otherwise is selling you a lie. There is clearly nothing wrong with immigration per se. It only becomes a problem when there is no attempt to integrate the incoming groups or monitor their numbers, and avoid the creation of social enclaves or ghettos. <br />Perhaps the final folly is the latest move to ban the Confederate flag, under the guise of it being a \\"racist\\" symbol. Yet far from removing it, they will simply make it a rallying image for every WASP who has had enough of being pushed into the background and being blamed for all the evils of the world. It will forge alliances between groups of Whites who would not normally link up. I say \\"folly\\", because the idea of it being a racist symbol could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br />Like Pat, I am not a racist, just a realist. If a man was prepared to crawl through a minefield under heavy fire and bang a morphine needle into my chest, I couldn't give a dang whether he was black, gay or whatever.<br />Immigration is completely out of control and has been for decades. Whether apparency or reality, there is a widespread belief that alien groups are coming to North America and dictating to the white European and African-American populations who built the countries, what they will and will not accept and what laws they will and will not obey. All people should have equal rights. Nobody should be \\"more equal\\" than anybody else. You wouldn't expect to be able to open a liquor store in Saudi Arabia. The entire situation doesn't make sense, and at least Pat has the guts to stand up and say something.	2002-11-23

Really, you just can't throw phrases like that out there and expect to be taken seriously. Similarly, Gerald Posner claimed to have closed the JFK case, by \\"proving\\" that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Nonsense.<br />With the Ripper case, the sheer age of the case and the questionable quality of the evidence, such as it is, makes it totally impossible to do more than make a series of educated guesses. <br />Pat Cornwell has put forward some interesting ideas, although her non-definitive DNA \\"evidence\\" is somewhat misleading and as for handwriting \\"experts\\"... well, yeah.<br />The most fascinating thing about the Jack The Ripper case is why it has been so compelling for so many people. If the case really did only consist of five murders, in a city in which all human life was cheap, especially among the poor, why should it have taken on such an enduring mystique?<br />Apart from the favoured-by-some Royal Conspiracy theories, one of the most unique elements in the JTR murders was the incremental level of violence that the killer used. By the final murder, in which the greatest level of mutilation was employed, Jack had played himself out in terms of his ability to layer more horror on the police and townsfolk of Whitechapel. <br />Sickert could have easily been the Ripper. Yet, any one of a dozen suspects could have done it, either singly or with an accomplice. While reading Cornwell's book, the most chilling thought that occured to me was that virtually ANYBODY could have been the killer. <br />We will never know why the Ripper killed those apparently innocent women, or why he used a mind-boggling level of mutilation on the fifth victim. What we can be sure of is that given sufficient cause, most people could unleash similar violence on a \\"deserving\\" party. I have only experienced this unparalleled hatred for an enemy once in my life, when I was being hounded by a sadistic Collection Agency (they are ALL sadistic). At the peak of the harassment, I knowcompletely that I would definitely have used a Ripper-level of violence and brutality against certain individuals, had they appeared in front of me, instead of hiding behind a false Desk Name, at the other end of a telephone. In dehumanizing me, they dehumanized themselves. This then, is perhaps the key to understanding our fascination with this unfettered use of violence.<br />Whether the Ripper was a misogynist, a contract killer employed by the Royals, a deranged psychopath or whatever, he carried out a short series of violent acts that seemed to wound the fabric of Time itself. More than anything, he showed us the Dark Side that lurks in too many people. Perhaps all people. Just waiting to be triggered. Just waiting to bring Him back, from Hell.<br />No, the case is not closed, and it never will be.	2002-11-17

While \\"kill 'em all\\" may be an extreme reaction, this book offers a number of highly satisfying solutions to the problem of persecution by the goose-stepping thugs of the world of debt collection.<br />This book, along with Dover and Donovan's Back Off! empowers the reader with a vast quantity of information so that a victim may make informed decisions in dealing with their debt situation. <br />While the finer points of the Law apply to the American Justice System, the principles may be applied in virtually any democracy. One of the most useful things about this book is that it explains the structure of the organizations and the PSYCHOLOGY of debt collection. Knowing your enemy is 90% of the battle.<br />I would like to expand on the psychological aspects of the debt collection process. In my own experience, in which I was being hounded by a Canadian-based collection agency (some years ago), I noticed that they often use female collectors. This, plus the TONE OF VOICE used by these women is the key to the darker side of collection practices.<br />All people usually subconsciously associate women with nurturing and the Mother figure. By the female debt collectors using a Standard Harsh Callous Unfeeling Cruel Debt Collector Tone Of Voice, they are deliberately trying to trigger a fear and panic response in their victims. This parallels the experiments in which female monkeys have had their facial nerves severed so that they cannot show emotion via facial expression, which causes extreme distress and panic in their babies. <br />Debt collection, as it is usually practiced, is one of the most disgusting and utterly cruel practices in Western society. Many people have literally been driven to suicide by these monsters. Others have simply given up and declared bankruptcy, although as we see, this does not necessarily end the harassment. More than a few bailiffs have been shot dead by desperate debtors, and it is surely only a matter of time before somebody adopts a TimMcVeigh solution to the problem of harassment.<br />This wonderful book clearly shows that it needn't come to this. Before you strap on ninety pounds of C-4 and six inch nails, please read this superb study. Not only will it be more satisfying to use the System to defeat these callous bullies, you'll even live to see the fruits of your actions!<br />Please do not consider my above comments to be flippant. I know what went through my own mind during my darkest hours of persecution. While I was able to clear my own debts by getting a consolidation mortgage, there are many people who do not have this option, and for them, desperate measures will surely beckon.<br />In the post-911 world, even debt collectors should be reflecting on their mortality. I urge you to arm yourselves with knowledge, not propylene oxide. Buy this book, and Back Off!, and beat the bullies at their own game. Nuke the system, not the building!	2002-11-02

Finally somebody who actually knows what he's talking about. GB obviously walks the walk, and his passion for the subject has enabled him to write a virtually flawless meisterwerk, which should become the standard Goth reference book.<br />This is a first class piece of research, and while I am primarily interested in the musical side of Goth, it was also fascinating to read Gavin's insights into Gothic influences in art, theatre and film.<br />This is so comprehensive that few people should be able to say, \\"Oi, you forgot to mention...\\" The Hunger? It's in here. Bauhaus? Yep, a no-brainer. Gavin encompasses even fringe bands and artists, such as camp Cabaret-style vamps such as Marc Almond, punkish Adam Ant (pre and post transition to the Dandy Highwayman) and The Cure, who in my opinion mainly qualify because of Robert's time with Siouxsie. At the other end of Fringe, GB also includes Black Metal/Goth band Cradle Of Filth, whose Her Ghost In The Fog video is a must-see.<br />This modern Goth/Pop Culture classic mentions literally all of my favourite bands, ranging from Bauhaus and Type O Negative, to more melodic Goth acts such as The Mission (UK), Switchblade Symphony (you HAVE to hear Serpentine Gallery), the impossibly beautiful Katharine Blake's Miranda Sex Garden and The Shroud.<br />This masterpiece is also packed with excellent photographs, many of which I have never seen before. I simply cannot fault it.	2002-10-23

As Alan Watts puts it, This Is It.<br />Logical paradoxes aside, the &quot;just shut up and get on with it&quot; approach to Life is one of the key elements in Zen. The 'kill the Buddha' psychology of avoiding the pitfalls of externally arising enlightenment is well in line with Watt's own philosophy.<br />Completeness comes from within and from a place of non-duality, which the koans of Zen are designed to lead you towards. One of the key human errors and the cause of immense suffering is the belief that Life must make sense. Who ever said that? And make sense to whom?<br />The Techno Bible in The Hitch Hiker's Guide bore the words &quot;Dont Panic&quot; on the cover. That's a good starting point. Add to that Just Do It and This Is It, and you're going to be just fine.<br />Another great read from the man who gave us The Two Hands Of God.	2002-09-13

While I accept that there may be flaws in some of Temple's basic assertions, and that earlier cultural contamination may have sown the seed of the Dogon &quot;binary&quot; mythology, the book is still a fascinating read.<br />Even if the Dogon had been contacted by Westerners before the original reports of their &quot;Sirius binary&quot; theory were made, it is an odd piece of data for them to discuss, let alone latch onto and distort into a tribal mythology. The suggestion that some of the modern Dogon are not aware of this Alien/Sirius legend does not automatically mean that the Dogon at the time of the first interview could not have relayed the story as Temple portrays it. There may be many reasons why the tribal teachings may have subsequently suppressed this information. Possible flaws or not, nobody can conclusively disprove Temple's basic theories, so the book is likely to endure.<br />For example, I could suggest that J.M. Barrie used the concept of Sirius being a binary star in his directions to Never Land in Peter Pan (second star to the right and straight on till morning). Pan was written before the confirmation of the reality of the twin star system, yet the idea of such an important star being a binary could easily have come to Barrie in a moment of inspiration. Again, nobody could disprove the idea, especially as the worlds of the Spirit and Quantum Reality Theory are moving ever closer together.<br />Temple's original suggestion that Sirius, the Star of Isis in Templar and masonic legend, may also in fact be a triple star system, including a Sirius C, now seems to be in the process of being confirmed, astronomically. This adds even more weight to his arguments.<br />I'm sure Temple's book will be debated for decades to come, but whatever is the case, it remains an important study and a highly entertaining read.<br />Regarding the later NASA photographs of the Face at Cydonia, which supposedly disprove the existence of a Sphinx-like &quot;face&quot;, Ipersonally think they reek of digital manipulation and are about as convincing as the US Government's Roswell denials.<br />Humans...

Not my words. They were the words of a modern-day Luftwaffe squadron leader, who I had the pleasure of meeting back in the seventies. His point was that nobody in their right mind could in any way justify the Holocaust. As Denying History goes on to prove, nobody in their right mind could in any way justify Holocaust denial.<br />At the (for me) prohibitive price, I would never have bought the book, but a friend lent me his copy, for which I am most grateful. Shermer leads an unassailable destruction of the various denial approaches, from those who question the figure of six million, to the extremists who deny that there ever was a Holocaust. <br />On a personal note, I grew up in Britain as a non-Jew, and one of my neighbours, a Mr. Hammill, was a Survivor. In the summer, when everybody slept with their windows open, you could sometimes hear him screaming in his sleep. Literally.<br />The capacity for genocide is inherent in humans. To deny that, to deny that it DID happen to the Jews, is just the first step towards creating the basis for the next Holocaust. Denying History goes as far as is humanly possible in proving that the Jewish Holocaust did actually happen, and that virtually all of those who question the reality, have agendas of their own.	2002-07-25
US	48151595	R27DDZLTWTKDNQ	0964489538	436760844	Circumcision, The Hidden Trauma : How an American Cultural Practice Affects Infants and Ultimately Us All	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Europa Europa...	A very erudite and compassionate work. Having grown up in Europe as a non-Jew, I was stunned to discover the extent of routine circumcision among non-Jews in North America, especially the USA.<br />The classic movie Europa Europa exemplifies the degree to which European attitudes differ from those in the US. In EE, a young Jewish guy inadvertently ends up in a WWII Hitler Youth group and therefore has to hide the fact of his circumcision to the nth degree - simply because in Europe (even now) only Jewish boys are routinely circumcized.<br />The main modern argument in favour of circumcision is that there is a lesser chance of one's female partner developing cervical cancer etc. if the foreskin has been removed. Yet, as a man who has been married for more than 20 years, it is quite clear to me that provided proper cleanliness is maintained, the woman is at no more risk than she would be from having intercourse with a circumcized male.<br />This book is absolutely essential reading. The bottom line, is that unless there are deeply felt religious considerations in your family, FORGET IT! You only need to surf the Men's Movenment groups to see how outraged thousands of men feel about their unthinking abuse at the hands of their unthinking parents and a soulless system that just runs on automatic.<br />Quite brilliant.	2002-07-20

While the Man's erudition is mighty, I have a few concerns about Robert's portrayal of women.<br />If there is a flaw in his thinking, it is that he seems to suggest that strength and femininity are mutually exclusive qualities.<br />Tell that to victorious War leaders Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir and Indira Gandhi. <br />Tell that to Queen Boadicea, who fought to the death against the Roman invaders.<br />Tell that to Queen Elizabeth I, who defied the oncoming Spanish Armada, as she told her assembled troops - \\"I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field...\\". <br />Tell that to French Resistance leader Lucie Aubrac, who planned and led a successful assault on the Nazi convoy that was taking her husband to his place of execution - even though she was five months pregnant at the time. She gave birth to her daughter within days of landing at a covert operations base in England, after the Aubracs had hidden for three months, waiting to escape.<br />Tell that to the female US fighter and bomber crews, who have been flying combat missions since the nineties.<br />Perhaps Robert's most worrying suggestion is that mothers cannot give boys the \\"hardness\\" they need while growing up without sacrificing their femininity, and the idea that a mother's influence can be undermining to a young male's development in the absence of a strong father figure. Yet mythology (Perseus, Parsifal etc.) and real life are full of male figures who became the epitome of virile masculinity, despite being brought up by a single mother or a group of women. One notable modern example being ultra-macho Rocker John Kay of Steppenwolf, who made a daring escape from Communist-held East Germany with his single mother, Elsbeth, in 1948. In his autobiography \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\", Kay is quick to honour her and women in general, precisely because they CAN simultaneously provide nurturing and strength.<br />Robert Bly is not alone infalling into these gender bias traps. Many male (and female) authors do. For this reason, I have always worked with a female editor. However, I would still recommend the book very highly, despite this one blind spot. After all, we don't have Battered Women's Shelters because of men like Robert Bly and Alan Alda.	2002-06-17

Bradbury's Neo-Pagan/Quantum Reality view of the universe is presented here in a truly spellbinding allegory. <br />However one interprets the metaphorical journeys and the symbols of eternal recurrence, you cannot fail to be impressed by the man's vision and passion for Life and Truth.<br />While briefly flying through the equivalents of Halloween in different cultures, Bradbury also subtly honours the millions who were slaughtered under the tyranny of the Old Church during the Inquisition. As he clearly shows, our only real enemy is bigotry and superstition.<br />This wonderful book can be a learning experience for adults and children alike and is certainly one of RB's most original and exciting pieces. A modern classic.	2002-06-16

Clan is one of those rare books that breaks through the Esoterica Barrier and humanizes the practice of working with the Earth Mother and the Life-force itself.<br />It is an especially important book because it creates the impression that Wicca in all its forms makes total sense and that the natural magic Brondwin refers to in her Woman-orientated rituals is the birthright of every female on this planet. For too many centuries women above all, have feared even the idea of spells and incantations because of the legacy of the Inquisition, which Penny Shuttle and Peter Redgrove (The Wise Wound) referred to as &quot;Nine million menstrual murders&quot;.<br />Just reading Brondwin's book, you cannot help but realize that the suppression of the Feminine is nothing less than the suppression of the Life-force itself. After all, we are living in a patriarchal society that changed Menopause from a sacred transition into a form of mental illness. Well, they have to inhibit the Wisewoman somehow, don't they?<br />The irony is that man bashers like Andrea Dworkin and Mary Daly have made it harder for progressive feminists like Barbara G. Walker, June Singer, Jean Shinoda Bolen and C.C. Brondwin to write about Women's Issues. The problem being that over-sensitive males often see Pro-Female as being a form of Anti-Male, which it is NOT.<br />Apart from her erudition, which gives the book its credibility, Brondwin also throws in lashings of sass and humour, and many modern examples to illustrate her points - references to Riverdance and Loreena McKennitt, for example. If you're a guy reading this, buy it for a woman you love, whether it's your wife, girlfriend, mother, sister or whoever. If you're a woman, just buy it.<br />Whether you are looking for spiritual development or Love spells, this book has it all. Brondwin is not an armchair academic pagan. This Wisewoman walks the walk. I can only urge as many women as possible to join her. I have four daughters, and I shall certainly be urging them, too.<br />Steven Cain (author of Sirius Moonlight: The Origins Of The Suppression Of The Feminine).	2002-04-26

As many people have given excellent insights into the content of Was, I will just mention my own interpretation of this utter classic.<br />For me, the book (and even the Baum original) exists on many levels. Whereas Oz may be seen as a quantum pocket within the linear story track, it is the human experiences and the very nature of consciousness and identity that really drives the entire concept. <br />Yet the search for Dorothy's home is as much a bitter-sweet futility as the search for the Holy Grail, and merely takes you deeper into the Illusion and farther away from your true Self.<br />This multi character odyssey brings in many profound insights from various classic areas - from Dante's Inferno, the concept that the way to Heaven is through the deepest pit of Hell - from Zen, the concept that there is no Truth that exists outside of you, or as Alan Watts put it, \\"This is it\\" - and from the Baghavad Gita, the final realization that the warrior Arjuna learns from Krishna, that there is no mutant enemy, except ourselves.<br />As the song Tin Man by America suggests, The Wizard of Oz never gave anything to the Tin Man that he didn't already have.<br />Was and WOZ are both about the concept of Home, of belonging. Like Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, they are about Return. The return to the Cosmic Womb of the Great Mother.<br />I believe what Geoff Ryman is trying to tell us is that when you have finally found yourself, Oz is Kansas.	2002-04-10

I don't have a problem with basic Conspiracy Theory, in that the idea of The World Banking System ruling the planet makes sense. I can accept the Kennedy Conspiracy, Roswell, you name it, but like most people I find David's theories about all of the world's rulers being Reptilian shape-shifting Aliens a little hard to swallow. Especially when they are supposedly involved in the mass ritual sacrifice of children.<br />I presume the way he avoids massive law suits for defamation is by claiming to be reflecting the views of people such as 'former mind control slave' Arizona Wilder, and by pleading Truth as a defence, insisting that the Royal Family, George Bush etc. must prove that they are not Aliens. Yet the way Conspiracy theorists work, no proof would ever be enough anyway. If the rulers did submit to DNA testing and were found to be wholly human, ole Dave would no doubt insist that the tests were rigged.<br />Don't get me wrong, I can accept that the human race are a bunch of genetically engineered worker animals. Apart from the checked shirts, the booze, the smokes and the hockey, their willingness to accept injustice seems to be limitless. For example, nobody ever questioned the fact that a kid could be sent to Vietnam when he was 18, but couldn't by himself a drink until he was 21. Der...<br />If there is a flaw in David's voluminous research, it is that he tries to shoehorn everything into a preset framework, intending that it should prove his point, come what may. He takes all historical references to be literal, rather than symbolic or metaphorical, such as the many ancient serpent references, which he ties in with the Reptilian lineage. To most people serpent imagery represents symbols of cthonic (underworld) transcendence, and in the case of the serpent eating its own tail, regeneration and eternal recurrence.<br />If one got into a Conspiracy and Disinformation mindset, one could even question Dave himself. If you look at the effects that his work has onpeople, it can be quite damaging, by crushing their belief systems, by telling them that everything they ever believed was a lie, and by telling them that an unimaginably brutal and all encompassing Conspiracy, presided over by an all powerful Alien race has complete control of this planet, and has from day one.<br />While he includes a relative throwaway acknowledgement that all beings are from the same life force, and that people should just do their own work and disconnect from the system as much as they can, his main focus is on the unimaginable horror of the human zoo.<br />Icke's information about the Reptilians seems to come primarily from the testimony of individuals such as Arizona Wilder, who having somehow shaken off her mind control programming, can now \\"remember\\" seeing the British Royal Family as Reptilian shape shifters, who regularly indulge in the ritual murder of children. Yes, it could be true. Then again, these could be the fantasies of a disturbed individual, or somebody who just didn't get enough attention as a child, or somebody who is deliberately spreading disinformation in the hope that David Icke would lap it up and build entire books around the myth, and thereby lose the credibility that he was beginning to amass, prior to him going off the deep end.<br />Anybody can claim to remember cosmic things. I could claim to have been an Alien military intelligence officer with the Templar garrison at Acre, but I could no more prove this than Wilder can prove one scrap of the genocidal shape shifter information that Icke so readily portrays as fact. <br />Three stars for sheer audacity. Buy it soon, because if the Government ever tightens the defamation laws, David Icke will be in a sling.<br />One final thought... If David Icke is right and his revelations are so revolutionary and devastating to the Power Elite, why is he still alive? Too high profile to be a target? JFK was as high profile as it gets. No, David Icke is being allowed to continue.Surely even a human could see that.	2002-04-08

This is still my favourite of all Pamela's books and a true Rock Culture classic. Anybody who was Frank Zappa's nanny and Jimmy Page's girlfriend in the same lifetime has to be worth reading - and this gal can write.<br />Unlike some books, this is in no way a name-dropping cash-in. Pamela actually did all these things, was all these things. She WAS Don Johnson's girlfriend, and buds with a young Vince Furnier (Alice Cooper), Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Moon etc. with an awesome collection of photos to prove it.<br />Written with the wisdom and humility that only comes with the approach of middle age, (when, in my opinion, women are just beginning to enter their prime), IWTB is a very human look under the hood of the Rock Machine. There are so many delicious insights into the whole Led Zeppelin era, that by the time you have devoured the book, you feel like you had actually been there. <br />Unfortunately IWTB is presently out of print, but her ElectricGypsy website may have some information about future availability.

I am not in any way exaggerating when I say that I had an out-of-body experience upon finishing The End Of All Songs (Book 3) - such is the level of transcendence that this epic work generates.<br />The implications of Dancers are so vast and numerous that it makes your head spin, but even as a fairly linear allegory, it is right on the button. The main characters live in a far future world, where the level of technology borders on magic, allowing them to create virtually any reality with their power rings. <br />Yet the technology is the product of earlier generations, of whom the remaining race are mostly unaware - recalling Prospero's line to Miranda (from The Tempest) &quot;Canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell?&quot; Big Mike likens these artificially sustained beings to a collection of hothouse flowers, which are kept alive by &quot;an alien heat&quot; (Wratislaw?)<br />The parallels with Earth Now and the direction in which post Industrial Revolution humanity has been heading are chilling, however humorously expressed. High entropy, energy-wasting civilizations have become so disconnected from the Earth Mother that it may only be a matter of time before some T2-style AI-triggered GigaDeath apocalypse sweeps the board clean.<br />In his Moorcockian epic Finnegans Wake,  James Joyce used paradoxically structured anarchic language in an attempt to overload the reader's dominant Left Brain and trigger Transcendence. Moorcock manages to achieve the same Above Time perspective by infinitely more conventional means, yet the effect is the same. Union. Oneness. Return.<br />If this breathtakingly beautiful classic doesn't blow your mind, check your pulse... maybe you're already dead.<br />Utterly majestic.	2002-02-03

In terms of quantum reality theory and cyborg anthropology, The Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix.<br />While one could break the book down into a basic linear story, which weaves and meanders through the seven-stage structure, like a river, the reductionism or deconstruction approach is itself vulnerable.<br />While there are many serious threads, FW is also a minefield of literary and linguistic-phonentic puns. I once read a review in which the writer dismissed the word \\"upfellbown\\" as one of Joyce's many nonsense words. Nope. Upfellbown is a phonetic portrayal of the German word apfelbaum, or apple tree, which Joyce had mentioned slightly earlier in the text. Where people often go off the deep end is in attributing undue significance to these individual words.<br />If The Wake is about anything, it is about phenomenology or holism versus reductionism. The significance of the whole versus the sum of the parts. You don't understand The Wake, you experience it. On a vastly simpler level, the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys brilliantly captures the beauty of the recursive temporal symmetry that underlies Joyce's re-entrant epic.<br />For those who have never read FW, it is basically about an Irish bricklayer called Tim Finnegan (Finnegans Wake being a traditional song, of sorts) who falls, probably drunkenly, from a ladder. The 'story' that follows is either his Death Dream or Near Death Experience, in which the entireity of Earth's history cycles through his mind. (There has even been debate about the identity of the Dreamer.) Symbolically, Finnegan's fall from the ladder could be representative of the Fall of Lucifer or the Fall of man.<br />The Wake means whatever it means to the individual reader at that point in his or her lifetime. For me, the many references to the Triple Goddess and Masonic ritual leaped out of the text. Yet had I not read so much about these things, the references would mean nothing. Yet, I have probably missed thousands of things that others will see.<br />Quick example... The three main female characters, Kate, Issy (Isis) and ALP form the principle references to the presence of the Great Mother/The Triple Goddess. Both Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are about return. The return to the cosmic womb of the Great Mother. The beginning and the end of Time.<br />Issy is Isis, who is in herself the Mother Goddess. Issy's room is blue with a ceiling of stars - \\"the twinkly way\\". A classic feature of the ceilings of Masonic lodges. Sirius, the Star of Isis is the Blazing Star of freemasonry, whose square and compass logo can be extended out to form a pentagram, depicting the four elements, plus the fifth element - the Creatrix. The third degree ceremony of freemasonry is a symbolic death and rebirth, symbolized by the skull and crossbones - the sign of Osiris risen. The Wake, which itself is about rebirth and resurrection - Finnegan = Finn Again, has many esoteric references, and even obvious ones, such as PHOENIX Park, and the fact that the book is set on March 21st, the Spring or Vernal Equinox - the beginning of the pagan New Year.<br />Aw hell, I'm rambling. That's the trouble with The Wake. It sucks you in. Give it a shot, but don't try to understand it from the outset. Try to just read it all the way through first and then maybe do some dissection. Whereas Ulysses is 24 hours out of Bloom's life, allegorically interwoven with the Ulysses myth (instead of returning to Ithaca, he returns to Number Seven Eccles Street), FW is just too massive to see a linear series of exact correspondences. There's also a great deal of literary chaff. The man had a sense of humour, after all.<br />The bottom line for me, is that The Wake is about the transforming power of the Feminine - like Mary Poppins, like Chocolat, like A Midsummer Night's Dream, like Alice In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass, like Cities Of The Red Night...<br />Here Comes Everything...ike Cities Of The Red Night...<br />Here Comes Everything...	2002-01-20

Power in Wagner's Ring Cycle and in Us- A Jungian-Feminist Perspective (Jung on the Hudson Book Series)	Books	5	12	18	N	N	Cold Wind To Valhalla	Certainly one of Bolen's most essential works. Ring Of Power provides a valuable guide to Wagner's classic Ring Cycle, yet it is Bolen's grasp of the archetypal basis for the mythology that gives the book its power.<br />All creation comes from an archetypal base, and in The Ring, it is the symbolic sacrificing of the Sacred Feminine that drives the entire story. This principle is fundamental to many pieces, including Faust, the Grail legends and even Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. <br />In each case, only the restoration of that which has been sacrificed in a Faustian pact can make healing occur. Bolen's genius is never clearer than in this book, and it was pivotal to the concluding sections of my own book, Sirius Moonlight: The Origins Of The Suppression Of The Feminine.<br />I would strongly recommend Ring Of Power, and indeed all of Bolen's works - especially her autobiographical Crossing To Avalon. People who doubt the importance of Thinking Person's Feminism might consider this... 84 years ago Jean Shinoda Bolen would not have been able to vote, own her own house or inherit property from her father. Like every other woman in the highly civilized English-speaking world.<br />My own book is dedicated to the nine million women who were murdered by the Church during the Inquisition, for such heinous crimes as being midwives and healers. Lest we forget. If the patriarchal Valhalla is now burning, all I can say is pass the gasoline. Good job, Jean.	2001-11-13

The story uses a mermaid metaphor to unfold this tale of transition and mutual transformation. (The story is even based in Copenhagen, with its famous mermaid statue.) As in all mermaid folklore, the siren-like Karin has to sacrifice something precious in order to enter the world of her mortal lover. This hinted-at infanticide which has parallels in Goethe's Faust, is one of the main Gothic splinters that drives the horror level of the story. Karin is truly an enigmatic character, being simultaneously The Goddess Incarnate and a star-crossed mermaid who craves the transition into mortal womanhood, like a darker version of Ibsen's Lady From The Sea. However tragic the relationship may appear, the underlying theme of the transforming power of the Feminine (which even appears in Chocolat and Mary Poppins) lifts the novel onto another level. Just as Faust is saved by the love of a servant girl who has been driven to madness and infanticide by the patriarchal arhitecture of misogyny, so too the male protagonist in TGIAS surrenders to the Chaos of Being, retaining one foot firmly in the Otherworld. If guilt and alienation turn your crank, this is for you. Happy ever after? That depends on what and who you are and where you have come from.	2001-09-08

Walker. Of all the sources that I quoted from my bibliography, Walker was by far the most significant. The Woman's Encyclopedia is the most valuable book in my collection, and it represents a superhuman piece of research. The suppression of the Feminine and the patriarchal re-writing of history can be traced through innumerable references - from Christianity's assimilation of pagan rituals and festivals to the creation of the mythology of feminine evil. Walker, like Jungian analyst June Singer, believes that patriarchal religion is the basis for the suppression of women. The case she builds is frankly unassailable. After reading this classic study, one cannot fail to see the transforming power of the Mother Goddess in everything from A Midsummer Night's Dream and Finnegans Wake to Mary Poppins and The Matrix. Barbara Walker is a modern-day Wisewoman, and we can never have enough of those. In a sterile, left-brain, hunter-killer psytocracy, Walker's books shine like a beacon for those who still have the strength to dream.<br />Steven Cain (Author of Sirius Moonlight: The Origins Of The Suppression Of The Feminine.)	2000-12-23
