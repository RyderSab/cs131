This book is a wonderful compilation of small essay's written by a commentator concerning life and living in the South. It's small, each essay takes only a minute or two to read, and its a joy to read. Take a little bit of Southern Comfort from this book as it will warm your heart and lighten your heart. Highly recommended.	2005-08-11

This book will present you with many puzzles and some explanation that will improve your ability to see the board and the moves on it, but it is not complete by itself, you'll need another book that will help you bone up on the ideas behind positions and help you to think through tactics and strategy in a more abstract way. Get this book and Chess for Dummies or The Mammoth Book of Chess for a great 1-2 punch for starting to play seriously.	2003-07-14

I haven't even been trying incrediably hard (though I'm now motivated to try much harder) and yet I've already learned techniques to solve puzzles and other things that I used to dread. A couple of notes: this book is good BUT you will get 1000% more out of it if you do the follow extra work.<BR>A) Buy, read, re-read, and do the exercises in Learning How to Draw on the Right Side of the Brain. Image Streaming and Non-Verbal right sided thinking are almost the same thing. This book helps a lot!<BR>B) Learn how to meditate. You don't have to become a guru just practice it a little bit. Image Streaming is mediation.<BR>C) Learn a little bit about self-hypnosis. Just enough to put yourself in a trance should be enough so you'll know what it feels like and know how to get into that state without much effort.<BR>D) Listen to, love, and savor classical/instrumental music. George Winston, Bach, Mozart, you name it.<BR>I am an academic failure but because of this book and the other steps listed above I'm now going back to college to finish my undergrad degree and get a Ph.D in computation congnitive science. I've found that 99% of my &quot;academic&quot; troubles were based on negative thoughts and stuff that other people put in my head (ohh that (pick subject) is too hard, your smart but not that smart, etc.). 99.9% of your &quot;mental&quot; limitations are caused by this negative programming.

Its not for absolute beginners, you should have read at least one other book on beginners Chess (Chess for Dummies is a good one) but its not for &quot;intermediate&quot; players or advanced players only either. If you know enough of the basics (basic endgames, algebraic notation, etc), you will get a lot out of this book. I love the puzzles, they really make you think and it feels great to get a particularly hard one right. This book will make you a better chess player, if your just starting out (with the caveat above) or have been playing awhile. I would recommend this book for beginners and intermediate players. Advanced players might like this in their library, if only to loan out to friends that are trying to get up to speed. Buy it, at this price you won't be disappointed!	2003-07-11

I don't necessarily agree with everything Jim Murray writes but it did give me a lot of interesting ideas for new and different whiskey's to try. His descriptions of the various whiskey's and whiskey's making are enough to make your mouth water.	2003-07-11

Its an interesting concept and I enjoyed reading the book and trying out the excersises. I believe that there is some validity to the principals but I think you may need more then this little book provides to truly be able to use the system. Paul Scheele sells a whole bunch of more expensive sets of learning material from his website (of course) I haven't bought any yet but I'm very tempted to based on this book.	2003-07-11

I think this is probably because this is a very immature field within computer science. If your a researcher or a professor then you might have some use for this book, if your anyone else, stay away!	2003-07-11

Buy it used. <br />This book is used as a textbook in many computer science departments (hence the inflated price) but I found that even with the minimal computer science education I've had (mostly from self-study) I learned a lot and did not find this book overly difficult to follow.	2003-07-11

If you like Rush BigMouth then you'll love Neal Boortz, because Boortz actually knows something and has an IQ higher then 95.	2003-07-11

For the money its an excellent resource. I purchased it full price and found that it was somewhat useful in instituting security polices for the Web servers I was responsible for. You should also consider getting some of the Hacker expliotation books just to understand more of the mindset of how a Hacker attacks.	2003-07-11

I liked Dune and so far I'm liking Children of Dune better then Dune Messiah, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. It was a great book that bridges the stories in Dune and Children of Dune well. You have to read this book if you want to be well read in the classics of Science Fiction. Frank Herbert is an awesome writer and this was a very enjoyable tale. Its made more enjoyable by the fact that it is the prerequisite to reading Children of Dune, which is GREAT!	2003-07-11

If you just got thrown to the wolves though then this may (or may not help). I can't honestly recommend this book.	2003-07-11

I really enjoyed reading this book and taking a somewhat different look at how things are done today. I don't agree with everything in it, but at least its helped me see things in a different light.	2003-07-11

If you got this and The C Programming Language by Brian W.

Highly recommended!	2003-06-17

I haven't even been trying incrediably hard (though I'm now motivated to try much harder) and yet I've already learned techniques to solve puzzles and other things that I used to dread. A couple of notes: this book is good BUT you will get 1000% more out of it if you do the follow extra work.<BR>A) Buy, read, re-read, and do the exercises in Learning How to Draw on the Right Side of the Brain. Image Streaming and Non-Verbal right sided thinking are almost the same thing. This book helps a lot!<BR>B) Learn how to meditate. You don't have to become a guru just practice it a little bit. Image Streaming is mediation.<BR>C) Learn a little bit about self-hypnosis. Just enough to put yourself in a trance should be enough so you'll know what it feels like and know how to get into that state without much effort.<BR>D) Listen to, love, and savor classical/instrumental music. George Winston, Bach, Mozart, you name it.<br />I am an academic failure but because of this book and the other steps listed above I'm now going back to college to finish my undergrad degree and get a Ph.D in computation congnitive science. I've found that 99% of my &quot;academic&quot; troubles were based on negative thoughts and stuff that other people put in my head (ohh that (pick subject) is too hard, your smart but not that smart, etc.). 99.9% of your &quot;mental&quot; limitations are caused by this negative programming. Get rid of it and (assuming you don't suffer from physical brain damage) you will be able to join Mensa. I know, I went from having an IQ of 115 to having one high enough to (at least attempt) the Mensa IQ test. That's a jump of 15 points in a little over a month and its only just started.	2001-11-26
