US	47513432	R2DP5506XR3DU6	0439531640	208757740	Inkheart	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A Wonderful Read	Cornelia Funke, the German children's author behind the breakout hit \\"The Thief Lord\\", gives bibliophiles their due in \\"Inkheart\\", a 500+ fantasy novel that will make you take notice of Funke's incredible story-telling skills. <br /> <br />The novel is about 12 year-old Meggie who lives with her father Moe, a book binder by trade. Now, being the daughter of a book binder means your gonna grow up loving books, and boy are we right! Meggie and Moe are avid readers who find nothing better to do on a rainy day than to curl up in a comfy chair and read. One night, a strange man calling himself Dustfinger appears at Moe's home. He warns Moe that another man named Capricorn is after him. Moe takes flight with Meggie to visit her aunt in the country side, but Dustfinger is right behind them. Soon, Meggie learns that Moe has the power to read characters stright out of their books and goes on an adventures unlike anyone has ever read. <br /> <br />Now, this is my first time reading anything Funke has wriiten. I have heard passing praises about her work and I finally decided to take a chance with \\"Inkheart\\", since the plot and characters appealed to my tastes in books. Now I can say that the praises are indeed correct: Funke is magnificent! Her ability to weave stories is amazing! The characters are all fleshed out and are fully developed. They bring the story to life (no pun intended)! Funke also pays close attention to detail and creates fully believable enviroments that make you want to turn the page! <br /> <br />The only downside to \\"Inkheart\\" is that it takes a good chunk of the book to really get into the story, mostly in the beginning. While the first several chapters are important for developing the core and appeal of the novel, overall, I found these sections slow and dragging. But once Capricorn gets ahold of Moe, the pace immediately picked up and made the rest of the novel a pleasure to read! I also found the quotes from other novels to be irritating sometimes, since they where there as \\"enhancers\\" for each chapter. I wanted to skip over most of them, since I was eager to continue. But, the quotes also have \\"Inkheart\\" a nice, interesting feature no other children's novel has. <br /> <br />Now with the upcoming release of \\"Inkspell\\", the sequel to \\"Inkheart\\", and a film adaption of \\"Inkheart\\" in the works, I can't wait for Funke to continue with this series (she is planning a third book as well)!	2005-06-21

For those who haven't, here's the lowdown: A group of five girls fight crime using their animal powers that where given to them via an experiment gone wrong. Now the girls must fight an alien race that wants to take back the Earth via polluting it even worse then we have and fighting off the race's minons as well. <br /> <br />While the first volume left me almost regreting picking up this series and the second volume made me taking the pervious statement back, I eargerly dove right into volume three. Now the story finally picks up the pace and gives the read all the reason to continue the series! <br /> <br />In this volume, the girls are on a quest to discover the Mew Aqua, a powerful element that can purify anything contaminated. While it maybe all work and no play, the group finally gets some downtime by going on a cruise that Ryou, the girls' mentor/boss, is holding. But trouble is never far away as Kish, leader of the alien race, crashes the party. Meanwhile, Ichigo continues her troubles with Masaya, her crush. Does he know about her secret identity or not? <br /> <br />What I enjoied the most from this volume is that it has given the chance to start flushing out the secondary characters. We get a chance to see shy Lettuce come over her cowardliness and we finally get to see the motivation behind Kish and his compainons' plot to take over Earth. These events helped the story finally take it's shape and made me want to keep reading. The art, as always, is udderly cute and adorable (thus so, you may have a craving for sweets after reading this series). I also liked how the romance between Ichigo and Masaya has improved. No longer is it forced nor cheesy, but it is starting to become interesting. I was starting to enjoy the interludes of the Ichigo and Masaya scenes, hoping that everything works out all right. <br /> <br />As for the negative aspects of this volume, my only complaint is the repetitive dialodge. How many times can you say \\"that's cool!\\" or a variation of it? It's as if Paris Hilton was the story editor! <br /> <br />Anyway, if you are a fan of \\"Mew Mew Power\\", the animated version of this series airing on the FoxBox, do yourself a favor and start reading the manga! It contains everything you love about the series, but it is played out much, much, much better! Tokyo Mew Mew is also a great series to get into if your a fan of Sailor Moon, Pretear, or any other shojo series.	2005-06-21
US	47513432	R283SVMKPTBQ0N	159182236X	720091189	Mew Mew to the Rescue (Tokyo Mew-Mew, Vol.1)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	It Hits 11 on the Cuteness Scale of 1-10	I came across Tokyo Mew Mew via the FoxBox's airing of the horrid English version of this title called \\"Mew Mew Power\\". As I have said in my review of Shaman King, the main reason why it's so horribly dubbed and edited is because of the target audience (kids and tweens). Still, I was hoping that I would grow to like the series as I did with Shaman King. <br /> <br />Well, let me just say on thing: The cuteness level is dangerously high! Just like the amps in Spinal Tap, Tokyo Mew Mew hits \\"11\\" instead of your standerd \\"10\\". It's right up there with Hello Kitty and Miffy, so if your a sucker for cute creatures and of the like, you'll love this series!  <br /> <br />With that said and done, the plot deals 11 year old Ichigo Momomiya, who is on a date with her crush Masaya at a museum showcasing endangered species. While there, she and four other girls all somehow get injected with the DNA of five endangered animals. Now possessing the animal DNA, Ichigo can transform into the magical girl Mew Mew and fight off aliens that are bent on taking over the Earth. <br /> <br />While the plot for every magical girl manga/anime pretty much stays the same (causing many to shout \\"Sailor Moon rip-off!\\"), the idea of the heroine being injected with animal DNA is a nice touch. Seeing Ichigo, Mint and Lettuce struggle with their new powers makes this volume worth reading. I also enjoied the art throughout the book. Mia Ikumi knows how to milk those cuteness levels! I especially love her Super Deformed cast dressed up like cows near the end of the book; they make me grin from ear to ear! <br /> <br />But with it's good points, Tokyo Mew Mew does have it's downsides. For one, the Ichigo and Masaya romance felt like it was forced into the story line. I also found some of the info behind Ichigo's transformation a little cheesy (the UMA reference is one example). Still, this is a magcial girl series afterall, so all is forgiven. <br /> <br />Now the big question: Have I now become a fan of Tokyo Mew Mew? I can't really say right now, but I can give a more justified answer once I have read the entire series (a total of seven volumes). But from what I have read, it's much better than the anime. Hopefully, future volumes get better as well. So, if you want a magical girl series to tie you over while your saving your money for your next Sailor Moon DVD, Tokyo Mew Mew is the one to go to.	2005-06-09

I must say it is now an improvement over the lack luster first volume, since we now get to see the whole team together and in action. <br /> <br />Here's a quick recap: Ichigo and her friends Mint, Lettuce, Pudding, and Zakuro where all injected with the DNA of five endangered species by freak accident. Thus, the girls gain super-human abilities and have all banded together to form Tokyo Mew Mew, a team that works at Cafe Mew Mew by day and fighting nasty aliens at night. <br /> <br />In volume two, we get to see the characters expand on their personalities and see more in depth coverage on the Ichigo and Masaya romance. We are also intoduced to the alien race via a character named Kish, who just happens to enjoy flirting with Ichigo and being a general pest. We now get a better picture on what our enemy looks and acts like. <br /> <br />Once again, the cuteness level is high, so be prepared! My opinons have taken a much more positive approch, since the story now has more meat and less filler. My only grip is a scene inwhich Masaya tells Ichigo to wear a cat bell because she is his \\"all-time favorite kitty\\". It's so cheesy, but then again, all magical girl series are little cheesy at some point.  <br /> <br />I honestly can't wait to read the rest of this series. Now that the team is formed, I can't wait to see how the girls will defeat their enemy and to see how much their personalities develop. So, if you've seen the anime, I highly suggest read the manga. It will make the experience much more rewarding.	2005-06-09
US	47513432	RSH9OCGQROEEX	0152052216	139938581	East	Books	5	10	13	N	N	A Page-Turner!	East is one of many books targeted toward teens that reimagines a well-known fairy tale that can either make or brake. While many authors tend to stray away from the material, East has done an excellent job of recreating the Norwegian tale \\"East to the Sun, West of the Moon\\" and creating a worthy fantasy novel that anyone can deeply enjoy. <br /> <br />The novel tells the tale of a young teen named Rose who is the youngest child of a farming couple. Her mother is extremely superstitious, sighting that all of her children must be born within the compass range (she believes that the points of a compass determain the personalities of her family). When she gives birth to Rose, she is shocked to discover that her daughter is a \\"North\\" born (North children are restless and explorers by nature). Fearing that her daughter will die a premature death, Rose's mother sites that her daughter is an \\"East\\" born and attempts to raise her as a quiet, patient girl. <br /> <br />But when a white bear arrives at the family farm years later (admit a string of unforunate events, including a seriously ill family member), he requests that Rose must travel with him to his castle. After arguing with her mother and father, Rose decides to take the bear's offer and goes to his castle, where she discovers a terrible secret about the bear and ultimately begins her journey of self-discovery and purpose. <br /> <br />East is told in a varity of voices, including Rose herself and of the white bear. Many pervious reviewers have complained that this makes the overall pace of the book choppy. I disagree. The various narrators is what gives the novel it's character. It makes the whole reading experience rewarding and provides a wide-range scope on the events that lead up to the ending (which, as many before me have stated, is predicable). Plus, each narrator is very descriptive of thier enviroments and makes the reader engaged in the material. You want to keep reading on what will happen next to Rose and the other characters! <br /> <br />I cannot find anything wrong with this novel (except for the ending, but this is a fairy tale after all; every fairy tale traditonally has a happy ending). If you want a novel that will keep you enterained through a long winter (or a boring summer vacation), East is the book for you!	2005-05-20

Let's say your 14 years old and have always wanted to fly away from your problems. What would you do? Where would you go? Who would be there along for the journey? Well, if your 14 year old Max (aka Maximum) Ride, be sure to buckle up; it's gonna be a very bumpy ride.<br /><br />In the novel, Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment, we are introduced to Max and her compainions Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman and Angel (known has The Flock). They are a group of young children who where born and raised in a genetics lab call the School, where they where given avian DNA at the time of their birth. Thus, The Flock is only 98% human and 2% bird, leaving them with wings and other mutant abnormalities. The novel fast forwards you to when The Flock are living a care-free life (the person who rescued them, Jeb, has disappeared two years ago) in the mountains. Suddenly, a group of other mutants from the School called Erasers (who are part human, part wolf), rain on their parade and kidnap Angel. Max and the other children then are off in a frantic search and rescue mission, as well as other surprises that might test young heroes.<br /><br />James Patterson, who is famous for the Alex Cross series, has managed to create a delightful spin-off from the characters that where mentioned in his two pervious books, When the Wind Blows and The Lake House. Granted, I have not read any other of Patterson's books until now, but I have become a fan! Patterson's characters are fresh and engaging, making you want to continue to read and explore the novel. Max is a much needed change of the teenage herione. Max doesn't have to worry about boys, the school dance, or being popular. She has much more complex issues to deal with (such has the constant reminder that she is destined to save the world; among other things).<br /><br />I also enjoied how Patterson manages to keep the action going. Once The Flock has entered a new surrounding, it makes you want to discover how they will adapt to it. Weather its gallvanting on a beach or just going into a toy store, Patterson makes sure that his charcters have an interesting time and always discover something new about themselves in the process.<br /><br />However, I have found (and have quickly noticed), that Patterson often has extremely short chapters (there's even a chapter that has a total of one page!). To me, this is a bit fustrating. Just has you get into one section, Patterson immedeatly drops you into another one; almost identical as the last! Still, this strategy works, as it enages the reader and makes you want to continue reading the book until the last page. Also, the whole book seems underdeveloped. You get basic discriptions of places and characters, but it would help if Patterson spent a little more time on developing these attributes instead of writting short, pointless chapters.<br /><br />But still, Patterson has created a great story that he will be continuing in the near future (it has been reported that the sequel will be coming out in 2006). If you are looking for a teen novel that doesn't use all of the typical cliques of the teen genra, then Maximum Ride is the perfect book for you!ather its gallvanting on a beach or just going into a toy store, Patterson makes sure that his charcters have an interesting time and always discover something new about themselves in the process. <br /> <br />However, I have found (and have quickly noticed), that Patterson often has extremely short chapters (there's even a chapter that has a total of one page!).

Reality Check comes from Rikki and Tavisha Simons, the creative team behind their latest series Shutterbox. While Shutterbox is a Goth Romance series, Reality Check is a much more light and cheerful comic. In volume 1, we are introduced to 10th grader Collen Meeks, a geek who longs to access the Virtual Internet System (VIS) in the year 2012. After receiving his True Virtual Reality Helmet (TVR), Collen finally manages to access the VIS...until his cat Catreece also logs on as well. In Real Time, Catreece is a small, cute, annoying cat...on the VIS, she's like the annoying sibling you wish you didn't have! Thus, all sorts of crazy adventures (and misadventures) occur for our computer nerd and his bubbly, ditzy cat. <br /> <br />One thing that stands out when you dive into Reality Check is the wonderful art. Orginally, RC was published in color (the color edition has long been out of print, but you can still find new/used copies at certain stores). TokyoPop has decided to publish RC in their standered B&W format, but it still doesn't take away the amazing detail that Tavisha has done! All the characters (major and minor), backgrounds, ect. are full of life and personality. You can help turning the page to see what they are up to next!  <br /> <br />I also like the story that the Simons have written. It creates a fun enviroment that possible might happen in the next several years. The story line never lets you down! It makes you keep on reading to find out how Collen and Catreece will get out of thier scraps on the VIS. Also, all the characters don't have 2D personality, so they are easily likeable and charming! <br /> <br />Plus, as an added bonus, this volume includes are nice gallery of the Simons concept art for the RC series, a treat for fans and newbies alike! <br /> <br />So if you enjoied Shutterbox, give Reality Check a try...it's just a fascinating and great as SB. For anyone wanting to see what American-based manga is all about, the Simons are the perfect team to go to!	2005-03-15
US	47513432	R3TWBSNLKNIZ6H	0974029092	492528729	1: Silverlance	Books	3	1	1	N	N	An Interesting Fantasy Tale	As a fan of sci-fi/fantasy novels, when I was presented a chance to review Silverlance (the author requested me to write up a review), I jumped at the chance and I am here now with my two cents on this new series for children. <br /> <br />The novel is about a young satyr named Byron who is celebrating his 12th birthday by holding a Mirule's Day (think along the lines of April Fools). While this is suppose to be a day of celebration, an uneasy force is cast over the Woody Deep (Byron's home) and signals a quest the young satyr must embark on. He must discover the whereabouts of a famed satyr named Silverlance and test his own strengths and skills along the way. <br /> <br />One of the most interesting characteristics that this novel showcases is it's cast of mythical creatures. While satyrs and centaurs are often stuck in the role of the hero's sidekick or comic relief, it was a nice change to see these creatures take center stage. I found it interesting that the author (Peter Thomas Crowell) self-published it, which is a hard task in itself to do. <br /> <br />However, the reading level was too juvenile for my taste. Most of the sentence structure was simplistic and made the story fast-paced, often leaving no room for accurate descriptions of the lands that reside in Silverlance. We are only given the tip of the iceberg; the basic outline of the villages, mountain ranges, ect. Another problem I found was the portrayal of the characters. All where 2-D and pretty much shared the same emotion or stance throughout the novel; despite when he/she was sad, angry, worried, ect. Thus, no real connection or feelings was made between the reader and the characters.  <br /> <br />I also disliked how the formula for meeting new charcters was presented. It pretty much went like this: The cast enters a new land/village/area, meets it's inhabiters, one of the inhabiters decides to join the group (often with little or no explaination), group leaves land/village/area with new member.This formula is repeated so often, the story itself contains no \\"meat\\", only \\"filler\\". <br /> <br />But, despite it's flaws, Silverlance is a great book for kids in grades 4-6 and perhaps even middle school-aged children would enjoy such an interesting tale. If you want your children to dive into a good fantasy novel, then Silverlance is right up your ally. And, if you are wondering about the characters, the author is planning a series of Byron and his friends (as of right now, he is currently working on the second book). I personally am not interested in continuing this series (unless Book 2 appeals to me), but perhaps those who enjoy Silverlance will.	2004-10-28
US	47513432	R1A25GJ3ESBMPK	0385730721	278667968	Snakecharm: The Kiesha'ra: Volume Two	Books	3	10	13	N	N	The Shapeshifters Return	Amelia Atwater-Rhodes welcomes us back into her world of shapeshifters in this second volume of the planned Kiesha'Ra series. First off, if you haven't read Hawksong (the first volume), you will be lost in the second volume. While there are brief references to that book in this novel, Snakecharm introduces us to a new clan and characters, but also lacks the power of it's predecessor. <br /> <br />In Snakecharm, Zane takes the driver's wheel and guides us into the newlywed's life with his pair bond Danica. Both the lands of the hawks and the snakes are at peace (with a few bumps), but this is all put on a string when Syfka, a powerful falcon from Ahnmik (home of her people), warns Zane and Danica of a wanted falcon is in their land. And to make matters worse, Danica is pregnant with their first child, which could upset the balance of the hawks and the snakes. <br /> <br />The plot offers a more gripping, mature and dark tone than Hawksong. To me, it offers a more reality-based peice than Atwater-Rhodes last offering (Hawksong was Romeo and Juliet without the climatic death of the main characters). Also, it's nice to see old characters return and with a whole new outlook on their ever-changing world. Zane's first-person narrative offers a new face too, but it seems Atwater-Rhodes needs some more experience writting for a main male character. While she has proven great success with her main female characters, Zane's P.O.V. is often crossing the line between first/third person and this tends to leave the reader wandering around with no guidence.  <br /> <br />Along with her weak male narrator, Atwater-Rhodes also treads into familar problems once more. She offers her readers a fantasical world, but she only gives you the tip of the iceberg. Some areas could use vast improvement, but mostly this makes the novel fast-paced, leaving no time for the reader to take nessarry information in. Another problem she also presents is the odd arrangement of characters. Atwater-Rhodesoften adds characters \\"for the sake of addition characters\\", meaning compact and over-stuffed scenes.  <br /> <br />Speaking of characters, I find the use of Normal and RPG-Style names within the same setting quite annoying. This makes the story not really believeible. If Atwater-Rhodes is desperately trying to create a fantasy setting, adding names like \\"Besty\\" makes me think that she isn't trying. One other complaint I offer is the issue of quickie romances. The budding romance between Kel and Rei is sloppily added in out of the blue. This, along with the trademark forced ending, is poorly done. Speaking of Rei, that name is Japanese and it is (I believe) a female name. To me, this name doesn't suit her male character very well (if you want to name a seemingly-weak male character, try Pip).  <br /> <br />All in all, Snakecharm is an OK follow-up to Hawksong. I will still continue to read the rest of Atwater-Rhodes' series. The idea of the supposed encounter with the wolf shapeshifters and a new court is very promising, along with the birth of Zane and Danica's child. In adding my two cents to the ever-growing complaint about the new size and price of Snakecharm, I like the larger format. It makes reading the book easier, but I don't agree that $14.95 should be the publisher's recommended price. If the book was much longer (the total number of pages for Snakecharm is 167), then this price would suit just fine. Amazon's price (or if you have a discount at a bookstore), is much more fitting.	2004-10-19

After falling in love with the first book, I immedeately pre-ordered the second volume of this wonderful series. Now, after I read this volume, I can't wait to revisit Clive Barker's amazing Abarat! <br /> <br />Picking up right where the first book left off, our heroine Candy continues her journey in Abarat and in her journey of self-discovery. After finding out that she has been to Abarat before in Book One, this volume reveals to the reader (and to Candy) the answer she has been seeking and introduces us to the begining of the war between the forces of Night and Day. Along the way, we are introduced to several new characters, including the famed Dragon slayer Finnigan Hob and Letheo the beast-boy.  <br /> <br />Once again, Barker's colorful and lively paintings take center stage. This is no truer than in several chapters that deal with Candy and Malingo as they explore the island of Babilonium (aka The Carnival Island). Taking a cue from such fantasies as Little Nemo in Slumberland and Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials triology, Barker creates paintings that showcase his description about the island, from a gallery of freaks to the crowds of people from just about every corner of the Abarat! This is my favorite part of book; it makes me want to explore the world Barker has created for myself and take in all the sites, sounds, and smells! <br /> <br />Once again, if you have not read the Abarat series, what are you waiting for? If you love fantasy series that are orginal and descriptive like The Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, or His Dark Materials, then read this series! Once you've been to Abarat, you'll want to go back for more!	2004-10-12

I was always fascinated by her incredible black and while photographs of Edith and the Bears and how gentle thier poses where. Many years later, I read an excerpt about this book in an issue of Entertainment Weekly, which quickly rekindled my love for Wright's book and I immediately ran out and purchsed a copy. <br /> <br />Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Jean Nathan(the author), who visited Dare during her final days before her death, did an excellent job on her research about Dare and her family. While keeping a neutral position on some of the shocking revelations she encountered (such as a possible romance between Dare and her brother Blaine), Nathan has done an excellent job crafting a tale of pain, loss and lonliness that Dare had experienced throughout most of her life. By the time the reader reaches Dare's later years (which was during the deaths of her mother and Blaine), you are feeling sympathitic about Dare and can now understand the hidden messages throughout her books. <br /> <br />If you have been a fan of her work since you where a child (or have just become one after reading this), this book showcases all the good, the bad, and the ugly time that Dare has been through. And, after reading this, I have become even a bigger fan of Dare's work. Now, everytime I look are her photos, I can see how much she put her feelings into each and everyone.	2004-10-10

Wiether she wants to be an actress, rockstar, or even a manga-ka (Japanese comic book creator), she never fails to grab people's attention. With all the legal trouble she has under her belt lately, it seems that one would think with all those court dates and rehab appointments, that Love wouldn't be able to release her much-hyped manga, Princess Ai. But, low and behold, volume 1 is out now. <br />  <br /> Taking many elements from her colorful past, we are introduced to Love's alter-ego, a young girl named Ai. She is a princess from a place called Ai-Land. Having somehow traveled to Tokyo, Japan from Ai-Land, our tough, but naive, princess secures a job singing at a local club and begins her path on discovering who she is and why she ran way from Ai-Land. <br />  <br /> While the plot is a miss, the story itself is on a scale of 50/50. While this isn't Great Expectations, the dialoge is weak and sometimes makes no sense. For example, if Ai is always comaplaining about having no memories, then why does she &quot;suddenly&quot; remember certain events? Some are given explainations, but most of the time, they fly in like a blinded bat: They have no guidence, but are put in to keep the story going. <br />  <br /> Whiel reading, the entire volume made me uncomfertable. It reminded me too much of Courtney Love. Granted authors, comic book artists, ect. will base some of their personality traits into their characters, but Princess Ai was like reading something by or even listening to Courtney. Thus, this made the characters and even the romance between Ai and Kent VERY perdictible. You knew how each charcter was going to act, especially Ai and Kent (whom Love based it on her late husband, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana). Even the constant refernce to Ai's heart-shaped box chain is a direct referance to Cobain's song of the same title...come on, Courtney, leave those petty, cheesy referances to fan-fic writers! <br />  <br /> The only thing I loved about this manga was the art. Misaho Kujiradou's drawings are stunning and make you want to turn the page to see more. But, the only flaw to them are that her charcters designs of Ai and Kent are a little too similar to that of Love and Cobain. Other than that, Princess Ai is not a so-called &quot;Shojo-Goth Romance&quot; manga. It's more of a poor example of auto-biographical comics gone horrible wrong.	2004-07-22

While volume 1 was a drag, for readers who gave this series a chance and read volume 2, the reader is finally given a break and is treated to an actually story!<br />Picking up where the last volume poorly left off, Meg awakens from her \\"dream\\" to Merridiah and discovers that her pyschologist is not what he seems and also finds out that her friend, Dagny, also has encountered a man VERY similar to her doctor. Meanwhile, AJ catches up with his friend and roommate Thomas and some light is shown on what Meg's true purpose in Merridiah actually is. <br />The biggest improvement readers will notice is that Rikki and Tavisha have lightened up on the words. Instead of filling page after page of complicated, useless words and paragraphs, they have decided to give the reader a chance to get to know the characters and the enviroment inwhich they are placed in. Within this volume, we get a more filling introduction to Thomas, who seems to have another personality called \\"Tina\\", inwhich he dresses like a 1920s flapper. He provides a comical, yet sympathic role which is charming. Our other new face is Meg's best friend Dagny. She is almost identical to Meg, yet Dagny seems less nerotic and more down to earth than our main character. Plus, like Thomas, she also provides a comical and sympathic role, mixed with the right amount of sugar, spice and everything nice. <br />Readers are also treated to more lush and detailed scenes of Merridiah, particularly withhin the university. One of my favorite scenes involves AJ carrying Meg across the university grounds at night time. The scenes that follow are utterly beautiful and romantic; you can almost feel like you yourself are flying through the grounds. Speaking of romance, the ending leaves the reader hints of a possible romance between Meg and AJ (which I hope will be revealed in future volumes).<br />After reading volume 2, Shutterbox has grown on me. It reminds me of Labyrinth, due to it's romantic gothic tones and style. I simply cannot wait until future volumes are released! So, once again, give Shutterbox a chance...you'll be surprized on how wonderful this series is.	2004-07-12
US	47513432	R28MYLN23E1S7D	1591823617	977544154	ShutterBox, Book One: Orientation, Damien, Adrien and the Running of the Hyperpans	Books	3	3	4	N	N	A Great, But Confusing, Start.	I had first heard about Rikki and Tavisha through Invader Zim. While Rikki is best known for voiceing eveyone's favorite robot GIR, he has also collaberated with his wife on the series Rankle and His Three Legged Cat and Reality Check. ShutterBox, a more gothic and mature series, has wonderful art and plot, but can leave the reader confused once they finish reading the first volume.<br />The plot deals with recent high school graduate Meg Amano witnessing a man supposedly drowning himself on a beach she and her friends are at. Soon, Meg is transported to the land of Merridiah, an alternate universe, whenever she falls asleep at night. There, she attends the land's university as a ShutterBox exchange student, learning to become a muse.<br />Tavisha is a wonderful artist and her style continues to mature and grows more eye-pleasing. I really enjoied the character designs and the incredible detail of the landscapes. Plus, the characters all are great. One of my favorite characters is Damien, AJ's older brother. His characterzation is perhaps one of the best that I have ever read. I love how flirty he is toward Meg; this really rounds out the character well. Similar to the Chesire Cat from Alice in Wonderland, he taunts and toys Meg with riddles and sarcastic quips that are irresistibly well-written and draw you in.   <br />On the otherhand, this is where the fault line is drawn. While the plot is the perfect bait, the actually dialoge is either a hit-or-miss. Some of parts are pure fillers; using fluff and &quot;pretty words&quot; to make the story more &quot;dark&quot;, but this leaves the reader confused and often causes him to loose his place. Other times, the dialoge is too simple and doesn't mix in at all. Also, the characters are slightly flawed. This happens to Meg the most. While she maybe somewhere between the ages of 16-18, she comes off as a little too &quot;teeny-bopper&quot;-like, resulting in becoming annoying rather fast. But that's the charm of her character: she is confused, yet remains mostly collected and accpects her surroundings. This also acts like a curve for Damien. While he's dialoge is well done, it can leave the reader very annoyed at times, due to the fact he teases Meg constantly.<br />Also, this volume should have been longer. This would have tied up any loose ends and make this volume a much more satisfied read. I also did not like how stereotypical gothic it was. While I certainly don't mind the gothic life style, it seems lately that it's becoming more and more mainstream and that it seems that it is starting to loose it's once &quot;indie&quot; (meaning, only a selected group of people know about it) edge.<br />But, if you can get past the faults, the first volume of ShutterBox is a great start. Hopefully, the later volumes will flesh out the characters and story, so give this series a go.	2004-06-18

If you haven't experienced the power of Shaman King yet, this second volume may or may not be a good place to start, but for all you action-buffs out there, Volume Two is right up your ally.<br />Starting after Yoh's fight with Ren, the reader is treated to a flashback to when Yoh was a young child and how he becomes obbsessed with his goal to becoming the Shaman King. We also get two new characters added to the already likeable cast: Anna, Yoh's strict and bossy fiancee and Jun, Ren's older sister who controls the corpse of famed action star Lee Bailong. Again, we are treated to another impressive battle with lots of hard punches, kicks and ghostly matches. <br />While this volume is basicly one big action-packed fight, a lesson is taught and learned (a common theme, no?). Still, one cannot admire and praise the art, story and characters that has put Shaman King on the map. More of the main character's personalities are revealed and Manta truly outshines Yoh in this department. While in the first volume he is shown as a wet blanket, he proves that this wet blanket has a strong backbone and will do anything for his friends! He proves this by risking his own safety while requiring a replacement sord for Yoh by getting into a fight with Ryu. Hey, what are friends for?<br />For anyone who became a fan through the anime, give the manga a go and see what you have been missing. For those who are already a fan of the manga, sit back and relax and take in all the action of this volume!	2004-05-16

But I was at my local dollar store and saw that they were carrying it for only a dollar! So, for whatever reason came over me, I picked up a copy and read it. Boy, what a big disapointment (which I figured it was)!<br />The plot is simple: A young girl named Holly has a natural talent for singing and wins a scholarship to the prestigious Harverty School of Music, which she has been eyeing. Her mother, Wanda, is a constant embrassasment to her. Plus, Wanda has a secret of her own, which leads in a struggle that could brake the bond between mother and daughter.<br />There are so many things wrong with this book. First off, the writing and pace of the story is done rather quickly, making the reader \\"hungry\\" for more. Also, the cookie-cutter characters are not believable, which also make the book strain. The plot is very good, but when you get characters that have rather silly names (such as McSpadden, for example) and among other things, it makes you think twice as to how much throught Britney and her mom, Lynne, put into it. The only pure reason why this \\"novella\\" was at all published is because of Britney's once-popular star power. <br />The one thing I most disliked about the book was it's treatment of the how the bond between a mother and her daughter will combat over anything and everything. It's very common for writers' to take their own experiences and intergrate them into their works, but this is complete ridiculous! The trails that Wanda and Holly go through seem empty; there is no meat added to this story. Plus, as the old saying goes, if you got the natural talent to write, then do so. But, it seems that Britney and Lynne need a few lessons in English Grammer first before they attempt to publish another novel.<br />If you want a better portral of mother-daughter bonding, I highly reccommend Any Tan's The Joy Luck Club. Other than that, this is stricly to tweens and teeny-boppers only!	2004-02-03

Simply a target to male audiences (and to show how Madhouse (the animation company who made the OVA) and CLAMP work well together), it will offend some and it will be loved by some.<br />Now we get the orginal manga version. It included other stories that the OVA didn't mention, but the permis is still the same: Miyuki is a school girl who goes to various &quot;lands&quot; where she is ambushed by all-female casts who hit on her. From reading this, it's nothing more than CLAMP making references to other movies, books, ect and even themselves! Here's the lowdown:<br />Miyuki-chan in Wonderland/Look Glass Land--these two are obvious, so no need to go into explenation.<br />Miyuki-chan in TV Land--a simple padory of the old Barbarella movie.<br />Miyuki-chan in Part-Time Job Land--this makes fun of part-time workers and waitresses (anyone for a trip to Anne Miller?)<br />Miyuki-chan in Mah-Jongg Land--It takes the term &quot;Strip Poker&quot; to a whole new level!<br />Miyku-chan in Video Game Land--A padory of the entire Fantasy RPG genra, but also made me think of Record of the Lodoss War and even CLAMP poking fun of the Magic Knight Rayearth game for the Sega Saturn.<br />Miyuki-chan in X Land--CLAMP making fun of CLAMP! Take a guess at which manga they choose.<br />So, in conclusion, CLAMP proves that they are talented and can briidge from one genra to the next. While this the farthest they have gone, Chobits does play up on the peverted factor (but not as bad as Miyuki-chan). This is strictly for CLAMP fanatics only!	2003-12-23

After seeing the first episode (and only the first episode), Shaman King drew me in. Then, and lucky to work in a bookstore, I was able to purchase Volume 1. <br />First things first, yes, the Shaman King anime blows on FoxBox becuase of the editing. It's gonna end up like Sailor Moon: Most of the episodes are heavly edited due to the trageted audience (kids and tweens). Also, this is not the Japanese's fault. They, and the American distributers, decide who their target audience is and go through together and edit the episodes. It's the same with Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh! and just about every kids-targeted anime. However, many American manga companies (like Tokyo Pop) do not edit the orginal manga. All they do is the English translation (which includes foot notes for certin Japanese references) and that's it! Plus, the manga is always 10x better than the anime. And maybe someday they'll release the unedited anime just like they did with Sailor Moon.<br />With that said, the Shaman King manga is one of the most entertaining, page-turning and orginal mangas out there. The plot deals with a middle school shaman named Yoh Asakura. He transfers to Tokyo in order to continue training for his goal: To become the Shaman King. Along the way, he befriends another student, the ever-nerotic Manta Oyamaoa, who can also see ghosts and spirits just like Yoh. Together, they are paired up with the ghost of a dead samurai named Amidamaru, who is Yoh's partner in his quest. In the first volume, readers learn about what it takes to be a shaman and even get a taste of some inpressive Shaman duels. <br />The story is funny and is sprinkled with bits of dark humor and drama, plus it keeps you focused and leaves you craving for more! the art style is a balanced mixture of cartoony and sharp, dark line and appeals to both genders (male and female). While Shaman King is featured in the English version of Shonen Jump (a magazine geared to boys),girls will swoon over Yoh, feel sympathy towards Manta, and boo at the villains. Plus, Yoh's girlfriend Amy prooves that girls can be just as brash and compelling as the guys.<br />I urge anyone to check out Shaman King. If you enjoy appealing art, excellent story telling and manga in general, Shaman King is right up your ally!	2003-11-02

Phillip Pullman has now become one of my all time favorite authors. After writting the pervious two novels in His Dark Materials (The Golden Compass and The Subtile Knife), I eargerly bought The Amber Spyglass. <br />With his tradmark flare and skills, Pullman creates a dark, wonderful and tragic ending to his triology. It picks up right where The Subtile Knife left off. From the first chapter on, there's no rear-view mirror on the Pullam car. The War between Heaven and Hell starts and our young heroes learn the vaules of love and loss, good and evil, and the most important aspect, the complex characterzation of man. <br />There are no words that can describe how excellent and rewarding this series is. You just have to read it for yourself! And good news for all us His Dark Materials junkies: The long-awaited \\"Lyra's Oxford\\" will be availble toward the end of this month. We will get a first-hand glance at Lyra's new life after the Triology and a detailed look at Pullman's fictional Oxford.	2003-10-19

While the world is ingulfed in the like of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and others of the like, I just happened to wonder on the Teens section of randomhouse.com and this book caught my eye. After reading a few pages while I was on break at work, I simply had to buy a copy and read it.<br />Taking insperation (and borrowing heavly from Anne McCaffrey), enter the newest teen-age author Christopher Paolini's massive (yes, a hefty 500+ pgs.) debut novel. The plot is about a young 16 year old boy named Eragon who discovers a shiny blue stone while out on a hunting trip. Hoping to sell it for food, he takes it home and discovers that it is actually a dragon egg. The dragon hatches and Eragon's simple, farm-boy life is changed forever. After nearly lossing everything dear to him, Eragon is forced to leave by Brom, the village story-teller (who has a few secrets of his own), who accompanies him on his journey into the detailed world of Alagaesia, a Tolkin-like land full of evil creatures, dwarves, elves, and many more who will become Eragon's allies and enemies.<br />And that's just Book I! Currently, Paolini is hard at work writting Eldest, Book II. While readers eagerly await that novel, Eragon is, by far, the best in what a teen author can produce. While Amelia Atwater-Rhodes may have started the trend, she still has a lot to learn about exceptional grammer and just writting a novel all together. Paolini goes to great lenghts to give his readers a detailed and impressive story that is an udder joy to read. It's hard to imagine that he started this novel when he was only 15!<br />Eragon is seemingly flawless. You get a colorful cast of characters, gorgous landscapes, a plot that doesn't try to hard to be impressvie and flashy, and doesn't live you a rotten cliff-hanger. All in all, I cannot find anything that is wrong with novel.<br />However, my only real complant is that Eragon is a little too \\"meaty\\". The novel doesn't need to be 500+ pages (a standerd 300-350+ is an average for most novels, especially for the start of a Triology such as this) and I found myself wondering on several occassions. But, neverless, I forged on, greatly apperciating on Paolini's masterful skills with the pen.<br />I would recommend anyone who enjoies book like Harry Potter, or just an avid reader of Sci-Fi/Fantasy!an average for most novels, especially for the start of a Triology such as this) and I found myself wondering on several occassions.

After reading her last effort, the dissapointing Midnight Predator, I had almost lost my faith in Amelia's creditbility as a teen author. But when I found out her next book, Hawksong, was about to be released, I decided to give her one more chance. After picking the book up, I was able to take my time with this book. <br />Taking a much needed break from the world of witches and vampires, Rhodes treats us to a world ruled by two breeds of shape-shifters (One is avian; the other is serpienten). A war that has been going on for ages leaves the heir to the avain throne, Danica Shardae, to achieve the goal of creating peace between the two lands. With the help (an a forced marriage) to Zane Corbriana, heir to the serpienten throne, they must try to put their differences aside and start the long road to peace.<br />Hawksong, in case you didn't know, is Book I in a series of four planned by Rhodes. The writing has diffently matured and has become more descriptive since Amelia's first novel, which was the biggest welcomed change. I haven't seen people complain (yet) if Hawksong is a rip-off of an L. J. Smith novel (Midnight Predator) or a knock-off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Shattered Mirror), but to me this seems to be more orginal than the other four books. I would happen to agree with most reviewers that this is her best offering so far, but we'll just have to wait until the next three are published in order to justify this. Also, she has improved on characticterzation. No more 2D, cookie-cutters here.  <br />But with most of Rhodes' books, she still has flaws. The most common is her tendency to \\"over-dramitize\\". While she has lightened up on this through out most of the book, she still has hints of it in some passages. Amelia also has a problem with description. She will often give her readers too little or too much, which will throw you off.<br />If anyone wants to get into Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, suggest this book!	2003-08-05

While I will admit that this is one of the best descriptions of a former mental insitution pacient, Kaysen created incredible short chapters and it's too scattered (the film adaption puts all the events in cronological order). <BR>Also, I also didn't like how Kaysen blabs in the last two chapters. To me, the conclusion felt too much like &quot;filler&quot; words it was like taking in too much of a good thing. It is best of she just kept it a chapter short, I would've been able to handle it better.	2003-07-19

It intriged me, so I picked up a copy and read it. I was glad I did.<BR>Being brought up in such a tech-savy world that we live in, I could easily understand most of the story, though some of the cut scenes where rather confusing at some points. I also got confused about how the Sumerian myth played into the story, but the ending chapters explained the connection clearly.<BR>The characters where all colorful and different. This is also one of the few books (not counting comics, manga, ect.) that features a non-white person as the main character (Hiro Protagonist), which should be done more often. <BR>As many reviewers have pointed out (and I can agree with them on this), it is a though you where reading the script for a Japanese Anime movie or series, if you like that sort of media (and I do with glee!). I would love to see this as either a live-action or an animated movie, since it desperatly cries out to be one.	2003-05-31

So, I was happy to finaly pick up Midnight Predator, but I was left disapointed. While I did enjoy her first three novels, the whole vampire, witches, shape-shifter, ect. plots and charcters are becoming rather tiresome and incredible over-used. While I do enjoy the works of such masters as H.P. Lovecraft and Steven King just to name a few, I personally feel that Atwater-Rhodes' should try writting something else, like her fellow authors have done (King has even written a rather enjoible fantasy novel called In the Dragon's Eye--pick it up, it's a great treat for any Steven King fan). Varity is the key to an author's success.	2003-05-30

After finishing it, I was glad I picked it up. <BR>The main plot puts the main character Lyra on an incredible journey that has danger at nearly ever turn to which she seeks out the question that puzzles all: What is Dust? She is also on a quest to save her friend Roger from The Gobblers, who inturn have their own plans with the dozens of children they capture. I can't give too much away, but since this is Book I in a series of three, this is a nice kick off to Pullam's His Dark Materials trilogy. He manages to create vivd, Narnia-esque scenery and flare within every turn of the page, leaving you wanting to read on. <BR>The only flaws I could only point out where that he created Lyra to act like a young teen; perhaps somewhere between the ages of 13 to 15 (She is in truth 11, but her characterzation makes her appear much older) and their are sections inwhich he tries to be too political and scientific, thus creating long and boring conversations and sequences that I had skipping through and having to re-read in order to piece the story. I also felt that, despite this is a so called \\"young adult novel\\", adults would understand it fairly well too without feeling dumbed down by the vocabulary and such. <BR>All in all, if you enjoy a good fantasy novel, this is a much read.	2003-05-26

Suddenly, Alex is left in abandonment by his friends and is arrested in a failed break-in.

While the vocabulary is often confusing and can leave the reader dumb-founded, Burgess based it on the slang of the British and the Russians, which has promted many to formate their own lists of translations, which are proven helpful.<BR>The novel left me amazed and pondering those questions for the longest of time.

I first heard about this book while reading an article about it in Entertainment Weekly. From it, I wanted to read the book so I bought a copy of it at my local Barnes and Noble. After I finished reading it, I can't wait until I get my hands on the second volume. It was a nice change from the maddness of Harry Potter and, in fact, I believe it was much better. While the formula for dropping a young teen into a world of magic, mystery and danger has been proven to work over the years for some authors, Barker's re-telling of the formula is done in his own unquie way that it out-shines Ms. Rowlings (although it will never achive the success that her books have had). The art that Barker has painted himself really gives readers a sense on what the world of Abarat looks like, though I still would have liked to imagine what the actual landscape, people and animals in my head instead of having someone draw them out. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoied Barker's beautiful and eerie paintings, but they were often too bright and cheery to suit the story, which did have it's dark periods. The story itself is more Narina than Alice in Wonderland (although there was a hint of it in some parts) and it kept me wanting to read more. The only fear of mine that I have about the future of this series is that Abarat might, just might, end up like Harry Potter, thanks to commercilization. Why I mention this is because Barker recently signed a deal with Disney to produce a movie(s) and a park attraction based on his work. And with the way Disney has been having moderate sales lately with it's newer animation projects and live-action movies, they're taking a big gamble with Abarat. This could either make it or brake it for Disney, so we'll just have to wait and see.	2003-03-12
