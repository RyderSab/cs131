US	52262073	R18RZERUJM80O6	0399144498	281434626	Lindbergh	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Balanced portrayal of both Lindberghs:  public &amp; private	I thought Berg did an excellent job portraying both sides of Lindbergh:  the public one as well as the private one.  I admire and respect Lindbergh for his accomplishments.  He was in a difficult position...flew the  Atlantic at age 25...then had to face intense media exposure for the rest  of his life.  He faced attention equal only to Princess Diana, Kennedy's,  &amp; the OJ trial.  Now personally, he was a cold, unlikeable person who  should never have married or had children.  I was appalled at his treatment  of Anne during the Hauptmann trial (calling her a failure).  It was a very  disfuctional marriage.  He always dragged her around to new homes (&amp; on  months long trips after each baby was born) to always keep her focus on  him.  Yet, Berg points out that she enjoyed playing the victim.  I thought  the writer's portrayal of his racial beliefs were balanced; he provided the  quotes from Lindbergh's speeches and diaries.  I can't caomprehend how  Lindbergh could feel such sadness at the allies' treatment of Germans  following the war &amp; Japanese victims of bombing raids, yet never feel  horror at the Holecaust or Japanese atrocities.	1999-08-14

It is a difficult read in the 1st third of the book, but then picks up.  The author makes excellent points.  The last several chapters dealing with the cold  war &amp; west/east Europe during the last 20 years were the most  interesting part of the book, especially the pages dealing with the recent  wars in Yugoslovia (Bosnia, Kosovo, etc.)	1999-07-11

The portrayal of Caesar was thorough and interesting, but at times I found it  hard to relate to him personnally...probably because it's a 2 thousand year  old story.  The best part of the book was the portrayal of the Roman  Republic and its fall.  I found very interesting Meier's descriptions of  the paradoxes existing in the republic.	1999-06-06

The writers pointed out that the US was holding much of the allies' treasury bills, especially England's; in fact, the Federal Reserve Board warned US banks in 1918 of  holding too many of the Allies' securites.  The discussion on the peace  negotiations and treaties was also excellent, pointing out the problem was  not placing harsh terms on the Germans, but not enforcing the treaty.  The  writers also correctly linked both World Wars together into a 30 year war,  and pointed out that Germany never accepted that it had lost the War.  I  also agreed with the book's premise that the US retreating into  isolationism was the first domino sending the world to the 2nd world war.   They logically portrayed how the belligerents' ending positioned set up  World War II.	1999-06-06

Unlike many other founding fathers who never made it outside of  Independence Hall, Hamilton served in the military under Washington.  The  portrayal of Burr was also interesting.  Revisionists have painted Burr as  being a moderate recently, but the biographer points out that Washington  never trusted him or had much use for him.  Unlike other great men who lose  your respect the more you learn about them, I respected Hamilton more after  reading the book.	1999-06-06

The  descriptions of the country's jails and Mandela's stay at Robbin Island  makes you ill but increase your respect for Mandela and all other political  prisoners.  Meredith also does a good job describing the sulkiness of De  Klerk and his disappointment at not being recognized equally as Mandela for  ending apartheid...maybe if he had been in prison for 29 years...	1999-06-06

Stephan Sears' discussion of Hooker's performance at Chancellorsville was the most interesting, and made me reconsider my previous opinions on him.

For me, he also lost some of the luster.  For the most part, he seems incredibly self-centered.  Absolutely no military experience  &amp; he's running around (&amp; his mouth as well)in Cuba.  Thank goodness  he &amp; Taft split the Republican vote...I shudder to think how many  American lives would have been lost if we had entered World War I in 1914.

The history is of ideas and key trends.  There are no dates, no people.  He does a wonderful job tying everything together. Too often history is presented in a manner that shows us the trees, but not  the forest.  The author shows us the forest.  The chapter on America  explains in only 20 pages the significance of our country better than any  book I've read.  It's a &quot;thinking&quot; book.  Even though it's only  200+ pages, I found myself stopping to think about key paragraphs every few  pages.  He put all of history's key players, wars, countries, etc. into  complete context with each other.	1999-05-17

I've also wondered how history could be so sure that he killed the princes. He sets the stage nicely &amp; introduces all the key characters. He also evaluated  the credibility of past historians (More up through Weir) and their  &quot;evidence&quot;.  He made the mystery seem like a current case rather  than occurring 500 years ago. He convinced me! He also made me realize the  significance of &quot;pretender&quot; revolts during Henry VII's rule.	1999-05-17

The book is not as bad as the one star reveiw, but not great either.  It's a good introductory biography of Pershing.

The writer is extremely one sided and inaccurate in his portrayal of various presidents' moral substance.  One of the worst portrayals is Jackson.  He believes that he was moral because he read the Bible daily and  was against big government.  He doesn't believe Jackson's Indian policy  (Trail of Tears among other incidences)should be held against him.  In  fact, he even puts some of the blame for the Trail of Tears on the  Cherokee.  The entire book contained similar rewriting of history.  Hopefully no one will read his book, and if they do, won't believe his  &quot;history&quot;.	1999-03-05

The writer does an excellent job writing about 2 little known, but important strategically, battles in Mississippi following Shiloh.  He writes about the common soldier as well as the generals.  His descriptions  of the battles are as suspenseful as any adventure story...even though you  know who won the battles.  As well as providing details of the battles, he  also writes about the strategic big picture.  His characterizations of the  generals are also superb.	1999-02-16

The best essays were about the &quot;real&quot; Chamberlain, how JEB Stuart's cavalry really impacted the battle, &amp; whether Longstreet and Sickles  really messed up.  Contrary to the 1st reviewer below, the writer does  believe that Sickles made a mistake moving to the peach orchard.  The best  essay was about the common soldier.

The story is fascinating.  The author beginning the story with how he gained interest in the subject sets the stage &amp; reels you in.  the details capture your attention.  He  reviews a 500 year map drawn by a monk &amp; discovers the  latitude/longitude numbers were switched.  Therefore this map &amp; all  other maps copied off it to modern times are wrong...the city is in a  different location.  the part of the book dealing with being in the middle  east &amp; the dig, brings archaeology to life.  I enjoyed reading an  account of a person who isn't a scientist.  It was like taking part in an  Indiana Jones movie.	1999-01-27

The author does an excellent job portraying the characters from Benedict Arnold to Burgoyne  and the rest.  I enjoyed most his depiction of what living in the New  York/Vermont area was like.  It was the frontier; settlers were still  subject to Indian attack.  The logistical challenges for both sides were  also masterfully presented, from moving guns, getting food, to exchanging  messages.	1999-01-27

I've suffered through her recent books over the last several years, hoping with each one that it will be like her old ones.  I like that she keeps bringing old  favorite characters into her new books, but then the newer books have  inacurrate details that conflict with her older books.

The portrayals of  Washington, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson, etc were wonderfully sarcastic  &amp; humerous.  I've always wondered as Burr if the members of Continental  Congress were such patriots why weren't they out with the troops getting  shot at.

I reread it every few months &amp;  always find something new.  Shaara highlights the absurdity of the  Confederate cause.  His southern soldiers' characters talking about  fighting for their rights made me sick; fighting for their rights so they  can take away others' rights.  Chamberlain's character is my favority.  His  speeches about the divine spark in humans &amp; the reason for the war are  like poetry. Buster's character portray's the immigrant well, with his  speech about proving that he's more than the place he was born into.  His  portrayals of Buford &amp; Longstreet are also well done.	1998-08-23

Cummings lays  out America's bungling in another Asian country before Vietnam. &amp; even  now.  He also provides the civil rights abuses in South Korea that were  occurring up to the 1980's.  He also explains the current Western false  thinking of North Korea as a renegade state and thinking of reunification  in terms of Germany's.  Unfortunately the book only goes up to 1996, &amp;  doesn't cover the 1997 South Korean economic meltdown &amp; IMF bailout.   This would change substantially Cummings opinions &amp; predictions for  South Korea.  For example, he predicts that Kim Dae Jung will never win  politcal office, which has occurred in the past year.	1998-08-23

The author will mention substantiating evidence, but then  never provide it.  For example, she refers to archaeology work done at  Little Bighorn but never says what it is.  The book focuses way too much on  Custer's wife...for a biography of him.  There are 100 pages dealing with  her widowhood. After reading the book, I don't know any more about Custer  than I did before reading it.  I had expected some sort of biography since  the title reads &quot;the life &amp; death&quot; &amp; then meaning of the  myth from that, but the book didn't deliver.	1998-08-23

Obviously they didn't  read the entire book; some of their points were incorrect.  Even though  there is no bibiography, there were detailed footnotes to quotes &amp;  other information.  The bibiography would have put the sources in  alphabetical order, but some trees were saved instead.  And the comment  regarding Grant being unfair to Meade? He was far more patient than he  should &amp; have been, &amp; unfortunately people died as a result.  The  author is more even handed with criticisms up through Grant being elected  President.  Yes, he was unfair to Thomas, but as the author says Thomas's  personality &amp; style did not fit Grant's.  I thought the author was too  kind regarding Grant's presidency.  His assertion of Grant as a economics  wizard was a little much.  I've never bought the view that he was very  naive &amp; didn't realize the corruption that was going on.  It doesn't  fit.	1998-08-23

The author depicts William Henry Harrison as a manipulative, greedy &amp; sometimes untruthful individual.  Most people are aware of the native American treaties that the government negotiated &amp; broke with the Plains Indians later in the century; the book details the  interactions between the government &amp; Indians in an earlier time period.

The portrayal of Sherman does not always flatter Sherman, but the indepth analysis of his character &amp; personality paint a very interesting individual. Sherman always said what he mean &amp; he acted true to his convictions.  I found amusing his comments on reporters &quot;I'll hang the first reporter I find in my camp as a a spy&quot;.

I suspect they're probably in the military.  The book describes the occurences that caused people of my generation to have little respect for the military.  It makes me furious that taxpayers paid for immature pilots to go on yearly boondoggles in Las Vegas so they could be criminals.

I hadn't read any detailed reviews, so didn't realize it was meant to symbolize King Lear. I liked the way she built the characters.  I would feel sorry for one &amp; then later completely despise him.  I enjoyed her using the Midwest &amp; farming as a background.  As someone who grew up in very rural Indiana, the background was very familiar to me and struck a chord.  The story always had hidden currents.  You knew from the beginning that there were secrets.  Her book also showed that the truth is in part what each individual perceives it to me.  Each sister had different memories &amp; therefore different truths.	1998-07-04

I did not select the book for an intensive portray of his Civil War military activites.  I wanted to gain insight of the inner man, which the book provided.  I enjoyed especially the glimpses of him as father (watching over his injured young son, his writing to a daugher of her illegible letter) and his views of child rearing &amp; education.  The only part I had problems with was his portray of Longstreet.  It seems that authors either favor Lee &amp; completely discredit Longstreet, or vice versa.  I would have liked to understood why he chose to walk away from his US Army responsibility to uphold the Union &amp; the Constitution, but that comes from living in the modern era.	1998-07-02

I enjoyed the insight into his life.  My prior knowledge of him was from school; all I really knew was that he was John Adams' son &amp; was a rather grumpy president.  There is so much to the man.  He had a very cosmopolitan childhood accompanying his father to Europe.  He was so accomplished, but he never felt satisfied with himeself.  I was struck at the way his parents, &amp; he in turn with his children, expressed their love and concern for him.  Their letters and coversations continually put pressure on him.  I wonder if children were universally reared at that time with such a lack of joy and pressure. I also was fascinated with what screw-ups his siblings &amp; 2 oldest sons were.  Poor John &amp; Abagail had 1 grownup son &amp; his family (7 kids) living with them as well as raising other grandchildren.  I was a little surprised that the book didn't focus much on his presidential term.  But as the author says, he didn't accomplish much as president.  I enjoyed learning that he developed the Monroe Doctrine and had impact on the use of the Smithson legacy (became the Smithsonian Institution).  I was so interested in the Adams family after reading the book, that I right away read Nagel's earlier book about the family (Descent from Glory); it nicely supplemented the JQA biography.	1998-07-02

As someone who was born in the 60's &amp; was 11 at the time of the Saigon airlift, I knew very little about the war except what I'd seen on the TV show Mash (actually portrayed Korean War) &amp; the movie Platoon.  Despite having relatives who faught in Vietnam, no one every spoke of the war in front of me as a child.  McNamara's book gives the impression that he, JFK, &amp; LBJ all meant well, but things got away from them, the slippery slope argument.  McMasters provides ample proof of McNamara's complete lack of ethics, &amp; his continuing lying and machinations.  No one in his book escapes blame.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff continually were selfish &amp; would not fulfill their Constitutional obligations.  McNamara's insistence on using &quot;superior&quot; analytical techniques was laughable, as well as his belief that his experience from the Cuban Missile Crisis translated into him knowing better than the military how to proceed in Vietnam.  I can't say that I actually enjoyed the book; the content made me angry.  But it cleared up misconceptions from McNamara's book &amp; is especially important to people of my generation, who don't know much about what happened in Vietnam.  Also, I kept thinking throughout the book that JFK appointing McNamara as Secretary of Defense was a loss for the country, but what a gain for Ford Corporation.
