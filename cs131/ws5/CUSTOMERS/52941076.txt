There are hundred of reviews, so I'll be brief: An old man dies saving a little girl.  In the afterlife, five people -- some he knows, some complete strangers -- take turns explaining how events in his life have impacted the lives of others.  Much to his surprise, the lives of others have had an equally profound impact on his own life.  The reader learns that at the core of this cynical, resentful old man is a lonely individual who longs for the woman he loves, and the acceptance of an absent father.  This book is rich in its character development and deeply profound in its underlying message, which is simply this: We are here to do what we are here to do.  Grown men will cry.  I sure did.	2004-06-07

You'll primarily learn (1) how to migrate legacy HTML markup and (2) how to write new XHTML from the ground up.  This book does well to cite available software to help you with both the conversion as well as the creation of XHTML.  Towards the end of the book, the authors go into application-specific XML vocabularies and technologies designed to transform or style XHTML.<br />Novices will do great with this approach, but experienced web developers already knowledgeable with XML technologies may find the coverage of XSLT, CSS, etc. redundant with their other readings and/or life experiences.  I've been in web dev for 6 years, so I was able to stop reading after Chapter 5.  Perhaps this book may be construed as too shallow for the experienced developer.  Or, perhaps there really isn't much more to say about XHTML to justify a thicker book.  I won't know personally until I read at least one other book on the subject.<br />If you are new to XHTML -- as well as XML technology in general -- this book is great way to learn about the related technologies quickly.	2004-02-21

Don't expect this book to give you an answer on how to find your next career.  Mr. Bronson is a little &quot;preachy&quot; (he admits as much), with just a smidgeon of self-glorification.  I would have preferred that he kept himself out of the book and stuck to writing about the people he interviewed (he had more than enough material).<br />Do hope to find one or more stories that you can relate to, perhaps opening up new possibilities for where you might go in life.  Not to be taken as purely objective, Bronson collects his interviews and re-tells them from the perspective of his own opinion on how one should go about changing careers.  He did find some fascinating persons to include in this book, many of whom chose a selfless path, and choosing not to take one of greed nor vanity.	2003-06-17

In my personal experience, making a purchasing experience based upon reading the product description and/or publishers' review is a hit-or-miss attempt.<br />&quot;Oracle DBA&quot; is the perfect read if you have never used Oracle tools and don't know where to begin.  Just as importantly, if you are stuck with installing and maintaining an Oracle database on a Linux system, this book shows you the basics.  I haven't read through the entire book yet, but given that I know *nothing* about Oracle and very little about Linux, what I've read so far has already put me in control of my database.  How &quot;deep&quot; this book goes into administration I don't know yet, but so far it has provided for my most immediate needs.<br />This book is not for you if you are just learning fundamental database principles.  If you don't know what a database schema is, or if you don't know how to write SQL, for example, you need to read something else.  This book probably isn't for you if you are an experienced Oracle DBA and are looking for advanced techniques.	2002-09-11

The story's setting made the story very approachable for me. I received the book yesterday, and I finished it this morning! The words of Blue Road's simple tale flow as easily as water, and one can't help but feel swept away as you follow the adventures of two sea-dwelling friends.<br />\\"Blue Road to Atlantis\\" is a joyful reminder of one of the most profound lessons I have learned earlier in life: Be who you are.  Doesn't make sense? Read the book! Sometimes one needs gentle reminders and this book did exactly that for me. For other readers, it may unlock a new perspective never before realized.  This book introduces what I would say is the \\"tao\\" or the \\"zen\\" in \\"Old Man in the Sea\\", for reasons I invite you to find out for yourself. You'll be pleasantly surprised, touched and hopefully motivated to reflect on your own life and evaluate what your true path is.	2002-08-07

Secondly, this book is targeted towards non-programmers, with little or no knowledge of basic programming language constructs. Thirdly, after reading two other \\"Definitive\\" books from O'Reilly, this publishing format is becomming a bit dull and is no longer effective for maintaining my attention span. A bit dry.<br />That said, if you are a non-programmer this book is an excellent guide to ActionScript.  It covers basic concepts, language syntax and application.  Experienced developers can opt to skim or skip the first one-third of the book, since the language is based on Javascript and builds on programming principles that are already familiar.  Just keep in mind that the book does not mention new, changed or deprecated featues in Flash MX (Version 6).<br />One criticism that I have so far is the section on movie clips.  The data structures related to these built-in objects are rather difficult to understand and this book, IMO, does not fully illuminate these details.  It explains what the structure and behavior are, but for me this limits me to rote memorization of rules.  If the book were to go a bit into \\"why\\", it would make this much more clearer for the reader.<br />As for the Actionscript the language (not this book), it is a very powerful adaptation of Javascript/Ecmascript, however I'm finding it breaks down when it comes to modeling complex class hierarchies.  It lacks the convenience of other languages such as Java or C++, and you'll find you'll have to do a bit more heavy lifting to achieve some of the same effects.  But because Actionscript is intended to be the \\"glue\\" that drives a Flash movie, its practical use will probably not often require such complexity in object design.  Indeed, it seems to do a very good job of adding programmability to Flash.	2002-07-19

They do so for both client-based and web-based applications. I learned more than I thought I would about non-English languages and how vastly they can differ from our own. The real find is in their coverage of Unicode, explaining what it hopes to achieve and how it impacts your Java programming.<br />I would say the next revision (if there's going to be one) would benefit by expanding font installation in other operating systems. Not too surprisingly, they cover only Windows, as it has the best unicode support today. However, TrueType support is possible on the Unixes, if you know how. I'd be curious to know how it would be possible on Mac OS X. The book would also benefit from expanded discussion on internationalizing web applications. It only covers display issues. The authors cite not wanting to cover issues surrounding web-based data entry and database operations because other authors discuss them, but those are relevant topics, IMO. After all, they discussed Swing-based data entry, so why not web forms? I was hoping for more complete coverage, as I am working on a I18N project now. But I'll have to hunt around for other books for the topics I could not read about here.<br />Overall, this book is a great buy. Modern software developers would be foolish to not familiarize themselves with the I18N APIs in today's global economy.	2001-08-17

I find this writing style to be compatible with how I learn new technology.  <br />Specifically, they systematically provide the big picture by explaining JSP's overall relevance in Java technology.  Then they break it down by going over the main parts of JSP architecture.  If you're in a hurry to bang out some code to make your content more dynamic, reading the first four to seven chapters will get you going, depending on your specific needs.  They're not big chapters.  Starting with Chapter 8, the authors provide you with techniques and example applications.  I haven't gotten all the way through the latter chapters, but it appears that you can refine your application of the technology here.<br />I find the book's organization to be well thought out, which makes for more enjoyable reading.	2001-03-02

It has almost everything you would need to know about.<br />I have to work a little to find the information I need, as (of course) Ozawa organizes information differently from the way it's presented to students in the school that I attend.  But it's all there, if you know what you're looking for.  It's unfortunate that there isn't any information on shinai or armor maintenance.<br />This book is an excellent guide throughout your Kendo training.	2001-02-05

A table of style attributes adorn the inside of the covers.  This alone makes the book worth the price.  I frequently refer to this table.  Inside, the authors carefully explain stylesheets, from their basic composition and application, all the way to advanced features.  This book does not spell out the browser-specific implementation, but rather the CSS standards.  I look for books just like this one -- well-written (easy to read), straight-forward and well-designed.	2000-11-03
US	52941076	R3DY5V9XP6HH4	0136805965	102504068	Linux System Administration Handbook	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Appropriate for Beginners	This book is good as an introduction to Linix administration for readers who are completely new to Linix.  I concur with a number of the readers in that this book does lack depth.  For myself, it was useful in terms of the  breadth of information provided.  If you are completely new to this  operating system, this book suffices as an overview of common  administrative tasks.  You will get a basic feel for what needs to be done,  but you won't learn operating-system specifics for your particular  distribution of Linix.  My recommendation is that if you are new, use this  book as a start.  Identify why you are setting up a Linix server (or  workstation) and then jump to the appropriate chapters on that topic.  The  book is well-organized, so you'll have no problem finding your way around.   When you're ready, buy another book that focuses on what you're interested  in.	2000-06-25

His theme throughout the book is that every design decision you make must be in the interest of helping to communicate information to the reader. His basic messages are: There are too many sites on the web that display distracting, if not confusing, visual elements on their pages. Learning the technical details of web page implementation is not enough. You must also understand how to effectively provide information to your site's visitors.<br />As you progress through each chapter, he'll illustrate bad examples and then suggest improvements for them.  Some very good examples of what he feels is effective design are also presented.	2000-06-19

Reading it is like learning about what is possible, but you can't learn everything about DHTML.  The author really just provides examples of what  you can do, but he won't show you everything.  Keep in mind that this book  was published back when the then current version if Internet Explorer was  (I thought) the best implementation of DHTML, albeit non-standard.  And  that's the rub; the techniques the author demonstrates are browser-specific  and won't work universally, not even today.

I am using IE 4.72 and Netscape 4.61.  No cigar.  Unlike some of the other readers, I do not have  the expertise to correct the authors' mistakes on my own.  Worse, there is  no contact information for the authors.  The book is organized well, but  the authors really goofed on the cross-browser issues.  I've read perhaps  the first four chapters so far, and the most glaring error is with regard  to the visibility attribute.  The 'hidden' and 'visible' settings do not  work in Netscape Navigator (it's 'show' and 'hide', guys).  This is  disturbing as the authors suggest that one of the most common uses for  DHTML is making layers appear and disappear!	1999-09-17
