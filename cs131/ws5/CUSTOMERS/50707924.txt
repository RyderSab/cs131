You expect to open up to good tips on advertising, on imaging, on CHOOSING - spiced up with a lots of brilliant examples of beautiful, thoughtful, surprising, provocative, artistic image advertising.<br />But no. Not only does it seem as if a high school student with one year of Marketing studies has written it (both the knowledge and the language is on a disappointingly unprofessional level), the pictures in the book are even of poor quality. The examples are everything but inspiring, not the least original or well-chosen.<br />Furthermore, the categorisation of the images seems very awkward, like artificial. The printing quality is poor, the layout practically non-existing. AND several of the 'tips' given have no sense of reality and of the different markets (usually it's between 'USA' and 'Europe' and the author sadly seems to have no sense of the mentality in either!).<br />This is a sad, sad example of how poorly a book about advertising and/or image production can be done. 'Images That Sell' certainly won't stay in my bookshelf!	2004-01-07

For the book is not 'an introduction to an introduction' as its foreword states. It is more of an outline, with more deep-cut analysis of whatever the author happens to feel like going deeper into. The book can also serve as a reference on terminology.<br />But that's all, really...<br />Furthermore, it is far too theoretical and schematic. The examples are always taken from the same languages and are often very far-fetched.<br />It is a pity, for the subject does need a basic introduction book, a point to start. The best feature of 'Teach Yourself Linguistics' is that it might serve as an appetizer for what particular branch of linguistics one would want to explore further.	2001-10-15

The story is pretty much the same in those two novels, only is the main character's complex and slightly psychopathic personality different. In a way, the sheriff in »Pop. 1280« has more sympathetic sides than the deputy in »The Killer Inside Me«<br />Once again, JimThompson successfully creates a thrilling environment in a tiny Texan county, and it is all experienced from inside the killer's mind. This way of telling a story works out very well, it glues your eyes to the book - and what's more is that Jim Thompson writes with a lot of humour and sarcasm. This gives the whole thing even more spice, and is maybe even the best feature of »Pop. 1280«.<br />I am very close to grant this novel 4 stars, but somehow, all in all, the book disappoints compared to »The Killer Inside Me«. If you want well-written, straight-forward, and very (black-)humourous suspense, Jim Thomson is your man, and »Pop. 1280« is not at all a bad choice!	2001-01-19

Robert Bringhurst is a very good writer, with an unusually wide knowledge of not only typograpy, and therefore the book becomes extremely very relevant and not at all overspecialized.<br />Mr Bringhurst's writing skills and knowledge have also succeeded in creating what is rare among reference books: A reference book that you can actually read from one end to the other, which is what I did myself. Without getting bored, no, in fact it was hard for me to put »The Elements Of Typographic Style« down!<br />The only drawback is that, sometimes, Mr Bringhurst tends to make statements which he makes look like the only truth, despite his amazing knowledge of the subject. His solutions are often, but not always, discussed - and especially when they are not, it seems annoying to read about what is his personal taste and preferences.<br />But »The Elements Of Typographic Style« seems to me like a Bible of typography! An extremely relevant book that will open not only typographers', printers' and authors' eyes and make them at the very least a little more aware of what makes a written medium inviting and worth reading. Of course, this book itself is a beautiful example of well-taken care of typography and layout!	2001-01-13

Well, it does describe a lot of weird details of the region's history, geography and zoology some of which might be kinda funny when you're travelling there.<br />However, »In Patagonia« is more of a potpourri of human fates.

This makes the text clumsy and hollow. <br />The story is just OK. Nearly surrealistic in its playing around with reality and dream (without comparing to Milo Manara's genius in this area! ), and with past, present and future which however is taken on much too lightly. <br />And the drawings are, as always from Serpieri's hand, frighteningly fantastic!

After the amazing »American Psycho« - which did not only shock some with its explicity but also impressed us with its fantastic telling style - he has now come up with his 700 page novel  »Glamorama«.<br />The universe is the same as in his other books: among the  rich, the famous, the beautiful. But »Glamorama« is much less straight  forward than e.g. »American Psycho«. It is much more complex, and in fact  much more chilling.<br />Ellis is one of the few authors being able to  construct a main character who is in fact not very sympathetic. And yet he  leaves you no choice but to be with, to support this main character.<br />And  the effects used by Ellis are absolutely brilliant. Much better than in any  movie, and certainly without any clichés! Absolutely catching. Gives you  the chills...<br />A high-quality thriller. <br />It may be difficult to struggle  your way through the first hundred pages, especially if you have not read  any of Ellis' earlier work yet.

But still, the interviewer stays humble, asking  questions showing a profound knowledge of the subject. Since Woody Allen is  very good at answering in a direct but well thought about way, it never  gets boring and never seems primitive that the book is written simply in  direct dialogue.<br />What I personally appreciate as well is that the talk is  purely about film and about Woody Allen as an artist - his private life  does not enter unless it is closely related to the discussed subjects. So  you get a very relevant view to Woody Allen's career. Because of Stig  Björkman's high professionalism, and because of Woody Allen's conversation  talent and open mind.<br />It never gets too intellectual either. In fact, it  makes you want to watch the Woody Allen movies you haven't had the  opportunity to watch yet.<br />The only minus is that the book is some years  old so that it does not contain discussions on his recent very interesting  films.<br />But as it is an unrejectable document on film history, &quot;Woody  Allen On Woody Allen&quot; does belong on any film friends' bookshelf!	2000-01-29

It's not just that this book's story is seen from the sickly subtle mind of a raper, torturer and killer yuppie who just cannot satisfy his material and physical needs. It's more the unique way in which Bret Easton Ellis  tells the story.<br />His style is pure literary genius, I've never seen  anything like it! As a reader you feel like you're just standing there, in  the middle of it all. A style which creates an extremely intense  effect.<br />I only know two people apart from myself who have managed to read  »American Psycho« from the first to the last page.

Whether you love or hate Woody Allen's work, there is a great deal to learn on film history from this book. Stig Bjrkman knows so much about all aspects of  film and therefore delivers an outrageously professional interview. But  still, the interviewer stays humble, asking questions showing a profound  knowledge of the subject. Since Woody Allen is very good at answering in a  direct but well thought about way, it never gets boring and never seems  primitive that the book is written simply in direct dialogue. What I  personally appreciate as well is that the talk is purely about film and  about Woody Allen as an artist - his private life does not enter unless it  is closely related to the discussed subjects. So you get a very relevant  view to Woody Allen's career. Because of Stig Bjrkman's high  professionalism, and because of Woody Allen's conversation talent and open  mind. It never gets too intellectual either. In fact, it makes you want to  watch the Woody Allen movies you haven't had the opportunity to watch yet.  The only minus is that the book is some years old so that it does not  contain discussions on his recent very interesting films. But as it is an  unrejectable document on film history, &quot;Woody Allen On Woody  Allen&quot; does belong on any film friends' bookshelf!	1998-12-28
