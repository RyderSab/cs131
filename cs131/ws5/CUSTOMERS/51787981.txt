This is without a doubt the finest,most in depth biography of the Yankee Clipper.It does reveal a definite dark side but at the same time shows that he was only human and reacted to his overwhelming fame the best way he knew how.I don't look at this book as a hatchet job when you consider some of the low-life idols we have in America currently.He loved Marilyn more than life itself and would have done anything for her.He was possessive of her and jealous but because he was Joe Dimaggio it<br />gets documented.Many people look to their idols to be a God but the bottom line was he had flaws off the diamond,who doesn't.After reading this book,I still came away with one conclusion.JOE DIMAGGIO WAS THE GREATEST ALL-AROUND BALLPLAYER WHOEVER LIVED!!	2000-10-25

I Was Expecting big things from this book but came away disappointed with both the packaging and content of the book. The packaging because the  pictures were nothing exciting and the order seemed out of sync,like they  put this together quickly to meet some deadline.As for the content or  selection,it baffled me that Roger Clemens was on this team.In big  games,I'll go with Whitey Ford any day of the week.Apparently,the selection  was based less on performance and leadership in clutch situations than on  strikeouts and statistics.Also,people who picked this team have short  memories and attention spans because when you look at the whole century  instead of the 80s and 90s,you will find much better pitchers than Nolan  Ryan and Roger Clemens who despite the many strikeouts and good stats,never  led their teams like a Ford,Koufax,or Gibson.These guys knew how to win the  big one.I'm surprised Randy Johnson,another good stats man wasn't voted in  by the judges,12 yr olds.	2000-08-25

Why  communicate with each other when we have such ESSENTIAL devices like  e-mail,voice mail,etc.Why go bowling and do other community type  recreational activities when we have the internet to play around  with.Welcome to the new millenium!!	2000-08-22

I am stunned at some of the negative reviews about this well-written masterpiece.The author did a great job in his research and is only quoting some of Clinton's good buddies of the past. It is unfortunate that 50% of the country have had their head in the sand for the past 8 years and don't  want to read or hear about how sleazy their two icons are.Maybe that is why  our country although rich,has suffered from moral and ethical decay, over  these past 8 years.With people,especially the liberal media looking up to  these 2 ...,no wonder there is apathy among the mainstream regarding  politics and everything else.	2000-07-21

I enjoyed this great well-written book about the greatest pitcher of the  modern era.They certainly don't make them like Koufax anymore.There is no  one pitching today that can even come close to pitching like Koufax did in  the 60s.The only flaw in this other wise great book is the audacity of  comparing Koufax to Roger Clemens who never won a big pressure filled game  in his life.Sorry,but last year's mop up Game 4 win against Atlanta was a  series that was already decided but Showboat Roger got undue credit.Koufax  was in terrible pain but still pitched unbelievable ball to lead his team  to victory.I would love to see Roger do that.	2000-07-10

I was disappointed with this book because I felt  the author was unfair to my idol throughout the book.I adore people like Hillary and Rosie O'Donnell because they feel in their hearts what America is all about and the author  made it seem like Hillary is not always a saint.This is a shocking  revelation to me because in front of the cameras,which is all that  matters,Hillary understands the pain we Americans go through every day,but  the author did not do a good job expressing this.I don't know why the  author who should be an expert on the subject,did not emphasize what a  sincere,honest woman she is.I hate to think I've been fooled by the media  all these years.The author did have some good things to say about Hillary  but overall she could have been a little nicer.	1999-12-09
