She and Malingo, the freed geshrat slave of Kaspar Wolfswinkle, travel the Islands of Tazmagor, Yzil, Huffaker, Efreet, and many others while trying to evade the Criss-Cross Man. At Babilonium, Candy and Malingo are separated. Candy goes to the Twilight Palace and kidnapped by a strange boy named Letheo to Efreet and into the clutches of the Lord of Midnight. .Malingo is taken to Odom's Spire and made to travel the Sea in search of Candy, but he finds the crew of the Lud Limbo instead (along with Finnegan Hob). All of them go by glyph to rescue Candy, and then all of them are taken into the Hereafter by the waters of the sea, called upon by the House of Carrion. What other mysteries lay in the Abarat? Who will escape the Carrions? Will there be absolute Midnight? Find out in the books of the Abarat! <br /> I loved the ever-thickening plot of the second book in the Abarat series. Its mysteries, magic, and excitement keep you interested. I also loved the amazing illustrations on many of the 489 pages. The only thing I did not really like in this book was how it was set up. The story skipped around from one character to another a lot. That was a bit confusing. <br /> The books of the Abarat are similar to the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. They both have kids as main characters who are whisked away to another world. Readers interested in fantasy should read this book.     <br />        <br />	2005-09-29

Going <br /> <br />Troy Billing is a seventeen year old, 296 pounder. He is going to do suicide until he meets Curt Macrae. Troys dad thinks that Curt is drug addict. Soon Curt makes Troy his new drummer. Although Troy can't play the drums, so Curt has his friend teach him how to play. They have a gig in 5 weeks, and Troy has to learn how to play the drums. Curt is homeless and he stole some drugs and took so much that he got sick so Troy took him to the hospital. Troy told his dad that Curt stole some medication from the hospital. Troys dad says that curt can live with them as long as he stops stealing medication. Curt decides to leave the hospital for the gig but then he changed his mind because he thought that Troy turned on him again but he didn't. Troys dad tried escaping Curt to the gig so he can play. <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not like it when Troy wanted to do suicide just because he was fat. I did not like this because I thought what if other people tried to do that only because they were fat and picked on. I did like it when Curt saved Toy from doing suicide because the book would have really been boring if he did suicide. I didn't like it when I found out that Troys dad thought that Curt was a drug addict. I did not like that because he was judging Curt before he even knew him. I liked it when Troy went to his first concert because that inspired him to play the drums even more. I didn't like it when Curt had Troy skip school for drum lessons because I thought that he was ruining his education even though he gets good grades. I liked it when Troy's dad let Curt shower and eat some food. I liked that because Curt is homeless and has nowhere to shower and eat stuff. <br /> <br />  <br /> People who would like this book is someone who likes books that are when people make new friendsand that there friend is doing something that you can go to jail for, and its up to him to help his friend stop. Other books that are similar to this is aimee by Mary Beth Miller, Miracle Boys by Jaquline Woodson, The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton , and Stetson by S.L. Rottman.  <br />    <br /> <br />	2005-09-29

Matthias is recognized as a hero for \\"accidentally\\" saving a guards life. With all eyes on Matthias, is there anyway he can escape to save his friends lives? Matthias and a group of undercover kids form an escape plan, but will a group of kids be able to escape a place filled with their enemy, and will they escape in time to save his friend's lives? <br /> <br /> I thought this was a very well rounded book. It gave excellent details and gave u a very good visual picture. I thought the author did a good job with keeping you interested; she had many cliffhangers at the end of the chapters. She held onto the stories of the first five books and also added more to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> If you read the first five books, you will love this one. This book was always keeping me on my toes and it was even more thrilling and adventures than the last five. If you love adventurous, fiction books, this is the book for you! I defiantly recommending you to read the whole series instead of just one because with her books moving at the rate they do, you will never be able to keep up and follow along.   <br />	2005-09-29

This worst enemy is called the vampaneze (vampires gone bad) lord. But before Darren can stop the vampaneze he must first deal with every kid's worst nightmare ... school. There is another problem around this little town, the problem is that dead bodies are being found and no one knows who is killing them. Can Darren help his fellow vampires or will school hold him back? Read the book to find out. <br /> <br /> I liked how this writer described the characters in this book. The writer described one of the characters as if he did not want the true identity of the character to be announced. He gave hints of what the character looked like. I liked the writer of this book because he kept me guessing the whole way through the book. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who likes horror and vampires. There is a lot of fighting in this book, so if you don't like fighting don't read this book. This book is part of a series, so if you liked this book there is more in this series.          <br />	2005-09-29

This Ghost name is Rich, and he insists that Alexander must help him or he will haunt him in a way for the rest of his life.  Rich also starts to haunt the people around Alex. <br /> I thought that this was a pretty good book.  A reason that I liked it is, because it was always right there keeping me on edge convincing me to keep on reeding.  The main reason that I liked this book so much, is because it was about the Civil War, and I have always found books about wars to be quiet interesting. There was also a lot of action in this book. <br /> If you like books about action adventure and a ghost every now and then this is the book for you!  Gary Paulsen is a great writer, and I enjoy his books, I liked this book even more, so if you Like Gary Paulsen books you'll love this book. <br />	2005-09-28

I like this book because it is about this family that live in the middle of nowhere and they have to sons. The two boys get invited to the Hitler youth leaders. They are allowed to go, so they do. They are going through training camp and Robert was doing everything like he was supposed to. The next morning Robert gets awakened really early the next morning. He gets dressed and they tell him to go and get in the car. He gets in and then they go to this place that was back in the mountains. It was all of the leaders from other camps there and they had a meeting. They found out that they were going to be in war. You will have to read the book to find out the rest, because the fun is just begging.  <br /> <br /> I liked this book because it is adventurous and it has computation and it is so exiting that you just want to keep reading. The part when they are at war is the best part. It is also good because when someone gets shot he gives you all the details and what it would be like standing right there beside that person that got shot. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about this book was it didn't really tell much about the family or the boys. I also didn't like this book because when the war started it just talked about everybody dieing and what it was like. <br /> <br />  I think that outdoors people and adventuress people would like this book because that's were it is, is outside or on an adventure. <br /> <br /> People that are in to Blood and Glore and war type books will really like Soldier Boys. They would like it because it is about war and there is some blood and glore in it.  <br /> <br /> This book is similar to all of the Gary Paulson books because it is adventuress and it is also related to the other war books. <br />	2005-09-28

Suzy and King had a thing for each other but then Billy broke it up. There baseball coach for next year is Mr. Anderson the high school coach. He heard that Billy and King don't really get along with each other so he makes them spend one week together. He does that because he wants them to get along better so they don't fight on the team next year. If they don't get along they don't play. But before that happened Billy and Suzy did some things to get closer and closer. You will have to read to see what that is and see if Billy and King get along better. <br />  <br /> Some things that I liked were that the book was about baseball, and baseball is one of my favorite sports. I also liked that Billy and King had to send a week together because at some points it was pretty funny. I like that Billy and King were fighting between a girl because it was funny to see what they were going to do to get Suzy's attention. I didn't like it because some times I would lose track of what was going on. But other than that I really liked the book. <br /> <br /> I think that anyone that likes baseball and friends would like this book because it is mostly about baseball and friendship. I thought that it was a pretty good book because it was funny and it was about baseball. So if you like those things I would read this book.

Everyone in the town died. An organization monitoring Piedmont wants to find out what happened so they go to a secret government base called Wildfire. They start doing tests to see if they can find out what happened in Piedmont. They return to Piedmont and they find a man and a baby who is still alive. They use the baby and the man to find out why the Andromeda Strain didn't affect them. <br /> <br /> In this book I liked the beginning. It was fast paced and a lot of things happening. <br />I didn't like how the book was full of science terms. It made the book a bit hard to understand. The more you read the book the less action occurs. It was hard to determine whether this was a Sci-Fi or a mystery. <br /> <br /> I think someone who took science in as there major in college would like this book. It would probably make a lot more sense to them.  <br />	2005-09-28

Many hardships lie in the tunnel as sacrifices are made and the fighting continues in the War of Scars. Books full of twists as characters come back into the books, some to help and some for revenge.  <br /> For the most part I really liked this book. It was full of twist that I never saw coming. It had great detail and plenty of action to keep me reading. In some books the farther they go in the series the worst they get, even in the ninth book Darren Shan still finds a way to keep you tied to the books. Some things in the book were disappointing like how the book ended. It stopped all of a sudden in the middle of everything. Some of the parts in the book didn't make sense to the book. Some parts seemed to be just thrown in there to make the book longer.  <br /> Anybody who wants to escape reality into a book full of creatures of the night and full of action would love this book. Anyone who has ever read Buffy or Angel would enjoy this thriller. <br />  <br />	2005-09-28

Paul was going to be gone for one year but he promises he will come back.  Adrienne went home back to her normal life waiting for Paul to come back. <br /> I loved this book.  It is the best book I have ever read.  I liked how the Author, Nicholas Sparks, wrote the book so you would want to keep reading it.  He wrote each chapter so you would want to read the next to find out what would happen.  Another thing I liked about the book it could actually happen in real life.  This book is not a make-believe story.  Since this is such a good book there really is not anything that I didn't like about it.  <br /> I think that anyone who likes romance books would like Nights in Rodanthe.  Also anyone who likes any books by Nicholas Sparks would probably like this book also.  This book is a lot like the other books he wrote. <br />	2005-09-28

Did the message lead to true love and destiny or just a mistake? <br /> Some things I liked in this book were the characters, the way the book was good throughout the whole book, and the ending. I liked the characters because of their attitude and personality and how they seemed so different, but yet so perfect for each other. I liked the ending because it really added some emotion to the book. I also liked how just when you think you know what's going to happen, an unexpected twist throws you off. One thing I didn't like about the book was how some things were kept secret between Theresa and Garrett. <br /> I would recommend this book to any girl, teenage through adult, who is looking for a good love story.

I will have to say that there are some other books that I would rather read that this one. The main characters in the book Damage is Austin Reid, his girl friend which her name is Heather, and as you know since it is about football the teammates are also main characters. Austin is a normal type of guy. I think that he is a normal type of guy because he never gives himself much time to get ready before school is always a little behind. While all of this is happening he also has a younger sister. He does not like his younger sister because she is always complaining about what she has to wear to school. She tries to get by her mother with what she is wearing to school everyday.  She is trying to be like the preppy kind of kids in the school. What Austin really don't like about what happens in the morning before school is that he always has to be hearing his mother yelling at his sister. Later on in the story when he really finds out what has happen to his dad is that when Austin was young his dad died with cancer and he really didn't know him, and he also don't remember anything. Once Austin was back into the game he had to go to football practice every day after school. One day the hottest girl in the school was waiting by the bleachers and he asked her if she needed a ride home, and she said yes. He has always like Heather but he has never had enough nerve to go up to her and ask her out. On the way home he was kind of nervous because she has nice things lots of money and here he sits with an old beat up pick up truck his dad had when he was a little boy. When he got to her house he got out ran around the truck and he opened her door. That is when he asked her if she would go out with him. Well she said yes and he asked her if she was going to be doing something after the game. From now on they would go out after every game. You need to read the book to find the rest. <br /> <br /> Some of my likes of thebook is that it is about football. Football is one of my favorite sports. Some of my other likes of the book is that his younger sister shows animals at the fair and I also show animals at the fair. Some of my dislikes of the book is really nothing because I really liked the book. <br /> <br /> Some of the people that I think would like to read this book is people that love sports. This book also has some romantic scenes in it so if you like romantic books I think that the people that would like this book are mainly for sport fans. <br />	2005-09-28

One day, while she was going to a soccer practice, she finds herself in the part of town that she's never been in before.  She ended up running into a lady outside of her house that she knew little about.  The lady invited her into her house while she called a cab for her.  After she leaves, she finds out herself that she was now a suspect to a murder.  After getting so close to figuring out who killed that lady, she finds herself on the totally wrong track.  When she really gets close, she finds herself in a large amount of trouble. <br /> A few things that I disliked about this book, was how it jumped around to different subjects right after another.  There were very few things that I disliked about this book.  The thing that I liked most about this book, was how they made it so that there were many parts that just left you hanging, just wondering what was going to happen next.  I thought that it had so much detail to every part. <br /> Even though this book has a girl as the main character, I would recommend this book to any person to read this book.  For people who like reading mystery books or even murder books would like this one, since it is a murder and a mystery book combined.  I think that's what it makes it very interesting.  <br />	2005-09-28

Dance work-outs, making music videos, and rehearsing with top pop singer, Kayla, were all part of her new life. You'll have to read the book to find out if Wonder is able to pull through or if she will go back to her old, boring life. <br /> I really liked this book because it was about a girl who got the chance to become a singer. She was following her dream and that is a good example of what everyone should do. I didn't like how the beginning and the middle were great, and the ending wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  <br /> I think any girl who enjoys music would like this book. Also, if you want to take on a singing or dancing career, you may want to read it to see all of the advantages and disadvantages of the job.

In this book, a family struggles at the loss of their oldest daughter, Jazz.  Everyone that is, except for her sister Sunny, who never liked Jazz.  Then one day, Sunny, opens the mailbox and retrieves a letter that would forever change her life and the lives around her.  The letter was from her sister-her dead sister.  The letter told how Jazz had been out of town that very same weekend that her apartment complex had burned to the ground.  She went on to tell how she would be returning home that weekend, and she did.  However, when she arrived, everyone knew this wasn't their Jazz.  Not the Jazz they all knew and loved.  Was this girl a fake or was this girl really their Jazz? <br /> Some things I liked about Dead Girls Don't Write Letters, is how the book kept you guessing what was going to happen next.  Another thing I liked about this book was how instantly everyone could sense something was different about the girl that had come back into their lives after being dead for over a month.  I liked this because it made you get the feeling that this was a close family.  Some things I didn't like about the book was the ending.  The ending had very little detail and was somewhat confusing.   <br /> Some people who might like this book are people who like to read.  I thought this because if you don't like to read you aren't going to like this book.  This book is so good that you never want to put it down, so therefore, you have to like to read a lot because I could never put this book down. I always wanted to know what was going to come next and who this girl was that came into their lives as their sister.  Was she really their beloved Jazz, or was she someone else just trying to be Jazz?  You also might like this book if you like books that keep you guessing.  With this book, it kept me guessing with every turning page.  You might also like this book if you like a little bit of mystery.  I think this because this book has a lot of mystery with it when the girl arrives.  I haven't read any books by this author, nor, have I read any other books that were similar to this type of book.  It is a kind of book that I'm sure you'll enjoy!    <br />	2005-09-28

Tom thinks there's something up with Dr. Willner and he won't stop looking for the truth of the Pleasant Valley shootings.  <br /> <br /> <br />     I really liked this book because it was partially a mystery and a partially cruel type of book. Some of the parts of the book that I didn't like were the part when Dr. Willner took away all of the Central students privileges. I also didn't like it when Silas had to leave the book because he was a really good character in the book. But overall, I thought the book was one of the best books that I have ever read. <br /> <br /> <br />   I think the really emotional type of people would like this book. Also, I think that the people that enjoy reading about school life would like this book. <br />	2005-09-28

Then, one night, a trolloc raid hits the city and steals the horn and a dagger.  Rand, Perrin, Mat, an army, and an ogier named Loial set out on a quest to regain the horn.  During the journey, Rand, Perrin, and Mat learn more about themselves and who they were in past lives. <br /> I like that the book is always adding new events you would never have guessed would have happened.  This book is a great adventure.  You would also love the problems the characters go through.  They make you want to keep reading the book to find out how they are solved.  This book is very long, so it has a lot of problems.  I admit that in the beginning the book is slow at getting into detail, but the farther you get the better the story gets.  Learning more about who and what Rand is was very interesting.  I liked the book so much that I started the next book in the series once I finished it. <br /> I think anyone that is into adventure, magic, and the Middle Ages would eat this book up.  I think you would like this book and its series, The Wheel of Time, better than the Harry Potter series.  This is the second book in the series.   <br />	2005-09-28

Dorry has just moved to North view, she has no friends there and is always alone. One day while Dorry was eating lunch, a girl named Angela comes up and asks Dorry to come and sit by her and all her friends. Dorry does this and soon is always with this group, and they become friends. Later on, Dorry comes to find out that all her friends are in a religious group named The Fishers of Men. Dorry goes to the Fishers retreats, and then becomes a Fisher. She really likes this at first and tries hard to become a better Fisher, but then things start to get rough. The Fishers start aking more and more of Dorry and Dorry cannot do it. Will Dorry be able to leave the Fishers, or will she be stuck forever? <br /> I liked this book and do not regret reading this book. The reason I like this book is because it tells the story of a teenage girl trying to deal with her problems, and trying to do the right thing. One reason I did not like this book is because at times it would be really exciting, then at times it would be REALLY boring. Leaving Fishers did not have that much action in it either. But still I really liked the book. <br /> People that I think would like this book are people that like to read about teenage kids and the problems that they face. Also people that like religious books and books like that may like Leaving Fishers. If you like Margaret Peterson Haddix books you may like this book because it is kind of like the other books that she wrote, how a teenager is trying to deal with them.    <br />	2005-09-28

It is the fifth book in the series of Diary of A Teenaged Girl. Caitlin is a senior in college and was at a wedding for two of her good friend. After a while at the reception, Caitlin and her best friend Beanie were leaving when Josh Miller stopped them. Josh and Caitlin have a history together, and Caitlin has always liked him since high school. Josh asked Caitlin if she was busy that night, and she said no. Josh was driving somewhere that he told Caitlin was special, but Caitlin didn't know about it. He drove to the park and hopped out to open Caitlin's door.  They walked through the park until they came to a clearing by the lake. There, Caitlin saw a table lit with candles. They sat down and were served by some high school-aged guys from their church. Then josh went down on one knee, and popped a question. <br /> I really liked this book because it explains what is happening really well, and makes it so you understand what is going on. I also like this book because every time you start the next book in the series, it explains like some of the things that happened in the book before that so you know what is going on at the beginning. I don't really have any dislikes about the book because I thought it was pretty exciting and interesting throughout the whole thing.  <br /> I don't think people who like adventure books would like this. I also don't think guys would want to read this book because it is more of a girl book. <br />	2005-09-28

Seth doesn't have no friends yet so the next day he goes there he goes on a bike ride to a town right beside his town and sees a boy playing baseball with his dad.  Seth dad passed away when he was young.  When he says high to the people they asked Seth if he wants to play and Seth does play.  Everyday Seth goes there and playes baseball with his knew best friend Jimmy.  Baseball starts to be life for both of them to Jimmy moves away. Eventually, he moves back and both of them are good friends again and baseball is life again to the end of the story when a shocking accident happens after a party that someone goes to after they won a baseball game.  That ends the good relationship and now they can't play baseball together anymore. <br /> What I like about this book is there is always a different event happening or something you don't think will happen happens.  What I didn't like about this book is when you read about the baseball games they are long and get boring to read till the end of the game. <br /> I think people who like sports and especially baseball would like this book because it tells a good lesson for baseball people to learn.  This is also similar to other books that Carl Deuker has written.   <br />   <br />	2005-09-28

Dave had been going out with Courtney for a few years and decided to break up with her before he headed off to college.  Grant Superior started hanging out with Courtney and asking her to go places with him.  After Dave broke up with Courtney, she made a pledge to go her entire senior year without a boyfriend.  Grant kept coming in Truth or Dairy, the smoothie shop where Courtney works, but Courtney kept trying to ignore him.  Trying to stay out of trouble, Courtney decided to run for student council.  Instead of getting the vice principal spot, Courtney got the principal of student council spot because the principal was stealing money from the student council jar.  Will Courtney keep her pledge and not have a boyfriend her senior year? <br /> One thing I really like about this book was it was written like a journal, so I didn't have to read for a half hour to get to the end of a chapter.  One thing that got me hooked on this book was it was really funny.  Catherine Clark wrote this book to make it sound like a teenager wrote it. One thing I didn't like about this book is that at the end it just sort of leaves you hanging and doesn't tell you what happens.   <br /> I would recommend this book to girls from ages eleven through fourteen.  This book would be best for girls looking for a fast read about just about everything in life. <br />	2005-09-28

Keeping Frightful or any other falcon is illegal.  Sam is devastated.  Frightful did everything for him and now she is gone. <br /> Sam hasn't seen Alice for days.  He has no idea were she is or what she is doing.  Sam checks Alice's tree house.  There he finds a note on the ground.  The note is from Alice and it says that she is leaving.  Sam wonders where.  He goes to his friend Brando's cottage.  He tells Brando about Alice and how she left without telling him.  He asks Brando to help him find her and Frightful.  Together they map out where Alice might be going.  With the help of a compass left in a sandy marsh by Alice, they set out in search of her.  Throughout their journey they track Alice trying desperately to find her because of the danger she could get into.  Join Brando and Sam in their quest through upstate New York as they try to find Alice and Sam's falcon, Frightful. <br /> I liked a lot of things in this book like the clues that Alice left for Sam and Brando. These clues told where Alice was and made you think where she would be going next.  I like that Alice didn't tell Sam where she was going because it made the book more like a mystery.  You had to guess where she might go.  I like this book because it was an adventure and mystery book.  I disliked the book because Sam didn't want Frightful back at the end of the book.  It would have been more interesting if he had wanted Frightful back and not let her go free because the quest for Alice was also a quest to find Frightful.   <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and adventure books.  If you like action books, it would be good for you too.  Anyone who has read the first book in this series should read this book.   <br />	2005-09-28

They burn her out of her home and kills her animals, but when Lisa goes missing like the other women can Quinn find her and solve the case? Read the book to find out the exciting ending. <br /> <br />I really liked this book. It seemed that every time Lisa and Quinn got close to finding the killer would try to scare them or to get them off his back., but when the killer tried to kill Lisa I knew that he had gone to far and that no matter what the price Quinn, Lisa, Jack, Jennifer, Marcus, Kate, Stephan, and Rachel will stop at nothing to bring down the killer. I also liked the fact that during all this Quinn and Lisa had a past secret that they would not tell and through all they were trying to get the other to talk about it. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to a person that likes a good mystery and a little romance that hits pretty close to home for most of the characters. You need to read the other books in the O'Malley Series to understand all that is happening in the book.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-28

This was not going to be an easy task for the LBD, but with the help of some others, will the LBD pull this thing off? <br />This book is about three troublesome teenagers trying to fight their way to life. Adventurous, hysterical, and exciting I would have to recommend this book to teenage girl readers who are ready and up for anything. <br />The LBD consisting of three best friends, are going through their teenage years of life. There boyfriend tragedies, friendship troubles, family breakdowns, and bombing school work is just the thing that I can relate to.

He makes Ben take off all of his clothes, and go out in the desert with no food , water , or clothes.  He is hunted down by Madec.  Ben finally finds water in a cave.  He finds out that birds come in there every night, and  morning.  He uses a sling shot that he used to kill a bird.  He also used it to kill a lizard once.  Ben would eat them raw.  Ben finally caught  Madec and took him to the police office, but it doesn't work out how you would think.  You will have to read this book to see what happens to Ben.<br /><br />  I didn't like this book at the beginning, because it is kind of boring.  After the first couple of chapters it starts to get pretty exciting.  The last couple of chapters are very exciting.  You don't know what is going to happen, and when you think you do you are usually wrong because things come out when it seems like nothing could happen.<br /><br /> I would tell someone to read this book if they like action, or exciting books.	2005-09-28

This book is based upon football and Travis's second chance to get revenge against Jerico Grooms, who made the game winning tackle on the last play that made the Oil Camp Roughnecks finish with a 12-1 season overall. Once again, the Oil Camp Roughnecks and their rivals, the Pineview Pelicans, have forty-eight minutes to see which is the better team. Once again, Travis Cody has to prove to his team that he can block Jerico Grooms one-on-one for the whole game. This will be his last game if he doesn't get a scholarship to play football from a college. He has tons of scouts looking over his and Groom's shoulders, watching them all night. One wrong move and it could cost wither one the chance of a lifetime. This is his last chance to show the coaches that he is a Roughneck and to lead his team for the win of the state championship. <br /> There were many parts that I liked about this book, like the amount of action when in the games. I liked the amount of detail in every scene because I had a clearer picture of what everything looked like. I disliked how the book ends because all of a sudden the story ends and nothing else really happens that's exciting.  <br /> I recommend this book to any person who has ever played football or likes to watch it because it is a good book to read. This book is similar to books by Matt Christopher, but this book has more detail than his books.  <br />	2005-09-28

The book begins as Eragon recovers from a fierce battle against Durza, the evil Shade.  As Eragon rests in the hollow mountain Farthen Dur, he plans to travel to Ellesmera, the elven capital to complete his training as a Rider.  With the help of Farthen Dur's in habitants, (the rebellious Varden and the dwarves), he prepares to depart with Arya, the elf maiden of whom he rescued previously.  Upon arriving in Ellesmera, he is heartily welcomed and celebrated.  He begins training the next day, learning a deeper knowledge of the natural and magical world.  Meanwhile, across the forest of Du Weldenvarden, in the tiny village of Carvahall, war rages as the Ra'zac return to capture Roran, Eragon's cousin.  Roran decides to evacuate the town to Surda, a small rebel country south of Galbatorix's empire.  The Ra'zac decide to leave Carvahall in the heat of a battle, kidnapping Katrina, Roran's fiance. Still, Roran pushes on.   Eragon, who is nearing completion of his training, leaves Ellesmera when here, receives word of the Varden nearing war with the Empire.  Eragon and Saphira engage in battle against Galbatorix's men, where tables are turned, havoc spreads, and secrets are revealed!  <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Eldest!  For me, it redefined the phrase, \\"I can't put it down!\\"  I devoured all 600+ pages of it in three days!  Paolini writes in a style that evenly mixes all genres of reading, especially fantasy, action, mystery, and a dash of romance.  Eldest goes above and beyond its predecessor, Eragon.  It's a must-read! <br /> <br /> The characters of Eldest resemble The Lord of the Rings; therefore, The Lord of the Rings fans will devour it.  Because Eldest is a sequel, you MUST read Eragon first or you will fail to comprehend it!  I strongly recommend this book to fantasy and medieval fiction fans.  It has the wizard/warrior face to it that slides cleanly into the fantasy genre.  I also observed that Harry Potter fans enjoy this book a lot.  It is a definite must read. <br />	2005-09-28

They all thought that the pants were magic.  They were all going away for the summer for they decided to pass the pants around to remember each other.  Now that they are seventeen and going off to all different college's this will be their last summer together.  Bridget is not going to be there though because she is going to soccer camp to coach.

She doesn't know what to do. Tibby wants to be friends with this boy named Brian but he wants more than that.  Each person had their own problem and through the story they get even more! <br /> The thing that I really liked about the book is that it talked about problems that I can relate to.  I could really understand the book because I am about the same age as them. There was always something going on in the book and it never got boring.  In every chapter there was always a problem or something interesting to keep you reading. <br /> I think that girls would mainly like this book. Also if you liked The Diary of a Teenage Girl or The Princess Diaries books you would probably like this book. <br />	2005-09-28

Didi is cheating on Todd with Jake. Todd finds out and a lot of bad things happen to Jake. <br /> <br /> In this book was that Jake had a party every Friday night. I think that would be fun to have a party every Friday. Another thing I like about this book was it is about a nerd and he moves to another school to be popular. He joins the football and he doesn't even like the sport. Something I didn't like was that the book was told in Jake's friend Rick's point of view. <br /> <br /> Someone who would like this book would be someone who likes a book a bout sports.

Its so misleading because you can't tell which character is good or bad.  The main characters are Nina, Alia, Percy, and Matthias.  They are all illegal third children.  This book takes place in the future.  There was a famine so the dictator created a law so families could only legally have two kids each.  All children born after the second were hunted down and killed by the population police.  This is the third book in the series. <br /> Some of my dislikes of this book were that the first and second books characters were not mentioned very much throughout the book.  Also the book was too short.  I think that Margaret Peterson Haddix could have made the book longer. <br /> Some things that I liked were how the book made me think what if the government had that much power over the country.  I also like how the author deceived me and made me think some of the good guys were bad.  <br /> People who might like this book are people who like adventure books because this book is mainly about four kids trying to find a place and how they escaped form jail.  Another group of people that would like this book are the people who like books with kids as the main characters.  The illegal children are all between the ages of fourteen and one.

Follow John through these experiences and learn his interesting views on life in the book You Don't Know Me.<br /><br /> This was a pretty good book, but I've read better.  One thing that I liked was how the story was told.  It has a very unique style and the style makes John seem like a likable, smart guy.  One thing that I didn't like was that the book got boring at times, and rather exciting at others.  I also didn't like the things that John's step father did, but it was just part of the plot.

US	23949908	R1DZMAJI0KY9R9	0142500739	334029264	Soldier X	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Surviving a War	Go back sixty years ago, a time of a war and fighting. I want you to not think about the Americans but the German soldiers. Many were forced to go to the lines at the age of sixteen. Many of the soldiers hardly had any training. This is a story about a German soldier who fought for Germany. Originally he was from Russia but his family moved to Germany. He was forced to fight at the age of sixteen. During a battle his life changed. Before he knew it he was in a Russian hospital. No one knew he was a German. There at the hospital was a beautiful lady he fell in love with, Tamara. Fighting was getting closer to the hospital. People were forced to leave. Soldier X and Tamara were left behind to fend for themselves, to cooperate, and work together until the end of the war. <br /> I really liked the book. If you like war stories this is the book for you. It's like a survival and war story in one. What really amazed me was how the hospitals were run. Anyone who was able to help would help at the hospital. I felt like I was right beside Soldier X the whole story. There where no dull parts it seemed. I really enjoyed the book and learning about history. <br /> I recommend this book to someone who likes war or survival stories. This book was really neat. I haven't read anything close to it. You realize how though war is and what a person will do to survive. The details were amazing. To understand better of what I'm trying to say, read the book. I strongly recommend it.     <br /> <br />	2005-09-28
