I was very flattered, when - back in the early part of May, 2005 - GM Lev Alburt sent me a copy of his new book, and asked if I would consider writing a review for it. Naturally, the idea appealed to me, as I consider myself a better-than-average student of the opening. And before I proceed any further, it may help you to know that I am a Master, and that I make a great deal of my income from teaching chess on the Internet. (This is my short review, I will definitely post a longer - and much more detailed one - on my website.)<br /><br />I spent well over a month reading, going over and analyzing the lines in this book. I deeply \\"Fritzed\\" some of the lines - and I wound up taking about a week and basically analyzing everything from Chapter Five, and also recording the results of that work on my computer.<br /><br />Did I find any errors? Maybe a few. For example, in line A on page # 64, Black plays 19...Qc8. Fritz greatly prefers taking the Pawn on b3, but there are a number of reasons that the authors may not have covered this. A.) White definitely gets an attack after this move; B.) It is both complicated and risky;  C.) Since this book is aimed at the average player, the authors may have chosen not to delve into this. Also - on page 62, there is another oversight. After  8.f3?, Qb6!; our team of authors provide the following comment: \\"Black threatens ...Nxe4 and ...Qxb2. White does not have an adequate defense - for example: 9.Bb3, Nxe4!; 10.Nxe4, Bxd4; and Black wins a Pawn.\\" All this might be true, but 10.Nxe4? is a terrible move, ('??'); White has to play 10.Nd5!, with a fairly good game. Play could then continue: 10...Qa5+[]; 11.c3 Nc5; 12.Nxc6 dxc6; 13.Nxe7+ Kh8; 14.Nxc8 Raxc8; (Fritz confirms that this is Black's most solid move in this position.) 15.0-0. (\\"+/=\\") White is slightly better due to the two Bishops, the computer confirms that Black cannot play  ...Nxb3; anytime soon, as this releases the WR on a1. (Bobby Fischer reached this position as early as 1958!!!)  See the contest:  GM W. Watson - GM M. Chandler;  ICT / Lloyds Bank (Open) / London, ENG/UK; 1984. (All this was adequately covered in a book on the Accelerated Dragon - published a few years ago, written by IM's John Donaldson and IM J. Silman. There was also a good book on this opening by GM's P.H. Nielsen and C. Hansen, published in 1998, I believe.)<br /><br />This just goes to show that the openings are terribly complex, and that writing a book on the openings is probably the most difficult area of all of chess, at least in my opinion. However - do NOT let that deter from buying a chess book. I have found errors in nearly every book that I have examined in detail. If you wait for the perfect book ... you may not ever purchase another chess book again!!<br /><br />Back to the subject at hand. So what is the aim of this book? It is an attempt by our illustrious team of authors to try and provide you with as complete an opening repertoire as possible. (GM A. Soltis has written at least one book around this premise, which I am aware of.) Is this a worthwhile idea? You bet! The ideal situation would be for every student to have a custom-tailored opening system, chosen by his or her teacher, and based on the practical considerations of the playing style of the student in question. However ... this is not feasible in most cases. (I have heard the complaint - perhaps thousands of times:  # 1.) I live too far away from a city with a good chess teacher;  # 2.) Internet lessons are too expensive;  # 3.) The GM or Master in my area already has his quota of students, and is not looking to add to his workload!)<br /><br />I have - seemingly recently - reviewed another book of this kind: \\"The Chess Advantage in Black and White,\\" by IM Larry Kaufman. So comparisons between these two books are both inevitable and appropriate.<br /><br />Basically ... the authors are advising you to play the Accelerated Sicilian (Dragon) against the KP, and the Nimzo-Indian against the QP. \\"Are these sound opening systems?\\" you are entitled to ask. \\"Absolutely, and without question!\\" I would answer. I am sure that these are openings, if played properly, could succeed at ANY level!<br /><br />And now down to brass tacks - what separates this book from all the others in this field? There are literally dozens of reasons that I could provide, however I shall confine myself to just a few of the more pertinent ones.<br /><br /># 1.)  This complete opening system was designed by several of the best players and GM teachers in the country. (Between the two GM's, they have a number of U.S. Championships between them.)<br /><br /># 2.)  There are several diagrams on every pair of pages, making it possible to study this book without even using a chess board!<br /><br /># 3.)  You have both analysis diagrams, regular diagrams, and also diagrams in blue. The whole purpose of all of this is to help you remember the material!<br /><br /># 4.)  There are \\"Memory Markers\\" (tests) solutions, a table of the mainlines, (or outline of the variations); and summaries of material at the end of every chapter.<br /><br /># 5.)  There is a wealth of historical information - accompanied by photos.<br /><br /># 6.)  The last chapter covers ten deeply annotated games - showing the ideas of this book in action in actual games. (This is followed by a complete index of all the opening variations that this book covers.)<br /><br />The authors have gone to great pains to make this an exceptional and extraordinary book. They have even gone out on a limb and offered new moves ... OR COMPLETELY NEW LINES, in some cases! Practically every possibility has been covered; the material is often similar in ideas, another aspect which should make it easier to remember the material. (If I ever get to do a book, I would hope it is as good as this one.)<br /><br />I have a wide range of contacts, I asked a number of titled players (and well-known chess teachers); whether or not they had seen this book - or would they recommend it to their own students? Unlike the Kaufman book, the answer was a resounding \\"yes!\\"<br /><br />The editor also went to great lengths to create a new and different type of chess book, the organization and layout of this book is simply superb.<br /><br />Perhaps the only drawback that I could see to this volume is that the lines are often very detailed, although I would prefer too much analysis... to not enough!<br /><br />In closing, I highly recommend this book - I am sure that you will see it is quite different from most other books of this type. I look forward, with delicious anticipation, to the publication of the companion volume to this work!o-Indian against the QP. \\"Are these sound opening systems?\\" you are entitled to ask. \\"Absolutely, and without question!\\" I would answer.

I first received this book, {about six months ago}; as a present from a local chess-player ... I state this up front, only because I would NOT have purchased this book on my own. (A pity too, I would have missed out on a wonderful chess experience.) You should also know that I am a master and a \\"chess pro,\\" and that I make a great deal of my income from teaching chess - and also that I have a popular chess web-site as well.<br /><br />This book is an obvious attempt to emulate the great Irving Chernev's classic work, \\"Logical Chess, move-by-move.\\" (Which - by the way - is now available in a new and updated algebraic edition.)<br /><br />And before you read my review  -- please at least scan all the other reviews on this page. (This will give you a better feel for what I am about to say.)<br /><br />When I first got this book, I spent about 10-20 hours with it. The very first thing I did was to play over all the games on my favorite {small} wooden set ... this process was completed in a single afternoon.<br /><br />I also subjected one game to some pretty intense, in-depth analysis, and I did find a few - mostly minor - discrepancies when I turned on the harsh spotlight of Fritz 8.0. This is not surprising, given the complexities of the sport of Kings. However, it does show that even Mr. N. McDonald has at least a little room for overall improvement.<br /><br />I also sent out a questionnaire to a bunch of friends, students, etc. (Mainly via e-mail, although about ten or more went out via U.S.P.S.) I asked everyone to rate this book, and mainly to compare it to John Nunn's book, \\"Understanding Chess.\\"<br /><br />I then laid this book aside for quite some time. Then one day - almost by accident - a friend asked me to bring along a book to Sunday chess club, just in case there weren't very many people there to play. I did so ... and cannot say I ever made a better or more fortuitous choice in my whole life.<br /><br />The amount of fun I have had in going over these games ... simply cannot be translated to mere words. Sure, McDonald has written a really good chess book. But this should not be all that surprising for anyone who is familiar with his work. (I am - I own several of his other books.) But where he has completely exceeded himself - IS IN THE GAMES THAT HE SELECTED TO ANNOTATE!!!!!<br /><br />I don't have any clue at how he arrived at the final thirty games that he selected to for inclusion in this volume ... they are NOT games that I have seen annotated before!! He certainly did not rehash someone else's work {or web page}; tricks that many chess author's today are very guilty of. (It saves a little time; maybe some writers are not capable of being completely original anymore.)<br /><br />Would you like an example? I am so happy that you asked!<br /><br />The very first game in the book is a beautiful crush by Anatoly Karpov over Vicktor Korchnoi from a World Championship Match that was played in 1978. (The game examined is NOT the one that most authors usually examine from that - now classic - chessic confrontation.) The notes are simple, lucid and very poignant. Even as a master, I felt that I both enjoyed the game, and that I learned something in the process.<br /><br />The second game of the book was a wonderfully explained POSITIONAL crush, GM Robert Huebner vs. GM Lajos Portisch; from Brussels, 1986. (I liked this game so much that I featured the key part of it in one of my monthly columns for another web-site.) Without question, this was gripping chess drama ... from the first move to the last. All the players present at the club were of varying strength. (From Master, to Expert, to Class \\"A\\" ... all the way down to two players who are virtually beginners.) Everyone present felt that they understood the entire game; many times all I simply did was to read GM McDonald's excellent notes aloud.<br /><br />I could give you a \\"blow-by-blow\\" for every game in the book, but that would be engaging in overkill. Suffice itto say that I stand in awe of the games selected by this author; they each convey a specific chess idea. (In grand manner, I might add.)<br /><br />Another aspect of the games ... is that they are so wonderful, that they have instantly become one of my favorite games for that player! Nunn's crush of A. Sokolov was so entertaining, that I had to \\"own\\" this game, deeply annotate it and post it on my web-site. (As I write this, that effort is around 2-3 hours from being completed.) Judit Polgar's enchanting miniature victory, (over A. Shirov); has become my favorite game for this player. (I have already begun the process of deeply annotating this game ... for eventual inclusion on my website.)  GM A. Shirov's amazing win over GM Evgeny Bareev; (Game Ten - A French Defense from Wijk aan Zee, 2003.); is so spell-binding and so full of shocking and surprising moves - it not only [now] my favorite Shirov game ... I have decided that I must commit the whole of it to memory! I could rattle on for days here, but I trust you get the point!!!<br /><br />The organization - by opening - is definitely a plus, especially if you are trying to learn a specific opening system. (This is the best way to learn a new opening.)<br /><br />Now back to my survey - many people responded, around 20-30 in the desired, target group ... from beginner to around 1600, USCF. ALL of the people who wrote or contacted me ... had nothing but good things to say about McDonald's effort here. Only one person preferred GM Nunn's work over GM McDonald's, calling this book, \\"overly simplistic.\\" One young lad - who lives in the state of Delaware - stated that this work, \\"Is easily the best and most instructive chess book that I have ever read!\\" (He says that he has read 50-100 books already.)  I would go one further, and call it \\"The Book of The Year for 2004,\\" especially if you are rated under 1800!!<br /><br />In closing, I highly recommend this book. It is  - without question - one of the best, most instructive and most fun chess works to have come down the pipe in about fifty years!!

US	50708211	R2SURILRUZZ0XF	1857441664	795632042	Modern Chess Miniatures	Books	4	3	3	N	N	One of my favorite books on miniatures	(June 2005) This book is already ten years old ... and I have owned it for a very long time.<br /><br />Read the other reviews here, they all say that this is a good book. McDonald was a very young writer when he wrote this, he spent a great deal of time on this volume, and it is apparent from the first time that you pick this book up.<br /><br />Most authors just splash the game across the page with broad, vivid strokes, often they are content to let the moves speak for themselves. Not so for Mr. Neil McDonald, his love of chess is evident - he spends time telling you how the game was played, how the combination could have been improved - in short, he gives you most of the information and detail that other (more experienced?) authors could not be bothered with.<br /><br />Why should you study miniatures? Well ... there are a lot of good answers to this question.<br /><br /># 1.)  You quickly learn tactics.<br /><br /># 2.)  You learn how to punish your opponent's mistakes, especially in the early part of a chess game.<br /><br /># 3.)  If you study enough games of this type, it will definitely improve your overall feel for the game.<br /><br /># 4.)  Just because it is fun!!!<br /><br />I love this book, when I used to work nights at a local radio station, I studied this book for around an hour every single night. I really like McDonald's work ... he has written enough books now to show that he is a good author - and that he is here to stay.<br /><br />I did not give this book five stars ... for reasons that have nothing to do with chess. ---> The diagrams are not 100%, the print is fading, and the pages are rapidly yellowing. ALSO - the binding has come apart on two of these books ... but I will readily admit that intense wear could have been the cause.  (This is like my third or fourth copy of this book.) But I honestly do not think these are serious issues, many of you may not even notice these flaws.<br /><br />I wholly endorse this book - the quality of the writing is well above the standard most authors normally set for a book of this type. McDonald - by turns - instructs, delights and amazes his readers. (Recommended.)e writing is well above the standard most authors normally set for a book of this type.

Sawaski<br /><br />Recently, I was asked (by the author) to review this book. But before I do, I would like to share something with you.<br /><br />In the 'old days'  ...  getting a book published by a major company was a big event. But it was also very hard to do. Nowadays, anyone can publish a book, especially if they are willing to invest a few hundred dollars. The 'pro' side of the coin is that many more authors are getting books published ... people who might not have been able to do so, otherwise. The downside of this turn of events is that books are less polished than they generally used to be.<br /><br />In the second paragraph of the first page, we find the sentence, \\"Flint donned the best player in the state for under 18 years of age,\\" which appears to be a badly misused word. According to the dictionary, the word \\"don\\" means to put on an article of clothing. You don a cap, or a sweater, not a chess-player. (You might \\"boast the best player in the state,\\" but not don one.) I was unsure if this was completely correct, so I took the book to a few experts, one is a lady who teaches English at the local Junior College. (I used to teach her son chess.) The general agreement is that this was a word that was not used correctly.<br /><br />Further, I found many sentences that were constructed incorrectly; I e-mailed several passages of the text to an English Professor (at a University) in Alabama. He agreed that all of these sentences were ... \\"not according to Doyle,\\" as he put it. There were many more examples, but that would be beating a dead horse. Also - on page 65 - the word \\"intact\\" is given as two separate words. (There are not any mis-spelled words that I could find, and this is because just about any good {word-processing} program has an efficient tool for checking the spelling of any document.)<br /><br />But what carries any novel is ultimately the STORY! Here, I would give the story a 7.5 on a scale of one-to-ten. It makes a good and interesting read, although the plot device has been used before. (If you have seen any martial arts movie on TV, you have been exposed to this literary algorithm before.) Chess players will definitely enjoy the story; it is all about chess - with few (if any) technical inaccuracies. While not in the category of say, \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer,\\" this was still a pretty darn good book.<br /><br />This book is an engrossing read; I doubt any chess player would be terribly disappointed by it. It is my hopes that it is picked up by a major publishing house, polished by a top-notch editor, and offered to the public again. (Recommended.)to-ten.

The Veresov, by GM Nigel Davies<br /><br />Firstly, you should know that I am a Life-Master who makes a living - primarily - by teaching chess. I also should apologize to the student who purchased this book for me over a year ago, with the only condition that I review it here.<br /><br />Before I proceed with my book review, I want to tell you a story. Some well-known player and author came out with a book. Play the 'X-factor' attack. He really hyped this book pretty well, (a couple of the illustrative wins, that were very short and flashy - but also were really bad chess); within 5-10 years, dozens of club players all over the country were playing this opening. Never mind that you commit positional suicide with this opening, or that your end-game was very, very bad. No ... all that mattered was that you play this particular opening. (And the author of the aforementioned book makes a buck or two.) An IM even played this opening against me at a New York Open a few years back, the result was a clean win for yours truly - in fewer than 40 moves.<br /><br />The moral of the story? Don't play an opening system if it is positionally unsound, or if your chances in an ending ... ANY endgame ... are very poor! \\"Tis better to play something solid and slowly climb that hill, than to play something shoddy, (aiming for a quick win); - and get killed!\\"<br /><br />I am not a fan of this particular opening, {The Veresov's} very simply put; I have never really played these lines, (as White). They are simply not my cup of tea! Does this mean that this system is unsound? Certainly not!! A close scrutiny of the games inside reveals that is a solid line, tried even by the well-known, respected GM. (But only used sparingly or on occasion.)<br /><br />The book is from \\"Everyman Chess.\\" They certainly have a more than adequate staff ... editors, proof-readers, etc. They have a great deal of experience and know how to put out a good, high-quality chess book. (Neat design, good binding, well organized, and an average of two diagrams per page.)<br /><br />GM Nigel Davies has certainly done his homework here. I have had this book for some time, I have 'Fritzed' dozens of the lines ... I have yet to discover one obvious or glaring error in analysis. (I cannot say this about most other chess books that I have reviewed!)<br /><br />The author succinctly puts forth the main lines and his analysis. There is even a nice outline and a recommendation of the correct study plan in the introduction. Is this book perfect? Probably not, few chess books are. Do I recommend this one? The answer is a resounding, \\"Yes!\\" (But with a few conditions.)<br /><br />1. I would not recommend this book to an extremely low-rated player ... or a near beginner, it would simply be too difficult for a player with limited experience to handle.<br /><br />2. This would be a VERY good idea for a \\"one-opening\\" repertoire ... for a player in the 1400 - 2000 range. (Who does not mind QP openings.)<br /><br />3. Postal players - who play either side of these lines - will definitely want to get this book.<br /><br />4. Once more, we have far too much emphasis on memory, and not enough discussion of general formations and overall plans and strategies. (A failing common to MANY opening books.)<br /><br />5. A player who is lazy or does not enjoy spending time studying the opening will probably not get much out of this book. In the end, they will wind up playing this opening in a tournament ... not knowing a key line, and get killed. (The tactics are enormous here!)<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty good book. It is definitely better than average, and if studied properly, the average tournament player will score quite a few wins with this opening. (I also advise having a back-up opening, like the Colle, ready. This is in case you get blown out of the water at a tournament by a certain line, and there is not enough time before the next round to analyze the new idea in depth, and try to fix theproblem.) Recommended.alyze the new idea in depth, and try to fix the problem.) Recommended.  <br />	2005-05-23

Nimzovich helped author the \\"hyper-modern\\" movement. He was one of the strongest players of his day, second only to Alekhine. And his writings have now helped shaped generations of chess players.<br /><br />It is said that Petrosian - when he was young - was greatly shaped and influenced by the ideas of Aron Nimzovich. GM Bent Larsen felt that \\"My System\\" was the most influential book that he had ever read. I could go on and on, but hopefully you get the idea. (I also feel that Nimzovich was a powerful force in my development as a chess player.)<br /><br />Perhaps the ONLY criticism that I could offer of this book is that the openings look a little dated, a player who wants to see ONLY modern games should skip this one. But this book is a bargain, and if you want to study some great chess, and {also} be influenced by the writings of Nimzovich, then grab it!	2005-04-17

I was honored a few months ago when Igor Khmelnitsky sent me an e-mail and asked me to review his new book. (Chess Exam)  I said yes and the new book arrived shortly thereafter. (You should also know that I am a LIFE-Master, and make a living teaching chess on the Internet.)<br /><br />You should also know that I do not consider these books to be all that valuable, and that I was prejudiced from the very start against the idea. This is not the author's fault; I have probably been the victim of too many BAD books of this type! (Many appear to be hastily thrown together over a very short amount of time ... they will not help your game much, despite the many promises that are made to you before you buy the book.)<br /><br />Here the author is not some pretender or 'chess wannabe' ... who has no real chess credentials at all. He is a solid IM: who has won many events; has participated in several U.S. Championship tournaments; has a great many students who deeply respect him; and is the product of the highly vaunted \\"Soviet School of Chess.\\"<br /><br />My initial impression of this carefully crafted book was very favorable; the first problem is an endgame that could arise at nearly any level.

He enjoyed the book tremendously, although he pointed out that there were quite a few grammatical errors ... this {self-published} book could have benefited from having a chess editor with the proper credentials and background.<br /><br />I found several problems with the book, a few of the variations are probably questionable. Also - the educational value of the book could have been greatly increased by having more instruction and explanations in the analysis of the various problems. For example, I sent problem # 87 out to about 50 Internet contacts. Of the 20-30 individuals that responded, all of them said that they were unable to solve this problem. (Unless they cheated, and used a computer program.) The correct solution is: 1.Na4!!!, b5xa4;  2.Rf4!!, PxN; (e5xf4) 3.g3xf4! Now Black is helpless against the threat of Rg1+. The most common defense offered by my students - which Khmelnitsky does NOT cover - is 3...Kh8. This is easily refuted by 4.QxP/f6+, Kg8 (the only legal move); 5.Rg1 mate. Now comes the interesting part. How do you break down Black's defenses after the much superior try of 3...Ne6!; here? (Khmelnitsky does NOT cover this at all, either! And one local student, and several Internet students did not solve this problem, even after five - or more - minutes of thought.)<br /><br />Another problem is that the Russians must be sitting on some secret files somewhere ... if they are, they need to publish them! The above problem is &lt;supposedly> based on the game: C.H.O.D. Alexander - Frank J. Marshall; Cambridge, ENG; 1928. (I think I have seen this game in another book somewhere else.) All this is fine and good - except for the fact that I could not find this game in any database. (I usually advise my students - if they are interested enough - to look up a game and study it. This usually helps fix the problem firmly in their head.)<br /><br />By now you might be getting the impression that I did NOT like this book ... and, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth!!! I LOVED this book, despite a few mostly minor flaws, it is the ONLY book of this genre that has even slightly interested me. My students also LOVED this book, and found its educational benefit to be very great! It gets my HIGHEST rating for a problem/self-test book, and I would advise ALL of my students to purchase this book ... and study it carefully!<br /><br />Two other books that I would advise studying along with this book would be:<br /><br /># 1.)  \\"Turning Advantage Into Victory in Chess,\\" by GM Andrew Soltis. and<br /><br /># 2.)  \\"Chess: The Art of Logical Thinking,\\" (from the first move to the last); by GM Neil McDonald.gical Thinking,\\" (from the first move to the last); by GM Neil McDonald.  <br />	2005-04-12

A friend recently purchased this book for me as a birthday present. (Thanks Steve!) The only requirement was that I review it at the earliest possible opportunity.<br /><br />At first, I thought, &lt;&lt; Oh no, if I have to read one more book aimed at the \\"average player,\\"  I think that I will probably throw up!! >><br /><br />(Of course, I am exaggerating here a little bit, but you should get the general idea.)<br /><br />But I was pleasantly surprised. I have had this book almost a month now. I have studied many of the examples myself. There were many enjoyable hours spent in analysis, both without and with the computer. I also have gone over the examples with both local friends and students, and also a few contacts on the Internet. The feedback here has been overwhelmingly positive. (Several students felt that the most important aspect of the book was the simple and plain English that the author uses to convey his ideas.)<br /><br />What is this book all about? Well, obviously it is one that is designed to help the average player improve. But EXACTLY how is the author going to try and reach this goal? Every book -- of this genre -- has a premise, or a core idea. I always try to discover what this is as soon as possible. Then I try to see if the author has done his homework. I think that I can confidently say that this is a great little book by Soltis, and he has indeed done some real work here. I can also say that it is one that I think almost everyone could learn a little something from. The goal here is to learn some CHESS TECHNIQUE.<br /><br />I will try to summarize what the author says about this subject. \\"Technique,\\" with a capital \\"T\\" is what most GM's have. And it is something that the average player desperately wants ... but has no idea how to gain this crucial knowledge. On page 10, he goes on to say that there are many myths about technique ... like the one that if you play chess long enough, you will simply learn it by osmosis. Or that it is some special skill that you are born with, either you have it or you don't. Or how that some people feel technique ONLY comes from sitting at a Master's elbow for many, many years, all the while paying for lessons. And all of these ideas are completely wrong!<br /><br />Now I will simply quote the author:  &lt;&lt; Actually, what we call Technique, with a big \\"T\\" is just a collection of \\"little-t\\" things -- such as knowing when and how to trade, how to restrict the enemy pieces, how to anticipate or defuse an opponent's counterplay, how to visualize a winning plan, how to break into a fortress, and so on. The \\"little t\\" techniques can be learned just as readily as the first dozen moves of the Caro-Kann Defense. >> (Page 11.)<br /><br />He goes on to say that computers are very poor technicians, (which is still mostly true); but he seems to dismiss the giant strides that the boxes have made in the last few years.<br /><br />Well, here is a book that gets my whole-hearted endorsement. It is a tremendous process, you will learn a lot of general chess knowledge, you will practice both you analytical and evaluation skills, I could go on and on, but by now you should get the idea.<br /><br />I found a few mistakes, but nothing that really changes any of my earlier statements. Everything in this book is still stuff that the average player must learn ... especially if he (or she) aspires to complete mastery of the field. (In the very first example, Soltis misses 2.f3+! This move appears meaningless until you get about 7 moves down the road. Black will be forced into a very unusual type of position where just about any move loses. This condition is known as \\"Zugzwang\\" in chess terminology. Basically it means that - while you might have a reasonable position - any move that you make will allow your opponent to break down your position.) This also confirms what Soltis personally told me a few years back, that he does NOT use a computer, {chess program} to study chess. Today, this is almost impossible; the computer will always find a move that the human might miss.<br /><br />The organization of the book was something I did not necessarily agree with. In a few of the chapters, an ending is followed by an extremely complicated middle-game position. (See Chapter Eight.) This often leaves my head spinning; however some students seem to enjoy the change of pace. In fact, few students enjoy a whole afternoon devoted to the (seemingly esoteric) study of R+P endings, very often you have to mix the material up ... or the average player gets bored.<br /><br />All in all, an outstanding book, that gets my highest rating and fullest endorsement. If you study this book carefully, you are bound to improve. And if you are not careful, you might even have some fun in the process!hess.

The focus of this book is the one and only Bobby Fischer, many consider this player be simply the greatest chess master who ever lived. And there have not been many good books on this player recently - GM Andy Soltis's book, (\\"B.F. Rediscovered\\"); being one happy exception.<br /><br />This eagerly anticipated book is well crafted, a high-quality volume designed for many years of enjoyment. Every fan of either Garry or Fischer will definitely want to reserve a spot for this work on their favorite bookshelf. (And Garry has corrected earlier mistakes; this effort actually has several indexes and a bibliography.)<br /><br />This volume is really two books in one. The first part of this work is devoted to three players: Sammy Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf, and Bent Larsen. (Three of the greatest non-Soviet players of the last 100 years.) This part of the book looks to be excellent, I am sure that there are many, many, many hours of enjoyment to be had in this section.<br /><br />However, I purchased this volume for the look at Fischer - this is the part that holds my attention and fascination. Fast forward to Chapter Two on, 'Robert, the Eleventh.'<br /><br />This section begins with a rather startling revelation - I had heard rumors of this before, but never anything resembling actual confirmation. There is a fairly decent biography; it details Bobby's first steps with chess poignantly and accurately. The first game, (# 50); is a rather lukewarm analysis of one of Fischer's most famous games. (Vs. Donald Byrne, New York; 1956. \\"The Game of The Century.\\")  {See my web page for a more complete analysis of this game.}<br /><br />Another thing you should understand is that I have been studying chess my whole life, I grew up with the book, \\"My Sixty Memorable Games.\\" I am intimately familiar with most of these games, many I have studied so often that they feel like old friends to me. And they are also semi-sacred to me, without a study of these great contests, I am sure I would have never become a Master myself. This is why I object to this &lt;Modern School> of annotating. (Anytime a minuscule improvement is found, this gives the writer license to decorate time-honored chess moves with undeserved question marks.) As in previous volumes, Kasparov shows a heavy, ham-handedness in his annotations. He virtually suffocates and degrades these games with all kinds of appellations to the various moves. Consider game # 52, page # 222. (Versus Larsen, 1958 - a famous Dragon. This game was beautifully annotated by Fischer himself.) For example, he gives White's 15th move a dubious mark. (?!) I think here it is more of a question of style, Fischer would almost never willingly block in his own Bishops. In fact, one wonders if Garry's own ego would ever allow him to be truly objective. He seems determined to criticize and denounce Bobby Fischer, (and his play) ... as if in an effort to cement his own place in chess history.<br /><br />There are other things about this book that I object to as well. After Fischer's famous contest with Panno, (Game # 80, page # 346); Garry just could not resist sticking in one of his own games. Like a little kid who craves recognition for his work - \\"See? Look what I did?\\" This is SUPPOSED to be a book about Bobby Fischer! (Lack of focus. Again!)<br /><br />I decided to take one game in this book, and subject every move to the microscope of the computer. (Vs. B. Spassky, 1972. # 103, page # 438) I was hoping to find zero errors, but alas this was not the case. I found mistakes that ranged from the very minor, to the more moderate type, and at least one that must go into the, \\"My Goodness!! What happened there?\\" category. (I will save the details for the next update of my web page on this very famous game.) Kasparov certainly recognizes this game's importance, just the fact that he spends like seven pages scrutinizing it is significant; as well as the 8-10 exclams that he uses to decorate the various moves in this titanic clash. IF you want a different perspective on this game, see GM Yasser Seirawan's excellent book, \\"Winning Chess Brilliancies.\\"<br /><br />I must also take issue with the statement made after Black's fourteenth move, 14...a6. He quotes a famous game - Timman vs. Geller, Hilversum, NED; 1973. Then he states that this game: \\"Practically speaking, put the 8.cxd5 variation out of use.\\" This is such a silly, foolish and stupid statement; I feel obligated to take Mr. Kasparov to task on this one.<br /><br />I have practically every reference book ever printed in English, and I have 1-2 dozen books on the Queen's Gambit Declined alone. The latest book on this opening calls 8.cxd5, {still} \\"the time-honored main line.\\" Dozens of players still use this move on a regular basis. [See the game: GM S. Mamedyarov (2657) - GM S. Lputian (2634); / FIDE WCh, KO / Tripoli, LBA; (Round 2.4), 22,06,2004.]  If this line isn't being used anymore, why are these two top players ... still fooling around with it? And the real punch-line is that the column in MCO-14 on 8.cxd5, is based on the following encounter: IM Luc Winants - GM Garry Kasparov; Brussels, 1987!!!<br /><br />This book is definitely better - especially in terms of the quality of analysis - than many of the previous efforts, but it is far from perfect. The editorial/product description calls this book: \\"a must for all serious chess players.\\" (I would definitely not go that far!) However, it is fair to say that this is a serious chess book, any player who is serious about improving his game or is interested in the history of chess -  would benefit from a close study of the historic chess battles in this volume. But it falls far short of Garry's previous work in books like, \\"The Test of Time.\\" (Recommended.)lams that he uses to decorate the various moves in this titanic clash.

This is my review of Garry's new book, please see my reviews of the earlier volumes. (This is my short review, I may post a longer one on my web site.)<br /><br />Garry Kasparov is one of the greatest players who ever lived, and earlier efforts have also demonstrated that he can be a good author - if he applies himself. This volume has also received much attention in the press, some chess websites have treated these volumes as if they were the greatest thing to ever happen to the chess world.<br /><br />This volume is part three of a series of books. It focuses primarily on two {former} World Champions, Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky. (The introduction informs us that the authors will also be looking at the contemporaries of these two players: Gligoric, Polugayevsky, Portisch and Stein.)<br /><br />In a way, this book is important - I have a fairly large chess library, so I naturally have many books on both of these players. However, current books on Petrosian are hard to find, many are out of print and impossible to obtain.<br /><br />Petrosian is well known for his defensive capabilities, but some of the other qualities of his play are not understood. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Petrosian might have been the best blitz player in the world. He had excellent tactics, an incredible grasp of the opening, and an uncanny knack for finding the weakest part of an opponent's position. And on the days when he felt like exerting himself, he could be one of the games deepest thinkers. (See his victory over Unzicker at Hamburg, Germany; 1960. White marches his King all the way across the board, a triumph of chess strategy, with an incredibly beautiful finish. This volume also fails to examine this contest ... which is a terrible shame.)<br /><br />Spassky is one of the greatest players who ever lived, his ability and all-round dynamic approach to the game has never been fully appreciated by most amateurs. This volume is filled with his beautiful victories ... although a few of his greatest games are missing from this particular volume.<br /><br />Now down to brass tacks. The authors have fewer games in here that do not concern the principal players of the volume, so the lack of focus has improved. (Although there are still games that seemingly don't belong in here. Garry's inclusion of a loss to Petrosian in 1979 has no real bearing on the life of this great player. Kasparov almost appears to be looking for some moral justification for his defeat ... which is really sad.)<br /><br />There are still quite a few historical inaccuracies, and while the authors have improved in this area, the pundits on the Internet clearly proved they have not completely solved this problem, either.<br /><br />This volume was supposed to be of a much higher standard in terms of analysis, a U.S. representative of the publisher personally assured me of this, via a USPS letter. However, I see no real change in the overall level of the analysis, I spotted many errors just casually playing through the book - without even putting them on the PC and running them by the computer's wizardry.<br /><br />I decided - after much thought and perusal - to only deeply analyze one game in this volume, in this way I could complete my review in a timely manner. {I eventually plan to publish my complete analysis on my web site.}<br /><br />The game that I chose was L. Stein - S. Furman; from the 37th URS Championships, 1969. (Game # 68, page # 253 - of the English edition.) On first blush, the analysis appears to be very detailed and well done. However upon deeper inspection the authors only updated previous analysis ... and did not do a very good job. I found somewhere between 15-20 errors, and these range from only minor all the way up to jaw-dropping blunders and oversights. Space would not allow a comprehensive review or analysis here, I will confine myself to just a few examples to make a point.<br /><br />The computer likes the move 14...Qb6; however the authors quote a game where this was played and Black lost horribly. (Smirin - Gelfand; Sverdlovsk; 1987.) The authors make no comment on the moves of this game, but 17...Kc8?? was a terrible mistake, any analysis engine will confirm that taking with the Bishop was forced.<br /><br />Nor is this the only failure by the annotators, I will not dabble with many of the smaller mistakes and oversights, but save those for my web page. 17.dxc6 appears to be a routine re-capture, but White had 17.Qe8+!! winning very rapidly. (The authors make absolutely no comment at all at this point.) Nor is this the only time that I found an improvement, I found at least five major improvements over the game or analysis ... many of these required no real work, only some close scrutiny with an analysis engine.<br /><br />The authors do analyze possibilities after White's 30th move ... but come to the wrong conclusion. And there is some confusion over what move Black actually played on his 37th move. One book - and several Internet sources - give the move of  \\"37...K-N5.\\" (...King to the b4-square.) And while the majority of other sources give 37...Kb5; as Kasparov and company do here; this still does not entirely resolve the problem. If Black's 37th move is incorrect, then the authors failed to do basic move verification. And if the 37th move of ...Kb5 is what was actually played in the game - as given by MGP - this still does not explain why the authors failed to comment on Black's 38th move ... which was basically a DOUBLE-QUESTION mark blunder ... which White failed to notice, (or capitalize on).<br /><br />I could go on and on ... but I trust by now you get the point. If you are just an average player looking for some interesting games, decently annotated; then you should buy this book. However, if you are looking for high-quality analysis of the truest caliber, then this volume does not get a passing grade.he move 14...Qb6; however the authors quote a game where this was played and Black lost horribly.

At over 600 pages, I don't think that the word, \\"massive\\" is out of place.<br /><br />Before you go any further ... if you are seriously considering purchasing this book ... you definitely should go to IM J. Silman's web site and read IM Anthony Saidy's book review. It is detailed, thorough, and very comprehensive.<br /><br />Here is my two cents worth, and I will try to be as brief as possible.<br /><br />GM R. Fine wrote the original book in about 4-6 months, the world's endgame experts did not believe that this feat could be accomplished in ten years!!! (A truly Herculean feat - by one of the greatest American players and writers, ever!) Fine managed this trick without computers, databases, etc. Naturally many errors were eventually discovered.<br /><br />Benko and Hochberg took it upon themselves to update this work; it was sadly in need of a revision. Not only to correct all the mistakes, but to change the book to from the old - now completely outdated E.S.D.N. - to the more modern algebraic notation.<br /><br />I agree with Saidy, this work is a step in the right direction ... but - - -<br /><br />A few of my complaints are:<br /><br />1. I found dozens of errors, despite the fact that the authors promised us a book that was meticulously checked by computers and the great Pal Benko. (My current volume already has dozens of corrections and notes in the margins, and about 50-to-75 bookmarks for places that I want to go back and analyze even further - sometime in the future.)<br /><br />2. Many times, important endgames from the period since this book was originally written, (post-1941); have been completely ignored.<br /><br />3. Many basic reference works, like \\"The Encyclopedia of Chess Endings,\\" (by the same guys who print the INFORMANTS); were obviously not even consulted;  many endings could have been updated or corrected simply by a careful review of these books.<br /><br />4. Many endgames have 'dual' solutions. These have been completely ignored.<br /><br />5. The current authors did not attempt to explain the basic ideas of many of the newer examples that were added, Fine often went to great lengths to do this.<br /><br />6. Benko's additions/replacements of his own bizarre problems often set my teeth on edge. Fine's original volume only had positions that were VERY practical or were culled from actual games. Benko's weird additions look out of place in this book; I much prefer many of the original positions - even with their many mistakes.<br /><br />Having said all this, you might think I hated this book, but I don't. I give it four stars and a HIGH recommendation. ANY player who considers themselves a serious student of the game - regardless of their rating - must purchase this book. ALL correspondence players will find this volume a true God-send when trying to analyze or learn a difficult ending.<br /><br />Let us just hope that the next set of authors that take a whack at this - start from scratch ... and are capable of using a computer and have the necessary reference books on hand.

Thanks to a recent gift from two of my Internet students, I just received this book a few days ago. (Thanks guys!) However, I did not need much introduction to this book, as I already owned the original hard-back edition as well.<br /><br />Paul Morphy was one of the greatest players who ever lived, statistically he dominated his generation in a fashion that Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov cannot touch.<br /><br />This is a great book, probably one of the most carefully written books on Morphy that you will find. It has OVER 400 games played by Morphy. All of his serious tournament and match games, as well as other games as well. (Games at odds, simultaneous games, blindfold games, etc.)<br /><br />Many of the games are carefully annotated, the author did a wonderful job here. Many of the mistakes that were made in earlier books are caught and corrected.<br /><br />This is NOT the ultimate biography on Morphy, it concentrates almost exclusively on Morphy's chess. (Chapters on Morphy's Openings, Morphy's Endings, etc.) And while I do not agree with every conclusion that the author reached, I do think that this is a LAND-MARK book ... and one that fully deserved to be reprinted.<br /><br />A few flaws, there are some obvious typo's in here. The diagrams in the Dover edition are not as clear as in the original hard-back book. Some of the pages have a grainy feel to them, a few pages in my book were not cut correctly and are slightly skewed.<br /><br />Overall, I give this book 4 stars. If you want to get better, you HAVE to study Morphy's tactics. This is the book to do it with. I highly recommend this book, despite the publisher's flaws. (All the older books on Morphy were in English Standard Descriptive Notation, this is one of the only books on Morphy in algebraic.)	2004-10-09

I first studied this book with a student of mine just after it was published. He purchased it, we would go over a game or two every lesson or so. Then last November, (2003); I purchased my own copy of this book. I can safely say that I have had this book long enough, and also spent enough time studying it - to do a reasonably intelligent review. (I have also chatted with many friends and students who have purchased this book, as well as having received about 10-20 e-mails as concerning this volume.)<br /><br /> First of all, the book is from &quot;Gambit&quot; Books ... suffice it to say that they have many fine chess books in their line and know exactly how to do a good job publishing a chess book. (Paper, binding, editing, etc.)<br /><br /> Secondly, this comes from a reasonably strong GM ... who is also a chess teacher and an author.<br /><br /> Thirdly, we have the collection. 50 games of recent vintage - no dinosaurs in here. The games are extremely well annotated; sometimes there is a comment after every move during the key part of a game. The emphasis here is on the opening and on tactics, but no phase of the game is neglected. The work here is VERY detailed, as a USCF Master, I found it both entertaining and challenging.<br /><br /> I gladly give this book five stars, even though I had said in the past I would not do this anymore.<br /><br /> There are some slight drawbacks to the book. I would not call them flaws, but I feel it my responsibility to point out a few possible stumbling blocks to a potential buyer.<br /><br /> 1. The book is best tackled by someone who is at least 1400-to-1500 in rating. I am quite sure a rank beginner would find this book much too complex and difficult to grasp. (The author could still learn a turn or two from the great Irving Chernev!)<br /><br /> 2. I found a few tactical flaws, but to be honest, it took hours and hours to find them using Fritz 8.0. I doubt that even a good 1800 player would notice these if they were not using a very strong chess program.<br /><br /> 3. I personally found a few of the variants hard to follow. I also had difficulty assessing a few of the positions. I am sure that the average player would feel the same way, perhaps even a little lost. This could have been resolved by ending each variation with a symbol that stands for which side stands better - and perhaps a brief note explaining why.<br /><br /> And while this might be a very tough and seemingly dense book, I would issue the following challenge. Buy this book, go over all the games and study it in depth. (Take at least a month.) Then every time you go up about 100 points review this book. I am willing to bet this is a book that you would continue to benefit from until your rating has surpassed the authors.

US	50708211	R3NH1XX90FYCYN	0812935713	473883625	The Chess Advantage in Black and White: Opening Moves of the Grandmasters	Books	4	30	32	N	N	A very solid choice of openings.	Here is a new book by Kaufman, who is (was) known for excellent writing about computer chess ... approximately 10-15 years ago. (This is my short review; I may post a longer one on my web site.)<br />The basic goal of this book is very singular and specific - to write a &quot;repertoire&quot; book for players who are interested in such things. (A book like this is to provide a student with a program to learn certain openings, in order to be prepared for any possible chess opening that a player might use against them.) The &quot;R.H.&quot; chess meter on the back cover places this book for players who fall between the &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; category. (HINT: Beginners would find this book of little or no use.)<br />I spent a lot of time in this book the past week, I went over most of the lines, and I analyzed some in great detail. My initial impression was very favorable. I can tell you that this is NOT one of those books that were bashed out in a great hurry.<br />The author is very frank and honest with you. He had some very specific goals when he wrote this book. (497 pages!) He did not want to always play the &quot;best and most fashionable lines,&quot; as this can be a very difficult proposition. (After 1.e4, c5; 2.Nf3, d6; the &lt;best&gt; move according to theory, is 3.d4. But this leads to the Open Sicilian, which could take up hundreds of books to really address properly. Instead Kaufman opts for the move, 3.Bb5+. It is simple, effective, and has a high surprise value. Additionally, there is no easy way to get to a draw, and White can still obtain a viable edge out of the opening.) The author avoided lines where castling on opposite sides occurred and everything hangs by one tempo, similarly he avoided other razor-sharp lines ... where the theory is likely to change on an almost daily basis. (He states in the introduction that he wanted to produce a book of lasting value, that might still be viable 10-20 years from now.) The author also used a &quot;committee&quot; of computer programs to help him find the best moves.<br />The author, IM Larry Kaufman, proposes that you play 1.e4, as White. (The core of your repertoire will be the Spanish Exchange. 1.e4, e5;  2.Nf3, Nc6;  3.Bb5, a6;  4.Bxc6, etc.)  He provides you with a sensible line for every possible opening that any opponent might try to use against you. There are dozens of very good suggestions in here. (And probably many &quot;TN's&quot; as well.) Kaufman also proposes that you meet 1.e4 with 1...e5; using primarily The Berlin Defense. (An excellent recommendation, a GM co-authored this chapter.) He also advises using the Semi-Slav against an opponent who opens with the Queen Pawn. (1.d4) His list of five criteria on page # 377 shows that much thought went into the choice of openings.<br />There are MANY positives to this book.<br /># 1.) Virtually any opening that a prospective opponent could pick is provided for. Many times, the line that you will use is solid, and very good. Not only do you stand an excellent chance of gaining a very concrete advantage, there is the distinct possibility that your opponent might not have studied these lines.<br /># 2.)  ALL the analysis has been meticulously checked with more than one computer program. (I found NO large or major mistakes.) Compare this ... to many other books that I have dealt with lately, where the author claims a computer was used, but the volume is still replete with many errors and mistakes.<br /># 3.)  Since many of these continuations are not main line theory, there is little chance that theory will change before you get a chance to use them.<br /># 4.)  The author explains the basic ideas and strategies of an opening at the beginning of each section or chapter.<br />I did find a few drawbacks to this book:<br /># 1.)  Many of the lines are VERY long, 15-25 moves, (or more). The emphasis here is on being able to memorize a lot of material for your next tournament. (If you forgeta line, you might be a dead duck.)<br /># 2.)  Many possible - and even likely moves - are not provided for by this author.<br /># 3.)  Some of the continuations examined here are distinctly inferior. {For one side.} Many improvements will probably be found before the next edition. (Despite what the author says, I doubt that a book like this would be of much use to a really strong Master, say rated 2400 or better.)<br /># 4.)  Some of the games are gross mis-matches. (Page 235 is one such example. White is rated nearly 2600, while Black holds an unimpressive 2215 rating.) I prefer to base my theoretical decisions on games between really strong players with less than a 150 point differential in their respective ratings.<br />But all these questions are secondary to the overall aim and quality of the book. (On a scale of 1-10, I would give the author at least a 7.5 here.)  This is an in-depth and high-quality book that deserves very serious consideration. Players rated 1000-2300 ... that have been searching for a REAL repertoire ... will find this book enormously helpful. Postal players will probably find that this book is a MUST!!<br />In closing, I truly liked this book; and give it a high recommendation.et a line, you might be a dead duck.) <BR># 2.)

It sounds almost silly to be reviewing a book that is nearly 20 years old! (Have I lost my mind?) Most opening books that are over 5 years old are considered dated - any book this old is genearlly considered a DINOSAUR!!<br />So why am I doing it? Just in the hopes you might buy and appreciate this book! (If it were current, I would eaily give it five stars.)<br />I purchased this book shortly after it first came out. (1989) I had a \\"real/regular\\" job back then, so it took me at least six months to work my way all the way through this book. I went through EVERY chapter. Some of the chapters, I literally played over every line, note, (etc.) that was given in this wonderful volume. I also studied several of the games in detail, writing out my thoughts in a spiral-bound notebook.<br />I was annotating a game today, (on the Pirc); that I played in one of the ICC/Dos Hermanos, {big} Internet tournaments. (I was trying to remember one line in particular. Because I had difficulty in recalling all the analysis, I had to dig this book out.) This gave me a chance to re-read a couple of chapters and go through a few of the variations. And I thought to myself, \\"What a great book this effort really is!\\"<br />And while this book may NOT represent the cutting edge of opening theory on the Pirc, it has many other redeeming features. The lines are laid out in a very logical manner, the author starts with the most popular lines, (The Austrian Attack); and goes from there. There is a TON of analysis, Nunn did not hold much back here. If he got to a point where he thought he saw a better move, he told you. (This book was written BEFORE chess programs got real strong, so check EVERYTHING you intend to play {in tournaments} with a good analysis engine ... or your favorite chess program!!)<br />The 'blurb' on the cover says \\"Intermediate,\\" but I am sure that even a near beginner could follow most of what goes on here, there are PLENTY of very good and frank discussions. The author really went out of the way here to do a really bang-up job. The most common-place ideas and plans are covered in here.<br />Last year I played in a \\"quick\\" (money) tournament in Alabama, (Game in 25 minutes); and I defeated a player (who used this opening) whose rating was nearly 2600 USCF. He paid me a very nice complement after the game. He told me that I had played very well and I had not used much time on the clock. I am sure that MUCH of my understanding of this whole opening was gained during the time I spent with Nunn - - - in this book! {Does this make me a Nunn student? I guess in a way, it does.}<br />I recommend this book VERY highly!!! (But buy a new book to get a feel for the latest opening lines.) I have literally hundreds of books on the opening - I have many on the Pirc as well. But I personally guarantee that if you spend some time studying inside these pages, you will learn more from this book than 50 other opening books; where all they do is pump out the latest games - with no explanation, whatsover!

(This is my short review, I may post a longer one on my web site.)<br />I have had this book for over a month now, and I have spent many, many hours reading this book and deeply analyzing the games that are given here. (I should also let you know that I am a chess-master with a fair size library, and that I am fairly well-read when it comes to the stories and the lives of the various World Champions.)<br />I think a comment on my review of the first volume is in order here, as it generated a great deal of e-mail - some of which was clearly negative. First, it is just one man's opinion! Secondly, if you check any of the popular web sites like ChessBase, you will find poking holes in the analysis of the first book has become something of a national sport for some people. (In particular, see the series of on-going articles by GM Karsten Mueller.)<br />When I first received this book, I had anticipated learning a great deal about these players that I did not know. In particular, good books on Euwe's life (in English) are fairly hard to come by. (This volume covers World Champions five through eight, i.e., Euwe, Botvinnik, Smyslov, and Tal.) I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Max Euwe, who was World Champion from 1935 to 1937. I had once read, (in a book by a popular American writer); that &quot;Euwe possessed a rather dry style,&quot; and that he was a strategist and a deep thinker. (he was) But here we see a different side of Euwe, he is pictured as a great tactician who was not afraid to enter into complications if the position called for it! (I found the combination against Speyer given on page 15 to be especially pleasing.) Overall, I really enjoyed this chapter ... and the look into the life of a multifaceted man that many call the last amateur World Champion.<br />I already knew a great deal about Botvinnik, but nonetheless enjoyed the chapter on this player immensely. I did not see a lot of new information ... but the chapter made pleasant reading. A slightly sour note was sounded by the discussion of how Kasparov and Botvinnik had ended their personal relationship. (Botvinnik's version of this tale is completely different than the one offered by Kasparov.)<br />The chapter on Smyslov was very entertaining and well presented. Truly the story of Smyslov's life has been a search for harmony ... both on and off the chessboard, and his games reflect this quality. The games themselves also make a good vehicle for this player, I doubt the average player will know many of these game prior to acquiring this book.<br />(They are all very beautiful!)<br />And finally, we have the chapter on the life of Tal. There is a lot of good and bad in this chapter, I personally (greatly) disagree with Kasparov's statement that Tal's game was about &quot;bluffing&quot; in chess. One cannot become World Champion without being a great player and able to play all phases of the game in at least an adequate manner! In my opinion, Tal returned &quot;dynamics&quot; to chess. With his emphasis on things like a high-intensity struggle, hand-to-hand combat, his willingness to sacrifice at almost any time ... Tal brought these elements back into chess at a time when it needed it the most. (Keres later noted that chess suffered from 'staleness' during this period. He said that it was in danger of dying the death of &quot;the gentleman's draw,&quot; and the &quot;win with White - draw with Black&quot; formula. Keres said that Tal's chess was like ... &quot; a breath of fresh air into a stuffy room.&quot;)<br />And now down to brass tacks. (Many of the complaints I had about the first volume will re-surface here.) A friend of mine - who is something of a chess historian - complained about the many errors in the names and the dates in this book. (One Harvard professor has put out a 7-volume set of books on the communist leaders of the {former} USSR. On page 161, Zhdanov should probably be rendered &quot;Zhidanov&quot; in English.)<br />Again there is a definite lack of focus. (About half the games in the Botvinnik chapter do NOT involve Botvinnik as one of the principle parties!) And the author promised the readers a definitive account, but skirts many of the thornier issues of chess history. For example: the fact that Keres was probably forced to throw games to Botvinnik. (Indeed, after Stalin died, Keres won like five games in a row off Botvinnik!) The authors touch on this, but do not really delve into this matter in any real or meaningful way.<br />An IM, who was initially very excited about the release of these books, now confides to me that he feels Kasparov had little to do with any of the work done here. A GM told me - on the condition that I did not disclose his name - that he also felt Kasparov did little of the real work involved in this project, and referred to these books as &quot;pot-boilers.&quot;<br />And probably the most important fact of all is the chess contained within this book. The web site of the publisher still promises analysis free of errors, in the introduction here the authors' state: many of these games will be &quot;analyzed anew with the help of a computer.&quot; (Page # 05.) Yet the number of errors contained within this book that I have already found are nearly too great to count. (In one case I found the authors concluded that White was better, but missed a simple combination that wins a piece. In another case they conclude the position is &quot;nearly equal,&quot; but miss a mate in three moves.)<br />One concrete example is the game that begins on page # 416. (Tal - Botvinnik, 1st Match Game.) This game is replete with errors, I found a problem with almost every note I looked at in detail!!  (More than 20 mistakes tallied so far.)<br />In closing, I would like to say that these books appear to be well produced, but fall far short of expectations - especially if your name is Garry Kasparov. But on the other hand, any amateur who is looking for a &quot;good read&quot; and some excellent games to look at, might enjoy this book quite a bit.

Gligoric was/is one of the greatest chess players of the twentieth century ... at one time, (mid-to-late 1950's - through the very early 70's); there was a very small group of players that the (Soviet) Russians really feared. They were Bobby Fischer, (of course!); Miguel Najdorf, Samuel Reshevsky, Bent Larsen, and this player. (GM Svetozar Gligoric)<br />Gligoric, (11 times Yugoslav Champ.); won many international tournaments and was an extremely feared competitor ... his first major success (a surprise) was Warsaw, 1947; ahead of such players like Boleslavsky, L. Pachman, and V. Smyslov. His string of victories at major international tournaments is almost too long to cover, a few highlights are, first at: Hastings, 1960/61; Reykjavik, 1964; The Hague (zonal), 1966; Tel Aviv (Israel); 1966; Varna, 1971; Los Angeles, 1974; and Montilla, 1977. He also had wins in about a dozen major key matches. (These are only clear firsts, his 'top five' list of tournament finishes would be too long to try and name here!) He is obviously a little older now, and past his {best} playing days.<br />Gligoric is also one of the most respected teachers and authors who ever lived, at least outside of Russia. He wrote mostly for newspapers and magazines, his few books (today) are considered collectors' items.<br />Anyone who 'grew up' or played chess in the 1970's will fondly remember his &quot;Chess Life &amp; Review&quot; articles. (I had a very small library of books as a teen-ager, but I carefully saved and indexed all of my magazines, Gligoric's &quot;Game of The Month&quot; was easily the most important theoretical articles that I had access to during that period.)<br />I respect and revere this player too much to go looking for mistakes with the help of the latest computer programs. (I found no serious mistakes in my rather casual review of about two dozen games.) My favorite game would be his win from the Black side of the Vienna Opening  ...  against another of my chess heroes, GM Bent Larsen.

Some of the positive things were that it was helpful to have the key points annotated, and the fact that the book is grouped by openings. The drawbacks were that some games had too many notes, and they found the complex things were explained, but simple maneuvers were not. (This means the best class of player that should buy this book should be 1600 or better.) Some of the lines are a little dated as well. (You could use &quot;Nunn's Chess Openings&quot; to cross-reference these lines.) I guess I would also have to add that I could NOT recommend this book to a beginner, or someone who has not been playing chess for very long.<br />In closing, I greatly enjoyed this book by Gligoric, the author has a deep love of chess and a level of understanding that few have ever attained.

(I teach chess on the Internet, build web pages about chess, etc.) I also often seek input and advice from my students about the books I review. I do not believe - as a Chess Master - that my views, desires, and needs for a chess book would be the same as the average player. Therefore I often feel it necessary to ask students what they thought of a book in order to get a more balanced approach.<br />This is a book that would have probably never seen the light of day, except for one very fortuitous event ... in 1999 GM Alexander Khalifman won the (FIDE) knock-out event to become the 14th World Champion. This book is written by Khalifman's trainer of 17 years - with input from the World Champion himself.<br />Personally - I liked this book quite a bit. I enjoyed reading the story of Khalifman's rise as a player, and how he became a Master, a GM and how he eventually became the World Champion. (Although at times the prose is a bit dry.)<br />On page # 36 we are given an extremely interesting battle between the protagonist of this book, and GM Tseshkovsky. We are given the story leading up to this game, and the events of the times, as they swirled around both players. But the problem is that the game is completely UN-annotated, we don't even get a single exclam or question mark to guide us. Trying to figure out exactly what the losing move was proved to be an EXTREMELY vexing task for two of my {former} students. I also think this is an example of lazy writing, the author should have taken another few hours and provided at least some light notes to this game. (Trying to interpret a difficult game like this is nearly an impossible task for a player rated 1600, or below.)<br />I could go on and on - provide you with many more examples - but I would be belaboring an obvious point. Suffice it to say that most of the games are only LIGHTLY annotated, especially in the early part of the book. (Example: Game # 14, page # 43. We are given the first six moves of the game vs. Ulybin, and then told: &quot;The Chatard-Alekhine is a formidable weapon in the hands of an aggressive player.&quot; While true, this is stating the obvious. It would have been more useful to discuss what some of the general ideas are, the methods of attack White might employ, or how current opening theory regards this whole system. The game is very snappy and attractive, however.)<br />Probably my favorite game of the whole book is the one versus GM Ermenkov from Elenite, 1994. (Game # 44, page # 76.) White sacrifices his Queen, or more correctly allows it to be trapped. All he gets for the lady is a lone Rook - which is normally not nearly enough. Then at the end of the game he even returns the Rook to press home his advantage. To say that this game is brilliant would be the under-statement of the year!<br />In closing, I would like to say that there is much &quot;meat&quot; in this book. Dozens of games, many of which do not seem to be in all the databases. There is a lot of reading to do, any big fan of Khalifman should be quite happy.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book ... but many of my students found it a very, very tough sled. I would NOT recommend this book to beginners. The average player who is looking for a book that will teach him about chess should also probably skip this book. The chess connoisseur, who enjoys well-annotated games, should not purchase this book as well. I also feel - very strongly - that lazy players, who cannot force themselves to work hard, would not enjoy this particular book at all.<br />Who should buy this book? Obviously all the fans and faithful followers of this player should acquire this volume. Plus I think any player who is looking for a {modern} GM to model themselves after, a player who is `soundly aggressive' if you will ... will also greatly enjoy this book. Any player who is looking to SERIOUSLY sharpen his tactics would also find a great deal of material here to chew on. In the end, you often get out of a chess book as much as you are willing to put into it. For the few who can commit to a real labor of love, then I think you will enjoy the life and games of Alexander Khalifman.

This person was nice enough to send me a copy of this book shortly after it was published - and asked me to review it. I had not forgotten about you in the least, I am just sometimes notoriously slow.<br />Secondly, you should probably know that I am a Life-Master, and I have made a living teaching chess on the Internet.<br />I should also add that one of the greatest chess books ever written was &quot;Logical Chess, Move-by-Move,&quot; by Irving Chernev. (A book that has remained popular over a very long span of time, and even chess editors and book publishers have told me they don't grasp the reason why.) This book is an obvious attempt to imitate the success of that fantastic teaching volume.<br />I read this book from cover-to-cover right after I first got it. I also played over a few of the games, but admittedly ... in a rather hurried fashion. I personally liked the book very much, and would have probably given it five stars. But I am a higher-rated player; this book was  NOT  meant for me. So what I think of this book is not nearly as important as what lower-rated players might have to say about this book.  ---&gt;  I also recently reviewed this book and played over about ten of the games, in preparation for writing this review.<br />One of the things I did right after receiving the book was to photocopy about 3 pages and mail this to dozens of friends and students, along with a questionnaire I had drawn up. I asked everyone to grade Nunn on about 20 different criteria, including writing style, clarity of thought, etc. I also asked those people who owned the copy of the book to review it briefly for me, tell me what they liked and what was less than perfect about this effort by Nunn. (Friends on the Internet have probably grown tired of my {nearly} constant questions about this subject!)<br />There are MANY positives to this book! There is a tremendous amount of prose, written in a very clear style. There is a comment after nearly every move, and there are more than enough variations to illustrate the various tactical points.<br />The comments and feedback from the people I contacted reinforced some of the criticisms I had of the book. This is what a few of these kind people had to say:<br />#1.)  &quot;Nunn is very good and his explanations are excellent. But sometimes the variations are too much.&quot;<br /># 2.) &quot;I liked this book very much, but I thought there were too many lines. These could have been replaced by more explanations of what was happening on the chess board.&quot;<br /># 3.) &quot;Nunn is good, over-all I feel I could learn a great deal from this book. But Nunn is kidding himself if he thinks I could ever calculate that far ahead. Heck, some days I do good to see one move ahead.&quot;<br /># 4.) &quot;Nunn is an extremely good teacher. But I think he misses the point in one case. His constant criticisms of general principles are misplaced in this type of book, without general principles I could not play chess.&quot;<br />There were many more comments. I also noticed several trends. The players who liked this book best:  were in the 14-to-16 hundred ...  up to about expert range. This was the group that seemed to have the most positive responses. (Which means he kind of missed the mark, in his intro he states he desired to reach those players who range from beginner to 1800.) Lower-rated players complained of being drowned in variations.<br />Perhaps the final test was when I read this book to a few of my own students, face-to-face, including my seven-year-old daughter. Almost all of these players required me to explain what Nunn was saying about half the time!<br />In closing, while I liked this book very much, I think the average player should read Reinfeld's &quot;The Complete Chess-Player,&quot; before tackling this particular volume. And while my own appraisal of this book remains very high, it seems that even Nunn could learn a few things fromthe timeless simplicity of the great Irving Chernev.from the timeless simplicity of the great Irving Chernev.	2004-01-25

Most (younger) players today don't even know who Averbakh is, at least as far as I can gather from a few conversations on-line with various chess players.<br />Here is a player who competed in 15 Soviet Championship Tournaments in the span, 1949-1969. (Something of a record.) He won the Premier Championship in 1954. His score, with more wins than draws, (+ 10,  = 9,  - 0!);  ... has few parallels in the history of this grand tournament. (Source:  &quot;The Soviet Championships,&quot; by B. Cafferty and Mark Taimanov.) He was in the  &quot;Top 10 Players&quot; in the world in 1959, according to Jeff Sonas's &lt;Chessmetrics&gt; website. And according to ELO, (in his book); Averbakh's best 5-year rating peak was 2615. (Adjusted for inflation, this would be at least 2675, in terms of FIDE ratings for 2003.) And Keene and Divinsky, in their fascinating but controversial book, &quot;Warriors of The Mind,&quot; rank him as the TWENTY-FIFTH  (# 25) greatest chess player who ever lived.<br />He is also a very distinguished player, an expert on end-game theory, (He has written over a dozen books on this topic.); a respected opening theoretician, (One Russian player told me, in an e-mail, that Averbakh has contributed material to literally thousands of articles in various Soviet magazines!); a widely read author, a judge of chess compositions, a FIDE arbiter, etc. (The list is almost endless!) He holds several titles in Russia to include &quot;Master of The Sport of Chess,&quot; and also &quot;Honored Chess Trainer.&quot;<br />So by now, you should realize that here is a player you should listen to and learn from. He has taken a volume of his games that was published in the USSR back in the 1950's, and enlarged and expanded it for a (new) publication in the press.<br />In the end, you get his 60 most memorable and best games (1943-1975) that was played over a career that has spanned some seven decades, although he plays very little now due to advancing age.<br />I received this book about a year ago ... many thanks to the {former} Internet student that sent me this book so that I could review it. I have played over all the games in this book, and studied about 10-15 relatively carefully. (I have also annotated a few of these games; they can be found on my various web sites.)<br />My conclusion is that this is an OUTSTANDING book, I was so pleased with it, I decided to reward it with five stars. The games in here are clean, accessible, and thoroughly explained. (A few of the lines are a shade dated, at least by the standards of modern opening theory.) But in the end, I think that the average player could definitely learn a great deal by a close study of the contests contained within this book.<br />In closing, I would like to add that I sent out a survey to many of my Internet students. The three or four who bought the book and responded had this to say about this volume: &quot;Excellent games, my Internet rating has gone up over a hundred points since I started studying this book,&quot; or &quot;I think studying all the end-games in this book will make me better in that phase of the game,&quot; and finally, &quot;I am really enjoying this book.

I have built entire web pages - and even web sites - dedicated to great, short games of chess. So I was very happy to see that a player of Nunn's stature do a book on this fun and instructive topic.<br />I don't know what motivated Nunn to write this book, but I am very thankful he did. He took his database, and decided (properly) that a miniature was any game that lasted only 25 moves. (or less)  \\"To my horror, there were over 65,000 such games.\\" - GM John Nunn. In order to get this down to a more manageable number, he decided to further limit the games to those where both players were rated at least 2500 (Elo) or better. This got the number down to around 1,300 games. Nunn then played through all of these and whittled the number down to about 120 games. [From the period 1971 to 1999.]  (He knew that some games would be eliminated once they were subjected to thorough analysis. The publisher had already given the mandate of only 101 games for the final version of the book for publication.)<br />I would have liked to see more detailed analysis, maybe some opening stuff and more commentary ... but Nunn notes the format of the work placed great restrictions on the amount of space. (Although we wonder why some games deserve five pages of analysis, and others only get one!)<br />But in the end, we are presented with 101 great games of chess. Some of these are true masterpieces, I doubt (very much) that the average player has seen more than a handful of these games prior to studying this volume.<br />Now the $64 question is: Is this book any good? And ...  \\"Will it help me get better?\\"<br />I think the answer to both questions is a resounding YES!!! Chess is a primarily about tactics. And the emphasis here is definitely on the \\"hand-to-hand\\" aspect of chess. Chess is also about surviving the opening and eliminating mistakes, and a careful study of this book will also help you achieve this goal as well. And to be really successful, your chess study should also be fun, and I think this book meets this criterion as well. I give this book my HIGHEST recommendation!!<br />There are a few shortcomings to this book. A couple of the examples are turkeys, and probably should not have been included ... they are definite lumps of coal in the presence of diamonds. A couple of the games are more curiosities and opening traps than they are real games of chess. (I.e., # 92. H. Spangenberg - V. Tkachiev;  BLACK wins in only 12 moves.) But much of this is really a matter of taste too.<br />A real oversight is the lack of any index. How many times did Kramnik make this collection? (Three times, that I can see.) How many times was the Najdorf Sicilian played? (Four times out of the first ten.) How many times did Tal score a touchdown? (More than once.)<br />It would have also been nice to see a list of groupings like: \\"The best win(s) in under 15 moves, the best Sicilians,\\" etc. It would have been nice to know what the sources were for some of the annotations. (Mostly they came from the Informants, I imagine.)<br />But in the end, this is a great little book. Its fun and it is filled with really scintillating tactics.

Everyone knows the story of Pillsbury - he was one of the greatest players who ever lived.<br />A dashing young man, he went as a completely unheralded talent to Hastings, 1895 - perhaps one of the greatest tournaments of chess history - and surprised everyone (but himself!) by taking clear first place. This placed him firmly in the ranks as one of the World's very best players.<br />The original book was ... and is a classic. (The first ever book in English on this player!) It is also in DESCRIPTIVE NOTATION.<br />This volume is simple profiteering. It is a copy of the original by the publishers. (Hardinge Simpole) It looks like a bad copy, and it is. Many of my pages are so washed out; I can barely make out the words and the moves. On one page, there is a large ink blotch that practically obliterates the move. The diagrams have NOT been re-done; they are simple, extremely poor copies of an old-style type of diagram that was not all that great to begin with. Virtually all the defects of a really bad photo-copy are present in this volume. This might be bearable in an old book, or in a very inexpensive volume. But in a book I paid nearly 35 bucks for ... this is simply unacceptable.<br />If you are a huge fan of Pillsbury - and cannot live without this book, you may want to consider purchasing this offering. But my advice is don't waste your money.	2003-11-23

My Review of:  &quot;The Winning Chess Series,&quot; by GM Yasser Seirawan. (If you need to know, I am a LifeMaster of Chess.)<br />This series was originally published by Microsoft Press, and unfortunately it was allowed to go out of print. This was a shame, as it was simply one of the finest series ever written.<br />Now another publisher, Everyman Press, is bringing this series back. This is good, as a series of chess books this good comes along VERY rarely. The bad part about it is that EveryMan has not taken the care and the time to do things right.<br />A local student came to me recently and said that they wanted to learn chess. I told them to purchase this entire series, which they did. I also own the original series by MSP. I sat down and did a &quot;side-by-side&quot; comparison of the two different versions.<br />I came to the conclusion that they were nearly exact copies, but for the following problems:<br /># 1.)  The paper is grainy and has a strange feel to it.<br /># 2.)  Many of the diagrams look just like a really bad photocopy. (black and white - with a great degree of variance)<br /># 3.)  The volume on &quot;Winning Chess Openings,&quot; uses the most bizarre-looking font for the diagrams I have ever seen in a chess book. (It's just plain ugly.)<br />The original series earned my HIGHEST recommendation. The words here are the same, even if the quality of the printing job is not. The material in here is some of the best instructional material ever printed, if you can get by the defects of the publisher.	2003-11-13

Before you read my review, you should know that I am a Life-Master of Chess.<br />And lately, it seems I have been bashing books - my reviews have generated a lot of e-mail - some has been rather negative. But I am always honest, and I always try to point out any flaws or mistakes that I find. As the man says: &quot;I call 'em the way I see 'em.&quot;<br />So it is with a great deal of pure joy that I tell you ... I LOVED THIS BOOK!!<br />(In fact, I have created several new web pages ... just with the material that this book contains. With a search engine, you should find it easily.)<br />This book is NOT perfect; I have found quite a few errors. For example: on page # 168, (second column); the note after move after move 35.Ne6, the author gives: &quot;Also losing is 35.Rdb1, Nh3+; 36.Ke1,&quot; etc. BUT 35...Nh3 is NOT the best move. (35...Ne4 is MUCH better.) In fact, ...Nh3 is NOT even check!! &lt;giggle&gt;<br />And I do not entirely approve of the author's &quot;Top Ten.&quot; #1 is from a game where the loser said it was, &quot;one of the worst games he ever played.&quot; (But all losers might say this!) His number five is almost an exact copy, (in type, AND theme); to his number one. And on it goes. Games from lesser-known players, games of questionable content, moves that are NOT even real double-exclams. (Real mistakes are the lack of some simple, thorough player and position indexes.)<br />BUT!!!! All these are minor quibbles, really. (The author covers this ground in his intro.) Consider all the really FANTASTIC THINGS that this book offers:<br /># 1.)  200 of the BEST - and most astounding - chess moves ever played;<br /># 2.)  EVERY phase of the game is covered. (Opening, middle-game, end-game.);<br /># 3.) Some really GREAT analysis, I estimate the author worked at least a year on this book. The analysis of some of the moves (alone) ... is worth the price of the book! The author holds NOTHING back!! In one of the examples, the author points out things like themes, recurring tactics, and opening traps!!<br />Chess IS tactics. And this book is really all about tactics. And there are no easy ones in here. I had my daughter pick about 30 problems at random. Half of these I knew, they are from fairly well-known chess games. But of the ones I did not already know the answer to, I correctly solved only three problems!! (I don't count problems where I guessed the solutions.) If a Master needs to work on this area, how about you?<br />At last - a FUN book, that if used intelligently - will help you get better at chess. And once you have spent some time with this book, you will have a smile almost as big as mine! Outstanding!!e themes, recurring tactics, and opening traps!!<br />Chess IS tactics.

It has been over 35 years since Fischer published his &quot;60 Memorable Games,&quot; ... not counting Nunn's travesty ... or other poor attempts to revise it. And there has not been a single really good - NEW - book on Fischer in over 15 years! (Most of the better books on Fischer are unfortunately OUT OF PRINT - and nearly impossible to obtain.)<br />The general rumor {in advance} was that Soltis was going to analyze all the same games that Fischer did in his Magnum Opus, and then add 40 more to round things off to an even 100. The first five games in the Fischer book are: vs. Sherwin, (N.J. Open, 1957); vs. Larsen, (Portoroz IZ, 1958); vs. Petrosian, (same tourn); vs. Pilnik, (Mar del Plata, 1959); and vs. Rossetto. (Also Mar del Plata, '59.) The first 5 games in the Soltis book are vs. D. Byrne, (Rosenwald, NY 1956 - The \\"Game of The Century.\\"); Di Camillo, (NY, 1956); vs. Bernstein, (U.S. Champ, NY; 1957-58); vs. Sherwin, (same); and then the Fischer - Larsen game. So it is obvious this is NOT just Soltis's turn at re-doing the Fischer book.<br />First, Soltis is a well-known chess-player and columnist. He has written many chess books. He has an outstanding reputation in the chess community. My students tell me that he is one of the most accessible and easy to understand authors around today. (The Reinfeld or Chernev of modern times.)<br />The book is thoughtfully crafted; the annotations are (mostly) precise. There are 100 games here that were chosen for their content, and then they were thoroughly annotated. (There are many games the average chess fan will not have seen before.) NO fan of Bobby Fischer (or Soltis) should miss this book. Any aspiring student will certainly learn a lot about the game by a very careful study of the material that is presented here. And there is quite a bit of thoughtful and new biographical material presented here by Soltis.<br />Having said that, I must vent my frustrations about the things that I saw that I did not like. Soltis definitely uses TOO MANY question marks ... often he uses a sledge hammer when a lighter tool would have sufficed. (The &quot;Modern School&quot; of annotating.) Many times, the question marks only raise issues that the author does not even bother to explain. (This can be very frustrating to the student who wants to know why the move was bad.) And how can we measure games that were played nearly 50 years ago by the standards of today's modern opening theory? (I also don't think Soltis uses a computer to analyze chess games.)<br />Soltis also has not spent the time on some of the games that he could. If anyone is curious, see the game Fischer - Portisch, Stockholm Interzonal, 1962. (Game # 28, page # 86.) I think this is one of Fischer's best games, and one of the greatest R+P endings ever played!! (I have been saying this for close to 25 years. A curious person could use any search engine and find my annotations of this game on the Internet.) Soltis comes close to butchering this classic contest.<br />But all hair-splitting aside, this is a very good book about one of the greatest players who ever lived. Just about ANY aspiring chess student will want to add this book to his library. Any student who gets this book ... and applies himself or herself ... will definitely learn (and enjoy!) a great deal about the Royal Game we all love.tis definitely uses TOO MANY question marks ... often he uses a sledge hammer when a lighter tool would have sufficed.

You should also know I have written extensively on the subject of \\"The World's Greatest Players,\\" ... many different state chess magazines have printed my thoughts on this subject. (I also have several pages on my web site that cover this.)<br />For example, some of the factors to be considered are:<br />#1.) Strength of opposition, (Who did he play? Were they any good?);  #2.)  The aging factor, (These authors call this the \\"era effect.\\" In chess, a player's strength decreases dramatically after about age 45.);  #3.) Career span, (How long did a player play, and for how long was he really good?). Some of the factors these authors do NOT address is the accumulation of general theory, (Could a player of 1850 beaten a player of 1950?); player effectiveness, and how much a player contributed to the overall advancement of the science/theory of the game. They also touch upon, but do not really delve into, one of the most effective measuring tools one could use for this task:  i.e., how far was this player ahead of the rest of his generation of players ... especially at their peak?<br />This book is a re-print of a book that first came out I 1989; much of the material in here is already rather dated. (This means that players like Anand and Kramnik are NOT even mentioned, as they had yet to make their mark on the chess world.)<br />The object of this book is to find the greatest {CHESS} player who ever lived. The authors say that they are embarking on the on this mission with zeal, yet they are going to be more objective than anyone has ever attempted to be. Yet it seems to me that the authors started out with a preconceived notion of who the best player was, and then constructed an elaborate artifice to justify their conclusions. (In one of their early lists, Andrei Sokolov comes out as number FOUR. The authors then attempt to \\"massage\\" their data in an effort to make this unbelievable blooper go away!) The authors also start out with a fairly small number of players, (64); statistically this - in and of itself - is a tremendous blunder!

First I should let you know that I am a chess master ... and that I have made my income mostly from chess for over 10 years now. I also have one of the world's biggest and best private (chess) web sites. (Many of my long reviews are posted there.)<br />This is a widely acclaimed book, it has generated a lot of fervor in the press.<br />I have had the book now for almost a month; it is no exaggeration to say that I could not put it down for the first two weeks or so.<br />I should inform you that it is an unfortunate fact of life that most of the (chess) books coming out of the old/former Soviet Union are \\"ghost-written\\" by minor players, trainers, etc. And if you check the dust-jacket, you will see that D. Plisetsky (and friends?) had a large hand in writing this book. And we are never really sure how much of the writing here is actually Garry Kasparov's work.<br />I hate to say it, but this book is positively riddled with errors. Kingston, Winter, and others have already pointed out numerous errors in their book reviews on the Internet - there is no need for me to delve into them here. (Except for the fact that Morphy did NOT \\"settle\\" in New York, as the authors here claim.) There are also MANY analytical errors, I found some in nearly every game that I examined!! For example: Take the game Pillsbury - Lasker; Cambridge Springs, 1904. After the move 21...Qc5!; we find the note: \\"But not 21...Rc8; 22.Qd4, Bc6; 23.Rxf6+!\\"  The move ...Rc8; is one of the main tries here for Black. But 22.Qd4? is probably the SECOND or THIRD best move here. And 22...Bc6?? is simply a terrible move, it changes the computer's evaluations - FOR THE WORSE - by at least 5-to-10 points! (Forced was 22...Qd5; or even 22...Rxc4.) In fact the analysis of this encounter is SO bad, I only have to assume that the computer was not used ... or was turned off!  (The publisher's website tells us every single move was meticulously computer checked, Kasparov himself affirms this in the intro/forward of this book.)<br />There are many other problems with this book as well. I would have expected to see all the best games of the four World Champions examined in detail - but this is not the case. Many of their losses are examined as well. In some cases you could say that the author was simply trying to be fair and that we are trying to get a balanced look at these players strengths and weaknesses. But in other cases, (Tchigorin - Gunsberg); I can find no relevant rationale for the inclusion of these games ... except that in many cases, these are famous games, and the author simply wanted to take a whack at them! (A definite lack of focus in a volume of this size.) Another major gaffe in a book of this size is NO bibliography. We may only scratch our heads and wonder at the author's sources. There are also ... TOO MANY QUESTION MARKS!!! I often wondered if Garry is even capable of being fair and objective - especially as concerns these older games. (How many of these new moves would have been discovered at all - except for the invention of the computer?)<br />By now, you might be thinking I hated this book. I actually liked it a lot. But I am just not sure if I can recommend this book to the average chess player, with the number of flaws that I know it contains. It is a real pity too, as with a little more work and some careful editing, this could have been a real landmark of chess literature.of this book.) <br />There are many other problems with this book as well.

Most/all of the errors in the original edition have been corrected as well.<br />I recently did a survey on the Internet. I asked the people who responded to rate about 50 books in the following fashion: 1.) Not recommended. 2.) Recommended, but perhaps with some reservations. 3.) Highly recommended. EVERYONE WHO REPLIED TO THIS SURVEY ... INCLUDING ABOUT A DOZEN MASTERS! ... RATED THIS BOOK IN THE THIRD CATEGORY!!! (highly recommended)<br />This book is simply written ... and logically laid out.

(on the Modern Benoni)	I have had dozens of requests to review this book, 3 or 4 in the last few weeks alone. So ... by popular request - - - (I first started working on this review back in May or June of this year.) You should also know I am a Life-Master, and I have taught chess (professionally) for a number of years now. {I also have played the Benoni many times in tournaments.}<br />The first thing you notice when you pick up this book is the black color and the chessboard and pieces on the cover. The striking logo by the publisher, and the blurb on the front cover promises you: \\"THOROUGH coverage and INSIDER knowledge of a controversial opening system,\\" by John Watson. (my emphasis) The book is fairly large ... a tad over 200 pages.<br />The price is fairly hefty; some book dealers want close to thirty bucks for this volume. (Thank goodness {for} Amazon.com!)<br />The cover is a sturdy flex-type; the pages are opaque with minimal `bleed-through.' The font is very good, clear and easily readable. The diagrams are excellent. The typesetting was done by P. Nunn, and the editor was G. Burgess. Overall, you cannot ask for a better team than the one that this publisher, (Gambit); brings to you.<br />One thing that I noticed almost right away was the way the author handles certain systems. For example, instead of having separate chapters for \\"The Mikenas Attack,\\" (and several other related systems); \\"The Early Nf3 and e5 Lines,\\" (for lack of a better name); and \\"The Taimanov `Anti-Benoni' System,\\" (8.Bb5+) ... ... ... the author takes the liberty of lumping them all under one chapter. (This is not necessarily bad, I would have preferred to have independent treatment of these complicated lines.)<br />So I began to study the lines. Although we are told the author used several chess analysis-engines to check his work, I found at least six or seven `holes' and/or oversights in just one chapter. I also found that I could NOT find many of my favorite lines in this book. For example: In Chapter 5, beginning on page 72, (After the moves 1.d4, Nf6;  2.c4, c5;  3.d5, e6;  4.Nc3, exd5;  5.cxd5, d6;  6.e4, g6;  7.f4, Bg7;) one of the sharpest and most controversial lines is the Mikenas Attack with 8.e5!? The main lines begin with 8...dxe5; any ECO will reveal this. But the author does NOT even examine these lines ... preferring to recommend (instead) the playable, but somewhat tame 8...Nfd7. (He does not even bother to analyze the alternatives.)<br />This scenario is repeated over and over. For example, In Chapter Six (6), the author deals with the \\"Fianchetto Systems,\\" (pg. # 110) ... or those lines where the player of the White pieces choose to play an early g3, followed by Bg2 and then Castles. (0-0) Line # A311) page # 117, we find White playing the move, 12.Nc4. Now the hottest and topical lines are ALL the ones that follow the move, 12...Ne5. (They also might be the ones that give Black the greatest winning chances.) But IM J. Watson refuses to look at these lines, and instead provides the comment: \\"Theory approves of 12...Ne5; as well, but the theory on it could fill a small book. In my opinion, 12...Nb6; is fully satisfactory and provides plenty of winning chances.\\" And turning to page # 120 after the move, 13...Nb6; the author again does not even bother to look at the move 13...Ne5; (`!') and instead tells us:  \\"I'm choosing this move to be consistent with the 12.Nc4, Nb6; of Line A311. Most of the same themes certainly apply.\\"<br />Now I don't know about you, but when I plunk down my hard-earned cash for a large book, I darn well expect the author to at least look at the main lines of any variation - especially after both the front and back cover promises: \\"thorough coverage\\" and \\"invaluable\\" analysis.<br />The above scenario repeated itself over and over again, I would look for the \\"main line\\" in a certain variation, only to have the author brush it aside and offer an inferior or less-played alternative. In fact, this happened so often, I went lookingfor the reason; I found it buried in the foreword to this book. The author tells you there that this book does NOT offer you comprehensive coverage, but rather this is a book where Watson chooses your repertoire for you, and ONLY analyzes those lines he deems as suitable or playable.<br />So let's talk about what is (majorly) WRONG with this book:<br />#1.) Many lines are NOT covered or analyzed at all.<br /># 2.) Players of the White pieces will find this book almost useless ... unless they are overly concerned with what this author's devout followers might have his devotee's playing.<br /># 3.) Too many sub-variations. (Many of the lower-rated players I showed this book to could not navigate their way through some of the endless lines contained in the various notes.)<br /># 4.) NOT enough verbiage and explanation telling us what the ideas and common threats are in any particular situation.<br /># 5.) Doubtful evaluations. (See page # 146. He considers this position equal, a check with any of the popular programs will reveal White has at least a slight edge and went on to win.)<br />So having said everything above, what is RIGHT about this book?<br />#1.) A complete repertoire. Any player who is rated BELOW 1800, (and isn't terribly ambitious); will find a complete system that he could play against virtually ANY conceivable line.<br /># 2.) MUCH new and original analysis - the author was not afraid to go out on a limb and look at many alternatives that have not been previously explored by theory. Any player who is looking for new and original ideas to surprise an `over-booked' opponent, should definitely check this book out.<br /># 3.)  The analysis to the Taimanov System and the Modern Main line is a real blessing and almost completely rehabilitates some of these systems for the second player. (These two chapters are the book's redemption and make it worth the cost of this book, at least in my opinion.)<br />Players who want complete and concise analysis of the Modern Benoni will not find it here. (See the book by Kinsman instead.) Players who want a COMPLETE repertoire and maybe like the idea of going `out of book' early to surprise some players - should definitely consider getting this book.for the reason; I found it buried in the foreword to this book.

I purchased very shortly after it became available. (The release date was like June of this year, but they may have come out with it a little early.)<br />First you should know I am a LIFE-Master at chess, for many years now I have made my living by teaching chess on the Internet, building chess web pages, and writing about the game. (You will find a deeply annotated game in this line on my web site.)<br />The next thing I should tell you is that if you are a beginner or have played chess less than 1-2 years, DON'T buy this book!<br />But let's say you are not a beginner, and you feel experienced enough to tackle a book of this kind. There are still a lot of things you should know.<br />First off, the King's Indian Defense is an EXTEMELY complicated and difficult opening. I played my first chess tournaments in the 1960's but did not begin playing frequently until the very early `70's. I purchased the giant book on the K.I.D. (the hard-back one by Barden, Hartston, & Keene); and I began to study. I memorized literally hundreds of the lines in the book. But when I played this difficult opening in tournaments, I usually lost, and often lost badly. (Eventually I abandoned the opening entirely - or at least gave it up for over 20 years.) And I have heard of similar experiences by other players who went on to become experts or even masters at chess. AFTER I broke Master, I bought a few books on this opening and began studying again. And although I did better than before, my experiences with this opening were less than perfect. (I relate this just so you will understand what a difficult opening the \\"King's Indian Defense\\" really is.)<br />This is not to say that the King's Indian is unplayable ... far from it!! Geller, Boleslavsky, Bronstein - and many other Soviet players of that generation mapped this dynamic opening out. (\\"Before E. Geller, we did not understand the King's Indian.\\" - Mikhail Botvinnik.) And of course Bobby Fischer used the K.I.D. so much ... it was really his \\"meat and potatoes.\\"  And Garry Kasparov has also used the King's Indian quite a bit ... and won many beautiful and brilliant games with it. (Many modern GM's use this opening today.)<br />The next thing you will want to know is that this is a high-quality book, by a publisher (Batsford), which has a lot of experience publishing chess books. Nice and sturdy flex-cover, a good job of translation, good editing, a good font, excellent diagrams, pages with little bleed-through, a very solid job of organizing, etc.<br />The author, Svetozar Gligoric - who is getting older and is probably past 70 now - was once one of the best players in the World. (FIDE rated him as being in the top ten in the world in the late 50's and early 60's. `ChessMetrics' says he was in the `TOP 50' in the world from the late 1940's ... all the way until 1980!!! His peak seems to have been in '58 or '59 when he was ranked as # 6 in the world with a rating of 2682. ChessBase's player database says his best ELO was in January of 1976, {he was 52}; with an official rating of 2575.)<br />But don't let my discussion of this man's age throw you off. While his best playing days might be behind him, this guy has probably forgotten more about chess than most of us will ever know. He has faced such titans of chess as Botvinnik, Fischer AND Kasparov over the chessboard. He has won the Championship of his country - Yugoslavia - many times. He was an official Candidate for the World Championship numerous times as well. He was once the strongest player outside of the USSR and is also one of the pioneers of this opening. (I very fondly remember his \\"Game of the Month\\" in the `Chess Life' magazine. It was my favorite column for years!) He has written dozens of highly acclaimed chess books in Europe and is also a recognized and revered chess teacher.<br />So are we ready to talk about the specifics of this particular book now?<br />This book is ONLY about ONE opening, The King's Indian Defense. Further, it is ONLY about a sub-system of this opening known as \\"The Mar del Plata Variation.\\" (Really none other than Fischer pioneered this system - he above anyone else is the player whose sparkling victories inspired others to play this line.) This line occurs after the following moves:  1.d4, Nc6;  2.c4, g6;  3.Nc3, Bg7;  4.e4, d6;  5.Nf3, 0-0;  6.Be2, e5!;  7.0-0, Nc6;  8.d5, Ne7. THIS is the Mar del Plata system ... and nothing else! (Black's position looks cramped, but he has many dynamic possibilities.) The very first game of the book on page # 12, is the contest: GM M. Najdorf - GM S. Gligoric; Mar del Plata, 1953.<br />This book is laid out in three main sections, a total of 14 chapters. There is a list of illustrative games, a historical introduction, the main part of the book, and a very good index of variations.<br />I have spent many hours with this book. I have looked at least 15 of the games; several I have analyzed in detail. In a few of these, I have checked every line and note with a strong chess computer program. (Fritz 8.0) I have found one or two (minor) errors ... and one line where it appears a move pair was left out. But overall the quality of this book is extremely high. Very good analysis and explanations as well. Some of the illustrative games are superb!<br />[Now in case you think I am blowing smoke: here are a few of the books I own on this line ... and I won't even mention much older books:  &lt;The Main Line King's Indian> and &lt;The Classical King's Indian> both by Nunn and Burgess; &lt;The Samisch King's Indian,> by GM J. Gallagher; &lt;The Fianchetto King's Indian> by Colin McNab; &lt;The KID, Averbakh Variation> by Margeir Petursson; &lt;The King's Indian for The Attacking Player,> by Graham Burgess; &lt;Beating The KID with 5.Bd3!> by GM A. Soltis; &lt;The KID, 6...Nc6;> by IM John Watson; &lt;The KID, Four Pawns Attack> by M. Thomas; several INFORMANT monographs on this opening, etc. I also own all five of \\"The Encyclopedia's of Chess Openings,\\" and many INFORMANTS to boot.]  So when I say I have seen a few books on this opening, you should take my word on it.<br />This is a high-class book with fantastic analysis by a world-class expert on this line. My only really valid criticism of this book? Since the late 1980's or early `80's, the \\"Bayonet Variation,\\" (9.b4!?) has dominated GM Praxis in this line. But this variation is the last chapter in the book, and the book is dominated by analysis of 9.Ne1. (The author has also chosen many of his own games, when a perusal of NIC Year-books would show other games are more important.)<br />Now let me give you some advice: If you are not a Master, you should get the following books: Nunn's Chess Openings; Modern Chess Opening's, 14th edition by Korn and de Firmian; and one other all-round book on the King's Indian. If you are a really serious competitor, you might need both of the books on this opening by Nunn and Burgess. If you are below 1500, you will probably need at least one good \\"How To Play\\" the King's Indian. I also recommend you take at least a few lessons from a teacher in your area to insure you understand the basic ideas of this line. (Barring this, find a player who is at least rated higher than you who might be willing to be your study partner.)<br />In closing, let me say this is a great book. My only regret was that it was not around when I first started playing this line! And if you are a postal player, this book is a MUST!!particular book now?<br />This book is ONLY about ONE opening, The King's Indian Defense.

This book was written by one of the strongest players who ever lived, and who also was considered one of the best chess teachers of all time. (He was also one of the FIVE ORIGINAL Grand-Masters of chess!)<br /># 3.)  The games are grouped chronologically; there is also a good index of openings. (Giving you two good study plans for this book.)<br />I will also say that a student of mine from Texas purchased this book. (His Mom is from here; they spent a great deal of his summers here.) When he bought this book, he was rated 1400, a year later he was over 1800! While I cannot promise you similar improvement, I feel sure - as a LIFE-Master - that you WILL improve if you conscientiously study the games in this book!!	2003-07-29

This book is quite simply a treasure.<br />I used to have an older copy of this same book, but after nearly 30 years it practically disintegrated, so I purchased a new copy.<br />The first thing was that I was impressed by the quality of this new edition. A nice flex-cover, clear, white pages with a very clear font, diagrams ... nothing seems to have been missed. You even get a few black-and-white photographs.<br />The games are as carefully and lovingly annotated as any player could want. (Sometimes there is literally a comment after every move!) Additionally, you get a constant update as to the times the players took on each move. (Any serious tournament player could try to model themselves from this ... knowing when to think and when not to is important information for any competitor in rated events. Most books do NOT give you this kind of information!)<br />Some reasons NOT to buy this book:<br /># 1.)  If you are a bare-bones beginner, there are many much better books out there that are probably better suited for teaching you the game. (But I do not see how anyone who seriously applied himself or herself would not improve after a careful study of this book.)<br /># 2.)  Do not buy this book thinking casual study will turn you into this type of player. These two were the paragon of chess. Studying these games will help you improve, but statistically your chances of playing at this level of chess is very small, the odds are greater that you will win a lottery. (But the explanation ... AFTER EVERY MOVE - in some cases - will certainly be an eye-opener for most students.)<br /># 3.)  Don't buy this book thinking it is the latest in chess theory, many of these lines are NOT being played today!!!<br />The main reason you would want to purchase this book is that you love the game and would like to study Tal's exquisite notes ... some of the best ever written by a competitor at this level. THIS IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE BEST BOOK ON ANY WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - - - PERIOD!!!!!  I would think that this is a book you would come back to again and again and again!!!!!!  I would think that this is a book you would come back to again and again and again!	2003-07-11

I purchased this book once before, but it...kinda got away from me...I just got this book just a few days ago, and I could not be more pleased. I have been analyzing these games on my own for almost 3 years now.<br />I am a Master, and I used to make a living by (mostly) teaching chess on the Internet.<br />This is an excellent book by a publisher, (Everyman Chess); that has already made a reputation of producing top-class chess books.<br />So what do you get when you buy this book? A lot - in my opinion. You get a welcome and an introduction by Tony Blair himself. Then there is an interesting chapter on the Brain-Games network...You get a chapter on the trophy, the history of the World Championship. Then you get a chapter on the biographies of the {previous} World Champions, with a game from each one of them. (An unexpected treat, to be sure!) Then you get a complete chart and review of all the games that Kramnik and Kasparov have played prior to this match. (They had a tie score prior to this match.) Then you get a chapter on the match, each game is sufficiently analyzed. You also get a chapter on summary and the future of chess. There are also a few nice photo's in the middle of the book.<br />The analysis is excellent, albeit somewhat brief. (People who are familiar with Keene's method and style will know what I am talking about.) Most important game details are covered; although it is virtually impossible to cover every single possibility.<br />{I spent about three-and-a-half hours going over five of the games ... while using Fritz 8.0 to look for any errors. I found none.}<br />BUY THIS BOOK:<br /># 1.) If you want to study the games of a recent World Championship.<br /># 2.) You are looking for some serious study material of what happens when two VERY good players meet across the chessboard.<br /># 3.) If you want to know how Kasparov, still the World's # 1 player by rating, managed to lose the World Title. (to anyone)<br /># 4.) If you are wanting so study the games DEEPLY... and try to improve.<br />DON'T BUY THIS BOOK:<br /># 1.) If you are looking for an extremely detailed analysis of each game.<br /># 2.) If you think you can just play over a few of these games and learn how to play like Kasparov or Kramnik.<br /># 3.) You are a beginner and looking to get better.<br />(Get Silman's books, and maybe Reinfeld's, \\"The Complete Chess Player,\\" instead.)<br />All in all... a darn good buy for the money I spent.e games DEEPLY... and try to improve. <br />DON'T BUY THIS BOOK:<BR># 1.)

Dover reprint. (1995)  ISBN: # 0-486-28614-2<br />I used to have an original hardback version of this book - autographed by F. Reinfeld himself! I had to purchase another copy ... my last copy fell apart. (It was extremely old and the victim of overuse and abuse.)<br />First a note about the publisher. (Dover.) They specialize in reprinting older books, and have a very good reputation amongst chess players. Nice `flex' cover, and a very sturdy binding. The fonts are clear and bold, and the diagrams are also very good; I had no problems visualizing the combinations working from the diagrams alone. The pages are not as opaque as I would like to have them, however.<br />This is one of the best books ever written. Who wouldn't want to study the very best games of the best tournaments ... played by some of the greatest players of all time? (Lasker, Alekhine, etc.)<br />The very first game - Schiffers vs. Harmonist, from Franfort, 1887 - is an eye opener in itself. 16.Re8!! is an absolute stunner of a move ... all the more shocking because at first glance it appears to be a blunder.<br />The student will learn much from this book, an extremely detailed study of this book would greatly help improve your tactics. There are tactics and ideas for combinations in here that I bet you have NEVER seen before!! It is difficult to believe that any average player - who studied this book in a thoughtful and thorough manner - would not improve. Every lover of beautiful chess will want this book as well; the games are the cream of the crop.<br />Some people will rag on this book and complain about it. \\"The opening lines are somewhat dated,\\" they will say, and this is true. \\"Some of these players in here are guys you may have never heard of.\\" \\"So what?,\\" I would respond. The ONLY real criterion in a book like this should be the games themselves - and nothing else! These have been carefully and lovingly scrutinized by Reinfeld. They are also annotated pretty thoroughly ... the author has anticipated many of the more common questions that would be asked by the average chess player.<br />In the end, I would rate this book perfect, but not for the following flaws: # 1.) The pages have a little \\"bleed-through,\\" especially in very strong light; # 2.) Too few diagrams; # 3.) The lack of player or opening indexes in the back of the book; # 4.) THIS BOOK IS IN THE OLD ENGLISH STANDARD DESCRIPTIVE NOTATION!!! If you have severe problems with this notation, than I recommend that you avoid this book.<br />But if the above drawbacks don't faze you, and you are looking for a VERY good deal, (inexpensive); on a chess book ... then maybe you should try this book out!d by Reinfeld.

(I have had this book for several years now.)<br />First you should know that I am a Chess Master that for many years has made a living from teaching chess. Secondly, I am also a huge fan of Andy's, but I will try to be objective as possible here.<br />The books starts off with an Introduction, and in it is a very funny and amusing story as told by Pat Wolff to Charles Fried, the former Solicitor General in the Reagan Administration. (I also wish to note that only people who are familiar with the plight of chess players in the U.S. can even begin to comprehend what he is talking about.)<br />Chapter One is entitled, \\"A Champion Is Crowned.\\" It is the story of one Charles H. Stanley, the first official U.S. Champion. (Did you know that the first U.S. Championship was a match between Stanley and Rousseau? And that it was played in New Orleans in 1845? Most people think Morphy was the first U.S. Champion, but that is a common misconception.)<br />Chapter Two is about Paul Morphy. (Who else?) There are chapters with titles like, \\"The King Is A Captain.\\" (Chap. # 3.) Or ... \\"The Years Of Confusion.\\" Or even \\"The Man Who Enjoyed It.\\" I could go on and on, but I trust by now you get the general picture. This is a great book. Its NOT just a chess book, but a history book as well. And one that is thoroughly enjoyable to read.<br />My favorite chapter would have to be the one that covered the life and times of Samuel Reshevsky. His `squeakers' and come-from-behind finishes are most enthralling to read about. And the way that Soltis describes it, one almost feels as if you were there ... re-living the events as they happen.<br />Practical every era and period of chess is covered. Nothing is left out. There are dozens - if not hundreds - of game fragments, and many nicely annotated games as well. Soltis often gives you a `blow-by-blow' that other chess authors will not trouble to do. You find out many stories that may have stayed permanently behind the scenes if not for this book.<br />You get 8 pages in the middle of the book with 16 truly beautiful photographs. At the end of the book is nearly everything a chess person could want or desire: # 1.) A complete summary; # 2.) Individual records;  # 3.) An Openings Index;  # 4.) An ECO openings index, # 5.) A general index.<br />And there are even some personal memories in here for me. I attended and was a spectator at many of these events, starting as a small boy visiting my GrandMother in New York. The section that describes the Lev Alburt victory at Jacksonville, Florida in 1990 is very personal for me. I was there in the audience, and I watched just about every game. (My Brilliancy Prize game for The U.S. Open that year can be found in just about every on-line database.) And - of course! - you get cross-tables from most or all of these events.<br />I do not think I can rate this book highly enough, nor do it any real justice in a small review.<br />Why would you buy this book? Certainly not to improve ... there are too many good teaching books - `The Complete Chess Player,' by Reinfeld; `My System,' by Nimzovich; \\"How To Re-Assess Your Chess,\\" by IM Jeremy Silman; The Watson or Alburt books, etc. Plus you could get several other books what you will pay for this one, especially if you are willing to buy a used book.<br />You would not buy this book if you are trying to raise your rating ... once again this is not a book really designed to do that. No!! Buy this book because you love the game and want a book that will be a permanent and lasting memory of all the great tournaments, and all the great players who played in them.

Are you a club player or a correspondence player and you are looking for a good line to play? Do you play in tournaments? Do you enjoy sharp and highly tactical chess? Do you want to study (and play?) one of the most exciting lines in all of chess opening praxis? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this book may be for you.<br />First let me say something about the quality of this book, since many times in chess books, this is &quot;iffy&quot; at best. First-rate flex-cover, opaque pages, very good and clear diagrams, indexes, a good font, the main lines are in bold, etc. (Gambit publications usually does a more than adequate job here.)<br />Secondly, I GREATLY enjoy the book. (I don't play these lines, a student purchased this copy for me so we could study the opening together.) It is very well laid out. There is an introduction where the author covers some of the basic ideas of the whole variation, from the endings, to general ideas, outposts, sacrifices in this variation etc. (This is an area missed by many chess books, especially books on the opening.)<br />The author then begins with the main line of this variation:<br />(Chapter One, 17. a3.) He covers all of these lines thoroughly and in great detail. Then there are ELEVEN! (11) chapters that cover virtually every line and every variation that this opening generally encompasses. Then you get a BONUS: The author covers the &quot;Moscow Variation.&quot; (Bg5, h6!?) This is a very close relative, but many books on the Botvinnik line DON'T cover the Moscow Variation, but Pedersen very thoughtfully has.<br />Most of the coverage in this book is excellent and in great depth. Virtually every line and every variation is covered in depth. Every player - from a weekend warrior, to the seasoned Master - will find the coverage in this book sufficient.<br />Now to a few things wrong with this book. NO player index. How are you supposed to find your favorite player? (There is a very detailed index of the variations, however.)<br />There are also NO deeply annotated games in this book. (In fact, almost no complete games of any kind.) Personally, if I am a `class player' trying to learn this opening, I would benefit greatly from 5-10 briefly annotated games at the end of each chapter.<br />The layout of the book is a little dense and the numbering of the variations is a little obscure. (A223, page # 95) Some of the analysis of a few of the sub-variations feature parenthesis within parenthesis ... and I have always found this a little hard to follow.<br />But despite my criticisms, this is a good book. It is MUCH superior to the average opening book on the market today, even the editor and proofreader of this project did a good job. (I found very few errors of any kind.)<br />If you play these lines in tournaments or postal chess, then you will simply HAVE to have this book. (If you don't, you are going to drop a lot of points to the people who do!)e is a very detailed index of the variations, however.)<br />There are also NO deeply annotated games in this book.

I have had this book for probably more than a year now. I have spent many hours perusing it ... and many, many more going over the games.<br />First a word on the quality of this book: It really is superb. A beautiful hard-back, soft pages that are opaque, and a binding that has stood up to being bent in half ... more times than I care to admit.<br />This book has virtually EVERY SINGLE GAME that the great Reshevsky ever played. Now Reshevsky is a true giant in American chess. He was one of the top players in this country from probably the late 1920's almost to the end of the 20th Century. He won the U.S. Championship many times ... and more tournaments than I care to count.<br />This book is as lovingly and painstakingly done as any I have ever seen. (Period!!! Unbelievable accuracy ... I have found no errors in this book - despite about 50 spot checks of various games.) You get the complete score of each game, as well as a lot of useful information that other books and databases leave out. (Like exact dates - not just the year. Plus round number, things of that sort.) You almost always get a cross-table for each event as well. (Its great fun to see who played in what event. Many of the people are the legends of chess; far too many are no longer with us.)<br />You also get quite a bit of biographical data. There is a lot of info here, enough for any chess hound or Reshevsky fan. There are nearly 2000 chess games, (1768); and much more useful features. You can find anything very easily the author has provided indexes by opponents, openings, and ECO code. Over 400 pages of interesting material.<br />What are the drawbacks to this book? Its pretty expensive, you could buy a dozen used books for what this one tome costs. It is also dense, I would have liked to see much more biographical data and info and stories on some of the individual tournaments. The large majority of the games are NOT annotated. Many of the notes are those that were lifted from various periodicals of the time when the games were played. (I would have liked to see the author at least take a stab at annotating a few games!)<br />OK ... so what's the bottom line here? Its a simple question: \\"If I have the money to spend, should I buy this book?\\" I think the answer is a resounding YES!! Why? I will give you a few reasons: # 1.) If you are a Reshevsky fan like me ... I saw him play in many U.S. Championships ... then you definitely want this book. # 2.) If you are a fan of the game and chess in general, then this is a great book. # 3.) Much of the material in here ... and the games themselves ... would have been surely lost to the sands of time without this book. # 4.) This is NOT a beginner's book ... but any beginner could surely benefit from a diligent study of this great Master's games. He was good in the opening, great in the middle-game, and simply fantastic in most endings!!! # 5.) Looking for a ... RESOURCE BOOK??? Put this on your shelf. There is more reference material here than you could ever use, and more chess games than most small {personal chess} libraries offer!! # 6.)

Hi, I am a Master, and for many years now I have made a living by teaching chess, lately all on the Internet. I also ask if you are seriously considering buying this book, that you stop and read all of the other reviews FIRST!<br />Don't be fooled by the four-star rating, the material in this book is super-outstanding. (The pages are somewhat see-through, the fonts are not the kind I prefer, and the diagrams are the old-style type that I don't care for ... they are too hard to see clearly.) And I almost never give a five-star rating anymore, I save that for the chess books that border on perfection. {A shrinking group, to be sure!}<br />One of the things you should know is that GM E. Geller was a VERY STRONG PLAYER!! (Maybe he belongs in the 100 strongest of all time!) He won the championship of the Soviet Union twice - one of these tournaments was (statistically) one of the strongest of that type ever held. He was a CANDIDATE for the World Championships ... SIX (6) TIMES!!!!! He had a PLUS (lifetime) score against many great players like Bobby Fischer! (Only Spassky proved to be his undoing, stopping him twice in the Candidate Matches to the tune of 2.5 - 5.5.)<br />Another important fact he was EXTREMELY rspected by his peers as both a theoretician AND a teacher. (Mikhail Botvinnik said of him: \\"Before Geller, we did not understand the King's Indian.\\")<br />He was also a hard working player who was an extremely industrious analyst. One player - whom I shall not name here - was very suspicious of others analysis, and trusted almost no one. But when he was given a piece of Geller's work, he took it at face value, and did not even bother to check it!!<br />So the only question that remains to us now is determine is this a good chess book, and does it have something worthwhile to offer?<br />I think the key here can be found in the title ... or HOW DO I APPLY CHESS THEORY??? (I have always been a theory hound, and if I had won all my games where I stood better out of the opening, I would have been a GM a long time ago!!)<br />In the intro to game # 30, Geller tells you: # 1.) About the Dragon; # 2.) How it got its name; # 3.) And the general procedure with which to tackle this tough line. His notes are extremely incisive, I do not see how anyone could not learn something if they were to apply themselves.<br />This is NOT a perfect book - but almost no chess book is! (I have studied all 100 of the games here. A small handful I have subjected to DEEP, computer-assisted analysis.) And as one gentleman already noted, this is NOT a beginner's book.<br />But consider this: # 1.) ONE HUNDRED very carefully annotated games; # 2.) MANY different opening lines; # 3.) Geller often tells you there are 2-3 good ways to meet certain lines, and which one may be best; # 4.) Things like openings, mid-game plans, and the technique for certain endings are discussed in GREAT detail.<br />I personally think that this book would benefit ANY player who fell into one of the following groups:  # 1.) Might be a fan of Geller's; # 2.) Is looking for s SERIOUS chess book, maybe one he (or she) could study for years!; # 3.) Is looking to model themselves after a very strong player; # 4.) Is looking to sharpen or improve your tactics. If you feel you belong in any of these groups, then this is a book for you. (But if you would characterize yourself as a lazy person, don't bother.)<br />My rating of the MATERIAL and game choice in this book would be outstanding, A+.

As long as you really want to work hard and have good study habits, I feel this could be a book that you could benefit from.

Last night I went to chess club and I received a copy as a gift. I stayed up for hours reading it. (And going over the games.) {I am a chess master that teaches chess (on the Internet) and builds chess sites.}<br />My impressions were as follows:<br />#1.) He claims the every first game to receive this prize was the game, Bird-Mason; 1876. (There were games before this that were mentioned as best games of various events.)<br />His analysis of that game is too critical. The game is very entertaining and quite brilliant - especially for that time period.<br />#2.) I checked several of his analysis versus dozens of copies of the \\"Informants.\\" Sometimes all he did was copy the analysis and notes, and maybe flesh them out with a few comments. His analysis is almost word-for-word copies of some analysis that appears in seveal issues of the NIC Year-book.<br />#.3) He gives all the games names, some show a sense of humor. Titles like: \\"Art Imitating Life,\\" and \\"Original Banality.\\" (an oxymoron)<br />I went over close to a dozen games, I found at least two  errors in the analysis. Some of the analysis is very critical of older games. He does NOT always give all the moves of a game, and I find this to be a drawback. He also greatly criticizes some older and well-known brilliancies, (like Bogolyubov-Alekhine, Hastings; 1922) but does not substantiate his criticisms. (In fact he is simply regurgitating analysis done by GM's like Nunn and Soltis, there seems to be little new work here.) He also gives several famous games that have been thought to be total FAKES ... (i.e., Botvinnik - Chekover); and does not even comment on this fact.<br />Having said all this, would I buy this book? The answer is yes. But let me give you a few reasons you should NOT buy this book: DON'T buy this book if you are looking for chess instruction, or to get better; DON'T buy this book if you hope it will improve your game. This is quite simply a book about the most brilliant games of chess ever played. (The annotations are nowhere near as instructive as a Nunn or Soltis book.) Now having said that, let me give the following qualification: If you purchased this book, and did a systematic study of these games, you would DEFINITELY improve your tactics. Some of these games are the best and most intense tactical 'free-for-alls' ever played.<br />This is really a book for a serious chess lover. Buy this book if you love chess, and would like a record of all of the most brilliant games ever played. If that is your rationale, then this would be a good book to get, and you could spend hundreds of enjoyable hours studying these exciting contests. This would also be a good reference book.

(First, please read the other review by Mr. Hart. Then read this one.)<br />What player revolutionized chess? What player found chess a chaotic game and left it nearly a science? Which player did more to advance the way that chess was played, perhaps more so than any other player who ever lived? Which player was the first to systematize the rules for the art of defense in chess? The answer to all of these questions is: Wilhelm Steinitz.<br />The &quot;rap&quot; on Steinitz today - from my dealings with players on dozens (!!) of Internet chess servers - is that he was a boring player  who could not play well. They also think he did not play interesting games and he could not play tactics. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. (His game with Bardeleben from Hastings, 1895; is considered by most experts to be one of the grandest games of chess ever played.)<br />If you want to read and own a book that was lovingly and carefully written by one of Steinitz's own descendants, then get this book. You will read an account of his life that is interesting, and was painstakingly checked for accuracy. In the back, you get about 20 games by GM A. Soltis, that are carefully annotated - with a completely new perspective. This is easily one of the highest quality books (and the most prized) in my entire collection.<br />If you want every chess game that Steinitz ever played, a good companion volume to this one is the collection of all his games, published by Sid Pickard of Dallas, TX.	2002-06-08

I used to have this book, I broke my own rules and lent it to a student and friend ... and he left Pensacola. (I never saw him, ... or the book again. But in his defense, he was in the Navy, and they move those guys around a lot.)<br />I also used to have an original copy of Marshall's book, but I have lost that over the years, too.<br />But the book is absolutely a treasure, I borrowed a friend's copy to do this review. (For accuracy's sake.)<br />I am too young to have known the man. (I played my first chess tournament in 1966.) But I knew Mr. Marshall's wife (Carrie) quite well. For many, many years; she was the lady who sat at the foot of the stairs and greeted you as you walked into the Marshall chess club. I feel very badly - I wish someone had told me who she was the first time I visited there. The Marshall's are a HUGE part of the history of the game of chess, at least here in the U.S.<br />What do you get when you buy this book? Quite simply one of the very best chess books ever written, at least in the area of a (chess) biography. It is very clear and very obvious that this book has been researched to a level I personally have never seen before.<br />By comparison, I am interested in history and very fascinated with several figures in history, notably Abe Lincoln and Andrew Jackson. (Among others.) I have read virtually every book I could get my hands on about these two persons ... and in the process I have found literally hundreds of mistakes. (One authors' chronological record itself was ridiculous, he had Jackson - MANY TIMES!! - in two different places at the same time!)<br />But in Soltis's book, I have yet to find a single error. This might be because Marshall himself left a tremendous amount of material behind. He wrote several books, kept journals, and filled literally hundreds of yellow legal pads with notes of his own. And the people who actually knew Frank Marshall told me he had a fabulous memory.<br />The former secretary of the club personally told me that Soltis spent hundreds and hundreds of hours there, pouring over records, making notes, and making copies of the material that is available there.<br />The result? A simply fabulous book that is virtually free of errors. I am NOT saying Andy made no mistakes, every human does. But Andy has worked VERY hard on producing a document/book that is about as error-free as any person could humanly try to do. Andy has gone well above and beyond the call of duty here.<br />\\"What about the book,\\" you say? Well, it too is beautiful. A gorgeous hard-back book that is nearly 400 pages in length. 220 very deeply annotated games. Additionally, there are DOZENS of game fragments.<br />Personally, I do NOT think you would buy this book if your only interest was to improve your game, there are simply too many other good books devoted to that subject. (Check out the books by Capa, Reinfeld, Watson and Yermolinsky.) No, you would buy this book for many reasons - maybe because you consider yourself a Marshall fan. Or you consider yourself a student chess history, and want to learn more. And maybe you think you might benefit from studying one of the greatest tactical players the USA ever produced.<br />All the bases are covered here. A thorough index, photo's, match and tournament record ... quite simply there is not a topic or subject here that you can't think of that Soltis has not covered in great detail. (On page # 203 you can find Marshall's famous victory over Levitsky, Breslau; 1912.)<br />The only topic that I could not find was the list of Marshall's best games; perhaps Soltis did not feel qualified to make that judgment. You have over 200 of Marshall's games here, so after playing through them all, you could do your own list. (My own choice would have to come from one of the games from his monumental win at Cambridge Springs, 1904.)<br />If you are a fan of Soltis, as I am ... or want to learn more about chess history, then get this book.

A fan (and an Inernet student) of mine recently sent me a copy of this book. He asked me to review it.

(Which I think is out of print ... a bloody shame, since this is a really great book!!)<br />The author carefully goes through the chess tournaments, (10 great and classic events, London, 1851 &amp; 1883; through San Antonio,  1972); and carefully tells you all about the event. You often get many of the best games, a crosstable, MANY fascinating and entertaining stories ... it IS the next best thing to being there.<br />There are DOZENS of games in here, carefully and well-annotated, in the style Andy is famous for. The mistakes are made clear, as well as many of the inside stories of the games themselves. (Where he got all this great stuff, I haven't a clue!!)<br />I have owned this book since 1975 or '76, I practically know it by heart. It is now a great resource, I refer to it often to annotate games.<br />Can I say anything bad about this book? Not really. The only valid knocks on this book are: A.) It is out of print, and B.) It is in descriptive notation. (Hint to the publisher!)<br />IF you love chess, and don't have a big library, you will enjoy this book. (IF .. you can get a copy!)	2002-04-01

I am a chess teacher, and have been one for a long time. I have many students, both locally and hundreds on the Internet.<br />If there were one book you could buy as a primer to the middlegame, this would have to be it.<br />Virtually every reasonable topic is tackled; most standard mid-game positions are covered. Keres shows you how to attack the King: when it is caught in the center; how to attack a King, based on an open file; how to weaken the King's enemy pawn cover to initiate an attack; how to use the 2 Bishops to attack your opponent's King; how to sacrifice to expose the King ... I could go on and on, but I trust by now you get the point. The positions were carefully chosen by the author, indeed they are probably the result of the famous 'Russian School' of chess.<br />Some of the material is slightly dated, but as a Master and a professional chess teacher, this makes little difference.<br />You should already know the 20-30 basic mating positions; Keres does NOT cover them here. (See D. Kopec's book, &quot;Practical MiddleGame Techniques,&quot; for these in detail.)<br />A word of warning, the book I just got (a local student purchased one copy for me and one copy for himself); is in descriptive notation. Many students are somewhat put off by this, indeed I think it is time for a good writer to bring out an algebraic edition of this book.<br />My experience is that the serious students who will apply themselves will definitely profit from this book. With almost no conditions! (I do NOT think the absolute beginner should tackle this book ... see my website for a list of books for each class of player. A real beginner should probably get &quot;Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess, &quot; first, and then Fred Reinfeld's, &quot;The Complete Chess-Player.&quot;)<br />This is one of my favorite books on the middle-game. IF you finish this book, and want more, Fine's book on the middlegame, and Euwe's book would be a good next step. (IF ... they are available!) Then you might be ready for GM Larry Christiansen's excellent book, &quot;Storming The Barricades,&quot; which is a fantastic book on this subject.<br />Overall this is probably the best single book on the middlegame, and I would have gladly awarded it five stars, if it were available in algebraic notation.you might be ready for GM Larry Christiansen's excellent book, &quot;Storming The Barricades,&quot; which is a fantastic book on this subject.<br />Overall this is probably the best single book on the middlegame, and I would have gladly awarded it five stars, if it were available in algebraic notation.	2002-02-16

This may be Mr. J. Watson's definitive chess book!<br />I have a friend who writes a very interesting and informative newsletter on lesser-used openings, and he (among others!) requested many times that I review this book.<br />First of all, I was a little intimidated by the title. The Nimzowitsch book, &quot;My System,&quot; is easily one of the greatest landmarks of all of chess literature. (See all the reviews of this great book to begin to appreciate just what a revolutionary book this really was. Many great GM's - such as Bent Larsen and Tigran Petrosian ... among the many more famous examples - have repeatedly said this was THE most influential book in their development as a player.) So to put yourself in such [literary] company at the very &quot;get-go,&quot; could be interpreted as a little assuming. (To say the least!)<br />I have had this book for around six months. I have read it through at least 3 times. I have studied certain sections over and over. Repeatedly. I have tried to &quot;punch holes&quot; in his ideas and his analysis. While I may have found one or two minor flaws in the analysis of certain lines, (which virtually undetectable to the average player, especially one who is not using a strong computer program to check every single move); I have found no major, fundamental flaws anywhere in this book. (I have also found almost no diagrams with the incorrect position.) The book is also well constructed - a sturdy flex-cover and pages that have a nice 'feel' to them.<br />An example of what you will find in this book? I will not give an overview of everything in the book, but just a sampling to whet your appetite. (The book is divided into two major parts.) Part 1, (&quot;The Refinement of Traditional Theory.&quot;):<br />Chapter One - Overview. Here Watson discusses some basic ideas of Middle-Game Theory. He shows what some of the basic concepts are and then some of the typical problems with 'standard' middlegame methodology.<br />Chapter Two, &quot;The Center and Development.&quot;<br />Here the author goes into quite some detail showing just how modern theory has evolved and developed since its conception.<br />Chapter Three, &quot;Minorities Majorities, and Passed Pawns.&quot;<br />Here the author examines all the ideas of these subjects. He shows exactly what conventional theory is, and then provides some fresh, new insights.<br />As I said, I am not going to cover the entire book, but give you just a brief glimpse of what you will discover in these pages.<br />By now you are wondering what I really thought of this book?<br />I think the best way to illustrate this point is by looking at a concrete example. Let us consider Part Two, Chapter Two; the section on &quot;Rule Independence.&quot; Here the author discusses in great detail virtually all of the basic ideas you have learned. He shows there are some very basic fallacies to virtually everything you have learned. For instance is a Rook really worth 5 points? What is the real value of the exchange? Do you really have to develop during the opening? I could rave on, but by now you should get the general idea. The author is determined to try to make you think for yourself.<br />Another strong point to this book is the author almost continually quotes other good chess books - I spent a lot of time digging various books out of my library to check his almost constant references to other famous (and not-so-famous) chess books.<br />Overall I think this is one of the very best chess books written in the last 50 years!! I personally recommend this book very strongly, and think it would make a great companion book to Silman's work, &quot;How To Re-Assess Your Chess.&quot; [3rd Edition.] I believe the author very completely and successfully sets out what he tried to do when he wrote this book. It more than lives up to the ambitious title.<br />WARNING: I personally feel this book is NOT suitable for an absolute beginner. (I am sure such a player could learn a great deal from this book, but I do not believe this is what the author intended.) In fact, I am quite sure you should not tackle this book unless you have been playing chess for at least one to two years, and have a rating of at least 14 - 1600. In addition, you should also - ideally - work your way through Nimzo's book first. (To better appreciate what is written here.)<br />The author very obviously assumes you are already familiar with the basics of chess. Many times he does not stop and explain all the standard ideas of a concept he is studying. I guess he [rightly so] assumes you have already read several chess books and are pretty familiar with the fundamentals of chess. I am quite sure the very raw, absolute beginner(s) ... and those that are not very experienced in chess ... will be almost completely overwhelmed by this book.<br />(Indeed, one of my students who had been playing chess on the Internet for around 7 months bought this book and basically got lost attempting to really grasp the ideas involved. He found Reinfeld's book, &quot;The Complete Chess-Player&quot; to be much more to his liking.)<br />But if you fit the description above, then GET THIS BOOK!itious title.<br />WARNING: I personally feel this book is NOT suitable for an absolute beginner.

I will give a very small extract from the book later, and you can judge for yourself.<br />I am a \\"Chess Pro\\" (A LIFE-Master), ... for over 5 years now I have made a living teaching chess ... both in person and lately - sometimes giving 3-7 lessons in a [good] day on the Internet. So my questions about this book were twofold: #1.) Is it a GOOD teaching vehicle? # 2.) Is it something the average chess player would benefit from?<br />Another hard consideration is there are dozens of chess books out there on the market today - all promising improvement. So why should I listen to this guy? (Especially when I could buy the series from Lev Alburt?) Well the answer is pretty simple, this guy is NOT a yutz: this is a [former] U.S. Champion who at one time had played in like 8 consecutive U.S. Championship events. He has won many large open tournaments in the USA and has even played very creditably on the International Chess scene. He is an extremely well known teacher and has written many respected articles for newspapers and magazines on chess. He is also a product of the highly vaunted \\"Soviet School\\" of chess - their teaching methods are well known and have produced all but one of the chess World Champions since Botvinnik.<br />I am not sure I agree with the layout of this book, I might have done it differently - but this is more of an ergonomic and stylistic remark than a valid criticism. There are sections on everything from the Benoni structure to advice on how to handle complex tactical positions. There is also some very frank and extremely instructive advice and commentary on some of the endgames.<br />In the introduction the author tells you that this book is, \\"essentially a collection of A. Yemolinsky's games and analysis.\\" (In the Introduction.) So the only question remains did he come through on the two basic questions that I posed above?<br />Well, a good question to see would be to find one of my own weaknesses and see if the author could help me in this area? The answer was yes.<br />On page 51, we find an extremely detailed explanation - and the beginning of a whole section of analysis - on, \\"The Burden Of Small Advantages.\\" (Steadily converting a small ad vantage is an area I have had a lot of problems with.) Here is an extract, I have started with near the end of one paragraph, and the start of another, simply to make a point.<br />&lt;&lt; they are described as 'plus over equal' in chess literature; and that's the most popular evaluation we find in Opening Books -\\"White is slightly better.\\"<br /> The positional theory of Steinitz - Tarrasch teaches us (as generations of chess players before) to attack when we are better, otherwise the advantage will disappear - some sort of 'use it or lose it' advice. And we should follow it ... >> VERY good words!<br />(The author has a dialogue that runs well over one whole page, see the sample pages if you would like more examples of the author's style of writing.)<br />The next few examples I found to be VERY illustrative - and both entertaining and instructive. I went over them many times, one time playing the main lines out on a big chess board, and looking at the side-lines on a small wooden peg board ... AND a magnetic set. The first example (in this section) is Adelman - Yermolinsky. He shows how White, (who is a very strong player); took a very seemingly equal and harmless position - with almost no visible weaknesses - and went on to lose. I think I learned a great deal from this section. But the real question is not whether he can teach a chess pro; but whether or not the average player would find this book of any real instructional value.<br />I took one of the examples- with a diagram - copied it, word-for-word; (with a few sparse comments from me); and sent it out to dozens of my friends and students. (Both on the Internet and in the U.S. Mail.) I also asked as many people about this book (esp. in person, at a chess tourney); as I could. The responses were overwhelmingly positive. A medical doctor - who is currently the Pensacola Chess Club's president; felt this was a great book. A player in Tallahassee, FL said, \\"This is a GREAT book, one anyone could learn from.\\" A player from Kansas, whom I teach on the Internet, said, \\"This was - without a doubt - the best chess book I had ever read.\\" (!!) A player from Mobile, AL (who attends college there), called this, \\"A VERY good instructional book!\\" Of the nearly 30 players who responded, only 1 \\"Class D\\" player said, \\"This is probably good stuff, but I felt it was a little over my head.\\"<br />My honest take on this book is that it is a VERY good teaching book. I would give it an 8.5, on a scale of one to ten. I also think it is like one of Shrek's onions, it has MANY layers. I.e., I feel almost any player who applied themselves seriously to this book, (a 6-12 month study course); would show DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT! My only criticism is that a very inexperienced or lower-rated player would be a little lost with this book.

But this is THE book to buy if you play the Pirc. Players ABOVE 1900 will find it VERY useful.<br />(Why don't they ever put diagrams in a book from Black's side or perspective? I think there should be TWO versions of a book like this, one for a WHITE Pirc Player, and one for a BLACK Pirc Player!)<br />An overall nine out of a possible 10!<br /><br />(09/2002) Addendum: I now have had this book for probably more than 6 months. (Several fans sent me a copy.) None of my original comments have changed. This is still THE book for the player who wants to play this line. ESPECIALLY if you are planning to play this line in postal or tournament chess!!<br /><br />There are literally DOZENS of good things about this book, LOTS of explanations, in depth discussions of the tactical and strategic plans. (Etc.) This makes this an opening book SEVERAL levels above average!! It is even a good teaching vehicle! But it is also somewhat dense, several persons have e-mailed me and told me players below a certain rating (say 13-1500) may have a lot of difficulty understanding this treatise.<br /><br />Now for the few drawbacks to this book. It is VERY much slanted to the player who wishes to play the BLACK side of this line, players of the White pieces will find themselves wondering where certain lines are covered. EXAMPLE: Let's start with the Austrian Attack. (Page # 213.) After the moves: 1.e4, d6; 2.d4, Nf6; 3.Nc3, g6; 4.f4, Bg7; 5.Nf3. Players of the White pieces would hope to find 5...0-0; covered in detail. But you WON'T! Why not? The authors simply pass over this move and recommend Black play 5...c5. Now this move IS covered in GREAT detail .... the authors have left almost no stone uncovered in their comprehensive analysis of these variations. But again, what if you are trying to learn these lines from the White side? (Simple answer: Better have MCO or NCO on the shelf!)<br /><br />This scenario is repeated over and over. The writers of this book - top GM's who play this line - are telling you to play the lines  that they play. (Kinda makes sense, don't it?) But again, players of the White side of the board are left out in the cold.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but by now - I trust you get the point. Any player who wants to play (and really learn) the Black side of this difficult and uncompromising defence has got to buy this book. Players on the other side of the board - who play these lines - will also need this book; if for no other reason ... to see what lines Alburt and Chernin recommend to the 2nd player, and to plan their repertoire accordingly.<br /><br />Any player (like me), expecting in depth and and encyclopedic coverage in a book that is 448 pages ... will be a little dissapointed.book - top GM's who play this line - are telling you to play the lines  that they play.

When asked by the editor of the Georgia State Chess Magazine to review the new book on the Modern Benoni by Kinsman, I thought this must have been fate &iexcl;K or a fortuitous - even a very serendipitous - event.<br />You see I am a Master and I teach chess professionally. And the Benoni was one of the very first openings I ever studied in depth. I must have close to 30 books and pamphlets on the Benoni that I have gathered over the years. (Like the book, Modern Benoni Dynamics [hard-back], by Steffen Zeuthen. ¶ 1976. I am told this is now something of a collector's item.)<br />I first played the Benoni as a lower-rated player in the 70's. Eventually I gave it up as, &quot;too complex,&quot; but later came back to it as a Master, (in the 1980's); on the advice of GM D. Gurevich. (He told me to have something very complex and double-edged to play against lower-rated players.)<br />I still use this opening too - indeed I crushed a very strong master (2435 ELO) with this opening in one of the &quot;Dos Hermanos/ICC (Internet) Qualifying Tournaments&quot; earlier this year. (I do not give the game, as it is basically a blitz game and a relatively routine [Benoni] affair.)<br />Upon first examining this book, you note that it is definitely well made - like all books from this publisher. (EVERYMAN Chess.) The bindings are securely sewn and glued in, and very sturdy. (Unlike some other chess books!) The &quot;flex-cover&quot; is thick and very durable. The pages are relatively opaque, (with little bleed-through); supple, and are acid-free. The ink used in the print is clear and bold and does not run if it becomes wet.<br />(I also want to comment here on the publisher. Everyman Press probably has the highest standards of any modern-day publisher of chess-books. They obviously have editors, typesetters and proofreaders who at least know the moves of the game! And this was NOT true of publishers of chess books in the past.)<br />The material is neat, clear, and very well organized. There are 10 chapters in three main sections. Just about every line that one could expect to have played against you is covered. The Sections are based on the opening variations, consisting of a total of 64 complete, well-annotated games presenting the material. (Approximately 145 total pages.)<br />The blurb on the back cover reads: &quot;The Modern Benoni (1. d4, Nf6; 2. c4, c5; 3. d5, e6;) is one of Black's most dynamic Queen's Pawn Openings. From the third move, Black strives to create a permanent imbalance in the pawn structure, with exciting results. Both players must be utterly fearless in carrying out their plans; in the Benoni he who hesitates, is lost!&quot;  Truer words were never spoken. I would also like to add that this is a razor-sharp line and anyone who fears intense tactical battles should probably avoid it like the plague!<br />h IM Andrew Kinsman is a well-known player and trainer; who is an expert on the Benoni. He remains very objective; as we see one of his wins in this book, and then one of his losses.<br />Section One covers the &quot;Main Lines,&quot; (Classical) including the tricky lines that use an early h3 by White. Section Two covers The Four Pawns and the Mikenas Attacks, The &quot;Flick-Knife&quot; Variation, (The Taimanov); The Modern or Samisch Variation, (White pawn to f3); and other systems - such as the oddball line that GM Seirawan often employs. (Bd3 &amp; Nge2). Section Three covers the lines that avoid an early e2-e4 by White. (The &quot;Knight's Tour&quot; Variation by White.) This section also covers the line that features the use of an early Bf4 by White. This line was extremely popular in tournament praxis just a few years ago.<br />When I first got the book, I tried to go through it in great detail. (Indeed, I have been through the book, cover-to-cover; many times!) I pulled up about a dozen games up on my database [program] and checked the game scores for accuracy. I then had my daughter pick out 4 gamesat random. (She chose - Games # 1, # 4, # 23, # 54.) I went over every move, note and line of these 4 games many, many times. I looked for: errors in analysis, misprints, and diagrams that have the incorrect position. I found no mistakes of this type.<br />(But upon going through the book again later, I did discover that the diagram at the bottom of page # 14 has the  wrong position.  I also refer you to page # 56 of game # 23. {Lautier - Sutovsky; Tillburg, 1996.} In the variation after 22&iexcl;KRxd5?; Kinsman writes: &quot;Plaskett points out the major improvement 22&iexcl;KRc7!; 23. d6, Rcc8; 24. Bg4, Rcd8; 25. Bxd7, Rxe5!; (Lautier only considered 25&iexcl;KRxd7; 26. Nc5)  26. Bg4, f5; (&quot;-/+&quot;) and Black is winning. The game move results in a very advantageous ending for White.&quot;  This is all basically true. But the first thing to note is that the move 24. Bg4?!, is vastly inferior to 24. Nf6+, which I found almost straightaway. After  24. Nf6+, Nxf6; 25. exf6, Bxf6; 26. d7, Rxe1+; 27. Rxe1, Rd8; 28. Re8+, Kg7; 29. RxR/d8, Bxd8; 30. Bb7, and White has a very large, if not a winning advantage. The other thing I want to point out in this variation, is that 26. Bg4 may not be the best move, again. It seems that<br />26. Rac1(!?) may be slightly better. I could show you more lines and variations of this type. But I won't as that simply would be showing off. My main point of this foray is: # 1.) Don&iexcl;¦t ever take anything at face value; #2.) No one's analysis is air-tight, improvements can always be found if one is willing to search; and # 3.) You must be willing to work very hard to really learn an opening. {I also wonder whether or not IM Kinsman uses a computer and a good chess analysis-engine to check all of his work.} And to be honest, many of these finer points - especially to the  average  player - may seem like so much splitting of hairs.)<br />The next thing I did was to take out my many other books on this opening and make a list and see if all the pertinent lines were covered. And they are! In short just about everything you might need or want in a book of this type is here. A special bonus is the introduction. Here the author gives an over-view of the variations, including the fact that he examines - in detail! - the four main pawn breaks of this opening. He also considers what type of pawn structures may arise from such moves, and what the advantages and disadvantages of each formation are. (I wish chess books had done all this 25 years ago. It probably would have taken me a lot less time to become a Master if they had!! I cannot stress enough how important it will be to study this section if you purchase this book!) Another plus is the summary and a &quot;schematic&quot; at the end of each chapter. (The author tells you what lines are played and in which games you can find the analysis of these lines.) In addition to this, there is a very fine table of contents with a lot of useful information, and a very complete index of the complete games in the back of the book.<br />The games and the analysis are modern, there are very few &quot;dinosaurs&quot; present here. The author also incorporates a great deal of material into some of the games, so that virtually every possible line is thoroughly covered. Additionally, the author always conveniently points out where a certain variation is analyzed, so you should never be lost or groping about to find where your favorite continuation is examined. I would also like to point out that GM Topalov is the hero of this book, as he champions our defense many times with the Black pieces. References to his games are found throughout this entire book. (Hats off to the American Nick DeFirmian, he has also been a fairly regular adherent of this opening.)<br />There is very little, if anything &quot;wrong&quot; with this book. I would advise the average player to purchase MCO-14 in addition to this book. But since this is what I advise  ALL  my students, this doesNOT  even amount to a real criticism of the author or this book!<br />I do wonder about the choice of games. By pulling up all the lines in my database, with the ECO codes A70/00 to A79/99; using 2400 ELO as a cut-off point; it pulls up nearly 3000 games. When I sort these according to the average rating of both players, one begins to notice a few things that are relative to this book. The game with the two highest-rated participants would be Karpov-Topalov; Las Palmas 1996. (That game is in this book.) But many others, such as A. Karpov - G. Kamsky; (The FIDE World Championships, Elista, Russia; [#15] 1996.) are not in this book. Since the author does not tell us how he arrived at his criterion for selecting games, (Most chess authors DO NOT give this information either.); we are left to wonder. But I will say that ALL the main lines are well covered, and there is really no need to worry on this front.

AND on Soltis's list, please visit my web page devoted to \\"The (All-Time) Best Games of Chess Ever Played,\\" at ...)<br />The author made a very large list of over 7,000 games, (!) then narrowed this list down to around 300 games, and then winnowed it down to the best 100 - using come of the most exacting criteria and the most rigorous research data I have ever seen used for chess games.<br />He graded the games according to the following criteria: (On a scale of 1 to 20!)<br /># 1.) Overall Aesthetic Quality.<br /># 2.) Originality.<br /># 3.) Level of Opposition.<br /># 4.) Soundness, Accuracy, Difficulty.<br /># 5.) Breadth and Depth.<br />Now I will not give you his list of the ten best chess games here. (You can see which games he picked on my web site and see a discussion of that list there.); But I will tell you I have problems with his list. (And his methodology. See below.) For instance, he rejects Adams - Torre, (New Orleans, 1920.); as a possible fabrication. I think this is unfair and an unproven accusation. (I personally like that game very much and would probably place it in one of the prettiest games ever played. It's maybe THE game for exploiting a weak back-rank.)<br />He also dismisses 2 other games as fakes, and they probably are. (Alekhine's infamous 5-Queen game vs. N. Grigoriev is positively, absolutely a fake. And there are strong enough suspicions about Botvinnik - Chekover; Moscow, 1935 - to disqualify it as well.)<br />He also considers postal games together with regular, over-the-board chess, and I have a slight objection to that, as it is like comparing apples and oranges. He also blows off some other pretty good games, such as Nimzovich's \\"Immortal Zugzwang Game,\\" which was a personal favorite of mine. And he tosses several others for lacking \\"breadth and depth.\\" (Games like Spassky - Petrosian; Game # 19, World Champ. Match, 1969. Or Keres - Botvinnik; USSR Absolute Championship Tournament, 1941. Both of these games, IMOHO, deserve to be in the, \\"100 Most Beautiful Games of All Time.\\") And upon reflection, I must admit that some of his criticisms are valid in certain cases. But overall, his list is interesting, yet in a way - controversial. But when a writer of Soltis's stature picks a list like this, you have to pay attention. (And I will also admit to being a big fan of Andy's.)<br />METHODOLOGY: A note on Andy Soltis's methodology. At first glance, it would be easy to look at this book, and assume that GM Soltis was very objective. But upon deeper examination, there are MANY problems with the methods that he used. For instance, he had five categories, and he numbered these from 1-20. But what were the exact criteria used? Logically, the larger the gap, the more open to interpretation the numbers are. I might grade a game as an \\"18\\" for originality. Soltis might give the same game a score of only 15. (Or much less!) I would have chosen a much smaller bandwidth, with a very exact criterion. For instance, \\"10\\" might be \\"GM opposition with above average defense.\\" A \\"9\\" might be \\" a GM opposition with only average defense.\\" Etc. If Soltis had been more exact in his criteria or further elucidated what his standards were, then we would know more - and have a greater confidence - in the choices that he made. As it is, I think his choices are as subjective as the next person. The only thing that gives his choices any weight at all is the name of the author. And I do not believe that is enough. Personally, I have much more confidence in the methods used by Nunn, Emms, and Burgess in their list. (See my web page on this topic.)<br />Some ofthe games that many others consider as the best of all time are left completely off of GM Soltis's list. If you are going to have a major problem with that, then maybe you should consider not getting this book.<br />[another] One of the nice things about Soltis's book? He goes into great detail about some of the other efforts to define the best games. He also has a very nice list of the \\"Near-Misses,\\" (Games other authors may have - or may not have - ranked very highly. All very thoroughly annotated.) And some of the \\"Most Over-Rated Games.\\" (Games Soltis considers being not worthy of the best games list.)<br />But in the long run, you can argue over the choices all you like. In the end, you would still have to ask yourself, is this book worth the money I am going to pay for it? And the answer is a resounding yes!! You would NOT buy this book to learn OR improve. BUT ... you would definitely do BOTH if you purchased this book and carefully played through all the games contained within. No, buy this book because you love the game, and are curious to see what the author picks as the \\"100 Most Beautiful Games of the 20th Century.\\" You will be informed, entertained and delighted as only few authors can.

Before we go any further, I want you to know I am a Chess Master and I teach chess for a living.<br />All my students who have purchased this book have loved it.<br />All the great teachers of the game (GM L. Evans, SM Ken Smith, IM Silman, GM Soltis, GM Alburt; etc.) say you must FIRST master tactics before you can do anything else. This is the MANDATORY first step in the game of chess.<br />The best way to learn and master TACTICS is to study the OPEN GAMES. In my own opinion, there is no better way to do this than to study the games of Paul Morphy very carefully. (I personally believe Morphy was - easily - the greatest chess player who ever lived. See my web page on &quot;The Greatest Chess Players&quot; for more details.)<br />The games in this book are well written and easily understood by any class of player. The author did a great job here, and this probably remains the best book - dollar for dollar - on Morphy.<br />And in case you think these moves are easy to find, I once tested some of these moves on a GM ... who was approximately 18 months away from winning the U.S. Championship ... and he failed to find some of the moves that Morphy found quickly and easily!<br />The story in here is good, the games are great. Paul Morphy's games are the best vehicle for mastering the basics of chess. They are also very beautiful.<br />If you buy this book AND play through a few of the games - I personally guarantee you will not be disappointed with it. (And if you are, you can sell it on e-bay for almost what you paid for it.)<br />Come on! What else do I have to say? I make all my students study Morphy. I promise you will get better.

And this reminds me of those ads on TV late at night. All these weight and exercise programs ... but very few that actually work.<br />What is the secret of getting better? Studying tactics. (All the great chess teachers pretty much agree on this point.) But it has to be in a way that is proven, 'do-able,' fun, and not too terribly difficult. Otherwise it will be like that expensive exercise machine you bought, used once (!) ... and now it sits somewhere in a forgotten corner gathering dust.<br />Here then, is a study program for you to use. You can start at the front of the book and work your way through. You can jump around. You can do a few here and a few there. But however you do it, you will have fun. My advice? Work you way through this book 3-4 times, like several of my students. See if your game does not improve!<br />If you like this book, (and it works for you) then I recommend the puzzle book by Emms. You should also get &quot;Bobby Fischer's Outrageous Chess Moves,&quot; also by Pandolfini. The Polgar book. And of course the two most proven puzzle books of all time.

US	50708211	R3GP5PZ2KFIRXA	0713480092	648352129	Winning Pawn Structures	Books	5	47	51	N	N	The Manual on "How To Win Isolated-QP Positions."	This is easily one of the best and most carefully crafted books written in the last 50-100 years on the subject. It is easily THE book on isolated QP formations.<br />Before I go any further, you should know I am a LIFE - Master at chess, and that I teach chess to make a large part of my living.<br />How I got this book is a little story in itself. It was a gift from my good friend Sig, who is a bookseller from Tallahassee. He gave it to me as a gift, and it is even personally autographed by the author. At first I just glanced at it, and threw it down in my \\"books to read\\" pile.<br />Then one day, (a couple of months later); I just happened to pick it up and start reading. I was immediately and totally engrossed. I worked my way through like the first 3 chapters before I could even put it down.<br />I eventually went through the entire book. I was already familiar with many of the games in this book, but I found the analysis to be new, refreshing, and informative. The author even found many new ideas that I was not familiar with or had not seen before. (For example, see the analysis of the classic game: Boleslavsky - Kotov; Zurich Candidates Tournament, 1953 ... on page 15 of the book.)<br />A common assumption is that only players who play the Queen-Pawn Openings need to study this book, as the positions with the IQP only result from these types of openings. Nothing could be further from the truth. A position containing an Isolated QP is the natural result of dozens of different opening variations. For example, an IQP could result from any of the following variations: The Queen's Gambit, (Accepted & Declined); Tarrasch Defense, (to the Queen's Gambit); Reti Opening. The IQP also can arise from a French Defense, and is the natural result of many variations of the Panov-Botvinnik Variation of the Caro-Kann Defense. I could go on and give you a dozen more examples, but by now you should realize that either White or Black can get an IQP, and these formations can result from almost any opening.<br />This book was a major revelation to me. Having grown up under the influence of Nimzovich, I had mostly assumed that the positions containing an Isolated Queen's-Pawn, like any isolated pawn; was weak and should be avoided at all costs. (I almost never allowed myself to be saddled with an IQP, mostly as a result of what I had learned from Nimzowitsch's \\"My System.\\") This is a fallacy. For instance, take the 1974 Karpov-Korchnoi Candidates Match played in Moscow. (This match was won by Karpov by the slimmest of margins - 3 wins to 2, and was the de facto World Championship Match . . . since Fischer did not play in 1975.); Black seven times allowed himself to be given an Isolated Queen's Pawn, always equalized and never lost.<br />This book shows ALL the \\"do's and the don'ts\\" of this type of structure. The author has carefully and meticulously laid down virtually every aspect of the positions that contain an isolated Queen's Pawn.<br />The book is laid out in many chapters in three main parts. Part One discusses the advantages of the IQP. For instance, in Chapter 1 the author examines the energetic freeing advance d4-d5. In Chapter 2, we see the  repeated motif  of a sudden and unexpected attack on the f2 or f7-squares. In Chapter 3, we see the oft-repeated tactic of a Rook luft on the King-side. And on it goes. Seven chapters in the first part of the book, all focusing on ideas that appear constantly and repetitively in positions with an Isolated QP. In Part Two, (which is dedicated to the disadvantages of the IQP); Chapter 8; the author examines the strengths AND weaknesses of the isolani in every type of endgame that could have arisen from these types of positions, or has arisen in praxis. In Chapter 9, the author poignantly demonstrates when and where the IQP becomes weak in the average middle-game position. In Chapter 10, he shows the best methods for dealing with the Isolated QP. The Third Part of this book discusses all aspects ofassociated pawn structures. The author shows what types of positions can lead to an IQP, and when you should embrace them and when you should avoid them.<br />There are many other facets of this book that I find outstanding. The author uses many, many complete and well-annotated games to make his point. (It has always been my belief and teaching that whole games are the best vehicle to really learn the game of chess.) There are exercises at the end of each of the three sections of this book, for you to test and hone your new skills and knowledge. There are also many areas where the author will stop and elaborate  ALL  the ideas of a given position, so one cannot help but to learn (and be entertained) by such a narrative. All-in-all, I find this to be an above average chess book. I found almost no flaws in this book, and I found much information that even a Master of the game (like myself!) could learn and profit from!<br />This book receives my highest recommendation and praise. One can only hope this is the first book in a series on certain pawn patterns, and the author will continue (in the future) to educate us in the correct play of pawn structure and the proper way to play various pawn formations.<br />If you are trying to better learn and understand pawn structure, I can also recommend several other books, in the following order:  #1.) \\"My System,\\" by Nimzovich;  #2.) \\"Pawn Structure Chess,\\" by Andy Soltis;  and  #3.) \\"Pawn Power In Chess,\\" by Hans Kmoch.<br />One other tip?....<br />If you are trying to learn - or master pawn play &#8230; THEN GET THIS BOOK!!!<br />(Warning: If you are a raw beginner, then this book may not help you much and would be something of a difficult read.

I teach chess for a living. I first read this book close to 30 years ago.<br />This is a great book. A tremendous teaching vehicle. MANY of my students (AND people I have chatted with on various chess servers) have said this book helped them a lot!! But in actual application, it can be difficult to always do what the author advises.<br />A few fairly minor criticisms. The organization of this book is somewhat dicey. He uses too many fancy terms that I guess he just sort of made up &quot;on-the-fly.&quot; And he sometimes can be too repetitive. And several of my students said the descriptive notation version of this book was a little difficult for them to read.<br />But the final verdict is that the basic premise of this book is brilliant. He basically shows you some of the the most common chess mistakes that the average player might make. And this more than makes up for any of the books minor flaws.

And its not just esoteric knowledge. Yasser gives you many of the openings he personally plays. This is a proven commodity based on one of the more successful players this country has had over the last 20 years.

If you would like to see a book of some of the games of a great player, you may be interested in this book. But a few words of warning first.<br />#1.) This book came out BEFORE Kramnik won the chess World Championship, so already it is a little dated.<br />#2.) This is some of the dryest text you may ever see in your life. (Few, if any good stories.) In fact, if you suffer from insomnia, this may be a good book for you. I also get the impression that Kramnik either accepted factually that he was very talented, or he is one of the most conceited individuals on the face of the earth.<br />#3.) Many of the Soviet books are \\"ghost-written\\" by other chess players - trainers, analysts and such. I get the impression that this is what happened here. (A few of the errors in analysis are too basic to have been perpetrated by Kramnik. Indeed, I. Damsky is probably responsible for the majority of this book.)<br />Having given the above harsh criticisms, you may get the idea that I hate this book. This is simply not the case. I am a Master who makes a great part of his living from teaching chess. I consider it my responsibility to give as an honest review of every chess book as I possibly can. I also feel it my duty to reflect what many of my students and contacts on the Internet have told me about this book.<br />If you are looking for a book with some of the best annotations by a top player available, this would be a good book for you to choose. (Many of the annotations are gleaned from magazines where Kramnik had a direct hand in reviewing the games.)<br />What this book lacks in great stories, and perhaps quality, it makes up for in quantity. You get almost 200 deeply annotated games by the current World Champion. You will get one of the most COMPLETE chess educations available in one book by carefully studying ALL of these games.

And that I teach chess for a living.<br />The author, GM Larry Christiansen is, and has been one of the U.S.'s top players since the late 70's. He is a [former] U.S. Champion and is a feared competitor and attacker.<br />This is one of the better books written on this subject. The best way to go about learning HOW to attack, is to study some of the best attacks at the Master level and have a great player explain the game in thorough detail.<br />I purchased this book several months ago, and I have spent a great deal of time studying it BEFORE I wrote this review. (I spent 4 hours on one example alone!)<br />There are sections for each different kind of attack. The Chapters are illuminating in and of themselves. 1.) Evolution of an Attacking Player. 2.) Attack: General Considerations. 3.) Ripping apart the King position. 4.) King Hunting. 5.) How NOT to Attack. {Common ways to botch an attack.)  6.) Seizing Opportunities. 7.) Creating and Exploiting weaknesses. 8.) L.C.'s 11 Favorite attacking games of the 1990's. (Plus 1 last Tal game.) This last Chapter alone makes the book worth the amount you will pay for it!<br />The following discussion is found on page 29: &quot;The early examples illustrate mainly garden variety, standard attacking themes. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of quick development and efficient mobilization of the attacking forces. Time is of the essence! Rapid mobilization of overwhelming force against a weakness in the enemy camp, whether it be an exposed King or series of weak squares; is a KEY factor in basic successful attacking play.&quot; Well written, and words that any beginner should be able to grasp.<br />I might offer a few minor criticisms of this book. It could have been better organized. The emphasis on modern games ignores some of the more classic games that illustrate the same points as well as the modern games. But all these points are trivial. This book is destined to become one of the all-time great books on tactics and attack.<br />I would complement the study of this book with solving a few problems per day of tactical puzzles.

US	50708211	R1P1VJ5Z7FB6QP	1857442369	154748279	Improve Your Opening Play	Books	3	22	24	N	N	A good manual, but ONLY for beginners.	This is a great little book, but like so many that I see nowadays, there are certainly pros and cons to this book. (And you should know that I teach chess for a living.)<br />First off this is one of the newer books by &quot;EVERYMAN Chess.&quot; This is a fairly high-quality series of books. The publisher's books have several characteristics that will stand out: The books have a very thick and sturdy &quot;Flex-cover&quot; binding. (If it's not a hard-back, and this one is not.) The pages are thick and high quality, with little bleed-through. These chess books also have a very sturdy binding, unlike many of the other chess books on the market today. (Read the reviews of &quot;The Life &amp; Games of Mikhail Tal,&quot; to see what I am talking about.) The books also must have a first rate proofreader, as I have yet to find an error in spelling, grammar, or even a diagram that has an incorrect position. (These types of errors used to plague the chess book market.) So the overall quality of the books from this publisher are generally must higher than is the average for a chess book.<br />Now not to argue with the other gentleman who wrote a review here, but this book has definite limitations.<br />First off, the basic premise of this book is brilliant. To have a GM sit down and tell you the basic ideas of an opening and lead you through a few of the pertinent variations is a wonderful idea. I am sure many beginners would think this is a very good concept. Especially helpful are the &quot;warnings&quot; (accompanied by a skull and crossbones) and the &quot;tips.&quot; (Accompanied by a light bulb.) Here you do see a lot of the more useful &quot;Do's and Don'ts&quot; of any opening given. Chris Ward does explain the basic concepts of the openings covered.<br />But it stops short of being a real opening manual. The student really trying to learn any opening will still need to buy this book, maybe a &quot;how-to&quot; book on the opening they want to play AND MCO-14. For instance, the basic coverage of the Caro-Kann stops on the fourth move. True, he does carry on the discussion of this opening in an exercise. But still, the coverage of many of the openings discussed in this book stops around move 5-8. Another deficiency I noticed was a lot of verbiage on various topics, but no real discussion of the general middle-game plans. (For instance, in the King's Indian Defense, White plays on the Q-side and Black plays on the K-side. This is dictated by the pawn structure.)<br />A simple solution to this problem would have given at least the main line of each variation, stopping where the average opening compendium stops. This would have only added a few pages to this book and would have greatly enhanced the value of it.<br />If you are an absolute BEGINNER, or you are trying to learn an opening for the first time, I can recommend this book. But the average tournament player will still wind up buying MCO in addition to this book.r instance, the basic coverage of the Caro-Kann stops on the fourth move. True, he does carry on the discussion of this opening in an exercise. But still, the coverage of many of the openings discussed in this book stops around move 5-8. Another deficiency I noticed was a lot of verbiage on various topics, but no real discussion of the general middle-game plans. (For instance, in the King's Indian Defense, White plays on the Q-side and Black plays on the K-side. This is dictated by the pawn structure.)<br />A simple solution to this problem would have given at least the main line of each variation, stopping where the average opening compendium stops.

He was, by his own self-admission sometimes prone to tactical oversights ... especially after a long lay-off from chess. But yet he could play at a level few other GM's could match. Why was this?<br />A friend gave me a book on Botvinnik several years ago and encouraged me to study this great player. And while he may not have been the greatest tactician to ever play the game, he did something few players did. He was a magnificent planner.<br />He had a short-term plan, a medium range plan, and a long term plan for any position. Sometimes, he had a plan within a plan, within a plan. In fact, he could plan circles around the average GM.<br />This book contains a few errors in analysis. Its not organized as well as it could be. The opening are somewhat dated. Yet I could recommend this book to nearly any chess player wanting to improve his game. The games are thoroughly explained and very well annotated. If you are not a tactician who sees every shot, perhaps you could learn to plan like Botvinnik. Your game will definitely improve after reading this book. Learn the iron logic of the man who inspired entire generations of Soviet schoolboys to play chess.	2001-04-21

(\\"Chess Fundamentals,\\" by J.R. Capablanca.)<br />First, it might be good for you to read most of the reviews on this page if you are seriously considering purchasing this book. You should also know I a Chess Master, and I teach chess for a living.<br />IF you are a relative beginner, then this would be a GREAT first book for you!! (You should probably read \\"Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess\\" first, if you are a raw beginner who is just learning the game.)<br />This book has two parts. Part One is instruction in six separate chapters. Part two contains 14 illustrative games.<br />Most of what is in this book is simply outstanding. (A little of the material in this book is over-simplified and a little hackneyed. But it is still stuff you need to know if you are taking your first steps in chess.)<br />Chapter One covers all of the simpler, basic mates. It covers pawn promotion and endings. There are a few examples of some very simple ideas of methods to win in the middle-game. There is a discussion of the relative value of the pieces, the general strategy of the opening, and a little bit on the importance of controlling the center.<br />Chapter Two covers \\"Further Principles in Endgame Play.\\" Chapter Three covers the Middle-game and how to win in that phase of the game. Chapter Four is general theory. Chapter Five is \\"Endgame Strategy.\\" (This Chapter is very valuable. I have tested these positions on all categories of players. MANY MASTERS CANNOT CORRECTLY SOLVE THE ROOK & PAWN ENDINGS that are given here!) And Chapter Six covers, \\"Further Openings and principles.\\"<br />And as I said earlier, Part TWO covers 14 well-annotated games by Capablanca. The discussions in this part are in great detail and very well-explained. (I believe going over a COMPLETE game that is carefully annotated may be one of the best teaching tools there is, especially for the beginner!!)<br />I taught a young man for a while on the Internet during the year 2000. He was fairly young and had been playing Tournament chess for over two years without much improvement. His dad told me he thought he needed more basics. I had him read and study this book IN GREAT DETAIL. He and his Father went over every word and every variation. The process took several months to complete. When they got finished, they went back through the entire book again!! [His Dad said the young man in question had virtual memorized the 14 annotated games!] The bottom-line? The young man in question had increased his rating close to 300 points in a single year!!! (This is a very significant increase.)<br />Now while I cannot promise you that kind of improvement, I CAN guarantee that you will learn a tremendous amount. This book is so good, I may require ALL my beginning students to get and read this book. 'Nuff said?e year 2000.

This was the ONLY book mentioned by ALL of the players I talked to. Enough said? I think so!<br />Its also one of the few books you can read without a chess board handy! (Diagrams aplenty.)<br />03/01/2002 I decided to add something to this brief review. First, more than one good player thinks this is the greatest chess book ever written.<br /> ... A student of mine in the local area has gone on a buying spree. He has purchased dozens of chess books in the last few months. (Against my advice, I might add.) One of the books he purchased was this one.<br />I have been to his home several times to give lessons. The last few times we have reviewed 2 or 3 games from Chernev's book. My student is convinced this book is the best chess book ever written. Almost no other author has bothered to place an explanation after every single move. One of the best games is game # 21, we see Chernev himself wipe out a strong player.<br />As I said before, every chess player (below 1800) who is really trying to learn the game - especially if he or she is struggling - should get this book.

Nice binding, sturdy and beautiful flex-cover, clear typesetting, white pages that are opaque and have almost no bleedthrough. (Hold one of the pages up to a strong light and you can barely see the print on the opposite side of the page!) I have spent many hours in this book preparing this review, (somewhere between 20-50); and the book shows almost no wear-and-tear at all! The publisher obviously went through great pains to produce a quality product. Begin to read inside and you see the author has produced an atypical opening book also. The first part of the book is an introduction where the author explains some of the basic ideas of the QGD in a very instructive question and answer format. The author even delves into things not usually covered by an opening book, such as various possible move orders and how they affect what you have to learn in the Opening as White and Black. I went through the book with a fine-toothed comb looking for errors of the type that chess books usually contain dozens, if not hundreds, of. I found no typo's, no diagrams with an incorrect position, no games with move pairs left out, no mistakes in analysis, etc. Obviously, the PC and chess programs are having a huge impact on the market of chess books. The publisher must also have a first-rate proofreader, someone who obviously must play chess!! (A plus over convention!)<br />The author covers virtually every line one could conceive of facing in the Queen's Gambit Declined, with one notable exception. (The Cambridge Spring's Defense for some reason is left out.) The author continues his highly instructive question and answer format. He often delves into questions of strategy and many other topics not usually covered by a chess opening's book. He uses complete games for a model, and the student always gets the entire game - from move one to the resignation! (An improvement over the norm for chess books.)<br />Chapter One covers the Lasker's variation, an early ...Ne4 in the QGD. Chap. Two covers the Orthodox variation with 6...Nbd7, (Old Main Line), and the various systems after 7. Rc1, c6. (He covers Capablanca's freeing maneuver, [early ...dxc4; and/or ...Nd5;]; without crediting the originator.) Chap. Three covers the Orthodox variation and even covers the ultra-modern 7. Rc1, a6!? Chap. Four covers White's 7th move alternatives in the Orthodox variation. Chapters Five and Six covers the Tartakower Variation in complete and up-to-date fashion. Part Two, [Chapters 7 & 8]; covers The Exchange Variation. (An early cxd5 by White.) The final section of the book [Part Three], deals with such lines as an early BxN/f6 by White, and 5. Bf4.<br />The coverage in this book is very modern; you will find very few \\"old/classic\\" games in here. (Necessary for a modern chess opening's book. The average game dates from 1985 to the present.) The coverage is fairly balanced, with both White and Black on the winning side. The author has obviously strived to make this a quality book and has even turned it into an outstanding teaching vehicle! I can find only a few minor faults with this book. I am puzzled how one could write a book on the \\"Classical\\" QGD and omit coverage of the Cambridge Spring's Defense. (A modern player can certainly count on seeing this line even today. It is certainly as likely a variation as any of the others in this book.) Some of the games that I thought were key to opening theory, (See any Informant, NCO, or MCO-14.); are not necessarily covered here. I am not sure what the criterion was for choosing the games, and the author does not explain that in this book. And the author often lets 25 moves of a game, (or more) transpire with virtually no comment. (BUT! ... the games are ALL complete; again, this is a plus over \\"the norm.\\") But again, for the most part, these concerns are trivial. I will conclude my critique by noting that the Table of Contents serves as an outstanding indexof the variations, and there is a first-rate index of complete games.<br />If I were grading this book as a teacher might, I would give an \\"A+.\\" On a scale of 1-10, I would give it an 8.5, which is as high a mark as I would be willing to give any opening book. (A pity. Had all of my concerns mentioned here [above] been addressed, I might have awarded it a perfect 10!!) This book sets a very high mark for a book on the openings, and all the others that come after this one will be judged by this new standard. The bottom line? If you currently play the White or Black side of the QGD in either postal or over-the-board chess, then you MUST buy this book! If you are below 1800 USCF and spend just a little time with this book, then you will probably learn as much as you have ever learned from any chess book, period. This is the highest praise you will ever see this reviewer giving an opening book.ex of the variations, and there is a first-rate index of complete games. <br />If I were grading this book as a teacher might, I would give an \\"A+.\\" On a scale of 1-10, I would give it an 8.5, which is as high a mark as I would be willing to give any opening book.

(Bad books do NOT become BCF's &quot;Book of the  Year.&quot;) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let's see. What do you get? A section on:  beginning chess, Openings, Middlegames, Endgames, Tactics, Attack and  Defence. You get a section on the chess clock, on-line chess (somewhat  dated), Correspondance chess, etc. Call it potpourri unlimited. (A little  of something for everybody!) In fact, there is a something of almost  everything about chess in here. (500+ pages!) [Maybe a little slanted  towards the British side of everything.]<br />Two minor criticisms:  Organization could have been a little bit better. And the paper is somewhat  yellowish and see-through. The book has NOT fallen apart, but the cover and  binding of my book is showing wear and tear. (But its been through a lot. I  used to take it to school EVERY DAY when I taught at a local school last  year!! The kids just loved thumbing through it.) Many pluses, one being  some of the most comphrehensive indexes I've ever seen in a chess book!<br />However, all this is nit-picking. Everyone I know who has bought this  book has LOVED it. And the bonus? It costs about 1/3 [or less], of what the  average chess book sells for!! Buy it. If you don't like it, a friend will  surely take it off your hands!!	2000-09-19

The book, \\"Winning Unorthodox Openings,\\" is a book by an English player,  IM A. Dunnington, who has a reputation as a trainer for English players who  participate in the Olympiad and also an excellent trainer of junior players  in the UK. He writes concisely in a no-nonsense style of which I approve.  I went through the first few chapters with a fine-tooth comb. I looked for  errors in analysis, and I found none. I looked for games that were quoted  in error, mis-spelled, etc., and I discovered no mistakes of this type  either. I went through the entire book, looking for errors in the diagrams,  (this used to be a plague to otherwise good chess books!), and I found none  of those type of errors either. The PC and programs like ChessBase are  having a huge impact on the field of chess books.  Having said that, I must  immediately point out a few things that grab my attention. The blurb on the  cover, and one in a press release promises, &lt;&lt; Complete and concise  coverage of all of White's alternatives to 1. e4, 1. d4, 1. c4, and 1. Nf3.  &gt;&gt;  This is not what you get when you plunk down your hard-earned  dinero.  First, he classifies the \\"Unorthodox\\" openings into two  categories, good and bad, (or playable and unplayable). This in itself is a  sticking point in my mind.  I can understand such openings as 1. h4, or a4,  or h3, being branded as bad. However, I find it odd he can label 1. g4,  (Grob's Opening) as bad, (beware Basmaniacs!);  but can throw  Solkosky's/Orangutan Opening, (1. b4,) in the \\"playable\\" pile. It seems to  me that they both do the same thing, just on opposite sides of the board. I  guess players of the Grob will have to get IM Basman's book on this  opening.  Several other VERY playable openings are dismissed with a wave of  the hand. One is Anderssen's opening, (1. a3, ); which is an opening I have  personally used in tournaments and never lost with. The author does not  seem to realize (or bother to take the time to point out); that this can be  one of the most complicated openings you can play. I also used to use it,  with tremendous effect on opponents' who are \\"booked out to the max,\\" but  have little or no understanding of the general principles of the game. I  also used to make this opening a very effective \\"Anti-computer\\" line, when  computers were still being allowed to play in tournaments with humans. It  can also be a highly transpositional opening and can result in a \\"reversed\\"  defense being played with an extra move in hand. That being said, there is  virtually no Indian game, (Or virtually any reversed defense for that  matter!); where the move a3/(a6) would not have come in handy. (Common  sense should tell you this.) Another point is that the author covers 1. b4,  and 1. b3. However, he does not bother to cover similar/related lines like  \\"The Improved Solkosky's,\\" with 1. Nf3 and then - and only then - 2. b4.  (Or 2. b3.) This is a shame because this method has been used by dozens of  strong GM's.  He also dismisses a reversed French Defense or a reversed  Pirc Defense in similar fashion. (I know a Master who liked his Pirc so  much, he began playing 1. d3, so he could play The Pirc as White!!) But by  now, the reader should get the general idea.  The author also seems to  confine himself to lines of  \\"independent value.\\"<br />So exactly what does  the author cover? There are five very good chapters of material. Chapter 1,  covers the Solkosky's/Orangutan Opening. (1. b4.) Chapter Two covers the  Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack. (1. b3.) Chapter Three covers \\"The Dunst  Opening,\\" or as the author calls it; \\"The Queen's Knight Opening.\\" (1.  Nc3.) Chapter Four  covers the \\"Bird's Opening.\\" (1. f4.)  (The From's  Gambit is covered in sufficient detail, but the line 1. f4, e5; 2. fxe5,  d6; 3. exd6, Bxd6; 4. Nf3, g5; 5. d4!?, g4; 6. Ng5!? [The author gives this  move a dubious appellation.] 6...f5!; is probably blown off a little too  lightly. [The position is very unclear and contains some of the most  complicated lines in chess.] Dunnington stops here giving the impression  that White is in trouble, but the fun is just beginning!)  The lines  recommended in the Bird's Opening are good and the theory is sound. Chapter  Five covers, \\"The King's Fianchetto Opening.\\" (1. g3.) This opening could  transpose to an almost endless variety of other openings, but the author  tries to concentrate on material that is unique and independent in nature.  Chapter Six is the Chapter where the author blows off the reversed French  or Pirc and perfectly reasonable openings like 1. c3. (As good or as bad as  anything else in the book.)  Instead, he gives minor coverage to the Grob's  Opening, (1. g4.); and then wastes a lot of time on a game beginning with  the move, 1. f3?<br />Now I think by now you may have gathered that these  openings are not exactly my cup of tea. The coverage is not in great depth  and could not be in a book of this size.  A plus is a very detailed Index  of variations. A slight minus is the absence of any Player Index  whatsoever.  So having said all of the above, could I recommend this book  to a potential buyer? The answer is : Absolutely! In other words, if you  are looking for something off the beaten trail or something unusual to  surprise your opponent, then this book is for you. If you have ever thought  about, or played the openings named above in a tournament, then you should  get this book. If you are under 1800, were going to buy only a few books  (say less than 10), and did not want to play \\"Main Lines;\\" then this would  be a good book to buy. The author gives many (21) complete and very well  annotated games. (I am a sucker for well-annotated games.) He also gives  numerous games and lines in the notes and the sub-variations. The material  is well thought out and organized very efficiently. If you like the unusual  openings or were just looking for an opening to surprise your \\"booked-out  nemesis,\\" then this could be the book for you!some of the most  complicated lines in chess.] Dunnington stops here giving the impression  that White is in trouble, but the fun is just beginning!)

You have read my review of &quot;Nunn's Chess Openings.&quot;  (IF not, you should probably go and read that first, because much of what I  said there --- especially in the &quot;warning&quot; part; applies here.)  Then why I am bothering to review or recommend this book?<br />The answer is  simple. I teach chess for a living. And my students give me a great deal of  very valuable feedback. For instance I recently attended the FL State Chess  Championships in Orlando. Many people came up to me and said stuff like,  &quot;I have read your reviews on Amazon and ...&quot;<br />The bottom line?  The average player is probably below a 1600 (rating) and has a very limited  knowledge of chess. Their libraries are often small, 5-10 books - if that  many. And they need as much help as possible.<br />If you are like me and  want &quot;Just the Facts,&quot; (&amp; like Sgt. Friday!); then you will  probably prefer Nunn's book. But do you have my background in chess theory?  Do you bring a USCF Life-Master's understanding of the game with you? Do  you have over 20 years of tournament experience? Have you played 50,000  games of chess on the Internet? No? Then you may want to get GM DeFirmian's  book.  (Please understand ... this is NOT a put-down or an ego trip!! I am  just trying to communicate - in the strongest possible terms - what the  majority of the players I have spoken to and what my students' have  communicated to me.)<br /> And if you like an occaisional explanation, and  would like the lines summarized, (and even a recommendation once in a  while); then MCO is the book for you. (If you live near a good size  bookstore, check them both out and decide for yourself!)<br />My friend GM  DeFirmian (and an excellent team of writers), has probably spent more time  on this book than 10 or 20 authors have spent on their works. Walter Korn  has always done a competent job of assisting in the editing. The nice thing  about MCO-14, as compared to the last edition of MCO; is that 75-90% of the  games quoted are now of the latest vintage. (The last two editions of MCO  are also sitting on my bookshelf.)<br />I have spent many, many hours in this  book.

My students and contacts in  chess prefer it over NCO like 3 to 1.<br />I still like NCO better!! But this  is also a good book. (If not for just a few typo's and some other minor  ticks, I would have given it 5 stars. But good or bad - I am a  perfectionist. And bear in mind, I have found a couple of errors [but a lot  fewer!] in NCO too!) If you are around 1800, you would probably be happier  - in the long run - with &quot;Nunn's Chess Opening's.&quot; But if you are  relatively inexperienced and fall into the category of 1650 or less; then  honestly you might do better with MCO. Or buy both and compare!!<br />Also,  one more piece of advice. If you are going to use this book a lot, do what  I did and order the Hard-Back version!!

This is an exception.<br />Here is what I say about this book on my web site:<br />&lt;&lt; The next book is by Irving Chernev. I met this man several times, and he had a real love for the game that few players today demonstrate. He would look at games by the hour with anyone. I personally believe Chernev was at least IM strength. (I believe he played in several U.S. Championships.) The book is:<br />&quot;The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played.&quot;<br />[62 Masterpieces of Chess Strategy.]<br />It contains 62 true masterpieces of chess by various different players. (Masters such as Fischer, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tal, etc. Plus many more of the all-time greats!!) Each game is carefully and lovingly annotated. This book had a tremendous impact on me and the way that I viewed and looked at chess.<br />{I studied it many, many,  many  times.}<br />Chernev provides games with an almost blow-by-blow commentary. His ideas are simple, fresh, insightful, and expressed with great clarity. He explains all the basic ideas of the game in a manner that ANY chess-player can follow. The variations are perfect. Not too much to overload the senses. I have had players who were almost beginners to players who were accomplished tournament players ... tell me that they profited from a careful study of this book. I think one should study this book, as I did. Every  time your rating goes up 100 points, you should work your way through this book from cover to cover!

Before you read my review, I ask that you read the majority of the other reviews. This may give you a better feel for what I'm about to say.<br />This is a FANTASTIC book. It is destined to become a classic. But, after reading  all the reviews, I have to make the following comment. This book may be  written for a really strong player. (or players.)<br />I think you should be  at least 1600-1800 to grasp much of what goes on in this book. There are  certainly many valuable insights which will make you a better thinker and  &quot;Calculator.&quot; But in the long run, your calculating powers will  already have to be fairly well developed to really benefit from this book.  I was already a Master when this book came out. I spent close to 6 weeks  with this book, and it made me a better thinker. But two of my students who  have bought and read this book felt it did NOT make them better at  calculating. Sadly, it may be true. The average GM may not remember what it  was like to struggle to see one move ahead. Because they do not understand  [or remember] the problems, it is difficult for them to address them.<br />If  you think you are ready for this book, buy it. But if you have any doubts,  get a couple of simple primers on tactics. Maybe &quot;Logical Chess, Move  by Move,&quot; by Chernev. Wait until your rating gets over 15-1600. Then  buy this book.<br />On the positive side, this book is beautifully written.  The examples are mostly very carefully chosen. And the book is wonderfully  and beautifully annotated. This was truly a work of love by the author. If  you are just looking for many, many hours of enjoyment, then you want this  book.	1999-12-15

If you are just starting out and just learned the moves a few days ago ... or you have been playing tournament chess for a couple of years and you still are not where you want to be; THIS IS THE BOOK YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING  FOR!<br />I am a Life-Master. I bought this book to teach out of. I was not  supposed to enjoy it. God forbid, a beginner's book should teach me  anything! But this is exactly what happenned.<br />Not since Capablanca's  Primer and Chess Fundamentals has there been such a book. A book like this  comes along once every 20 years. Believe me, I have sufferred through  enough of the bad ones, I appreciate the good ones.<br />If you are trying to  improve in chess and you can read, this book will help you. Hint: Set up a  board and study every position in this book. You will get the maximum  benefit from it.<br />GM and U.S. Champ Pat Wolff will make you a better  player.  Get it. Buy two.

Many years ago, I was at a tournament in Alabama. I was espousing several of my ideas. They all said, &quot;Hey - that sounds great, why don't you write a book?&quot; Then Silman came out with his book. All my best ideas  were in there. How did he do it?<br />Seriously, this is a GREAT book. I have  used the material in this book to teach many of my students. I can use what  is in this book to puzzle Masters. Do you know how many high-rated players  I have asked to name the various &quot;Anti-Knight&quot; techniques, and  all they have given me is a blank look? If you had a thorough knowledge of  everything in this book, you'd be at least an EXPERT. (USCF =&gt; 2000) I  think many Masters could learn something from this book. I know, I am a  Life-Master. <br />In my own not-so-humble opinion, this is simply, &quot;THE  BEST INSTRUCTIONAL BOOK EVER WRITTEN! &quot;  If you even think you want  to be better, this book had better be in your library! <br />[Note to J.S.

I currently teach chess full-time to make my living. All the endings you need to know are in here, maybe a few you don't.  Most players do not want to take the time and trouble to study endings, its just  too much work. But if you really want to get better, there is no way around  it.  I could offer many criticisms of this book, but I won't. They are  mostly VERY minor. Bottom line? If you are under 2100, or if you have ever  blown an ending, this book belongs on your chess bookshelf.  Or better yet,  don't buy it. Don't study it. Then put a sign on your back. I'll bribe  someone to play you at the next tournament. Thanks.	1999-12-14

Or would you just like to beat that loud-mouthed, bragging neighbor?  What you want out of the game should largely determine what you  buy. If you really want to get better, then buy a specific book on the the  phase of the game that you want to improve on.  The material in this book  is fair to good. A rank beginner could learn something from this book, but  that person would probably have to work hard to do so. I have a slight  problem with the way this book is laid out. For instance, the Chapter on  the openings entitled, &quot;The Opening: First Things First,&quot; is  chapter 10 and starts on page 155! Some positive things about this book is  it has lots of explanations and pictures. (Diagrams.)If you are familiar  with IDG books, and like their work, (XXXX for Dummies)you will probably be  satisfied with this book. If not, then don't pin all your hopes on this  book.	1999-12-14

I am a Master and I teach chess for a living. When my students want to learn an opening, or need a one volume reference for learning new openings, this is the book I  recommend to them. A &quot;MUST&quot; for the Postal player!  There is more  information and fewer mistakes in this book, than any opening compendium I  have ever seen! WARNING: If you are a casual chess player, or looking for  for a book to help you improve and learn something, this is not the book  you seek. This is a book for very serious chess players. If you have never  used an opening book before, you will find this book a very difficult  &quot;read.&quot; Its just lines and recommendations for what is best in  the openings. There are a great deal of symbols and lines that end with an  evaluation like &quot;White is slightly better.&quot; There is nothing that  explains why White is better. Unless this type of dialogue would be useful  to you, you are better off not buying this book.	1999-12-14

I have won more than 100 rated tournaments. My personal chess library is over 1,200 books.<br />When I was studying to become a Master, it was a tremendous eye-opener to me to  discover that there are not more than around 15 basic pawn structures.<br />GrandMaster Andy Soltis (who has played me and beaten me twice in  over-the-board encounters) lays out logically, all the basic different pawn  structures. He shows that there might be dozens of different move orders to  reach a certain structure, but once you get there-- there are only a  limited number of plans that work within the given pawn structure.<br />He  logically and sensibly lays out these different plans. He shows many  practical examples of how each plan may have worked in real, OTB play;  usually in the games of a well-known GM. The examples are very poignant.  His advice is easy, sensible, logical, and readily assimilated. It does not  matter if you are a Master, or just a Novice who wishes to improve ... this  is a book for you.<br />Credit this one book for turning a humble expert into  a Master who has tied for first in four different State Championships.  Easily belongs in my list of, &quot;The Ten Best Instructional Books Ever  Written! &quot;	1999-11-28

I, at one time, had memorized every single one of the illustrative games in the back of the book.<br />I had already been through this book several times. I was  stuck in a rut, so I decided to go through this book again.(My library was  very small at that time.) This process took about 4 months. Every time  there was diagram, I set up the position on the chess board. (I often used  3 chess sets and one pocket set.) I did not move on from one section until  I felt I understood EVERYTHING the Author had to say about that subject in  that particular section. The result? I went 4-1 in the Open Section of a  tournament and went from 1400 to 1700 in ONE TOURNAMENT!  (In the 70's.)<br />I have taught chess in several Public Schools and also in private  schools here in Pensacola. I have always used this book as my textbook, and  have designed an entire curriculum around this one book.<br />I also like  Reinfeld's approach to writing. Some Master's seem to write to impress  other chess authors and other Chess Masters. Reinfeld is writing for the  average Joe. You will readily understand and absorb what he writes.<br />Is  your rating below 2000? Do you want to improve?

He does note your opponent must be terrible and fall into your traps in order to for you to pull these traps on your unsuspecting opponents.<br />The average player does not understand  the correct ways to improve, and perhaps this is why he may remain an  average player all his life.<br />My first two books were trap books. All the  best chess teachers (GM Evans, Alburt; SM Smith, etc.) agree that tactics  are the first thing you should master, if you really want to improve. You  can only learn to play Positional Chess after you have mastered, The  Language of chess ... and that is TACTICS!<br />I'll tell a story. A player,  who had been playing tournament chess for at least 5 years and held a 1600+  USCF-rating; came to me and asked me to teach him an opening. He said he  was willing to pay. I told him the first step was to learn all the traps in  his opening. MEMORIZE them. Then learn the basic moves and some of the  ideas behind them. Etc.<br />We sat down at chess club. I did not have any  books with me, so I began showing him 20-30 traps that I knew of that  opening from memory. At first my prospective student was writing everything  down. Then later, I noticed he had stopped writing. He finally gave up and  despair, paid me and went home.<br />The point of this story? Mastering the  tactics are a fundamental step, one of the very first and most basic steps,  on the road to improvement. Most players are not willing to do this! Joe  Blow isn't looking to improve. Don't look at this book by Pandolfini as  &quot;Easy Ways To Win.&quot; Look at this book as the first step on the  road to improvement. You had better learn ALL the traps in the Opening you  play. I can guarantee your opponent knows them. Especially if you are  playing in tournaments or rated play!<br />I have both of these books (Traps  and Zaps) in my personal library. Don't you think they belong in yours?	1999-11-28
