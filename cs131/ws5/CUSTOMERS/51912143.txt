US	51912143	R18TM41FUBLA9Z	1412031826	464224851	Mallcity14	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A fascinating take on the future	This is the most refreshingly different dystopia to be released in a long time, and should be read by all interested in the genre.  Unlike other dystopias, this has not one distorted society, but two - an official opposition that is being used by the lords of society. <br /> <br />The story starts in hyper-consumerist hyper-mercantilist Mallcity 14 where everyone is required to purchase as much as possible and go as far into debt as possible, where the only value is newness and everyone is bombarded with commercials and computer surveilance.  The hero escapes during a computer glitch, and is brought to those who oppose Mallcity and the rampant consumerism. <br /> <br />Some will notice what may be an anti-capitalist theme to the book, never noticing that this really isn't capitalism but a distorted type of monetarism.  The alternative society is communal. <br /> <br />As this dystopia was recently written you will notice many parallels to our current society, which is the way a dystopia is supposed to operate: extrapolation from current trends.  That will be quite a refreshing change from 1984 or Brave New World.	2005-05-05

William Tell is largely unremembered except as an excellent archer.  Batman and The Green Hornet are in many ways servants to the state, only going after the private criminals.  The only hero one can compare The Black Arrow to is Zorro. <br /> <br />The first thing an observant reader will notice is that all examples of government abuse in this book are taken from real life, such as the case of Don Scott of Malibu.  They are only slightly enlarged, to make things bad enough to inspire resistance and revolt. <br /> <br />Fast paced and easy to read, it seems shorter than it's 700 pages, but it is not light or lacking in detail for the enjoyment of the reader. <br /> <br />The hero is a paragon, more than human.  He is a young, handsome, wealthy, ex-Rock star at the peak of physical fitness. <br /> <br />There is a fault with this book, but it is a fault common to most libertarian literature, in that the common criminal is missing.  Some might object that the government is too strict to enable them to operate, but that is not an objection a libertarian can sustain.  Others might object that they are all in government employ where it is safer for them to violate the rights of others.  As sustainable as that argument is, there are always independent operators for the Zorros of the world to fight as there is never a shortage of people who want to violate the rights of others. <br /> <br />Be that as it may, this is a great read.	2005-05-04

Liberals are calling this right-wing, while conservatives are jumping up to say \\"not me.\\"  That's  because of the basic confusion about what \\"libertarian\\" is, and neither understand the subject matter of this book.  He reserves equal condemnation for Lincoln and FDR, for Republicans and Democrats, so one cannot say it is biased for or against either major party.<br /><br />This book is not a complete history, it is a book that contains bits that are often left out of traditional history.  It never pretended to be more than that, and it does a very good job at delivering what it promises in an entertaining and straight-forward manner.  It flows well, contains much support, and has entertaining and informative sidebars sprinkled throughout the book.<br /><br />This book is called \\"politically incorrect\\" not because it attempts to be offensive or derogatory, but because the bits of history it includes, the bits often left out, are the same bits that the government doesn't want widely advertised.  These bits are incorrect according to the politicians.  This includes how the signators of the constitution recognized the right of secession, how President Johnson's impachment was politically motiviated because he didn't punish the South enough, the real source of anti-trust, and the great many things done by \\"do nothing\\" President Hoover.<br /><br />While a knowledge of history is required to understand this book, that same knowledge of history is not complete without this book.<br /><br />For the record, nowhere does he advocate any form of racism, sexism, fascism, etc., the charges commonly hurled at him by those who have not read this book.	2005-03-29

This book is on my listmainia list of dystopias, because it does show a society gone in a different, and unpleasant, direction.  It stands out on that list because, unlike other dystopias, this one requires a few elements borrowed from fantasy literature to make possible the relationship between the Giver and the Receiver. <br /> <br />Perhaps if that had been worked differently, this would have gone from four to five stars. <br /> <br />As a dystopia, this is one of the rare \\"female\\" dystopias.  A male dystopia shows how each person plugs into the society and how it impacts the family.  A female dystopia concentrates more on the family relationships and how they support society.  The two are similar but not the same.  This makes a good read for the reason of a refreshing perspective. <br /> <br />Even though this is considered \\"adolescent literature\\", it was well written enough for an adult to enjoy.  That's also quite a good thing, so parents can share this with their children.	2004-11-03

The problems with the Bible as noted by the Skeptic's Annotated Bible have been worked over by theologans for centuries.  Apparently all of the work done by Bible apologetics was ignored, and instead we have some rather interesting and amusing rationales for why the Bible really is infallable. This is done with little to no knowledge of Judaism, Hebrew, Greek, or Latin. The rationales are whimsical at best, and in direct contradiction to hundreds of years of religious thought.	2004-10-05

In this case, it is the mythic entities of many cultures all imported to America by those who believed in them.  Gods, faeries, leprechauns, djinn, and demons all inhabit America, living off scraps of faith and scams against regular people.  Couple that with more modern Gods, such as Almighty Dollar, Media, Internet, and the rest as those who are currently believed in.  There are also folk heroes and discarded modern Gods such as Johnny Appleseed and The Iron Horse.<br /><br />This isn't evident at first, though.  The main character, Shadow, believes at first that he is working for a crooked eccentric.  It is only through experience that he realizes he's in this \\"underground\\" culture and that his employer is a God, and is introducing him to other Gods.<br /><br />There are several excellent plot twists near the end that I won't give away, but they prevent the book from being predictable.  As I too often see how a story will turn out by one third of the way through, this was a particular delight.	2004-09-24

It has the standard introductory to casting a chart, but it has two particular things in it that I have not found in any other book I have ever read.<br />First, it describes each house cusp in each sign.  Normally books just describe Ascendant and Midhaven, but this includes the other 10 houses.<br />Second, when describing the aspects, it doesn't do the standard Good Aspect - Bad Aspect - Conjunction.  It does all five major aspects: Conjunction, Sextile, Square, Trine, and Opposed.  Separate interpreations for each aspect for each planetary combination.<br />Those are two excellent things that no other book I've ever ran across has.<br />The only down side is that the interpretations are a bit new-agey, so you have to sort the wheat from the chaff while using it.	2004-05-22

Then there is the political message that accompanies the book as part of the plot itself, as this book is almost a dystopian version of the future.<br />The only problem is with some of the evolutionary science.  Rapid mutation as a result of climate variation is quite an acceptable theory, along with punctuated equilibrium, but simultaneous identical mutation and goal directed evolution are not science.  Fortunately Sci-Fi requires plausability instead of strict accuracy.	2004-04-29

When describing the aspects, it describes Postivie Aspects and Negative Aspects.  There are five major aspects: Conjunction (neutral), Trine and Sextile (positive), and Square and Opposed (negative).  I do like having Conjunction listed separately at least.  Most astrology texts lump the positives and lump the negatives, but leave the conjunction as a separate category.<br />Beyond that, this book does have all the formulae you need to assemble a chart.  You will need an ephemeris for planetary positions, and a house table (...) for the house cusps, but those are just the input numbers.  This book tells you how to crunch the numbers.<br />More importantly, this book tells you a lot about interpretation, even with what it leaves out.  Dividing the chart up into roughly 20 categories, it helps the astrologer determine which parts of the chart are relevant to which topic.  That is a very central point, very necessary, very useful, and has become the foundation of my astrology.	2004-04-01

This book alone should describe what that means, but only if one is willing to read more that what was written by $ilver. If you need an introductory book, read Bucklands Big Blue Book. Those ready for more advanced work should read Gerald Gardner, and those ready for history and theology should read Raven Grimassi.<br />Wicca is a religion that embraces the cycle of nature. Life is part of that cycle, and so is death. The Goal of the Witch is to achieve balance with nature. It is no mystery to a Witch that when we are born we are covered with blood, a vital fluid of life. Wicca is also a religion that is trying to gain genuine recognition as a valid religion, practiced by a variety of people of all ages and walks of life, not just teenagers who think that magick is making a wish on your lucky quartz crystal.<br />On the other hand, you can sanitize and sugar coat the religion, take out anything that could possibly offend anyone, pretend that we are all sweetness and light instead of people with good and bad combined, and you would have $ilver Broomstick. That is why anyone who is initiated in a coven and has done actual work on their faith finds $ilver Ravenwolf both insulting and an impediment.<br />Traditionalists may criticize Z Budapest and Starhawk for their views, but not for their knowledge or teaching skills. Many debate whether the Farrars broke oaths when they wrote their books, but none dispute the genuine value of their books. $ilver, alas, has none of those redeeming qualities that even the pariahs of wicca posess. Her version of Wicca is to pretend that there is nothing bad in the world and that all witches are sweet and nice people who never do anything wrong because it is a sweet and nice religion with nothing even remotely resembling anything that might be considered dark. That leaves nothing but cuteness without substance, much like a Fluffy Bunny.	2003-05-09

As I wrote in my review of Silver Broomstick, she writes not to entertain or inform, but for the $ilver she is named after.<br />She already sanitizes Wicca to remove anything that might offend anybody with the slightest sentisitivities.  That leaves fluff and light without substance, sugary, and much cuteness without anything beyond it, like a Fluffy Bunny.<br />Then she abandons even the ethics her \\"blockbuster\\" trilogy managed to keep, when she wrote Teen Witch, which is nothing more than a spell book.  No theology or ethics, even the sugary and watered down version she gave before.  There really is nothing in the book.<br />Now, get it while it's hot, get it here, an actual kit that will make you a witch.  Extra Extra, you want fries with that witch kit?  We got your pentagrams right here!  No work, you're an instant Witch just because you bought this box.<br />No, it doesn't work that way.	2003-05-09

Demons, those who defied God, are portrayed in an anti-heroic light, a task not done well since Milton.<br />Regular fans of White Wolf games will note, Demons are not overly powerful in this book.  They are less powerful than Vampires or Garou, more on par with Mages or Changelings.  However, they are weakened due to their not belonging in reality at all.  They need to consume faith to power their magics, and that is really a scarce commodity in the World of Darkness.<br />I compared them to Vampires, Garou, Mages, and Changelings.  There lies the real problem.  While White Wolf games are designed to be playable independently, and the various races know little about each other save their existance, all the other games do note how each perceives the others in the event of an odd crossover.  This book leaves this out.  After &quot;Hunter, the Reckoning&quot; there were some guessing that White Wolf was tiring of cross-overs.  This book would confirm that suspicion.  There are little tidbits, such as why all this is happening now, that can only be answered by the other games, and it is indeed the same system, but can it really be the World of Darkness without the rest of the World of Darkness?<br />That is another thing missing. The Cosmology of the World of Darkness, central to Werewolf and Mage, and touching the other games, is completely absent.  There is no Weaver, Wyld, or Wyrm at all.  I hope a companion volume is written soon to reunite Demon with the rest of the World of Darkness.  What would a Demon-serving Nephandi destroyer do when faced with a Demon trying to set things right?	2003-04-30

Well, even though it is somewhat dated, you can still see a similar world as a possible future.  It is less likely than it once was, with Bradbury and Orwell seeming more likely.<br />In this future world, we have all of mankind addicted to pleasure.  We have genetic engineering so that people have their roles assigned to them long before they are born.  We have sleep teaching of children.  We have a world of slaves who do not know they are slaves and without any masters.<br />That is the most eerie part of this book - the slaves without the masters, the government that exists and doesn't exist at the same time.  In order to keep the people complacent and happy, there are regular orgies and easily provided drugs.<br />Many people will be turned off by that last bit, the sex and drugs culture, and that will become the focus of their concentration.  Such is a symptom of the society, but they would miss the cause.<br />This book is enjoyable on it's own, but it works even better as part of a study of dystopian futures.	2003-01-09

A technical translation is &quot;very very good&quot; and &quot;very very bad&quot;, but that is inexact.<br />It is difficult to review this book without making comparisons to current events or using the word &quot;prophetic&quot;.  It is a world where all freedoms have been eliminated in favor of the bureaucratic order.  It is totalitarian, as occasionally one or two people wake up to this fact.  There is only one crime, to think bad thoughts, and the main character is guilty, because he remembers the unofficial (and therefore non-existant) version of the past.<br />What is most interesting about the book is how, in the end, they completely warped the thoughts of the protaganist so that he goes from wanting to rebel against the government to the last line of the book &quot;Winston loved Big Brother.&quot;<br />That a government could progress to the point where it could twist a person's thoughts is frightening.  That people can read this book and compare it to any modern government is revealing.<br />Yes, this book is all the things people say it is, which is why it should be read.	2003-01-09

The second examined the conflict between the types of government, with Republics fighting Empires.  Third in the series, this book does drag a little at times, but details how and why future empires are likely to fall.<br />No, they do not fall lightly or easily, with the sole exception of the graceful fall of the British Empire, and when they do fall, civilization tends to revert to barbarism.<br />What would make an empire fall?  Many factors, each self correctable to the unbaised observer, but with those in power never being or listening to said observer.<br />One of the essays, on the Vietnam War, does drag a little, and that is the only thing that slows down what is otherwise an excellent read.	2001-09-10

In this volume, which is also a collection of short Sci-Fi stories and essays, he not only continues his attack on the Social Sciences, he attempts to reason which would be the government, one of freedom or one of tyrrany.<br />So which will it be?  He highlights the strengths and weaknesses of both, and his conclusion is that initially it will be empire, and eventually it will be republic.<br />I regret to say that there are no startling new breakthroughs in this book like the Pournelle Chart in the first volume, but the difference in perspective is worth it.  The highlight of this one is the discussion of Tribesman, Barbarian, and Civilization as three evolved stages of government.  To understand it, you must read it.<br />I thank Jerry Pournelle for this wonderful series.	2001-08-16

This book, while presented from the format of Science Fiction, is actually an analysis of what the government of the future would be like, because where Man goes, so goes Government.<br />In this first book, he spends most of his time trying to settle the question of war and empire, showing how he believes that each of these would be inevitable in the future.<br />Interspersed through the many science fiction short stories are essays and analyses.  One could call it basic Sociology or Political Science, except that he would consider it an insult to compare him to the Social Sciences, another topic he blasts in his book, coming from both an Engineering background and a Science Fiction background.<br />What makes this book most valuable is one short essay buried near the rear about the Pournelle Political Science Chart, in an essay about how the Social Sciences are not Scientific.  The analysis of government beliefs on a rather unique two dimensional matrix (and no, it is not the Nolan chart) is quite a startling and innovative new idea, worth the price of the book alone.<br />All this is in the first book alone.  There is now way I could rate this lower that 5 stars.	2001-08-13

His writings are intended for the serious student of the arts and beliefs of the Wicca.  There is no diluting of the craft with the brief overview of Cunningham or the sugar coating of Ravenwolf, nor is there the radical gender bias of Budapest.<br />He presents clear and well thought out intellectual arguments as to the origin and the practice of the original pagans of Europe.  I must criticize his attempt to tie everything back in to Rome, as his proofs are a little tenuous on these points, but unlike other authors, tenuous is not the same as absent.<br />On the other hand, since his book is not an introductory book, it will alienate many people unused to historical and theological views and readings on the wiccan faith.  He makes the point several times over that there are certain things that are Wicca, and without them, you do not have Wicca, all from the aforementioned historical and theological output.  He analyzes in greater depth than most authors the Wiccan Divinities of Goddess and God, and gives a more thorough analysis of old celtic belief systems than most of the pagan literature on the market, and I do highly recommend this book.	2001-05-25

That is the primpary purpose of this book, as she includes what she considers to be the best speeches from her four fictional writings, &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;We the Living&quot;, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;  To her credit, I agree with her selections, but that doesn't necessarily mean that these speeches are as good when taken out of context.<br />That is not to say that they are not good as they are, but they are more enjoyable in their proper context.<br />There is an original essay by Ayn Rand before she gives us a review of her other writings.  This essay is in many ways an Objectivist Manifesto, where she explains her view of most of history being dominated by the &quot;Mystics of Muscle&quot; and the &quot;Mystics of Spirit&quot;.  She call them &quot;Atilla&quot; and the &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; at the suggestion of Nathaniel Branden, but I would call them the Baron and the Bishop.  She does criticize other philosophers, especially Kant, for various reasons, including the much debated problem of Universals.  Those who say she did not solve it in &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot; show that they do not understand the solution, but that is not the subject of this book.<br />There is a lot of impassioned vitriolic rhetoric being used against Ayn Rand, from those who's philosophy is threatened by the existence for hers, but do not let that dissuade you from what amounts to an Objectivistic Sampler.	2001-05-02

His internal opponents are so blinded by their own dogmatic resistance to be able to comprehend that they are making their own situation worse by their opposition.  They are convinced of the evil of the Deryni, and will oppose a Deryni Duke, even if it means that an evil Deryni warlord will invade and conquer.<br />King Wencit of Torenth already has the upper hand by his trechary, having slaughtered the armies in the north, the Cassini and Kheldish armies and is ready for pitched battle against a divided Gwynned.  But even then, he has plans to skip the battle, a new plot and counterplot, a master schemer he is, pitting himself against both Gwynned and the Camberian Council.<br />There are a few interesting twists and a rather unsatisfying ending, but it does work out for the best, with no small amount of pain on the part of the victors.

There are many possible threads left over from the first book, and she picked them up adeptly.<br />Since there exists in Gwynned a race of Sorcerers known as the Deryni, there would exist people who hate and/or fear them.  In this world they are found largely in the church.  This sets up a conflict between the King and his Archbishop, the two single most powerful individuals in the kingdom.  That all of this happens on the eve of war makes it more stressful for King Kelson, and Archbishop Loris would rather go down in flames than compromise.<br />The allegories that can be made for racism are abundant and clear, as the status of Deryni is inherited, so can one be held responsible for an accident of birth?	2001-04-03

It can be read as stand alone, or as the introduction to the series, but should be read as the start of the series.  &quot;Camber of Culdi&quot; could also be read as the start of the series, but makes a slightly less effective start.<br />It is the familiarity of the setting that makes it comfortable.  Gwynned is clearly quite similar to the slightly more Celtic areas of medevial Britian, with it's borders of Keldor and Merea as Scotland and Wales.  The Deryni, a race of Wizards (it's inherited) add the edge of fantasy that makes the whole of the series facinating and unknown.<br />Clearly she also studied some parts of the Western Ceremonial traditions of Magick, for while she puts a new spin on them for the sake of fiction, she also makes them quite familiar to anyone who has studied them.<br />The characters, while three dimensional, aren't too complicated as of yet for this novel, as they are later developed more fully in later novels, but they are not characatures.  In all, it was an excellent work.	2001-04-03

Suppose five soldiers are standing around and a grenade lands between them. One of the soldiers dives on the grenade and, though instantly killed, saves the other four. According to the logic of Rand's philosophy, the soldier who dove on the grenade is evil and the other four are also evil for benefiting from the self-sacrifice of another. A perfectly consistent altruist, however, would say that only the sacrificial soldier is good and that the other four are evil: for the altruist would have all five pile on the grenade and get killed!&quot;<br />Such is an example of the Falsehoods taken up by those who disagree with Rand.  They fail, consistently, repeatedly, to understand what Enlightened Self Interest, or Virtuous Selfishness, consists of.<br />To follow through on the above example, if it is an all volunteer army (nobody is compelled to be there) then they knew the conditions of army life, and signed a contract agreeing to certain requirements in exchange for certain rewards.  They also know that the overall objective of the military is to win the war.  So, it logically follows, their objective is to win the war as well.<br />Thus, to follow through on their own selfish objective, the soldier throws himself on the grenade.  QED, and not even Greg Nyquist can disagree with that.<br />She does not advocate a survivalist mentality when she says that the object of our morality should be our own life.  There is more to life than survival, and that is why she advocates Rational Self Interest.  It is logically coherent to advocate such, as we are more than mere animals, we desire to live better.  I would rather have a house than a cave, and therefore would rather interact with my fellow man, for my own personal individual benefit.<br />People object, based on the fallacy perpetuated by Kant, that morality isn't rational, it's based on emotions, or gods, or society.  True, what most people thinkof as morality isn't based on reason, I have to give that much.  Then in return, I ask the objectors to note that their morality isn't the only morality in the world, and that other moralities exist.  Once that is accomplished, once you break the false connection between &quot;my morality&quot; and &quot;morality as a whole&quot; they can then see that it IS entirely possible to have a reason based morality.<br />The final objection comes from some people who then find it troubling that actions that are not approved in one morality and are approved in another, claim that the second is a false morality due to said actions.  That is a false judgement, saying, for example, that apples are bad on the citrus scale.	2001-02-23

They tend to lack the depth that the books of the series itself possess.  In this case, this book is an equal to the others in the series.<br />First of all, I would read the Foundation series first, before you read this.  I would also read the Robot series before you read this.  There are aspects of this book what would spoil the suprises in the other books if this was read first.<br />It gives you an in-depth look at the sheer diversity of mankind, all from the diversity he finds fleeing the government, a diversity that offsets the making of a mathematics that deals with our similitude.<br />The ending is also a suprise, even if you have read the other books, and for that, I must give Asimov credit.<br />Hari Seldon is given an impossible task, to find a way to quantify all of human activity, and he doesn't think he can do it.  Meanwhile, he is being hounded by agents of the government of Trantor, capitol of the Galaxy.  Yes, this book takes place when psychohistory is just an idea, before Hari became the all-knowing sage that he is pictured as in other books.	2001-02-23

Two people against the entire galaxy, balancing contending forces, being manipulated by three sides, all wanting to win on their own and being manipulated by each other, and the choice comes down to one man who was the focus of all their attention and they one they all tried to use, so that he alone, in defiance of all probability, decides the fate of the galaxy.<br />He is sent out to find the Second Foundation.  He searches for Earth instead.  He finds the Second Foundation, and an even more deeply buried secret, but not earth.  With this book, he first hears about Robots, and that begins the tie in.	2001-02-06

Or as close to that as a Deryni can get, actually.<br />This book has action, adventure, suspense, political intrigue, and sacrifice, the last often lacking in pulp fantasy.  The system of magic is based on the Ceremonial Magic of Europe, and should also be familiar to the reader.<br />Gwyned is clearly a anglo/celtic/welsh country, a setting close to home to almost anyone who speaks English, so you are able to step right into the mindset of the characters.

Will technology be enough to overcome the power of the mind?<br />Again, this is two stories, a pattern Asimov used in this series, but these are more closely tied together, being separated by a generation as both generations face the same foe in one way or another.<br />This novel is the inspiring finish, that completely fails to answer that, of the foundation series, a series that was started when a mathemetician started an effort to save the galaxy.  It is a struggle of an underdog, in this book as well, and the struggle of the mind to achieve.	2001-01-26

While I disagree with the unimportance of the individual (after all, wasn't Hari Seldon himself one person who changed history), it does show the travails as a small group of Foundationers try to stop the General, when he is stopped by the very corrupt bureaucracy he serves.<br />In the second, he brings in a new factor.  The Foundation, secure and dominant but not agressive, is threatened by the Mule, a person who can control the emotions of others, reshape them into whatever he wants.  Part of a slightly more fantastic area of Science Fiction, he still pulls it off well.  This time it does come down to individual effort again to stop the Mule, by opponents who could not defeat him one on one but do so by their determination and individual organization.<br />This time, he did not labor under the false assumption that he had to write a limited number of pages, so he was able to flesh out the characters more and make the plot twists more intricate, and did a truly excellent work.	2001-01-24

As a result of this, he has come to the conclusion that there are two types of knowledge, with no relation.  First there is knowledge of the world, which can not be validated rationally, then there is logical knowledge, which can not be validated by experience.<br />You can call that logic, but that would be a mistake.<br />Based on Kant's epistimological mistake, he then revives the doctrine of the mind/body dichotomy that had been dying since the rennaisance, and ventures into the field of ethics with, what is the logical conclusion of his earlier errors &quot;What you do for yourself is not moral, what you do for others is moral.&quot;<br />Having found that this does not work in practice, he then dismisses the ethical AND the logical as both incompatable with each other and incompatable with the world, and that is his critique of reason.<br />The quest of philosophy is not to raise questions, but to find answers.  Even if those answers are never found, and Kant would say that they could not be, we should ignore Kant's advice and continue to try.  Philosophy is not Analysis Alone, and Aristotle would be dismayed at the company in which he is put if compared to Kant on that point.<br />The logical conclusions of Kant's writings are evident in the various schools of philosophy, such as existentialism, surrealism, and linguistic analysis.  How do we know we exist?  What do we mean when we say that?  Don't bother to analyze, just deal what is in front of you.<br />A skilled Aristotelian is the best audience for this book, because then this book could get the savage review it deserves.	2001-01-17

In terms of beginners books, this is at the opposite end of the spectrum from $ilver Ravenwolf.  He doesn't offer the advanced secrets, but does show you what it is to be a Wiccan Witch.<br />He manages to artfully thread the line between revealing too much (oathbound) and revealing too little (Cunningham) and avoids making stuff up to fill pages ($ilver).

In my first literature class to look at literature from a historical perspective, I noticed that the styles did swing back and forth, occilating between two basic styles that she calls Naturalism and Romanticism.  Perhaps these aren't the best names for them, but they are not the worst.  That she then uses these names to cover other arts, such as music, painting, and sculpture feeds the critics, even though the basic ideas in each art are what enabled her to establish her groupings as she does.  As in all of her writings, she works off of the basic question of whether or not man is good, and sees all art through the lens of that question.  This makes for excellent politics and an enjoyable gallery of art, but does not necessarily make for a good review of art.  It is none the less a compelling collection of ideas, worth reading for anyone serious about art.	2001-01-16

This book stands as a refutation to Silver Ravenwolf by it's mere existance.  True, there is little information about Solitaries, but that is because a Witch isn't meant to be a solitary except by need, and Choice is a fallacy in that matter.    The information contained in this is first rate down to all the details that he revealed on the inner workings of a standard Garnerian Coven, and thus leaves a strong distaste in the mouth of all the fluffy neo-pagan new-agers who wrongly use the term \\"wiccan\\" just because they told their favorite pine tree that they are dedicating their lives to the goddess.    The only problem is the reason why this information is so good.  It is good because it is oathbound.  Janet and Stewart Farrar are oath breakers, warloks, because they printed this.  If you do not care about oaths sworn before the Gods of Wicca, if you do not care about honor or sacred trusts, go ahead and buy this.  It's contents are excellent.	2001-01-16

Mr. Asimov was working under the assumption that he had to keep it under a certain length, and so abbreviated it unfairly, cutting certain amounts of plot and character development.<br />That aside, this book is excellent, showing the struggle against adversity and brains versus brute force that is so lacking in most modern literature.  It is true that Science Fiction is the Modern version of Romantic (the time period) literature, and Asimov carried the beacon.	2001-01-16

They are wrong. If you are strictly a beginner, you might think &quot;wow, third in a series&quot; and consider this book to be an achievement. It is a rehash of the same Wicca 101 that was written in Broomstick and Cauldron (which at least was the best written of the three), but this time is just the few scraps she forgot to invent in the other two.<br />No, there are better authors out there. If you've already read one of her books, you don't need to read this. I recommend Buckland for just above beginner, and Gardner for the serious student of the Craft.<br />I wish she would stop insulting all true witches who have spent years learning and studying with her trite fluff. If she is a witch, what coven did she come from that tried to pass that off as real Witchcraft? Does she even bother to try to explain the difference between the two overlapping spheres of Wicca and Witchcraft? Does she care that some people want Wicca and Witchcraft to be taken seriously, and have to fight her every step of the way? No, she writes for her money, and doesn't care about how she hurts others in doing so.	2001-01-15
