Some voices leave us too soon. <br /> <br />Silverberg's \\"Born With the Dead\\" is a disturbing commentary and travelog.  If you've ever had to let go against your will, this will reach you. <br /> <br />LeGuin's \\"Day Before the Revolution\\" talks about waiting and wondering, as life passes one by. <br /> <br />Grant, Zelazny, Benford, even editor Gunn.  All these writers are now (and most of them even then) recognized for the brilliant evocations they can create.   <br /> <br />But besides that, these anthologies are a time capsule, a period piece of the art.  Reading these reveals the character of the year in question, as seen through the eyes of society's futurists.  Some predictions pan out, some fall flat, but through it all, you see the human condition set against the world.	2005-09-28

The British weren't unmitigatingly evil.  The war started largely from politics that continued into violence.  The officers in question on both sides are portrayed accurately, as cool, panicky, competent or foolish as they were, with documentation from named sources. <br /> <br />Despite that, it's written in a style beginning readers will find interesting without being too tough.	2005-09-28

Technobabble worse than Star Trek about FTL travel (\\"retrograde Earth time,\\" \\"reversing the spin of DNA,\\" \\"electromagnetic bioplasma,\\" \\"atomic nuclei counter-rotate (when traveling) at vast speeds,\\" the ability to conveniently discover O2 atmosphere planets around other stars with 1975 tech, causality violations and more.  Boyd isn't clear on the difference between pulsars and black holes, and his universe has a mechanism whereby gravity can slow tachyons to visible violet.  He doesn't explain how. <br /> <br />It turns out said pulsar is heading very rapidly toward Earth, past Barnard's Star.  So an exploration mission to Barnard's will divert past the pulsar for some kind of hyperspace slingshot effect.  Why and how this pulsar is traveling at a high percentage of luminal velocity isn't explained.  What anyone can do to stop it isn't explained. <br /> <br />The exploration mission has as its backup plan an attempt at a viable colony should Earth be damaged.  This colony will start with 5 men and 1 woman (given a 10% chance, we're told).  They think the human race may depend on it, but 10% is a good enough bet?  Good point.  They decide on TWO women. <br /> <br />Well, these professional military people and scientists infight, they make up, they stay on the planet around Barnard's (Also called Barnard's for some reason), and never get around to examining the pulsar or heading back to Earth. <br /> <br />In between the story is bad Aldiss, bad Niven and bad Rodenberry shaken and stirred, with screwy time travel, intelligent plants and love affairs in idyllic paradises of carnivorous trees. <br /> <br />Zero stars.

Ackerman has a PhD from Harvard, but certainly doesn't come across that way in this treatise.   <br /> <br />Full of such generalizations as \\"The Laffer curve, as seen by everyone else.\\"  Come on, no one else supported a basic concept the entire economy was based on?  Clearly, a lot of people did.  In this case, \\"Everyone\\" clearly means \\"Me and my disciples.\\"  As such, it's worthless commentary. <br /> <br />There are some valid comments on the progressive tax scale, but as a Socialist, his position is obviously that taxes should be raised more at the upper end.  He even complains, among other things, that under Reagan, interest payments on the national debt had \\"never been cut.\\"  Was he promoting spiralling debt?  If not, were those comments anything other than anti-Reagan slams? <br /> <br />Then there's the now popular claim that a tax cut \\"benefits the rich more\\" because they pay more tax to start with.  While I agree that cutting lower brackets more would be fair and useful, it's axiomatic that a person earning ten times as much will save more in an across the board tax cut, as their tax will exceed the INCOME of many in the lower brackets.  So what?  Is this a dog-in-the-manger approach that no personal benefit is better than someone else getting a better benefit?  Well, that's a classic socialist belief, and he does repeat it, so I'd say, \\"Yes.\\" <br /> <br />Many of the policies of the Reagan administration were simply continuations of Carter-era or Vietnam-era policies.  Ackerman makes note of this...and then blames Reagan. <br /> <br />There's the obligatory chapter on nuclear policy and budget, using such technical phrases as \\"bomb back to the Stone Age\\" (He's quoting someone else, but feels free to adopt a saying that is both meaningless without context and demonstrably inaccurate in any real context.  A strategist or nuclear scientist he is not.) <br /> <br />He attacks Friedman and others for suggesting that 20 years or more of policy change might be necessary for results to show, lambasting them about claims that a 3 year time span was inadequate, and extolls many of the virtues of Socialist systems the USSR tried for 75 years to make work and failed miserably to do.  Apparently, only socialists are allowed a long baseline for study.  Capitalists must make it work now with a few minor brushstrokes or shut up. <br /> <br />There is nothing wrong with criticism, examination and discourse, or with intelligently presented alternative scenarios.  But there is little of that here.  The valid points he did make are now understood in hindsight.  The rest is garbage. <br /> <br />I don't want this to sound too harsh.  Even a 10% success rate is respectable in the blurry field of economics, and I'd say he achieved that with his professional articles.  But this puff piece was written purely as propaganda in very simplistic terms, as most socialist and communist treatises are.  On the surface, they look encouraging.  As long as you don't think too hard.	2005-09-25

It was \\"Armageddon 2419 A.D.\\" and was written in 1919.  It _WAS_ a profoundly racist and anti-Asian book by modern standards.  With that in mind, Caidin's tale is actually rather well done.  He kept much of the flavor of a dated book, while bringing it closer to the present day reader.<br /><br />If there's any blame here, it's on the publisher for trying to drag what should remain a period piece in literature into the contemporary.  I assume, since TSR-now-WotC was the publisher, that it ties into a game somewhere.<br /><br />As a writer myself it always makes my teeth itch when reviewers, who should know better, attempt to drape the author in his characters.  A good writer's characters may resemble himself in any detail or none.  This is clearly the latter.	2005-07-05

Books	3	0	0	N	N	Police chase in the air	This is a combination spy thriller and police procedural, with the catch being that most of the chase and intrigue is in the cockpit.  Normally, apart from the technicalities of flying, an aircraft cabin is fairly boring.  But Caidin manages to keep the tension and interest up. <br /> <br />With shades of gray among both the good and the bad guys, Caidin manages to draw distinctions between addicts and recreational users, and the criminal rings pushing drugs.  The cops range from honest and competent to stupid to crooked to downright insane.  There's quite a bit of depth to the characterizations. <br /> <br />While gripping, there's still a relaxed pace to the story, no hurry to rip through it, and the prose is quite vivid.  I never visited Florida in the early 70s, but I can see it rather well as painted here. <br /> <br />The downsides are that there are a couple of spots that are too pat--people suddenly hit it off.  It's believable in context, but I'd have liked more background.  The meetings and barroom tips were just a bit too easy.  Then the ending, with all the loose ends being tied up was very typical of the crime drama genre.  It went quickly, and a couple of bits brought in came from left field.  Again, a bit more foreshadowing would have been good.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, it's highly entertaining, very readable and believable, technically complete without bogging down in babble.  Well worth rereading for the scenery.	2005-07-05

So as a reference for the era it's lacking.  This printing also does not place the original date. <br /> <br />As a reference for studying biblical stories, it's quite useful.  It shows the appropriate names and places as described in scripture. <br /> <br />As a modern historical reference it's outdated and laughable.  Despite the rants of literalists, no serious scientist, even those from major religious orders, really believes the universe was created in 4004 BC.  There is simply ZERO evidence to support this, and closing one's eyes doesn't make it go away, nor is it a particularly Christian thing to do.  Faith does not mean denying reality and observation.  Faith means continuing to believe regardless of changes in world view.   <br /> <br />I can only recommend it as a secondary source for 19th century theological study and for biblical geography.  As anything else, no matter how pretty the illustrations, it's a tertiary and badly outdated source at best.	2005-07-04

I'd only disagree with the previous reviewer on one point--Dr Pournelle has degrees in engineering, psychology AND political science.  He's served as a presidential space policy advisor, worked in the aerospace industry, for NASA, as deputy mayor of LA, as editor for BYTE Magazine and as an artillery officer.  Some of his treatises are required reading at the US military academies. <br /> <br />Yet in works like this, Dr Pournelle makes his points in an interesting and entertaining fashion.  His introductions, comments and essays are not dry, but very readable.  They're clear but in depth.  I've learned a great amount from Dr Pournelle, and continue to do so on his site, with its in depth analysis of environmental, space, energy and political issues.  What can you say about the man who invented blogging back before the net, when BBSes were the only computer medium? <br /> <br />The tone of this series is dark, but with an optimistic edge.  The tales can be cautionary, inspiring and just plain fun.  Most have a military flavor, with imagery sharp and bright.  Then there's the occasional Kipling thrown in, that shows how the same problems persist in each society, from frontier to republic to empire. <br /> <br />There are some forgotten gems and classic works in this anthology.  If you're serious about human development, the military or science fiction, you should have this and the others in the series on your bookshelf, and re-read them every few months.	2005-06-02

It expresses such important points as self doubt being a usurpation of God's judgment by the individual, and helps define the role of each in Christian theology.  It provides scriptural references as bullets at the end of each chapter, and is well-supported with other references. <br /> <br />Neither my wife nor I are Christian, but we found it morally and spiritually useful.  I think that's the best praise I can offer.  I'd give it five stars if it were longer.  This is the first theological text I've read where I wanted more.	2005-05-09

It ranks up with Heinlein's Starship Troopers (the novel, not the stupid movie with the same title) and Haldeman's The Forever War. <br /> <br />Drake always manages to impart wisdom under the horrific gore.  It's actually incredibly subtle in its own perverse way.  Drake loads on the blood as a cautionary tale.  He served with the 11th Armored Cavalry in Vietnam, and it still shows in his writing and occasionally in his talk.  This isn't gore to titillate, this is gore to revolt, just in case you start to develop the theory that violence is a neat thing.  It's harsh enough it will probably override years of stupid shootemup computer games in the current generation.  Yes, it's THAT grisly. <br /> <br />But the characters are where the story is.  Along with a decrepit, burned out, wrung out bunch of leftovers from previous engagements, a civilian reporter rides along.  His goal was to investigate the \\"Waste\\" of money on the mercenaries that could be spent on additional indigenous forces.  All he sees at the beginning is the rough, crude exterior of the unit. <br /> <br />On post during an attack, he winds up dragging along during a hell for leather chase across the continent, a desperate attempt to relieve the capital with the only troops available--the Slammers' sick list.  It's that or be left as fodder, and the enemy doesn't care that he's a \\"noncombatant.\\"  Violating the non-interference concept reporters try to embrace, he mans a gun and offers his best military skill--shooting a grenade launcher as he learned as a reservist years past.  \\"That's it, Turtle!  you flush 'em, we'll shoot 'em!\\" one of his squad mates advises through a burst of fire.  Even more than the Slammers, this is the last place he wants to be, and there's simply no choice. <br /> <br />At the end of a brutal, casualty-ridden drive across a hostile wasteland of enemy action, bad roads, \\"friendly\\" fire and inadequate supplies, he has the answer to his question.  Why spend money on professionals?  Because they're the only ones who can accomplish the impossible.  As Montesquieu said, \\"A rational army WOULD run away.\\" <br /> <br />That's when the story took a twist.  Upon relieving the town, the mercs are shunned and ridiculed for their \\"disgusting and unprofessional\\" appearance by the alleged professionals of the local army and government.  Our reporter reacts with righteous indignation and murderous rage that troops brave enough and dedicated enough to pull off the impossible are regarded as trash by pretty boys with no trigger time... <br /> <br />...and is stopped by one of the gunners, who tells him, \\"It don't mean nothin'.\\" <br /> <br />I was appalled by the ending. I was outraged.  It seemed to not be an ending in any fashion.  It was six months later, during a discussion where I was trying uselessly to explain the concept of military duty to a civilian who simply CANNOT understand what it means.  Some can, some can't.  Those who can't never will.  That's when I understood.  \\"It don't mean nothin'.\\" <br /> <br />Nineteen years of service.  A few hours to read.  Six months for it to make sense.  And a story I will never forget. <br /> <br />And sadly, most civilians will never get it.  That's not an insult, it's a cultural observation. <br /> <br />Bravo, Dave.	2004-10-20

John took it to new levels.<br />First, as an military engineer veteran, it was gratifying to see the Engineers given prominence.  Prominence?  Hell!  They taught the Posleen PAIN!  There's very few alien invasions that can't be resolved by the suitable application of a few million tons of claymores and C4.  <br />But there's more than that.  He managed, technically, to portray combined arms interestingly and accurately, explain the frustration of dealing with political sandbagging, while letting us see why the politicians feel equally hamstrung.  He let us feel the gut-wrenching fear of troops who know they're going to die, but get the job done anyway because sometimes there's no point in giving up.<br />The Posleen are an alien it's hard to feel empathy for.  Reptilian centauroids that are immune to most toxins, are hatched knowing how to shoot, and slice anything animal including slow-moving children into sushi as they run, they just beg to be killed.  And yet, they do have a culture and are grasping at an understanding of their first real enemy, the human race.  By their own standards they are moral, and they have individuality and quirks.<br />Add in some hysterically entertaining NSTIW stories that are axioms among vets (&quot;This is the USS Missouri, twenty miles offshore.  Glad to help, Army!&quot;) that fit into the story without being cliche while still causing one to want to pop a beer, and you have riotous entertainment, gripping action and an ancient plot that holds up amazingly well through his telling.<br />And the engineers get to blow up whole DIVISIONS of Posleen.<br />You might want to read A Hymn Before Battle first, because it's also good.

It is of much less use for acoustic steel string or electric players.<br />Nevertheless, one can't properly play any guitar without a basic study of the classical.  This book is complete--it covers construction styles to look for, proper woods and finishes for good tone, judging the condition of a used instrument, and basic hold and technique (that so many &quot;rock&quot; players abandon for the sake of slinging an axe low and looking cool, while damaging their wrists and hindering their playing).<br />I agree with other reviewers that it moves VERY fast--there are tricks such as tambor and percussives discussed in here, along with octave harmonics and complex chords that are beyond most beginners.  I'd recommend learning a few basics before picking up this book, and using it in concert with other texts to keep perspective.  Do bear in mind that Noad is biased toward the classical guitar--I don't agree, for example, that a radiused fingerboard makes no difference to playing and should be avoided.  This is traditional wisdom about a gut or nylon strung instrument, and absolutely false with regard to steel string or electric, the latter of which sometimes have compound radii and staggered frets to improve action and play.<br />A good book not despite but because of its focus on the classical.	2004-06-21

Good enough.<br />But then we get to origins and science, which is the heart of any system.  Here it's very contradictory.  The entire section on biology and origin first states that contemporary evolution is observable and real, then states that obviously evolution as origin is wrong as it contradicts the infallible Bible, then says that the Bible is theology, not science and doesn't give details so shouldn't be relied upon overly.  After that, it stereotypes all evolutionists as anti-Christian, moral relativistic types with no regard for ethics.  It attacks Christian evolutionists and old-Earth Creationists as deluded and not real Christians(tm).  But, everyone operates on faith and it's wrong to attack others faiths, we're told.<br />The bigotry and stereotypes simply don't hold up for anyone who's spent even a few minutes debating with people from various belief systems.  It's a desperate attempt to not think too hard in case one questions one's beliefs, which is the fundamental necessity of any good religion or science--only by questioning assumptions can one find truth and defend it with confidence and faith. <br />Not recommended.	2004-06-21

US	37545724	RCGYHANT9WN6M	0883270048	454945228	Walking Davis	Books	4	1	1	N	N	More than just a walkabout	So, this guy gets hired to walk around the world as a publicity stunt...<br />The cops tell him he can't walk on the road--&quot;but nobody walks! Roads aren't made for walking!&quot; A reverse racist Jamaican tells Davis he hasn't &quot;suffered&quot; enough to tackle the project. His family doesn't care much, and his sponsor pulls support.<br />And still Davis keeps walking...Des Moines, Peoria, Kankakee, Lafayette, Marion, Columbus and Newark, Pittsburgh, up into Vermont and then Canada, Scotland and England, France, Germany, Greece and Turkey...<br />The obsession shines through in the writing. It's wonderful to see something as mundane as walking made a gripping adventure and a metaphor. Davis' trials are with the system as a rebel, with nature as a man. Just as I'd think of one of his setbacks as excessive, I'd recall that things could be worse. Which may be the point here. If we stop walking, we surrender to the world. Davis won't be stopped. Lack of support, a conman agent, the spotlight swinging to an upstart competitor, police, psychiatrists, Greek nurses and their jealous brothers, all are just bumps on the road.<br />The characters are quirky and enjoyable, the narrative makes me smile and is compelling. I read it through in two hours, which is far too short a time to appreciate a work like this. It's inspiring but in a subtle way. A shame it's not in print at this time.  Read the story of the man who was buried by an earthquake, crucified as a false prophet, shot as a spy, sold as a slave, who climbed the Himalayas and learned the language of rocks, whose memorial was built on a parking ramp.	2004-06-17

It's a juvenile novel, yet it has many rather sophisticated themes.<br />Telepathic twins are used to keep exploration ships in contact with Earth.  The fact that telepathy (in this story) is faster than light affects the physics community.  Pat and his brother Tom are complex and have deep-seated emotional issues about being split up and going on a mission where the odds of the traveler returning are quite slim.<br />One ages, one doesn't, due to time dilation effects, and upon returning their meeting is far from simple.<br />In the meantime, habitable planets are discovered, Pat has to deal with teen and adult social issues aboard a crowded ship on a years long mission, most of the sister ships are lost in accidents, much of the crew of his ship die from disease or hostile aliens.  He's hardly a young man himself upon return, even if his years aren't great.<br />And how should he feel when the faster than light aspects of telepathy lead to faster than light spaceships, leaving him a relic of a forgotten past when he does return?<br />Time for the Stars is action packed and scientifically consistent, with realistic and deep characters.  The shipboard content is real in a way only a Naval officer like Heinlein could make it.  This book and the others in his juvenile bibliography are what sucked me into science fiction, and a major contribution to me being the writer I am today.  Take that as advice or as a cautionary tale, but this book is excellent even 50 years later, even after I've matured 25 years since first reading it.	2004-06-09

He protested at Che's execution.<br />With that insight, I eagerly read The Motorcycle Diaries.  They are very well written, amazingly entertaining, witty and occasionally insightful and the translation is not only excellent, but well-referenced where terms are transliterated.<br />Personally, I wound up detesting the little troll.  He and his friend masqueraded as experts on leprosy, which they milked for guest space and food.  They stole liquor, whined about hospitality until they got even better fare and generally were locusts on the local economy.  Che complains mightily about bureaucracy and control that keeps him from his wants (The lack of border stops some places, which made it harder to cadge rides from passing trucks), yet makes a point of mentioning his illegally carried revolver and knife that he smuggled through other border checkpoints (and heck, who wouldn't, when traveling like that?).  In other words, &quot;If I want it, it's good government.  If I don't, it's bad.&quot;  The true moral dishonesty of the Latin communist comes through.<br />And yet...he was honest enough to preface the book with a note that it represented only a momentary view of his life at that time and place.  He didn't edit out any of the bad.  The contrast and complexity is fascinating, and I'll have to find more to read about a no doubt highly intelligent man.<br />Love him or hate him, the book is honest in its documentation and pulls no punches.  It's a great period piece, a great low-budget travelog, and a journal of a young, brilliantly stupid college punk like lots of us were.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  If you want to understand the Latin communists or Che, you must read this.	2004-06-09

He's pro-Cuba.<br />The son of a well-to-do doctor who escaped to Miami, Felix has spent his entire life fighting against Castro and his communists.  One of the last men to see Che Guevara alive, he said he greatly regretted the man's execution and protested against it.  He even relays the ironic anecdote of how a physician (Che) wound up as economics minister for Castro, and their brief but informative discussion on why the Communist rebellions in Africa failed.<br />He also has no love for the CIA, detailing the number of times in the Americas and South East Asia that the Agency screwed up his missions from bureaucracy or sheer stupidity, and the pathetic budget they were allowed to use.  He considered them to be useful idiots in his own crusade.<br />Idealistic to a fault (Several faults) and yet quite shrewd, it was Rodriguez who warned LTC Oliver North that the arms coming in were being grossly overcharged for and that someone was pocketing the money.  That he was ignored by North and others shows again the frustrating universe he had to operate in.  And yet he persisted.<br />The writing drags a little here and there--this was one of Weisman's first projects, I believe.  But it's not bad overall and there's plenty of content.  A great counterview to the numerous bios of Che and others, and a rare examination of the very underplayed US response.  The CIA didn't smash the Communist Revolution.  The Revolution failed due to it's own (greater) incompetence and dishonesty.  A comparison of the players on each side makes that obvious, and Felix was one of those players.<br />A fine addition to my library.	2004-06-09

It is complex, and the political interactions of most of the nations of Europe make it a huge task to explain.<br />This book lacks.  I'm sure the facts are complete and accurate, but the writing is as dry as week old toast.  None of the personae came alive, and none of the facts were made memorable.  I would recommend it as a reference, perhaps, but not as an interesting read on the subject.  It sits on my shelf while I seek better written works to capture my interest.	2004-06-03

I found Michael Bellesiles' book &quot;Arming America&quot; to be most amusing.  I have to be amused, otherwise I would be outraged that such drivel could come from an alleged historian.  Let me start at the beginning:<BR> His survey of probate records covers only those who had wills and probate proceedings.  These people were typically rich urbanites who had no need to hunt and could rely on neighbors for help if attacked.  Since there was usually at least one person in the house at all times, the risk was slim.  This survey does NOT represent the typical American at the time, but the typical elite snob.  And most of them STILL had guns, based on the VERY PROBATE RECORDS HE CLAIMS TO HAVE USED.<BR> American settlers, as he notes and then contradicts, used rifles for hunting.  Muskets, which were military weapons, were inaccurate other than in volley fire, so were not desirable for frontier use, hence the lack of interest in buying surplus ones after the War of Independence.  It did not take &quot;two days&quot; to find game, &quot;luck&quot; was not needed, and the typical game would be rabbit or squirrel, which are far more plentiful than deer.  One would be unlikely to slaughter chickens regularly for meat, as he suggests, unless one had a sufficient breeding population to replace those slaughtered.  It would actually be far easier, despite his amusing theories on hunting, to bag a woodchuck, squirrel, or rabbit.  And they all taste like chicken.<BR> Gunpowder is merely charcoal, sulfur, and saltpetre.  Sulfur occurs naturally, charcoal is readily made, and saltpetre takes little effort to distill from cow manure.  As late as 1873, the Zulus were using stones as projectiles in their muskets.  This destroys his myth that owning a gun made one &quot;dependent&quot; on the government for lead and powder.<BR> Flintlocks are remarkably simple devices, with only two springs and three major moving parts.  Where he got the notion otherwise I have no idea.  They functionwell, are easy to clean (they do not take &quot;all day&quot;), and displaced the earlier bow because of ease of use, despite a slower rate of fire and greater expense.<BR> He makes an issue of gunsmiths not advertising in major newspapers of the day.  Only the wealthy could afford luxury guns, and newspaper ads were expensive.  Had he bothered to review old blacksmithing manuals, he would find that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM contained instructions for manufacturing, finishing, treating, and repairing non-luxury firearms, including building rifling cutters to rifle the barrels.  Hardly the thing to waste paper on if these items were as scarce as he claims.  There is a video available from Colonial Williamsburg in which their resident smith manufactures one from raw materials in one day.<BR> While it is true that the Continental Army (which numbered in the hundreds in 1795) sneered at the militia, ask any reservist today, and one will find the same attitude persists.  He clearly has forgotten that it was the militia that drove the British from Washington during the War of 1812, the Army not being within a hundred miles at the time.  So much for their relative effectiveness.<BR> Early weapons were rusty?  This much is true.  Petroleum lubricants not being available in that era, bear grease had to suffice.  As we all know, North America tends to have climate that encourages rust.  What else could they do?  How does surface rust affect the operation of a firearm?<BR> Finally, one must ask, &quot;So what?&quot;  So few Americans owned arms (if we concede for sake of argument that he is correct, which he is not).  Few people, even with the modern advantage of email, actually write to their local newspapers or elected officials.  Should we assume by this that there is no right to free speech?<BR> He makes excellent use of the negative proof method--that lack of mention equals lack of presence.  By that logic, outhouses were also scarce.  I have found very few historical references to them.  One tends to report only the unusual as news, and firearms were not unusual in Colonial America.<BR> Bellisiles is all too typical of the true gun nuts in society--those who use their position to destroy civil rights from some misguided father-knows-best philosophy.  He should evaluate his goals.  If he wishes to be an historian, he should stick to history and do better research--like not referring to probate records from San Francisco in the 1850s, which no one on the planet (besides himself, apparently) has seen, since they were destroyed in a fire in 1906.  If not, then he should be honest and declare himself a politician.  And I don't need 600 pages to make that point.	2004-04-01

In that light, his statements in this book are baffling.    Hussein used mustard agent and others against Kurds and Iranians in the 1980s.  As of 1998, Hussein did have WMDs, and everyone, including Ritter, says so.  Since then, there are two possibilities--either Hussein destroyed them or he did not.  Proving a negative is always tough, which is why governments keep track of research and documents--to \\"prove\\" they were destroyed.  Ritter and Pitt, however, take the approach of \\"Who cares?  After 5 years his chemicals would be decayed and worthless.\\"    An interesting theory.  Yet the US still has undecayed stockpiles of VX at Newport Chemical Depot, Indiana, manufactured before 1968.  It has stockpiles of mustard gas from WWI at Fort Rucker, still surrounded by a safe zone after 80 years.  No one knows how to dispose of them safely.    Quoting from a recent article:  12/9/04     Subject: EOD Guys at Dover    DOVER, Del. A suspected blister agent in a World War I-era shell found near Bridgeville injured three members of a military explosives disposal team at Dover Air Force Base this week, prompting an investigation by the Army's chemical weapon center in Maryland.    (snip)    In light of that, the statement that, \\"Chemical weapons would decay within five years,\\" is hard to grasp.  Ritter allegedly is an expert in this field, so he certainly should know this. When queried about this, Pitt declined comment.    With the current discoveries of large numbers of aircraft and tanks being dug up in the Iraqi desert, buried against Saddam's imagined future return to glory, the case for the existence of WMDs is still very much open.    I do hope Pitt and Ritter are correct.  WMDs not in Hussein's hands are even worse than ones under his control, and Bush has taken a big bite of something that might bite back.  In that light, \\"War On Iraq\\" helps neither side of the debate, by Pollyanna-izing a serious issue.    Does Hussein still have WMDs?  No, he's in custody.  Does Iraq still have WMDs unaccounted for?  Yes.  Do they actually exist?  No one knows.      Further investigation is called for, by all parties.    The book isn't well written, is clearly unfactual in the above and other areas, and, as has been noted by others, lacks a reference or bibliography.  It might have been more honest to market it as fiction.  It's merely a crass attempt to cash in on fear and make a few bucks, only aimed at the left instead of the right.  There's certainly no answers here, and Ritter is either incompetent or a liar.  That makes me wonder about the entire inspection program.	2003-12-20

Stress destroys relationships, and there's enough stress in this job for a dozen ordinary people.<BR>Some of the more gut-wrenching moments include descriptions of rescues where the weather won't allow an air pickup, so a PJ jumps into the sea with the hope of being able to keep himself and the victims alive until the weather breaks.  Not a job for cowards.<BR>Some parts are a tad slow, but then, this is one of those jobs that consists of months of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.  It's an essential element, and I didn't find it to detract from the read.<BR>My only complaint is that it seemed rushed into production and some technical errors slipped in.  An F-15 rarely seats two people, never side by side, and doesn't have an &quot;escape pod.&quot;  That sounds somewhat like an F-111, and if the rescue was off the coast of Britain in the 1980s, a likely actuality.  Obviously, Jack Brehm didn't make that mistake in print; it was probably an editor shuffling things around.  Likewise, some of the parachuting technicals mentioned don't match my jump experience.<BR>But then, this isn't a textbook for students, it's a view into the mind and lives of the men who risk death to save others, amidst the families, organizations and rivalry and the occasional mockery of wannabes.  Well worth the read.<BR>As to &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; reference, there has to be some way to relate the content to a casual reader who would otherwise think of &quot;Pajamas&quot; when hearing &quot;PJ.&quot;<BR>It's &quot;Pararescue Jumper,&quot; and they and the pilots and the Coasties are all on the same team.	2003-12-20

What happens to someone who visits a society where sickness is unknown, and is immediately imprisoned in a hermetically sealed environment against contamination?  These questions and more are discussed in stories that read at a breakneck pace.  <br />Forty years later, the questions are still timely and relevant, and can be considered in relation to &quot;reality&quot; TV and overprotectiveness and political correctness.  And Silverberg never takes the easy way out.  This is what science fiction is supposed to be--the future of the human spirit.<br />There is also a later edition with the same title, with a couple of additional stories added.  Both editions are well worth acquiring.	2003-11-04

The Air Force was not involved in any fashion.<br />So, she had an affair, broke a not-very-enforced reg that was held against her because of her attitude, and got screwed over by the military.  Find any twenty vets and you can find twenty-five stories like this.  As with any large organization, bureaucracy or government operation, and the Air Force is all three, mistakes happen, are misread, are punished or forgotten, depending on who's involved.  <br />It's not a badly written book, and she's certainly entitled to tell her story and make a few bucks--this is America.  But I can get a dozen stories like this at any unit reunion, and have a beer while listening.<br />Let's face it:  had she not been on the news, no one would have cared at all.  In fact, how many people remember her now?  <br />I'm not ashamed to have served in the same branch as she, but I see no reason to blame the Air Force for enforcing a reg it clearly explains to all personnel.  Again:  ask any vet.  We all got shafted in some fashion.  All of us, including Lieutenant Flinn, have moved on.	2003-11-03
