David Reynolds tells the story of Churchill's memoirs, how they came to be, how they reflected and deferred from what actually happened, and what their influence has been. <br /> <br />Churchill had contemplated writing his memoirs while serving as Lord of the Admiralty and as Prime Minister during the War.  After the first world war, Churchill had written \\"The World Crises\\" which Lord Balfour had described as \\"Winston's brilliant autobiography, disguised as a history of the universe\\" (quoted on p.5).  Churchill clearly thought to use his material later, going to lengths to mark his telegrams \\"personal\\" as to override official secret policies (p.28).  Since before the war, Churchill was prone to statements such as \\"History will say that the Right Honorable Gentleman was wrong in this matter.  Pause.  Broad grin \\"I know it, because I shall write that history\\". (pp. 37-8).  Thus, Churchill's conduct during WW2 was to some extent influenced by his intention to later officially record it. <br /> <br />Rather than a personal memoir, \\"The Second World War\\" was a history of the conflict, centered upon Churchill and structured around his memories and war time memos, it nonetheless explored most aspects of the War.  Churchill headed a complex operation (dubbed \\"the syndicate\\") of researchers, historians, ex-soldiers and bureaucrats, who did most of the writing.  Among Reynolds's most fascinating insights is that Churchill's memoirs were an \\"unofficially official\\" history of the Second World War, promoted by and encouraged by Whitehall as a way to get Britain's version of the War across.  Senior Civil Servants played an important role in the memoirs, allowing the publication of a mass of documents and even writing some of the text.  <br /> <br />Churchill's History is biasedin several ways:  Perhaps inevitably, Churchill tends to make himself more far sighted in retrospect.  His account in \\"The Gathering Storm\\", of his war against appeasement, makes him seem a much stauncher opponent of appeasement much earlier then he really had been.  Similarly, following the Fall of France, Churchill had privately had doubts about the possibility of final victory.  But his histories follow his public persona and emphasis his belligerency.  Churchill excuses the Norway invasion, and generally casts himself in a positive light. <br /> <br />Unlike most memoir writers, Churchill had been a prominent politician and a world statesman when writing \\"The Second World War\\" - the last volume was written while he was prime minister for the second time.  Thus the memoirs were \\"Diplomatic history\\", history that was very careful not to hurt Britain's interests or insult allies (particularly Eisenhower).  Churchill was very conscious of writing for the present and the future, not for the past. <br /> <br />Reynolds' book recounts all this and much more.  It covers Churchill's financial benefits from the books (between 18 and 50 million dollars in current terms, pp. 533-534), his working habits (which included 'working vacations' at the publishers' expense) and the critical reactions to the book - overwhelmingly, but not unanimously, favorable.  Throughout Reynolds' book is always well written, and much of it is fascinating, but it does have the draw back of getting into unnecessary details, dissecting all kinds of quarrels between Churchill ad his various generals or officials, or going at length about the inaccuracies in description of minor military operations.  Much of Reynolds' book is commentary on Churchill, and might have been more useful as annotation than as a self sustained monograph, particularly for those, like me, who have only a general knowledge of WW2 and who have not read Churchill's 6 volumes. <br /> <br />Of all the major war leaders Churchillwas the one who had published his memoirs soon after the War; Hitler, Roosevelt and Mussolini had died before the war ended.  Stalin published nothing, while De Gaulle delayed publishing until the late 1950s.  This is partly why, Reynolds considers Churchill to have been \\"In Command of History\\"    He suggests that Churchill had ruled historiography ever since, at least in the English speaking nations.   <br /> <br />But throughout, Churchill's account has been contested; He has not managed to convince the public at large that he was an enthusiastic about Overlord, nor to achieve unanimous support for his actions in Yalta.  His attempt to pin the blame for the 'appeasement' of the Soviets on the American military command following the Normandy invasion had failed, and his marginalization of the Eastern front could not outlast the Cold War.  For all his greatness, Churchill could no more command the War of History as he could control the War in Asia and in Europe.	2005-09-25

First thing's first;  Alister McGraith is an enlightened, educated, informed Christian apologetic;  I might be demonstrating nothing but my own prejudice here, but I rarely encounter such credible theistic advocates;  While I often disagree with McGraith, and I think that he sometimes entirely misses the atheist's serve, his legs are planted firmly in the playing field.    McGraith offers the first book length critique of biologist Richard Dawkins' atheistic philosophy.  Remarkably, he hardly addresses the main arguments Dawkins raises against theism.  Instead, McGraith launches all out attack on Dawkins's weakest arguments, while ignoring the best of them.  McGraith similarly ignores atheists like Daniel Dennett, who offer substantial criticism of theism similar to Dawkins's, but more sophisticated.  Since Dennett's brilliant \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" can be characterized as one long diatribe against God, ignoring Dawkins's chief academic supporter is surprising (Dennett is mentioned 3 times, on points unrelated to his atheistic views).  McGraith also spends much of the book on irrelevant asides, like an examination of Darwin's religious views, a detailed critique of Dawkins' concept of memes, and the history of Science and Religion.    McGraith's strongest attack regards the argument from Design.  Darwinian evolution offers a crashing counter argument for the famous theistic argument from design -that God is the only possible explanation for the complexity we see around us (also known as \\"the Watchmaker argument\\").  McGraith correctly points out that the failure of the Watchmaker argument does not disprove the existence of God - merely the weakness of one argument.  Indeed, for some theistic interpretations, a naturalistic explanation in the Darwinian vain is not complementary, but a necessity.      Furthermore, McGraith points out that the argument from Design is not a traditional Christian argument, but an 18th century development.  By the early 19th century, the watchmaker argument was \\"an outmoded way of thinking\\" (p. 65).  Due to various weaknesses of the design argument, particularly the problems with the idea that God had designed the crueler aspects of the world, prominent Christians such as John Henry Newman opposed it even before Darwin (p.67).    But McGraith's reasonable defence is over extended.  First, McGraith makes much of the fact that \\"Science leads neither to atheism nor Christianity - the scientific method is incapable of delivering a decisive adjudication of the God question\\" (p. 53).  This is true, but highly misleading.  Science cannot answer the God question, but there is nothing sacrosanct about science.  For a variety of historical and methodological reasons, science is defined in such a way as to not answer the ultimate questions; But that's neither here nor there; The same kind of reasoning indicates that God played no larger a role in the creation of the Earth as she did in the creation of the peacock's tail; We call the second conclusion science and the first metaphysics or philosophy, but that's little more than a play on words.  Right or wrong, the argument against God as cannot meaningfully be dismissed as \\"unscientific\\".    McGraith ignores the major implication of Darwinism on the explanatory power of atheism.  After Darwin, atheists only need to assume a very simple universe:  we know how complicated life forms can evolve from simplicity.  But a theist has to assume the pre existence of an all powerful creator.  Occham's razor is clearly on the atheist's side.    McGraith's other successful attack is on Dawkins's linkage between religion and violence.  Dawkins argues that religion causes great harm; McGraith counter argues that religion also brings great good, and that atheism's record is every bit as mixed as that of Christianity or Islam.    McGraith rightly points out that goodness and badness has very little to do with one's metaphysical persuasion: \\"there seems to be something about human nature which makes our belief systems capable of inspiring both great acts of goodness and great acts of depravity\\" (p.114).    What if we conclude that religiosity has little to do with morality (Contra the so-called Reagan doctrine and ideas of theist philosophers like C. Stephan Layman)?  That sits perfectly with an atheist model of the universe, but doesn't correspond to a Christian one.  After all, atheism only implies that there is no God; it says nothing about morality.  But Christianity assumes that its followers are doing God's will, and are striving to the best of their ability to adhere to his ways: shouldn't that effort show some results?    Although McGrath does indeed elaborate on \\"Genes, memes, and the meaning of life\\", his book is very short of talking about God, Dawkins' or otherwise.  Thus he ignores the Dawkins' strongest critique of theism - that it is false.  Even barring all the other objections to God's existence, it is up to its proponents to defend the concept, just as was up to Darwin to promote the concept of Natural Selection, and for Dawkins to persuade us of the legitimacy of the \\"Gene's viewpoint of the world\\".  No such defence is offered anywhere in the 159 pages of Dawkins' God.    McGrath may counter that his is not an evangelic book in the conventional sense, and that the task of validating theism is left for another day.  But when a leading advocate of Christianity, despite all of his knowledge and sophistication, fails to make the case for it, one wonders.	2005-09-08
US	51630889	R2HQM3T33GLAUM	0394341783	543318792	Era of Expansion 1800-1848	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	Before the Storm	Don E. Fehrenbacher, a preeminent historian of Antebellum America, offers a survey of the United States in its Jeffersonian and Jacksonian periods - from the \\"Revolution of 1800\\" In which Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist incumbent John Adams and became the third president of the United States, and until the aftermath of the American-Mexican War, and the sectional crises that emerged from it. <br /> <br />For Fehrenbacher, who has written some of the most reverting books of American history, including a brilliant monograph on the rise of Abraham Lincoln, a Pulitzer prize winning study o the Dred Scot Case, and a study of the U.S. government's relations with slavery, \\"The Era of Expansion\\" is a surprisingly mundane affair - it's a by the numbers historical book, the kind you will read for a high school or a not particularly advanced college course (indeed, based on the underlines in my used copy, I'm fairly certain mine was so used). <br /> <br />\\"The Era of Expansion\\" covers virtually all aspects of American Life at the time, from Art and Architecture to Economics, Science and Religion, but the main thread is the national level politics.  This is Fehrenbacher's forte, and even though I've read much of his stuff before, he will, as always, offer some new insights.  Here Fehrenbacher observes how in both the Missouri crisis and in the crisis of 1850 the presidential campaign had nothing to do with the real agenda that was a sectional struggle about slavery. <br /> <br />The main thesis here is that the era of expansion saw the birth of several issues that would play a spectacular part in later American history, but that at the moment remained relatively dormant.  The period saw the beginning of the industrial revolution and of Garrisonian abolitionism, of sectional conflict and of the rise of independent American intellectual, economic and artistic traditions.  It was all the time of mass immigration and the beginning of Nativist politics - all trends that would intensify in the 1850s, and particularly during and after the Civil War. <br /> <br />By far the best chapter of the book is the final one, which explores the historiography of the \\"Era of Expansion\\", dealing especially Frederick Jackson Turner's \\"Frontier Thesis\\" (that the Frontier was \\"safety valve\\" guaranteeing America's equality and democratic tendencies), Charles Beard's economic determination (which saw the changes in America as primarily the result of struggles between various economic interest groups), and their various successors, who attempt to forge a more subtle, yet sufficiently \\"grand\\", narrative. <br /> <br />While \\"The Era of Expansion\\" is an adequate narrative of the United States in the first half century of its existence, and is enlivened by Fehrenbacher's literary skills and historical perception, it is ultimately a fairly standard and unsatisfactory account.  It'll give the facts, but there's little spirit in it.	2005-07-16

Alone among the non Western nations it has mastered Western science, technology, and economic prowess, and had earned a place among the major world powers in the pre WW2 world.  Then it has joined in with Hitler and Mussolini as part of the Axis power, unleashing a gruesome campaign against its weaker Asian neighbors and a suicidal one against the United States.  Following its defeat, Japan reemerged as a pacifist democracy and an economic and cultural world leader.<br /><br />Ian Buruma's fascinating little book about the century between Perry's arrival and the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, has to cover a lot of ground in 160 pages (he has about 1.5 pages per year).  His book is necessarily frustrating in its gloss of important aspects, but he nonetheless supplies a useful account of Japan's political history throughout the period (and, surprisingly, quite a lot about Japanese culture as well, particularly the Cinema).<br /><br />It seems redundant to summarize the political developments in Japan; Suffice to say that, rather then a confrontation between traditionalists and modernists; Buruma sees a conflict between modernists of the Liberal and illiberal kind.  The latter, drawing upon the German model, transformed Shinto into a state religion celebrating a divine emperor, created a highly militaristic state, and led Japan into a series of Military adventures, from the Sino-Japanese war of 1895, through the war with Russia in 1905, the 'Manchurian incident' in 1931, and finally to Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />Following Japan's inevitable defeat, The American occupation force purged the hardliner military leaders, but maintained Emperor Hirohito (Buruma is inconclusive as to the level of his culpability in Japan's militarism).  It created a new Constitution (dedicated to Pacifism), and partially, but not entirely, reshaped Japan's political culture.  After some turbulence, the conservative Liberal-Democratic Party settled to rule Japan fairly effectively, partially betraying and partially fulfilling the Liberal hopes from the Post War era.<br /><br /> As interesting as Japan's political history has been, the extraordinary question of Japanese history is economic:  How did Japan manage to twice rise from great disadvantages to a position as a world leader?  How did Japan, alone among all non Western nations, manage to Industrialize as early as the 19th century, and how come it is today a leading member in the still almost exclusively Western club of developed countries?<br /><br />Buruma hardly addressed these questions, and as such his ability to explain the history of Japan suffers greatly.  As interesting as the political and ideological history is, that's not where the story of Modern Japan truly is; Japan's triumph, and current difficulties are hardly addressed, and Buruma mostly sees the enrichment of post war Japan as a distraction, \\"Opium to the Masses\\", so to speak, allowing the conservatives to shrink from fuller Liberalization of Japan (pp. 166-167).<br /><br />The best insight Buruma offers to Japan's extraordinary success is in the Prologue, describing the Judo contest in the 1964 Olympics.  The Japanese expected their smallish Judo champion, Kaminaga Akio to defeat his six foot six Dutch opponent, Anton Geesink.  Such a victory would have signaled the \\"superiority of Japanese culture, of the Japanese spirit\\".  (p.6)<br /><br />But in the end, Geesink won.  The Dutchman defeated the Japanese: \\"Once again, Japanese manhood had put to the test against superior Western manhood, and once again it was found wanting\\".  But the humiliation subsided when Geesink showed the proper respect by bowing the traditional bow.  \\"Geesink... would be treated as a hero in Japan forever after...  One quality has stood out to serve Japan better than any other: the grace to make the best of defeat\\".<br /><br />I think Buruma has hit upon a major element in Japan's success.  Unlike many other traditional societies, Japanese were able to accept the victories of the West and to profit from them; I think people around the world have much to benefit by reflecting upon the Japanese capacity of Embracing Defeat.><br />I think Buruma has hit upon a major element in Japan's success.

US	51630889	R1MZNKY8W69VS8	1400033802	777768730	The Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason	Books	4	4	7	N	Y	Crucifying Reason	For a thousand years, between late antiquity and the Copernican revolution, the West went into a \\"Dark Age\\", a period in which the scientific and inquisitive spirit of the ancient world disappeared, and the wisdom of old, maintained in the Arab world, was unknown in Europe.  In seeking to explain the disappearance of the rational tradition, Charles Freeman takes us on a wonderful odyssey of the intellectual, political and spiritual world of the Roman Empire.    At its finest, Freeman's is one of the best books on the evolution of the ancient world, from Humerian myth, through Alexander's regime (of whom Freeman is extremely critical), the rise of the Roman Republic and the emergence, triumph and disintegration of the Empire, ending in partition to two separate political entities.  Freeman charts the progress of Christianity in this context, from the cult of Jesus Christ (Freeman attempt to reconstruct his life is impressive but controversial.  The layers of myth are too thick for us to penetrate, and Freeman almost acknowledges as much p. 105), through the struggles of Paul, through the Pagan prosecutions and years of martyrdom and to its eventual triumph following the conversion of Constantine.    For the most part, the account is enlightening and well written, incorporating politics, theology, Art history and biography of the major personalities.  I did think that Freeman underplayed the role of Paul as synthesizer of Gnosticism, Mystery Cultism and Judaism into Christianity, and the similarities between Christianity and other contemporary religions, particularly Mithraism.  As a consequence, we never really understand the why of Christianity's growth.  Christianity's remarkable ability to survive prosecution and to outmaneuver its competition is hardly addressed.    Minor misgivings aside, Freeman's account is masterly, and it establishes a provocative thesis:  That an anti-intellectual Christian tradition, dating back to Paul (\\"the more [non Christians] called themselves philosophers, the more stupid they grew\\", Paul's letter to the Romans, quoted on p. 120), merged with anti-empiricist Greek tradition (Platonism), and with the need for stricter orthodoxy once Christianity has become a state religion (because \\"true Christians\\" now stood to receive Earthly as well as heavenly rewards), were behind the war on rational thinking and the \\"Closing\\".      Personally, one of the most interesting aspects of Freeman's book was the idea that among the ancient Greeks there was already a tradition, associated with Aristotle, of inquiry based on collection of data and falsification of theories (p. 18).  I always considered the scientific method to be among the greatest triumphs of the early Enlightment; it is interesting to discuss the extent to which the rationalist achievements of the Moderns were foreshadowed by the Greeks.      But along with the empiricist tradition of Aristotle, a second, and possibly more pervasive tradition was that of Plato, according to which disputes would be settled not by appeal to nature, but by pure reason.  \\"We shall approach astronomy, as we do geometry, by way of problems, and ignore what's in the sky, if we intend to get a real grasp of astronomy\\" Plato wrote (quoted on p. 31).  Because of certain evolution in Platonic thought, Plato's philosophy proved highly amenable to incorporation in Christian thought, as attested already in the Gospel of John (the platonic term \\"logos\\" translated into \\"the Word\\", is equated with Jesus).    When Constantine and his followers increasingly incorporated Christianity into the Roman Empire, different streams of Christianity rivaled for acceptance as the \\"one, true Church\\" leading to such protracted debates [at times settled by force] as to whether Jesus and God are better described as homoiousios or homoousios (of 'similar' and 'identical' substance, respectively, pp. 180-181).    Freeman is convincing both in his description of the evolution of Christian ideology andof the interrelation between politics and theology.  But when coming to explain the 'Closing of the Western Mind\\", Freeman's outlook is too focused.  Surely any account of the death and rebirth of Western science has to take into account the economic, military and politic circumstances.  The Fall of Reason has something to do with the Rise of Faith, but both are much affected with such prosaic occurrences as the breakdown of the Pax Romana, the failure of communication, the deterioration of roads and the shrinking economy.  The Fall of Reason was but one strand in the great drama of late antiquity - the destruction of the political order, and the fall of the Roman Empire.	2005-06-18

Mosier is critical about the \\"conventional wisdom\\" of WW2 interpretation - but he is hard pressed to actually explain what it is.  There is, he argues, something wrong in the concept he calls \\"breakthrough\\" - that fast moving tanks will cut through the enemy defenses and attack the rear of the population.  He also argues against the concept of strategic air power - destroying nation's ability and will to fight by bombing its industry and civilian population.  At times, he attacks a host of other - dare we call them mini myths? - For instance, the abilities of General Patton (\\"the great dash across France that had established him as a tanker par excellence has been accomplished without any real opposition\\" p. 259).    The central myth of Mosier's, though, carefully concealed until the end of the book, is that technology matters at all.  \\"The only real lesson to be derived by the Second World War\\" Mosier writes \\"is that advances in technology do not really change the basic principles of warfare\\".    I find this claim quite astounding.  I'm far from an expert on the second world war, but it seems clear that the central novelty was the new technology of tanks, properly engaged (that is, combined with infantry and anti-antitank weapons) supported by aerial superiority - tactics that might have been available in the Spanish Civil War, but hardly before that (indeed, the Spanish Civil War is conspicuously absent from Mosier's narrative of Military technology, tactics and thought in the 1930s).  Weren't these the causes of Germany's brilliant triumph over Poland?    Poland's army was approximately as large as the German army, but Germany had twice as many tanks and four times as many airplanes as Poland.  Isn't that the most natural explanation for Poland's defeat?  It seems like the novel military technology made Poland's army obsolete. (pp. 64-66)    Not to Mosier it doesn't.  Instead, the root of Poland's failure was in \\"Politics not Tactics\\" (p. 63) the major reason for Poland's defeat was not its technological inferiority - it was the Polish government's dependence upon the allies, and in particular the French, to mobilize within two weeks of a German invasion.  The expectation, Mosier writes was \\"not unreasonable\\"; The Polish expected that if they held out for two weeks, the French counter attack would force the Germans to retreat (Ibid.)    I know next to nothing about Poland's government's response to the outbreak of the war, but the expectation of swift allies response was everything but \\"not unreasonable\\".  The British and the French sat through a series of German aggressions, from its quitting the League of Nation and rearmament, invasion of the Rhineland, Anschluss with Austria and, of course, takeover of Czechoslovakia in the aftermath of the Munich agreement.  In the event, if the Polish government did depend upon Allies assistance, they rival the Trojans in the scoreboard of the political March of Folly.    Equally unsubstantiated is Mosier's contention that strategic airpower had failed.  Never mind that Strategic Bombing completely destroyed Japan - by 1944, the allies has achieved air superiority over Europe.  80 percent of the bombs dropped on Germany were dropped after the first of January 1944 (p. 202).  1944 also marked the sharp decline of Germany's war production.  Although this would seem to indicate that strategic bombing was successful, it is possible to argue that the one did not cause the other; that the failure of Germany's industries was due more to loss of territory then to the bombings.  But one has to actually marshal some facts in order to do so; Mosier merely asserts this central claim of his in half a paragraph and a single footnote, and then has the Chutzpa to put this under the sub header \\"Anatomy of Failure\\".    Not only are Mosier's arguments questionable, his opponents may very well be straw men.  Mosier will frequently utter something like \\"the picture so frequently drawn... is not real\\" or \\"Contrary to general belief...\\" without referring to a single source drawing the pictures or holding the beliefs.  More often then not, the sinners in Mosier's account are hidden, while the offences made are insubstantial and narrow (like claiming that Richard Overy's [[ASIN:0393322971 The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality]] implies that antiaircraft missiles did not down any Luftwaffe airplanes p. 206, n. 9).    Finally, I'm not sure how trustworthy Mosier's facts are.  Mosier sites David Irving's discredited figure of two hundred thousand dead for the Dresden Bombing (p. 203).  That number is an order of magnitude too large and Irving's misuse of evidence in this instance is about as well documented as these things go (see Richard Evans's refutation of it in [[ASIN:0465021530 Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial]]).  Thus I would question the reliability of any evidence raised by Mosier.    In short, Mosier's book is unclear in conception, unconvincing in argument and unreliable in matters of fact.	2005-05-04
US	51630889	R1MFF7OPXYM8C3	0268017522	961505950	Shape Of The Good: Christian Reflections on the Foundation of Ethics	Books	3	3	6	N	Y	Morality Ex Machina	In Greek and Roman Theater, plays would often resolve with God coming down in a machine to rescue the protagonists.  This kind of plot device became so infamous, it got its own name: Deus Ex Machine, referring to any resolution to a story which does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic and is so unlikely it challenges suspension of disbelief, allowing the author to end it in the way he or she wanted. <br /> <br />In his interesting and well written book, C. Stephen Layman employs God as a way out of several moral dilemmas.  Layman rejects the kind of philosophy books out of which you come with the feeling that \\"none of the theories work\\" (p.5).  Unfortunately, Layman's Deus Ex Machina is no more satisfying then that of dramatists, authors and playwrights. <br /> <br />The best parts of the book are Layman's discussions and criticism of several moral philosophies, from Subjectivism to Utilitarianism, including such Christian outlooks as \\"merely\\" following the Ten Commandments.  Throughout, Layman's presentation is lucid, and his criticism sharp and to the point.  You may squabble with one argument or another, but the heart of it is solid: When presenting theories that are complete, (such as Utilitarianism, the view that we should seek to maximize utility, or happiness), the results at times clash with what we feel to be morally right.  But the alternative theories merely beg the question, by being open ended: they are \\"parasitic\\" on a deeper understanding of good (p.94). <br /> <br />Layman's solution to the problem of what is good is, in my opinion, no solution at all.  Layman proposes that \\"An act is right if and only if it promotes the Kingdom of God\\" (p. 123).  But what exactly does \\"promoting the Kingdom of God\\" entails?  Well, it's about having \\"harmonious relations\\" with God, our fellow humans, and the world at large.  What are \\"harmonious relations?\\"  They're not so easy to define.  Ultimately, in Layman's formulation, an act \\"promotes the Kingdomof God\\" if it is right, and is right if it promotes the Kingdom of God.  For example, in Layman's view, donating a kidney to a stranger may not always \\"promote the Kingdom of God\\" and thus may be the wrong thing to do! (pp. 162-165) <br /> <br />Actually, I sympathize with Layman's position.  I think morality is an emergent phenomenon (pp. 144-145).  That is, it evolved with Human beings, and has a biological base to it.  Since human morality, like everything human, has evolved to function in Africa rather than to be taught at Notre Dame University, all attempts to make a systematic mapping of morality will inevitably have exceptions. <br /> <br />What I disagree with is Layman's claim that \\"the institution of morality is justified only if it pays (in the long run) for the individuals who participate in it\\" (p. 153).  \\"If being moral does not pay for individuals\\" Layman explains \\"morality is ... nothing more than a mechanism for keeping social order... a kind of propaganda for the collective\\" (p. 169).  God is thus the ultimate, all-knowing, necessary policeman, rewarding all good and punishing any evil. <br /> <br />Why should we give up morality and accept it as merely selfishness?  If we reckon that morality is rational from the community's point of view, can't we selflessly endorse it?  In practice, selfish theism does not create superior morality (see Isaac Asimov's devastating critique of the so-called \\"Reagan Doctrine\\"), Why surrender to it as an ideal? <br /> <br />In the final chapter, Layman makes a repeat performance - he first criticizes most arguments for natural, inalienable rights, than promotes a concept of human rights based on Christianity.  Since morality is the duty to 'promote the Kingdom of God', people have the rights associated with that duty, like the rights of life, freedom from necessity, and freedom from assault.  People have these rights because: \\"one's capacity to participate in the Kingdom of God in its earthly stage is plainly tied to one's degree of physical well-being\\" (p. 187, italics in the original) <br /> <br />But why should people have the right to promote the Kingdom of God in its \\"earthly stage\\" but not the right to promote the Kingdom of God in, say, France? Killing people does not prevent people from the pursuit of the Kingdom of God as such; it merely forces them to do so in another life.  Similarly, the Kingdom of God is a poor basis for other rights.  If people can pursue the Kingdom of God in prison - and presumably they can, or else Layman's discussions on how to improve prisons make no sense (pp. 208-209) - why should people have the right to Liberty?  Similarly, where are the rights for privacy and freedom of Speech in this model? <br /> <br />Furthermore, Layman's criteria lay an intolerable burden on human beings.  \\"It can[not] be avoided that [sustenance] rights are positive... we do not have the right to hoard surplus wealth or to squander it on extravagant, needless luxuries\\" (p. 201).  But this implies more than \\"that most American Christians have a duty to give some of their income\\" to charity.  How can you go to the movies or own a TV when people are starving?  How can you go on vacation when the money could help starving children in Africa?  Unless you define \\"non-extravagant luxuries\\" so broadly as to include virtually everything, the entire way of life of almost all people in the West is immoral under Layman's criteria. <br /> <br />There are no easy answers to these kinds of questions, but that is exactly the point; Ethics is not like Mathematics, the logical extension of a few axiomatic principles.  Rather, like Science and Religion and the Law, it is a human abstraction for a variety of practices, ideas and methods.  The study of ethics can tell help us illuminate moral questions and clarify difficult questions, but it cannot find some illusive 'essence' of goodness, because there is none.  In the end, that is the futility of the quest for theistic morality.	2005-04-03

Freehling calls for a new, 'reintegrated' American history, merging social, political and military history, in his fascinating essay collection, which follows the evolution of the Slavocratic South in roughly chronological order: the second essay deals with the Founding Fathers' attitudes towards slavery, while the later ones map Southern history to Appomattox.      The main thread through Freehling's essays is the conflict he sees between two incompatible Southern ideologies: Paternalism - the view that a Southern Slavocracy has to guide not only black slaves and white women, but also 'lesser' white men; and what he calls Herrenvolkism, or white supremacy - the notion, associated with Andrew Jackson, that America is the republic of equal white men.       Most exciting is Freehling's description of a tendency - one may almost say conspiracy - by Southern Paternalists to undermine the main instrument of the Herrenvolk ideology, the Jacksonian Democratic party, and replace it with a solid, Paternalistic, anti-antislavery South.  The prime suspect is Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur, who commenced the struggle for the annexation of Texas as a way to awaken Southern consciousness: \\"There is [a] systematic conspiracy against the South and its institution...\\" Upshur wrote \\"[t]he South will be deceived... and will wake up, only to find itself powerless\\".  Upshur saw the danger in \\"Northern Politicians... ever ready to sacrifice both political and moral principle\\" (quoted on pp. 126-128).  Abel Upshur considered Herrenvolk democracy untrustworthy because not all Southerners had slave property and thus a stake in the system.  Instead, they could be deluded by Jacksonian demagogues.  (pp. 130-131).  The Texas annexation issue was thus, at least partially, a measure against the Democratic Party.    Possibly because Freehling's research covers such long periods, he downplays the role of contingencies.  In his discussion of the causes of Southern defeat in the Civil War, Freehling criticizes historians such as James McPherson, who believe that the outcome of the Civil War was dependent upon battlefield victories.  \\"[M]ilitary narrators [argue]... military outcomes shaped social outcomes, not vice versa, and military outcomes might easily have been reversed\\".  Freehling convincingly argues that regardless of the outcome of Antietam, British pro Southern Military intervention was unlikely, and that even had George McClellan won the 8164 presidential elections, the war for the Union would have continued (pp. 224-228).  Freehling locates social causes for Southern defeat: the defection of upper South whites and of blacks to the North.      Here Freehling fails to differentiate between the circumstances of the war and the causes for the defeat.  In the 1850s, the sectional conflict was between Southerners and Northerners - but in the 1860s, the American Civil War raged between the eleven states of the Confederacy and the rest of the United States.  Did Southerners lose the war before they began to fight it because of their political failure to win the allegiance of the Boarder South?    Possibly, but Freehling should prove it.  When the war broke, the Confederates had several advantages: 2 million square kilometers of territory that the North had to conquer, some of the best soldiers in the United States, experienced leadership, and most important, it had to merely defend itself in an age of war technology advantageous to the defense.  Certainly, the task was onerous, but Freehling hardly considers the failure to devise means corresponding to the ends: the failure of strategy.    Unlike the Northern 'Anaconda Plan', which was tailored to the North's strengths and the South's weaknesses, the South's strategy, as far as there was one, made absolutely no sense - the South spent its precious manpower and best commanders on pointless invasions of the North along the Eastern front, while allowing Grant to defeat them in the West.  Had the South chosen a defensive strategy, forcing the North to waste its power against heavy artillery in the bulwarks, the war might have ended very differently.  By 1863, the Confederacy might have been doomed - but that was due to defective leadership, not necessarily to the long patterns of Southern history.    Similarly, Freehling does not distinguish between the South's reasons to press for strict Fugitive Slave Laws and for largely symbolic victories in Kansas and Nebraska from the reasons for Southern secession in 1860 (p. 143).  Historians' consensus on the second question is clear: Southerners left the Union because the Republican Revolution meant that the Union was no longer in Slaveholder's hands, and thus no longer safe for slavery.  But why did Southerners, by forcing proslavery measures, undermine the antebellum two party system and thus their control of American politics?    Freehling offers an intriguing partial answer:  Southerners feared that increasing Fugitives from Boarder states would undermine slavery in the Upper South, and that, as the rates of slavery in the boarder states would decline, 'demagogues' - that is, anti-slavery advocates - would triumph in them, leading to the eventual abolition of slavery throughout the United States.  Similarly, the agitation to reopen the slave trade was to solve the dwindling of slavery in the upper South (p.210).  Thus the pro-Slavery campaigns were rational, if miscalculated, reactions to the social disunity of the South.    This is part of Freehling's campaign for a 'reintegrated' American History - \\"the whole socio/political/military history flow[ing] in one piece\\" (p. 274).  I find two flaws in Freehling's approach: it underemphasizes Economics, and it lacks systematic quantification.    Viewing slavery as an economic system offers two alternative explanations for the phenomena he described: that the higher productivity of slavery in the tropical lower South, not fugitive slaves and anti-slavery propaganda, caused the dwindling of slavery in the boarder regions, and that similarly, the booming lower South economy of the 1850s, and the shortage of slaves, were the roots of the agitation for reopening the slave trade.    The solution to both questions can not come from general sociology, from reading the mind of Southerners, or from political history.  The only way to answer these questions is a systematic quantitative approach.  As Colin McEvedy wrote: \\"History being a branch of the biological sciences, its ultimate expression must be mathematical.\\"	2005-03-29

Richard Evans is an accomplished historian, who has written about topics as wide apart as The Feminist movement and the death penalty in 19th century Germany, he is probably best known for his historiographical works:  [[ASIN:0393319598 In Defense of History]] was an interesting and illuminating, if somewhat unfocused book about the failure of relativism in history.  His book about his part in the David Irving trial, [[ASIN:0465021530 Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial]], was as insightful as any book about the sociology of the Holocaust and as much of a page turner as any legal thriller.<br /><br />Yet I have read none of Evan's histories, and his previous books were focused on particular movements or institutions.  How does he handle one of the best known, grandest topics in modern history, the rise to power of Adolf Hitler?<br /><br />Spectacularly, according to the cover.  This \\"magisterial new reckoning\\", by a \\"great historian\\", is a \\"masterwork of the historian's art... a book by which all others on the subject will be judged\\".<br /><br />Evans's work is badly treated by the overhyped desk jacket.  \\"The Coming of the Third Reich\\" is a competent historical work, with solid research covering almost every aspect of the period covered, whether politics, arts, economics or social trends.  Indeed, Evans's thoroughness as a researcher is at times a hindrance to his prowess as a storyteller - Evans indulges in information on peripheral issues, which distracts from his otherwise effective narrative.<br /><br />The central question of this volume is how the Nazi party could rise in Germany.  For some, German economics and Kultur make the rise of Nazism so inexplicable, but not for Evans.  \\"It is questionable to assume that it was somehow less likely for an economically advanced and culturally sophisticated society to fall into an abyss of violence and destruction... culture and politics simply do not infringe on each other in so simple and direct a manner\\" (p. xxiii).<br /><br />The elements of Nazism were already present in the post Bismarck, pre WW1 Germany under Wilhelm II.  Rabid nationalism, calling for pan-Germanism and annexation of the East, triumphant and paranoid at the same time;  Disdain for democracy, coupled with Romantic admiration of warfare and militarism; A Messianic cult of the leader, part Bismarck, part Friedriech the Great, who would bring unity and would shy away from neither violence nor coercion in pursuance of Germany's interests and honor.  The late 19th century saw the rise of Social Darwinism, misapplying the principles of evolution to human society and marrying them to simplifications of Nietzsche's philosophy.  Richard Wagner's nationalistic, bombastic music did not fail to effect wide circles in Germany and Austria, not least the young Adolf Hitler.  And anti-Semitism was widespread, both in paranoid fringe publications and in the mainstream: the Reich chancellor declared that \\"the Jewish question\\" contained \\"great dangers for Germany's further development\\". (Quoted on page 51).<br /><br />But before the Great War, these ideologies were not, on the whole, dominant.  The Social Democratic party, though harassed by the government, had more then one million members, was the largest political organization anywhere in the world, and the main victor of the 1912 elections.  (p. 14)<br /><br />Germany's defeat in the first World War and particularly the widespread belief that it was defeated on the home front, through a \\"dagger in the back\\" rather than on the battlefield, pushed these ideologies to the front.  Fearing violence from the Left rather than the Right, authorities in the Weimar republic were lenient on Nazi violence, and unwilling to genuinely suppress it.  The National Socialist Workers' Party, headed by the charismatic Adolf Hitler, expanded in power and in prestige.  Yet, as late as 1929, it was still \\"on the fringe of politics\\" (p. 230).  In 1928, it got only 2.6 percents of the Reichstag seats (p.446).  For all its flaws, Weimar democracy might have triumphed - but for the Great Depression.<br /><br />The masses of the unemployed and the shrinking economy undermined the public's trust in democracy.  The Communist party grew in membership and influence.  , The centrist Catholic Centre party and the Liberal party turned to the right.  The power of the Nazis rose, and the Social Democrats, who still retained a large section of their constituency, remained the only party committed to democracy.  The high unemployment weakened the power of the traditionally moderate leftist Unions, who could hardly afford to strike.<br /><br />The Nazi Party, with its amalgamation of anti-Communist and anti-Weimar ideology, and an image of youthful energy, became the largest party in the Reichstag.  Hitler refused to join a right wing coalition unless he was at its head (p. 302), and when attempts to rule through the Presidential powers of Hindenburg failed, nationalists turned to Hitler.<br /><br />As thorough as Evans's examination of the rise of Nazism is, it nonetheless fails to address the central question of how much of this Rise was peculiarly German, and how much was it a part of a wave of Fascist revolutions sweeping all over Europe.  There is surprisingly little Comparative analysis, and most of it consists of speculations or generalities (pp. 443-445).<br /><br />A related weakness is how little attention Evans pays to the man who is at the very heart of the Nazi Regime.  Adolf Hitler appears a lot in Evans's book (indeed, the mini-biography of his is one of the best I've read pp. 161-169) - but he hardly does anything.  The question of how the leader of the 'Nazi Revolution' helped shaped it is hardly addressed.  Evans's Hitler is more the symbol of German Nationalists than an active player.<br /><br />When the Nazis rose to power, they started 'purging' the Civil service, the Arts and the Sciences.  By dismissing Jews, Communists, Social Democrats, and other \\"non-socials\\", the Nazis complemented their campaign of terror. Their attitude was best summarized by an unintentionally ironic line in a pro-Nazi play: \\"When I hear 'culture', I release the safety catch of my Browning\\".  The reader knows where the purge led - but Evans's book, the first of a trilogy, ends implicitly with: \\"To Be Continued...\\"	2005-03-20
US	51630889	R1DCVOVS9EESF7	0140284265	420577031	Lloyd George: From Peace to War 1912-1916	Books	3	3	3	N	N	"Grip, Resolution, and Prompt readiness":Lloyd George in War	The British political world at the outbreak of the First World War was populated with remarkable personalities: Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith, Conservative leader Andrew Bonar Law, Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, economist John Maynard Keynes, and of course, above and beyond anyone else, Winston Churchill.  First among equal in the cabinet, \\"a team of ministers as gifted as any in British history\\" as John Grigg writes (p. 471), was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and future secretary of war and Prime Minister, David Lloyd George.    The third volume of John Grigg's life of David Lloyd George, subtitled 'From Peace to War', begins with his pre war campaigns for agrarian reforms and labor settlements.  By far the dullest parts of the book, the pre-war descriptions dwell upon what are by now utterly trivial political controversies.  Here and later Grigg seems to assume his reader has read his previous volumes, or at least is very much familiar with the British political situation in the early 20th century.  For this reader at least, this was not the case, and at times I felt at the dark.    Most interesting of the pre-war chapters is the one dedicated to Lloyd George's personal life and particularly to his affair with Frances Stevenson, his secretary, who was young enough to have been his daughter.  Lloyd George, though he needed and was much in love with his mistress, was unwilling to risk his political career by marrying her, and even went to the length of considering marrying her to a young protégé of his (pp. 398-401).  Stevenson agreed to the illicit relationship with Lloyd George, at least partly because, as his secretary, she had unique access to the political world.  Thus, Grigg writes that the marriage scheme \\"designed to protect his [Lloyd George's] career\\" may have failed \\"partly because she [Stevenson] sensed it as a threat to hers\\" (p. 400).    As the Great War approached, heralding the end of the Victorian world, Lloyd George and John Grigg's narrativerose to the top of their game.  As Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lloyd George was already intimately involved in the production of munitions, and he would soon become Minister of Munitions, making an invaluable contribution to the war effort.  As a military strategist, Lloyd George was an \\"Easterner\\" rather than a \\"Westerner\\"; he believed in making a strong engagement in the Balkans rather than throwing away manpower and resources in pointless offences such as the Somme.  Upon becoming Secretary of War, Lloyd George found himself as something of a figurehead in a department ran by the generals, pursuing a course he considered ill-advised, and hardly able to do much about it.    Besides his Ministerial duties, Lloyd George also played a central role in the government's temperance campaign, (although like most of the Cabinet but unlike the King, he refused to lead by example abstention pp. 230-233), in the campaign for better labor relations, and in the political maneuverings, resulting first in a coalition government, and later in the fall of Asquith's government.    John Grigg clearly admires Lloyd George, but he can be scathing in his criticism of his subject's failures, petty hypoacidity and various misjudgments.  He is particularly critical of Lloyd George's abandonment of a settlement reached with the Irish leadership following the 1915 Easter Uprising.  The agreement, which would have granted home rule to Ireland, was killed by Conservative MPs; thus passed what Grigg judges to have been the last chance for a British Ireland.    Some biographers use their subject for wide range commentary on the character's time and world (Fehrenbacher's brilliant book on Lincoln in the 1850s is a prime example), but John Grigg does not.  The focus is squarely on Lloyd George, and vital events are discussed only in so far as they affect him.  Grigg hardly discusses the reason the war broke, or the reason the United Kingdom went into it.  He writes that the UK didn't go to war for Belgium's sake, and that \\"her own survival\\" was at stake at the war (pp. 170-171).  But what threat did Imperial Germany constitute to Britain, and was the threat grave enough to justify the millions of dead that the war entailed?  Some historians (such as Niall Fergusson) answer in the negative, but Grigg hardly comes to grip with the question.  Nor, it is worth pointing out, does his Lloyd George.    In 'A Peace to End All Peace' David Fromkin's brilliant narrative of the Middle East in the second decade of the century, a rather different Lloyd George emerges - a bona fide British Imperialist, not the semi \\"American business man\\" reflected in the interview with US Journalist Roy Howard (p. 429).  That Lloyd George fought for the aggrandizement of the Empire - but it is hard to spot him in Grigg's account.    The book ends with the fall of the Asquith government and the formation of the Lloyd George administration.  Asquith, though an extremely able politician, was ineffective as war leader.  As the war lengthened and the slaughter brought no tangible results, demands for change intensified.  Asquith rejected a compromise which would have given Lloyd George de facto control of the war effort, and thus was forced to resign.  When he refused also to serve under Balfour or Andrew Bonar Law, Lloyd George's prime ministry was assured.    For all its flaws, John Grigg's biography tells the story of a great man in dire times, and his story is gripping.  Although I have no wish to go back to the earlier volumes, I'm sure I will read Grigg's final volume, published posthumously: [[ASIN:0140284273 Lloyd George: War Leader, 1916-1918 (Penguin Biography)]].	2005-03-09

Islam was both geographically and culturally close to the West.  It formed a wide ranging empire, reaching as far east as the Pacific and as far west as the Atlantic.  It was also the leader in the Arts and Sciences, and more pluralistic and accepting of minorities then was Christendom.  It encountered the great technological advanced of the west as they were taking place, and could adapt to them.  Compared to other world civilization, Islam suffered the least from Western Imperialism, which ruled the Islamic world only for a few short decades after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.  Finally, the Middle East received the last minute blessing of oil, a source of wealth which it could have used to modernize itself and its society.<br /><br />Yet Islam failed.<br /><br />Today, the Islamic world competes only with sub Saharan Africa as the greatest loser of the modern age.  Economically, it has been over taken not only by the West, but also by East Europe, Japan, east and south Asia, India and Latin America.  Barring oil, the total exports of the Arab world are less then those of Finland (p.52).  Scientifically, the former leaders of the world now make virtually no contribution, accept for individual scholars working in the West.  And militarily, the Islamic world has been defeated not only by the Christian empires (whether France in the 1800s, Britain in the First World War, and the United States in the first Gulf War), but also by a small and relatively poor Jewish nation.<br /><br />Bernard Lewis's wonderful, eminently readable book, \\"What Went Wrong: Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response\\" deals with all sorts of questions regarding the relations between the West and the world of Islam.  A historical survey of the last thousand years, and particularly the last 300-400 years, it deals with such wide ranging issues as slavery, clock-making, women's rights, and the influence (or lack of) of western music.<br /><br />In terms of answer to the failure of Islam to modernize, Lewis's views are interesting if not really original: other writers, notably David Landes, have suggested more or less the same remedies: Democracy, Capitalism, Science, and hard work.<br /><br />Lewis's insight is in the details: he offers a fascinating discussion of the separation of Church and State which is ingrained in Christian thought, but foreign to Islam.  There is no Islamic equivalent of \\"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's\\".  Under Islam (as under Judaism), \\"God was Caesar\\" (p. 108).  Christianity was formed as a suppressed, or tolerated, religion, and remained so until the conversion of Constantine, by which time its traditions were already well established.  But \\"Muhammad was, so to speak, his own Constantine\\" (p.110).  Until its importation from the west, in Islam there was no concept of spiritual and temporal domains.<br /><br />Another factor in Islamic backwardness is the status of women.  \\"The difference in position of women was indeed one of the most striking contrasts between Christian and Muslim practice, and is mentioned by almost all travelers in both directions\\", Lewis writes (p. 73).  \\"Muslim visitors to Europe speak with astonishment, often with horror, of the immodesty and forwardness of Western women [and] of the incredible freedom and absurd deference accorded to them\\" (ibid).  The relative liberation of women in the secular states of the Middle East is a \\"major target of different schools of militant Islamic revival\\" (p. 77).  But if the Muslim world is to catch up with the west, it cannot afford to give up half of its \\"manpower\\".<br /><br />When confronting their obvious weakness, some Muslims play the \\"blame game\\", whether blaming the Mongols, the French, the British, the Americans or the Jews.  Yet, as Lewis writes: \\"The question 'Who did this to us?' has led only to neurotic fantasies and conspiracy theories.  The other question - 'What did we do wrong?' - has led naturally to a second question: 'How do we put it right?' In that question, and in the various answers that are being found, lie the best hopes of the future.\\" (p.177).<br /><br />Thus there are two paths available for Islam: One is symbolized by Kemal Ataurk, the man who founded Modern Turkey and dragged it, sometimes kicking and screaming, towards Modernism.  The other is the violent Islam of Osama bin Laden.  Unfortunately, that is the path that the Middle East is currently pursuing.the Jews.

It covers the military, social and economic aspects of the IDF, touching on almost everything, be it the role of nuclear weapons in Middle East, gender roles in the IDF (most controversial is van Creveld's thesis postulating an inverse relationship between the role of women in the Army and its prestige p. 361), or the similarities between the IDF's strategy and that of the Whermacht.<br /><br />I often lament the shortages of maps in Military history books, but van Creveld's book is more offensive then most in this regard, normally there is only one map to each campaign, and I doubt anyone but the initiated can follow van Creveld's description of Israel's wars.<br /><br />I am no expert in Israeli military history, most of which I gather from reading Israeli newspapers, but I was particularly surprised of van Creveld's assertions that a main motive behind Nasser's commencement of hostilities in the Six Day War was his fear of the Israeli Nuclear program.  Van Creveld emerges as a critic of Israel's policy of nuclear policies, arguing that opacity failed to prevent the Six Day war and the Yom Kippur war (pp. 220-221).  As a cause for the Six-Day war, van Creveld hardly mentions the internal political consideration of the Arabs, particularly in Egypt (see Michael B. Oren's brilliant \\"Six Days of War\\" for a very different perspective).<br /><br />I never realized how limited the Egyptian military's moves were in the Yom Kippur war (van Creveld always refers to it as 'The October war').  In essence, Israel's maintenance of the Bar-Lev line, on the west bank of the Suez canal, was costly in terms of human life and military material, and made little or no strategic sense.  By fighting on the line, Israel subjugated itself to heavy anti-aircraft and anti-tank fire, and thus did not enjoy the superiority it had in mobile warfare as in the Six Days war and the 1956 war.  Israel utterly failed to take advantage of the strategic qualities of the Sinai desert as a barrier against attack on itself.<br /><br />The subtitle of \\"The Sword and the Olive\\" is \\"A Critical History\\", and critical it is.  Van Creveld does not spare criticism of the early pre State Israeli forces and personnel, as well as of Israel's army in the first twenty-five years of its existence, blaming Israelis for inciting Syrian fire on its tractors and questioning performances in the Six Day War.<br /><br />After the 1973 war, though, van Creveld's criticisms become truly devastating.  As heads of state, Golda Meir \\"frankly admit[ed] she did not know exactly what a division was\\", and Menachem Begin \\"kept meddling [with army affairs] even though his military knowledge had been acquired during his kindergarten years and barely developed thereafter\\" (p.  108).  Nor is van Creveld kinder to generals:  Moshe Dayan \\"failed to carry his point of view in the Cabinet\\" and \\"as usual\\" \\"found a way to shift responsibility [for the Bar Lev line] to others\\" (pp. 211-213).  General 'Motta' Gur's \\"greatest intellectual achievement[s]\\" were \\"a series of children's books about Azzit, a heroic shepherd she-dog\\" (p. 249).  The general intellectual poverty of the Israeli high command was manifested in Rafael Eytan \\"for whom wider cultural horizons simply do not exist\\" (p. 263).<br /><br />About the current state of the Israeli army van Creveld doesn't mince words.  The state of the Israeli moral is so devastating that the army had to suppress research about it.  \\"In an army that once prided itself on truthfulness, lying has become institutionalized\\" van Creveld writes (p. 350).  Great public outcry about accidents led to a pre-approbation of exercises and to a sharp decrease in the quantity and quality of training (p.349).  Indeed, the IDF has become \\"soft, bloated, frequently undisciplined and undertrained\\", and although every successive IDF chief of staff has promised to make the army \\"lean and mean\\" again, none delivered the promise (p. 318).<br /><br />Van Creveld has little doubt as to the cause of the malaise:  The Occupation and the war against the Palestinians.  \\"War... is an imitative activity in which... the two sides will learn from each other and tend to resemble each other.  Thus he who fights the weak will himself become weak, and he who by \\"fighting\\" the weak behaves like a coward will end up turning into one\\" (p.352).<br /><br />You do not have to agree with every point of van Creveld opinionated study in order to appreciate its knowledge and learning.  A Superb source about the IDF, \\"The Sword and the Olive\\" is a must read for anyone interested in Israel, the Middle East, or Military history.	2005-02-12

I devoured Joseph J. Ellis's Pulitzer winning masterpiece, [[ASIN:0375705244 Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation]] during my long awaited trip to America, where I visited many of the historical places of the American Revolution and Civil War.  Reading about the Adams-Jefferson meeting in Philadelphia's Market Street, while in a hotel room only a few blocks away was exhilarating.  The Independence Visitor Center bookstore contains many books about the American Revolution, and I was mighty tempted to buy Ellis's biography of the Philosopher King from Monticello.  Finally, my semi-principle of breaks between books by a single author won the day.  Only three months later did Amazon deliver \\"American Sphinx\\".<br /><br />Ellis's biography of Thomas Jefferson is not as good a book as \\"Founding Brothers\\".  I am not a big reader of biographies, so that may be part of it, but there is less content here than in \\"Founding Brothers\\".  The latter book is shorter and has a wider scope, and for the most part, the more in debt look on Jefferson doesn't give comparable insight.<br /><br />But \\"American Sphinx\\" is a very, very good book.  We encounter Jefferson in five periods of his life: Drafting the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia, watching the burgeoning French Revolution while trying in vain to promote American interests in 1780s Paris, Congealing the Anti-Federalist opposition from his rectitude in Monticello, Mastering American destiny in his first term as President of the United States, and Spending his last years in retirement, debt, and construction of the University of Virginia from 1816 to 1826.<br /><br />In all of the chapters, Ellis avoids strict chronology for a theme based approach, discussing political event (his opposition to Federalism, the Louisiana purchase), personal life (his did-they-or-didn't-they romance with Maria Cosway, quarrels and friendship with John Adams, and of course, the Sally Hemings scandal), interests (primarily architecture), and political philosophy (strangely Whiggish and unrealistic).<br /><br />I think the Jeffersonian Mind, as described by Ellis, is the most extraordinary element of his character.  Some people held Jefferson to be a hypocrite, adapting his message to different audiences.  Ellis, though, sees it as a capacity for self delusion.  Jefferson had a \\"deep distaste for sharp disagreement and [a] bedrock belief that harmony was nature's way of signaling the arrival of truth\\" (p. 106).  This capacity for self delusion allowed him to lead a political party while claiming that \\"If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all\\" (quoted on p. 124), it allowed him to deny having hired James Callander to character assassinate John Adams, even as he did exactly that, and most famously of all, it effected his treatment of slavery.<br /><br />The counterpoint of Jefferson dislike of argument was that he saw a great dichotomy between those on his side and the other side.  Jefferson saw the world in moral absolutes, the constant clashes of Good vs. Evil, with himself conveniently on the side of the angels.  Fighting George III's despotism and opposing the Federalists was part of the same struggle - of the \\"Pure Republicans\\" against the consolidationist, aristocratic monarchists.  That was always a strange position for the Aristocratic Jefferson to adopt, and always only tenuously connected with reality - but never less so then in his final years, when he had to cast in the role of the enemies the Northern opposers of the expansion of slavery.<br /><br />Jefferson managed to do just that.  Although he had proposed abolition of slavery throughout the territories of the Unites states back in the 1780s, and although he was responsible for the Louisiana purchase of 1803, Jefferson nonetheless saw the Missouri Crisis as a \\"fire bell in the night\\" (quoted on p. 306).  New York Congressman James Tallmadge's proposal to prohibit slavery in Missouri as a condition for its admission as a state was merely a \\"party trick\\".  Northern politicians cynically took \\"advantage of the virtuous feelings of the people\\" as a new cover in the quest for power, consolidation and despotism.  The angels were on the side of the lash.<br /><br />For me, one of the most intriguing things of Jefferson is this image - Jefferson the genuine radical, who could sincerely maintain his cherished illusions regardless of reality.  Of all the Founding Fathers, Ellis, suggests, Jefferson was the most radical one, believing in the true exercise of popular democracy, and of an eternal struggle between Good and Evil, of which he was the ultimate judge.  This is the Jefferson who boldly states: \\"The tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\\" (on p. 118).<br /><br />For all of its egalitarian and radical potential, the American Revolution was headed by pragmatic and practical leaders who led it towards stability and triumph.  But neither in temperament nor in thinking was Jefferson one of them.  Had he been born in another time, at another place, would Jefferson have been not an American Sphinx, but an American Lenin?	2005-01-15

Why did he back Bush into the war in Iraq, ostensibly in quest of weapons of mass destructions, even though the UN inspectors urged for more time? <br /> <br />As Blair followed George W. Bush, his popularity in the UK plummeted, his party is in something close to an open revolt, and his standing in Europe has deteriorated.  And for all his trouble, it appears that Blair got precious little in return from the American administration.  As French President Jacques Chirac recently put it \\"I am not sure that it is in the nature of our American friends at the moment to return favors systematically.\\" <br /> <br />British journalist James Naughtie, author of another acclaimed book about Tony Blair (the Rivals, about the relationship between Blair and Gordon Brown), tries to answer these questions precisely.  His answer is that Blair is a true believer; he believes that the 9/11 has been a wake up call for the world.  \\"I could see this Islamic Extremism... bring about a very dangerous conjunction of terrorism and states that are utterly unstable and repressive\\" (quoted on p. 203).  These views of Blair's antedated 9/11.  They were the impetus for his promotion of the Kosovo war.  Already in the late 1990s, Blair saw a new international order rising, one based on the struggle against evil.  The terrorist threat required a whole new political philosophy: <br /> <br />\\"Before September 11th the world's view of the justification of military action had been changing. The only clear case in international relations for armed intervention had been self-defence, response to aggression. But the notion of intervening on humanitarian grounds had been gaining currency\\" But after 9/11, \\"What had seemed inchoate came together.\\"  The need for security required preemptive action.   Countries which suppressed freedom, harbored terrorists or had weapons of mass destruction had to be dealt with.  In effect, Blair agreed with Condoleezza Rice's claim that \\"we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud\\". <br /> <br />So is the Labour PM really in accord with Bush, Cheyney and Rumsfeld?  In Naughtie's thorough discussion, it is not so simple.  There is a great difference between Bush and Blair.  Naughtie quotes Blair as saying \\"I never quite understand what people mean by that neocon thing\\" (p.71) <br /> <br />That may be the key to explain the great divide between Blair and the Bush administration.  Blair may not be aware of the gap, or of its enormity.  The Prime Minster believes in the importance of democracy.  For him, the military action against Iraq or El Qaeda is only a part of a greater attempt to create international security and peace.  \\"You cannot deal with terrorism security as simply a security issue.  You also have to deal with the more compassionate side of the issue... the poverty, the lack of interfaith understanding.  All these things need to be part of the agenda.\\"  Although Bush and his administration may pay lip service to these ideals, for them internationalism and real international cooperation are anathema.  They cannot possibly support them.   <br /> <br />In my view, Blair's partnership with Bush committed him to the Bush administration's incompetent, corrupt and extremist policies.  Naughtie seems to think that Blair's support was essential or at least important, to Bush (see for example p. 203).  But I disagree - in the Bush administration, the moderates, as Paul O'Neal observed, act as cover only.  Bush would use Blair for all he is worth - but he would concede nothing in return. <br /> <br />I have much sympathy for the ideology Blair advocates, but Bush is no partner for promoting it.  Blair's collaboration with the Bush administration not only diminishes his popularity - it also discredits his cause.	2005-01-05

First, he argues that war is a social institution, and that, like dueling or slavery (his two favorites examples), it can become obsolete, and actually is becoming so.  The second, not unrelated, argument, is that the Cold War did not lead to World War III not because of nuclear weapons, but because of regular deterrence.  Both claims are fascinating; Unfortunately, I think both are wrong. <br /> <br />Start with the second one.  Mueller's argument is that while nuclear war is scarier than a non nuclear major war, a non nuclear major war is still pretty scary.  \\"A jump from a fiftieth-floor window is probably quite a bit more horrible to think about than a jump from a fifth-floor one, but anyone who finds life even minimally satisfying is extremely unlikely to do either\\" (p. 116). <br /> <br />Mueller's attempt to demonstrate his argument is via a history of the Cold War, focusing on the crisis points.  As history, it's quite good (although I recommend John Lewis Gaddis's We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History).  Mueller's point is that decision making in it were smarter and more rational then we give them credit for.  I particularly appreciate his argument that US's decision to begin the Vietnam War was well considered.  Mueller argues that the error in Vietnam was not the decision to begin it, but sticking to it after circumstances change (pp. 168-181).  I don't know enough about the Vietnam War to properly evaluate the claim, but Mueller sounds convincing.  <br /> <br />Alas, his broader theme does not.    Although none of the crises in the Cold War were worth going to a major conventional war about, let alone a nuclear one, and although most Cold War leaders were rational, that does not prove that nukes had nothing to do with keeping the parties out of war.  More  significant, perhaps, is that even with nuclear weapons, some important people (such as Mau Tse Tung and General McArthur) were not afraid of major war.  To use Mueller's vernacular, if even a jump from the fiftieth floor is seriously considered, clearly a jump from the fifth floor would not be beyond the realms of possibility.   <br /> <br />As for the first major point, Mueller compares war with social institutions that are no longer with us.  He argues that we should de mystify peace and war - war is not something essential to human nature, and peace should not be associated with \\"misty commodities\\" like \\"harmony, good will, cooperation, love, brotherhood and justice\\" (pp. 264-265).  Abolishing war, like abolishing slavery, requires no major reconstruction of the human nature or the international system.  Rather, war is becoming obsolete, because people no longer find it glorious.  The very rhetoric of warfare has changes.  Warmongers can no longer honestly proclaim, as Caesar, \\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\".  Now it's \\"I came, I saw, he attacked me while I was just standing there, I won\\". (p. 18)   <br /> <br />Mueller sees the change of attitude towards war as a major turning point.  I'm not so sure.  It seems to me that the rhetoric of warfare is always changing - the Pope no longer advocates wars on the infidels nowadays, and if he had, very few people would have listened.  But the crusades ended a long time ago, and wars haven't stopped - they just changed goals and reasons. <br /> <br />A major difference abolition of slavery and the supposed abolition of war is that when slavery was abolished, all of it was.  We did not abolish chattel slavery but maintain serfdom.  But while major wars and wars in the developed world have mostly ceased, wars in the developing world and wars between the developed world and the developing world are still very much with us. <br /> <br />Strangely, Mueller hardly refers to the best explanation to the disappearance of war in the first world - the rise of democracy.  Democratic Peace Theory is now widely acknowledged among political sciences (although there are dissenters, see [...] According to the \\"weak\\" version of Democratic Peace Theory, although democracies are as likely to fight as non democratic countries do, they do not fight other democracies.  Since most of the world's developed countries are democracies, you would not expect them to fight each other even if war was not obsolete. <br /> <br />To fight a major war in the age of massive industrial capacity and of nuclear weapons is patently mad.  Warfare will thus change, both in style and in rhetoric.  But are we rid of that \\"non-peculiar\\" institution?  Unfortunately, I think not.	2004-12-20
US	51630889	R20OS5PTG9AGAE	0299158144	928860576	The Rhetoric of Economics (Rhetoric of the Human Sciences)	Books	3	15	25	N	Y	The Deirdre is in the Details	Deirdre McCloskey hangs out with the \\"wrong\\" crowd.  She is immersed in the work of a varied group of thinkers, the likes of Paul Feyerabend, Stanley Fish and Richard Rorty - collectively often referred to as Postmodernists, although Deidre McCloskey refers to the \\"movement\\" as \\"Anti-Modernism\\" (p. 183).  The common thread that unites all these thinkers is opposition to rationality - or is it to science?  Or maybe just a skepticism about naïve-modernism?<br /><br />Because McCloskey is an economist (and a brilliant and eccentric writer), she's not prone to adopt the radicalism of Postmodernism - her take on those ideas is opposition to naïve Modernism, but without repudiating either science, rationalism or empiricism.<br /><br />Basically, McCloskey attacks Modernism, or Positivism, a simplistic view of the world according to which science is a unique channel to truth, one in which things are \\"proven\\" rather then argued, in which, if you can't count it you don't know it, where mathematics is god and a mere argument - one not backed by \\"the facts\\" - is worthless, \\"mere\\" rhetoric.  McCloskey offers \\"Ten Commandments of Modernism\\" in science (pp. 143-144), including such dictates as \\"Prediction and control is the point of science\\" (the first commandment), and \\"Only the observable implications (or predictions) of a theory matter to its truth\\" (the second commandment).<br /><br />My problem is, I doubt anyone has ever been a \\"naïve Modernist\\" in McCloskey's sense.  I only believe in two of McCloskey's commandments, and even those with misgivings.  The strongest opponents of the Postmodernists, scientists like Paul Gross and Norman Levitt, historians like Richard Evans, philosophers like Daniel Dennett - certainly are no naïve Modernists.  Even according to McCloskey herself, Milton Friedman's essay \\"The Methodology of Positive Economics\\", despite being \\"the central document of modernism in economics\\" (McCloskey's phrase), is \\"more postmodernist than you might suppose\\", and even Karl Popper is a \\"transitional figure\\"(pp. 144-145).  So what's all the fuss about?  Who is McCloskey after? When it comes to an example, McCloskey parades a research paper (by economists Richard Roll and Stephen Ross), stating:<br /><br />\\"One should not reject the conclusions derived from firm profit maximization on the basis of sample surveys in which managers claim that they trade off profits for social good\\" (quoted on p. 146)<br /><br />Is that so unreasonable?<br /><br />Compare McCloskey's three chapters against methodology and for rhetoric with chapter four of 'Intellectual Impostures' by the bete noir of Postmodernists, Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont.  Their prose and argument is more lucid; the ideas are very similar.  And as a critic of Modernist prose and scientism (and McCloskey's charge about those point is substantial), it is strange that she marshals with apparent approval the writing of someone like Stanley Fish, who writes: 'All utterances are... produced and understood within the assumption of some socially conceived and understood dimension of assessment... all facts are discourse specific... and therefore no one can claim for any language a special relationship to the facts as they \\"simple are\\".' (Quoted on p.108).<br /><br />If the central argument of McCloskey's book is not all that surprising, the book is nonetheless worth reading for McCloskey's almost incidental insights.  Her attack on the insignificance of statistical significance (chapter 8), is more developed here than in her \\"Secret Sins of Economics\\", and it is rather disturbing that so many economists have fallen into the trap of thinking that an arbitrary statistical test necessarily has real life meanings (chapter 8).  Her discussion of the justifications for the existence of a downward sloping demand curve must make anyone interested in economics think twice: \\"Some economists have tried to subject the law to a few experimental tests\\" she writes \\"After a good deal of throat-clearing they have found it to be true for clearheaded rats and false for confused humans\\" (p. 25).<br /><br />McCloskey's insight into and analysis of actual rhetoric is also fun, for example, on a classic paper by Ronald Coase:<br /><br />\\"When claiming the ethos of the Scientist the young Coase was especially fond of \\"tend to\\", the phrase becoming virtual anaphora on p. 46 (Coase 1937), repeated in all six of the complete sentences on the page and once in the footnotes. (p. 89)<br /><br />McCloskey also does some popularization of economics, almost in the matter of course.  She makes the ideas of economists comprehensible for neophytes like me; Her summery of Robert Fogel's thesis about American railroad is masterly, and she actually translates the main points of a breakthrough article by John Muth from economistic into English (pp. 54-58).<br /><br />McCloskey does all these things as after thoughts - but it's there that her genius really comes through.	2004-12-14

You may think it will be about the 1999 Kosovo war and its aftermath - I certainly did.  But you will be, as I was, mistaken.      The first one hundred pages of 'Kosovo Crossing' are a discussion of American foreign policy from Theodore Roosevelt to George Bush sr., with an emphasis about military intervention abroad.    The next 50 pages are a history of the Balkan, from Roman times and up to the end of Tito's regime, with a special focus on the Post WW1 era.  It is a topic author David Fromkin clearly knows much about, as the author of the brilliant study of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire [[ASIN:0805068848 A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East]].    But it is not the Kosovo war, nor really its near history - that would only come in the last 50 pages, and even then, the discussion is less about the Kosovo war then about the power and limitation of American Interventions.  It is telling when the line \\"Kosovo is a province of 4,200 square miles in southern Serbia, slightly smaller than the state of Connecticut\\" appears on page 158!    The two books of Fromkin I have previously read included the brilliant, carefully research and wonderfully written 'A Peace to End All Peace', an all time classic about the fall of the Ottoman Empire and its aftermath, and 'The Way of the World', a well written but unspectacular outline of human history.  Unfortunately, Kosovo Crossing is much more like the latter then the former - indeed, it does not even reach the highlights of 'The Way of the World'.    That is not, however, for the lack of clear writing.  Fromkin should serve as a model for most historians and columnists.  See his description of the rational of American Interventions:     'It was FDR, and not John Donne, who was vindicated by history.  \\"Any man's death diminishes me, for I am involvedin mankind\\", wrote the seventeenth century poet, and while it is true that sometimes another person's dying is like a bit of one's self dying, too, it isn't always like that.  Most of the times it makes good sense to ask for whom the bell tolls.' (p. 167)    The bulk of Fromkin's book is calling against humanitarian interventions.  Fromkin believes that America should intervene only when its vital interests are at risk (pp. 168-169).  Fromkin is not sanguine about the suffering of the Albanians who have gone through \\"ethnic cleansing\\", but his solution is bizarre; Fromkin argues that the US and the EU should allow the refugees to settle in them. (pp. 182-182).    There are two immediate problems with this idea:     First, it is a political impossibility;  As Peter Novick argues in [[ASIN:0618082328 The Holocaust in American Life]], political obstacles are no less real then technical ones;  No matter how high spirited or moral a President of the United States will be, accepting millions of refugees is bound to be beyond his powers.  Second, and no less important, is that this will of course only encourage ethnic cleansing - indeed, might paradoxically lead to a moral case in favor of ethnic cleansing!  Indeed, why must Palestinian refugees live in poverty in Israel, Lebanon and Jordan?  Why not send them to America?  Indiscriminate acceptance of refugees is bound to make the world more hospitable to war, massacres and ethnic cleansing.    The Palestinian example reminds us of an even more basic fallacy in Fromkin's account: Ethnic cleansing does not always solve ethnic conflicts, despite his claim that \\"If the US and NATO had not intervened, the Serbs would have settled the Kosovo issue, by ethnic cleansing.  The Kosovars would have been pushed into Albania and forcibly reunited with their own people.  Kosovo would be owned and inhibited exclusively by Serbs.  Monstrous though it would have been to let the Milosevic regime profit from its crimes, it would all be over.\\" (p. 190).  I'm afraid that I don't necessarily share Dr. Fromkin's belief in the assured success of ethnic cleansing.    As a book about American intervention in the world, Kosovo Crossing has been rendered somewhat obsolete by 9/11.  His skepticism about NATO's role in Kosovo also looks, five years down the road, at least partially overstated.  In comparison with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Kosovo looks like the very model of American interventions.    David Fromkin wrote an interesting and well written book.  At 5.99 U$, it is truly a catch.  But I do wish that Fromkin's pen will turn again to something more ambitious.	2004-12-03

Are the Supreme Court judges 'Philosopher Kings' who make law for the whole nation?  And how should the judges interpret the constitution and the laws of the United States of America? <br /> <br />In 'Desperately Seeking Certainty', Daniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry examine six Constitutional scholars (including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia), who believe they have found the answer to the last question, and thus the first two questions, as well.  The six scholars all have theories of how the U.S. constitution is to be interpreted.  Those include from Antonin Scalia and Robert Bork's Originalism - the belief that the US constitution has a specific meaning that can be recovered based on the historical record. Textual Analysis - the claim that the meaning of the constitution can be derived from its language.  Bruce Ackerman holds that the constitution has been conceptually amended three times in US History (during Foundation, Reconstruction, and the New Deal), and that the role of the court is to preserve these changes, and particularly the heritage of the New Deal.  Ronald Dworkin, philosopher as much as lawyer, holds that the Judge's role is to interpret the constitution based on the principles of liberal democracy. <br /> <br />Farber and Sherry hold that these theories are all misguided, because they elevate something that is important and useful to a supreme position.  Originalism, Textual Analysis and individual rights all have their role when Courts interprets constitutional law, but they are not exclusive.  In an ongoing joke, Farber and Sherry compare the theorist to people on a steady diet of latkes only - so much of it just isn't good for you. <br /> <br />Farber and Sherry hold that the practice of the Supreme Court is not as problematic as we may think it is;  Just because one aspect of the American System is not democratic, it doesn't mean the whole isn't.  The Supreme Court is hardly the only unelected body in the US - The Federal Reserve is equally unsupervised, and the Senate is disproportionaly representative. <br /> <br />Farber and Shelly hold that the theories are unworkable as a guide for judging, and they stand against 200 years of Supreme Court tradition.  Furthermore, there is no indication that any of these theories enjoy, now or in the past, the support of the majority of the \\"We, the People of United States\\". <br /> <br />\\"Desperately Seeking Certainty\\" in an interesting and insightful, although sometimes fairly technical, book.  It is a call for pragmatic jurisprudence and stressed the role of the judges \\"The Judges [should] be open minded, receptive to opposing views  and capable of balanced judgment... these traits of character, not adherence to a grand theory, mark the difference between a principled judge and a willful one\\" (p. 156).  We can find no refuge in grand theories of constitutional law, the authors tell us - the law, like life, is too complicated for that	2004-10-20

If Historiography is the study of the principles, theories, or methodology of historical research, then that study seems both at its infancy and at a dead end.  We know that the past happened; We can know discreet facts about it and can write compare account of it based on how well they account for the known historical facts and documents.  These statements can be clarified and elaborated, but that is, essentially, it.   <br /> <br />The real questions in history - What is important and what is marginal?  How do historians construct an account by selecting data, and how they divide the past into discreet units ('The American Revolution', 'World War II', etc), how is causation defined and explained - these, and many other questions, remain unanswered.  We can identify good history when we see it, but no matter how sophisticated and learned, historians' theories of history (other then empiricism, that is, getting the facts right) are, well, close to non existent.   <br /> <br />Starting with the late sixties, and increasingly during the eighties and the nineties, a related series of ideas started to form that did offer, in a way, a theory of history (and of the social sciences, and of human knowledge generally).  This movement, essentially a French take on Nietzsche and Heidegger's ideas, is known by many names: critics Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt, after rejecting the neo-log \\"New Rage Intellectuals\\", called the movement \\"the Academic Left\\".  In this book, Keith Windschuttle refers to it as \\"Literary critics and social theorists\\".  But the most common term is \\"Postmodernism\\". <br /> <br />   Essentially, what all brands of Postmodernism share is a deep distrust of the existence of objective knowledge about reality.  Speaking broadly, Post-modernists deny that we can know the world for certain.  Rather, the sciences and history are social constructs - the myths of Western society, called forth to serve the interests of the hegemony, and to dominate and dispossess \\"The Other\\": Women, Homosexuals, non-Western cultures, etc. <br /> <br />Like many other critics, Windschuttle is opposed to this movement, believing (in somewhat of a hyperbole, in my opinion), that it is a \\"lethal process well underway\\" (p. xii).  He argues that relying on these theories leads historians ashtray; and he offers a series of \\"road tests\\" to examine how reliable the Postmodern histories are (ibid). <br /> <br />Windschuttle does a commendable job both at describing and differentiating between the different threads that constitute Postmodernism - 'Structuralism', 'Post-Structuralism', 'Anti-humanism', 'Semiotics', etc.  His is the best account of the writings of Michel Foucault I've ever read (pp. 131-171), and he generally makes the case for his opponents better then they would themselves.  Indeed, it often seems that Windschuttle finds things of value in these works - whether it is Greg Dening's research into flogging in the British Navy (p. 73).  In a moderate and much watered down form, Windschuttle can even agree with some of the conclusions.  He reasonably accepts that culture played a \\"highly influential\\" role in the warfare of the Mexica against the Spanish, as the Postmodernist claim, but demonstrates that culture was not the primary cause of their defeat (p. 59). <br /> <br />   While Windschuttle's case studies about Postmodern history are most illuminating, he is on less even ground where he discusses theory.  In a chapter about history as a social science, Windschuttle takes us through the entire Popper/Kuhn/Feyerabend debates, in account that is not so much wrong as unfocused.  As Amazon reviews demonstrate, the most controversial aspect of Windschuttle's book is probably his attack on Karl Popper who is seen as one of the 'good guys' - that is, a strong advocate of science and no supporter of relativism.  Although I see where Windschuttle is going with his critique, I prefer more subtle accounts, such as the one offered by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont in chapter four of 'Intellectual Impostures'. <br /> <br />Windschuttle, like other critics, demonstrates that, yes, the king is naked.  Given the gross inaccuracies, defect logic, and questionable morality of Postmodernism, let alone the periodical humiliations that come when some respected vehicle of Postmodernism is exposed (Heidegger and Paul De Man's relations with Nazism, Sokal's hoax, etc), why does Postmodernism still have adherents within the academy?  How come so many educated people, who should have known better, don't?  Although many historical, political and institutional factors are involved, one answer stands out of Windschuttle's account: Postmodernism seduces with theory. <br /> <br />Paul Krugman, explaining why he is an economist, wrote: \\"Economists may make lots of bad predictions, but they do have a method - a systematic way of thinking about the world that is more true than not, that gives them genuine if imperfect expertise\\".  Other social sciences don't have such a method.  As Krugman puts it \\"other social sciences are still waiting for their Adam Smiths\\". (Paul Krugman \\"Why I am an Economist (sigh)\\" [...]) <br /> <br />At least part of the appeal of Postmodernism, I believe, is that it promises such a method - a theory that will give a systematic outlook, that will allow glimpses at the bigger picture.  But such a theory is nowhere in sight, and the fools will rush in where angels fear to thread.	2004-10-15

It occasionally moves away from the Capital, reporting events in the Eastern Front, in Chicago convention, or even in Richmond, but the focus is clearly on the politics in Washington. <br /> <br />Waugh uses the terms 'cover' and 'report' to describe what he does in this book, arguing that he treats the election of 1864 as if it was a current day election.  Indeed, the best thing about Waugh's book is that it demonstrated the messiness and doubt that affected the people at the time.  Wild schemes to replace Lincoln as President, to nominate Grant, Chase or Benjamin Butler, or to change the party tickets, were all in the air.  Waugh gives the audience a good sense of Washington's confusion in 1864 - without opinion polls, with on and off communication with the rest of the country, and with a war that seems to go good and bad unexpectedly, 1864 seemed much less certain then it does in retrospect. <br /> <br />Although Waugh's book is very readable, I would hesitate calling any book well written if it contained lines such as \\"Her beautiful head rested upon perhaps the most perfectly swanlike neck in the country\\" (p. 42).  Waugh has an irritating tendency to describe, in great detail, the physical appearance of virtually every character he introduces, never mind how minor he or she is to the account.  These descriptions slow the book down considerably - he spends the better part of three pages describing Abraham Lincoln (pp. 76-78). <br /> <br />Perhaps because Waugh is a journalist and not a historian, his approach to thequestions of historiography is somewhat nave.  Waugh says that \\"it really happened that way\\" (p. x) but of course it's more complicated then that - the problems of selection and emphasis are inherent in any account.  For example, the most important cause for Lincoln's victory in the election were the Northern military triumphs late in the summer - but Waugh dedicated only 4 pages to describe them (pp. 295-8).  When describing the relations between Lincoln and the Radicals, Waugh seems to lean against the currently accepted interpretation, which emphasizes the agreement between Lincoln and the Radicals in face of Democratic, and especially copperhead, opposition. <br /> <br />Unforgivable is the absence of maps, especially given the long account of Jubal Early's ultimately pointless raid on Washington (chapter 18).  The description of the Wilderness campaign would also have benefited from a map. <br /> <br />'Reelecting Lincoln' was the first narrative history I've read of the 1864 political situation in Washington, barring James McPherson's classic \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\".  As a narrative of those times, it gets the job done - but I can't recommend it to a more general audience <br />	2004-09-18

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	9	12	N	Y	Mr. O'Neil Goes to Washington	Of all the books, articles, TV programs and Moore's movie about the disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush, 'The Price of Loyalty', while not the most comprehensive, is certainly the most scary.   <br /> <br />Ron Suskind's account offers an interesting look into the life of Paul O'Neil, and into policy matters and Washington decision making, quite aside from George W. Bush.  Indeed, one of the interesting aspects of the book is O'Neil's friendship with Alan Greenspan.  I always imagined Greenspan as a wise and secretly sinister manipulator, but he comes off very positively in 'The Price of Loyalty', as an efficient civil servant with big ideas. <br /> <br />But the reason you're thinking about buying this book, if you haven't already, is because of George W. Bush and his role in American Politics and Policy making.  What the book tells us about the 43rd American President is quite disturbing. <br /> <br />First, I was astonished by Paul O'Neil's astonishment.  Think about it; Paul O'Neil was an insider in three Republican governments.  He was the CEO of one of America's largest corporations.  He headed various policy setting groups.  He was close friends with Alan Greenspan, Dick Cheyney, Bush Sr., and a whole other bunch of Washington insiders.  He's well trained in economics and an ardent reader of national newspaper.  And despite all this, the now familiar failing of George W Bush's leadership: his inattention to details, his wide spread ignorance, his refusal to rethink his decisions, came as a complete shock to him. <br /> <br />What does this tell us about the American public's decision to elect Bush?  If even  an insider like Paul O'Neil couldn't recognize Bush for what he was, what chance did the majority of the population have?  Did America know what it was doing when it elected Bush as President?  If Paul O'Neal didn't, how could 'six-pack Joe'? <br /> <br />'The Price of Loyalty' also made clear that high officials in the Bush administration, includingthe treasury secretary and the secretary of state, were not included in the decision about their respective fields.  All White House decisions are made by a small group of ideological cynics - Bush, Cheyney, Karl Rove, Andy Card, Karen Hugh, and maybe Condoleezza Rice. <br /> <br />The moderates in the Administration - chiefly O'Neil himself and Collin Powel - function, as O'Neil said \\"as cover\\" (p. 130) <br /> <br />It is thus deeply troubling that in the recent GOP convention, respected, conservative Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani, and moderates such as Arnold Schwarzenegger (I hesitate call him 'respected') have consented to be used as further cover for Rove and Co.  <br />The book will probably be most memorable for the direct insight on George W. Bush by an astute observant.  O'Neil's now famous comment that Bush was like \\"a blindman in a roomful of deaf people\\" (p. 149) Strikes a special chord.  O'Neil's account also explains to me why all the people who claimed that Bush was stupid could marshal no stronger evidence then his embarrassing Bushisms - the American President simply does not think in public.  Whatever analysis the President conducts is done either alone or with a company of a few chosen advisors.  One of the main insights of Suskind's book is that very few people have seen Bush think. <br /> <br />Although Suskind's book is fascinating and generally well written, it is not without its shortcomings.  At times it can be slow going or lose track of the main points; its references to Bono, for one, are all too flashing.  Occasionally, Suskind plays the mind reader - he gets pretty close to declaring what's on the President's mind (p. 185).  Nor does the book view with sufficient skepticism, in my view, O'Neil's complementary views on previous administrations.  Those all seem like models of good and sound policy making, and there is only one reference, in one page, to how badly the Nixon White House functioned late in the Watergate scandal (p. 169).<br /> <br />But the gravest problem, although perhaps an understandable one, is Suskind's lack of skepticism about O'Neil himself.  At no point does Suskind take any critics of O'Neil seriously.  This is even though, from the narrative itself, some of O'Neil's decisions seem questionable. <br /> <br />He joined on as Treasury Secretary to a President he barely knew, without a detailed discussion of the economic policies he'd favor.  He seriously misjudged Dick Cheyney, a man he's known for years.  Finally, he remained within the administration although it ignored what seems the most important points to him: fiscal prudence and rational decision making processes.   <br /> <br />What I found most shocking came in the afterword, when O'Neil, in an interview, was asked whether he'd vote for Bush again. \\"Probably\\", he said, \\"I don't see anybody that strikes me as better prepared and more capable\\".  (p. 341).  Here is loyalty for you - after all O'Neil has learned, he's still willing to cover for Bush.   <br />	2004-09-08

Although he was chiefly concerned with the shift in the balance of power from the Southern slaveholders to the Industrial North, modern historians who agree with him see emancipation and the rise of black rights as among the most revolutionary events in American History. <br /> <br />Eric Foner's work is strictly within this tradition.  Beginning with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, Foner traces the evolution of Reconstruction politics, policies and philosophy.  For Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction was a war measure, an experimental, evolving policy designed to coerce and seduce the South into surrender, and to consolidate emancipation.  Only after Appomattox, in his final speech, did Lincoln publicly endorse limited Black suffrage. <br /> <br />But for Radical Republicans, during and after the war, reconstruction was part of a grander scheme, consciously revolutionary.  The Radicals wanted to destroy the rebel Slaveholding South, and to build a new South, led by former slaves, freeborn blacks, and genuine Southern unionists.  Going as far as attempting to impeach President Andrew Johnson, whose 'Presidential Reconstruction' practically surrendered Southern states back to the rebels, Radicals undermined the Johnson based regimes, and made sweeping legislation that gave civil rights to the blacks.  The fifteenth Amendment, guaranteeing the right to votes to blacks, surrendered more ground to Nativist and anti-Feminist politics then to Anti-black sentiments (pp. 446-447). <br /> <br />The only issue upon which Congress failed to enact Radical proposals was land redistribution. The failure to give blacks ownership of the land ensured that the slaveholding classes, although weakened, still dominated Southern life, and in time they were to reestablish control over the South. <br /> <br />Eric Foner's 'Reconstruction' is, in effect, two books combined as one.  As a political history of America in the decade or so after the war, it is a masterful account, weaving together social, economic, cultural and political elements.  Although Foner is no master of prose, his writing is clear and his logic sound.  At the same time, the book is also a social history of the South during Reconstruction and Redemption. <br /> <br />Maybe I just dislike social history, but there are several chapters which could have been significantly shortened with little loss to the narrative.  Like much social history I've read, Foner rarely attempts to quantify his conclusions, and the results are often a one line description, followed by a list of illustrations.  Entirely typical are sections such as this: <br /> <br />'... Republican governors initially employed their influence to defeat civil rights bills... fearing that such measures threaten the attempt to establish their administration's legitimacy by wooing white support.  ... Governor Alcron [of Mississippi] vetoed a bill barring railroads charted by the state from discriminating against black.  In 1872, a measure imposing criminal penalties upon ... discrimination passed the legislature... but was mysteriously lost or stolen on its way to the executive mansion and thus failed to become law.  Florida Gov. Harrison Reed in 1868 vetoed a bill guaranteeing equal treatment on public conveyances, and Warmoth twice rejected civil rights measures passed by the Louisiana legislature.' (p. 370) <br /> <br />As Southern blacks were battling for their economic and political rights, the Second American Revolution increasingly raised new issues that redrew Northern and national political alliances.  The public grew agitated over Corruption, Labour relations and the choice between fiat or metal currencies.  Initially, the support for Reconstruction was the one unifying plank of all Republicans, but as Southern opposition to Reconstruction did not dwindle, the Northern enthusiasm for supporting black's rightswith the bayonet waned. <br /> <br />In 1870 and 1871, the Grant administration's crack down on the Ku Klux Klan was both effective and popular among Republicans.  But as Republicans identified themselves with other issues (chiefly monetary conservatism), Federal support for Reconstruction governments and military intervention in the South became controversial and politically damaging in the North.  By the 1876 election, Republicans were no longer committed to Reconstruction, and Redemption (the return to the old order) triumphed in the South, with the reemergence of the Jim Crow regime and the Herrenvolk democracy. <br /> <br />Although Reconstruction was not without lasting achievements, the Southern Counter-revolution undermined much of the political, economic and social advances that blacks won during the Reconstruction era.  Furthermore, the Redeemer platforms of small governments, fixed labor relations and white supremacy spelled economic stagnation for Southern whites as well as blacks (p. 597). <br /> <br />Isolated circumstances not withstanding, the movement towards equal rights for blacks, commenced in the Reconstruction era, was not really resumed until the 1930s, and was only completed, if at all, by Civil Rights movement of 1950s and 1960s.  As Foner's subtitle indicated, Reconstruction was, and arguably still is, America's Unfinished Revolution <br /> <br />	2004-09-01
US	51630889	R1ZJM4Q0T1PP02	1400040930	575332371	Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order	Books	3	7	8	N	N	The Unipolar Predicament and the Logic of Pax Americana	The crises in US-Europe relations over the Bush administration's decision to go to war in Iraq is only the latest outburst in a wider scale conflict, according to senior Carnegie Endowment for International Peace associate Robert Kagan. Ever since the first world war, and in particular since the end of the Cold War, Europe and the US has been switching their traditional roles - Europe, the land of Machtpolitik, started to believe in International Law and soft power, and the United States, whose Founding Fathers wanted to start a new world order that was based on laws and not on power, became the new advocate of realpolitiks, international relations as a question of (mostly military) power. <br />  <br /> The causes of these changes are three: first, the turn in ideology was caused by the shift in the balance of power between the United States and Europe. The United States rose and Europe declined. Second, the logic of European Unification dictates abandoning the nationalistic order and placing one's trust in international laws and institutions. Finally, with the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States as a unipolar world power has a much stronger incentive to act unilaterally, unconcerned with the need to display a common front of the &quot;free west&quot; against the &quot;totalitarian east&quot;. <br />  <br /> Probably the most controversial assessment in Robert Kagan's study is his claim that the perfect security that Europe currently enjoys is the product of the US's power politics. It was certainly true during World War 2, and probably true during the cold war, but is it true now? I think that one of the reasons for the split between European and American views of the world is that Europeans no longer feel that they benefit from US actions. <br />  <br /> In the Afterward, Kagan makes a convincing case that European's insistence of the Security Council's sanction of the Iraqi war was disingenuous - in Kosovo, Europe and the United States went to war as a 'humanitarian intervention', in complete disregard to the Security Council, were the Russians were sure to block any initiative for War. Yet chief critic of US's unilateralism, the German foreign minister Joschka Fischer, was in favor of the Kosovo invasion, even though it was not authorized by the UN. (p. 129). <br />  <br /> One can reasonably assume, with Robert Kagan, that when Europeans argue against US unilateralism, what they mean is that they want to influence its decision making. Kagan argues that the US should take Europe's desires into account - 'because American do care [about European opinion], the steady denial of international legitimacy by fellow democracies will over time become debilitating and perhaps even paralyzing' (p. 152). <br />  <br /> The United States, according to Kagan, should return to the course perused before Bush Jr.'s administration - of defining the national interest broadly, taking into account Europe's wishes. Without that, it cannot achieve the legitimacy it requires. <br />  <br /> If the US will thus enlarge its definition of national interest, there is still a &quot;rub. For even with the best of intentions, the United States cannot enlist the cooperation of Europeans if there is no common assessment of the nature of global threats today, and of the means that must be employed to meet them.&quot; (p. 156). Kagan fears that the Europe will be to concerned with US power to see the threats in the world (p. 158). <br />  <br /> But is Europe less attentive to threats in the world? The debacle about the Saddam's weapons of mass destruction is proof that the United States does not always perceive threats properly. In the 1980s, Iraq was a partner of the US (watch Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9-11 for a video of a smiling Hussein shaking hands with a youthful Dick Cheney). Even if you think the US was alert to Saddam now, it was clearly oblivious to the threat he was back then. <br />  <br /> As the bombing in Spain testifies, international terrorism is not a threat to the US alone. If there will be compelling case for use of force - like the first gulf war, Afghanistan and Kosovo - it's not unreasonable to expect Europe to approve of American Military intervention. <br />	2004-08-04
US	51630889	RC01O5SCWEO56	0679766693	665422023	The Way of the World: From the Dawn of Civilizations to the Eve of the Twenty-first Century	Books	3	32	34	N	Y	The March of Progress?	David Fromkin goes out in search of a useable past. Nor would he, I think, shy away from that description. He starts 'The Way of the World' with a description of a shaman &quot;clad in bear skin&quot; and a tale in front of the fire, telling the tribes people where they have come from and where they are heading. Fromkin's avowed purpose is to do the same for a Modern audience (p.3) <br />  <br /> Fromkin was nominated for a Pulitzer for 'A Peace to End All Peace', the story of bravery and folly at the birth of the modern Middle East. In it, he demonstrated considerable writing skills, original thought, and enormous amount of research. <br />  <br /> Only the first of these qualities is also apparent in 'The Way of the World'. The prose is even better this time around - but unfortunately, the other elements that made 'A Peace to End All Peace' into a near classic are missing. <br />  <br /> 'The Way of All World' seems to be based on fairly well known secondary sources. That's not necessary a bad thing, but you can feel that Fromkin is not as conversant about, say, Vasco da Gama's voyages, as he was about British Middle East policies in the 1920s. <br />  <br /> Lack of originality in research can also be made up for in original thinking, but although Fromkin's analysis is insightful and clever it is hardly unique. <br />  <br /> The first two parts of the book are a short history of mankind, the first chapter is about the biological evolution of homo sapiens (a well written account, drawing on such popular science books as Richard Dawkins's River Out of Eden), and the second one about pre history. Then we get two chapters on ancient civilizations, before Fromkin decides to narrow his scope and look at Western History, from the Roman Empire to the modern day. <br />  <br /> Fromkin's is a not a very original account; although it is a break with some traditional views of European history (the Reformation is mentioned in all of four pages), it is consistent with the themes of recent books about the rise of the West, such as David Landes's 'The Wealth and Poverty of Nations'. Like Landes, Fromkin sees a triumph of the West (&quot;the history of the modern world can be seen as the tale of how, out of the many civilizations that flourished in the year 1000, all but one succumbed in the course of the next thousand years&quot; p. 87) caused by a 'scientific. technological and industrial revolution' (ibid). Unlike Landes, Fromkin all but ignores the importance of politics and capitalism (mentioned only 3 times in the index) to rise of European Civilization. <br />  <br /> The third part of the book, in which Fromkin attempts to draw conclusions about the Future leaves much to be desired. Unlike Alexis do Tocqueville, whom Fromkin lionizes, Fromkin is too cautious to make predictions. He says that, at least in the beginning of the twenty first century, America will still be the most powerful country, but that is near obvious. Other predictions are equally self evident, even handed, and safe &quot;... a central question in the politics of the twenty first century throughout the world will be the tension between holding together and pulling apart: between the centripetal pull of a modern global economy that requires regional and planetary organization, and the centrifugal push of atavistic tribalism&quot; (p. 188). <br />  <br /> Some six years on, it is clear that this book was published during the Clinton years. Much in the last few chapters is a hymn to American values, in particular democracy, environmentalism, secularism and multilateralism. For a liberal such as me, the importance of these values is self evident (although it should not go unquestioned). But is George W Bush's America really the best champion of these values? <br />  <br /> Fromkin's seems oblivious to the undercurrents of American life that goes in directions opposite to the ones he champions. He discusses Woodrow Wilson's League of Nation as an embodiment of American values in International Relations. But his book is missing one crucial name: Henry Cabot Lodge, who stopped the US from entering the league of nation. <br />  <br /> As a world leader, the United States does embody values of freedom, secularism and multilateralism. But it also has values which are unilateral, imperialistic, protectionist and isolationist. A safe prediction is that the world will be shaped significantly by the US decision of which of these sets of values, or which combination thereof, it will pursue in the 21st century.  <br />	2004-07-26

He lost two Senatorial elections - but in 1861, he was elected as the first Republican president of the United States of America.<br /><br /> The main thrust of &quot;Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850s&quot; is the attempt to explain how that happened. This is not a biography - rather, it is a collection of interconnected essays exploring, among other things, the importance of Lincoln's Illinois background, his transformation from Whig to Republican, the House Divided speech, and above all, the contest between Lincoln and the most important politician of the 1850s, Stephen A. Douglas.<br /><br /> The late Don E. Fehrenbacher was one of the best scholars of American Law & Politics in the 19th century, and of its relations with slavery. He is best known for his study of the Pulitzer winning account of the Dred Scot Case, but has also written books about the Secession Crises in the United States and about the relations of the US Government to Slavery.<br /><br /> Those who have read Professor Fehrenbacher before will reencounter not only his masterful prose and careful analysis, but many themes that he has written about elsewhere - Slavery in the territories, the &quot;Freeport doctrine&quot;, the Dred Scot Case, etc. But the greatness of Fehrenbacher was his ability to offer every time a new insight into these issues, widening and deepening your understanding of it.<br /><br /> This time, the focus is on the interplay between the ambitions and ideals of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A Douglas. We see the famous &quot;House Divided&quot; speech as Lincoln's attempt to distinguish between the Anti-Lecompton Douglas (the Lecompton constitution was a fraudulent pro slavery creation, which Stephen Douglas opposed because he felt it violated the principle of popular sovereignty) and the Republicans: Republicans saw slavery as evil, whereas Douglas treated it with indifference.<br /><br /> Fehrenbacher maintains that the 'House Divided' speech was less revolutionary then it sometimes appears. &quot;The bright promise of ultimate extinction [of slavery] was one of the consequences expected to flow naturally from a settled policy of restrict[ing the expansion of slavery]&quot; (p. 76). So Southerners could supposedly be satisfied that, beyond restricting its extension, no further steps against slavery were intended. Yet, as Fehrenbacher points out, Lincoln believed in a national policy against slavery, treating it as an evil (p. 148). For Southerners, who saw Slavery as a matter of the States, and who have come to appreciate it as a positive good, that was unacceptable.<br /><br /> Yet, at least with the benefit of hindsight, The South promoted the worst policy possible, if the defense of the &quot;Peculiar Institution&quot; was what it was after. By their insistence of the repeal of the Missouri compromise (forbidding slavery in the part of the Missouri territory north of the Mason Dixon line), a harsh fugitive trade law, and accepting the fraudulent Lecompton constitution, Southerners agitated the Northern public about the slavery issue, thus strengthening the Republican Party.<br /><br /> When Stephen Douglas, courting his Northern audience, adopted increasingly anti-Slavery positions (interestingly, Fehrenbacher here sees Douglas's position as entirely opportunistic. Later, in 'The Dred Scot Case' he saw Douglas's motives as a mix of calculation and principle, see Fehrenbacher, Dred Scot Case p. 465), the South's alienation from Douglas made it even more extreme - thus, the &quot;Freeport doctrine&quot;, which said that the people of a territory had the ability to reject slavery by unfriendly legislation (essentially, the observation that unpopular laws are difficult to enforce), initially acceptable to the South, became anathema once it was identified with Douglas.<br /><br /> Lincoln's rise had muchto do with Stephen Douglas. Without the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, he probably wouldn't have become president, at least not in 1860. But Lincoln's triumph in the Republican convention in Chicago was based on his apparent moderation - the leading candidate William H. Seward, was far too anti-Slavery; and his public opposition to nativism was also objectionable.<br /><br /> Lincoln was elected because he was a compromise candidate - his public profile of moderation, essential for winning over the lower Northern states, and being a representative of Illinois, one of the crucial states in the election. But he also won because of his careful political maneuvering.

Beyond such generalities such as \\"what is the nature of truth?\\", historians have to decide which facts are relevant to the case they are studying, what are causes in history, and how to make a narrative, a book or a mathematical model, that will capture something significant of the world.       All of these are interesting questions, but except peripherally, David Hackett Fischer doesn't discuss them. Rather, Fischer tries to track down specific fallacies that historians commit, and spell them out, apparently in order to help other scholars avoid them.      \\"Historians' Fallacies\\" is basically a collection and a catalogue of errors, some well known ones, such as \\"the fallacy of post hoc, propter hoc\\" (following, therefore caused by, p. 166) or \\"the pathetic fallacy\\" (ascribing animate behavior to inanimate objects, pp. 190-193) and some as obscure as \\"the fallacy of indiscriminate pluralism\\" (enumerating multiple causes without discrimination, pp. 175-177).      There are at least three commendable aspects to Fischer's study. First, Fischer is a fine writer, with remarkable turns of phrases: \\"Sir Lewis [Namier] was no enemy of chosenness in either facts or people. He was, indeed, a committed Zionist in both respects.\\" (p. 69).     Another is Fischer's willingness to name names. Too many critics prefer uses such as \\"many writers\\", etc, but although Fischer does occasionally shies away (such as in his discussion of ad hominem attacks pp.290-293), he's generally willing to openly criticize some leading historians and intellectuals. Nor does Fischer satisfy himself with attacking such usual suspects as Robert Fogel, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Arnold Toynbee; Everyone who has any interest at all in American intellectual history of the 20th century will find at least some of his or hers heroes under fire. Historians from Charles Beard to E.P. Thompson, from economist Kenneth Boulding (who was the mentor of one of my college professors) to Henry Kissinger. My favorite is the critique of Southern historian C. Vann Woodward:     \\"Through two revisions, the author has held his ground with a tenacity worthy of a better cause. The result is another fallacy - the overwhelming exception. We are now told that the interpretation applies to all Southern institutions except churches, schools, militia, hotels, restaurants, public buildings, jails, hospitals, asylums, gardens, and the New Orleans Opera House\\" (p. 149 n).     A third highpoint of the book is that it sometimes hits the bull's eye. Under \\"the fallacy of semantical questions\\", Fischer criticizes historians who focus on labels instead of content such as the 'prolonged dispute among American colonial historians over the question \\"Was the political structure of seventeenth-century America 'democratic' or 'Aristocratic'?\\"' (p.22). If you've never read studies who committed the same offence, you will not recognize the immense desire to strangle a historian who does.     But in the attempt to describe the errors of Historians, Fischer falls to the same trap that my Business courses in college fell into - they tried to make laws and regularities of something that if far too context dependant for that. So almost all the time, what you've got is specific instances of erring historians, with fallacies which say something like \\"don't exaggerate\\", \\"do careful research\\" and \\"use sound judgment\\".     When it comes to generalize, to give positive insight as how to go on a historian's business, Fischer's advice is invariably trivial, true-but-obvious. \\"Motives are usually pluralistic in both their number and their nature. Abraham Maslow writes, 'typically an act has more than one motive'. To this, one might add that it has motives of more than one kind.\\" Oh really? (p. 214)     Maybe some of my criticism of Fischer's book is (as he might have said) anachronistic. Fischer objects to unnecessary jargon: \\"Ordinary everyday words like \\"simple\\" are replaced by monstrosities such as \\"simplistic\\" without any refinement of meaning\\" (p.285). Today, I doubt anyone would write about a simple solution while meaning a simplistic one, but maybe in the 1960s the distinction was not as clear.     Within the point by point critiques of Historians' errors, there seems to be an overarching thesis that remains implicit, but that guides Fischer's thought process: the inevitability of history, or the assumption that events are caused by the forces of history, rather then the actions of individuals.      Fischer calls the \\"fallacy of responsibility as cause\\", confusing the problem of agency with that of ethics (pp.182-183). If I understand him correctly, he seems to argue that individual leaders are not responsible to wide scale events: \\"The cause of the failure of Reconstruction race policy muse surely be sought in general phenomena for which no free and responsible human agent can be held to blame\\" (Ibid.). Is Fischer really saying that there was nothing that, say, Andrew Johnson or Grant could've done better? Or that it wouldn't have mattered? If he does, then he robs human beings of their abilities to change the future. That's a highly controversial (and clearly metaphysical) position, and one that clashes with his call for using history as a way to teach people rationality (pp. 316-318).    Despite its frequent wit and occasional insights, Fischer's book does not quite illuminate a path for other historians to follow. I don't think we're any closer to a logic of historical thought than we were before.	2004-07-22

In [[ASIN:0618082328 The Holocaust in American Life]], he dealt with the changing perception of the Holocaust in (mostly) Jewish America.  [[ASIN:0521357454 That Noble Dream: The 'Objectivity Question' and the American Historical Profession (Ideas in Context)]] is even better, a wide scale study of American Intellectual life from the late 1800s to the mid 1980s, focus on its evolving perception of truth and objectivity, and questioning the ability of historians to tell it, as Ranke ordered \\"wie es eigenlisch gewesen\\" - as it actually (or essentially), was.    I was delighted for having managed to put my hands on a copy of Novick's earlier and lesser known study, \\"The Resistance versus Vichy\\", based on his doctoral dissertation, studying the war the Resistance has waged on the Vichy collaborators.    Unfortunately, although the topic is fascinating, Novick treatment falls short of the very high standard I've come to expect from him.  There are times when one can get a glimpse of the master's voice in this narrative, especially during a narration of the struggle between Generals de Gaulle and Giraud, or the trials of Marshall Petain and his henchman Leval.  But more often, Novick's book is unfocused, and the proverbial trees obscure the forest.    Novick's book is about how the purges were hampered by the various technical obstacles, political realities, and different outlooks of the various political parties (The Communists, Gaullists, Conservatives, etc).  The Purge was part of the dream to create a New France, \\"pure et dure\\", and its failure caused much early disappointment and disillusion from the fourth republic.  \\"The failure of the purge to satisfy either of these groups - or indeed, to satisfy anyone, was inevitable\\" Novick writes.  \\"[the leaders of the Provisional Government acted] as honestly, as conscientiously, and as well as any group of men could in the circumstances.\\" (p. 189).    The purge had many forms - from mob lynches to minuet cleansing in the police and the armed forces, prosecutions of informants and Vichy ministers, and a court which forbade or suspended participation in public life.  The purge affected every walk of life - but whether it was too hard or too lenient depended on where you stood.  Either way, the punishments varied considerably from case to case, with little consistency, and the laws under which the collaborated were persecuted were retroactive.  Very few people, either Vichyites or resistants, were satisfied at the end of it.    Novick's research is considerable, and his judgment is, I believe, sound.  But his presentation is flawed.  Trapped within the minuet details of obscure beauracratic organizations and petty politicians is a story of a land that was torn apart, of a rebirth that was partially aborted at the very beginning.  Unfortunately, \\"The Resistance vs. Vichy\\" does not quite tell that story.	2004-07-10

(...).  If you wish to write a bad biography, the guide:<br />* Base your work on the officially published and easily reached autobiographies by the subject.  Besides a few obvious interviews and a couple of web sites, look no further.  Make no attempt to uncover the things the writer of the autobiography tried to hide.<br />* Don't bother with even the most rudimentary of fact checking, so that your work will contain many egregious mistakes.  My personal favorites:  according to Karen Judson, Asimov made more money writing non fiction than fiction (p. 53), and 'Golden Age' SF was character driven (p.50).  Both of these claims are not just false: they're absurd.  Asimov wrote more non fiction then fiction because he enjoyed it more, even though he made much less money writing it.  The main feature of Golden Age SF was a focus on scientific literacy.  SF before the golden age was relatively scientifically inaccurate, and the Golden Age contained many working scientists who wrote more vigorously about science.<br />* Do not look into any of the dark corners of your subject's past.  Although Isaac Asimov lived a comfortable bourgeois existence, there are several controversies worth looking into: his conflicts with his superiors in Boston University, his infidelities, his atheism, and the way he treated his eldest son, David.  In his writing career, later Asimov seemed to have sold his soul to the industry, allowing his name to be put on dozens of titles on which he did practically zero work (Stuff like: Isaac Asimov presents Superquizs) We now know that Asimov died of AIDS he received from a blood transfer in the early 1980s - all of these deserve discussion, but are hardly even mentioned.<br />* Spend inordinary amount of time on issues of no importance.  The author spends the better part of two pages discussion Isaac's World - a largely forgotten sharedworld anthology in the late 80s, now defunct and forgotten.   She spends no less then three pages making dull summaries of books by other authors, who have very little in common besides being influential books on the developing SF scene in the 1930s.  It seems like no thought was given as to what is essential and what is peripheral in Asimov's life.<br />Despite being a homebody who lived very ordinary life, Asimov was a fascinating character, brilliant, witty, arrogant and eccentric.  As a writer, Asimov revolutionized Science Fiction, and his work has influenced thousands around the world.  As a Jewish Liberal and the son of an émigré, Asimov is a representative of a class that had a disproportionate influence on American Life in the 20th century.  But you won't know it from reading this book.<br />If you're interested in Isaac Asimov, I recommend reading his memoir, I, Asimov.  It is deeper, more reflective, better written, and much, much more interesting.	2004-06-23
US	51630889	R28RV0MC70SQW6	038550313X	174875218	Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic	Books	4	127	135	N	N	The Decline and Fall of the Roman Republic	It is easier to pin point the ending of Tom Holland's book then its beginning - it ends with the death of Augustus in 14 AD, years after the Roman Republic has ceased to exist in anything but its name.    The beginning of Holland's book, like the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic, is harder to spot.  Does it start with the fall of Carthage?  With the murder of reformer tribunes Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus?  Or with the first clashes between Marius and Sulla?  Holland tells it all, in a spellbinding narrative that is hard to put down.    In just under four hundred pages, we get a short overview of the early republic, and then a focused narrative its final century.  This is the story of some of history's greatest men and women, from Sulla to Cato, Pompey and Cicero and Cleopatra, and of course, Julius Caesar.  It is a tale of murders and political maneuvering, honor and greed and lust.  And, complicated as it all is, Holland serves as a fine guide through the intricate web of the dying republic.    I think it's the power of the prose, above anything, that makes Holland's book so fascinating.  It reads like a novel, probably the best written account of the Roman World I've read since Robert Graves's I, Claudius.  At times, he may use anachronistic terms for the narrative ('location, location, location', or 'Mutually Assured Destruction') - but that's a misdemeanor that is easily forgivable, and some may find it charming.    In the blow by blow account of the political struggles, it is sometimes hard to see a larger scheme or thesis.  In as far as there is one, it is probably that the decline of the Roman Republic came through the rise of the Roman Empire.  As the Romans expanded, out of Italy and into the entire Hellenistic world and beyond, its generals became increasingly rich and powerful.  The armies they have raised stopped being faithful to the Republic, and shifted their loyalties to their leaders.  The republic became an arena for a small number of powerful men, reducing the rest of the aristocracy to the role of near-spectators, when the best they could do was pick sides.    In the introduction, Holland says that most events in the History are amenable to different interpretation, but in the text itself, there are precious few references to such instances.  Holland, I think, generalizes much too much about the way 'Romans' in abstract thought, felt, or acted.  His footnotes, referring exclusively to ancient sources (although his bibliography does contain much modern work) is virtually useless for anyone unless they're willing to dig into the primary sources.    But at the end, that's just not that kind of a book.  Holland weaves a breathtaking tapestry of characters, events, and touches of mysticism.  Any flaws in the historiography are overshadowed by the triumph of storytelling.	2004-06-17
US	51630889	R2MMBPQZMOWEXF	0525948139	537228107	The President of Good and Evil: The Ethics of George W. Bush	Books	4	19	30	N	N	Misspelling 'Inconsistent': Bush Jr.'s Rhetoric &amp; Practice	Peter Singer is a world renowned philosopher and ethicist.  George W. Bush is, well? err.<br />Let's start over.  In 'The President of Good and Evil: Taking George W. Bush seriously', Peter Singer makes a thorough examination of George W. Bush's ethics.  As Singer observes: &quot;No other president in living memory has spoken so often about good and evil, right and wrong&quot; (p.1).  Singer examines Bush's moral philosophy, and the gaps between what Bush preaches and what he does.<br />The results of Peter Singer's study are not very encouraging.  Bush is inconsistent about virtually everything.  Does he believe that life is sacred?  He says he does, but then he's willing to sacrifice thousands of innocent Afghans and Iraqis in his quest to rid the world of evil (p.50).  Fine, then is George W Bush, despite what he says, a Utilitarian, that is, holding the view that the right action is that which is expected to the best consequence for all those affected by one's action now and in the future?  Well, that does not square with his position against stem cell research.  Stem well research can save lives, but Bush apparently values the life of unborn, sure-to-be-discarded embryos over the life of the many people who can benefit from the cure.  Apparently, sometimes life is sacred and sometimes it isn't.<br />It goes on ? does Bush believe in free trade?  He says that the case for trade is &quot;not just monetary, but moral. Economic freedom creates habits of liberty&quot; (quoted on p. 126).  But how can the imposition of a 30% tariff on steel imports be &quot;work[ing] to end tariffs and break down barriers everywhere&quot;(pp. 128-129)? <br />Similar inconsistencies abound as to State's rights (they have the right to put up the confederate flag, but not the right to use Marijuana for medical purposes, nor the right to decide for themselves about physician assisted suicide), Freedom (the US is the &quot;freest nation in the world&quot;, but if Bush thinks you might bea terrorist you can be held for as long as he fancies without a trial, without the right to see a lawyer, and possibly be tortured), and lying (which is wrong, but not when you're knowingly misleading your countrymen about Saddam Hussein's attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction in Africa pp. 212-216).<br />Perhaps the grossest inconsistency is in Bush's justification for engaging in Pre-emptive war.  Who gets to determine whether a threat is serious enough to warrant a pre-emptive strike?  Given the US possession of Nuclear weapons, its current policy of pre-emption, and Bush's verbal threats to North Korea, would North Korea be justified in launching a pre-emptive strike on the US?  Singer notes:<br /> &quot;one might say, as Bush himself has often said, that the United States is a 'peace- loving nation', and it is peace-loving nations that can be justified in waging a preemptive war&quot; (p. 183) <br />The weakest parts of Singer's critique come in two parallel issues ? the domestic rights and obligations of the state and the international rights and obligations of the United Nations.  Singer is correct that the UN, and not the US, has the greater moral authority to decide questions of international war and peace, and that the state, and not the individual members in the society, has the obligation to promote equality and fight poverty.  But in both cases, Singer ignores or underplays the main conservative argument ? that states are inefficient in dealing with poverty through reallocation and resources, and that international bodies are inefficient in diffusing international crises.  You don't have to agree with these positions (I have serious misgiving about them myself), but if they are true, they make a good case for small governments at home and unilateral action abroad.<br />Most of Singer's critique, although it hits the mark, is hardly new.  There are countless books which make all or most of these points, and some others.  Sources as wide apart as The Economist and The New York Review of Books have criticized Bush's politics, economics, and (although usually implicitly) morals.<br />I think Singer is somewhat unfair in criticizing Bush's ethics and scrutinizing his speeches in quest for a &quot;coherent moral philosophy&quot; (p.2).  Along with Professor Singer's cynical friends and colleagues, I think Bush is a politician whose business is to get reelected, not to teach or demonstrate ethics.  Singer writes that &quot;tens of millions of Americans? share the views [Bush] puts forward on a wide range of moral issues?.  Those who think I am na?ve Bush's view may therefore see [the book] as an examination or critique of a set of beliefs widely shared by the American public.&quot; (pp.5-6). Surely there is a better champion of these views then the American President?  Attacking some of the leading right wing conservatives may be less commercially successful, but fairer to these views.	2004-06-08

While most people would probably identify the American Revolution with the American War of Independence, Gordon S. Wood sees it as something more: a complete change in the ideological and political structure of British America, from the Royal colonies of 1763 to the Unites States of 1787.  Within a single generation, America twice revised its views about the government and sovereignty.  <br />Wood does not disregard the material causes for independence, the interest groups and the petty local politics that fed fuel to the conflict between the colonies and the mother country, but his focus is on the ideological and philosophical issues - the British, who saw Parliament as the source of authority to all of the British Empire, whether the constituents voted for the MPs or not, and the Americans, who held to the principle of &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;, and the ideology that contrasted liberty and self rule with the tyrannical power of the divine rights of kings.<br />With the deepening, crisis, the Colonists, although willing in principle to acknowledge that Parliament had the right to regulate external commerce and navigation laws &quot;from the necessities of the case, and a regard to the mutual interests of both countries&quot; (p.44), could no longer reconcile that view with the British all-or-nothing perspective, in which sovereignty lay within Parliament and Parliament alone.  The widespread violence and King George III's declaration that the colonies were in open revolt helped push the Americans into declaring their independence.<br />Under the Articles of Confederation, the Founding Fathers of the United States formed an alternative form of government to the Imperial system - no longer a centre and a periphery, but a collective of equal, cooperating states.  With the Northwest Ordinance, the Americans acknowledged the Western settlers as the equals of the thirteen original colonies.  Proportionally representative legislative councils were seen as the instrument of government, the protection against executive tyranny.<br />The failure of the all-powerful legislatives to adequately answer the needs of the public good, and the lack of cooperation between the states, led to another change in the American political philosophy.  Local legislative councils changed from being the ultimate expression of Public sovereignty, to one element in a complex national system, meant to keep checks and balances between the states and the Federal Union, and between the branches of government. The ultimate purpose was to keep sovereignty in the hands of &quot;we, the people of the United States of America&quot;<br />There is far more in Wood's book then I can do justice to in a short review.  But Wood's detailed investigation of the political and ideological aspects of the revolution means that much remains neglected.  The social changes of America are hardly more then alluded to, and the economic changes are never coherently explained.  The worst neglect, though, is the Military history aspects of the Revolution - the American War of Independence is dealt with almost entirely in about 6 pages.  Nor are the major personalities of the Revolution given due attention: Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Henry and Washington are mentioned but only in the context of their ideas or public actions.  There is only a single exception - Wood's short discussion of Washington's choice to re-enter political life and participate in the 1787 Philadelphia Convention.<br />In the past couple of years, I've tried to read three different accounts of the American Revolution, and have been unable to finish any of them.  Gordon S. Wood's short book is a fascinating read and a good introduction to the Revolution and to the changes it brought on America.	2004-05-16

And if they are, what are their sins?  In this tiny booklet (at 58 pages of text, this must be one of the worst ratios of words per cents available on Amazon), Dierdre McCloskey argues that they are, but that their sins are not what most humanistic critiques think.<br />I've recently praised a Paul Krugman book as the best written book about economics I've read - I already rue my words, because it hasn't been three months yet, and Professor McCloskey, an artist of prose, surpasses him.  Even if you disagree with everything McCloskey says, reading this book is a delight.  When satirizing quantification in economics (which she approves, by the way):<br />&quot;And the economists, oh, the economists, how they counted, and still count.  Take any copy of The American Economic Review (Surely you subscribe?) and open it at random.  To perhaps Joel Waldfogel, &quot;The Deadweight Loss of Christmas&quot; (No Kidding: December 1993; Waldfogel is arguing that since a gift is not chosen by the recipient it is not worth what the giver spent, which leads o a loss compared with merely sending cash.  Who could not love such a science of Prudence?)&quot; (p.6)<br />You could be mistaken into thinking that McCloskey is against quantification, statistics or mathematics, but she merely cannot resist some highly amusing cheap shots.  McCloskey is in favor of Quantification, use of mathematic models, and of the libertarian bias of economists (not very convincingly in the case of the latter, in my opinion).<br />There are some other, minor sins which are not really the target of McCloskey, but to which she devotes a great deal of her time.  So by the time we get to &quot;The Two Real Sins, Almost Peculiar to Economics&quot; it is already page 37.  Time's almost up, and the sins are two:<br />First, McCloskey believes that the theorizing economists do in their theoretical work is really no theorizing - the theories include no place for quantifications, and so remain abstract &quot;If A then B&quot; may be entirely consist in and of itself - but it may be entirely wrong, if A is not true.  If the theories are not open to quantification, they can hardly be falsified, nor can we estimate whether their effect is considerable or marginal.<br />The other sin of economics is the alleged reliance of economists on &quot;statistical significance&quot;.  A high statistical significance assures us that the result we get is not noise at say 5%, 1% or 0.1% levels, meaning that there's only 1-in-twenty, 1-in-a-hundred, or 1-in-a-thousand chance that the result one gets is accidental.  McCloskey's point is that even if a theory fails the 5% level, for example, it does not mean that the theory isn't true (it just means that you're not 95% sure it is true).  That point goes the other way around, too - if you measure enough things, you're going to find some which will seem to be correlated even though they clearly aren't - &quot;For a long time in Britain the number of ham radio operator licenses granted annually was very highly correlated with the number of people certified insane.  Very funny.  So?&quot; (p. 53).<br />I admit that I lack familiarity with current economic research to comment on how close McCloskey's criticism hits the mark.  In the last page of &quot;The Secret Sins of Economics&quot; Deirdre McCloskey compares herself to Cassandra, the prophetess from Troy, whose advice was ignored by the Trojans as they brought the famous horse into their city.  Amusing, yet economics is a science, not a grand retelling of an old myth, and McCloskey is not cursed by Apollo.  At least some of the guilty, 'Samuelsonian' economists must have responded to McCloskey's critiques, but if you want to hear those answers, you will have to look elsewhere.	2004-05-14
US	51630889	R3CEBYA0G717Z0	0231104839	494333380	Israel and the Bomb	Books	4	34	34	N	N	The Strange World of Nuclear Politics	A (long) waiting for the latest shipment of books from Amazon has an upside - I'm left to read books purchased in Israeli bookstores, often in Hebrew, and obviously, often about Israel or Israeli politics.<br />Avner Cohen's &quot;Israel and the Bomb&quot; is such a book, and, despite some structural flaws it is a well written one.  The main focus is not really Israel's Weapons of Mass Destruction, but Israel's nuclear policies, particularly vis a vis the United States.  This is the story of Israel's responds to US pressure with two similar but distinct strategies, which Cohen designates &quot;Ambiguity&quot; and &quot;Opacity&quot;.  <br />In late 1960, the US government came to realize that Israel was constructing in Dimona a large scale nuclear reactor.  The uncovering of that Israeli state secret led to various Israeli announcements that Israel had no intention of building Nuclear WMDs.  On the 21st of December, 3 days after a New York Times front page story about Israel's Reactor in Dimona, David Ben Gurion made what is still the only Prime Ministerial speech in the Knesset (Israel's parliament) about its Nuclear Policies, stating that the Reactor is meant for peaceful uses only (p.128).<br />The Eisenhower administration seemed initially unwilling to pressure Israel about its nuclear facilities, but following the exposure it did demand answers about Israel's plans.  In a meeting with US Ambassador Ogden R Reid, David Ben Gurion stated that the Plutonium from the reactor will be returned to the manufacturing country, that Israel will allow visits of scientists from friendly countries in the reactor, but not international inspections, and that Israel did not plan to construct a third nuclear reactor.  He also denied any intentions to construct a nuclear bomb (pp. 130-133).<br />When John F. Kennedy became the 35th president of the United States, US policy became hostile to Nuclear Proliferation, and Kennedy started a drive that ended in the 1968 Non Proliferation Treaty.  Therefore, his policies towards Israel were meant to assure that Israel was not constructing Nuclear weapons.  Since Israel was doing just that, the clashes were all but inevitable.<br />US Scientists started to inspect (the US's term; Israel preferred &quot;visit&quot;) Dimona in 1961.  Despite the US demand for 2 such visits per year, Israel's duck-and-weave policy never allowed more then one single day visit per year.  <br />The US continued to pressure Israel, especially towards the end of Kennedy's administration.  In April of 1963, Kennedy arranged an unplanned meeting with Shimon Peres, the architect of Israel's reactor in Dimona and then the deputy minister for defense, in which Peres first articulated (apparently spontaneously) Israel's formula about Nuclear weapons &quot;Israel will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the middle east&quot;  (p. 159).  Towards the end of Ben Gurion's prime ministry, and Kennedy's presidency, the ground rules for the &quot;ambiguity&quot; policy of Israel were set: Israel stated that it had no intentions to construct nuclear weapons, and it allowed US visitors, albeit in a lesser frequency then the US desired.  Ben Gurion's resignation and the assassination of Kennedy meant that their predecessors would have to continue, and refine, &quot;ambiguity&quot; as Israel's policy and US's response.<br />The main change in subsequent US-Israeli relationship was Israel's increased interest in purchasing conventional weapons from the US.  Strangely, Israel and the US switched roles in these two dialogues.  Regarding Nuclear weapons, the US kept pressuring Israel to allow more inspections, and to authorize the US to share its belief in Israel's peaceful intentions, while Israel evaded.  In the weapons front, Israel kept asking to buy weapons, while the US tried to evade and delay.  Neither side wanted to connect the subjects, because Israel was anxious not to disclose its intentions, while the US fearedthat pressuring Israel by withholding conventional weaponry would only further commit it to the nuclear option (p. 272).  Unlike the Kennedy administration, Lyndon Johnson seems to have been willing to accept Israel's nuclear plans, as long as they were not public.  Thus &quot;ambiguity&quot; started to give over to &quot;opacity&quot; (p. 276).<br />Chiefly, &quot;Opacity&quot; meant the acknowledgement of Israel as a de-facto Nuclear power, provided that Israel made few outspoken references to its nuclear capacities.  Late in the Johnson administration, the President was unwilling to tie the sale of Phantom jets to Israel to Israel's signing the Non-Proliferation Treatment.  Israel's then ambassador to the US, Yitzhak Rabin, defined Israel agreement not to &quot;introduce&quot; nuclear weapons to the Middle East as an agreement not to test it (p. 409).  By then Israel clearly possessed nuclear weapons.  Under Nixon, the US effectively gave up contesting that definition, and gave up the increasingly embarrassing inspections of the Dimona reactor.  On the 18th of July, 1970, the New York Times announced that Israel was a nuclear power, and although both Israel's official spokespersons and the State Department denounced the article as &quot;speculative&quot; and &quot;inaccurate&quot;, neither denied it (p. 434).<br />Avner Cohen's book tells the story of the creation of the Israeli bomb, and the relations between Israel and the US is just one part of this story.  Yet it was the Israeli-American relationship that above all defined Israel's continued policy of Opacity, still intact almost 35 years after that New York Times news story.  In the afterwards, Cohen calls for a reconsideration of Israel's nuclear policy, and is encouraged by the new openness of public discourse about it.  Yet even if Israel's policy was chiefly designed in response to US pressure, the bomb was build because of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  In that conflict, it often seems that the more thingschange, the more they stay the same.	2004-05-07
US	51630889	R30KYHK2YPYME7	047146502X	312680518	The Case for Israel	Books	3	41	64	N	N	Biased, but inherently sound	Alan Dershowitz wrote a defense on Israel which, like any good advocate's, makes his clients position seem somewhat better then it really is.  But while, acting as a jury, one should notice the problems that Dershowitz fails to point out, the heart of Deshowitz's argument is sound: Israel is frequently unfairly singled out for attack, and some of the most prominent critics of Israel make bogus or exaggerated claims.<br />Professor Dershowitz makes his case easier for him by defending Israel from a position supportive of the two-state solution.  Dershowitz is of course correct that the only hope for a reasonable outcome in the Middle East is both parties acceptance of that solution, and rejection of other utopian or dystopian ideas.  Although the majority of Israelis almost certainly support, at least in theory, the two-state solution, there is a significant minority which objects to it vehemently. <br />One of the fallacies that many of Israel's critics, and sometimes its defenders fall for is to see Israel as a monolith.  Much of Deshowitz's case is not for Israel but for the two-state solution, and for the Israelis who support it.  Thus, to the extent that former PM's Yitzhak Shamir's position, for example, represents Israel, Dershowitz defense of Israel does not apply.  Perhaps a better title for the book, although not a very catchy one, would have been \\"The Two State Solutions, the (Israelis) who support it, and the (Palestinians) who don't\\".<br />In 32 chapters, Dershowitz attacks arguments which make Israel seem like the aggressor in the Middle East.  Sometimes the questions Dershowitz doesn't ask are as significant as the ones he does.  He asks, for example, whether Israel was responsible for the 1967 Six Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War (is wasn't), but not whether Israel was responsible for the 1982 Lebanon War (it was). <br />Furthermore, Dershowitz spends only two pages on the question of whether the settlements have been a major obstacle to peace.  Although Dershowitz is correct in pointing out that settlements can and have been evacuated, he fails to mention the effect of the settlements, usually populated with the most extreme right winger Israelis, heavily defended by the IDF, on the Arabs in whose neighborhoods they are placed.  The settlements supported either explicitly or implicitly by every Israeli government since Rabin's first prime-ministry in 1974 and up to today's Sharon's government, are a source of constant tension which makes Palestinians hate and resent Israelis.<br />Dershowitz denies that Jews took advantage of the Holocaust for political gains (ch. 7), even though the Jewish discourse about the Arab-Israeli conflict is, naturally enough, filled with reference to the Holocaust from both left and right (as Peter Novick might have said 'To Each His Own Holocaust').  Dershowitz also elaborates on the connection between Arabs, and especially the Jerusalem Mufti Al Husseini, and Nazism.  I think he overstates the connection, which was natural at the time.  Arabs and Nazis had two common enemies: the British and the Jews.  Stranger bedfellows existed - Dershowitz fails to mention that Zionists and Nazis cooperated when their ends corresponded, in promoting Jewish immigration to Israel in the early 1930s.<br />Yet although Dershowitz overstates his case, and overlooks arguments which make Israel look bad, the main claims of his thesis stand:<br />First, various Israeli governments and leaders, from Haim Weitzman in the 1910s to Ehud Barak in 2000, has offered Arabs to partition Israel, and several generations of Arab and Palestinian leaders have opposed.  Arafat's refusal to accept Barak's offer in Camp David in 2000, or to give a counter proposal, was a tragic mistake of judgment, and Arafat, Clausewitz's best (indeed only) disciple in the middle east, compounded the error by launching the El Aqsa Intifada - a failed continuation of a bad policy by different means.<br />Second, for reasons which have not yet been sufficiently explained, Israel receives extensive and unfair criticism far beyond virtually any other country.  Israel's actions, although often failing the moral ideal, are far better then actions by other countries, given the extent of the attacks on it.  Nothing Israel did is anywhere as bad as the US's actions in Japan, Germany, Vietnam or Iraq; as French actions in Algiers or Belgian action in the Congo, or as Russian actions in Chechnya -let alone the behavior of so many Arab regimes which are quick to condemn Israel.<br />Israel, like any other nation, requires criticism when its specific policies are wrong or dangerous.  But extreme criticism, which challenges Israel's right to exist and signals it out to condemnation among the nations, is not only wrong, it is ineffective.  The best of Israel's critics are the ones who recognize its right to exist, and who make specific recommendations to help Israelis and Arabs co-operate.  Israelis obviously rarely pay close attention to far off the mark critiques which liken it to Nazi Germany, and to the extent that Arabs do, it drives them away from moderation and into fanatic hate.  Such criticism, thus, is worse then a crime - it is a blunder.	2004-04-30

As I'm more interested in political and intellectual history than military history, I probably do not appreciate this book as its target audience, presumably military history aficionados, do. For me this is a double introduction: this is the first of Ospery's 'Campaign' series books I've read, and a rare detailed look into the tormented history of Poland, known to its people as the 'Christ of the nations'.<br />The Teutonic Order, originally ser out to battle crusades against the infidels, became a Prussian state, and its battles against the Poles, although dressed up in religious rhetoric were actually grabs for territories and power, as became increasingly apparent after the 1386 conversion of Lithuania, which the Teutonic Knights conveniently dismissed as a sham. <br />The session of hostilities between Poland and Lithuania, and Lithuania's Grand Duke Vytautas acceptance of the rule of Polish King Jagiello, led to increased confrontations with the Teutonic order, culminating in a Teutonic declaration of war and a Polish/Lithuanian invasion in 1410. The approximately 27 thousand Teutonic Knights out of whom, Turmbull estimates, only 250 were heavily mounted and armored knights (p.29) were defeated by the 39 thousand soldiers on the Polish/Lithuanian side near the village of Tannenberg on July the 15th, 1410.<br />Turnball's book begins with an introduction, tracing the events since the foundation of the Teutonic order in 1190 to the outbreak of the war. This part of the narrative was as exciting as high school history, a long list of Kings and campaigns, with very little description or analyses. I suppose it explains the background for the struggle - but that is all it does. <br />Next Turnbull gives a short description of the main protagonists, and a discussion of the troops constituting the Teutonic and Polish/Lithuanian armies. Even though the book is full of (sometimes marvelous) illustration, this part is strangely bereft of them, so the reader gets no pictures of either side's weapons or armor.<br />The description of the battle itself I found hard to follow. The great colored so called three dimensional maps of the battlefield are often put several pages away from the text's description of the events of the field, and (possibly because I'm not familiar with the format) I found them overcrowded and not clear. For example, Turnbull writes that the Teutonic may have dug pits in the battleground, but they are nowhere to be found on the maps. <br />The best parts of the book are the ones following the battle, detailing the Teutonic Order's recovery from the disastrous defeat, and the continuation of the war (sometimes through other means), until the second treaty of Thorn, in which the order essentially capitulated, and all that was left of the once vast Teutonic state was a small independent entity centered around Riga. The author then briefly considers the evolution of the Tannenberg myth until the Second World War, and how it was used for Propaganda purposed by Germans, Russians and Poles.<br />Turnbull writes that \\"the battle's true historical significance remains mired in controversy\\". Indeed, Turnbull's declaration that the Teutonic defeat \\"undoubtedly proved fatal in the long term\\" seems arguable to me. Were the Teutonic Knights fighting a desperate battle in the 1450s really doomed from the start? And if they were, was it because of a single battle defeat 40 years past? <br />I think Turnbull fails to consider the option that the collapse of the Teutonic order came not from the battlefield defeat, but from the changed political climate. The Teutonic Knights, invited to Poland by the Polish King to battle usurpers, now found against them a relatively united front of Poles and Lithuanians. And the conversion of Lithuania made it increasingly difficult to describe the wars as crusades, and to draw foreign guest crusaders.<br />The dim memory of the Teutonic Knights still reaches us through the centuries. But were theydefeated on the battleground or by the changing of the times. How was it that the Teutonic world came to an end, in a bang or in a whimper?	2004-04-08
US	51630889	R9UR9OGXHYNA	0393318877	426054309	The Accidental Theorist: And Other Dispatches from the Dismal Science	Books	3	61	66	N	N	Pop Economics	In the introduction to 'The Accidental Theorist', Paul Krugman states his ambition to do for Economics what Carl Sagan has done to Astronomy - to serve it to the intelligent public without the specialized vocabulary and the math - to popularize economics.  In so far as this book is intelligent, enlightening, and most of all - fun, Krugman has hit home run.<br />This is a book of essays, most published in Slate, but also including various speeches and pieces for other markets, such as the New York Times Magazine.  In most of them, Krugman discusses the fallacies of prominent 'Accidental Theorists' - people who get economics wrong, either through ignorance of and contempt to economics - like the 'hero' of the title essay, Rolling Stone reporter William Greider who apparently thinks that economics is &quot;not really a science so much as a value laden form of prophecy&quot; even though he doesn't know the first thing about it (p.23) - or, for those who should know better, because they are blinded by their political agenda - like Conservative house leader and professor of economics Richard Armery, whose manipulation of data Krugman exposes (pp. 58-59).<br />Krugman is celebrated as an independent scholar, deconstructing fallacies both from the left and from the right.  Even though Krugman attacks leftists wrongs (as in the aforementioned 'accidental theorist' and in a series of attacks on the dismal economic policies of socialist France), it is clear where his heart is.  Krugman is a free market Liberal, who supports active governments, both for the definition of property rights ('Taxes and Traffic Jams' pp.173-178), and for helping the poor, including funding Medicare by increasing taxation (pp. 189-190).  Krugman also attacks Supply Side Economics (in a whole section of the book titles 'Right Wing Wrongs'), and argues that inequality in American is not, for the most part, the fault of the poor (p. 54).<br />I basically share almost all of Krugman's views, and Krugmantakes care to separate his ideology from his analysis, but he is not the unbiased source he sometimes appears to be (but then again, who is?).<br />The greatest in the arsenal of weapons in Krugman's war against economic fallacies is his command of prose.  Krugman tackles difficult subject with the immense clarity and wit, and the pure joy of reading it would make this book interesting even for those who are well acquainted with economics.<br />The weakest aspects lie not in these essays themselves, but in the editing.  Krugman essentially collected the essays, arranged them according to themes, and wrote introductions to each theme.  The book suffers from several weaknesses which could have been avoided with a little more care.<br />First, there is a complete lack of scholarly apparatus that will let the reader track Krugman's facts and statements.  The book has neither footnotes nor a bibliography, and there's not even an index.<br />Second, these essays were written in the middle 1990s, during the height of the Clinton years.  They constantly refer to then current affairs.  But what was the here and now in 1997 is now then and there, and the memory of events will not become fresher as the first Bush administration comes to an end.  More background information about the situation when Krugman has written would have made this much easier to get into.<br />Finally, Krugman misses the opportunity to update us on what has happened since he has written these essays.  Several people criticized here, such as historian David Hackett Fischer, must have reacted to Krugman's and similar criticisms, but if they did, their voice here is silent.  Nor does Krugman bother to tell us how he feels the realities (such as the European Monetary Union or the troubles in Latin America) measure up to his predictions about them.  It feels like a lost opportunity - Krugman could have reconsidered these essays, instead of merely republishing them.<br />Faults aside, Paul Krugman's book mayjust be the best written book about economics I've ever read.  His prose and insights are well worth your time and money.	2004-04-05

Heilbroner calls Economists 'The worldly philosophers'. That description certainly captures what Milton Friedman does in this book - he takes the seemingly simple concept of money, the unit of exchange we use daily and rarely reflect upon, and demonstrates how complicated the issues regarding it are.<BR> <BR>(As an interesting aside, Heilbroner's original title for his book was 'the money philosophers' - a definition that fits Friedman in this book even better then his chosen title, even if it is too narrow to account for all of economics). <br />More then half of this collection of essays is about the so-called 'Crime of 1873' - America's decision, following the issuance of fiat money (that is, money irredeemable in specie) during the Civil War, to peg the dollar not to both silver and gold, but to gold alone. This seemingly arcane and academic topic was a major political issue in the 1880s and 90s, climaxing with the nomination of the silver Democrat, William Jennings Bryan to the presidency of the United States in 1896. <br />As the Unites States, along with most other 19th century nations such as Germany and France, followed Great Britain in adopting the gold standard, the price of gold rose in terms of other resources, so prices went down. Therefore there was a severe deflation causing much unrest and discontent. <br />The cure to the deflation came not through political or monetary means, however, but because of an invention of a method to extract gold from low grade ore. This increased the supply of gold, lowered its prices. Hence stopping the deflation, and killing the presidential ambitions of William Jennings Bryan. <br />The rest of the book describes various issues, from FDR's decision to 'help silver' which helped Communism in China instead (by increasing the cost of silver, overvaluing the Chinese currency and thus hurting Chinese exports and undermining the Chinese economy), to the policy of pegging a currency to the dollar (not a good idea as it subjects the country to the whims of the world economy. The policy was a grave failure to Chile and a great success to Israel, due entirely to external changes in the value of the dollar). <br />The theme of the later parts of the book is undoubtedly inflation. Friedman demonstrates his claim that inflation is \\"always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\\" (p.104). Inflation is caused by government increasing the money supply, although one time price increases may be caused by unfortunate outside events (like Arabs reduction of the exportation of oil in the early 1979s). <br />Although Friedman is well known as an economic right winger, there is nothing in this account that should be displeasing to anyone from the left - Friedman's case is against mismanagement, not for small or big governments. Nor is there any argument about whether government spending should go to the military, to welfare, or to any other cause. Although Friedman's book is filled with stories of the political economy, its moral is politically neutral. Indeed, Friedman clearly discusses how inflation is often used by governments because direct taxation is unpopular (p.205) - can you say \\"read my lips, no new taxes\\"? <br />Furthermore, the economic analysis of some reviewers in Amazon is shaky. Friedman writes \\"all these adjustments [the negative effects of inflation] are set in motion by changes in the rates of monetary growth and inflation. If monetary growth was high but steady... the economy would adjust to it. ... Such an inflation would do no great harm \\" (p.222). <br />Although Friedman does not like inflation, he actually makes a case for it, at least at a low single digit level. Since people are usually sellers of few things and purchasers of many, they are more aware of the increase in the price of the commodity they sell then they are of the increase of general prices, especially when those changes are low. People like to see their income go up, as they feel it is a just reward for their efforts (p. 70). <br />'Money Mischief' is an interesting, challenging book. Its chapters vary from the extremely technical and difficult, (notably chapter 4, a counter-factual exercise estimating the effect of continuing bimetallism after 1873), to 'pop economics' chapters which are no less enlightening and easier to read. <br />The book ends with a discussion of the new experiment started in the 1970s - currency which is entirely unredeemable by any kind of good. Earlier economists thought that this was impossible, and would necessarily lead to high inflation, but Friedman is optimistic - he believes that aware and well informed public and decision makers can pressure the government against unduly increasing the money supply. Thus, widespread understanding of economics is the real cure for inflation.	2004-03-11
US	51630889	RESUBNNCQIFZF	0252065441	401485920	The Historian's Lincoln: Pseudohistory, Psychohistory, and History	Books	4	12	12	N	Y	The Lincoln Interpreters	&quot;The Historian's Lincoln&quot; is a collection of essays coming out of a Lincoln Symposium at the 175th anniversary of his birth.  It offers a great deal of insight about Lincoln and about the Historical consciousness of the mid 1980s.  <br />One of the things I like about this volume is the commentary and criticism about almost every individual article, sometimes including counter reactions.  The reader benefits from the debate and critical analysis of the each essay.<br />The book has five parts.  The First, &quot;The Common People's Lincoln&quot;, is about Abraham Lincoln as seen in public.  A Collection of photos from 'The Face of Lincoln' prefaces a discussion of the Public perception of &quot;Honest Abe&quot;.  For instance, Lincoln's growing a beard following his victory in the 1860 election kept photographers interested in his appearance.<br />Also in this section, &quot;Abe Lincoln Laughing&quot; by P.M.Zall argues that Lincoln used his sense of humor and the funny stories to win over his audience and get his message across.  The critique, by Mark E. Neely, is that the humor was part of Lincoln's character, not an instrument for appeasing crowds. &quot;His humor was a political liability with large segments of the populace... [the] fallacy that underlies much of Zall's paper - ... the &quot;instrumental&quot; view of Lincoln's humor&quot; (p.29).<br />The second part of the book is titled &quot;Ideology and Politics&quot; and discusses some main issues of Lincoln's policies and presidency.  In &quot;Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream&quot;, Editor Gabor S. Boritt argues that the American Dream &quot;the prosperity and liberties of the people&quot; in Lincoln's words, were the goals Lincoln cared most about, and he defended the Union as the vehicle for it (p. 100).  <br />The Critiques of this interesting essay are not very convincing.  M. E. Bradford elaborates on how unfairly he has been treated by critics.   His claims: Lincoln did prefer Freedom over slavery, constitutional rights over Tyranny and peace over war, &quot;other things being equal&quot; ,but he stuck by his ideals only so long as they &quot;fed fuel into that little engine that knew no rest, his political ambition&quot; (p.110).  His argument consists of a few lawsuits Lincoln filed which were related to Slavery, his anti-Black sayings, and lots of Latin words supposed to impress the reader.<br />Phillip S. Paludan's critique is somewhat more substantial, but it amounts to, essentially, stating his dislike for the industrial revolution.<br />The second essay, Glen E. Thurow's &quot;Abraham Lincoln and American Political Religion&quot; deals with a contradiction between Lincoln's Gettysburg address and his second inaugural.  In the Gettysburg address, Lincoln says the Civil War is a test: whether democracy can survive.  It is a problem of Free Will - Americans must prove their ability to defend the Jeffersonian values of equality.  The second inaugural deals with predestination - God's justice in making Americans pay for their sin of slavery, even if &quot;every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn by the sword&quot; (Lincoln, p. 128).  Thus the inaugural, claiming that the Civil War is the unraveling of God's justice, undermines Lincoln's claim that it as a test.  Thurow's solution - the second inaugural &quot;transcends&quot; the Gettysburg address.  One is from the point of view of the nation, the other from that of God.  Thurow argues that &quot;These perspectives do not abolish each other; neither expresses the whole truth&quot; (p. 140).  You may find this more convincing then I do - it seems to me that this is merely one of the inherent contradictions in postulations about God - if the Lord is righteous, free will could not exist.<br />David A. Nichols's &quot;Lincoln and the Indians&quot; discusses the relations between the Sixteenth president and Native Americans.  Essentially, Lincoln was well meaning but too busy with the Civil War to help American Indians, and his racist views affected him.<br />The weakest of the essay in this section is Lawanda Cox's &quot;Lincoln and Black Freedom&quot; arguing that Lincoln, though racist, was a great friend of the blacks.<br />The third section, titled &quot;The Psychohistorian's Lincoln&quot;, is about Psychohistory, a historical method that was briefly popular in the 1980s.  It attempts to use the insights of psychoanalysis in History.  Psychohistory seems to have gone away with the eighties, and if these essays are any indication, that is no great loss for scholarship.  <br />The psychohistorians make claims which are sometimes surprising, but usually merely silly.  Charles B. Strozier argues that &quot;after 1854 [Lincoln] found his private concerns with intimacy and a troubled union [his marriage] reflected in the country&quot; (p. 405).  Dwight G. Anderson argues that the dead President Lincoln saw in his dream in April 1865 was George Washington, and that Lincoln was his &quot;ghostly assassin&quot; (p. 254).  In a slightly saner mold, George B. Forgie argues that Lincoln believed that the real threat to the Union was not the South, but a few evil conspirators in the leadership of the Democratic party, and that when the young Lincoln argued that the threat for the republic was in talented, over ambitious men who would turn into Tyrants, &quot; [It] seems obvious enough:  Lincoln had himself in mind when he composed the entire speech.&quot;(p.296).<br />The section titled &quot;Assassinations&quot; deals with Lincoln's murder in history and historiography, and particularly with the conspiracy theories that grew after the Death, believing everyone from secretary of war Stanton the Freemasons to be behind the assassination.<br />The Final section, &quot;The Lincoln Biographies&quot; contains book reviews by Richard N. Current and Don E. Fehernbacher.  Current is enthusiastic about Stephen Oates's &quot;With MaliceTowards None&quot;, but argues that Oates makes Lincoln more of a radical then he really was.  Feherenbacher's discussion of Gore Vidal's Lincoln is sadly all too brief, but it is a fascinating if inconclusive discussion about the criteria upon which historical works of fiction should be evaluated.<br />'The Historian's Lincoln' is a fascinating read, and even the essays about Psychohistory, which are hardly illuminating about Lincoln, tell us much about the Historian of the title.	2004-02-19

Smith has made quite an achievement: he took two topics which I personally find fascinating - American Negro Slavery and Historiography - and managed to produce a sordid essay, that is almost entirely unenlightening and literally painful to read.<br />Smith's book exposes the opinions of scholars of slavery on several key questions about the 'peculiar institution':  Was slavery profitable?  Were slave owners Capitalists?  And to what extent did the owners control the life and culture of slaves?<br />Smith's answer to all these questions seems to be a variation on 'to an extent'.  Slaveholders were part Capitalist and part not Capitalists, and what is Capitalism anyway?  The Slaves had their own culture but where very influenced by the masters, etc.  I don't mind ambiguity and nuance in analysis, but Smith comes off not as complex but as indecisive.<br />It doesn't help that Smith's narrative is little more then a list of scholars's opinions, along with citations and reference.  There are some attempts to flash out the argument (often using graphs and charts), but those are halfhearted.  Smith seems to think that reference is a substitute for an argument.<br />In what is essentially an extended bibliographical essay, one would expect a useful list of works sited.  Unfortunately, even that is not properly done.  After a short list of 'general books', Smith goes on to put a separate bibliography for each chapter, without repeating titles.  As a result, if you are trying to locate a reference to a book in chapter five, for instance, you may have to look through the bibliographies of all the preceding chapters, as the work you're looking for may be mentioned in any of them.<br />All in all, Debating Slavery is a mercilessly bad book.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it is short; but that just means it's overpriced  :-)	2004-02-14

It is the story of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and of the birth of the Modern Middle East from its ashes.  It tells of the rise of nationalism, of the clashes of armies, and of the power of ideologies.  Mostly, it is the story of how the great statesmen, in ignorance and folly, with motives which professed to be pure but usually weren't, accidentally created the Middle East we know and hate today.<br />With the outbreak of the Great War, the status quo antebellum in the Middle East was shattered.  Until the war, British policy was to use the nations of the Middle East (although they didn't know it by that name) as a barrier against expansionist Czarist Russia, which, in the four hundred years leading to the war has expanded in a rate of 50 square miles a day (p. 475).  The British main interest was to keep the Ottoman Empire existing.  Although situation in the Empire changed a little with the rise of Nationalism, Zionism, and especially the Young Turks movement, the European policy has not quite changed.  Indeed, as the war was breaking out, the Ottoman Empire was seen as a state of no importance, and the British continually underestimated it, in a sequence of errors which brought the Empire into the war on the German side, and which culminated in the Gallipoli fiasco.<br />Yet as the war progressed, British officials started to change their view.  Great confusion and indecision characterized British decision making, torn between those who saw the East as the key to victory in the war (Lloyd George), those who saw it as a distraction of no importance (Lord Kitchener), and the various bureaucracies who battled for control, power and prestige, while supporting two different and opposing factions in Arabia - King Hussein of Mecca and Wahabbi leader Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud.<br />Increasingly, the British saw the key to the Middle East policy in an upcoming Arab Rebellion, headed by King Hussein.  In reality, Hussein held little more power then any other Emir in Arabia, and whatever troops he had were bought with British gold.  When his rebellion finally came, it hardly affected the outcome of the war, and whatever aid it did give came primarily because of the Gold and influence of T.E. Lawrence on Hussein's son Feisal.<br />The reality had little effect on British policy makers, and particularly on Mark Sykes, the maverick amateur who negotiated the unworkable agreement with the French on partitioning the Middle East between the two powers.  Almost before the ink dried on the Sykes-Pico agreements, however, British officials, both in Cairo and in London, started to undermine the agreement, wishing to give no real independence to the Arabs and make as few concessions as necessary to the French.<br />Things became increasingly complicated as the British became aware of the Zionist claim to Palestine, while Czarist Russia fell and America entered the war on an idealistic but unrealistic platform of independence to the minor nations.  As the war came to an end and the negotiations in Paris started, Lloyd George's government wrestled with its conflicting pledges, the situation in the Middle East which it barely understood, and the increasingly anti-Imperialist feeling at Home.  The Result was a mess, as the British alienated all of her friends (the Arabs by not granting them real independence, the Turks by supporting Greek occupation of Smyrna, the French by opposing its own colonialist designs in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and America by continuing the imperialist plan with a new Rhetoric), and had to fight uprisings throughout the Middle East with a dwindling force, due to the lack of support for the imperialist efforts at home.<br />What David Fromkin calls the Settlement of 1922, with the Middle East in boarders more or less as they are today, with new Units such as Palestine (now Israel), Syria, Trans-Jordan and Lebanon in place, was brought more by exhaustion then by the will of the Foreign (Primarily British) statesmen who shaped it.  By the end of the War, Fromkin writes \\"British Society was generally inclined to reject the idealistic case for imperialism (that it would extend the benefits of advanced civilization to a backward region) as quixotic, and the practical case for it (that it would benefit Britain to expend her empire) as untrue.\\" (p. 561)... Britain's Empire, though greater than it has ever been, was no longer feasible, and the Imperialist design for the Middle East, planned in the middle of the War and imposed after it, unworkable.  \\"British policy-makers imposed a settlement upon the Middle East in 1922 in which, for the most part, they themselves no longer believed\\"(p. 563, italics in the original).<br />The most astonishing theme of the book is the utter ignorance of the decision makers, primarily in London, but also in Cairo, Mecca, Berlin and Washington.  \\"Lloyd George, who o kept demanding that Britain should rule Palestine from (in the biblical phrase) Dan to Beersheba, did not know where Dan was.  He searched for it in a nineteenth-century Biblical atlas, but it was not until nearly a year after the armistice that General Allenby was able to report to him that Dan has been located and, as it was not where the Prime Minister wanted it to be, Britain asked for a boundary further North.<br />'A Peace to End All Peace' gives a fascinating and disturbing portrait of WW1 decision makers.

US	51630889	R24BJU9JWHKCZG	0195147103	53004101	Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	The Opium of the Masses, the Madness of the Few	There is now a bona fide genre of 'Sceptic' writings, which are probably familiar to people interested in Robert L. Park's \\"Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud\\".  Along with the likes of Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, Michael Shermer and James Randi, Park attacks pseudoscience and stresses the importance of rationality.<br />\\"Voodoo Science\\" proves to be one of the better examples of this genre.  Although it doesn't quite match Carl Sagan's brilliant \\"The Demon Haunted World\\", Park's book is noteworthy for three main reasons:  The creative structure and fine prose, the choice of the targets, and the underlying theme of this book - how Voodoo Science is a journey from sincere errors through self delusion to outright fraud.<br />Park's writing is elegant and easy to read.  I've finished 'Voodoo Science' within two days, a tribute both to the shortness of the book and to Park's ability as a storyteller.  Furthermore, Park explains science well; I particularly liked his explanation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics (\\"You can't win\\" and \\"You can't break even, either\\").  Unlike most of these kinds of book, Park chooses to tell stories throughout the book, and as a consequence gives the feeling of a plot unravelling.  Park also manages to tell similar stories together, proving that while fools change, the foolishness remains the same.<br />Park's choice of targets is also an advantage.  Part of it is that Park's book is recent, and that many of the scandals are relatively new (the 80s and 90s, rather then the 60s and 70s as in many other such books).  But it is more then that - Park picks on phenomena which reached bodies - US Congress, Prime Time US TV, and NASA - who should have known better.<br />The best chapters in the book are the fourth and eight.  \\"The Virtual Astronaut\\" attacks manned flights to space, and argues that they are huge vanity projects of little practical value.  It is a forceful suggestion, and one that is actually quite bold - unlike UFOs, Astrology and Creationism, Space travel is dear to the hearts of many sceptics, myself included.  Nonetheless, Park's case is convincing.  As presently carried out, Manned Space Exploration is a waste of time and money, and as the recent disaster of the Columbia space shuttle has demonstrated, dangerous as well.<br />I do wish that Park would discuss some ideas which might make manned space travel a more practical possibility, particularly the proposal for a space elevator - a satellite connected with a cable to earth, on which it would be possible to 'climb' to space.<br />Chapter 8, \\"Judgement Day\\" discusses attempts by the US Jurisprudence to fight Junk Science - the use of science to bewilder and bedazzle laypersons, and especially juries.  The US Supreme Court ruled that it is the Judge's role to be a gatekeeper, to distinguish for the Jury between real and fake science, using outside experts if necessary.  I wish Park had elaborated on this issue more, presenting some of the obstacles to this (such as who is qualified to decide, in concrete cases and on a tight schedule, what is or isn't voodoo science), and the dissenting opinions of the Supreme Court.  If Judges have to decide for the jury what science is or isn't, aren't we approaching the point where the judiciary dictates the trial's results?  Does the Judge replace the \\"Jury of one's peers\\" as the agent who finds the defendant guilty or innocent?  And if so, is it a good or bad thing?<br />The main current of the book, its thesis, is an examination of the subtitle's \\"Road from Foolishness to Fraud\\". The how and when of inventors getting lost in their own hype, beginning to lie rather then admit they were wrong. This is an interesting theme which Park could have followed more closely with an inside look at people on that road.  Alas, no such a description is given.  I would have been particularly interested in an interview with Michael Guillen, the book's anti-hero, a physicist who \\"documents\\" all forms of paranormal folly for prime time TV.  An anthropologist's inside view on the scandal would have greatly added to Park's book.<br />Such minor flaws not withstanding, Robert L. Park wrote an interesting and fun to read debunking book.

The trip keeps getting postponed and altered, but I hope to go around April-May, and one place I will certainly visit is the best known of America's Civil War battlefields, the greatest defeat of Robert E. Lee, and the place where the Union was (arguably) saved: Gettysburg.<br />James McPherson, distinguished scholar of the Civil War and Pulitzer Price winning author of 'Battle Cry of Freedom' is an ideal tour guide for Gettysburg, and &quot;Hallowed Ground: A Walk in Gettysburg&quot; describes his tour.<br />As usual, McPherson's prose is effortless and delightful.  McPherson explains well the battle events, from the points of view of generals and privates, both Federal and Confederate.  He discusses various historical controversies, and the post CW commemorations, which sometimes served purposes which were not entirely historical.  McPherson also draws on his own scholarship, notably on his book 'For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War' to explain various aspects of the fighting, and especially the courage of soldiers, such as those in Pickett's charge, who fought uphill against a screen of fire and died in the thousands.<br />When McPherson reaches the end of the tour in the Confederacy's high water mark - the furthest places where Pickett's men reached - you get a clear understanding of the structure of the battle in Gettysburg, and in the role of key divisions and men, from Custer and Chamberlain to Lee, Longstreet and Meade.<br />Although both entertaining and insightful, McPherson's book has several weaknesses.  Firstly, from a value for money point of view, it is short and expensive.  It contains only four maps and no photographs.<br />The maps are not very clear, and I (an admitted novice in Gettysburg geography) often struggled to understand where several places were.  The map of downtown Gettysburg is almost entirely useless, and there is no map of the tour itself!<br />Although McPherson is as insightful and interesting as I've come to expect of him, he recycles himself a bit, repeating anecdotes and quotations that appear in his other works.  Also, relatively little attention was paid to the history of Gettysburg in the 140 years since the battle.  Stories of later events are anecdotal, with no attempt to structure or put things into context.  The book contains neither endnotes nor a bibliography, so the reader cannot use this book as a jump point for further studies (Unlike McPherson's 'Battle Cry of Freedom', which contains one of the best bibliographical essays I've ever encountered).<br />Finally, from a practical point of view, 'Hallowed Ground' contains absolutely zero &quot;getting there and around&quot; information.  We are not even given an estimate for how long the tour of Gettysburg should last.  Is it doable in a full day?  Two?<br />I genuinely enjoyed 'Hallowed Ground', and I understand Gettysburg much better after having read it, and if you're interested in the American Civil War, this is a worthy addition to your book collection.aps and no photographs.<br />The maps are not very clear, and I (an admitted novice in Gettysburg geography) often struggled to understand where several places were.

US	51630889	R2ZV6XZVH6THMY	0195093879	737119199	A History of the Supreme Court	Books	3	22	23	N	Y	Judges, Judgements, and Judicial Review	Bernard Schwartz's \\"A History of the Supreme Court\\" is a readable if dry narrative of the 200 years of the Supreme Court between John Jay and William Rhenquist.  The story of the supreme court is a complicated one, and for the most part, Schwartz tells it well.  If his book is short on analysis and long on description, it is probably more due to the nature of the subject then to the qualities of the author.    Schwartz focuses on two main themes in the narrative.  The first one, addressed in the Prologue and in the first few chapters, deal with the practice of Judicial Review in Anglo-Saxon common law, and especially in the early US, where under Chief Justice Marshall, the supreme court has been established as SUPREME - that is, in position to pass judgment on State legislators, State courts, and even the US Congress.    The theme is very prominent in the early history of the Court, where the Supreme Court fulfilled its Hamiltonian role as the final authority on the constitutionality of law.  Very early, US Justices have proved that they were every bit the politicians as the Jurists - Chief Marshall successfully established Judicial Review in his Marbury vs. Madison decision, while Roger B Taney catastrophically endangered it in his attempt to end the political crisis of the Union via his Dred Scott Decision.      Later in the book, Schwartz still devotes time to the question of Judicial Review, but then in a new disguise - that of Judicial restraint, which Schwartz first sees in the actions of Roger B Taney, but which were only manifested plainly in the dissents of Oliver Wendell Holmes, most famously in the Lochner vs. New York case (1905), where the majority judges, led by Rufus W. Peckham, substituted its judgement to that of the legislative branch, and ruled a law restricting working hours unconstitutional (See [[ASIN:0700609199 Lochner v. New York: Economic Regulation on Trial]]).  Under Judicial Restraint, the Supreme Court was only to overrule laws which noreasonable person could say were constitutional.    The other major theme in Schwartz's narrative is the switch from the primacy of property rights in the 19th century, to the supremacy of personal rights in the 20th.  As the US came to allow much more government intervention in the economy, Schwartz argues, the rights of the private citizen, and especially the rights guaranteed in the bill of rights and the right of privacy had to be privileged.  This tendency reached its climax in the Warren court, and particularly in the Brown vs. Board of Education decision.  Surprisingly, though, the subsequent Burger court did not overthrow the trend.  Rather, important personal rights rulings (such as Miranda) were affirmed, and even the right to abortion was guaranteed, as a right included within the right of privacy.  The Rhenquist Court, though even more conservative then the Berger Court, has yet to turn the tables on Warren's revolution; indeed, the recent judgement against anti-Homosexual laws in Texas is another landmark civil rights decision.    Schwartz's book is interesting and thorough, but is not without flaws.  The writing is somewhat crude, and Schwartz quotes other historians much too much.  Schwartz has also an irritating tendency to use the same quote several times, and one quote from judge Frankfurter appears four times at least.  The book also has the annoying tendency to assume all the readers are Americans.    Worse, sometimes Schwartz's scholarship is lacking.  In the case of Dred Scott vs. Sandford, for example, Schwartz's makes no reference to the classic study by Don E. Fehernbacher ([[ASIN:0195145887 The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics]]), either in the text or in the bibliography.  As a consequence, several of Schwartz's conclusion are somewhat distorted, and sometimes his views come out of the blue entirely.  Thus Schwartz calls Stephen Douglas \\"the chief political victim of the Dred Scott Decision\\" [p.124] which is inaccurate and highly misleading.  In the short run, Douglas's popularity in the South did not diminish after the Dred Scot decision, and when it did, it was due to his opposition to the Lecompton constitution - not to Dred Scott.  In any event, Schwartz completely ignores the sectional split within the Democratic Party, a split that was indeed seemingly worsened by the Dred Scott decision, which abandoned ambiguity in favour of an endorsement of the Southern view.     Ultimately, Schwartz's book is both instructive and readable.  If it is does not quite warrant a general endorsement, it is a good primer for those interested in American legal history.	2003-12-21

Although the stories of the 'fearful lizards' and of the men (and woman) who discovered them is interesting, the history of evolutionary ideas within is the best part.<br />The large cast of characters here includes an eccentric but brilliant academic (William Buckland), a scoundrel fossil collector (Thomas Hawkins), a distinguished anatomist (Richard Owen) and a working class woman, deprived of her rightful status because of Victorian social conservatism (Mary Anning).<br />With the increasing number of fossils discovered, and the increase in knowledge in other areas, Modern science was wrestling itself out of religious dogma, and the arguments about it are the core of this book.<br />Among the chief arguments at the time was whether the global, Noachian Flood existed, or not.  Great disputes about these question took place, between supporters and the so called anti-Diluvians, who opposed it .  <br />An even greater controversy was the one surrounding evolution ('transmutation' in the vernacular).  Transmutationism was a bona fide heresy, and when the young Charles Darwin enters McGowan's narrative, he has to hide his views from Richard Owen, a great scientist who coined the very term 'Dinosaur', but whose opposition to transmutation was well known.<br />One of the major advantages of this book is the way in which it can forgive the scientists for their errors.  Although McGowan clearly points out the mistakes, and how the likes of Owen, Buckland and Charles Lyell (who was a major influence, and a confident, of Darwin's) allowed their pre conceived notions to deter them from reaching the truth, he discusses how it is that science advances despite these failures.  The errors and pre-conceived notions of individuals can hinder science, but the setbacks are merely temporary, and these scientists, for all their errors, held lay down the ground for Darwin's breathtaking insights.<br />My one greatest regret for this book is that it does not include the reaction of the surviving 'dragon seekers' to Darwin's 'The Origin of Species'.  Richard Owen's responses, especially, would have been very interesting, and would have made an interesting summation for the book.<br />Instead, McGowan chooses to dedicate his conclusion to today's collectors, the followers of Mary Anning's.  It is both interesting and moving, as McGowan has studies fossils discovered in the very beaches were the Anning and co. have worked.  So modern paleontologists, too, depend upon the newest generation of dragon seekers	2003-12-02
US	51630889	RB20HLFNCQLT0	0304352845	423622789	The Punic Wars	Books	4	4	4	N	N	The Clash of Civilizations	Between 265 and 146 BC, the world has seen some of the greatest conflicts in history, rarely matched and probably unsurpassed until the 20th century.  The three Punic wars took place in Italy, Spain, Greece, Sicily, Sardinia and Africa.  They saw wide scales battles on land, huge clashes of fleets, sieges and treacheries.  And they have left to the world the legacy of one of the legendary war heroes.  Hannibal, with his daring passage through the Alps and his remarkable victories in Italy, belongs now to the ages, holding the romantic fascination which belongs only to a few generals who reached the brightest glory but have finally failed (like Robert E. Lee, Rommel and Napoleon).<br />For those, like me, who come to this book innocent of the late Roman Republic, Adrian Goldsworthy's account explains the background, politics and world of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, and gives as much light as possible to figures whose life is shadowed by the lack of historical records.<br />With risk of oversimplification, the first Punic War was the almost inevitable clash between two growing empires, whose spheres of influence overlapped.  Carthage and Rome first fought over Sicily, with the fighting spreading to Africa and to the Mediterranean.  After several defeats, The Carthaginians agreed to a peace agreement, which put them in a clearly subordinate position to Rome.  With fresh insult in the form of the Roman annexation of Sardinia in 238, Hannibal Barca started the war in Spain in 218, and then marched to Italy, to wage war in the enemy territory.  Hannibal, and Carthage, failed, and the war ended with a treaty that put Carthage in a clearly subordinate position to Rome. <br />The last Punic war, and the destruction of Carthage, came from the paranoia of the Romans, immortalized by Cato's famous saying \\"Delenda Carthago\\".  Carthage must be destroyed, and so it was.<br />`The Punic Wars' (or `The Fall of Carthage', in the British edition) is a military history, detailing both specific battles and the general strategy of the three Punic Wars.  For the most part, Goldsworthy does a good job summarizing and explaining the battles and movements of forces, as well as the disagreements between scholars about the exact locations of battles, and so on.  However, some of the maps are clearly insufficient, especially as Goldsworthy never gives more then one map to any one battle, even the complicated ones, such as the confrontation between Hannibal and Scipio Africanus in Zama in 2002.  Furthermore, there is a lot of discussion of various forms of ships, without a single diagram of them.<br />The overall theme of Goldsworthy's book is that the Punic wars were more then just clashes between Empires.  They saw clashes between two different philosophies of war, or, if you will, cultures.  The Carthaginians, as was customary at the time, fought in order to establish the power balance between the sides.  A war was supposed to end with an agreement that will reflect this balance.  The Romans, on the other hand, could not see different countries of city states as independent.  The Romans fought total wars, which ended in either the subjugation of the destruction of the enemy.  For the Carthaginians, loss was unfortunate, for the Romans it was inconceivable.<br />Only at one point during the Punic wars, there was a real chance of Roman defeat.  After his remarkable victory in Canne in 216 BC, Hannibal chose not to go for Rome.  \\"It is probably correct that Hannibal would have been unable to capture Rome if the defenders had put up any sort of resistance\\", Goldsworthy writes (p. 216).  Still, \\"Hannibal now posted a greater threat to the Roman Republic then any other foreign power would ever do throughout its entire history\\".  Would the Romans have withstood Hannibal at the peak of his power, or would they have agreed to sign a peace agreement?  Had the Carthaginians won the Punic Wars, history would have been very different  - but we will never know howclose they were.	2003-11-28

I've read just enough to be intrigued ' it was only when I read it back in Israel that I realized I stumbled upon a fine introduction to the scholarship of Jesus.<br />'The Jesus Debate: Modern Historians Investigate the Life of Christ' focuses on scholars who depict Jesus in the late 20th century.  Its style reminds me of 'Explaining Hitler: A Quest to the Root of His Evil' by Ron Rosenbaum.  Both demonstrate how an important historical figure can be seen through many different angles, and, significantly, both owe an acknowledged debt to Albert Schweitzer's classic 'The Quest of the Historical Jesus'.  Both also discuss exclusively American and to a lesser extent British writers, with an almost complete disregard to Historians from the rest of the world.<br />The most useful chapters in the book are the early ones, where Powell goes through some of the basics of modern biblical studies.  I finally figured out  the differences between the synoptic gospels, the apocryphal gospels, and the reconstructed Q Gospel.  There is also an interesting historiography of modern Jesus studies, from the late 18th century till the middle of the twentieth, and discussions of various criteria of Authenticity of parts of the NT.<br />Chapters 4-9 depicts the various attempts to explain Jesus.  There is a chapter about the 'Jesus Seminar', an attempt of multiple scholars to vote for the authenticity of sayings and events depicted in the Canonical Gospels and in the Gospel of Thomas.  Powell explain well both the value and the weaknesses of the Seminar, and stresses that the Seminar did not really rule out much of the Gospel as unreal.  Rather, the Seminar decisively went for a minimal reconstruction of what Jesus said and did.  Even a few Black votes (officially a black vote would mean 'I would not include this item in the primary database', or 'There's gottabe some mistake' colloquially) could drag down a passage into the Grey zone ('This information is possible but unreliable' or 'Well, maybe').  Therefore, that the Seminar found almost 20% of Jesus's saying in the Gospels to be authentic does not seem so revolutionary.<br />The rest of the chapters vary, although they are all interesting.  In each one, Powell represents a point of view (i.e. John Dominic Crossan's 'Jesus the Social Revolutionary' or Marcus Borg's 'Jesus the Religious Mystic'), and also includes criticisms and implications of these perspectives.<br />Basically, the current Jesus debate ranges between two axis ' on the one hand, there are those, like John Crossan, who see Jesus as a Hellenised Jew, highly influenced by the ideas of the gentile environment.  On the other hand, Scholars like John P. Meier see Jesus as very much the traditional Jew, working and thinking along classical Jewish lines, although not necessarily without innovations.  The second axis is about the content of Jesus's message ' was it primarily secular, focusing on the here-and-now (The Jesus Seminar) or was Jesus Eschatological, a Mystic or some sort of prophet of the apocalypse?<br />One weakness of the accounts is that Powell tends to overstate the confidence we can have in conclusions about Jesus.  'A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago '[one could] maintain that the person Jesus never existed.  Anyone who says that today ' in the academic world at least ' get grouped with the skinheads who say there was no holocaust and the scientific holdouts who want to believe the world is flat' (p. 180).<br />Hardly.  What is the evidence for the existence of Jesus?  A few words of Josephus, which may be later additions, and which anyway were written decades after the fact, and a series of immediately suspect religious texts, which were also written many years after the alleged Crucifixion.  Although it is likely that Jesus did in fact exist, to say that we are as sure about it as we of the Earthbeing round (approximately) is ridiculous.<br />As a consequence, it seems almost impossible to differentiate between the various contradictory accounts of Jesus.  Strangely, I found the most appealing aspects of the narrative to be the contradictory stories of Crossan and Wright ' one an egalitarian philosopher, the other a self proclaimed Messiah (who was right in all of his prophecies).  Both figures are fascinating ' but is either of them true?<br />the author's methodology decides to a large extent which is the true Jesus.  Whether Q is much older and more reliable then Mathew and Luke, and whether John and Thomas are relatively recent myth or early, authentic tradition, makes all the difference.  Curiously, Powell ignores the question of the authenticity almost entirely.  A one page discussion declares Mark the oldest, and Mathew and Luke to be later traditions.  The vital questions about the antiquity of Q and Thomas are never addressed.<br />So who was Jesus?  John Dominic Crossan sums it up best in a quote that appears on the back-cover:<BR>'It's impossible to avoid the suspicion that historical Jesus is a very safe place to do theology and call it history, to do autobiography and call it historiography'.	2003-11-14
US	51630889	R3EXGECKPIIHJZ	1565636414	444317877	To Kill and Take Possession: Law, Morality, and Society in Biblical Stories	Books	5	12	12	N	N	The Bible's Law and the Law's Bible	Daniel Friedmann's stimulating account of the bible as seen from the point of view of a modern legal scholar was first published in Israel in 2000.  I have read the Hebrew original, so this is a review of that edition, rather then of the Translation.  All Translations from the book are mine.<br />(Strangely enough, in the Hebrew version, the English title of the book is given as 'To Kill and Inherit', and the author's name as Daniel Friedman - I shall follow the titles from Amazon).<br />In the preface, the author describes his purpose as 'to learn from the biblical tales the perception of law and morality expressed in them, and in the legal system they are based upon, a system which I believe does not correspond with many of the laws specified in the bible' (p.5).  For example, according to the law, a married woman who sleeps with another man is forbidden for both of them.  Furthermore, both of the unfaithful deserve death.  Yet, After David sleeps with Bat-Sheva, he murders her husband and then marries her.  Neither of them suffers any consequences, although God does punish David with the death of their innocent son. (p.103)<br />Although most of 'To Kill and Take Possession' focuses on the Old Testament (and especially the book of Genesis, and the books of Samuel and Kings), the author does refer to many other sources, including folklore, European history, the New Testament and Islamic law.  Friedmann is particularly interested in the way in which the bible stories, and the apparent contradictions between them and the Jewish laws, were dealt with by later Jewish interpreters.  In the end, the judgement must be \\"quite badly\\".<br />For example, in the David and Bat Sheva affair, some Jewish interpretations claims that, when going to war, soldiers left letters of retroactive divorce, so that, in the case of their death, they would divorce their wives from the beginning of the campaign.  Of course, not only is this explanation nowhere in the text, the consequence isthat by murder, David absolves himself of sin.  (p. 103) <br />Another explanation was that Uriah was a traitor to the King, by refusing David's command to return to his house - but it is entirely unsupported by the biblical text as well - had Uriah been guilty at disobedience, David could have executed him publicly, instead of arranging his death in battle (p. 104).<br />In addition to discussing Biblical law, Friedmann also tries to salvage the actual events from the biblical narrative, which is extremely biased on some accounts.  King Saul is punished for what must have been trivial offences - like making a sacrifice himself instead of waiting for high priest Samuel.  David, a traitor who collaborates with the enemies of Israel, a man who was declared King in secret, is perceived as the just King, and his crimes are continually white washed.  At the same time, the coup organized by Solomon and his followers against Adoniahu, the oldest of David's surviving sons, is also portrayed in the best possible way.  Strangely, the bible describes the deceptions carried out by Solomon's people, led by Nathan the Prophet and Beniahu, leader of the garrison in Jerusalem (pp. 260-263).  Friedmann speculates that this is another case of the different morality between Biblical times and our days - deception was seen as a tribute to the deceiver's wisdom, not as fraud (p.264).<br />'To Kill and Take Possession' is a large book, dealing with issues as far apart as the changing role of prophecy, the rules of royal succession, the role of God in the affair of men and the criminal system, the Jewish treatment of widows, and more.  An overriding theme is the heavy influence of the non-Jewish environment on the Jewish people.  Thus, Sefaradi Jews, living in Polygamic Muslim countries, kept the practice of polygamy, while Ashkenzi Jews, living in Christian Monogamic society forbade it.  Today, the censor on polygamy enacted by Ashkenzi sage Rabbi Gershom \\"The Light of the Diaspora\\", isenforced in Israel on all Jews, and Polygamy is forbidden (pp. 297-99)<br />'To Kill and Take Possession' will change the way you perceive biblical events.  Its rational, intelligent and critical look of the bible is fascinating and enriching.  If you're interested in the most important book of Western Civilization, this book is for you.	2003-10-25
US	51630889	R11L6KPFBD6OK7	0520204727	291670755	Senator Joe McCarthy	Books	3	9	16	N	N	American Madness: The Rise and Fall of Senator Joe McCarthy	Just before the American Civil War, a Southern congressman explained why Abraham Lincoln's election was a sufficient cause for secession.  He said that it was not merely the election of dangerous man, which he realized was part of the political process.  Abraham Lincoln, he argued, was elected because he was dangerous.<br />Senator McCarthy was not elected because he was dangerous.  That McCarthy came to dominate American politics for the last years of the Truman administration and the first few couple of years of the Eisenhower administration was unforeseen by anyone, least of all himself.  His rise from anonymity to become among the strongest people in the Unites States, and therefore in the world, was sudden.  His decline was even faster, and if McCarthy started 1954 as a major player, by January 1955 Vice President Nixon could report that he was no longer any danger to the administration.<br />Richard H Rovere, a journalist and an observer of the politics, wrote in 1959 what was seen at the time as the definite account of the Senator from Wisconsin.  Rovere, a master of prose, is best when making a psychological portrait of McCarthy, seeing him as an empty cynic, a vain man who believed in nothing, who hunted not for power, but for money and glory.  He was a dangerous man, who turned America away from important foreign policy issues and focused on looking for spies, traitors and \\"bad security risks\\" - and, although he terrorized the government, forced conformity, and shrank American freedoms, never found any.<br />Yet there is also a certain mischievous appreciation in Rovere's description.  He says that McCarthy was not in the Republican San Francisco convention of 1956, and that it was duller for his absence (p. 242).  His descriptions of McCarthy's manipulation of the press, the way he knew how to create a story, appreciates the ingenuity of the Senator.    And if McCarthy was a cynic, who ruined people who have not sinned, he also did it without spite or malice.  As Rovere has it, McCarthy never took himself seriously, even as the world did (p. 58)<br />Perhaps the best insight Rovere has into McCarthy is his description of McCarthy's great innovation \\"The Multiple Untruth\\".  Not a single lie or even a few, McCarthy's lies were so huge and inconsistent, that they were almost impossible to disprove.   Any part of it that you knocked down would also make the rest seem the more solid.  McCarthy blew so much smoke that people assumed there must have been a fire somewhere.  <BR> <BR>Rovere's greatest weakness is in explaining the chronology of McCarthy, and the background.  Much of it is because he wrote for people of 1959, who knew the general outline.  But for people with only a very general knowledge of the 1950s, Rovere's book never quite explains things all the way through.   This is especially bad in his description of the Army-McCarthy hearings.  As someone who is not very familiar with the events, I emerged from that vital part only slightly more enlighted then before.<br />Another failure is the journalistic defense of sources, which keeps several of the people involved disguised.  It is a little annoying to have pages devoted to either an \\"unnamed reporter\\" or to an \\"X\\".<br />Both failures could have been addressed by the introduction, written in 1996 by historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr.  Unfortunately, except for a few none too revealing comments on Rovere himself, Schlesinger chose to waste his introduction on a summery of the book's argument.<br />If the lack of background and specifics make the book a less then perfect history of McCarthy and his time, Rovere's fantastic prose make it a most pleasurable read nonetheless.  <br />His discussion of the effectiveness of McCarthy's networks of informants:  \\"If any communists [existed in the government agency], they were so well hidden that the sort of people who were in the underground [i.e. McCarthy's informants], would never find them - unless, of course, some of those in the underground were communists, which was not altogether out of the question\\". (pp. 197-98)<br />Elsewhere, Rovere comments that \\"Hollywood has always been a hotbed of conformity, and advertising it always ready to ride with any hounds.  By their very nature, these institutions yield before external pressure; it is, in fact their substitute for inspiration\\".<br />Though dated, Rovere's is still a fascinating and very well written study.	2003-10-18

The second, 'Constitutions and Constitutionalism in the Slaveholding South' deals with constitutions in Southern states, the South's views of the US constitution, and finally, the Confederate constitution and its applications during the short life span of the Confederacy.<br />Both essays, and especially the second, suffer from the shortness of the lecture format.  Fehrenbacher can only barely touch upon the issues he raise here, particularly in the second essay, which deals with three separate issues.<br />Although Fehrenbacher has written often about the sectional crises, he always manages to look at the issues from a new perspective.  Here, Fehrenbacher focuses on the South's perspective.  He shows that the Missouri crisis was not a secession crisis, but that it played a large part in developing Southern strategies for dealing with future conflicts.  The South has learned that the North could be pressured with threats of secession, and used the threat to have its way in the following crisis.  After winning the first two sectional crisis, the South lost the third.  Unlike the previous secession crisis, the South finally seceded because of an occurrence in the executive rather then the legislative branch of government.  Unlike Congress, where negotiations led naturally to some form of compromise or at least the appearance of compromise, the election of an anti-Slavery president was a clear signal, a black or white issue, and the most logical and natural basis for secession.<br />The second essay, less coherent, is nonetheless interesting.  The Southern state constitutions, because they reflected little conflict with antislavery feelings, proved to be remarkably similar to Northern state constitution.  In the relationship with the constitution, the South engaged on two parallel, somewhat contradictory strategies.  On the One hand, it advocated a form of a weak Union, unable to coerce its will on States.  One the other hand, the South used the lesser unity of the Northern states to form Southern dominated bi-sectional parties - both the Jeffersonian Republicans and later the Democrats in the 1840s and 50s - which led the South to be the dominating section in the union.<br />After secession, the Confederate constitution formed was very similar to the US one, although it reflected the South's commitment to Slavery, and its distrust of Politics.  So similar was the Southern legal framework to the Federal one, that Confederate prosecutors, judges and juries continued legal proceedings from before secession, as if it has never occurred.<br />In an interesting and perceptive introduction. Fehrenbacher notices that all Post-CW histories of the South are also histories of secession.  Although brief, this, like all of Fehrenbacher's writings, is a significant contribution to the effort to understand the roots of the American Civil War.	2003-10-17
US	51630889	R2BRJVL1DF1BGK	0345461924	846543535	Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East	Books	5	6	9	N	Y	In the Middle East, all politics is global politics	Michael Oren has written a captivating account of the diplomatic, political, and biographical circumstances around the war the Israelis call 'The Six Day War' and the Arabs know as 'The June War'.  As the glowing reviews, on Amazon.Com and elsewhere suggest, this is a captivating, well researched book, that will almost certainly be known as a classic. <br />After an introduction which traces the Israeli-Arab conflict to the 1960s, Oren starts unrolling the events that lead to the outbreak of the war - namely, the boarder clashes between Israel and Syria, the attacks by Palestinian Militants (or terrorists, or revolutionaries, take your pick), and the counter attacks (or raids, or Imperialistic demonstrations of power) by Israelis.<br />The crisis took an escalation with the evacuation of the United Nation Emergency Force from Egypt, thus closing Israel's red sea port, and the movement of Egyptian forces into the Sinai desert.  <br />Oren's description of the political forces at work, going back and force from Jerusalem, Cairo, Damascus, Moscow and Washington DC (with stops at Amman, Paris and the UN headquarters in New York City), is nothing short of masterful.  He describes how internal power struggles within the Arab world and within Egypt moved Egypt towards a confrontation with Israel and the Unites States, and how political forces within Israel, as well as a wish to maintain close relationships with the US ruled Israeli political movements.<br />I was struck by the major role U Thant, the Secretary General of the United Nations played in the conflict.  By pulling the UN forces from the straits of Tiran that rapidly, Thant boosted Egyptian's pride.  Had Thant stood up to Nasser, perhaps the war could have been evaded.<br />Equally interesting is Oren's depiction of US President Johnson, heavily involved in the much criticized war in Vietnam, unable to give Israel the support that it asked for - and thus, in the eyes of the Israeli leadership, giving it the greenlight to strike.<br />The attack, launched by Israeli airforce on the 5th of June 1967, caught the Egyptian unaware.  Israeli operation Focus, the destruction of Egyptian air fields, was a resounding success.  In a way, the war was already won.<br />The greatest weakness of Oren's account is in the description of the military operation.  Frankly, they were so confused, with hardly any maps, that I don't think you can understand much about the ground level events of the war, or about the military strategy at all the levels except the highest, unless you already know a great deal about it beforehand.<br />This fault, however, does not really mar this otherwise excellent account, which goes on to describe the mix of responses in the Arab world, both desperation and euphoria (due to the phantasmagorial propaganda), the accusations that the US aided Israel (what Johnson called 'The Big Lie'), and the unfortunate attack on the USS Liberty by Israeli forces (Which Oren convincingly demonstrates was an accident).<br />Most interesting, Oren describes the attempt to secure a cease-fire, and Israel's attempts to duck, delay and win time.  After trying hard to avoid the war, Israeli leaders were unwilling to end it without a major change in the political landscape - the conquest of vast territories in the Sinai desert, the West Bank, and the Goal Heights.  <br />I was also amazed to read about the complete lack of strategic planning in the side of Israel.  While military plans were finely drawn and perfectly executed, there was apparently no thought at all given to the goals of the war, beyond a somewhat naive wish to expand Israel's boarders and repay the Arab aggressors.  Decisions such as weather to conquer East Jerusalem, to cross the tunnel, or to invade Syria, were done on the spur on the moment.  Worse, they were often carried out not by the Government, but by the whims of Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan.<br />This is perhaps the most extraordinary revelation I had while reading Oren's book - that Dayan, and virtually Dayan alone, decided almost all the important decisions of the war.  Not Prime Minister Eshkol, not the Israeli government, and not the international community made the decisions.  For better or worse, almost everything in the modern Middle East is the consequence of the solitary decisions of Moshe Dayan.  <br />Almost four decades later, in the middle of yet another wave of Israeli-Arab violence, I find that highly troubling, but strangely Ironic, and I fear that, in this regard at least, little has changed.  In the event of an all out war, will the next forty or fifty years be decided by one charismatic leader in the Israeli cabinet?	2003-08-29
US	51630889	R3V8RQJ1EAXTM7	0801486815	577688282	Germany's War and the Holocaust: Disputed Histories	Books	3	21	23	N	Y	Interesting Essays in German Historiography	\\"Germany's War and the Holocaust\\" is a collection of essays about History and Historiography, action and representation, facts and biases in the history of the German war machine and its savage behavior.<br />The underlying theme throughout all the essays is the 'Functionalist' versus the 'Intentionalist' schools of thought regarding the Holocaust.  The 'Functionalist' (generally German, traditional and right wing, although there are many notable exceptions such as Hannah Ardent) sees the Holocaust as a consequence of inter-German politics, of the escalation of violence in Totalitarian regimes, and of beaurecrats following orders.  The 'Internationalist' school (often Jewish, left wing in the German context - although serving multiple political purposes abroad) focuses on the effect of anti-Semitism both among the Germans, the nations cooperating with the Germans (mostly in East Europe and Russia), and the Nazi leadership.<br />Bartov puts himself is the moderate Intentionalist camp, recognizing that the Holocaust was created as part of the German social, political and military policies, but also sees racist ideology as important.  Indeed, Bartov's objection to monocasual explanation is commendable.<br />Most of the book is evaluation of different works published in the field recently.  The level of the articles (and the quality of the prose) was unequal, from the very good to the damn near unreadable.<br />Among the worst, is the final essay 'Germans as Jews' a nearly incoherent discussion of the roles of Jews in German post war representations.  On the other hand, discussions of Blitzkrieg and of Gotz Aly's thesis that the holocaust was the only part the Nazis managed to excecute from a much grander policy to completely change the racial nature of the Europe, are very interesting.<br />Much of the book is a discussion of Daniel Goldhagen's now infamous \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans the Holocaust\\".  Bartov's critique of the book is interesting but hardly unique, as Bartov more or less follows the standard historian's consensus of valuing the refocus on anti-Semitism as a cause for the holocaust, and of interesting reports on some lesser known aspects of the holocaust, while rejecting the overall thesis as far too sweeping.<br />A full chapter on the public controversy regarding the publication of Goldhagen's book is interesting but shallow.  There are better studies of the perception of the Holocaust in some countries, which present a much more nuanced view - among them Peter Novick's wonderful \\"The Holocaust in American Life\\" and Tom Segev's \\"The Seventh Million: Israelis and the Holocaust\\".<br />My favorite essay was the one about Victor Klemperer's diary \\"I will bear witness\\".  Bartov describes Victor Klemperer, a middle aged academic and a German patriot, who finds that Germany abandons him.  Strangely, instead of feeling hatred and alienation from Germany, Klemperer sees himself as virtually the last German, the only preserver of German values and ethics, and most of all a cultural tradition that the Germans abandoned, and that he, the Jew, had to keep for them.	2003-08-23
US	51630889	R2QWZZHQZI21S5	0805071474	234644233	The Triumph of Evolution: and the Failure of Creationism	Books	3	7	10	N	Y	There is a war	Having read, reviewed and thoroughly enjoyed Niles Eldredge's 'Reinventing Darwin', I was looking forward to his account of the creationism controversy.  Although an interesting read, I found unfocused and disappointing.<br />Much of the problem is that Eldredge writes what are in essence several different books.  We have discussions of the Scientific Method, primers on evolution, the fossil record, patterns of life and punctuated equilibrium, attacks on young earth creationism, and a reply to Intelligent Design Creationism.  All this in a framework (expressed in the introduction and the concluding chapter) claiming that religion, along with science, can solve the great challenge that lays ahead of us - the ecological crises and the threat to biodiversity.<br />Unfortunately, there are much better essays on each of these issues, and that the strength of Eldredge's arguments vary considerably between these issues.<br />After an interesting introduction, Eldredge treats us with a sound but all too brief discussion on scientific methodology. Eldredge explains how in science, we have a hierarchy of ideas - some extremely well established (like the 'fact' that the Earth is round and that life evolved) and some more speculative (like the superstring theory or the age of the universe).  Thus the creationist regular chant that evolution is 'just a theory' is meaningless.<br />It is a good discussion, but more sophisticated accounts exist.  My personal favorite is chapter four of Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont's Intellectual Impostures ('Fashionable Nonsense' in the American edition).<br />Chapter three 'The Fossil Record' is probably the dullest chapter in the book.  There is very little wrong with the discussion of the evolution of life in it - although it maybe stresses the ideas of Eldredgess 'Naturalist' school a little too much - but it is not very coherent.  Eldredge simply is not the master of prose that Gould and Dawkins are.<br />Chapter four, which deals with Natural selection and punctuated Equilibrium is much better, in part because of its lovely history of evolutionary thought structure, and in part due to the eloquent 'Naturalist' account of evolutionary theory - with all the stress on Punctuated Equilibrium you would expect from its co-creator.<br />Chapter five is an attack on Young Earth Creationism.  It deals mostly with Geology, and is both competent and unexceptional.<br />In Chapter Six, Eldredge argues that Creationists are often dishonest, and takes on the Intelligent Design movement headed by Phillip Johnson.  For the most part he does a good job.  Nonetheless, better criticism of Johnson's concept of 'atheistic materialism' appear in Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism by Robert T. Pennock.  The critique of Michel Behes irreducible complexity, while true, is far from thorough (the best review on Behe is an on line article in the Boston Review Intelligent Design, Again by H. Allen Orr).<br />Furthermore, on this chapter and on the next one, Eldredge bends over backwards to please the religious, especially Christians.  The matter here is the association between evolution and atheism.  While anti-evolutionists wish to equate evolution with atheism, biologists like Gould and Eldredge sometimes fall into the opposite trap  pretending that there is no discord between evolution and religion.  Actually, while evolution does not disprove Christianity (or religion in general), it certainly poses a challenge to Christianity which Christian apologetics should face if they wish to persuade us that Christianity is true or at least intellectually acceptable.<br />The tendency grows worse.  In chapter seven, Eldredge falls deeper into the bending over trap.  Eldredge claims that he sees a great role for religion in the future  religion is mankinds tool to fight off the coming ecological crisis.<br />Eldredge thinks that religion mirrors ecology  religious traditions, especially as embodied in concepts of God, are deeply if not wholly ecological concepts as well (p. 162).  He demonstrates this by an argument so thin  using only two examples, one of them from the King James Bible and one from an African tribe  that it barely requires refutation.  What is the religious response for the current crisis ? the emergence of the economic impact of humanity on the biosphere as a whole is so new that it is perhaps to be expected that no religious traditions independently mirroring the relatively recent scientific understanding of the problem have yet emerged in other words, even if you were to accept the  extremely metaphorical  connection between religion and the ecological niche mankind posses, the connection is obsolete.  Nonetheless, there is hope.  Eldredge observes a growing movement in conservative Christian circles, a movement that can only be described as green (p.167)<br />Now this is patently irrelevant.  As much as the leftist and secular environmentalists may applaud that our religious brethren are finally opening their eyes to a danger that has been known since the 1970s, what does that have to do with their religion?  If the religious wants to join the good fight, they are welcome to it, but it doesnt make the struggle for biodiversity religious.<br />Eldredge has redefined religion in such a way as to make it unrecognizable.  The problem of religion will not go away so easily.  Eldredge simply refuses to except that the existence or inexistence of God is an empirical question  and he hides the differences between science and religion with obfuscationist rhetoric.  Eldredge dares say that on the one hand we created God in our own image but that does not say that the concept of God in question does not exist in precisely the manner Christian theology specifies (p. 166 note 12).  Of course not  but no one can take seriously the idea that we invented God in our own image and somehow miraculously captured the way God really is like.<br />Eldredge claims to respect all religions, but if religion is false it does not deserve respect.  Rather, like any other false idea, it should be discarded, and whatever social role it plays must be taken over by an institution based on truth, not myth.s, especially as embodied in concepts of God, are deeply if not wholly ecological concepts as well (p. 162).

A high tech McGavin from a defeated enemy, and undercover heroes going after it.  Add to this a coming-of-age story and a whole group of opposing factions (in the climax, there are three AI groups and 5 human groups alternatively cooperating and struggling), and you've got all the elements for a good planet based Space Opera.<br />But Although 'Ventus' is not a classic like Dan Simmons's Hyperion Cantos and the 'Deepness' books by Vernor Vinge (an obvious inspiration for Schroeder - and why not learn from the best?) it manages to be more than just another good SF tale.<br />One element that works well is the focus on nano-technology.  Yeah, Nano is the early 21st century equivalent to Atomic power in the 1940s - it's the technology everyone in the present (and thus also in the future) is obsessed with.  And yet Schroeder manages to do some very interesting things with Nano, including the cool idea of 'Winds' working together to terraform a planet, and some interesting musings about how nano may be used to resurrect the Platonian notion of 'the essence' of things.<br />Also good are the characters, particularly Generals Armigar and Levin.  The former, a god learning to be human, is portrayed realistically, and the predictable love interest is nonetheless effective.  Some spooky scenes in which he eats wood and stones are cool, too.<br />Levin, conflicted between love and duty, is also a very sympathetic and tragic character, and his scenes are the most effective in the novel.<br />Although the pace is a little slow, the writing is effective and sometimes inspired, and Ventus is an enjoyable novel of action and ideas.	2003-07-24

One of the first books about the US Civil War I've read was Don Fehrenbacher's The Dred Scot Case.  That book, among my favourite all time history books, made it all but certain that I would eventually seek more of his works.<br />In 'The Slaveholding Republic', Fehrenbacher returns to themes very similar to the ones examined in 'Dred Scot'.  Both books are about how the experiment in freedom established by the American Founding Fathers dealt with the paradox pointed out by Samuel Johnson \\"how is it that the greatest yelp for liberty come from the drivers of nigros?\\"<br />'Dred Scot' focused on two main themes - the status of slaves (and free blacks) in the law, and the legal/political questions of the power to abolish and establish slavery.<br />'The Slaveholding Republic' deals with these themes, but presents a broader picture.  In the first chapter, Fehernbacher deals with the constitution's attitude to slavery.  Fehernbacher is clearly upset about attacks on the constitution as a pro-slavery tool, and he makes a convincing case that the constitution neither supported nor condemned slavery, and that if anything, the very wording (avoiding the word 'slave' entirely) shows unease with slavery.<br />The second chapter deals with slavery in Washington DC.  Until the 1830s, slavery in the capital was only a minor political issue.  With the rise of Garrisonian abolitionism, attacks on slavery in the capital started to increase, but until the civil war, the only achievement reached was the barring of the slave trade in it.<br />Whatever debate was running within the US about slavery, to the world, the US was unquestionably a slave holding republic, constantly trying to defend pro slavery interests, especially in compensating slave holders for slave carried away.  Even people with anti-Slavory convictions such as John Qunicy Adams treated slaves as property for those purposes.<br />Two chapters deal with the Slave trade.  In it, Fehrenbacher diffrentiates between importation of slaves to the US, which was effectively surpressed, and the atlantic slave trade to Cuba and Brazil, in which Americans, because of the US's passive support, played a large roll up to the late 1850s.<br />The next two chapters are about the Fugitive Slave Laws.  In essence, those demonstrate a conflict between the clause in the constitution obliging the return of escaping slaves, to the defence of free slaves from kidnapping.  Until the 1830s, most clashes developed due to the Northern states trying to protect free blacks from kiddnapping.  But with time, these laws became obstructionists, preventing even the retension of fugitives.  As part of the 1850 compromise, a draconian fugitive slave law was enforced, crashing the rights of free blacks and raising strong objections from Northern abolitionists, especially in New England.<br />The two final chapters bring us to the outbreak of the civil war.  Fehrenbacher manages to sum the arguments he raises in 'Dred Scot', without making the reader feel he's returning to the same grounds.  Rather, the intepretations are striking.  I was especially interested with Stephen Dauglas's role in the session crises.  Twice in the 1850s, Dauglas's actions contributed to the dissolation of the union and the coming of the war.  In 1852, his ilcalculated move with the Kensas-Nebraska act harmed raised Southern expectations and alienated Northerners.  In 1857, the life long compromiser Dauglas suddenly became a man commited to the 'great principle' of popular sovreignty, breaking down the Democratic party as he did it.  Had Dauglas managed to come up with a compromise, he might have remained the head of the united democratic party  in the 1860 election, and after his defeat, he might have had enough influence to keep the South in the union.  Of course, the counter factual is fanciful, but it is nonetheless intriguing.<br />This chapter and the next were completed by Fehrenbacher's former student, historian Ward M. McAfee.  For the most part, McAfee does a commendable job, and writes good prose, which is very effective, even if it is not quite as elegant as Fehernbacher.  It would be interesting to know how much of the last two quarters McAfee completed.  My guess would be about one quarter of the first and half of the last.  McAfee, continues Fehrenbacher's thesis very well, and there are few if any discrenible slips in the argument.  However, McAfee has a tendency to moralise which I found slightly irritating.<br />The last chapter explains why the rise of the Republican party was such a threat to the South, despite Lincoln's repeat assurences that he meant no harm to slavery 'where it existed'.  Ultimately, slavery depended not only on the States right to control their own domestic institutions, but also on support from a pro-slavery federal government.  Lincoln's election meant that for the first time, the South was no longer representitive of America.  The slaveholding republic was no more, and slavery was on the route to extinction.  Slaveholders' attempt to recreate the Slaveholding republic was the source of sescession, and the Civil War that brought a fast ending to the the institution.<br />During the time of the American Revolution, slaveholder Thomas Jefferson, man of the enlightment, considered slavery to be a great evil.  As an older man, settled into Southern ways, he let his antislavery convictions deteriorate into mere rethorics.  Until Abraham Lincoln's election, the United States prefered to ignore Jefferson's words that \\"all men were created equal\\", and it was truly a Slaveholding republic.or the most part, McAfee does a commendable job, and writes good prose, which is very effective, even if it is not quite as elegant as Fehernbacher.

'Eleanor of Aquitaine' is the story of the 12th century French queen of both England and France.  Hers was an interesting life, and Marion Meade tells it quite well.  In a real Epic, Eleanor marries the kings of France and of England, goes on a crusade, gives birth to no less then 10 children, including Richard Lion Heart and King John.  She divorces one husband and participates in a  rebellion against the second.  She helps to of her sons reign as kings, and finally dies before watching the collapse of the empire she so desired.<br />The problem with Meade's narrative is that much of what she describes seems debatable.  As a previous reviewer noted, this seems as much fiction as fact.  hardly a page goes by without the words 'must have' appearing somewhere.  Much of the thoughts, plans, and ideas of Eleanor and other characters is pure speculation.  Worse yet, often some of the actions and whereabouts of characters are given based on extreme circumstantial evidence.<br />Meade is also trying to hard to model Eleanor into a modern style feminist.  Although she constantly attempts to depict Eleanor as an active, resourceful and wise woman, who rarely if ever makes mistakes, it is quite clear that Eleanor does not fit into that model.  In fact, I got the impression you could easily have written the story of Eleanor as an essentially passive bystander in the political dramas involving her parents, husbands and children.<br />The footnotes, by the way, are complete waste of time for anyone trying to distinguish fact and fiction in Meade's work, unless one is a scholar of the period.<br />Ultimately 'Eleanor of Aquitaine' is a very good read, but one suspects it is a poor history.	2003-06-24

It is a wide ranging survey, which, despite some guiding themes, often feels more like a collection of essays than a unified work.    There are, I think, several questions of great interest to the contemporary reader about Japan.  One would probably be most interested in learning about how Japan dealt with the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; how Japan turned from a racist, imperialist country into a democratic and pacifistic one; and how Japan not only recovered from the economic devastation of the war, but finally became one of the world's leading powers.    Strangely, Professor Dower seem to give peripheral attention at best to the first and third question, and pays most attention to the second, as well as to minuet study of the interactions between the US occupation force and the Japanese population.  He also focuses mostly on the early years of the occupation, up to 1949 or so, as if a chapter or two on the outbreak of the cold war were planned but later discarded.    Much of the book is 'social history' - a depiction not so much of the leading characters and figures, but of sociological and economic trends.  All too often, Dower fall into the trap of this kind of writing - describing things that, for any observer with the slightest knowledge of the society, would be patently obvious.  Who could fail to anticipate poverty and corruption in a country devastated by war?  Given the existence of rationing, every one who ever took any economic course can predict the appearance of a black market.  And obviously, a country that lost millions of its young population in war would pay more attention to its own casualties than to those of the former enemies.    One of the great advantages of social history is that it lends itself to quantitative, statistical analysis.  Surprisingly, Dower hardly ever mentions public polls, and rarely attempts to quantify his observations about opinions as expressed in media articles.  His use of economic statistics is only somewhat better.  There is an old historian's maxim which goes \\"don't guess, try to count, and if you can't count, admit that you're guessing\\".  Unfortunately, Dower fails to conform.  I think that his analysis is robbed of much of its power because of this.     The central theme of the book is the paradoxes of 'Democracy from Above' - the US enforced an authoritarian rule to make people free.  It is' of course an interesting paradox, but Dower's exploration of it is only as good as the specific topics in which he engages.    By far the best part of the book deals with American 'wedge strategy', the attempt to distinguish between the Emperor and the military government headed by Tojo.  Most of part 4, dealing with the wedge strategy and the formation of the Japanese constitution are nothing short of breathtaking, as they explore the intrigue and politics of occupied Japan, and of Japan vis a vis the United States and the world.  The image of McArthur, strangely aloof from Japanese culture, and yet also admired and dedicated for change, is an intriguing and well realized one.    Also interesting is Dower's report on (and especially criticism of) the War Crime trials.  Although I was left unconvinced that the Japanese would have done a better job judging the war criminals themselves, it is a powerful demonstration of the great problematic nature of international law, which is in essence, as Dower calls it, Victor's Justice.    Ultimately, though, it is hard to see a clear plan in the book, and Dower's afterward, in which he attempts to pull everything together, feels shallow (but interesting).  In it he for the first time engages fully the economic leap forward Japan took in the 1960s.  Dower argues that the key to Japan's industrialization lies in the '15 years war', starting with the commencement of hostilities with China in 1931.  Japan in the second half of the twentieth century, having renounced its militarism, came to excel in the other field open to it - economics.    For people who, like me, are trying to understand how Japan became the leading economic power it is today and how other countries could learn from its example. Dower's book supplies no answer.  Its failures of narrative prevent it, in my opinion, from reaching the status of a classic.  Yet for all its faults, Embracing Defeat is an interesting, informative and readable study of Japan after the war.	2003-06-07
US	51630889	R3GV6U44Q7WBKY	0879751983	281452341	Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions	Books	3	15	30	N	Y	The Edge of Reason	Or, how to battle the irrational and irrelevant.    Flim Flam! is a fairly straightforward narrative.  There is a lot of nonsense in the world, and our fearless hero, James 'The Amazing' Randi, is out to expose it.    One has to ask, who exactly is the audience for this book?  For skeptics such as myself, the conclusion is obvious - quacks and cheats and self-delusioned people claim that they can perform paranormal acts, but they are either lying or mistaken.  For the believers, this is a book that is at best irrelevant (\\"Just because a, b and c can't really heal with their touch, it doesn't mean that d can't\\"), or at worst fraudulent (\\"Randi won't admit the truth\\" or, as one person tell asks him \\"Why did you do this, Mr. Randi?  don't you believe in God?\\" p. 284) So hardly anyone can expect to come out of this book with their views radically changed.    The only real target for this book would presumably be young adults and people who have yet undecided.  But frankly, I think people who want to make up their mind as to the truth of the paranormal or the value of skepticism, would be much better off reading a book like Carl Sagan's [[ASIN:0345409469 The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]], which deals with a wider areas of subjects very effectively (from personal experience, I can say that having read 'The Demon Haunted World' at age 17, I was deeply influenced, and many of my present views can be traced back to that book, which is a -flawed - masterpiece).      Randi himself does not think his book is useless, obviously.  Quite the contrary, he writes lengthily about Jim Jones and about expensive miracle cures which don't work.  If the point is that rationality is good, then he's obviously correct.  But Randi can hardly change human nature, and as he himself testifies, few of the people he exposes learn and amend their ways.    True, some forms of stupidity deserve to be tarnished, and when talk show interviews a self proclaimed 'Medium' it wouldbe a good idea to have a skeptic around as well.  But Randi's subjects have, mercifully, not aged well, and as consequence, neither has his critique of them.  Uri Geller nowadays is all but forgotten, and skeptics who would not give him undue publicity best ignore him.  'Transcendental Meditation', which apparently was very popular in the 70s, is even less remembered now.  (A much better discussion of TM - alas within a problematic analytic framework - appears in [[ASIN:0520057317 The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival and Cult Formation]]by Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge).    Those are the major offenders in Randi's book.  For the most part, the rest are even more obscure (although Eric von Daniken might be somewhat better known).  You've got a whole bunch of spoon twisters, leg pullers, faith healers and card tricksters, all or almost all of them must be well into retirement by now.    One must wonder why does Randi pursue all these quarks?  How appropriate is it for a grown man to expose a man who - I kid you not - believe he can 'mummify' fruits and meat with his own hands? (p. 296) At some point, Randi and company actually build and underground pipe system in order to expose 'dowsers' (people who can detect underground water).  It must have cost a small fortune.  Shouldn't some people be left over for the mental health authorities instead of the stage magicians?  Especially considering how harmless most of them are.    Ultimately, since I concluded the book is of very little importance, you are only left wondering, how well written and entertaining it is.  And in this front, Randi for the most part delivers.  His humorous, sarcastic tone, fits the subject matter entirely.  With chapter headings such as 'The Giggling Guru: A matter of Levity', you can expect fun reading, with occasional hilarious highlights.  My favorite case was a scientist, who, instead of using random numbers for a test of a psychic's abilities, put in numbers of his own choosing.  When this was discovered, a colleague put on an interpretation saying that this was because of the scientists own ability to know the future \\"the explanation would require that [the scientist] used precognition when inserting digits into the [random] columns of numbers he was copying down, unconsciously choosing numbers that would score hits on the calls the subject would later make\\" (p. 234).      In brief: fun and not too deep.  An educational 'flight' book, if you will.	2003-06-01
US	51630889	R3N7ABAB4IHEB	0345384687	858634254	The Guns of the South	Books	2	8	15	N	N	God and AK 47s	I first read 'The Guns of the South' about two years ago, following recommendations that it was Harry Turtledove's best book. The idea (and the cover featuring Lee with the AK 47) - was intriguing enough. Someone from the future supplies the Confederated with advanced weapons - but who and why, and what will the South do with these weapons?    The beginning was promising. The opening chapter, I am the first to admit, is nothing short of magnificent. With effective, although not always pretty, prose, Turtledove describes Lee's wonder at the arrival of the new weapons, and the feeling of great changes to come.     Unfortunately, from that moment on, the book starts to disappoint. First, it introduces Nate Caudell, a 'simple' soldier, who is supposed to give us the view from the Trenches. His chapters, interwoven with those focusing on Lee, are always inferior in interest than the Lee chapters. Lee, the real and the imaginary, is much more interesting than the sergeant.    Furthermore, the prose is not particularly appealing. In an attempt to catch the feeling of the time, Turtledove has Lee saying things like (in a single, completely typical paragraph) \\"I do indeed, Colonel\\" and \\"May I please have a pen and a scrap of paper\\". If you read some of Lee's letters, you get a man who was not such a parody of the Southern Gentleman.    Those are minor faults. There are two real problems with the book, which make it, ultimately, a failure, although one that can have an appeal for fans of military fiction.    The first is the overall type of the book. As a time travel story, 'The Guns of the South' should be a science fiction tale. It could have been a high concept story, in which forces from the future play like Gods in Victorian America, and the locals try to adapt. At the very least, some considerations of the logic behind the time traveller's actions should be considered. Why do South African white supremacist want to control the CSA? And if they have detailed plans to itsfuture (as they do), why give the locals the weapons that will allow them independent action? Predictably, Lee's soldiers use the South African's weapons against them. As none of these issues get even the least bit of consideration, the AWB people remain as the Deus Ex Machina source for no less than one hundred thousand AK-47s, and as the over top racist villains. (As another reviewer wonders, does Turtledove really suggest that the Apartheid was worse than African Slavery? or that American slaveholders were more moral than AWB aristocrats?)    But in truth, Turtledove is not interested in all these things. The AK-47 serve merely as a gimmick (and, may I be cynical enough to suggest, a promotion) in his alternative civil war. Unlike the 'World War' series, which at least acknowledged the great changes that a superior force would bring to the world of the 1940s, here Turtledove merely wishes to speculate about what would have been the outcome of the US Civil War, had the 'War of Northern Aggression' ended differently.    Unfortunately, for all Turtledove's familiarity of the minuet details of regiments in the Army of Northern Virginia, he seems strangely incomprehensive as to the broader picture of the South in antebellum America. Even when I read the book for the first time, knowing nothing about the US Civil War, I found the premise Turtledove promoted extremely far-fetched. Now, when I am somewhat of a Civil War buff, the glaring improbability of the scenario shouts out from the pages.    In short, Turtledove fancies (there really is no better word), a liberal Confederacy, led by the abolitionist Robert E. Lee, which immidiately puts together a movement of gradual emancipation.    This is highly unlikely. For start, the Southern way of life and economy were intimately linked with Slavery, the degree that abolition would have completely changed the fabric of society. Throughout the Civil War, the price of slaves actually rose and over the rapid inflation. Not only were plantation life intimately linked with the 'peculiar institution', but one of the upper South most important exports was slaves for the South.    Furthermore, as late as April 1865, when the South finally organized black battalions, Jefferson Davis could not get congress to emancipate even the black soldiers, let alone their families or the entire black population of the South. This was despite the obvious military necessity, and the endorsement of both Davis and Lee.    Had the confederacy won the war, they would have most certainly seen their way of life vindicated by God. The miraculous arrival of the weapons certainly would have encouraged them to stick to their ways.    Nor does Turtledove pay any attention to the State Rights philosophy. Before the war, not even the abolitionists believed that they has a constitutional right to abolish slavery in the states, and indeed some considered the constitution to be an agent of slavery. In the South, the wildly held Calhoun doctrine claimed that Congress did not even have the right to abolish slavery in the territories. If anything, the Confederate constitution was even more pro-State rights and slavery than the US constitution. The idea that central government in the South would do what even the black republican could not is pure fantasy.    The sheer quantity of positive reviews is an indication that this book has great appeal to some people. Why the preeminent US Civil War historian, James McPherson 'could not put THE GUNS OF THE SOUTH down' is a complete mystery to me. If you are looking for a good Science Fiction book, or for a good alternative history of the Civil War, look elsewhere.	2003-05-26
US	51630889	R19IABRNNSF8FK	0670030023	445205425	Breaking Faith: THE POPE, THE PEOPLE, AND THE FATE OF CATHOLICISM	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Opinionated guide to the played out paradox	'Breaking Faith' is John Cornwell's essay about the Church being torn out between two contradictory movements.  On the one hand, exclusivity - the belief that Church is the infallible and only way to salvation, and that its teaching are God's truth, and thus objectively correct. On the other hand, the Pluralism of the Western world, where secularism and respect for other beliefs are consistently preached, though inconsistently practiced.    Cornwell does not hide his views - he is a Liberal, and this book is written from a Liberal perspective.  But the bias is easy enough to overcome, as the issues are the same for both conservatives and liberals.      In a short, easy to read and Journalistic book (unfortunately lacking the substantial scholarship of Cornwell's better known [[ASIN:014311400X Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII]]), Cornwell presents some main areas of conflict in the Church - including the issues of homosexuality, the truth of other religions, papal infallibility and the making of saints.  In each, essentially the same battle is fought - between the pluralists and the conservatives.    The subtitle of the book I hold in my hand is 'Can the Catholic Church Save itself?'  The answer if obviously yes - the Roman Catholic Church is the oldest institution of mankind.  It has survived the fall of an Empire, the disappearance and reappearance of science, immense corruption, the Reformation, and the Enlightenment.  It has survived loss of Earthly power and two world wars, the rise of Nationalism, Fascism, Communism and Capitalism.  It will survive this age and its problems as well.    The question is, what will it do to survive, and where will it survive.  Cronwell believes that the Church should open up, be more pluralistic, inclusionist and down to earth.  He believes it must change.    Personally, I think he is wrong.  If the Church will surrender the mysticism and exclusionism it currently practice, it will lose much of its power over its believers.  Like reform Jews, relaxed Catholics will merge into the general Judeo-Christianity of the Western world.  The pluralists are lost to the Church on any event - it is the core believers who will remain with the Church in the future.  The Fundamentalists and conservatives are the basis, the 'loyal consumers' of the Church, if you will, and it is them it must guard.  The growth of the Church must inevitably take place in the less pluralistic parts of the world - the third world.  There, the zeitgeist is probably more suitable for an exclusionist Church then in the Western world.    One interesting question, that Cornwell fails to explore, is whether there will develop an official movement, whose members will consider themselves Catholics but refuse to follow dictates from Rome.  In an unorganized fashion, this is true already, witness the case of 'Dogma' director, Kevin Smith.  Smith's movie is critical of basic Catholic themes and ideas, and would certainly not be sanctioned by the conservative official Church.  But Smith considers himself Catholic nonetheless.  Will we see churches which will carry out things the official Church does not approve (like ordaining women priests), and yet still regard themselves as Catholic?  And how will the Church react to such churches?  Certainly, if there will only be a small number of such churches, the Vatican will ex-communicate them.  But how will the Papacy react to a large movement of self proclaimed Catholics who disregard official Catholic preaching?    Another interesting question is the high human cost of the Church's principled conservative stand.  How many people suffer from AIDS because the Church refuses to sanction condom in Africa?  How many people in the West suffer from the much tamer problems of the conflict between their Church and their society?  And, perhaps most importantly, can the Church, while maintaining the general hard line, find a way to reach out for these people and elevate their misery?    Youwill find no answers to these questions in this book.  Ultimately, those are questions for Catholics to figure out, while outsiders such as myself watch with great interest.  Frankly, I am not quite sure what outcome I prefer, but I learned much from this book and, whether conservative of liberal or not even Catholic, I think you will too.	2003-04-27
US	51630889	R3TAGB0M5E1X95	0471303011	425937674	Reinventing Darwin: The Great Debate at the High Table of Evolutionary Theory	Books	5	9	12	N	N	A View from the Trenches	In 'Reinventing Darwin', Niles Eldredge presents the view of a different side of the issues presented by what he calls 'Ultra-Darwinists', the likes of Richard Dawkins and Maynard Smith.  As such, it raises an important contribution to our understanding of natural history, and is essential for anyone interested in current debates inside of Neodarwinism.<br />Perhaps the most striking thing about 'Reinventing Darwin', is how little attention Eldredge pays to the design of actual animal bodies and behaviors.  Richard Dawkins's books, for example, are filled with explanation of various complex and semi-designed things - such as altruism in 'The Selfish Gene'.  'The Blind Watchmaker' is entirely devoted to the question of how things like wings, eyes and legs are formed by natural selection.<br />Eldredge, on the other hand, is hardly ever interested in these issues.  He does make a halfhearted attack on the 'Panglossian' kind, which is associated with Gould, but Eldredge had little to do with the paper about the Arches of San Marino.  Eldredge readily concedes that the great majority of animal features are formed by natural selection (p.48).<br />So what is the focus of Eldredge book, and the main line of critique of the Ultra-Darwinists?  The answer is the larger patterns of natural history.  Eldredge believes that the history of life is not just the principles of natural selection extrapolated.  Rather, Eldredge believes that in the large scale, there are different principles that govern life, additions to simple natural selection.<br />Eldredge is most convincing when he discusses the importance of species as players in evolution.  Eldredge points out that within species, different groups ('demes') can evolve differences from the main group, but that species are normally one reproductive entity, and that thus small differences get merged back into the species average.  Thus only when a distinct reproductive body is formed (usually by geographical separation from themain group), evolution can create a new species.  <br />This form of higher level evolution seems logical and natural.  However, Eldredge arguments about higher level selection (species selection) is not very clear, convincing, or forcefully argued.  The best of what Eldredge does promote is Elizabeth Vrba's theory, that species often exist in a more general archetype and in unique, specialized species.  Vrba found out that there is a higher level of specification from those specialized species than the more general group.  Eldredge argues that this is because the more specialized species, when moving to a different environment, face stronger evolutionary pressure.  This he called 'Species Sorting', and this (as opposed to the argument that there is competition between various animal species and Taxas), I find easy to accept.  I do wish that Eldredge would elaborate on empirical ways to verify his conclusion.  Indeed, the book as a whole could benefit from more attention to how the differences between Ultra-Darwinists and Naturalists can be tested empirically.  <br />Finally, Eldredge turns his attention to ecosystem and to Richard Dawkins concept of selfish genes.  Eldredge argues that Ultra-Darwinists have turned natural selection from a passive to an active player.  In Dawkins's scheme, natural selection shapes gene so that they will influence the environment. So that there are genes 'for' beaver dams and for reading.  Eldredge puts against this a model in which the environment effects the genes via natural selection, and the genes effect the environment via the organism.<br />To me, this a distinction without a difference, although Eldredge thinks that it betrays a great conceptual failure of Ultra-Darwinism.  He tries to illustrate this with the example of human sociobiology.  Eldredge does prove that the selfish gene perspective is not enough to explain human behavior, but this is beside the point.  Eldredge readily concedes that few Ultra-Darwinists are hardcore genetic determinists (p.212).  How is that possible?  Because, as Dawkins discusses in 'The Selfish Gene' and elsewhere, humans, alone from all animals, have culture.  Thus, if Eldredge wishes to attack the 'Selfish Gene' theory, he should pick a different target. <br />I have not, perhaps, been as kind to this book in this review as I meant to be.  Whether or not I agree with specific conclusions by Eldredge, this remains a well written, well argued, and fascinating book.	2003-04-22
US	51630889	R12JCLG6AUVDOT	0195076060	245616651	Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution	Books	4	47	51	N	Y	Great Analysis, Poor Editing	James McPherson is not only the preeminent Historian of the US Civil War, but one of the greatest historians working today. He offers razor sharp analysis of complicated issues, with fair consideration of all points of view. Best of all, McPherson does all that in clear, concise and at times poetic language, that is remarkably easy to read.<br />'Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution' enjoys all the benefits of McPherson's considerable scholarship. Its problems are almost exclusively editorial.<br />This thin volume (152 pages of text; 20 more pages for notes, bibliography and an index) contains seven essays about the two themes in the title - The US Civil war seen as the second American Revolution, and Abraham Lincoln's role in it.<br />The first essay argues convincingly that the Civil War did radically change the Unites States. From a Slaveholding Republic, it became a free one. Politically, the center of gravity moved from the South to the north. Economically, the Industrial revolution, earlier contained in New England, spread out and defeated the plantation economy. In the South, the prevailing order was weakened, although not surmounted, and the situation of Blacks improved considerably, although equality was still very far. The theme McPherson is most interested in, however, is the change from a philosophy of negative liberty - freedom from government oppression - to one of positive liberty - the right for protection - guaranteed by the Federal government.<br />The second essay discusses Lincoln's role as the leader of the revolution. Lincoln, McPherson argues, was a pragmatic revolutionary. The revolution, which he brought on America, was caused by Lincoln's accurate assessment of necessities, not by a strong ideological tie to the revolution. Lincoln was no Lenin - he held sternly to the one principle of democracy, and the second American Revolution happened as a by-product of defending this principle.<br />In the third essay, 'Lincoln and Liberty', McPherson discusses how Lincoln's struggle for positive liberty was seen as despotic by those holding the principles of negative liberty. The Republicans wanted to restrict and ultimately destroy the rights of Southerners to hold slaves - and to enforce these restrictions by government action, if that was what it took.<br />Lincoln's role as supreme military commander is a neglected issue in Civil War historiography, claims McPherson, and he sets out to remedy that in the following essay. Lincoln's most important contribution, he concludes, was his unyielding hold on the doctrine of Unconditional Surrender. This issue also returns in Essay number 6, which compares Lincoln to Northerners who were not nearly as clear about the goal of fighting as he was.<br />Lincoln's rhetoric and the use of metaphors is the subject of the fifth essay. In an interesting comparison with Jefferson Davis, McPherson concludes that Lincoln's usage of metaphors in writing and speaking made him a superb communicator, which Davis wasn't. Thus, McPherson agrees with David Potter that had Lincoln been the leader of the South in the war, the confederacy might have maintained its independence.<br />One weakness of the collection is the lack of coherence in topics. The illuminating comparison between Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln in this essay, for example, is sadly missing from other chapters. Take War Leadership -Lincoln's grasp of the northern grand strategy made him replace popular generals who nonetheless could not follow his concept of total war. Jeff Davis on the other hand, despite his superior military background (as a war hero and a West-Point graduate), never articulated war aims as Lincoln did, and the Confederate war policy was constructed de facto by the decision of its irregularly brilliant generals. Lincoln would have made much better use of Robert E. Lee than Davis did. <br />The absence of such themes concurring through the book weakens the narrative, and it remainsmore an anthology than a focused monograph. Another such problem is the repetition between the essays. The final essay repeats almost all of the discussion about Isaiah Berlin's concepts of positive and negative liberty, before launching into the new theme. That theme, the turning away from positive liberty back to negative liberty during reconstruction, is fascinating. During reconstruction, Republicans had to constantly use the military in order to enforce equality for blacks on the unwilling Southrons. The disillusionment from Reconstruction and the resurrected fear from governmental tyranny left the racist policies of the South for another century, when Martin Luther King finished that job that Abraham Lincoln has began.	2003-03-19
US	51630889	R19DO5JY9R55M2	0393318885	27174518	The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor	Books	4	206	232	N	Y	The Big Question	You and I are part of a fortunate minority. We are literate, we have access to phones and to the Internet, we are likely (save some unexpected disease or misfortune) to live to an old age. We are almost certainly belonging to what is known as 'The First World', or to small rich minorities within the rest of the world. Most people in this world do not have those privileges - we live in islands of fortune within an ocean of poverty. And professor Landes tries to understand why.  He tries to find out what is special about Western civilization (and Japan) - why Japan and the West got rich while the rest of the world lagged behind, and most of it still does.<br />It is by the nature of such a book to be controversial, and Landes doesn't pull his punches; his approach is neoclassicist, although hardly a dogmatic one. He is rough on Postmodernists, Saidian Anti-Orientalists, French and Japanese protectionists, Spanish Roman Catholics, and many others. Among the reviews you'll read here, Landes irritates Catholics, third world enthusiasts, anti-Western intellectuals, extreme right wind Capitalists, anti-Japanese, and so on, and so on.<br />So, you've got controversy. But what is Landes actually saying? Well, in brief, Landes book focuses on three major reasons for Wealth/Poverty: Geography, Infrastructure, and Culture.<br />The discussion of Geography, early in the book, is at best half hearted. Some of the points seem valid - but you're always inclined to say 'On the other hand'. Are there really fewer diseases in Europe then in Africa? maybe, but transportation is easier. The black death annihilated a third of the European population in the 13th century. Does Heat makes labour harder and less efficient? I guess the builders of the Pyramids haven't heard Landes's thesis - or maybe hardships can be overcomming with whipping.<br />The best parts of the book deal with Infrastructure. In these, Landes has three main themes: Freedom, Capitalism and Science (Or, if you wish, Anarchy, Greed and Heresy). <br />Freedom allows people to do things. Landes portrayal of the centrally planned economies of ancient China, where the Emperor ruled everything, is powerful, and it seems to play a large role in the lack of initiative in China, despite the great achievements. <br />Capitalism, most noticeably in the form of Greed and Competition, drives people forward. Again, Landes comparison between the Chinese and the European Sea quests are enlightening. Europeans went in small ships, eager to outdo the competition and to come back making a fortune. The Chinese went with huge Ships, symbols of the empire rather than instruments of trade. They were unprofitable, victims of the ruler's whim, and, without a strong faction of interested merchants, had no chance of continuing throughout. Also interesting is that Europeans went looking for India and spices, while China was self-sufficient.<br />Science - Chinese science was much more sophisticated than European science back in the year 1,000. The Indians have invented the zero. But nowhere except in Europe did science work methodically, nowhere else was it progressive. Newton is famous of saying that he stood on the shoulder of giants - discoveries in China and the rest of the world were rarely followed up - gunpowder was discovered in China much before it was in Europe, but the Chinese never used it for weapons. In Europe, it became part of the war methods almost immediately. Landes discussions of clocks and glasses are particularly telling.<br />The Third Element - Culture - is the one with which I have the most trouble. Landes repeatedly attacks economists for discounting culture (for example in the last chapter, page 517 in my edition). He claims that they disregard it because it can't be quantified. Wrong. The reason Economists distrust culture is because it is such a 'one size fits all' argument. Japanese responds to the west was everything the Chinese should have done but didn't. ... Culture. Arab nations are stuck well behind everyone else, despite the great advantage they have in the shape of oil. ... Culture. Asians manage to pull themselves along, while most of the third worlders can't. ... Well, culture, again.<br />I'm not saying that Culture plays no part. Obviously it does. But it becomes an obstacle to understanding, and Landes can support it only with anecdotal evidence (a lovely and touching story of a Japanese woman), and unanswered question (Is Islam a cause for the suppression of women? maybe).<br />Despite this problem, this is a fascinating book. Yes, it is a little too pro-Western. The problem is really more one of emphasis than one of facts - in my view, Landes is pretty close the mark usually, but he much underestimates the responsibility of the West for African poverty. Something's are left relatively unexplained - the current fast rise of China, which might undertake the point Landes made about the vitality of Freedom<br />But ultimately, as Landes acknowledges, no one book can solve the question of poverty and wealth. The answer is necessarily multi-faceted. 'The Wealth and Poverty of Nations' (neat name, also) is a well-written and intelligent treatment of the question.	2003-03-08
US	51630889	R3EQUPUIMCONZJ	067976867X	470087128	Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge	Books	4	12	14	N	Y	Consilience: The Science of Everything?	Consilience, a book by biologist Edward O. Wilson, is a masterful narrative of an amazing width of topics: science history, biology, Brain Sciences, Ecology, even an eloquant crticism of Post Modernism. In this book, Wilson proved himself one of the greatest writers of Popular science - lucid, clear, and often funny.<br />But Consilience is more than just a popular science book. It is a call for a new kind of science - a unified discipline, a thread of knowledge leading from physics, through the key element of biological evolution, to the social sciences and even the humanities, art, religion, and the ecology.<br />In a sense, Consilience is very similar to Daniel Dennet's Darwin's Dangerous Idea. Both books deal with a huge array of items, also categorized as a chain leading from Physics to Ethics (and, in Dennet's case to God - or to the inexsistence of God. Wilson, more modest, stops at religion, and leaves a place for some sort of a deity in his cosmology). Ultimately, although Wilson's prose is superior, and some of his ideas are wonderful (especially early in the book. I loved the suggestion that Logical Positivism can be saved through biological information on how the brain works. There is a paradox there, but it is an approach to the question I never considered), Dennet's book is more considered and is the better of the two.<br />The reason for that is, as a scientific program, rather than as an ideology, Consilience doesn't hold water. First, the term is incredibly unclear. Sometimes, in its strong form, Consilience really is a call for one science, explaining a phenomena in all levels, from the human action to the evolutionary explanation for this phenomena, and finally to the physics behind the biology.<br />But one is struck by how little Wilson actually explains through this. His examples are remarkably minor. He can trace dreaming about Snakes to old world primates innate fear, and he explains which color words will be more frequant then others (blackand white tend to be higher up the hirarchy then Orange - hmm), but no explanation to any discrete historical event is ever offered. Does Consilience, in this strong regard, has anything to say about Keyensian economics? Can you trace the fall of the Weimar republic back to physics? Do we understand Hitchcock's movies better through an evolutionary perspective on human motives like greed and love? I don't think so.<br />Then, sometimes consilience means only that different disciplines should engage in dialogue. There's nothing objectionable in that, but it is far from tearing down the discipline barriers. And it is constantly done anyway - the latest winner of the Noble price in economics won it for work in psychology.<br />Wilson's Consilience keeps switching between these two extremes. Part of the problem, in my view, is that Wilson over emphasizes the links between the different levels of explanation. In particular, in the 'nature vs. nurture', debate, Wilson clearly believes everything is in the genes.<br />Wilson constantly denies that he believes in genetic determinism. Strictly speaking, that is true, but if Wilson closes a door by allowing for culture, he opens a window by talking about predisposition - human culture works based on preexisting biological directions (\\"epigenetic rules\\") - it intensifies and elaborates them, but rarely or never ignores them. That's an interesting twist, but it amounts to little but a longer road to the same destination.<br />Ultimately, the greatest problem I had with Consilience is that it isn't pragmatic. Yes, Unity is a wonderful thing (and despite my reservations, I tend to agree to that), but how do we get there? Wilson offers very little concrete steps. At the end, Consilience leaves you with a vivid description of the impending ecologic crisis, and a warm fuzzy feeling that consilience can solve it - but with very little about how consilience will be achieved, or indeed, what it means exactly.<br />I don't want to end my review in such a sour note. Wilson's prose is powerful, and he is a fascinating thinker. Even if I don't agree with him, the vision is provocative and fascinating, and in a sense, that is the greatest compliment possible.	2003-01-29
US	51630889	RSVK97CT077A6	0812580354	77230724	Calculating God	Books	2	12	20	N	Y	The Aliens Arrived... and they are creationists	I first judged 'calculating god' based on the free chapter in Robert Sawyer's webpage. Based on the first chapter, I got the following impressions:<BR>First, Sawyer's prose was remarkably clear and effortless. That is a great talent, and whatever weaknesses I found in the book, Sawyer does have the ability to write stuff that is genuinely easy to read. It is obvious that Sawyer is a discipline of the Futurian, Asimovian way of writing, much like Isaac Asimov and Orson Scott Card.<br />Second, that the writing was nonetheless clumsy. Sawyer writes lots of setnences like 'there were gasps from the small crowd that has assembled in the lobby; I tried to raise my non-existent eyebrows' (p.9).<br />There was lots of jokes and references to pop culture, especially TV and movie SF. Generally, that was over done and not funny. Very occasionally, the jokes work, like a reference to William Shatner as 'the man with the obviously fake hair'. But those were the exceptions rather then the rule.<br />Finally, the idea itself was very clever - suppose aliens come to Earth, and instead of being the cold, logical atheists we commonly expect from First Encounter SF, they actually believe an interventionist God.<br />Part of the problem I have with the book was that it failed to conform to my expectations. I was expecting the author to write a SF mystery, where the hero, Paleontologist Tom Jericho, would find a naturalistic explanation for the theological explanation offered by the aliens. After all, this was SCIENCE fiction, and the triumph of logic over superstition is among the most important themes of literary SF.<br />Based on this premise, I was willing to buy and read the novel, looking for a clever mind game. But frankly, what we get is a contradictory, unconvincing, teleological Deus Ex Machina story that isn't written well enough to justify the time you spend on it.<br />Among the first sign of trouble was alien visitor's Hollus's discussion of the grand unified theory. In the sample chapter, Hollus is shocked to discover that the protagonist, a scientist, is an atheist. He says \\"I know from your television that there is much an ambivalence about God in this part of your planet, at least among the general public, but I am surprised to hear that someone in your position is not personnally convinced in the existence of the creator\\"<br />But, in the discussion of the Grand Unified Theory, Hollus says that 'In the Past, most of the scientists in my workd were atheists or agnostic', and new, fictional science, convinced them otherwise. <br /> what a cope out! In the first scene, we expect a complete clash of view points, but now, Sawyer pulls a rabbit out of the hat, to explain away all problems with his theological arguments. 'New Scientific Theories' rule out two of the three best explanations for a universe without design - either that (1)it is impossible for the universe not to be fine tuned to life, or (2)that it is not improbable for the universe to be tuned to life, or (3)there are multiple universes. <br />Sawyer spends lots of what seems like real science attacking the middle proposition, and I may grant him that he pulls a convincing, although not a conclusive case, for the invalidity of that possibility, but dismissing multiple universes and the possibility of life being a necessary feature of the universe, is a cope out. It is playing unfairly with the readers.<br />Then again, this tendency is demonstrated throughout, in chapter 7, Sawyer discusses the game of life (pp.79-81) and COMPLETELY misses the point. I won't go into details, but the point is that again, Sawyer is inventing stuff (like the idea that the aliens have the same bases of D.N.A as we do - accepting that is pretty much the same as accepting design anyway) and not playing the game fairly.<br />For the most part, the scientific/philosophical arguments feel like a dumbed down and twisted version of a popularization. Particularly, the discussion of the game of lifeand the breadth of issues dealt with bring to mind Daniel Dennett's DARWIN'S DANGEROUS IDEA, which is even mentioned in the book. Suffice to say, Dennett's discussion of many of the same themes as in this book is remarkably more concise, intelligent and articulate.<br />Apart from the weak metaphysics, the characterisation and plot is extremely problematic. Of the two aliens encountered, Hollus is practically a human being in a rubber suit. Oh, occasionally he will not know the meaning of the work 'Supernova' or misunderstand some human gesture, but those are token things. In almost every regard, down to the sense of humor and ethics, Hollus is indistinguishable from human.<br />the other alien, a Wreed, is more alien. But in practice, he's a human who speaks in a bizarre way. There's an interesting suggestion that wreeds have no moral problems, and can teach their morality to humans and aliens, but in two points where moral input could be used, the Wreed refuse to give them. They seem to be there only for the author to pour out his views on trivial and non contruvertial issues like killing abortion doctors (wrong) conterception (right), minor family quarrels (solvable) and abortion in case of rape (permissable).<br />I didn't find the human characters more convincing. Tom Jericho who is called a 'Vampire Slayer' for fighting the museum evil bureaucrats. His wife and son, who adoringly reflect on the father and husband who left them earlier than he had to. Worse still are the creationists who, in the book's most unfortunate subplot, try to destroy the exhibitions in the museum.<br />Ultimately, Calculating God is not a good book. It does raise some interesting issues, but it fails to do them justice.	2002-12-20

Martin is my favourite living author, and having met him a few times in conventions, he's also a really great guy.  That Quartet is a frustrating read has nothing at all to do with Martin's truly great writing prowess, and everything to do with the problematic selection of material.<br />Frankly, there are two possible audiences for 'Quartet', and the book is a somewhat scysophrenic appeal for both.<br />For the die hard fans such as myself, the collection offers 'Black and White and Red All Over', the beginning of an unfinished novel, and STARPORT, an unproduced pilot for a television series.  <br />For the newbies, the collection features The Skin Trade, Martin's fantasy award winning werewolf novella, and Blood of the Dragon, an exerpt from 'A Game of Thrones'.  <br />Thus, no matter in which category you belong, the collection is only half for you.<br />'Black &  White begins with a classic Martin line 'On that dump April Morning Ned Cullen started his day with a glass of cheap champagne gone flat, a cup of cold black coffee, and a Murder'.  Merely reading that line made chills run down my spine.  This, I knew immediately, was going to be top notch Martin.<br />And it is.  The story of three journalists trying to solve a Jack the Ripper style Murder in later Victorian New York City is so obviously among Martin's best works that one is left amazingly frustrated to know that there is no ending, that the story ends in the middle of a scene, with a note from Martin which says, effectively 'that all I've got, sorry'.<br />As great as 'Black & White' is, though, you can see why it was rejected.  The complicated structure, and the detailed description of NYC (Martin has a knack for the Historical narrative, and it is a pity he doesn't do it more often.  Even more than in his Fantasy and Science Fiction, Martin has a way of making the past come alive) carries through a hundred pages in which, plot-wise, little yet happens.  Martin is setting the base forthe larger scheme, but, like Fevre Dream and A Storm of Swords, the build up is slow and meticulous and careful, unlike A Game of Thrones, where the action begins immediately.  This is hardly a bad thing for itself, and Black & White handles the exposition superbly, but as exposition, you cannot see where he's going yet.<br />The Next piece is 'The Skin Trade', the werewolf novella.  Willie and Randi are among Martin's most memorable characters, and the tale of haunted hunters is among his best.  The only weakness might be the slightly too complicated plot - after several readings, I'm still not one hundred percent sure I know exactly who did what and why.<br />But there is so much great writing there, such a powerful and nonchalant description of the paranormal, and Martin's wonderful way of making the exotic into common life, without losing any of the majestic beauty <br />So you admit you're a werewolf?\\" <BR>\\"A Lycanthrope... . So Sue Me.  It's a medical condition. I got allergies, I got asthma, I got a bad back, and I got lycanthropy, is it my fault?'<br />But than, a different character describes himself \\"Perhaps I'll come for you myself some night.  You ought to see me... .  My fur is white now, pale as snow, but the stature, the majesty, the power, those have not left me... We are the dire wolves, the nightmares who haunt your racial memories, the dark shapes circling endlessly beyond the light of your fires.\\"<br />An unproduced Screenplay, STARPORT, is a pilot for a series that never happened.  As such, it is a shame that Martin doesn't tell us something of what he had planned for the series.  It is difficult to judge the story on its own.  For example, is Kim, the Nazi girlfriend of undercover cop Aaron, a character that was supposed to return again?  If not, she gets much too much screentime. <br />STARPORT follows a police force in near future Chicago, where an alien constructed base exists.  The screenplay does a good job of introducing some memorable characters, but the plot suffers.  Usually, Martin is a masterplotter, his tales brilliantly conceived and excecuted.  Here, however, the plot is little more then a mechanism to get the characters to meet and interact.  Particularly weak is the solution to the mystery, which is obvious and expected, and robs us of a character which could have been a very effective source of conflict for the series.  <br />But STARPORT is a great piece of writing anyway, and would have made a very good introduction to what might have been the best SF TV show in recent memory.<br />The final selection is an excerpt from A Game of Thrones, telling the story of Dany, the princess lost in the wilderness, wed to a barbarian but fearsome warrier.  It is, of course, a very fine piece of work, the Dany narrative being one of the best realised parts in Martin's brilliant novel, but it is the least valuable in the bunch, because I doubt many readers of this book have not read it before.  and I have the feeling that the amazing climax to the story is more effective as the end of A Game of Thrones, than as a conclusion for a supposedly self standing novella.<br />Ultimately, I greatly enjoyed Quartet, both the fiction and Martin's wonderful introductions, but as the selection of pieces included is problematic, I can only recommand Quartet to die hard -got to have everything- fans such as myself.  If you are a casual reader, one who only read few if any Martin stories, you'll be much better off picking A Game of Thrones, Fevre Dream, the anthology Sandkings, or Robert Silverberg's Legends, which contains Martin's The Hedge Knight among much other great fiction, as introduction to one of today's greatest writers.	2002-11-08
US	51630889	R1NVV3JPOGIYPX	0192880519	256391565	The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene (Popular Science)	Books	4	105	114	N	N	Very Good, also very difficult	Richard Dawkins is one of the most interesting popular science writers working today, and usually his books are filled with insight and perception about evolution (and other topics), written in clear and effective prose.  This book is different from most of Dawkins's books, as it targets biologists rather than laypeople, and so it is a much more frustrating and difficult reading for such readers.<br />Frankly, if you are, like me, a lay person, don't read this book before reading other books by Dawkins, most notably The Selfish Gene, but also other stuff by him.  I doubt I would have understood this book had it been my introduction to Dawkins's ideas.  The glossary, though helpful, is far from complete and rarely detailed enough.<br />But for all this, The Extended Phenotype is richer in observations and ideas then any other book by Dawkins I have ever read.  Dawkins says this is his best book, and you can see that he has a point.<br />The book has three main themes.  The first is discussion of left over issues from The Selfish Gene, answering criticism and elaborating on the ideas in that book.  The second is clarifying some issues in discussion of evolution, such as replicators and vehicles, fitness, etc.  The third one, and the one for which Dawkins is most proud is his 'Extended Phenotype' - the concept that genes operate on the enviornment, and that the body (the individual organism) is a link in the chain of orders passing from DNA to the external phenotype - beaver dams or host behaviour that helps the parasite, or any other activity that helps the genes.<br />Frankly, the concept of the extended phenotype is best explained in the chapter about 'The Long reach of the gene' in the new (1989) edition of  'The Selfish Gene'.  The book is actually best when Dawkins deals with the two other themes -difining genes for example, and discussing replicators.  Those chapters are masterworks of clear, essential thinking, of which Dawkins is always a champion.<br />Finally, one would wish that the book was updated.  Many discussions are based on information that at the time was brand new, and follow up would be useful.  uinfortunately, Dunnet's afterword does not do the trick, and is more of a hymn to Dawkins (albeit a justified one) than anything else.<br />'The Extended Phenotype' is not an easy read, but it is definetly worth it.	2002-07-08

But the truth is, Willis is actually a better writer then Adams, because she is (1) more consistently brilliant then he is and (2) has serious, important issues running through her work.  Her funny stories are rarely *just* funny.<br />Lincoln's Dreams, however, is a first novel, and it shows.  Lots of Willis's traits are there:  the interest in History and in obscurities and ancedotes, the downplayed romance, the paralel storyline between a puzzle the characters have to solve and their personal lives, some very nice turns of phrase.<br />But Lincoln's Dreams lacks alot of things Willis will improve on in her following works.  The sense of humor, which is there even in her bleakest work (1993 Hugo and Nebula winner DOOMSDAY BOOK), is almost completely missing in this book.  <br />The characters - people tend to talk about Willis's characterisation, but in truth, Willis uses architypes all the time.  The characters in her books are almost identical (Think about the female leads of Even the Queen, Passage and Bellwhether, or on the male characters in To Say Nothing of The Dog, Remake, and also Passage), bot because Willis can't write different characters (as she does with the Quivrin in *Doomsday Book*), but because she builds a comedy that is based on our instant recognition of the characters, and thus can focus on the serious issues she disguises in the crazy and funny plots.<br />But in Lincoln's Dream, this ability isn't yet developed, and so the characters, instead of having the stock identity which allows us to sympathise with them while we follow their adventures, don't have any characterism whatsover.  Broun and Annie are completely forgettable (Unlike Vallery in TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DOG, we never understand why Jeff falls for Annie).  The only exceptions are Jeff, who is not yet the developed Willis leade personnality, but is the closest, and Richard, who is an archytype of later Willisean villains, but isn't quite one yet.<br />But the greatest weakness in this novel is that, literally nothing happens.  There is no plot as to speak of.  There's the mystery of what is the source of Annie's dreams.  We get three solutions to that, all satisfactory, but Willis hasn't yet mastered the art of having her characters come to realisation about the nature of the plot, which later she will become very good at.  So we don't feel like there really is a mystery here - we're never involved with Jeff's quest, and we can't even try to guess ahead.<br />And beyond the attempt to solve the dreams, we're in complete stasis throughout the book.  Jeff and Annie are hiding from Richard, going to Civil War monuments, checking phone calls on the machine, and Jeff tries to convince Annie to take it easy.  That's a simplification, but there really is little sense of progress.  From page 50 to page 180 or so, the scenes are almost all interchangable.<br />Ultimately, Lincoln's Dreams (which should've been called Lee's Dreams), is not a bad book.  There is enough interesting history, and an interesting final solution to the mystery, to justify reading it.  But it is nowhere near as powerful a book as Willis's later works.	2002-03-17

I was somewhat overly optimistic, but generally this still stands.  Snodgras never wrote anything worthwhile for the Wild Cards again.  <br />The only Wild Card book I've read so far, this is very promising.<br />I think I'll start with the bad things first. Too many of the stories don't work. Some, like Witness, are bad, while many (maybe most) seem to be a beginning, setting the stage without solving anything. ( that is especially true of stories like ' The long night of Fortunato')<br />Also, there are to many characters, and the story isn't focused enough. It covers thirty years, but most of the time its not very vivid. The early stories, at least, all feature Tchyon as a main character, but then he disappears, and that's a shame.<br />Now for the good part. <br />First, the intervals are great. Especially the one summing up the red scare, and the one with the quotes. <br />Also the one with about the science behind the wild Card virus.<br />Then we have the premise, which is great. The world, and many of the characters, seem fascinating. I love the wild card virus.<br />Also, three of the stories are simply exellent. Those are, Sleeper, by Roger Zealany, Strings, by Stephan Leigh, and especially, Degredation Rites, by Mellinda sondgrass, which is a touching, tragic love story, as well, as a powerful political tale.<br />The best thing about the book, though, is the great promise it contains. It thrills me, and I'm sure I'm gonna love the next books.	2002-01-27

Bush	Books	4	22	39	N	N	Read it... but with a grain of salt	I'm not an American, so my view of this book is probably rather different than that of the average American, at least insofar as I'm less interested in character and party issues, and focusing more on questions of policy, especially international (i.e. foriegn)  affairs and enviormental issues, as well as issues in which the world is quick to follow US leadership.<br />Begala's book is an enditement of Bush.  It has several major short-commings, some of them issues of methodology and some of content.<br />First, Begala is clearly biased.  I don't mind that asmuch as some others - I prefer a person who admits his or her biases and allows the audience to judge his words given the biases, than people who preach while pretending to be neutral.<br />More troubling, though is his lack of consideration of the Republican or pro-Bush campaign answers to his argument.  At least in one issue (minimum wage), Bush's position has an economic basis and argument behind it that Begala completely ignores. One must wonder in how many other issues the Republicans have a reasonable argument that Begala fails to mention.<br />Begala's research is fairly poor, too, generally based on newspaper clipping.  I don't necessary object to that, and I appreciate time related problems narrowing this book's depth, but sometimes Begala can make an attack at Bush based on a single quotation from a newspaper.  This seems unappropriate.<br />Issue-wise, Begala's chapter on foriegn policy is far from satisfactory.  I realise that most Americans don't really care about this, but US policies regarding International Organizations such as NATO, the WTO and the EU, towards countries like Russia and China, and to areas like the Balkans, the Middle East and Africa, are vital for the lives of hundreds of millions of people, and yes, they also effect the US.  Nuclear War, for example, would cause some disturbance to the US way of life.  What does Bush intend to do foriegn policy wise?  How reliable are hisw advisers, people like Colin Powel and Cordelia Rice?  From Begala we get very few issues discussion and many Bushisms.<br />Finally, the last chapter discusses Bush's intelligence.  This is the most unsatisfactory of all parts.  In essence, it amounts to what people who don't really know him talking about him, to Begala discussing Bush's definition of inteligence (whatever for?), and to a great deal of Bushisms.  He concludes that Bush suffers from 'Intelectual Lazyness' . This is the place for research.  Talk to Bush's professors, read his university papers, review his writing.  TELL US HOW BUSH GOT INTO HARVARD!  Begala seems to suggest is was only because of Bush's father.  But than he quotes a Harvard classmate who says Bush was average in his Harvard class... and he brings no evidence to his claim.  He demonstrates no case of Bush's failure to analyse issues.  At the ends, he resorts to establishing that, ' the very existence of the question says something on Bush'.  Oh really?<br />  But for all of this, you should read this book.  First, because it's fun - Begala writes well, in a very conversational, humorous tone.  He sometimes shows great gifts of communications, explaining difficult ideas easily and effectively.<br />  Most important, though, this book does cast many doubts on Doublu.  Especially when talking about his alligance to rich corporations, the NRA, his lack of support for enviornment issues, and his policy about death penalty ( I'm not against it - but Bush spends FIFTEEN minutes reviewing cases of death penalty before signing them on, and he literally allows sleeping lawyers to rest still).  <br />Be cautious and skeptical when you read this book, but read it, because it will tell you who the most powerful man in the world right now is... and shed light on what he might do in the future...	2001-06-22

Of a sort, I say, because even though I enjoyed this book way more than the last one, I still think the Wild Cards have taken a wrong turn somewhere.<br />Start with the good?  Well, the good is Walton Simon, who wrote another 'nobody' story, and this time more succesfully than other times, maybe because he doesn't have to carry a whole book on his back.  Even Lewish Shiner surprises us with a story almost decent - how unbelievable is that?  <br />The Really good is Stephen Leigh and Walter Jon Williams.  Boy do these guys deliver.  The Wild Cards need way many more writers like them.  I've heard good things about 'Black Shadow', and it is all true.  He's become one of my favorite characters.  Strong, vicious, and ultimately just.  <br />Leigh's Bloat is one of the main narratives in this Wild Cards book, and while I don't QUITE like his stuff as much as I like the Puppetman, but this is also high quality fiction.<br />The Bad, though, is the general story.  The Jumpers were a mistake, making St. Lethem the villain was a mistake, some of the plot twists concerning Bloat seems like a mistake, and the entire Blaise character ark ( and some might say his entire character) have been misconcieved.<br />However, the REALLY bad is Melinda Snodgras's Tachyon.<br />What happened to the woman who wrote what is still one of the best Wild Cards stories out there 'Degredation Rites'?  That story had real emotion, cleverness, subtlty.  But this...<br />Her story in WC 9, 'Lovers' is an awful 'hit you over the head' feminist message thing.  OK, so Tachy's a chauvinist, what else is new?  The story is so weak, pathetic and uninteresting, it actually ruined several stories which were more or less related.  The dignity of Tachyon is all gone ( I believe I've discussed the over-exosure of the character back in WC4.  Boy, was I right).  I do hope they'll kill Tach off and Snodgras will either try and write more stuff like 'degredation rites' or go away.<br />Because, at the end of the day, we need more stuff like 'Degredation Rites' to make the WC world interesting again.  The Wild Cards aren't SUPERHERO stories - they're, at their best, an action and plot oriented attack on the problems of society using Science Fiction.  Plotlines like the 'Jampers' only make the story weaker, because mindless action we can get elsewhere.  The entire Jampers ark is, for this reader, insubstantial and reeking of Fantasy, not even wild Science Fiction.<br />Maybe this review has been too harsh.  Jokertown Shuffle is entertaining.  But to me, the Wild Cards can be much more than that, and I hope it'll return to form soon.	2001-05-09
US	51630889	R29P3MD9RA7JNX	0061057274	137727085	Distress	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Mind Blowing	Distress is a very unique novel.  It is a quest for the intelect, a discussion of the implications of technology on our lives, and even more importantly, discussion about the implications of actual science on life.<br />If you want to know what the future will be like, Egan is a place to look for inspiration (although not for answers).  Egan not only understands technology and science, and not only has the imagniation to forsee the future in ways which are original and thought provoking, but is able to see the social consequences of technology.<br />Egan's story, especially in the first two thirds of the novel, is an almost entirely successful and constant challange to the mind, in an enjoyable story.  Egan's prose is powerful, and you can often enjoy his phrases, and while his minor characters are awfully indistinguishable, the two major ones, Violet Mosala and Andrew Worth, are very well realised and are sympathetic.<br />The novel contains ideas about the Theory of Everything.  The theory of Everything is a unification of Einstein's theory of Relativity and Quantom Mechanics - it's a theory that can explain, at least theoretically, EVERYTHING, from the motions of planets to those of electrons.<br />The novel doesn't speculate as much about TOE itself, but about the social and psychological and even ethical responses of it, and it does so by introducing a pseudo-scientific religion which glorifies and demonises the descoverer of the theory.<br />This religion is interesting, but it is one of the two major failure of the novel because (slight spoiler here) it turns up that it is true in a sense.  This changes the story from a scientific to a metaphysic one, and pushes us towards the realms of fantasy.<br />The other major weakness is that Egan's plotting and story elements are relatively poor.  Crisises can be resolved in manners which are hardly satsifactory to the reader, in the sense that they rarely are well established or given proper pay off.  Egan attempts to write a 'thriller' especially at the end, and it doesn't work.<br />But those are relatively minor problems.  Distress is a novel of ideas, and thus it functions brilliantly.  It'll make you think.  So go read it.	2001-04-17

In all eight Wild Cards books, this is easily the worst.  Which is a shame, because it came after a series of above average Wild Cards novels (Down and Dirty/Ace in the Hole/The Dead Man's Hand), WC 5 and 7, especially, were the best in the series in my humble opinion.<br />The list of authors was by itself a bad sign: no George R. R. Martin, no Roger Zelazny, no Pat Cadigan or Walter Jon Williams.  In other words, with the exception of Stephen Leigh, the heavy guns of the Wild Cards are missing.<br />Also, Leigh and Miller, who can generally guarantee entertaining stories about their characters, Greg Hartmann and Yeoman Brennan, aren't writing about them.  This is particularly irritating in the case of Leigh, because his Hartmann stories are amoung the best things the WILD CARDS have to offer, and in this point in time, we're especially interested in where they're going.<br />OK, enough about what there ISN'T in this novel.  What IS there?  well, the sad truth is, not much, and sadly very little we haven't seen before.  <br />About half of the novel is written by Walton Simons, and details the happening of that guy who used to be the giant Ape.  I admit to have little urgent wish to learn about him, and his story, while not particularily bad, isn't very engaging.  Also the titles, all puns based on the word Nobody, are particularily weak.<br />(BTW, I got a suspicion that all the stories'names here are based on titles of Rock songs.  But that might just be because Lewish Shiner used 'Horses' the name of Patti Smith's classic, for a completely Horses free story).<br />Anyway, the plot, as far as there is one, focuses on a new bunch of ace kids, who can switch bodies with you and kill you.  Sounds unexciting?  It is.  Not nearly as interesting as villains as the Astronomer was, they seem to be made of the 'forgettable' kind.  I'm awfully uninterested in them.<br />Snodgras gives us another Tachyon soap opera.  After I almost learned to like him again in Martin and Miller's The Dead Man's Hand, Snodgras abuses her little character again.  She really shouldn't have been allowed to write any more Tachy stories after her very first 'Degredation Rites'.  This one is particularily awful, as it involves Tachyon's falling for a doctor in the clinique ( who had LOVE INTEREST written all over her), and Blaise's final move into the dark side.  This I found completely unappealing.  Blaise seemed much more interesting as a guy who was neither here or there, someone both good and bad.  Making him finally a villain just made him tedious.  Although, Snodgras does give him some great lines &quot;It was FUN being a terrorist'.<br />Miller gives us a story about conspiracies within the Shadow Fist organisation.  That was pretty well executed, even if it didn't always make much sense.  Definetly the best use of those jumper kids in the book.<br />The best piece here was, not unexpectedly, Leigh's story 'sixteen candles'.  A pretty good tale about The Oddity, a threesome locked into one body, and their advanture.  It is well written, but it suffers from a tame plot and uninteresting background character.  Also the Oddity, as fun as he/she/it is, isn't nearly as interesting as the Puppetman.<br />All in all, it wasn't  terrible, but it wasn't good.  The WC, perhaps expectedly, is a really unequal enterprise, and this was on the weak side.  Let's hope that the next one will be better.	2001-04-03

It also promotes a Christian agenda.<br />There are lots of Propaganda works out there, but Orson Scott Card does a different piece of propaganda.  Card realised that you can't rely on the supernatural to validate Christianity.  If you say something like 'Christianity is the best because God said so', it's a circular logic that doesn't convince anyone (For example to that, the Pope has the ability to speak 'Ex Cathedra' - that is, in the name of God.  In all of history, Popes have done that maybe 11 times.  The very first thing that a Pope declared Ex Cathedra was that when he speaks Ex Cathedra he speaks for God.  That's a kind of circular argument we would find hard to swallow).<br />Therefore, Orson Scott Card's agenda in this book was to prove the superiority of Christianity in a social context - to prove that Christianity is superior because it makes people better off.<br />One of the interesting facets about OSC's SF is that Card is very conscience about the religious life of his characters.  Religion plays a huge role in his works, and most of Card's characters are believers in one sense or the other.  Card sometimes attacked the vision of humanity as `evolving beyond religion' that is often expressed in science fiction.<br />And yet, notice that OSC's future society in Pastwatch contains No Religion.  Here our great crusader for Christianity's cause AND for spiritual importance of people creates a future, semi idealic Earth, in which human beings have `out grown religion'.  The only religious people in the future part of the book, as far as I can recall, are the Muslim guy with a fairly minor role, and a priest that has exactly 7 lines.  (I haven't counted).<br />Interesting don't you think?  Especially considering two elements: the huge role religion, and especially Christianity plays in the past, and the size of the moral dilemma standing in front of Card's future characters.<br /> The historical people are quite occupied with Religion.  Especially Columbus.  Here we have Card constructing a world of complex religious character, which paints Christianity in a positive colour, but doesn't fear to seemingly criticise - never Christianity as such, but always the Christians practising it. <br />Even more important is the huge moral dilemma standing in front of the Future people.  They have to judge whether they should sacrifice their world.  We're talking about saving the whole world, and you don't see any priest around, you don't see anyone calling for God.<br />To me, this says two things.  The first is OSC is criticising the atheist world present in SF so often.  Card is saying basically that this world must self-destruct, that humanity can't survive without Christianity.  The doom of the non-Christian world is the theme card is playing with.<br />The second issue is the choice.  At the end, the future heroes decide to change the world.  However, the way they do it is by creating an American/European Christian alliance.  This means the destruction of the native culture of the Americans and its substitute by Christianity.<br />In a letter to me, Card defended this as an interventionist policy, a reaction to the human sacrifice conducted for the native American God.<br />Here Card is dealing with what I consider to be double standards.  He doesn't blame Christianity for the crimes of Christians.  The crusades where done for the glory of God, but Card doesn't blame Christianity for them, but only societies and individual Christians.  On the other hand, the native Americans' sacrifice of humans in counted against their religion.<br />If I recall correctly, Card argued that Christianity was in essence `manipulated' to allow for the slaughters of God's enemies, while the human sacrifice was caused by the religion of the native Americans.<br />This is a problematic argument on two grounds: First, there is a school of thought, by people such as Hiram Mekubi (sp?), whobelieve that the doctrine of Christianity is Anti-semitic by nature.  I don't know enough about the ideas of this group to comment on it, but clearly, saying that Christianity is morally `right' religion while the Native American religion wasn't, is problematic at best.<br />More importantly, though, it is quite possible to change a facet of a religion without changing it all.  The best example is one Card is certainly very well familiar with, that of the church of later day Saints - of the Mormons.  For a long time, Mormons were involved in polygamy relationships - allowing multiple wives for one man.  However, under pressure from the US government, this practice died out.  It is not necessary to destroy an entire religion because of one aspect of it.<br /> Card is rightfully and wholeheartedly against the atrocities committed by the Europeans against the native Americans.  However, Card doesn't mind the cultural disaster inflicted upon the natives by the Christians.  In fact, his vision is of the same kind of cultural destruction.<br />The consequence of heroes' actions in the Card's book is that a Pax Christiana - a Christian peace comes to the world.  Thus, the ending of the novel is in a Christian Utopia, guided by pure Christian ideals.<br />And atheists form this Christian utopia, the last atheists of a destroyed, non-Christian world.  This is the victory of Christianity, as the non-Christians are convinced in the supremacy and superiority of Christ.  Symbolically, Card is passing the torch - from the unreligious world that fails to the glory of Christendom, a world united under Christ.<br />Thus, as I found Pastwatch to be a good book, I'm still troubled by the messages it contains.<br />P.S.  As I was writing it, I was thinking of several other parallels to Christianity, which might or might not be coincidences.  Is it an accident that there are 3 people sent to save the world, one of them a woman, and is there something Christ-like about the sacrifice ofout world in favour of the new, Christian kingdom?<br />If you have any answers, email me.	2001-02-14

Well, I shall certainly remedy that.  If Scandalmonger is any sign, William Safire might just be one of the most able writers in the US today.<br />Seriously, it must have been six months since I've last enjoyed a novel as much as I have enjoyed this one.  Written with clear, powerful and well thought of prose (In the afterwords, Safire reveals some of the tricks that he used in order to convey the atmosphere without falling into the use of anarchonisms), this book is always thrilling and often witty, for those of us who enjoy subtle, sharp irony.<br />You don't have to reach the appendixes in order to realise the width of Safire's knowledge of the topic.  Safire is clearly very well versed with the history of the period, and it shows.  Not a very descriptive writer, Safire clearly knows alot about the personality of each and evry character in the novel.  Writing with a Historian's dedicacy, even Safire's lies are rarely more than half truths.<br />The Pacing and prose of Scandlemonger are perfect.  It is a page turner, very well written and planned.  Safire never lets his grip loose, and every word counts.<br />The parallels between the US of the 1790s-1800s and the US of the 1990s-2000s are overwhelming, and surprisingly, you feel some appreciation to the history of journalism.  I think it is impossible to read Scandalmonger without thinking about Monica Lewinski, but the novel will still be every bit as good when Lewiski, like Sally Hemmins, will be left as no more than an ancedote in US history.<br />I can not recommand Scandalmonger enough.  In each and every aspect it is a masterpiece of fiction.  In one word: TRIUMPH.	2001-02-05

Miller is one of the best Wild Cards books so far.  Eventhough I don't generally like the mosaic novels, this is a prime example on how it should be done.<br />  It's possible that it is so succesful because there are only two writers, which clearly helps the pace.  And ofcourse, the fact that half the book is written by my favorite writer George R. R. Martin, speaks for itself.<br />  Dead Man's Hand is a 'parallel novel' to Wild Cards VI: Ace in the Hole.  It follows a plotline that was mentioned in WC6, but not exploared - Chrysalis's murder, and the attempts by Martin's Jay 'Popinjay' Acroyd and Miller's 'Yeoman' Brennan to find the killer.<br />  Popinjay, previously meerely a secondary character, proves to be a classic Martin hero - witty, clever and seemingly superficial, there is more to him than meets the eye, although that is only revealed slowly.  I must admit I was disappointed that we won't see the Turtle in this story, but Jay was a suitable compensation.<br />  Yeoman was a different story.  Although I have allways liked him, his new love affair with Jennifer 'Wraith' Maloy, is not only unlikely but uninteresting, unlike his past relation with Chrysalis.  Now Brennan is little but your average action hero running aroung beating people up and delivering one liners.<br />  As a mystery, the novel works rather well.  Certainly the identity of the killer is unexpected.  On the other hand, the authors don't quite let you feel this is a Mystery novel - you're too focused on the action/thrilelr plots resolving the story of T-Malice, the master that enslaved so many Wild Cards characters, and the Shadow Fist gang - who try to benefit from Chrysalis's murder.<br />  One of the things I liked best about this novel was the focus on jokers.  Although the heros are an ace and a nat, there are more Jokers active in this Wild Cards novel than in any other, many of them showing strength and courage.  The Wild Cards series tends to focus on Aces, but I personnaly like the Jokers at least as much, and quite possibly more.  The dark side of the Virus, so to speak, can be more fascinating than the more obvious Superhero stuff.<br />  Overall Dead Man's Hand is a thrilling ride, filled with action, advanture, cool ideas, and an extremely powerful climax, in which there is a confrontation between several major characters.  The confrontation at the end is one of the Wild Cards' strongest moments, and this novel certainly holds up there with DOWN AND DIRTY, as the best of the Wild Cards so far.	2000-11-20
US	51630889	R23WLGGY1MOUY8	0140296271	928300055	Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII	Books	4	13	23	N	N	An Fascinating account of a complex figure	The subject of the Pope's behaviour during the 2nd World War is a very sensitive topic.  As the author notes, hundreds of millions world wide believe the Pope to Christ's vicar on Earth.  The Pope's behavior while one of the most monsterous crimes humanity has ever witnessed is thus a highly personalised topic for many.<br />John Cornwell treats the topic with care and a balanced approach.  I'm no expert on the subject, and my knowledge of the Church's relations with the Nazi regime restircted to general readings I've made about WW2 and the holocaust, but I've been impressed with the research and study of the author.  His knowledge is rich, both in understanding and analysing historical event and documents (be it the Vatican Canon Law, Hitler's rise to power or international relationship during the war), and with regards to ancedotes and personnal information (He comments, amoung other things, about discussions between Pius XII and both T.S. Elliot and Orson Wells).<br />Perhaps the most fascinating of Cornwell's insights is his interpretation of Pius XII's actions as part of the trends in the modern Roman Catholic Church.  Cornwell forwards a powerful arguement about the struggle of the church between modernisation and pluralism and the more traditional, authoriterian forces with in the church.  Those, at least, ring true to me in light of recent decleration, such as the document on the Church's relations with the Jews.<br />The only weakness I could find was Cornwell's minimal consideration of the arguement that, had the Pope spoken out, many more would have suffered.  This seems like a strong arguement for Pius XII's silence, and while it is mentioned, a more detailed analysis of it would have been welcome.  Clearly, though, Pius XII did not feel the same about Communist Russia, which he justifiably apposed fiercely, as Cornwell aknowledges.<br />Eugenio Pacelli's character is very complex and hard to decipher, and I think that this book is an important step in comprehending him and his actions.  I would recommand this book to anyone interested in the Roman Catholic Church, The Nazi regime, World War 2 or the holocaust - in short, to everyone.	2000-10-21

Before I've read three Varley short stories:  The Exellent 'Press Enter' which was one of the finest novellas I've ever read, and a Hugo award winner, 'Air Raid' which was the basis for the movie 'Millenium', which was pretty good, and 'Goodbye, Robinson Crusoe' which was an unsuccesful 8 Worlds short story.<br />The consensus amoung SF fans seems to be that Varley is a great short story writer, but not a terrific novelist.  When thy talk about his novels, the only one that is REALLY appreciated seems to be 'The Ophiuchi Hotline'.  After reading it, I can testify that it is indeed a novel worth talking about.<br />The Ophiuchi Hotline of the title is a stream of information coming from Ophiuchius constelation.  It is the basis of all human knowledge for 5 hundred years - after all, when you got all the answers supplied, why bother studying?<br />The Story's heroine, Lilo, does wish to study.  Furthermore, she wishes to study human genetics - which is illegal.  The book follows her story, mostly, as she struggles in a world filled with deception, intrigue, and some of the coolest Science Fictional explorations of many a theme, most notably cloning.<br />the stuff John Varley does with the idea of cloning in this story, especially at one point about 50 pages into it is brilliant and original.  Varley's thoughts about cloning are striking and very clever.<br />The plotting and characterisation of the novel is generally very well done.  Varley can truely differentiate his characters, and manages to make a very complicated plot decievingly simple to follow.<br />If there's a weakness to the novel it is the ending.  All the plots line are resolved, which is quite a difficult and an impressive task, but the novel's end of kind of disappoint anyway.  You're expecting a bang, and it goes down with a whispher.  A LOUD whispher, mind you, but nonetheless.<br />Still, Varley is in top form here, and I would recommand this novel easily.  It is out of print, but not too hard to find.  Go get it.	2000-10-08

The cliche would be to say that words can't express how great this book is, but that, of course, is false.  For words DO express how great it is - George R. R. Martin's words, though, not mine.<br />A Storm of Swords is the third, and the best (so far), of the Epic Fantasy series A Song of Ice anf Fire.  In a time when half the world is writing Epic Fantasy, George R. R. Martin is the only one who is doing it as it should be done.<br />A Storm of Swords' pace is like that of a snowball, it start small and slow, and accelerates.  The book's beginning is a masterful art of wieving threads together, and about a third way into is you start to shadder because you're in the most incredible rollar costar imaginable, and it won't let you off until the very ending, and you'll be left suffering until a Dance with Dragons will be out in 2002 - but that's true for all of us Martin fans.<br />A Storm of Swords shows Martin's loathing of happy endings and black/white characters - Martin's world is so realistic it hurts.  The morality gets much more complicated, as we get indights into a character we thought was a villain, and see his actions completely differently.<br />The twists are very logical, but completely surprising.  For each development predicted by the fans, three weren't.  Some questions are answered, but more are asked, and through the entire story, the Stark words can be heard: &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;<br />After A Clash of Kings, I thought Martin wrote a story that was practically impossible to top.  But he has, and now all I can do is to count the days until A DANCE WITH DRAGONS	2000-10-08
US	51630889	R9C9Y3RAUBKZG	0312975228	351248779	Boy in the Water	Books	4	1	2	N	N	And you thought your High School was problematic?	I've read and enjoyed Stephen Dobyns's The Church of Dead Girl, and while Boy in the Water isn't quite as powerful as Dobyns's other novel, it is still a magnificent read.<br />   Unlike TCoDG, Boy doesn't use the first person narrative, but choses a third person approach that allows him to focus on many more characters.  Although most of the characters are well done, three stand out, and luckily Dobyns's best characters are also the two protagonists:  Jim Hawthorne, the psychologist who runs the school, and who has to recover from a dark personal tragedy, and Jessica, a young girl who worked as a stripper in order to try and save her brother.  Both of them, as well as another character, a young boy from school called Scott, are very interesting and with fascinating internal lives.<br />The weakest characters are the love-interest, who screams out LOVE INTERESTS starting from the first scene in which she appears, and the villain, who comes off as shallow and irritating, although to Dobyns's credit he is also very, very creepy.  <br />Like with 'The Church of Dead Girls', BOY's best parts are those in which Dobyns deals with the interraction in between the individual and the community.  Bishop's Hill, the school in which the story takes place, actually has a very strong sense of being more than a place - being a structure created by the characters which inhibit it.  Dobyns demonstrates again his superb insight into group dynamics, and the way, for instance, in which events take over the entire school (rummers, for instance), are a dlight to read.<br />Still, BOY in the water has three weaknesses that disapointed me somewhat.     <br />First, the book contains several stock Horror clisches, none of which works particularily well.  We get a rationalized ghost, telephone calls from the dead, and a climax in which the school is left completely isolated from the world around it.  All these are much less effectives than the scenes in which Dobyns actually comes up with NEWHorror ideas.<br />Second, there are several irritating plot holes.  A Serial killer, who has clearly killed before, using a fixed MO, is never tracked by any big enforcement agency.  Also, although his identity is kept secret, all the other villains know who he is, or at least know that he's corruptable.<br />But perhaps the thing most lacking from 'Boy in the Water' is the kind of spooky atmosphere of mistrust that Dobyns so perfectly established in 'The Church of Dead Girls'.  the haunted paranoid feeling in The Church of Dead Girls contributed ALOT to my liking of it, and I'm disappointed that he hasn't been quite able to recapture it.<br />  Nonetheless, Boy in the Water is a veery good read, the kind of book that is both clever and a page turner.    <br />  If you enjoyed The Church of Dead Girls, you'll enjoy this too.  If you haven't read Dobyns, though, Start with the previous novel.	2000-09-24

It  aims very, very high, whether Sterling's aim was accurate, is for everyone  to judge individually.<br />I had very high expectations from this book.  I've  previously read Sterling's 'The Swarm', the very first Shapers/Mechanist  story, in Gardner Dozois's anthology, THE GOOD NEW STUFF, and liked it  alot.<br />Furthermore, the last two books I've read were very different from  each other, and both really good - George R. R. Martin's new Fatasy Epic A  Storm of Swords, and Stephen Zweig's The Royal Game.  In between those two  masterworks, I've read the prologue to Schismatrix, and loved it.<br />What  impressed me most about the prologe, about the Swarm and indeed about the  novel itself, was the scope and the vividness of Sterling's Future.  The  Shapers/Mechanist universe is clearly one of the most fascinating and  exotic worlds created in Science Fiction.<br />So I came to Scismatrix with  exteremly high expectations, believing I was about to read a classic on par  with Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, Frank Herbert's Dune, or Dan  Simmons's Hyperion Cantos.<br />The first 80 pages cured me of that hope.  I'm  not a passionate Cyber-Punk fan, quite the contrary, and the first 80 pages  consist of a Cyber Punk story set in Space.  A well written Cyber Punk, no  doubt - others have commented on Sterling's prose, and he has a great deal  of talent, but a traditional Cyber Punk story nonetheless, and thus  somewhat out of date.<br />However, after those 80 pages, Sterling changes the  style fo the novel, and returns to the issue of the introduction - the wide  spread political sweeps that take the universe, as Sterling's hero,  Lindsay, finds his peaceful life threatens by both his ideology and his  long time friend turned bitter enemy, Constantine.<br />And then, the novel  changes again, this time becomes a generational story, of the hero passes  through a universe which changes in terrifying speed.  Sterling attempts  the kind of paradigm shifting SF story telling, as evident in such works as  Clarke's Childhood's End, and in the process comes up with some very nice  touches - a particularly lovely scene is the final meeting between Lindsay  and his long friend/Archi Nemesis Constantine.<br />All in all the novel, and  the stories, portray a wonderfully realised world.  But they lack the kind  of plot structure and advances necessary to make this kind of work  appealing to me, and the ideas, while sometimes fascinating are often  reduced to merely new Jargon versions of old clisches.<br />My own high  expectations damaged my enjoyment of the novel, but Í have enjoyed it  nonetheless, and would recommand it to others.  Schismatrix is a seminal  work of Cyber Punk, and an immaginative attack on the age old tradition of  SF - and for that it deserves to be read.	2000-09-10

The Second book,  especially, is among the best SF books I've read.<br />The Peace War is,  seemingly, a fairly standard SF novel: in a post apocalyptic world, a  dictatorship took over, and the brave heroes fight it off.  Except that it  is much more than that - Vinge's talent, his characters and his ideas all  turn this B movie premise to an original, powerful SF novel.  Especially  important is Vinge's simple but brilliant invention of the 'Bubble's -  spheres which are completely shielded off the world, in which time doesn't  move.<br />'Marrooned in Realtime' takes the premise established in the first  novel, and pushes it beyond belief.  The beginning of 'Marooned',  especially, is idea oriented SD at it's finest - you read going WOW every  two seconds.<br />Idea oriented SF is probnably the hardest thing in the  universe to write - you need not only to know how to write well, not only  to understand science, but also to come up with a scientific idea which has  mind opening reprecussions.  I think I can count on 1 hand the number of  times I've seen Idea oriented SF done right - this is one of the prime  examples.<br />If you're a lover of SF, Across Realtime will be a parade of  ideas, characters, action and thrills.

He wins awards all over  the place, and justifiably so - his collaboration with Terry Preachett,  Good Omens, is one of the best Speculative Fiction books of the 90s, and  his Magnum Epic, The Sandman, is praised as one of the best ever Graphic  novels series, and unlike most of the praises of this sort, it isn't even  slightly exagerrated.<br />Gaiman is also a very diverse author:  He writes in  many lengths - his latest book is a collection of short fiction, and he  wrote long novels (Neverwhere, Good Omens) and short ones(like this one) he  writes very adult material(Sandman) along with with stuff that can be  appreciated by people of all ages(Stardust again).  He writes Graphic  Novels, Scripts, Novels, Short stories and poetry.  He writes Horror,  Fantasy, both Urban and Fairy tale style and even Science Fiction and  mainstream fiction.  But most importantly, He writes well.<br />Stardust is a  testament for Gaiman's ability to write in a style that is both enchanting  and inviting.  His books are easy to read - they're not page turners in the  sense of 'Oh I wonder what's going to happend next'  but in the sense of  'Wow, it's already finished?'  It is effortless reading, but high value  ones.<br />In this little charming story, Gaiman's sense of humor and writing  abilities keep you reading as he tells you of witches, falling stars, and,  as allways, twists on the tale.  Gaiman has a maiden in distress story, but  this time, the lady is held captive by the Hero(!), who wants to bring her  as a present for his true love(!!).<br />Gaiman is one of the most exciting  authors around, and he rarely disappoints.

Other than Lewis Shiner's story, I liked  all of them, but I'm gonna talk about the ones that made the most  impression on me: Isaac Asimov's Robot Dreams, John Varley's Press Enter,  Walter Jon William's Dinosaurs, and George R. R. Martin's Portraits of His  Children.<br />I could probably write an essey that would be longer than the  story about Asimov's Robot Dream.  It is a dlightful return of Susan  Calvin, one I wasn't aware of.  It also continues the theme Asimov has had  in his last decades, of the thinning difference between the human and the  Robot.  It isn't as full as 'That Thou Art Mindful of Him'  or 'The  Bicential Man', and Susan Calvin lacks her passion for Robots, but it is  fascinating anyway.<br />I've read John Varley's story about 5 years ago, and  I thought it was one of the best short fiction pieces I've ever read.  It  is every bit as good in the second reading.  Varley writes a tale that is  even more chilling today, in the days of internet, than it was in the 80s.   He proves he understands History, Computers, Medicin - but most  importantly, character.<br />Walter Jon William's Dinosaurs was an incredible  surprise.  I've read some of Williams's Wild Cards stories, and I've liked  them well enough, but Dinosaurs is one a whole new class.  It is a story as  powerful as any SF short fiction, a real classic of the field, imaginative  and page turning.  Williams has immidiately become and author to watch out  for.<br />And than we come to George R. R. Martin.  I'veleft his story for  the last, and so I'll also talk about it at the end.  Martin is my favorite  living author (Asimov is probably my favorite all time author, though it's  a close call), but every time I get to read one of his stories, I think  &quot; It can't probably be THAT good&quot;, and yet, it allways  is.<br />Portraits of His Children isn't a Science Fiction story - it is a  Dark Fantasy/Horror story, but it is no less powerful for that.  It is  clever, unique, and most of all, touching.  It has won its Nebula  deservedly.<br />Those were my favorites, but they don't have to be yours.   Greg Bear wrote a kick ess story about micro-aliens.  Octavia Butler wrote  a Hugo award winning tale about a post-apocaliptical world that is a place  familiar in tone to all Butler fans, myself included.  C.J Cherry(sp?)  wrote POTS, a unique Space Opera tale that was the first of her works I've  read, but surely not the last.  And Orson Scott Card finishes the book with  a story about the future of Civilazation - where the world might be  different, but people aren't.<br />This is a unique anthology.  I read all of  it in record tim, and enjoyed it tremendously.  It truly has some of the  best SF stories out there - Viva the Eighties.	2000-07-28

This is a chalanging book, and reading Dark Water's Embrace may be  a good idea (I know I intend to), but itis powerful, and  rem inds me n ot  only of Ursula K Leguin, b ut also of Orson Scott Card's Speaker for the  Dead  and Octavia Butler's Exogenesis Trilogy.<br />I won't spoil much of the  book,otherthan to say that it recounts a story of the clash of cultures,  with no Heroes and Villans, but real people and aliens, men and women and  mid-males (and one super cool computer called Ghost), who try to fight for  the good of their people.<br />Leigh's a  great, under rated book, and this is  a great, underated book.	2000-07-17
US	51630889	R2U3AXSM88BFTQ	0553282530	16747248	Ace in the Hole (Wild Cards)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	All His Puppets	There are three points about Wild Cards 6: Ace in the Hole, which perhaps make me unfairly biased against it.<br />The First is that this is a Mosaic Novel, meaning that there are lots of authors, each writing a short part (  between a few paragraphs to a few pages, usually), and than leaving the  stage for someone else.  I'm not particularily fond of this form of  story-telling.  I don't think it does justice to the author's  abilities.<br />The second Problem I have with 'Ace in the Hole' is that the  outcome is not one I approve of.  I don't like the ending because the  characters I wanted to win, didn't.<br />The third problem is really personal.   This is the first WILD CARDS book without anything by George R. R. Martin.   Martin is my favorite living author, so I think it's a shame.<br />Thus maybe  someone who doesn't have all these problems will like ACE IN THE HOLE  better than I did.  Although, to be sure, I liked it quite a  bit.<br />Basically it's the stroy of Puppetman's attempts to get elected as  the Presidency Candidate for the Democratic party.<br />The other characters  find out that Puppetman is an ace, and than they attempt to stop him from  winning.<br />We have a pretty great collection of authors here.  Stephen  Leigh leads as the best of the bunch, writing Puppetman.  Close behind are  Melinda Snodgras with Dr. Tachyon, and Walter J Williams tellling us about  the Judas Ace, Golden Boy.  I wish the Golden Boy parts would have been  written in the first person, like 'Witness' in the first WC book.  The  other two authors are Simon who reintroduces us to Demise ('don't look into  his eyes' goes the WC gingle), and Victor Milan who writes the weakest  bits, about Sara Morgenstern and Mackie Messer.  Morgenstern was great when  written by Leigh, but doesn't work nearly as well in other hands, and  Messer was a character I never understood or wanted, and this book proves  that he wasn't really necessary.<br />Overall, the book is well written, and  pretty fast paced.  Some scenes are great, many are interesting.<br />But it  has problems.  The most obvious is the exessive amount of Sex.  The WC  books have never shied away from Sex, but this is rather absourd.  People  seem to be falling into each other's... well... I don't know... well, ALOT.   Exessively.<br />I don't want to explain the plot much further.  It's pretty  well handled with all the viewpoint characters etc, although there were  some things left I didn't quite understand.  Maybe there'll be further  explanation in the volumes to come.<br />Three Short notes.  If there's  something you can't say on the universe of the Wild Cards, is that things  have no consequences.  They have lots of them.  The Status Quo was  dramatically changed in this book, with a major secondary character in the  WIld Card universe discarded of off screen, and a life changing experience  to Gregg Hartmann and possibly to Tachyon.  The future should be  interesting.<br />Second note is Tachyon.  Tachy's tale returned to the realms  of the Soap Opera with this book. He's getting way too much of the  limelights, and it doesn't help him.  I hope we'll get a little less from  him, so that we'll miss his character a little more by the next time  Snodgras returns to him.<br />And final note, if you're reading the Wild Cards  Series, and want to discuss it, please email me.	2000-06-24
US	51630889	RVJEWW0TNQLUJ	0446359203	629572192	Carrion Comfort	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Great writing, fine plotting, but looooooong	I haven't read anything by Dan Simmons since The Rise of Endymion, over 6 months ago.  I decided to read Carrion Comfort in an impulse - I was curious as to how good his horror will be.<br />in the first 300 pages I was  enchanted, and I asked myself frenzily &quot;How come I haven't read  anything by Simmons for so long?&quot;<br />by page 400 I knew the answer.   Because it's sooo loooong.<br />Now don't get me wrong, Simmons is a hell of a  writer.  Many scenes in this book are really tense.  The characters are  vary between ok to great (most of them),and no stickers.  The action is  often exciting...<br />But there is so much of it!  around page 350, Simmons  starts a huge sub plot about a gang war and a haunted house(kind of).  The  subplot doesn't really go anywhere, except that it kills a bunch of people,  and substitutes them with some other people.<br />Simmons is the writer most  need of an editor that I know of.  This could have been a Thriller  masterpiece.  Had it been 700 pages long, it would have stood there next to  'Red Dragon' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' by Thomas Harris.<br />Rather it  is 992 pages long( british mass market paperback), it's a really good book,  and a one that you would enjoy reading.  It has some minor flaws other than  the length, but it is really well done.  It has the spookiest chess scene  I've ever read, and quiet enough original ideas to keep this a truly  original Thriller.<br />Dan Simmons wrote a Science Fiction masterwork with  Hyperion, and now he came very close to writing a thriller masterwork.   That's quite an achievement.<br />If you're looking for a good  horror-thriller, with some mind candy and lots of action and obscenitites  and sex, this is a great choice.	2000-06-16
US	51630889	R3K8M1KE2X29DC	0553573357	487389793	Blue Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A Science-Fictional Utopia	One must truly admire the men and women in the Hugp convention, who chose to give this book the Hugo award for best novel.  I'm a long lasting science fiction fan( the kind that get notious everytime someone calls I,  Robot 'Sci-Fi' and that shudders to the sight of movie tie ins).  I've had  my disagreements with the Hugo award decisions, of course, but I had the  notion that I knew what they were looking for.  Now I know I don't.<br />I  honestly don't know what the common, plot oriented reader can truly get out  of Blue Mars.  This is not an attempt to grude against the novel, but  simply a statement - people like me, who like plot oriented tales, who like  characters which are -I can't seem to find the word:  passionate, perhaps,  or passionly written - well, I don't think you'd find this kind of thing  here.  I'm certain even the most faithful fan of this book won't call it a  page turner, and won't discuss the brilliance of the plot.  As for the  characters, I personnal cared but for few of them, Sax, Nadia, maybe even  Michael and Ann.  I still feel that the most fascinating characters - John,  and to a greater extent Frank and Andrey(sp?) - were terminated before  their time.<br />It is a subjective statement, I admit, but one that I think  is shared by many.  Sure, avid fans might ignore it rushly, but I do think  the great amount of people who find the characters less than appealing  indicates something, not so much about the quality of the writing but of  the author's intention.<br />This is not, as one could think, a Novel of  ideas.  I do not have the background to challange Mr. Robinson's  speculations about physics, chemistry or biology, but at least the economic  theory Robinson proposes is shallow, a collection of phrases and slogans  and mixture of philosophies that creates the world he envisions.<br />I think  this might be the secret for Robinson's success.  For if Ursula K Leguin's  The Dispossed was an ambigious utopia, this is a mysterious, science  fictional one.  I think Mr. Robinson created the future as a land of hard  science fiction - where it is science fiction, not science, that transforms  the world.<br />In the Foundation trilogy, Asimov's imaginary science  revolutionizes the world, but the science is never exposed in details.  In  the Mars trilogy Robinson created a science fictional science, and a  science fictional Utopia - a world that is changed by the fictional  creation of a science.<br />I think I can see how this is appealing to the  hard core science fiction fan.  The creation of not only the universe in  which the science change the world, as Asimov did, but also of the science  itself.<br />Alas, this vision is not my vision, and the book, an ode for this  science fictional science, is not one I can truly enjoy.	2000-05-23

Intelagent, witty, smartly constructed and plotted, DOG is Willis's best tale. Willis is one of the few Authors, who not only use the first voice narration often, but also uses it well.  At her writing, the  characters come to live, as they battle their way through the brilliantly  realised Victorian England.<br />There are a few complaints, however - at  points, its accessive, when Willis tries too hard to go for humour.  The  ending, although clever is a little bit of a cheat.<br />Small Potatoes.  This  is one of the greatest Time Travel novels I've ever read.  The only one  that's quite as good is Isaac Asimov's The End of Eternity.<br />Willis at her  best is quite close to Asimov at his best, and that's possibly the ultimate  complement an SF author can recieve.	2000-04-27
US	51630889	R3MHCL087NRBZF	0553274635	587990232	Down and Dirty (Wild Cards, Book 5)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	The very best Wild Card, so far	Down and Dirty is, in my humble opinion and only so far, the best WILD CARDS book.  To start with, it has the most impressive cast list:  Pat Cadigan, Stephen Leigh, Melinda Snodgras, Walter Williams, the acclaimed  Roger Zelazny AND my personal favorite, George R. R. Martin.<br />   Mind you,  not all is swell.  We get an undesired cameback from Leanne Harper and  edward Bryant.  Any reasonable person who has read the series must learn to  dread those two.  Atleast we got rid of Lewis Shiner for this one, although  I far prefer his Fortunato to the dreadful Bagabond and to Rosemarry and  her straight out of a bad movie mobster friends.<br />    So what did they  have in plan for us?  Well, the bad stories include newcomer's Cover tale  of Leo Barnett or whatever his name is, the priest whose name in ACES  ABROAD raised as many cries of outrage as McDonalds would in a French  restaurant.       The story is quite bad, and Barnett is an annoying type  who is not the material of great villians.  Harper's story isn't quite as  bad as some of her other stuff, and Bryant resorrects Buddy Holly - yeah,  that one.  I'm a moderate Holly fun, and a big Rock fun, so I survived that  story.<br />  OK, now for the good stuff.  A quarter of the book takes place  between the end of Wild Cards 3: Jokers Wild, and the end of WC4: Aces  High.   While Tachy and company are abroad, the main plot line is of the  gang war between Kien's bunch and Rosemary's mobsters.<br />  One of the  reasons this is such a great story is that it completely devided to  stories:  no less then 5 authors(Martin, Snodgras, Miller, Harper, and  even, to my great surprise, Zelazny) - half of the contributers - devide  their stories into sections.<br />The first quarter sees Rosemary's secret  revealed (who cares?), and gives us great new insight to Croyd, the  Sleeper.  If the first Croyd story was tragic, and the second, Ashes to  Ashes, comic - then this is about the dangerous side of Croyd Cressen, or  asthe the Aces Jingle( isn't that a cool idea?) goes:  &quot;sleeper  waking, food taking/ sleeper speeding, people bleeding&quot; We also see  cameo appearences by Demise, Bludgeon( I thought he was dead), and later  Golden boy( I wish he was dead).<br />In the second quarter, the aces return  from their around the world trip, and we get some cute stories.  Cadigan  and Leigh follow stories from Aces Abraod.  Cadigan tells us another tale  fo Water Lily, focusing on Hiram Worchester, while Leigh continues the  adventures of Kahina and puppetman.  Leigh is one of my favorite WILD CARD  authors, and if his piece here isn't as good as his previous one, its  because he can't really push too much.  The story involves Chrysalis  discovering Puppetman's true identity, while he's running for presidancy.  <br />  In the last half, occuring all during one month, we see new plot line,  introduced briefly earlier:  a new version of the Wild Card virus. This  allows for some of Snodgras's best story telling, as she writes her best  story since Degredation Rites.  Some plotlines I though were drearly,  namely Tachyon's grandchild - seem to flurish under her capeable hand.<br />I  still miss the enigma of Tachyon when he has been first introduced. I fear  he has become too well known, lost his mystery.  I would have liked some of  the excitment back.<br />The two plotlines ar resolved in a rather nice,  subdued fashion, that tells us that there will be consequences.<br />But let  us not forget George R. R. Martin's All The Kings Horses.  We have a return  to the Great and Powerful Turtle - a return of sorts, at least, as Tuds  goes through somewhat of a mid life crises.  The turtle is an enormously  difficult character to write for ( which is probably why Martin only wrote  three stories abouthim so far) and Martin uses him to exploar realities of  life - as well as the question 'What is it really like to be a superhero?'	2000-04-27
US	51630889	R3OGBHQSZOVR1X	055327628X	355529242	Aces Abroad (Wild Cards, Book 4)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	An International Wild Card Novel	Aces Abroad is exactly what the title says - American Aces going outside of the US.  A delegation of Aces, Jokers, and Nats( all in a Boeing 747 names The Stacked Deck), goes abroad to see the situation of aces outside  the US.  They go to South America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe -  in short, a 'round the world' tour. After three books that focused on the  US, the much needed international perspective to the story was finally  given. Perhaps the highlight of the books was the return of Greg Hartmann,  masterfully written by Stephen Leigh.  I really liked Leigh's Strings in  the first Wild Card book, and his story here, is every bit as well written,  and if it isn't as tense, that's a fault of the narration, not opf the  author - but wait, we'll get there. Other things worth mentioning - for the  first time we get a Joker perpective.  Both the continous Journal of Xavier  Desmond, and John Miller's story, have an Joker narrater(Des and chrytalis,  respectively). We also get answers to several nagging questions - about the  Huge Ape with the passion for Blonds, about Tachyon's past, and best of all  - a little more information about the Envoy.  Priceless. The average level  of story telling was rather high.  I thought there were only 1 stincker in  that pack - Down in Dreamtime, a terrible story about Jack the Aligator  Man's niece.  I must admit I forgot her name. Ok, but what's wrong witht he  books? The greatest complain is the lack of real plot.  We get basically  adventures.  The Stacked Deck arrives at a country, bad stuff happends.   then it arrives at a new country, and a new aqdvanture starts.  There's  little feeling of a continuous story, despite some attempts there.   Especially bothering is the fact that at the end, all the stories seem to  be about Terrorists.  That was somewhat of an overkill. Tachyon, for one,  becomes annoying.  I won't spoil anything, but he turns out more and more  annoying.  Snodgrass writes a nice story about him, butI don't like the  direction they're taking the character. A Final complaint is that George R  R Martin doesn't write a story for the book, but only the journal of  Desmond, which isn't good enough for a Martin fan like me. Overall, this is  a strong volume.  Not as strong as ACES HIGH, maybe, but stronger then  JOKERS WILD and then WILD CARDS.  If you like the wild Card series, this is  a good addition.	2000-03-17

I thought him to be a quite a good writer, but I simply haven't read anything by him I loved.  I read a few short stories, and 'Foundation and Chaos', and they  were all good, but nothing to addict me.<br />Alas, neither was  &quot;'Darwin's Radio&quot;<br />But don't let that stop you.  Darwin's Radio  is certainly worth reading.<br />I'll start with what I didn't like.  The  characters, while all different, didn't seem all that interesting.  The  only one I really cared about was Christopher, and to a lesser extent Saul.   They were different and came alive.  Bear spent alot of time about the  rest of the characters, especially Kaye and Mitch, but I never cared for  them, or for the romance.<br />The other main complain, is that there really  isn't too much of a plot.  The book is marked as a Techno thriler, but  there really isn't any action or advature.  The characters are more or less  passive spectators, watching Sheva, speculating about it, and trying to  survive the catastrophes the world throws at them.  In a sense, there's no  story here.<br />OK.  Then why should you read the book?  Simply, because the  ideas behind it are mind blowing, and well explained.  Yeah, sometimes I  was lost in the science, but I truly enjoyed Bear's scientific imagination.   Bear does something that science fiction rarely does - he expands  scientific ideas, and he should be commanded for that. Also, the book  deserve notice for Bear's ability to make the scientific method, and the  scientists, not only comprehensible but also fascinating.  The tensest  moments of the novel are scientifical exchanges of ideas and theories.  At  its best, you read with wide eyes as characters present incredible ideas,  that seem strangely likely.	2000-03-13

Each tells the story of one character: Melinda Snodgrass -roulette and her attempts to murder Tachyon. Leanne Harper - the Bag lady, bagabond Walton  Simons - Demise, the black queen who survived Lewis Shiner - The annoying  Fortunato, pimp in an endless quest against all sorts of things. John  Miller - Wraith, a thief who can moce through walls. Edward Bryant - Sewer  Jack, an Aligator man who's a friend of Bagabond. and, the highlight of the  book, as well as most of the others: George R R Martin - tale o Hiram  Worchester, the owner of the acclaimed ACES HIGH, a true anti  hero.<br />Basically there are two plot lines - Wraith steals a note book from  Kien, a minor villan from Wild Cards 2 and 3, and lots of characters get  involved in the attempt to reach them.  This is a 'McGavin' of the worst  kind, though there are some nice twists to the tale, and after all this is  a parody of Comic books. The other plot involves the Astronomer, who  summoned TIAMAT in ACES HIGH.  He wishes revenge on all the aces who  attacked his Mason in that book. All these events happen during 'Wild Card  Day', September 15, when NYC is filled with Jokers, Aces and tourists, and  Hiram Worchester puts a huge party in 'Aces High', his restaurant( not to  confuse with ACES HIGH, the second wild card book).<br />sound interesting?   Well, it is, but it's also really confusing.  Written by 7 authors, it  follows 7 different tales, and they don't combine into a single one all too  well.  Oh, it's often exciting, but its difficult to follow, especially as  some of the writers( Martin, Snodgrass), are far more powerful then some of  the others( though they aren't the only talented ones, of  course).<br />Another flaw of the book( a complain, rather), is that none of  the main repeat characters are favorites of mine.  I've loathed Fortunato  from the moment I've first read of him, and while he improves occasionally  here, he's not someone who's tale I particularily enjoy.  But at least his  stories feature the cool Astronomer( A true Comic villan, though I would  have liked him to interact with the heros a little more) and other aces.   Sewer Jack and Bagabond deal only with each other, and with equally dull  and bizarre DAs and Mobsters.<br />Overall it's nice but I don't see the great  varriety and uniquness of the first 2 books.  Its neither a dark tapestry  of interesting, if uneven stories like WILD CARDS, or a comics book with an  edge story like ACES HIGH.  Its just a highly readable, if disjoint, action  novel.<br />I liked it, but I hope the next ones will be better.	2000-02-27

It is a magnificent story, and an addicting one at that.<br />Unlike the first Wild Cards book, Aces High is a tightly written tale, following some threads to their end,  more or less.  It means that, generally , the individual stories are less  note worthy( with the exception of the remarkable &quot;Winter's  Chill&quot;and the half comic &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;) but the overall  quality is high.<br />The book introduces us some new heros.  the most  entertaining of them are Jube, an extra terrestrial who knows more jokes  than anyone else around, and Kid Dinausaur, a boy who can change into any  dinausaur he wishes, thought they're always tiny.<br />We have some new  villans, only hinted to in the first book.  It is more of a comic book than  the grim first volume.  The writing seemed to have risen, and it is, all by  all, a much more entertaining tale.<br />A special notice deserves George R R  Martin.  After writing the frankly disappointing 'Shell Games' in Wild  Cards, Martin returns in full shape with a remarkable, touching story.  Winter's Chill is the story in Aces High most resembling the WILD CARDS  town, and is also the best.<br />If you can find this, BUY IT	2000-01-23

I am a great admirer of the Late Doctor Asimov.  The man had an incredible talent for clear, effective writing, and incredible ideas.  Usually I find his non fiction to be atleast as effective and as inspiring as his non  fiction. However, this is not the case with his Guide to the Bible.<br />Don't  get me wrong... Asimov achieved everything he set up to do.  he exploars  the 'real' espects of the bible.<br />However, that is not what I find  interesting in the bible.  to tell you the truth, I don't care about the  origin of every name, and about the places in which each event took  place(Asimov does not, in my opinion, stresses enough the fictious nature  of the Bible).  I'm more interested in the moral and ethical points of the  bible, and in its history.<br />In the book, there are some interesting  ancedotes and facets about that.  However, those are hidden between pages  on pages describing the places and names, etc.<br />If that's what you're  interested in, this is the perfect book for you.

Too many of the stories don't work.  Some, like Witness, are bad, while many (maybe most) seem to be a  beginning, setting the stage without solving anything. ( that is especially  true of stories like ' The long night of Fortunato')<br />Also, there are to  many characters, and the story isn't focused enough.  It covers thirty  years, but most of the time its not very vivid.  The early stories, at  least, all feature Tchyon as a main character, but then he disappears, and  that's a shame.<br />Now for the good part.  <br />First, the intervals are  great.  Especially the one summing up the red scare, and the one with the  quotes.    <br />Also the one with about the science behind the wild Card  virus.<br />Then we have the premise, which is great.  The world, and many of  the characters, seem fascinating.  I love the wild card virus.<br />Also,  three of the stories are simply exellent. Those are, Sleeper, by Roger  Zealany, Strings, by   Stephan Leigh, I think, and especially, Degredation  Rites, by Mellinda sondgrass, which is a touching, tragic love story, as  well, as a powerful political tale.<br />The best thing about the book,  though, is the great promise it contains.  It thrills me, and I'm sure I'm  gonna love the next books.	2000-01-03
US	51630889	R12F1OC6VFBJBP	0886778174	702249100	The Reel Stuff	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Overall, real Good	OK, first I shall say it was a strange pick of stories.  where was 'Sentinals' Arthur C Clarke's story that inspired 2001: A Space Odyssy? And why are there no less then five Horror stories in this collection( Mimic,  Second Variety, Sandkings, Candyman and Reanimator?)<br />But it was,  nonetheless, a great collection.<br />Mimic was short, but interesting.   <br />Second Variety was cool, even if it wasn't really surprising and had a  cheat ending.<br />Amanda and the Alien was better then the movie, but that  doesn't say much.<br />Sandkings is a stroy by one of my favorite writers  George R R Martin, and was the scariest thing I've ever read.<br />We Can  remember it for you wholesale was very cool, and very different from Total  Recall, too.<br />Enemy Mine was prety cute, if obvious.<br />Air Raid was  intriguing but not all that unique, reminded me a little of stephen King's  The Drawing of the three.<br />Johnny Menemonic, by william gobson, was  terrible, boring and totally uncomprihensible.<br />The forbidden was Ok, not  great.<br />Martin's second entry, Nightflyers, was extreamly cool, almost as  good as his first, defnetly a classic, even if it was a little similar to  2001.<br />So go buy it, 'Sandkings', 'We can Remember it for you' and  'Nightflyers' each is worth the price of the book alone.	1999-12-17

The first book was interesting and a good read, if also flawed.  Alas, the second is a huge disappointment.<br />Pretty much all that was wrong with the first book is  wrong with the second one as well. Very important is that NOTHING happends.  Except for one 'big' event, that is supposed to be shocking even though it  was refered to a million times, the situation remains pretty much the same  as it was in the first book.<br />Everything is very repetitive.  We have  millions of battle scenes, which get old quickliy.  We get needless  descriptions of sex, we get a really bad soap Opera sub plot( more on that  later), and we get endless alien bitching about hwo &quot;Chaotic&quot;  humans are.  It was OK the first book, but now it's terrible.<br />The worst  thing, are the characters.  now we have no less then three ex baseball  players as heroes.  Compare that to soldiers(2), scientists(1), resistance  fighters(1-2), pilots(2) politicians(1)... way too much baseball.<br />But the  worst thing, and the very reason I stop reading this series despite all the  good things I said about it in my review of the first book, is Sam Yeager.   I just can't stand him.  He's simply the worst, most annoying charicature  of a character, the brainless brawn that saves the day and gets the girl.   I hate his character so much it alone would have been enough to make me  desert almost anybook, no matter how good. <br />Fortunately or unfortunately,  this isn't a great book in the first place.	1999-12-11
US	51630889	R20JUP7D0CZJUU	0345388526	512051457	In the Balance: An Alternate History of the Second World War (Worldwar, Volume 1)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Really cool concept, overall good, but flawed	I've heard about Turtledove for a while, but this is the first of his books I've read.<br />Overall reaction - it was good, well written, I liked the characters(especially Jager and Russie) and the man defnetly knows his  history.<br />BUT...<br />There are lots of little things.<br />The alien society,  for example, is written in such a 'tailored' way it's a litte annoying.  To  be able enough to cross light years they have to be really powerful, but in  order to lose to the humans they have to be very restricted.  Turtledove's  alien society answers these craterias well, but does it perhaps too neatly.   there's a great deal of tension lost because it seems like the aliens are  the underdogs.<br />And while the cast IS interesting, we could have avoided  some of the clische's - all the americans are great(they are), all Nazies  who play a significent roles are not racist and non fascists, etc,  etc.<br />There are also far to many inside Science Fiction jokes, which makes  it harder to suspend disbelief - comments like &quot;Alien invasions are  not the same as they are in 'Amazing Stories'&quot; may be realistic, but  they make it hard to take the story seriously.<br />Also it was sometimes too  slow, we didn't get enough of the Strategy( as oppose to the tactics) and  gthe ending wasn't a really succesful Cliffhanger.<br />Still, I enjoyed the  book's many positive traits, and I would recommand it to anyone.	1999-11-19

Martin tells a brilliant, strong and  powerful tale, and tells it extreamly well.<br />The only problme is that the  first one hundred fifty pages are kinde' slow... but it picks up and is  alot of fun.  The ending was very touching. <br />Don't miss Martin's greatest  creation, A Song of Ice and Fire	1999-09-19

Since I believe most of the people here have read some of these, here goes: Asimov's Foundation  Triology still holds as the very best of science fiction ever written, in  my not so humble opinion.  However, All the sequels, with the possible  exception of Prologue to Foundation, were ****.<br />Frank Herbert's Dune - I  tried to read a sequel, but couldn't.   <br />Dauglas Adams's Hitch-hiker's  Guide to the Galaxy , as great as it was, added multiple of unnecessary  books too tire even Ford Prefect enthusiasts.<br />and perhaps the most  relevant, ORson Scott Card created Ender's Game, and a reasonable sequel,  Speaker for the Dead, only to ruin them by two more barely readable  books.<br />Given the repartoir, Simmons's work was the best of the bunch.   Hion and Fohion are amoung the greatest books ever written, sci-fi or no  sci-fi.  And the Endymion books?<br />Well, Endymion was alright.  It was two  hundred pages too long, but still had lots od cool scenes, even if it was  kinde'standard.<br />RoEion was much more ambitious, and for the most part,  better.  RoEion had  enough good characters, smart moments great lines, and action, to make up  for it and retain it's ground a relatively worthy part of the Hyperion  Cantos.  Had it not been for the great two Hion books, Eion and RoEion  would have been considered very good science fiction.  The only problem is  how they pale in comparison to the first too.	1999-09-01
US	51630889	R2FMDV3UNZO3CW	0553573403	268067011	A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Time to Stand	OK. This is were I react.  The writer before me is certainly losing it, as well, as the woman who bitched about not havng stron female characters.<br />Martin created the most incredible cast of characters, male  and female, to have ever apeared in a fantasy book.  Catelyn is a stron  female character, and so is Dany,and Arya.  Someone who doesn't think they  are probably will consider Pilar from 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' a weak  female character.<br />As for likeable characters, it's true that a few  likeable character die, but that's life.  You have plenty of cool heros  left, most notably Tyrion Lannister.  If you feel bad about characters  sying, Martin has done his work properly.<br />As for childlish, well it's  true that about half of the character sare children, so they act childlish.  Like DUH.  But there are lots of grown ups, and they never act  childlishly.  Catelyn and Tyrion's battle of wits, Ned's search for Robert  Arryn's murderers, Jon Snow learning about loyalty - all are simbols of  growth and greatness.	1999-09-01

It's been years since I've read any AD&amp;D books, and in retro perspect, only few of them stand out - RA Salvatora's Homeland, ElfShadow, and both of Golden's ravenloft books that I've read,  The Dance of the Dead and this one.  It's a very good book, one that can  compare favorably with 'real' Fantasy and horror.  I'd take Golden over  Rice every day. This one is way better then 'An Interview with A Vampire'	1999-06-05

I thought it was smart, action oriented, and with cool characters.  One problem, though.  I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.<br />I re read it as an adult(18, not 78) or rather , tried to re read it.  The silly, sexist and obvious  book might as well have tagged the characters with GOOD and EVIl in huge  capital letters, cause it's so obvious which one is which.  The book is so  lean on making the hero great that it's insulting.<br />Still, I gave it 2  stars, cause if you're 13-14 you might like this book.	1999-06-05
