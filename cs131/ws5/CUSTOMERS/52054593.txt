When Papa Delmonico passed away, his wife, Estelle, unable to manage the shop alone with her arthritis, closed its doors and retreated to her home at the edge of town. The shop remained empty for many years. The paint faded and chipped. The plastic cloths melted into the table tops. Dust gathered on the floor and the windows grew dim from disinterest.  <br /> <br />The Aminpour sisters were forced to leave their native Iran and need to make a new life for themselves. The oldest sister, Marjan, turns to what she knows best-cooking-and decides to open an Iranian Caf. Fate and family connections bring them to Ballinacroaugh, a town that sits at the base of the mountain where St. Patrick prayed, fasted and blessed the people of Ireland. Traditions run strong and deep in Ballinacroagh. When this trio of mysterious dark skinned women drive into town in an old hippie bus and re-open the former Pastry shop as the Babylon Caf, tongues start wagging. <br /> <br />Marsha Mehran's debut novel is astonishing for a new writer. She delivers the thoughts, motives and emotions of her characters with the crisp pungency of a Middle Eastern bazaar. I can't remember when I last felt compelled to read a book in a single sitting, but I absolutely could not put it down. I vow that I will rush to get on the waiting list for the next book by this talented author. <br />	2005-10-11

She is independently wealthy, has two well-adjusted adult children and lives in a ritzy high-rise downtown Washington D.C. apartment worthy of Architectural Digest. Although she spends her days experimenting with new recipes, napping, sipping martinis, cleaning her extremely tidy apartment and wafting about in her favorite white gown while thinking about sex, she tells herself and her family that she's not bored, that her life is absolutely perfect, just as it is. <br /> <br />Then one day she hears a voice in her head, a voice that tells her that a murder will be committed in her apartment building within 30 days. The voice also says that she has the power to prevent this murder.  <br /> <br />Anne confesses this unusual event to Mary, a stout, ebullient African-American woman who works in the building as a cleaning woman. She doesn't clean Anne's apartment since Anne loves to clean, (a passion that I cannot begin to understand) but her position does give her access to and knowledge of many of the residents. Anne and Mary each decide that one of the top candidates for murderer of the month is a suave, handsome thirty-ish Russian gentleman. Mary's investigative techniques involve eavesdropping and observation; Anne follows her overactive libido and decides to sleep with him.  <br /> <br />I vicariously enjoyed the many martinis imbibed throughout the novel, as this is my Friday end-of-workweek drink of choice. But my absolute favorite part was the secret passage, a device rarely used in an adult book. It took me back to my pre-teen years when I passionately read dozens of \\"girl running away from castle\\" books. <br /> <br />If you are looking for light entertainment and you aren't wedded to a particular genre preference (I couldn't quite figure out whether this book was a romance with a dash of mystery or a mystery with frivolous flings), pick up a copy of My Very Own Murder. To enrich your overall experience, I suggest you dress in your most comfy \\"I feel good about me\\" outfit and apply a chilled martini on your lips.	2005-10-10

Geneva manages to get away from him via a fire escape and runs out onto the street. There, she breathlessly tells her waiting girlfriend about the attack and they use a cell phone to call 911. While the police are investigating the crime, the attacker shoots the librarian who assisted Geneva with her project. It becomes quickly apparent that rape was not the true motive for the crime and the police suspect that Geneva is still in danger. Quadriplegic investigator, Lincoln Rhyme, becomes involved in the investigation and uses his team of people and his high-tech tools to try to figure out the attacker's motives as the man attempts to kill Geneva again and again. <br /> <br />I'm fairly burned out on reading serial killer books, but this one is a bit different. In this book, the killer serially attempts to kill the same person-although he does leave other bodies in his wake. Previous Lincoln Rhyme books have emphasized the personal life of the investigator more than this particular novel does and that background is important to understanding how he works. I would suggest reading one of the earlier books in this series if you haven't read any before. <br /> <br />Some critics have said that the extensive use of African American Vernacular English was distracting and difficult to read. I listened to the audio version of the book and found that George Guidall's narration easy to follow. <br /> <br />This was a good book-not great, but the many plotline twists and Geneva's likeable character kept me interested right to the very end.	2005-10-08

The only other book that I read by this author was the Da Vinci Code and I read that just to see what all the fuss was about. Far from being a one-hit-wonder, Dan Brown seems to consistently write novels with timely plotlines and fast action.<br /><br />In Deception Point, NASA discovers a meteorite with astounding scientific implications deep in a glacier in the Arctic. Scientists and civilians from a variety of backgrounds are called in to verify the findings and help announce them to the world. U. S. President Zachary Herney is grateful for this find for political reasons; without NASA's discovery his chance of re-election looked pretty slim.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Senator Sedgewick Sexton is hatching plots to gain the presidency for himself. Since much of his campaign platform centers around dismantling NASA and privatizing the work of this government agency, he has a lot to lose from the discovery of the meteorite. But all is not as it appears to be for either the President or the Senator.<br /><br />The plot is as thick as the glacial ice in the Artic, but the action never freezes.  Pick this one up if you're in the mood for political intrigue.	2005-10-05

I found out that was a big mistake and that I really shouldn't judge a book by its cover. The Secret Life of Bees reminded me of To Kill a Mockingbird in both topic and style. It is bound to be a Summer Reading classic of the future for teens.<br /><br />The book takes place during the early civil rights movement and the central character is a 14 year old white girl named Lily Owens. She lives with an abusive and emotionally distant father on a peach farm in Georgia. Lily is a very lonely young lady whose only friend is the family's black maid, Rosaleen. One day, Rosaleen puts on her Sunday best and walks into town to register to vote, a new privilege for black Americans. Lily goes with her, just to get off the farm for a while. When they arrive in town, Rosaleen is accosted by some white men intent on causing trouble. When she spits out her snuff on their shoes, she is beaten and arrested for assault and then beaten some more. Lily gets caught up in the trouble and is hauled off to jail with Rosaleen. Lily's angry father gets her out of jail and then hands out his own unusual brand of punishment.<br /><br />Lily is now more determined than ever to get away from her father. She breaks Rosaleen out of her guarded hospital bed and the two of them set off for the town of Tiburon, South Carolina, a place that she knows only by a name scratched on the back of a picture of a Black Madonna that her deceased mother once owned. When they arrive in Tiburon, they stop for lunch at a local store. There, Lily sees the same Black Madonna picture on jars of honey. The store owner tells her that the honey is made here in town and gives her directions to the home of August Boatwright, a beekeeper. August and her sisters take Lily and Rosaleen in. Soon, all of their lives intertwine and they begin to affect each other.<br /><br />Merely describing the plotline doesn't do justice to this fine novel. The voices of the characters are distinct and each has a unique story to tell. Sue Monk Kidd is a master story teller who manages to weave facts about history and beekeeping into a novel that is told with perception and sensitivity.

I figured that reading a light fantasy in the land of adult make-believe would be just the thing to do. It had been years since I read a McCaffrey book, but I had an image in my mind of what I imagined it to be like. It turns out that the book wasn't quite what I expected it to be: it was better. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the book the reader is introduced to a race of people in an unexplored galaxy far, far away. One particular family's spaceship broke down and stranded them in the midst of their people's dreaded enemy. Facing torture and murder for themselves and their child, the parents decide to commit suicide. But before they do, they try to save their infant daughter by putting her into a deep sleep and launching her into their life boat pod. Eventually, the pod is found by a trio of men; rough but good hearted asteroid miners. Initially forced to take care of her by fate, they become her stalwart guardians. They name her Acorna and raise her as a foster child. <br /> <br />Acorna grows up to be a fetchingly beautiful young lady, albeit one with a horn in the middle of her head. The horn has curative powers and Acorna is also blessed with uncommon good sense and charisma. She uses these talents to assist a mogul in his quest to do good. <br /> <br />This is the first in a series. I hope that the others are as complex and entertaining as this one. Acorna turned out to be a much more interesting character than I expected. The three miners also have unique storylines to follow in the future.	2005-10-05

At least that's what her distracted, chain-smoking mother, Helene, says. When Amanda's Aunt and Uncle want a little bit more attention paid to Amanda's disappearance than Helene does, detectives Gennaro and Kenzie agree to take the case. When they start digging around for clues, they find themselves surrounded by disreputable characters, drugs, money, filth and dead decaying bodies. <br /> <br />This book is not for the faint hearted. <br /> <br />I read Mystic River a few years ago (before they made the movie) and loved it. Lehane's writing style is uniquely suited to depict the gritty reality that made Mystic River memorable. I picked this one up in my local bookstore (it came highly recommended by the store's owner) and took it on vacation with me. I found that Lehane's style is evident in this book, too, but not quite as fully developed. Perhaps I've read a few too many books in this genre lately and need a change, but about three quarters of the way through, I just wanted it to be over. I peeked at the end of the book and was fully satisfied with the conclusion. That was good enough for me. I will watch for Lehane's novels in the future-when I'm once again ready for gritty, hard-edged, well-written stories.	2005-10-05

Although there are certainly a few of the usual gentle mysteries to solve, the emphasis is on Mma Romotswe's life.  <br /> <br />In this story, the reader finds Mma Ramotswe dealing with several crises. She is trying to track down the whereabouts of an elusive thief; she nearly hits a cyclist and gets involved in his life; her abusive ex-husband arrives in town; one of Mr. J.L.B Matekoni's apprentices quits in a fit of anger and her precious white van breaks down. <br /> <br />I've listened to the entire No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency on CD. Narrator Lisette Lecat creates the most perfect voices for this story. I've enjoyed this series much more than I expected to. I found the characters thoroughly engaging and was amazed at how the writer could make ordinary daily occurrences seem so utterly fascinating. Along the journey through this series, I also learned about life in Botswana, a place that I know I will only visit as an armchair traveler. If you haven't tried any of the books in this series, I highly recommend that you start at the beginning as each book in some way builds upon the previous ones. <br />	2005-09-21

When estate appraiser, Faye Travers discovers the drum found in the attic of a deceased client, she does something that she's never been tempted to do. She steals it and seeks out its rightful owner. When she finds the family of the man who initially crafted the drum, she hears the story of how it came into being. She comes to understand how the drum itself may have compelled her to act on its behalf. <br /> <br />Louise Erdrich is a verbal artist. Through her carefully crafted prose, I could smell the dust rising from the prairie, hear the wind rustling the grass and feel the texture of the drum. The Painted Drum gives us a snapshot into the lives of people who must reconcile tradition with reality. <br /> <br />This was the first novel I've read by this author. At times, the story came vividly into focus and was quite engrossing. At other times, I found it difficult to maintain a firm grasp on the story as it was told by the various characters. However, overall, it left a mark that won't soon be forgotten.	2005-09-17

They pretty much all follow a predictable formula. Innocent victims fall prey to a highly intelligent sociopath who had childhood issues and the cops/FBI use a variety of means from psychics to cyber systems to catch him.  <br /> <br />Dexter is a bit different. He is a highly self-aware sociopath with murderous moods who works as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami police department. His impulses are controlled through years of instruction and a strict set of rules-he only murders other serial killers.  <br /> <br />In this novel, Dexter's carefully crafted world is in danger when another serial killer starts a murderous spree on Dexter's turf. The second killer mimics some of Dexter's techniques and begins to taunt him by playing macabre jokes that aim suspicion in a direction that Dexter would like to avoid. <br /> <br />Dexter narrates his own story, which allows the reader to really get into his head and see the world as he sees it. This is an amusing point of view, as Dexter is for the most part, aware of his own shortcomings and has learned to be content with what he is. We see the foibles of the humans in Dexter's life through the eyes of someone who finds normal emotions somewhat amusing. <br /> <br />I listened to the audio version of this book. Nick Landrum, the narrator, had a voice that absolutely was designed to be Dexter. While the alliteration got a bit old by the end of the novel, the freshness in approach to a rather stale sub-genre made the book entertaining and engrossing.	2005-09-17

Cussler has managed to reincarnate the aging Dirk Pitt through Pitt's twin children, Dirk and Summer, much to my delight. Dirk Pitt senior, while something of a male chauvinist, was a charming, daring character who made men flex their biceps vicariously and attracted women like a power magnet. When Cussler created the younger, more politically correct character, Kurt Austin, he managed to drain the life out of his stories. Austin didn't have Pitt's charisma and his adventures were rather predictable. <br /> <br />With Black Wind, Cussler is back into his old form. When unexploded Japanese bombs from World War II are found at the bottom of the ocean, Dirk and Summer get into a mini-submarine and begin the careful extraction process. Just as they are about to complete this dangerous task, some rogue Korean bad guys attack the NUMA vessel, lock the crew in the hold of the sinking ship, steal the bombs and kidnap the twins. NUMA is now engaged in a race against time to rescue their crewmen and stop the bad guys from doing dastardly deeds. <br /> <br /> With any luck, fans of the Dirk Pitt novels will be able to look forward to more adventures of Dirk and Summer, as Clive Cussler's son, Dirk Cussler is now co-authoring the books with his father. <br />	2005-09-14

I eagerly read each of the books in the series for the next few years. As the novels progressed through the alphabet, the reader got to know the main character, Kinsey Milhone. Kinsey works as a Private Investigator in a small fictional town in California. Her various cases brought insights into Kinsey's past and present. <br /> <br />Then right about \\"K is for Killer\\", Kinsey developed a dark, brooding side. While I expected Kinsey to be multi-dimensional, I was a bit taken aback at finding depressing characteristics in one of my favorite escapist characters. I approached the next few installments in the series with a bit more caution. Oh, I read all of them, but I no longer expected them to be light entertainment. <br /> <br />I put off reading \\"R is for Ricochet\\" until I started seeing previews for \\"S is for Silence\\". I shouldn't have waited so long. The old fun loving, daredevil Kinsey is back (although she seems to be taking a break from any actual detective work).  <br /> <br />Kinsey accepts a job as a transporter/babysitter for the adult daughter of a rich invalid. She picks the woman up from prison, spends some time with her in exchange for her 500 dollar a day fee, and discovers that she actually likes her. Of course, her new friend, Reba, didn't end up in jail for nothing, and soon Kinsey is dragged into various misadventures. I did wonder if Kinsey threw common sense out the window along with her overactive angst, but the story was so much fun that I tried not to think too hard about that inconsistency. <br /> <br />\\"R is for Ricochet\\" is a good book for anyone already familiar with the series-good, not great-but definitely a lot of fun.	2005-09-01

After accidentally killing a deadly boneblight, he is knocked on the head by pirates, who think he'll be a fine warrior. (The pirates, of course, didn't know that Wick didn't try to kill the boneblight; it was run over by a wagon while he was running from it.)  <br /> <br />Soon after capturing Wick, it is clear to the pirates that they made a mistake. Wick is consigned to the galley and spends his days washing dishes. However, Wick's experience as a librarian and lover of myths, fables and fiction comes in handy when the ship is attacked by an Embyr. Wick uses his knowledge to negotiate the situation. The pirates are pleased to have not been reduced to floating ashes that they promote him to full-fledged pirate. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Wick rescues himself and his compatriots from dangerous situations by applying the knowledge he acquired in the ultra-secret Vault of All Known Knowledge. In Wick's world, librarians are the only things standing between civilization and utter barbarianism. <br /> <br />As a librarian who likes fantasy novels, I was just enchanted by this light, fun adventure. I've already started the sequel, The Destruction of the Books. While this series might not always appeal to hardcore fantasy fans, it would be an excellent book to recommend to young adults who want something to read after they've gone through Tolkein, or adults who are new to the genre.	2005-08-22

After finishing the book, he said that he thought I might like it. I'm very selective about the non-fiction I read, but drinking wine is one of my favorite pastimes, so I gave it a try. <br /> <br />The book chronicles the process of producing a California Fume Blanc wine from vine to table. The author's selection process narrowed his winery choice down to the Ferrari-Carano winery in Sonoma County. He felt that this mid-sized winery typified the process for the California wine industry.  <br /> <br />Through interviews and observations, the author lets us get to know the people involved in the process-from the Mexican workers who tend the grapes to the top level staff and winery owners. From reading this book, I got the feeling that the final product is as much the result of the personalities involved in the process as it is the idiosyncrasies of the grapes, climate conditions and soils. <br /> <br />I felt that the writing was a bit uneven, but to be fair, as a fiction reader, I am used to being able to maintain speed and pace while I read. I did learn a lot about the California wine industry from Weiss's book. Wine itself carries an air of elegance and prestige that masks the work that goes into it. About ten years ago, I spent a day harvesting grapes for a local Maryland winery. That single experience changed my perception of the process. This book added more details that make me more fully appreciate the nectar of the gods.	2005-08-22

In typical chick-lit fashion, Katie Chandler has an ogre for a boss. He turns into an absolute monster at the slightest provocation. The communal workspace where she has her desk is the most bleak and dreary space in the entire building. Her co-workers (the ones that didn't quit the job immediately) are more interested avoiding work than being productive. When Katie demonstrates initiative, one co-worker glares at her as she blows on her still drying nails. <br /> <br />But the company that Katie works for is anything but ordinary. For one thing, her boss really is part ogre. Katie was recruited away from her old job for a much better paying position as an immune at Magic, Spells and Illusions (MSI), Inc. It seems that the corporate magic world likes to play tricks on each other as much as the mundane business world does. Because of Katie's absolute immunity to magic, she can see through the spells that the folks in the magical world use to trick each other.  <br /> <br />On Katie's second day on the job, she catches a corporate spy who used an invisibility spell to gain access to the building. Her talent (or rather lack of talent) and initiative get her noticed and promoted. She gets to leave the depressing common workroom and gets her own office, complete with a door and window. Katie is on her way up in this company. <br /> <br />Shanna Swendson's book is full of characters that are as fanciful as they are innately human. Like Katie, you learn to look past the pointy ears, wings and stony exteriors of her co-workers and learn to see them as just, well, people. You cheer Katie on as she struggles with her love life and subway traffic in the midst of folks who can cure either problem with a potion or a spell. The characters in this book are so good that they deserve a sequel. I was delighted to read that the second in this series, Once Upon Stilettos, will be released in May of 2006. Highly recommended for lovers of chick-lit and Harry Potter.	2005-08-16

When a balloonist in distress is spotted in the vicinity of the Aurora, Captain Walken takes advantage of Matt's light weight and agility to help reel the stranded balloon onto the Aurora. A critically ill old man, rescued from the balloon, is taken to the ship's infirmary. When Matt visits him, the man asks him if he saw \\"them\\" and describes some heretofore unknown winged creatures.      On the Aurora's next voyage, Matt meets an adventurous young lady, Kate de Vries, who is on a mission to find these mysterious winged creatures. The old man in the balloon was her grandfather. He left a logbook behind that described the creatures and pinpointed their location. When pirates attack the airship, events are set into motion that put Matt and Kate into life altering experiences.    Kenneth Oppel has created a high-spirited, swashbuckling adventure.

I haven't read gothic novels since I was a young teenager; I thought I'd revisit the genre. <br /> <br />The plotline is quite simple. An adoptee learns that she is really an heiress and heads off to claim her fortune. When she arrives at the stately mansion in Connecticut that is her newly inherited home, she discovers quite a cast of characters. There's the gorgeous chauffer who chases rich women, the chauffer's mentally ill sister who repeatedly buries a baby doll, the sickly sweet but secretly sinister aunt and uncle, the silent boy and his dog who wander the grounds and the physically deformed chess player who never comes out of his room.  <br /> <br />But not everything is quite as it seems.  <br /> <br />While most of the book is mildly entertaining, the last few chapters will make you feel like you've just seen a horrific accident. If you listen to the audio book in the wee hours of the morning, don't plan on going to sleep during the final cassette. <br /> <br />	2005-08-08

Multibillionaire Howard Christian loves nothing better than spending money to fulfill his own fantasies: he drives a fleet of antique cars that would make Dirk Pitt salivate; he lives in a high-tech observation tower in New York; he has his finger on the button of his own personal ultimate defense weapon. Christian is now interested in cloning, but he doesn't want to clone sheep, cows or grandma's favorite cat: he wants to clone mammoths. When an amazingly intact mammoth is found in the far frozen Canadian north, Christian sends his chief henchman, Warburton, to investigate. What he discovers surpasses even Christian's fantasies. <br /> <br />Next to the frozen mammoth is a frozen, gray haired man. From his clothing and weapons, it looks like he died while trying to stay warm next to the body of the mammoth. But when Warburton notices that the man is wearing a wristwatch, he calls his boss, who quickly arranges to have the entire find whisked away to his climate controlled warehouse. Then they discover the time machine and the fun really begins. <br /> <br />Reading Mammoth is like a spending a day in a Pleistocene-themed amusement park. The characters and settings Disneyesque and the mammoths are just so darned cute. Turn off your reality sensors and have some fun.  <br />	2005-08-03

It is a world where children are engaged in guerilla warfare. It is a world where America doesn't pull all the strings. It is a world that is like a hall of mirrors; a fun house without the fun; a carnival where the roller coaster drops endlessly down, down, down. Grimwood lets the reader into this world one step at a time, with blinders on. Facts are revealed slowly, and sometimes out of sequence, creating an off-kilter feeling. I've never read anything quite like it. <br /> <br />Chief of Detectives, Ashraf Bey, finds that his knowledge of both sides of the law is essential to performing his duties.  His unorthodox methods of crime solving and his personal habits are a source of amused consternation for his superior, General Pasha. Pasha tells him, \\"...as Chief you have three main problems. The first is personal. The way life works is public virtue, private vice. You keep doing it the wrong way round.\\" Even the corrupt General recognizes the way things should work; even if he, too, fails to follow the law. <br /> <br />Bey's one anchor, and my favorite character in this otherwise dark world, is his niece, Hani. Her sense of humor allows us to see another side of Ashraf Bey. Precocious, intelligent and clairvoyant Hani assists her Uncle in surprising ways as he works to discover who is murdering female tourists.  <br /> <br />Although this book is the second in a series, it is easily read as a stand alone book. While not to my taste, this novel is well crafted and is recommended for anyone who likes cyberpunk, speculative fiction or alternative histories. <br />	2005-08-03

Like many other women of her time, she served as a nurse in the war, doing what she could for her country. She saw men experience the physical and psychological effects of battle and never be quite whole again. She saw her friends' families suffer shock and loss as they received telegrams about their sons, husbands and fathers.  <br /> <br />Maisie, too, is scarred by the war. She dreams of blood and dying men. She is haunted by the fate of her ex-lover who is too shell shocked to recognize her. In this book, Maisie must face some of the demons in her past. <br /> <br />While assisting the police in the interrogation of a young girl accused of murder, Maisie is approached by a client who is required to fulfill the terms of his deceased wife's last wishes. The client asks Maisie to find his son, who was lost in the war, that his wife believed was still alive. The client, however, wants to prove that his son is deceased. To do this, Maisie will have to go to France and re-live some of her memories of the war. When she talks to her best friend, Priscilla, about her upcoming travels, she asks Maisie to see if she can find out exactly what happened to her brother, Peter, since Maisie is already doing one investigation in the area. She reluctantly agrees to take on both cases. <br /> <br />As the investigations progress, it is clear that someone doesn't want Maisie to complete at least one of her cases. Maisie is in danger, but it isn't clear which case is the cause of the threats on her life. As she digs deeper into all of them, she finds that nothing is quite what it appears to be. War can be the catalyst for subterfuge in even the closest of relationships. <br />World War I brought new opportunities for employment and self-improvement for many women who needed to fill roles previously held by the men lost in battle. The author does an excellent job of portraying what life was like during anera that was full of pain even as it held new opportunities. Maisie is a warmhearted, likeable character who takes a humanistic approach to problem solving.  <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended for anyone who likes mysteries with an intelligent, insightful protagonist and historically accurate atmosphere.	2005-08-03

But in this case, looks can be deceiving. Go ahead and pick it up. You won't be able to put it down.  <br /> <br />In the prologue, a young girl sees a fairy floating in the murky canal that runs through the town. But of course, the reader knows that it's a really a dead body. This gives the reader a sense of omniscience about the outcome of the missing woman. Sometimes this ruins the fun in a mystery, but Kate Pepper creates such believable, interesting characters that you just keep hoping that you're wrong. <br /> <br />The story is told primarily through the eyes of Alice Halpern, a happily married woman with two children who is now expecting twins. It is her pregnant friend, Lauren, who is missing. Alice and Lauren are just part of a very close circle of friends who enjoy backyard barbecues and play dates with the kids. When Lauren disappears, the suspicion eventually falls on a very powerful person who may have a reason to want to make Alice and her unborn children disappear, too.  <br /> <br />The police take a very keen interest in this case and a female detective is available to Alice at all times of the day and night. Since this story takes place in Brooklyn, New York, I found this to be a rather questionable phenomenon. But this book has such engrossing plotlines that I was willing to forgive a little uncharacteristic behavior. <br /> <br />This would be a fantastic book to take someplace where you have a long, boring wait. The time will just fly by. <br />	2005-08-03

A thoroughly unpleasant woman, Delores is in league with the equally unpleasant minister of magic, who would like nothing better than to discredit and fire Dumbledore. Throughout the school year, Delores puts a stranglehold on the school, creating rules and regulations that forbid just about every fun activity. When she refuses to allow the students to practice defense against the dark arts magic in or out of the classroom, Harry and his friends organize an illegal group they name Dumbledore's army. Secretly, they practice the magic needed to defend against Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Good thing, too, as they will need these magical skills sooner than they would like. <br /> <br />While this was not my favorite entry in the Harry Potter series, it was still quite entertaining the second time around in audio format. I didn't like the way the Sirius character developed in this book. I thought Harry could have used a more mature role model. Dumbledore was absent throughout most of this book while Hogwarts fell deeper and deeper under the control of someone he greatly disliked. Although supposedly he was busy with the Order of the Phoenix, I thought that this was out of character for the school's headmaster. The whole story could have been a bit tighter. There were many scenes that really weren't necessary to support the story line...unless of course, they are needed for the final two installments. <br /> <br />The latest book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was obediently sitting on my desk at work, waiting for me to get back from vacation. I'm looking forward to starting it this very evening.  <br />	2005-07-23

Box's testosterone laden mystery takes place in a small town in Twelve Sleep, Wyoming. Joe Pickett, the new game warden, can't begin to live up to his predecessor's mythic reputation. When Joe's gun is taken away by a drunken citizen shortly after his appointment, he has an even harder time gaining the respect of the local hunters. When the same drunken citizen arrives mortally wounded in the middle of the night, frightens Joe's daughter, Sheridan, and dies in the woodpile in his yard, Joe finds himself in the middle of a very unpopular investigation. Suspects and motives add up to serious trouble for Joe's family and the townspeople in Twelve Sleep. <br /> <br />I picked this one up because a review of C. J. Box's latest book, Out of Range, noted that this author won several awards for books in his Joe Pickett series. At first, I was a bit put off by the he-manly exploits of the characters as they hunted and grunted like backwoods cretins. But I kept all those awards in mind, and stuck with it. About halfway through the book, the rewards for persistence paid off. This book is highly recommended for anyone who likes mysteries with woodsy grit and action.  <br />	2005-07-06

Harry, Hermione and Ron are young teenagers in their fourth year at Hogwarts. Relationships among the three friends get much more complex as Ron becomes moody, Hermione finds her first boyfriend and Harry has a crush on a girl. These everyday problems add totally new dimensions to the dangers Harry faces from Lord Voldemort and his cronies.<br /><br />As usual, someone is out to get Harry and this time the dangers are very, very real. When his name is entered illegally into the Goblet of Fire, Harry becomes one of four champions who have to compete in the tri-wizard championship. The champions face possible death from dragons, drowning and creatures in a maze in their quest for the championship cup. Indeed, one of the champions doesn't survive the final trap set by Lord Voldemort.<br /><br />Unlike Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, this book is not for the very young. It has some very dark, scary moments. However, it is well written and highly entertaining for anyone who has grown up along with the series. There are enough references to the other three books to advise the reader of connections, without boring those who are already familiar with the characters and plotlines. Four and a half stars.	2005-07-06
US	52054593	R2U48TUH4TNQM8	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	5	8	14	N	N	So much for harmless librarians...	The Historian uses references to historical facts, folklore and literature to create a vivid and very human portrait of Dracula. Although versions of vampire stories date back to ancient Egypt, the source of most modern vampire lore comes from the legends surrounding Vlad the Impaler. When he wanted to make a point, he would impale the heads of those who displeased him on stakes. These stakes would be displayed very prominently to discourage rebellion.  <br /> <br />In the first part of the novel, the story is told primarily through the eyes of a young girl. In her father's study, she accidentally found an old letter addressed to \\"My dear and unfortunate successor\\". Slowly, she gets her father to reveal the background for that letter. As the novel progresses, the reader gets increasingly caught up in the story as it is told by her father through the letters from his mentor and his own search for Dracula as a younger man.  <br /> <br />The author manages to weave historical facts through the fiction so deftly that it is hard to separate them. There are references to Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" side by side with bits of  texts on ancient parchment. The vampires in the book have very human qualities and even Dracula is portrayed as a character of many facets. <br /> <br />Because of my own profession, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the many scenes that the characters spend pouring over books in libraries redolent of leather, paper, dust and wax. The descriptions of the evil librarians made me smile and consider my own canine teeth.  <br /> <br />Buy this book and read it in the middle of summer, while the sunlight streams brightly through your windows. Once the days darken early and the harvest moon hangs low in the sky, you'll be fearfully checking your favorite reading table for a copy of the dragon book. <br />	2005-07-05

As a child, she played \\"magazine office\\" and dreamed of becoming the shoe editor at a high-fashion magazine. When she is hired as the assistant to the assistant of Issues magazine, she feels like she has fulfilled a lifelong wish. But Chloe has to learn to be careful what you wish for. Her boss also has unfulfilled fantasies that Chloe inadvertently steps in; her co-workers are more interested back-stabbing than working. When the office prince charming shows an interest in Chloe, things really begin to heat up. <br /> <br />This book makes me really, really want shoes-all those kicky little bits of shiny leather that look so pretty on a long thin legs. As Chloe goes into raptures in the shoe closet, I imagine rows of store windows in trendy shopping centers where shoes are displayed under lights designed for diamonds. My eyes linger just a moment longer than they should on that red pair with heels that would make me trip and fall on my nose. <br /> <br />Let me set the record straight: I am not a shoe person. My husband disagrees with this statement as he trips one of my eight pairs of black, sensible shoes that I've left in the middle of the closet floor. But when you're on your feet all day, you can't have too many pairs of sensible shoes. Sigh. What I'd give to be able to wear what Chloe does. <br /> <br />As Chloe innocently negotiates the emotional minefields around her, she vacillates between being a babe in the woods and an astute observer of human nature. In the third of the book, I found it difficult to get a handle on Chloe's true character; her essence was as elusive as a will will-o'-the-wisp. In one moment she doesn't understand the slang term \\"chick\\" and in the next she's caught a spelling error in a letter from her boss. She comes up with original marketing ideas without understanding what the promotions department does.  However, as the book progressed, I began to really like Chloe and I forgave her flaws.   <br /> <br />Stephanie Lessing's book is easy to read and hard to put down. Her characters speak to any woman who has ever played pretend as a child, shopped to relieve stress, anguished about her beauty flaws or dreamed of finding the perfect man. I hope to see more from this talented new author. <br />	2005-06-29

It was fun every time.<br /><br />I read this and the other four Harry Potter books published to date before, but decided to listen to them as a refresher for the upcoming new title, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.<br /><br />Even though the story was familiar, it was just as entertaining. This first book in the series has a delightfully fresh quality to it that makes it very appealing. In this book Harry finds out his family origins, gets to Hogwarts Academy, makes some friends and has his first battle with his nemesis, Voldemort.  Even though the school year comes to an end at the conclusion of the book, the reader knows there is more to come. There are still conflicts brewing in the background of the story. Five stars.	2005-06-26

The Invisible Thread, written for young adults, is an autobiography that tells of her life before, during her family's internment in a camp in Utah. <br /> <br />Although her parents were Japanese citizens, Yoshi and her sister were born in the United States. They were as American in their speech and culture as the Swedish family next door to them. Yet, because of their appearance, they faced discrimination even before the war. The American government violated the Japanese Americans' constitutional rights when they removed them from their homes. The conditions under which they were forced to live were deplorable. <br /> <br />The author chose not to dwell on the horrors of that period of her life. Although she clearly describes their relocation and the stable and barracks they lived in, her emphasis is more on family life and the positive things they did to keep their lives as normal as possible. She does a fine job of describing her own confusion, her loyalty to her family and friends and her loyalty to the government that betrayed them. <br /> <br />This book is on our local school system's 2005 Summer Reading List. With the current backlash against Arab Americans, this is an important book for children to read. It is only through education and tolerance that we have a hope of avoiding past mistakes.	2005-06-26

It is Harry's second year at Hogwarts. The author does an good job of refreshing the reader on the essentials of the storyline from the first book, without belaboring them. Harry has his usual share of troubles with the Dursleys and can't wait to get back to school. However, someone or some thing is turning students into stone. To protect the students, the teachers enforce strict curfews and cancel Quidditch games. They may even have to end school early so that students can be sent home for their own safety. But Harry dreads being sent back to the Dursleys and that makes him more determined than ever to find out who has opened the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing the menace that is petrifying students. The sense of danger heats up even more when one of Harry's friends is attacked.<br /><br />The reader, Jim Dale, does an excellent job of portraying all of the voices. Check out his website for insights into how he creates the voices for the characters in the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />I liked the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a little better than this one, but that was primarily because I felt that part of the ending was a bit too contrived. Four and a half stars.	2005-06-26

To prepare for the class, we were asked to read something in a genre different from our usual fare. Since I'm pretty much all over the map, this was a challenge. However, up to this point, I've avoided Chick-Lit. I consulted a co-worker who does read these books and asked for a recommendation and got this book. <br /> <br />What a delightful surprise! The book was engaging and well written. The characters were very real and you didn't have to be twenty-something to relate to it. This book would appeal to women of all ages. <br /> <br />Candice Shapiro, a young reporter for the Philadelphia Examiner, suddenly finds her humdrum life thrust into the limelight when her ex-boyfriend starts writing a column for a popular women's magazine. His topic--their love life and what its like to be romantically involved with a \\"larger woman\\". Throughout the book, we see Candice struggle with her sudden, unwanted notoriety as she also balances her romantic yearnings, food cravings, and family challenges. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. Five stars. Now that I've broken the chick-lit barrier, I'm willing to keep an open mind in this genre.	2005-06-26
