What are the duties of the Christian life?  What are the privileges of the Christian person?  How does my faith in Christ affect my day-to-day living?  My outlook on life and the world around me?  J. C. Ryle answers these questions with his characteristic (but uncommon) wisdom, certainty and plainness.  It is no mistake that this volume of his practical divinity (the others being `Holiness,' `Knots Untied' and `Old Paths') carries a subtitle that begins `Being Plain.'  If Ryle is anything, he is plain.  He is straight-forward, sincere, honest and eminently practical.  Ryle just plain makes sense.  His interpretation and application of the texts are impeccable.  He makes Christian theology and the practice of heart-religion seem so simple and obvious and beautiful that I sometimes wonder what Bible I've been reading all these years to have missed so many beautiful truths!<br /><br />Ryle speaks to both common and uncommon subjects in this volume.  Prayer, Bible-reading, and attendance at the Lord's Table are duties which are well-known to every professing believer.  His treatment of `Zeal,' `Formality' and `Sickness,' however, are bound to make the nominal Christian more than a little uncomfortable.  Ryle speaks to the heart and soul of every man. He wields the sword of the Spirit like a skilful surgeon, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow.  His sword strikes true and cuts deep-especially to those whose religion is a matter of practice and not a matter of the heart.  It is clear that the title `Practical Religion' does not speak of a formula for mere religious action (nothing was more abhorrent to Ryle than heartless religion), but of those acts which are done by those whose faith is a way of life.<br /><br />Christian, read J. C. Ryle. You will not regret it. He is a man who first and foremost loves the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the vital center of all his teaching and writing and the sole reason for his great power in ministry. Whether you are an erudite scholar or a hard-laboring farmer, a pastor or a layman, a spiritual elder or a babe in Christ--no matter where you are--Ryle's writings are for you. The love of Christ and the faith of this great 18th century saint cling to every page like an aromatic perfume.  He is quickly becoming one of my very favorite writers.  I have no doubt he will win a place in your heart (and your bookshelf) as well.<br /><br />Here is a brief quote from one of my favorite chapters to whet your appetite: `Perhaps you have thought that if a man's religion is correct outwardly, he must be one with whom God is well pleased.  You are completely mistaken.  You are rejecting the whole tenor of Bible teaching.  Outward correctness without a right heart is neither more nor less than Pharisaism.  The outward things of Christianity,--baptism, the Lord's Supper, Church-membership, almsgiving, and the like,--will never take any man's soul to heaven, unless his heart is right.

Ryle is quickly becoming one of my favorite Christian writers.  This book is, quite simply, THE BEST single work on the Christian life I have ever read.  Ryle's insight is phenomenal, his exegesis is impecable and his humility is stunning--and all of this while maintaining one of the simplest, most approachable, most readable styles of any theologian ever.  I was hesitant to pick up a book written by an 18th century Anglican (particularly one I knew virtually nothing about), but my hesitance was by no means merited.<br /><br />Ryle speaks to the heart and soul of every man.  He wields the sword of the Spirit like a skillful surgeon, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow.  He addresses hard and trying subjects which most modern evangelicals have chosen to ignore: the power and depth of indwelling sin, the necessity of a holy life, the struggle and fight of faith, counting the cost of following Christ... and that's only in the first 5 chapters!  'Holiness' is one of four volumes of what has been called Ryle's body of 'Practical Theology.'  Each of these volumes is infinitely worthy in its own right, but 'Holiness' stands just a little taller than the rest.  It is unique, not in its content--for Ryle's message is the message of scripture--but in its simplicity and singleness of focus.<br /><br />Ryle just plain makes sense.  His treatment of the texts which head the chapters is based on plain interpretation, common-sense exegesis and practical application.  As he is fond of saying when interpreting plain-as-day passages which are often twisted and confounded by scholars and skeptics, 'If words have any meaning at all, then this is what the passage says.'  But what is more astounding is that he does not side-step the difficult issues.  Instead he takes them head on, making Christian theology and the principles of holy living seem so simple and obvious and straight-forward that I sometimes wonder what Bible I've been reading all these years to have missed so many beautiful truths.  Christian, read J. C. Ryle.  You will not regret it.  He is a man who first and foremost loves the Lord Jesus Christ.

Their names are in the baptismal register.  They are reckoned Christians while they live.  They are married with a Christian marriage service.  They mean to be buried as Christians when they die.  But you never see any \\"fight\\" about their religion!  Of spiritual strife, and exertion, and conflict, and self-denial, and watching, and warring, they know literally nothing at all.

The facts are all there (I hope), but the author's psycho-analytical comments on Wesley's relationships with women and subtle (and often not-so-subtle) mocking of John Wesley's characteristics, beliefs, choices and friends served to undermine the historical narrative rather than to support it.  I hesitated in giving this book a 3-star rating, because it is (sadly) the best biography currently available on John Wesley.  To that end, if you are primarily interested in his life and the origins of the Methodist church, then you could consider this a 4 1/2-star book instead.  However, if you are interested in Christian biography for the sake of strengthening both your understanding and your spiritual fervor, this may not be the book for you.  I'd like to comment briefly on the distinctive areas that comprise (in my opinion) a good Christian biography.<br /><br />1) Historical Accuracy:  As far as I can tell, the book sticks to the facts fairly well.  If you have read Dallimore's biography of George Whitefield, you will notice that Tomkins' treatment of figures other than Wesley himself is somewhat lacking, but it is not the facts that cause the lack in this book.  History-buffs will find what they are looking for here as long as they can distinguish between 21st century commentary and the true historical account.  If anything, no one could accuse this biographer of candy-coating Wesley's life.<br /><br />2) Spiritual Character Development: Do we get to see into Wesley's heart and glimpse the passion for God that drove him forward?  At times you almost feel like the writer has accomplished this, but he quickly follows it up with discouraging, mildly-sarcastic statements that tear that feeling away from you.  This is particularly true in his insistence on contrasting Wesley's characteristics in early, mid and late life.<br /><br />The most disturbing point for me was in the discussion of Wesley's later life.  A rather depressive segment from a letter written to his brother Charles is quoted and taken as formative for Wesley's outlook through his entire life.  Any student of Christian history knows that most (but not all) great evangelists suffer from some form of depression.  Luther, Spurgeon, Lloyd-Jones, etc.--all of these men suffered at times from depressed spirits as a result of the great labor they put forth in declaring the word of God.  At this point the author makes you feel as though everything he's reported about Wesley's great evangelistic success and powerful preaching has been a fraud.  Overall a very disappointing portion of the book.<br /><br />3) Theology: The author brings out Wesley's theology and its development with some degree of accuracy.  I get the distinct feeling, however, that the lack of flow between Wesley's earlier convictions and later convictions was due to the authors own lack of theological understanding (or perhaps conviction is a better word).  He perpetually seems to be condemning Wesley's doctrine of Christian Perfection and at one point agrees with the conclusion that salvation is by faith AND works while deriding Wesley's views on the matter.<br /><br />4) The Author:  I guess, when it comes down to it, this is really where the book falls short.  Tomkins doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on Christian theology, much less Wesley's theology.  He takes great delight in applying Freudian psycho-analysis to Wesley's varied female relationships, seems overly skeptical of Wesley's conversion, comments sarcastically on many of Wesley's decisions and repeatedly suggests (according to human wisdom and modern psychology) how Wesley might have better managed his life and doctrine.<br /><br />Only in the chapter on his death and heritage is Wesley given much credit at all.  I would recommend this book to history-minded persons, but could not in good conscience recommend it to sincere evangelicals (particularly those of the Calvinist persuasion).  John Wesley is more muddled in my mind after reading this book than he was before.  I only hope the truth lies other than where Tomkins would allow it to rest.rsuasion).

This book is a 224 page condensation of the much longer, two-volume \\"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth-Century Revival\\".  I purchased this shorter volume for our church library and am already saving up the $66 to purchase the longer work for my private library.  I eagerly anticipate obtaining Dallimore's more exhaustive look at the life of this great evangelist.<br /><br />This Volume: First of all, the editing and reworking of the original for this edition was done by the author--Arnold Dallimore.  This is important due to the terrible chop-jobs professional editors are prone to perform on works such as this one.  But since I've yet to read the longer edition of which this volume is a condensation, I cannot draw any helpful comparisons between the two.  I can, however, say unreservedly that this is an amazing biography in itself.  Most modern readers aren't interested in wading through 1200 pages of historical details, even for a man as great as Whitefield.  Far more would be willing to pick up a well-written 200 page paperback concerning a name they might have heard mentioned, but know little about.  All in all, I very highly recommend this volume for this sort of reader.  But if you are an evangelical Christian (particularly of the \\"Calvinist\\" doctrinal persuasion) or a Church-history buff, then I feel compelled to recommend springing for the full edition.  With what this tiny volume contained I cannot but expect great things from the lengthier original work.<br /><br />The Subject Matter: Wow.  Simply wow.  I mean--who knew?  I'd always heard that John Wesley was the sole founder of Methodism.  In fact, the only thing I knew about George Whitefield was that he was attributed with a few neat quotes (ie. \\"Let the name of Whitefield perish, but Christ be glorified!\\", \\"I am weary in Thy work, but not weary of it\\", etc.) and that he once spoke at Jonathan Edwards' Northhampton church (at which time he left Edwards in tears).  I fully expect that if it were not for this work of Dallimore, the name of Whitefield truly would be lost to persons such as myself.  What I expected was another (Calvinistic) Wesley.  What I found was a man whose zeal, love, holiness of life and passion for Christ seemed to equal even those I hold in highest regard (among whom are Martin Luther and Charles Spurgeon).  Whitefield was a tireless worker for God and his zeal for the gospel was only matched by his selfless compassion for his fellow man.  He was the first of the great open-air preachers and nudged both John and Charles Wesley into evangelistic ministry.  Whitefield's life is a beautiful illustration of Christian ministry and evangelistic zeal.  I cannot recommend this man highly enough.<br /><br />The Author: Dallimore was a Baptist pastor and semi-prolific biographer.  The only lack that I see in this work compared with his biography \\"Spurgeon\\" is that it is more lacking in anecdotal stories and pastoral application.  This is likely due to the scope of the abbreviated work rather than to a change in style of the author.  It is a fast-moving biography and takes you quickly from Whitefield's earliest days into the midst of his phenomenal ministry.  Dallimore has done a superb job in this work.<br /><br />The Reader: Who should read this book?  I would recommend it most highly to pastors and other evangelical Christians whose zeal for God and spiritual wells have begun to run dry.  Evangelical Calvinistic Christians will get the greatest benefit from this read.  But it may also prove of great interest to those of the Methodist heritage.  Also, all who are called to the ministry of evangelism (teaching and preaching) could not but benefit from this work.  Whitefield's zeal is contagious and his meekness humbling.  The mere historian might enjoy the factual aspects of the book, but it was written from a distinctively evangelical Christian perspective.<br /><br />\\"Weary in Thy work, but not weary of it.\\"-G.

It is \\"the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes\\" (Romans 1:16).  This is a book especially for the strong in faith.

But I would not have you be dissuaded from reading Spurgeon's works just because they are not available in a format that the purists find acceptable.  Of particular note in this volume are two of Spurgeon's writings (not sermons, mind you, but writings) entitled \\"All of Grace\\" and \\"Faith.\\"  These comprise the first 180 pages of the book and are worth the price of the volume whether you care to read the re-edited sermons or not.  These writings individually would cost more than the price of this book, so it's really not that bad of a deal if you ask me.<br /><br />In particular, \\"All of Grace\\" is a most worthy and excellent book.  \\"Faith\\" reads almost like a supplement to this volume, focusing sharply on a critical, but often misunderstood subject.  It is my opinion that the former of these two is one of the single greatest non-canonical books ever penned.

He goes to great lengths to set forth logical and reason-based arguments for the doctrine of predestination, but often neglects the passages which speak clearly to the very points he is debating.  (For instance, Romans 9 isn't even touched on until more than halfway through the book).  Certainly his doctrine is founded in the teachings of scripture, but I longed for more direct application of the texts which teach predestination and more in-depth interaction with those which seem to be problematic for the Reformed view.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, therefore, only to those who are unacquainted with or uncertain of the doctrine of election.  Those who are convinced of the doctrine or who, like myself, willingly admit that it is taught in scripture but find the contrived interpretations of Shank and Geisler to be of little use, should consider this book only as a supplement to another more scripturally-centered book such as Luther's Bondage of the Will.<br /><br />Again, it is not that I feel this is a bad book.  It is, in fact, an excellent book, but it is not what I was looking for.  I needed a straight-forward exposition of the passages which speak of predestination--most notably Romans 9 and Ephesians 1.  I had hoped that Dr. Sproul would use these passages to set forth the Reformed doctrine of predestination.  He makes many good and logically accurate points, but I find that I cannot accept human logic apart from scripture.  Interestingly, what I felt was Sproul's best point seems to conflict with the style of much of the rest of the book.  It is found on page 12 in the middle of the autobiographical introduction.<br /><br />\\"YOU ARE REQUIRED TO BELIEVE, TO PREACH, AND TO TEACH WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS IS TRUE, NOT WHAT YOU WANT THE BIBLE TO SAY IS TRUE.\\"  Amen, Dr. Sproul.	2005-05-27

I cannot recommend this work highly enough. I rank this among the very best of Luther's works (and that is really saying something). If an inexpensive copy were still in publication I would buy every copy to give as gifts to friends and family. The power, discernment, brevity and readability of this work make a true gem among Reformation writings (and Christian writings in general). Here you will find the essence of the spirit of the Reformation distilled into a guide for practical, biblical living.<br /><br />With the clarity and bold authority of a true prophet, Luther sets forth the whole of the Christian life in two theses: \\"A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.\\" We are free from sin and the law (subject to none) but slaves to Christ in love (subject to all). As Paul writes in Romans 6:22, \\"But now...you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God.\\"<br /><br />Luther writes as a shepherd of the common people and the tone and content differ greatly from his better-known debate-oriented works (ie. Bondage of the Will, 95 Theses). The doctrine of justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone is the heart and soul of Luther's message, founded upon a firm conviction in the authority of scripture alone.<br /><br />He writes, \\"One thing, and only one thing, is necessary for Christian life, righteousness, and freedom. That one thing is the most holy Word of God, the gospel of Christ.\\"<br /><br />And again, \\"It ought to be the first concern of every Christian to lay aside all confidence in works and increasingly to strengthen faith alone and through faith to grow in the knowledge, not of works, but of Christ Jesus, who suffered and rose for him.... No other work makes a Christian.... 'This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent' (John 6:29).\\"<br /><br />And regarding our service to God, \\"...In this way the stronger member may serve the weaker, and we may be sons of God, each caring for and working for the other, bearing one another's burdens and so fulfilling the law of Christ. This is a truly Christian life. Here faith is truly active through love. That is, it finds expression in works of the freest service, cheerfully and lovingly done, with which a man willingly serves another without hope of reward; and for himself he is satisfied with the fullness and wealth of his faith.\\"<br /><br />I cannot personally vouch for this volume, but this treatise has been published in a number of other individual volumes and in at least one very worthy compilation entitled \\"Martin Luther's Basic Theological Writings\\" (ed. Timothy F. Lull, 1989) which also contains a number of other infinitely worthy works such as Luther's \\"Small Catechism,\\" the stirring \\"Meditation of Christ's Passion,\\" and the thesis chapters of the foundational \\"Bondage of the Will.\\"  I imagine this volume (if the binding and print are good) would be an excellent buy for someone looking for a cheaper, smaller alternative to Lull's massive tome.

He is not concerned with the various potential interpretations of \\"problematic passages\\" that fill the pages of other commentaries. From the very first page Luther cuts to the heart of the epistle-the doctrine of justification-in the way that only he can.

John MacArthur has produced a commentary series that is willing to take a firm stand on the plainly-stated word of God.<br /><br />You will not find \\"Dr. Dead-Scholars' 7 Possible Interpretations\\" of this or that verse.  You will not find literary deconstructionism or even an argument for canonical criticism.  You will not find meaningless word studies or pointless nitpicking over Greek tenses.  No, you will not find any of that here.<br /><br />What you WILL find is a thoroughly researched, well-written, insightful, sincere, biblically-founded and ultimately inspirational commentary.  Dr. MacArthur has dedicated his life to the study of God's word and this volume (along with the others in the same series) is the fruit of that life of faithfulness.  The book is dense, but rewarding.  It is theology and exegesis, not devotionals and anecdotes (though the book is peppered with plenty of both these things also).<br /><br />It is so refreshing to read a commentary that actually seems to take the Bible more seriously than whoever happens to be teaching at Cambridge or Princeton at the moment.  MacArthur's exegesis and interpretations are always founded solidly in the plain sense of the text.  Of the whole book I only took issue at one point where it seemed that Dr. MacArthur's theological framework had overshadowed the plain interpretation (this is in Romans 6:1-11 where he suggests that Paul was not referring to water baptism, but \\"spiritual baptism\\"), but this is a minor thing and does not effect a proper interpretation of Paul's argument in that portion of the epistle.  MacArthur, like Luther and Spurgeon before him, seems to have a gift for helping common folk (like me and you) understand the deeper things of God by opening to us the same scriptures we have read so many times but never fully taken hold of.  May God raise up more men like Dr. MacArthur in this day and age.	2005-01-18

Packer is an extraordinary theologian (arguably the greatest of the late 20th century) and this book is a distillation of the heart of his theology.<br /><br />The focus of the book is the attributes of God and how they shape the way He relates to us.  While you might be worried that the book will read like the second chapter of a systematic theology, you'll find no such dryness here.  Packer's writing is passionate and lively.  He discusses his Creator with the intimacy and excitment of a son talking about his beloved Father.  His discussions of God's wrath and the \\"goodness and severity\\" of God are particularly stirring (possibly because they are all but absent from the theological vocabulary of our post-modern churches).<br /><br />Packer is not content to objectively point out the attributes of God--instead he insists on making God's nature applicable to us as His creation.  This fervor for the relationship between creature and Creator naturally flows into the final section of the book--a discussion of God's wonderful plan of redemption through Christ Jesus and our adoption as sons and daughters of the Most High.<br /><br />His passion for the gospel and unwavering love for the Lord are highly contagious.  You may find yourself in tears while reading this book (either with sorrow or joy).  When I first read this book, God used it to teach me of the reality and significance of His divine anger toward sin.  Now I turn to it when I need to be reminded of just how precious I am in the sight of my God.  My only advice: read this book.	2004-08-23

This is an excellent resource for any Christian--whether your prayer life languishes or flourishes.<br /><br />One Caution: if you listen to Dr. Jeremiah's weekly radio program and thought to read this book as a supplement to the sermon series of the same name (Prayer, the Great Adventure), you should know that the text of chapters 4-10 (and parts of 1-3) are verbatim the same as the audio messages.<br /><br />One Exhortation: if you don't listen to Turning Point (or missed the series Prayer, the Great Adventure), READ THIS BOOK!

I was, unfortunately, sorely disappointed in what I found.<br /><br /> This volume is written by a dozen or so different authors, each of whom contribute a chapter to the book (actually an essay touching on the subject assigned to them). The various essays are then compiled, edited and presented in the form found here. While the theology is pretty solid overall, there are a number of significant problems with the book. I'll discuss the pros & cons of three particular areas and suggest helpful alternatives.<br /><br /> 1. Authorship: Because the chapters of the book are written by a number of independent authors there arise two significant concerns.<br /><br /> First, some of the chapters are well-thought out, compelling, and sound theologically while some are more disorganized, dry or left standing on a shaky theological foundation. This book screams for single (or even dual) authorship. In some places the writer of a later chapter attempts to build off a foundation that was improperly laid in the earlier chapters, and while their theology may be sound (and even substantially proven in classical theology), the result could be disastrous for the unlearned student.<br /><br /> Second, the authors spend a fair amount of space in some places recovering the same ground touched on by earlier chapters. This doesn't seem like such a big deal until you consider that they are attempting to cover the whole system of theology in only 700 pages! That doesn't leave much room for needless redundancy.<br /><br /> 2. Classic Theology: As with any true systematic theology, the bulk of the book deals with theology proper, christology, soteriology and ecclesiology. I have only one issue with this portion of the book.<br /><br /> While the treatment of classic theology (that which is not unique to Pentecostalism) is good and somewhat thorough, it is not nearly as excellent as most orthodox systematic theologies. The essays dealing with these subjects tend to rely upon the ideas of other theologians whose own writings deal with the same issues in a more compelling, precise, and thorough manner. I honestly feel like I'm reading a collection of essays written by seminary students on the various divisions of theological study instead of a genuine, comprehensive theologial work. If you're looking for a full system of theology, then you can do a lot better than this. I'd recommend the writings of Martin Luther (particularly his Commentary on Galatians) or the one-volume &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; of Wayne Grudem (a charismatic-influenced theology) as a better introduction to the fundamentals of Christian theology.<br /><br /> 3. Pentecostal Theology: A full quarter of the volume is taken up with the discussion of pneumatology (theology of the person and work of the Holy Spirit). I found two major problems with this section.<br /><br /> First, the pneumatology of the book is not fully integrated into the other areas such as christology and soteriology. With so many different authors writing there is overlap in places where there ought not be overlap and a lack of common ground in those places where it is most needed. What bearing does a pentecostal theology of the Holy Spirit have on salvation? On personal holiness? On the meaning and mission of the Church? Some of these questions are addressed, but not in a comprehensive manner. It's the difference between a genuine theme--an undercurrent of thought that guides and directs all other thoughts--and an afterthought. The earlier chapters may touch on the unique pneumatology of the Pentecostals occasionally, but the force of the theme is lost in the awkward break of the chapters. This is the primary reason I believe a single author would have done a much better job.<br /><br /> Second, the chapters on pneumatology, like all the chapters, read like individual essays instead of integral parts of a whole. These chapters therefore offer little that individual articles and books on Pentecostal pneumatology could not. Because the book is so segmented, the reader would be better served in studying another systematic theology and supplementing it with Pentecostal or Charismatic-influenced works. I would recommend Gordon Fee's &quot;God's Empowering Presence&quot; (or even the abbreviated &quot;Paul, the Spirit, and the People of God&quot;) or A. W. Tozer's &quot;The Counselor&quot; instead of this book.<br /><br /> Like the title of my review stated: good content, bad concept. I hope a solitary theologian (or even a group of theologians) in the charismatic camp will develop a better systematic theology in the future. Until then, look elsewhere.like all the chapters, read like individual essays instead of integral parts of a whole.

With piercing discernment, Spirit-led exegesis, and Christian love John MacArthur exposes the error of the &quot;cheap grace&quot; theology that plagues the church today. His analysis of Christ's words is the much-needed cure for the common misinterpretations of Paul which have led to antinomian teaching. This book is a response to those who &quot;distort [Paul's letters], as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction&quot; (1 Peter 3:16). The passion and understanding of this book far outmatch any other modern theological work you will come across. MacArthur adheres to the plain sense of the scripture and refuses to allow the words of Christ, apostle and prophet to be trampled underfoot by the anti-lordship teachers. His gentleness and kindness in dealing with those he argues against is admirable (Paul, Luther or Calvin would have verbally torn them apart). This book has been used by God to awaken many to the truth of Christ's undivided person--that He is both Savior and Lord. I pray He will use it even more in the years to come.	2004-08-06

These well-meaning, but woefully misguided teachers have adopted the strategies and tactics of Madison Avenue, baptized them, repackaged them and sold them to the modern church. The basic idea, however, is that pleasing the unregenerated masses is the only way to grow the church. While this in itself does not seem like something to fear, MacArthur demonstrates that when the Church's primary focus is on making the unbeliever comfortable the gospel message is inevitably lost. Uncomfortable topics such as sin, hell, discipleship and holiness are brushed aside and love and assurance are preached to the once-born, self-righteous, unregenerate masses!<br /><br /> Will God build His church, or must we? Will Christ save the souls of men, or has he given this greatest of tasks to mere men? Is there a Sovereign God in Heaven, or must we seduce the world into &quot;making a decision for Christ&quot; by appealing to their sensual, depraved minds? Sennacherib once again surrounds the walls of Jerusalem--the purity of the gospel and the souls of countless men and women are at stake. Where is the prayerful Hezekiah? Where is the bold Isaiah of this age? Arise, O Lord! Defend Your cause!<br /><br /> Note on Appendices: MacArthur's examination of the ministries of C. H. Spurgeon (Appendix 1) and Charles G. Finney (Appendix 2) alone is worth the price of the book.	2004-08-06

There are a multiplicity of theories on &quot;how to be filled with the Holy Spirit,&quot; but if you are weary of formulas and three-step approaches from this great mass of experience-oriented teachers then this book is for you. Tozer's understanding is firmly rooted in the holy scripture and is both fully divine and piercingly practical. Be drawn into the presence of God and know the sweet, fragrant power and peace of His Holy Spirit as you are led by this great saint--one who lived and walked in the presence of God and the power of the Spirit.

Tozer had a profound understanding of the enemy of our souls and the One who has vanquished him.  I have not been disappointed.  This collection of 12 sermons focus on the courage and fighting-fervor of the Christian.  Founded in Christ through faith, we are armed with great strength to engage in battle with that great adversary the Devil.  Pressing forward into maturity in Christ is the main theme of the book.  The chapter titles listed below will better illustrate the contents of the book than anything I could say.  Suffice to say that this is one of my favorite of Tozer's works (and is included in my Top 10 favorite books).<br />Chapter Titles:<br />1. I Talk Back to the Devil!<br />2.

Because of their importance, I have literally felt Satan attempting to thwart the purpose of God.  I have felt I was in raw contact with hell....

Much of the singing in certain types of meetings has in it more of romance than it has of the Holy Ghost.... Christ is courted with a familiarity that reveals a total ignorance of who He is.  It is not the reverent intimacy of the adoring saint but the impudent familiarity of the carnal lover.&quot; (from chapter 8)<br />&quot;God will allow His servant to succeed when he has learned that success does not make him dearer to God nor more valuable in the total scheme of things.&quot; (from chapter 13)<br />May God send us a true revival of spirit, heart and life!a true revival of spirit, heart and life!	2004-07-17

When Christians are harboring hard feelings against each other, they need to be reconciled.&quot; (from chapter 4)<br />&quot;Christian believers are called to be burning bushes.  They are not necessarily called to be great, or to be promoters and organizers.  But they are called to be people in whom the beautifying fire of God dwells, people who have met God in the purifying crisis of encounter!&quot; (from chapter 7)<br />&quot;Throughout church history, the great Christians were those who were willing to go down in humility before God.  Then they let God raise them up.  In our day very few of us are willing to go down.&quot; (from chapter 8)	2004-07-17

MacArthur moves beyond the objective assurance of doctrinal truth to the subjective assurance of the fruits of the believer.  He advocates a balanced approach to the doctrine that understands &quot;the perseverance of the saints&quot; as saints who actually persevere in faithfulness and godliness!  As James writes, &quot;Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him&quot; (1:12).<br />MacArthur's critics claim that teachings like those found in Saved Without a Doubt are contrary to scripture and serve only to undermine the pure doctrines of the reformation.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  MacArthur's understanding of this doctrine serves to deny security to tares and dead branches (Matt. 13:38, John 15:6) while giving full assurance to the one who has truly been chosen of God, come to genuine faith in Christ, and been sealed with the Holy Spirit.<br />May God raise up more men like John MacArthur who are willing to hold to the plain teaching of scripture even in the face of adversity and slander.	2004-07-15

Tozer was a man of great spiritual wisdom and discernment.  This book is an illustration of his great insight into the mystery of the Godhead.  Tozer leads the reader on a journey through the many and varied attributes of God.  Knowing the nature of our creator equips us to rightly judge truth from error and grace from law.  If we see God as He is--in all His glory and majesty--we will not so easily deviate from His blessed truth.  If we know that God is omnipotent, then what fear can we not face with faith?  If we know that God is immutable, then we can be sure that His promises will always stand firm.  If we know that God is gracious, then we will &quot;approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need&quot; (Hebrews 4:16).<br />While Tozer's discussion of God's attributes is brief, what he lacks in verbosity he more than makes up in substance, passion and understanding.  His words swell up from a heart that is overflowing with adoration for the Almighty, eternal, gracious, triune God.  Tozer so forcefully and zealously describes the attributes of God because he himself has stood in His presence.  When you read this book, you are not simply reading the words of one who has learned about God, but one whose &quot;face is radiant because he has spoken with the LORD&quot; (Exodus 34:29).	2004-07-10

The greater portion of the theological content of the book came from a single verse: &quot;The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name&quot; (Exodus 15:3).<br />The better part of the book is based upon the assumption that each man recieved some deep injury in adolescence from a male role-model (usually the father).  This &quot;wound&quot; injured the masculine (&quot;wild&quot;) spirit of us all and resulted in a life entirely focused on trying to gain the approval of the father (that is, to heal the &quot;wound&quot; by accomplishing what the wound made him feel could not be accomplished).  Having thus established this psychological foundation, John Eldredge attempts to draw God into the picture by proposing that God (as the perfect Father) is the one who can heal the father-wound once and for all.<br />This paternal psychology is all very lovely and noble, but it really has no place posing as theology.  I, for one, found no point of identification with the idea of the father-wound because my father was a supportive, loving, humble and godly man.  Many at the retreat felt this way also.  While this book may have its benefits for those with strained father-son relationships, I would not recommend it to anyone else.  For those seeking a closer relationship with God I would recommend The Pursuit of God by A.W. Tozer (quoted by Eldredge in this very book).	2004-07-10
US	37286784	R3MTL0MA8HMY9E	1556615140	557429648	Finney's Systematic Theology	Books	1	34	64	N	N	Beyond Arminianism, Beyond Heresy	I first read Finney because of references to him in the works of A.W. Tozer (one of my favorite authors).  Finney's life may have been Spirit-filled, but his understanding most certainly was not.  I object to the reviewer who compares him to Jonathan Edwards--Finney takes his lawyer's mind and twists the scripture to fit his understanding of justice.  His theology is indeed rational and logical--but it is in no way biblical.  He proves that &quot;the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing&quot; (1 Cor. 1:18).  Truly it was folly to Finney.<br />He plainly teaches against the graciousness of God and the saving power of the blood of Christ--arguing from a multiplicity of &quot;laws&quot; that Christ's sacrifice could not atone for our sins, but that we must pay the price for them ourselves by good works.  Out of this flow Finney's concept of the Holy Spirit as the agent by which we are enabled to live perfect and holy lives--through which we are justified before God and satisfy His divine justice.  No teaching has been more thoroughly refuted and despised as this: that man is saved by works, not of grace or through faith.<br />In fact, I wonder that Finney mentions Christ at all!  What need is there for a Savior if we are fully able to save ourselves?  Indeed, Finney believes that Christ died to set an example for us, so we would not take God's mercy for granted and &quot;continue in sin that grace may abound&quot; (Rom. 6:1).  Therefore the Son of God, the blessed Lord and Savior, has shed His precious blood for no greater reason than to show us what happens if we sin?!  Such heresy has rarely been uttered even by the lips of the most defiled sinner!  What is more distressing is that so many today actually BELIEVE this!<br />I do not despise Finney as a brother in Christ, nor do I deny that He was greatly used of God in his generation to awaken many to the need for godliness and faithfulness in these last days.  But I DO deny that he taught the truth concerning salvation--indeed, that he had any semblance of understanding at all.  This reaches far beyond the Arminian/Calvinist debate.  This theological system is founded upon the most destructive of all heresies--the denial of salvation by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and not of works (Eph. 2:8-9).

What need is there for a Savior if we are fully able to save ourselves?  Indeed, Finney believes that Christ died to set an example for us, so we would not take God's mercy for granted and &quot;continue in sin that grace may abound&quot; (Rom. 6:1).  Therefore the Son of God, the blessed Lord and Savior, has shed His precious blood for no greater reason than to show us what happens if we sin?!

Tozer speaks powerfully and movingly of the God who seeks after His creatures.  While \\"The Pursuit of God\\" focuses on man's hunger for God, \\"The Pursuit of Man\\" focuses on the doctrine of prevenient grace--or God's election and sovereign calling of man.  But don't read this book expecting some dry theological treatise--Tozer isn't satisfied with describing God's sovereign work of salvation in theological terms, he wants this truth to be living and active in the lives of all who are willing to recieve it.<br /><br />The first half of the book speaks passionately of God's desire for man to be saved and the action He takes as He pursues or \\"conquers over\\" sinful man.  The second half of the book deals with the sanctification of the one God has chosen, the power and promise of the indwelling Spirit, and the blessing of the Spirit-filled life.<br /><br />Tozer plainly and forcefully sets forth the truth declared in the scripture: that before man may seek God, God must first seek man.  His seamless movement from the election of God to the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit within those chosen of God is both refreshing and welcome in a day of rationalism and pragmatic theology.  Tozer always places God in His rightful place of glory and honor.  Calvinists will be uncomfortable with Tozer's synergistic approach to salvation and cessationists may feel uneasy in the later chapters of the book, but whatever theological persuasion you may be you cannot walk away from Tozer's writings without having caught a glimpse of the glory of the Almighty and the beauty of our Savior Jesus Christ.	2004-07-10

Unlike many of his fellow non-charismatics, David does not belabor the arguments for the cessationist view--choosing instead to focus on the attributes and workings of the Holy Spirit within every believer.  His writing is fully pastoral--neither encumbered with theological jargon or lacking in practical application.<br />While charismatics will feel that the book stops short of the full story and cessationists may feel uncomfortable in the deep waters of these great truths concerning the Holy Spirit, neither should write off this book.  Dr. Jeremiah plainly and lovingly sets forth the truth about the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit.  This is a truth which more Christians need to hear.  Cessationists today are generally afraid to speak of the Holy Spirit, much less to enjoy a life led and empowered by Him, and charismatics are often so focused on the miraculous outpourings of the Spirit that they neglect the simple, blessed truth that the Holy Spirit lives within each and every believer to sanctify, empower and guide him.<br />The only reason this book did not recieve 5 stars from me is its insistance upon a cessationist view of scripture.  While I understand the writer's need to establish the theological basis for a cessationist view of &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit,&quot; I feel that the book breaks from its primarily pastoral/practical focus in attempting to establish this view and distracts from the overall flow of this otherwise marvelous book.	2004-07-10

While certain other collections better focus on a particular subject, for sheer passion, power and insight this book is unsurpassed.  There was a time when I even considered it Tozer's best work (even ahead of The Pursuit of God)!

This book changed my life.<br />I grew up in a conservative Christian church, my father was a pastor, and I was studying for the ministry when I purchased this book as a gift for a good friend.  I didn't want to give him a gift that would lead him astray, so I decided to read the first chapter.<br />What I found was nothing like what I had known.  This was no dry, moldy, &quot;scholarly&quot; book--this was alive.  The blessed truths that had been buried in my heart and mind beneath the drudgery of modern scholarship's debates over dating, authorship and sources came pouring forth in what I can only describe as &quot;rivers of living water&quot; (John 7:38).  Through the Spirit-led power and insight of Tozer's writing I was awakened to the reality of the Almighty God and the nearness of His blessed Holy Spirit in an amazing way.  The prayer he offers at the end of the first chapter (in which he borrows Moses' prayer from Exodus 33) left me in stunned awe before my Maker.<br />This book (as its author was) is annointed with the presence and power God.  I would most highly recommend this book to any person--both those who thirst for more of God and those who know nothing of this deep soul-hunger.  Tozer speaks with an authority and passion characteristic of one who has been in the very presence of God.  Let the Spirit speak to you through this great saint as you embark upon Man's most noble effort--the Pursuit of God.	2004-07-06

Books	5	13	16	N	N	The Remedy to Modern Antinomianism	&quot;The Gospel According to Jesus&quot; is a modern-day theological masterpiece.  With piercing discernment, Spirit-led exegesis, and Christian love John MacArthur exposes the error of the &quot;cheap grace&quot; theology that plagues the church today.  His analysis of Christ's words is the much-needed cure for the common misinterpretations of Paul which have led to antinomian teaching.  This book is a response to those who &quot;distort [Paul's letters], as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction&quot; (1 Peter 3:16).  The passion and understanding of this book far outmatch any other modern theological work you will come across.  MacArthur adheres to the plain sense of the scripture and refuses to allow the words of Christ, apostle and prophet to be trampled underfoot by the anti-lordship teachers.  His gentleness and kindness in dealing with those he argues against is admirable (Paul, Luther or Calvin would have verbally torn them apart).  This book has been used by God to awaken many to the truth of Christ's undivided person--that He is both Savior and Lord.  I pray He will use it even more in the years to come.	2004-07-06

I was once a cessationist (one who believes that the Holy Spirit was only given in full measure at Pentecost, not to the church today).  My search for more of God led me to this man and eventually to this book.  I purchased the book after reading &quot;How to Be Filled With the Holy Spirit&quot; (a booklet also by Tozer) which left me thirsting for more of this great truth concerning the third person of the Trinity.<br />Tozer's understanding is fully Christ-centered (as Christ Himself says, speaking of the Holy Spirit: &quot;He will glorify me&quot; (John 16:14)).  Tozer cuts straight to the heart of the matter, discussing the Spirit's role in empowering, sanctifying and sustaining the child of God.  His understanding of the Holy Spirit flows naturally out of his intimacy with God and a plain reading of the scriptures.  His boldness is refreshing and his understanding is unmatched among all the authors I have read.<br />Since there is no &quot;look inside&quot; I thought it would be helpful and illustrative to list the chapter titles of the book, which summarize the contents.<br />Chapters:<br />1. Whenever Jesus Christ is Glorified, the Holy Spirit Comes<br />2. The Holy Spirit is Not Known through the Intellect<br />3. The Presence and Ministry of the Holy Spirit: All that Jesus Would Be<br />4. Pentecost: Perpetuation, Not Repetition<br />5. The Promised Filling of the Holy Spirit: Instantly, Not Gradually<br />6.

The Heavenly Dove: Repelled by Corruption<br />A Note to Thirsty Souls: I struggled a long time with what Tozer calls &quot;the dark, dark night of the soul.&quot;  Even though it seems that you may never break through into the bright light of God's presence, know that God is drawing you and will draw you to Him through faith in Christ Jesus.  It will be even more wonderful than you can imagine.  Wait upon the Lord and rest in Jesus.l draw you to Him through faith in Christ Jesus.  It will be even more wonderful than you can imagine.

Luther cuts down Erasmus' arguments for the freedom of Man's will in salvation with the two-edged sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  The power, sincerity, and passion of Luther's writing is matched only by the prophets, apostles and our Lord Himself.<br />No believer should be able to read this book and come away still believing in the total freedom of Man's will.  Luther wisely handles the most difficult objections in the same manner as the apostle Paul, answering naysayers with the challenge &quot;who are you to answer back to God?&quot; (Romans 9:20).<br />The only downfall of the book is that Erasmus' arguments are so weak.  Because of this, Luther spends much time refuting the foolish musings of reason and philosophy and therefore has less time to devote to the scripturally-based questions concerning this doctrine of the bondage of the will.  Luther proves truly that &quot;the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God&quot; (1 Cor. 1:18).	2004-06-29

This book successfully condenses the heavy exegesis of the larger work into an easily readable text.  Fee has a lot of poignant and challenging things to say concerning modern-day evangelicalism's understanding of the Holy Spirit.<br />The greatest danger of this condensation is the tendency some readers will have to accept Fee's conclusions without first examining his exegetical work.  I believe that Fee makes a number of exegetical mistakes--some minor, some major--which may lead the unlearned student astray.  While the work as a whole holds up against scrutiny, his explanation of Romans 7 is forced and inadequately supported (I believe this comes from his holiness background).  Likewise, he attempts to explain the fruit of the Spirit entirely in a community sense.  This also comes across forced and ignores the most natural meaning of the text.  (In this case, his focus on community seems to have overshadowed common sense in exegesis).<br />The book overall is a wonderful work and I would highly recommend it to anyone desiring to know more about the Holy Spirit.  Fee's emphasis on community is refreshing and his understanding of Paul far exceeds most scholars of this day.  May the Holy Spirit continue to work through this book for the glory of the Father and the revival of the church.	2004-06-29
