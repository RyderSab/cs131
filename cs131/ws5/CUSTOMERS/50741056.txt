No matter what maisy book, she loves it. This one is all about getting ready for bed, brushing teeth, using the potty and a  special little teddy bear. These books rule. We've even bought them in  italian versions because they are so appealing. The illustrations are  perfectly suited to toddlers, bright, simple and cheerful!(I Love Them  TOO! ) You can't go wrong with maisy!	2000-04-16

This book was bought when my two year old picked it out her self, the cover illustration is EVERY 2 yr old. She loves it, I cried outside the bookstore, this book is  INCREDIBLY moving. For every mom, new, old etc......A MUST. This book is  all about love of a child and how it never goes away. As for any  controversy/ 'oddity' in this book, it is sad how we can 'look' into such a  beautiful book and make it 'bad' (a child, beleive me, just will see the  plain obvious beauty of this book, children are so smart!). Please, for  everyone who's ever loved a child, buy it, it will be a book remembered,  passed down and cherished by all.	2000-03-27

We've been reading it since my little girl was one, and every time there is some thing new to focus our counting on. The concept is  GREAT, even if its to early to count, the beautiful illustrations hold  their own.	2000-03-27

I bought this when my daughter was 6 mos (she's now 2), we cant make it through this book! The story is a little long, definitely NOT simple (although it is beautiful, a mothers love is unconditional). The  illustrations are ok, not catchy enough for the younger set. The text is  definitely multicultural, ermine, mukluks, frankly its a little hard to  read. The overall feeling of this book is BEAUTIFUL, and I trully hope that  we'll enjoy it in the future. Just not now.	2000-03-27

My two yr old tires of them easily,  and she loves books. So, its says alot when she is sick of something, as well as myself. Don't get me wrong, if it  takes a favorite character as an incentive to read, buy this book. If you  want a book to enjoy for years to come, a book that will last in memory,  buy another book.	2000-03-13

My daughter loved this book sooo much that we need to buy a new one!  The book we had was in the Italian version, but the story is great and simple for the youngest  reader(1 day old! ).

I don't think this will ever be a classic, nor a story that has  any content. But it definitely has that 'Blue' appeal that infants and  toddlers love.	2000-03-13

Now I am a mother of a two yr old(who has time for &quot;mom&quot; books now! ) This book is Excellent! I was moved so much, that I still remember alot of the story!  I can see why this was made into a movie. READ the book first, it will give  the story so much more depth, than a movie could achieve solo. This aurthor  is one to look out for.	2000-03-11

I bought it when my daughter was 1, and she loves it, and I have learned also from it. I studied Italian recently in college, they sould show these videos!  They make learning  the language FUN, EASY, and IMBEDDED through repetition,  if only I had  this in college!  Granted, we have a native speaker, Italian, in our  house, Papa, but just through the videos my daughter has learned SOOOOO  much! By the way, the resident Italian gives these videos his seal of  approval!  I am thinking of bringing these to my mother inlaw, in Italy,  who is trying to learn english! They are so easy! If you want your child to  learn a second langauge, start now with this series!	2000-03-04
