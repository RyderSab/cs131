Kimball	Books	5	32	35	N	Y	The Work of a Prophet	This book exhaustively details the Presidency of Spencer W. Kimball who served as the 12th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until his death in 1985.  It is a follow-up to an earlier biography by Edward and Andrew Kimball-- respectively, Spencer's son and grandson.  The first volume was published shortly after Spencer Kimball became the President of the Church, a task accomplished by outliving all the other 15 Apostles (Quorum of 12 and First Presidency) who serve for life.  For that reason the first volume could not give extensive treatment to the Presidency of Spencer Kimball but serves an an indispensable prologue to \\"Lengthen Your Stride.\\"  (Full disclosure:  Edward Kimball was my Evidence Professor in Law School)<br /><br />Not only does this book reveal the daily life of a Prophet to an unprecedented degree, it chronicles and gives a context to one of the most significant events of LDS Church History.  The author holds nothing back--the sources are amazing.  Yet absolutely nothing contained in this work gives rise to questions about the wisdom of President Kimball's leadership or doubts regarding the divine direction of the Church.  Included with the book is a CD-ROM that contains the full working text prior to editing as well as the text of all of the out-of-print books published about President Kimball by the Church's own imprints.<br /><br />In trying to summarize why this book is so very interesting and such an essential volume, I keep coming back to the candor and honesty of its author.  Indeed, the publisher's note makes clear that the publisher and author had some disagreements regarding aspects of the work.  Although the Bible demonstrates that Prophets have their own struggles, there is a tendency for modern biographers to de-emphasize the difficulties faced by Presidents of the Church, to seemingly hesitate to discuss discouraging events.  Perhaps only President Kimball's son could write this book, but we can be glad that he did.  This second volume rounds out a biography worthy of the man--I cannot praise it highly enough.econd volume rounds out a biography worthy of the man--I cannot praise it highly enough.	2005-10-05

They have a spiritual significance that transcends the ordinary meetinghouses that you will find practically everywhere.  Yet, the Salt Lake Temple is not your ordinary LDS temple.  This is a building that took a staggering 40 years to build and now serves as a both the spiritual center and visual symbol for the entire church.  This book is not your ordinary book about temples--it is devoted solely to the Salt Lake Temple and provides an unmatched assemblage of historical information regarding this unique building.<br /><br />Brigham Young, the second president of the church, made as his first official act upon the entry of the Mormon pioneers into the Salt Lake Valley the marking of the site for the construction of this temple.  Bear in mind that the Salt Lake Valley was an unknown wilderness, yet despite the loss of prior cities and temples, Brigham Young and his people set to work immediately on a structure that is now recognized as an architectural treasure independently of its significance to the church.  This book describes not only the intimidating requirements of the construction but also the results of intricate craftsmanship and skills now all but lost.  It is almost impossible to conceive of a similiar investment of effort in the modern world, much less the final result of such a project.<br /><br />The Salt Lake Temple is literally a pile of hand-carved granite stones each weighing a couple of tons.  The stones were quarried from a mountain valley over 20 miles away and, until the railroad arrived many years later, each stone was brought to the site by oxcart.  Brigham publicly stated that he wanted the temple to stand forever; indeed, if there is a significant historical fact it is to be found in this work.<br /><br />This book is an excellent reference regarding the history and design of the temple--complete with pictures of English churches and buildings that influenced the temple's design.  The book contains a basic history of the construction, copies of design drawings, and pictures of the interior.  There is a great deal of explanatory commentary regarding the symbolism of the building, from the meaning of the six spires to the various phases of the moon stones that were laid down precisely according to astronomic observations.  Associated buildings found on temple square are also described.<br /><br />To this day any address in Salt Lake City makes direct reference to the location of the temple at the very center of the city.  The temple remains in active use and all indications are that the building will fulfill the goal of the prophet who directed its construction by standing forever.  Though better expositions exist regarding the purpose of temples, there is no better work available to the student of the history of this particular building--used copies are generally available and any efforts necessary to find a copy will be richly rewarded.ple's design.

Of course, we all know the relevance of the tulipmania, having lived through the internet boom--but it is particuarly fascinating to discover the parallels that teach, again, that history repeats itself.<br /><br />Is the lesson that market bubbles are the result of the destruction of barriers to entry?  Do bubbles result when those who previously could not afford to enter the established futures/equity markets are suddenly granted the ability to profit from speculation?  (One thinks immediately of the contemporary refinancing craze) Are there parallels to the Roaring Twenties, to the skyrocketing price of land at the present time?  Most certainly.  Are we too dumb to see it coming?  Probably.<br /><br />I found that Mr. Dash strikes an excellent balance between telling the story and providing ancillary history, between depth and breadth.  I'm no Doctor of Economics, but I felt that the work went into sufficient detail to allow parallels to be appropriately drawn from the event.  And, it was a fun read.  I'm going to plant tulips.	2005-09-18

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	3	4	7	N	Y	Nothing is Free	Mezrich's chronicle of the exploits of a gifted team of mathematicians is as compelling a morality tale as anything I have encountered recently.  It is a quick read--very interesting.  However, the book leads you to ponder the changes in the lives of the characters wrought by the easy money.  The supposedly \\"easy\\" money comes at a terrible cost.<br /><br />Forget the fact that the casinos do not hesitate to use any necessary means in order preserve their advantage; forget that casinos give an unlimited budget to the detectives and surveillance necessary to snare the player who beats the house--regardless of the legality of the player's methods; forget the wildly successful forays of the MIT teams; as the reader gets behind the excitement of the story and the pleasure of seeing a few students exact huge gains from the casinos any conclusion must bear in mind that the portrayed lifestyle does not enrich the lives of the characters--even as it enriches their bank accounts.  Though it was perhaps not the intent of Mr. Mezrich, a close reading of this book shows that the house still exacts its advantage.<br /><br />The moral lessons are universally applicable.  In order to pursue their scheme, the prodigiously gifted mathematicians are required to adopt a facade of utter hedonism.  However, it soon becomes clear that the lifestyle cannot be easily disengaged.  We perceive that there is no free lunch--a significant price is being paid.  I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I think that honesty is the best policy no matter whether the house deserves to be taken or not.  It seems apparent that the no-holds-barred pursuit of money is ultimately worthless if not dangerous.	2005-09-05

This volume was a staple of my elementary school training--obviously in the days prior to the endless competency testing that has shoved away the kinds of activities that made school fun.  Basically the book offers simple instructions for folding paper.  This isn't the extremely complex Japanese stuff, i.e. fold a working model of an internal combustion engine.  These are projects that a third-grader can accomplish.  I scoured the web for my copy but find that copies remain available even today at very reasonable prices.  Go get one.	2005-08-28

Background:  I was headed for a career as a computer programmer but got sidetracked into law school--so the coding process, complete with the obsessive focus on debugging, is not foreign to me.  The story is creepy because it seems so real and it hit this reader at least kind of close to home; sometimes we allow short-term goals to eclipse more important endeavors, for which we pay a price.<br /><br />\\"The Bug\\" is the story of a guy who just loses it.  This book's impact derives from the juxtaposition of the protagonist's search for what is later revealed to be a very simple error in computer code with what we come to see as an equally simple flaw in the protagonists own outlook on life.  By obsessively focusing on his own needs for accomplishment or satisfaction, Ms. Ullman chronicles her main character's descent into despair and allows us the omniscience to see what was happening.  It is a slow motion train wreck.  Good fiction allows us to experience vicariously that which we hope to never experience in reality.  Anyone who reads this book will feel better about their own life and will determine to do better.  Isn't that a good measure of a successful work of art?	2005-08-28

Of course, the dark side of anything seems to be that which draws us into the story--where's the conflict when everything is working well?  Mysteries require death and darkness.  How many characters have been sacrificed on the altar of fictionary expediency?  But dabbling is often rewarded; I am glad that I found The Club Dumas and was pleased to find a uniquely interesting take on bibliomania easily analogized to any of the many interests that can imprison the willing.<br /><br />This work is a great piece of misdirection.  Frankly any commentary on the story risks betraying the device used with such skill by Mr. Perez-Reverte and which I believe sets this book apart as a great read.  And given the reverence of the characters for the works of Dumas, I suspect that I'll have to go start reading The Three Musketeers and Count of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />There is a great truth taught in this work.  Unsavory characters have unsatisfactory lives.  Further, why do we tend to embrace that which has no power to enrich?  Take the character of Fargas, the last member of a great family who has retreated into himself.  Fargas lives in his decaying family mansion, which is literally falling apart all around him, spending his time with his only friends--his books.  Not just books, but fantastically rare and valuable works.  Every year or so Fargas selects one of the treasures every now and again to \\"sacrifice\\" for the good of the others.  Yet despite the surpassing wealth represented by the pile of rare editions, Fargas can't seem to part with the books and restore his family's fortune.  Our protagonist, Corso, likewise has so retreated into himself that he questions the value of everything about him--yet he encounters a group that seems to find joy and meaning in the very books that Corso sees only as money.<br /><br />Regrettably, our author has doubts about the power of his language to portray the interpersonal relationships--if only he, as could Dumas, could have avoided the explicit descriptions of that which needs no description, the work would have easily secured a fifth star.ower of his language to portray the interpersonal relationships--if only he, as could Dumas, could have avoided the explicit descriptions of that which needs no description, the work would have easily secured a fifth star.	2005-08-21

Rarely, if ever, have I encountered a better and more intriguing proof of that concept.  Mr. Haddon's protagonist is autistic to a degree that at once allows him the privilege of being a disinterested observer of our world while at the same time being functional to a degree that raises the question in the reader's mind as to whether life is actually more fulfilling with or without the emotions, attachments and social rules in which the rest of us are immersed.  It is a very quick read.  The plot moves briskly and the characters are wonderfully developed.<br /><br />The author neatly interweaves his various themes into a quest novel--a quest no less epic in its unique fashion than any of the great works.  The work is profoundly moving.  The journey Mr. Haddon portrays is shared by all if not experienced in the same fashion.  It is outstanding fiction and is my first recommendation to anyone looking for a good read.	2005-08-15

It appears as though I am not alone.<br /><br />However, Dr. Rockmore is staking out a different turf than the other books.  His goal seems not to be geared towards explaining the difficult topics so much as giving a lay reader an introduction to the various issues that pertain to the problem of the Riemann Hypothesis.  Metaphor and simile are not the best tools for describing higher mathematics.  My only criticism of this book is that while it touches on everything it actually explains very little.  At first, having read the Sabbagh and Derbyshire books, this was frustrating; however, it becomes clear that the purpose of this book is very different.<br /><br />\\"Stalking the Riemann Hypothesis\\" is more in the nature of \\"Einstein's Dreams\\" by Alan Lightman.  It is more an attempt to convey the mathematician's wonder and curiosity than an understanding of the underlying science; seen in this light, I felt the book succeeded.	2005-08-12

Don't get lost in the comedy--though it is hilariously funny, it is a gallows humor.  As ridiculous as the plot or characters may seem, the book is never far from the truth.  Our society passed into the absurd some time ago and Mr. Helprin is merely holding up a mirror.<br /><br />In my opinion there are a good deal of readers who just don't get this book.  It would be most instructive for them to review Mr. Helprin's \\"Swan Lake\\" series and to see Mr. Helprin's contempt for the ersatz \\"leaders\\" most now choose to follow.  If we learn anything from this book, and most will choose to disregard its very simple teachings, it is that anything just and true has a cost.  Those who pay the cost are entitled to an understanding that brings the peace and contentment that money or fame falsely promises.  Frankly, there is not one of Mr. Helprin's works that doesn't clearly address a theme of rising above the ordinary--a quest for perfection.<br /><br />An author this gifted writes at many levels--I cannot hope to have plumbed the depth of this work on one reading but like his other novels expect the book to reward additional study.  Helprin reminds us that we each have an unlimited destiny and power to do good in the world if we will choose the correct path.  Indeed, that there is one correct path to success, which is admirably summarized by Freddy in a particularly memorable speech, is Helprin's message.  There are no shortcuts.  There is absolute truth.<br /><br />We can become kings and queens--it is our inheritance.  Disagree if you will with the message or its presentation but I have encountered no other modern author possessed of the sheer force of language to do justice to the argument.	2005-08-09

Books	4	3	3	N	N	Great Reworking of an Old Story	Mothership is at its heart a buddy tale; two guys off on a grand adventure who discover more than they bargained for.  Of course, they are joined by an enigmatic woman who knows most of what is really going on. The story is exceptionally good science fiction with an accomplished mix of backstory and character development.  Great summer reading--I haven't seen the likes of this kind of work since Heinlein and it is tragic to encounter an author this good only to find that there will be no more works.<br /><br />It is a story of discovery on many levels not the least of which is self-discovery.  Mr. Brosnan clearly owed a debt to whoever came up with the 1973-1974 TV series \\"Starlost\\" in which characters from a rustic non-technological society learn that they are in reality passengers on a giant starship that is missing a crew.  Starlost tanked.  Mothership succeeds because the author has spent some time thinking about the backstory--too often science fiction has great characters with a lousy ill-conceived plot or great plot and lousy characters.  Brosnan gets the balance just right.  As opposed to the now typical practice of abruptly ending a book in order to entice readers to sequels, Brosnan wraps up at least part of his narrative in the first book.  However, this reviewer hopes that a sequel was completed before his untimely demise.	2005-07-28

They are machines capable of self-replication and self-<br /><br />repair that exist for no other purpose than to eliminate life, which of course has predictable consequences when said machines encounter humanity.  The Berserker represents several common themes of science fiction--the potential danger of artificial intelligence, the wisdom of unleashing the ultimate weapon, the unknown dangers of space, parallells between artificial and natural intelligences, etc.  Unfortunately, none of these ideas are explored in this book.  The original stories were great, but Berserker Prime doesn't come close to delivering on its promise.	2005-06-15

I for one, resent the author's sometimes snide implication that the market isn't capable of providing healthy food or that people aren't capable of making more educated eating choices.  However, for any lover of fine burgage, this is a captivating summary of the history and scope of the fast-food market that is both well-researched and an interesting read.<br /><br />This book gets four stars based solely upon the author's recognition of the ultra-quality In-n-Out burger--the product of a chain born in Southern California that is fanatically dedicated to providing the freshest and highest-quality fast food according to a recipe and menu that has been unchanged for over 40 years.  (Name any other restaurant that can guarantee that the meat was never frozen and where the french fries start their day in potato form and I'll be there buying lunch.)  The author's recognition that the entire market is or should be chasing In-n-Out, i.e. focusing on the quality of the food, truly shows that this guy knows his stuff.<br /><br />If consumers accept crappy merchandise, that is what the market will provide; rather, consumers should demand quality, especially when their food is concerned.  Perhaps the message of this book lies more in the fact that so many of us fail to exercise our freedom to discriminate between good and bad even when all it takes is walking across the street to a better restaurant.	2005-05-24

From start to finish the book evidences Mr. Connelly's respect for pure police work untainted by political and personal considerations.  Chief Bratton has clearly made a positive impact on our author.  As a character, Harry Bosch had been kind of drifting--I am glad to welcome him back.<br /><br />This book is the finest example of a police procedural.  It touches on all the major policing issues of the day, local use of the Patriot Act, the \\"CSI\\" effect, various social issues, attention to unsolved cases, increased expectations of officers, and still remains faithful to the predecessor works. Granted, you have to know the prior works to fully appreciate the involvement of Deputy Chief Irving and Bosch's newfound peace with his situation but Connelly's plot is rich enough to carry the entire work without the need for Bosch's usual internal conflicts.  Besides, I'm sure that Bosch will run into trouble again soon--L.A. has a new mayor and nobody knows what he really believes or what he really stands for (other than re-election.<br /><br />The masters make their work appear effortless--this work takes Connelly and Bosch to new heights.

What brought forth Bach's \\"Offering\\" of such unimaginable complexity?  An annoyed genius--you just have to love that.  For years I have read biography after biography (with one sterling exception--see my early reviews) that portray Bach as a kind of small town savant who was later and fortunately \\"discovered.\\"  Oh, so far from the truth...<br /><br />Mr. Gaines reminds us that Bach was at the very center of his world--that Bach embodied the ideals of the Baroque.  For this reason the juxtaposition of Bach and Frederick the Great is an excellent vehicle for demonstrating the ideas that were the power behind Bach's transcendent music.  The reader is shown that Bach was no less a King in his own fashion than was Frederick--instead of armies to project power, Bach had an absolute mastery of musical art that despite the passage of 250 years still speaks to billions of people.  What this book convincingly argues is that Bach was quite aware of his power and the supremacy of his beliefs and that he used the Offering to send a message.<br /><br />In visiting Frederick's palace, Bach not only accepted the challenge he knew was coming but he so conquered the rigged game that the other side figuratively left and went home.  I had no idea how messed up King Frederick really was, even if he could play a passable flute--this is the kind of \\"x-files\\" history that puts the great ideas of history in context and is fun to read.<br /><br />In reviewing the aged Bach's life, Mr. Gaines leads one to consider the loneliness of a man who knew that he could speak a language of eternal beauty that few people had the patience to hear.  We all know that Bach had a temper and demanded excellence from students and justice from his employers; however, in reading this book we are introduced to the mature Bach so confident in his power that he delivered a clear rebuke to a King.<br /><br />Mr. Gaines makes a compelling argument that perhaps our culture could stand to return to those absolute truths that so moved Bach.  That constraint and limitations can bring forth sublime creations denied to those who throw off the perceived shackles of convention.  Highly recommended and a must-read for any disciple of Bach.ines makes a compelling argument that perhaps our culture could stand to return to those absolute truths that so moved Bach.

The translation from the German is excellent and the ideas presented are profound.  Mr. Eschbach is obviously a student of Orson Scott Card and the book is rife with references to such Card stories as Unaccompanied Sonata, Kingsmeat, Fat Farm and others.  In fact, the feeling of reading this work took me back to my discovery of Card in the pages of OMNI magazine.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that the story revolves around the \\"hair carpet\\" a breathtakingly intricate work built up of individually knotted strands of human hair.  Only men can be a carpet maker and they, of necessity, spend their entire life on one carpet.  Ultimately, the work consumes the life of the maker only to finance the next generation's toil.  As only one son can inherit, the household must consist of several wives and a house full of daughters to produce a requisite variety of hair colors.  Extra sons aren't given a job out in the fields...<br /><br />The work is less a novel and more of an expanded short story; the author paints a broad picture by the use of inter-related episodes that roughly tie together.  The underlying theme and story provide a framework strong enough to carry the work without the need for one fully-developed character.  In fact, spending more time on characterization would have detracted from the impact of this work.<br /><br />I honestly could not put the book down until it was over.  The ending is that killer-twist so reminiscent of early Card stories. The themes are profoundly German; there is a distrust of power in all its varieties, whether derived from religion, government, family or social expectations.  Regardless of how you approach the work be prepared to think about the ideas presented for days.<br /><br />Mr. Eschbach is on my must purchase list.  TOR would do well to start translating his work as fast as possible.	2005-04-30

Indeed, it is heartening to find an author who still understands that there are absolute rights and absolute wrongs.<br /><br />The opening scene of the book is instructive: Mma Ramotswe is observing the world around her when she sees a shoplifter and leaps from her table to apprend the miscreant only to be stopped and accused of trying to defraud the restaurant at which she was enjoying a tea.  Is she really just as guilty as the shoplifter?  Of course not, she means no harm--but, then again, the reader has the unique benefit of knowing her true intent.<br /><br />The story then moves through the resolution of several similar situations.  The author shows how justice can miscarry if people are unwilling to examine the tougher issues of \\"intent\\" by separating a person's actions from the motivation for such actions.  Deep stuff.<br /><br />The success of this series is that its deceptively simple situations mask some serious philosophy.  And the author continues to circle back on the same lessons in different manners.  I had to laugh when Mma Makutsi teaches a lesson in morality to a beautiful girl (the title of a previous work in the series).  In response to a sarcastic and biting comment, Mma Makutsi gives a humble and difficult reply, truly an example of \\"turning the other cheek\\".  In savoring her comeback, the reader perceives that the author set the story up such that Mma Makutsi's comment speaks to several different issues all at once.  Surprisingly, this book is as close to a written fugue as any new fiction I've encountered of late.<br /><br />By taking the complexity out of the surroundings and focusing upon the inherent complexity of human relationships, Mr. Smith again provides a satisfying tale that is neither simplistic nor morally ambiguous.  Plain and simple.

On its face a simple private-eye story, the central conceit of the novel is the idea that future science will bestow a type of immortality upon the world by merely downloading the \\"soul\\"--presumably the electrical impulses racing around the brain--into a \\"cortical stack.\\"  Indeed, thanks to \\"needlecasting\\" you can be beamed across the known universe into a waiting body without the need for physical voyages; a fine riff on the Star Trek Transporter idea.  Now this idea has been done before, but without Mr. Morgan's careful exploration of the philosophical implications.<br /><br />What is it like to wake up in a different body?  What is it like to be a part of society where others can afford to live in their own bodies in perpetuity as opposed to those who must suffer the indignity of being \\"stacked\\"?  What if a loved one is \\"resleeved\\" in a different body--how does that affect your feelings?  Worse, what if your beloved's body is inhabited by someone else?  How effective is \\"prison\\" when the criminal simply sleeps off the time?  All of these questions are treated and more.  I quite enjoyed the idea of A.I.'s co-existing in society with the humans and having to compete for resources; all they want is to be useful.<br /><br />The story revolves around that idea.  Happiness, true worth and value are not the results of having money, resources, and long-life...  Such are the rewards of being useful and doing good.<br /><br />Now, in a postscript:  The obscenity and sexual content were unnecessary.  Characters can be dark enough without filling their mouths with language that makes me wonder if I should keep the book on the shelf.  As for the graphic sexual content--it was completely ancillary to the story--disturbingly so.  As to the various perversions, let us stipulate that terrible things happen in unsavory and dark locations--don't force the reader to wade through the muck.  As to the graphic depictions of adultery, why not use artful language to convey the emotional impact?  Why must the act be experienced directly by the reader?  The language makes reading this novel like stepping in a dog turd while walking through a fascinating city--the sex like accidentally running into an amorous couple in the park.  Do you stare?  or do you silently wish that they had gotten a room?  One wishes Mr. Morgan all the best but hopes he will stick to developing ideas instead of chasing baser instincts.depictions of adultery, why not use artful language to convey the emotional impact?

I'm in awe of Mr. Wright's ability to toss off a summarization of just about every mythology I've ever heard of and probably a few new ones that he snuck in for laughs.  This guy could make a plumbing manual interesting.  This book is, of course, a sequel.  The first Everness book was amazing--the characters just kept coming and they were good ones as well.  Be warned, a careful reading of the first novel is necessary to understanding what in the heck is going on.  Nevertheless, Wright has a gift for action--his plot never drags.<br /><br />The Everness books are a fine reminder that we speak a language of story, that our modern entertainments are built upon their predecessors.  Who would have imagined Batman as Merlin's heir?  How about a Clancyesque American coup d'etat plot based upon seal-men wearing coats of Congressional skin?  What would Prometheus do if he were stuck on an aircraft carrier for a couple hours?  How about designing an ultra superduper nuke?  Inspired.<br /><br />Mr. Wright joins my automatic purchase list.  Nothing this man has written has disappointed in the slightest.  The Everness books will become a staple of the genre.	2005-03-31

Frankly, I don't know if the subject exists that Stephenson couldn't make compelling.  Jack Shaftoe and Eliza (and many others, Waterhouse and Dappa included) prove that despite any societal limitations a keen mind and native intelligence can equal or better the blessings of royal birth--and they provide the momentum for a fascinating ride that can be enjoyed on many levels.<br /><br />However, Stephenson was about much more than fiction--the System of the World is just that--the story of our World.  Three hundred years from now I can imagine that someone is going to have very similar things to say about our society as Stephenson does in this trilogy.  The work is about the value of understanding humanity--its gifts and its potential to make a better world.<br /><br />Newcomen's engine, being the fruit of Dr. Waterhouse's enlightened technologickal research and development program itself indebted to Eliza's expertise with international capital finance, is to the industrial revolution shortly to follow as our modern-day ENIAC is to the information revolution in which we are at present swept up.  We owe so much to the ideas born in the Baroque era--we still listen to the music of Bach and in my opinion have yet to produce its equal--that we forget that we are serving as the foundation for a future that is as far from our appreciation as the Concorde was from Van Hoek's Minerva (a sailing vessel).<br /><br />The work makes countless wry commentaries on our present culture.  Dr. Waterhouse's distaste of the libelous press seemed awfully close to a rant on modern tabloids.  The discussions of the more enlightened royals were not dissimilar to many of the policy debates still facing society.  Should we figuratively pave over the Fleet?  or should we do something about it at the source?  Can we duplicate the fertile ground that was Baroque-era England and duplicate the tremendous progress of the industrial revolution with its the ensuing societal and scientific advancements?<br /><br />And I promise any reader, the surprises at the end are well worth the entire 2,700 page read.  In fact, I don't think I'm reading too much into it, but Newton's struggles for immortality seem awfully close to our modern debates over stem cells and exotic medical treatments.  Cryptonomicon was about gold.  The Baroque Cycle is about the Solomonic gold--wisdom.  Can we, like Waterhouse, honor the gift of Solomonic gold and know precisely how and when to use it?nsuing societal and scientific advancements? <br /> <br />And I promise any reader, the surprises at the end are well worth the entire 2,700 page read.

It is an updated retelling of the bestselling memoirs of Captain James Riley of the Commerce who with his crew encounter and overcome unrivalled bad fortune.<br /><br />Mr. King's book is enhanced by his careful presentation of the historical context of the story.  Captain Riley and crew knew very little of the dangers of the Sahara Desert but, as shown, they soon learned that all the terrible stories about Saharan shipwrecks were true.<br /><br />If you liked the story of Shackleton and the Endurance--you will appreciate Mr. King's description of how Captain Riley and several of his crew overcome dehydration, slave traders, cultural ignorance, and with the help of some smart decisions and fortunate encounters manage to return home.  As with all good adventure literature the story reinforces the importance of maintaining a positive attitude and conveys the crucial lesson that there is always hope no matter how bad the situation.<br /><br />The author also reminds us of the value of personal honor and integrity; attitudes and obligations that were taken for granted among the British and Americans in Captain Riley's day that have now been lost--are we the better for it?  Or, does our culture now more closely resemble that of the brutal slave-trading Saharans?	2005-03-05

It passes the \\"can't put down\\" test--no other test is as important.  I carried this book through several airports and was never bored.  On that ground alone it gets a high recommendation.  It is a story about the war on terrorism focusing closely upon the combatants and to this reviewer reflected a level of research and detail not up to Clancy's standard but not far short.<br /><br />Contrary to the other expressed opinion, I found the plot realistic enough.  In fact, one of the lessons of 9/11 is that any author would be hardpressed to come up with a scenario that is \\"unrealistic\\".  The politics were subtle enough for me and did not detract from the story in the manner of other works in this genre.  After all, the readership is fairly well educated in the nuances of the situation.  In fact, I think this is one reason why there are so few successful geo-political thrillers these days.<br /><br />I appreciated the way that the characters' responses to various situations explained their motivations rather than the more typical device of an omniscient narration.  This book was not short of characters but they were all well drawn.  I'm looking forward to reading more of Mr. Seymour's works.	2005-03-03

I was fascinated from start to finish by his interweaving of modern science and time-honored insights.  He highlights the fact that the advance of science cannot bring comfort by itself but must be used with wisdom and an understanding of the purpose of life.<br /><br />The book is an argument that mankind's time on earth is naturally limited and that the efforts of science to extend life sometimes miss the point.  Dr. Nuland does not even spare himself in criticizing some of the excesses of modern medicine.  Quite simply, he argues that there is a fate worse than death itself--that often the additional time purchased by science comes at a fearful cost.<br /><br />However, Dr. Nuland is no Luddite--he does acknowledge the improvements that medical science has provided.  But in discussing death by way of various case histories and personal experiences, Dr. Nuland hopes that we come to appreciate that death has a purpose and importance that when understood will lessen our fear and increase our appreciation for the gift of life.  We are all alike subject to death and whether by a random accident, untimely disease or simply old age, the results are the same and must be confronted by all.	2005-02-25

Seriously, this author has a gift for making the horrendously complex not only understandable but he also manages to convey the excitement of the scientific discoveries he describes.<br /><br />Piece by piece, Dr. Singh demonstrates how brilliant insights pile up until they have weight sufficient to overcome popular bias.  The book is an excellent defense of the scientific method and was as interesting as any finely crafted mystery.  Neither too complex nor too simple, this is clearly a work for the layperson but it is writing of the first-rate.  I could not put it down until I finished.	2005-02-11

I enjoyed this book and found it to be a welcome return to Mr. Grisham's tried and true portrayal of a lawyer in trouble who manages to frustrate the bad guys and save his own skin.  Some may quibble with the attempt to tread upon Tom Clancy's hallowed ground but in today's post-Clinton world you just can't blame Mr. Grisham for going after the Vernon Jordan set.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham writes escape stories and he writes them well.  His most successful stories place a flawed but sympathetic character who is at the mercy of the ethically challenged (i.e. bad guys) into a situation initially of their own making from which they safely extricate themselves by making decisions as smart as their previous decisions were stupid.  Therein lies the trick--Grisham balances the dilemmas perfectly.  The character bears a measured amount of blame for his circumstances; not so much that he is unsympathetic, but enough so that there is room for the character to remake themselves--thereby encouraging the reader to cheer the character's efforts.<br /><br />In addition to Mr. Grisham's skill with characters and plot, I enjoyed the Italian setting.  This is not a book to read if you are hungry--the descriptions of food cannot be endured on an empty stomach.  This is, however, a perfect book for those times when you don't need a challenging read, just great entertainment.	2005-02-02

I love this series because the characters are real and the dilemmas profoundly reflective of the world in which we live. Renko just deals with the rotten hands he is played and does so with selflessness, honor and integrity. Despite being surrounded by vice and corruption--Renko remains true to himself.  All of the books in the series deal with the triumph of the human spirit over the most appalling of circumstances but Smith's setting of \\"Wolves Eat Dogs\\" primarily at the location of the Chernobyl nuclear accident is inspired. The residents of the radioactive \\"zone\\" are, as is Renko, themselves dealing the best they can with the same toxic and tragic results of poor Soviet decision-making. Moral decay is juxtaposed with the omnipresent radioactive decay and shown to be no less dangerous.  Without betraying the story, let's just say that some of characters deal with their circumstances better than others.<br /><br />\\"Wolves Eat Dogs\\" is the rare work that is confident in portraying the truth that happiness is truly independent of what the world may claim to be success; that all obstacles can be overcome and that integrity is indeed its own reward.  Such frank treatment of moral issues is, in my opinion, a hallmark of worthy literature.<br /><br />The fact that this is a story that is resolved without being solved is by itself enough to make this a five-star mystery. Without spoiling the read, let me just say that few authors are able to so skillfully and satisfactorily misdirect the reader as Mr. Smith. Highly recommended--definitely a book that you can't put down until you are finished.	2005-01-29

I have yet to read a Crichton novel better than The Andromeda Strain--the scientific extrapolation was brilliant, the plot was tense and had plenty of nice twists, and characters were real.  State of Fear was a quick read, but like many of Mr. Crichton's recent novels, it reads like a screenplay.  It is all action with little or no character development and any questions raised by the novel are answered with dispatch and without delay--the reader simply doesn't have to think.  State of Fear will, no doubt, be a blockbuster movie but could have been a much better novel.<br /><br />The book was kind of like Janis, Mr. Evans' uncomplicated love-interest--always ready with action, never ready to tax the reader.  Any plot twist was resolved with the efficiency of Dr. Kenner's environmental arguments.  But what in the heck is a certain character doing wandering the jungle alone despite roving bands of cannibals?  Seriously?  That is as poor a plot device as was found in Crichton's novel \\"Congo\\" when an African coup d'etat takes place right when the protagonist's plane lands followed later by a precisely timed volcanic eruption.  So in \\"State of Fear\\", how is it that an identified tsunami threat to Southern California did not result in the immediate dispatch of a strike force?  Why does the author rely on one character to dispense the totality of the environmental wisdom and in such detail?  The predictability of both the characters and the plot needs to be toned down and the characters fleshed out for the ideas to truly shine; Crichton is capable of this.<br /><br />The action is just a little far out in this one.  I had a much easier time believing in Jurassic Park's dinosaurs.  I expect the \\"world will end\\" plot in a Dirk Pitt novel--no matter how capable the foes, Mr. Pitt rides to the rescue and saves the day.  But Mr. Crichton is capable of so much more.  The Kenner character was too much: the scientific genius who seems to also have been a graduate of SEAL training.  The ELF bad-guys were too powerful--too \\"Dr. Evil\\" for a believable work.<br /><br />Instead of globe-trotting at the last second to multiple potential disasters, a Clancyesque attention to reality would have served well.  One real disaster, developed with attention and detail would have sufficed and would have let the characters do more than jump on the handy jet.<br /><br />While it was a fun and worthwhile read that reflected some serious research, it could have been much, much more.the scientific genius who seems to also have been a graduate of SEAL training.

Face it, though number theory can be beguiling--my introduction was the fine biography of Erdos by Paul Hoffman--many of the recent popular works on mathematics are difficult and too often leave the reader disappointed.  To this reviewer, Prime Obsession is every bit as fun to read as the latest pulp fiction but after the story is over, this work leaves the reader with a gift of understanding.<br /><br />What made Prime Obsession so fun to read was the excellent balance between exposition of the story and exposition of the underlying ideas.  This book was not afraid to go deeper into the mathematics than similar works, such as The Music of the Primes by du Sautoy.  Derbyshire alternated between chapters of narrative with chapters purely about the underlying mathematics.  Not only did the author produce a compelling story but the science was surpassingly well taught--the understanding of the zeta function engendered in the reader adds punch to the story.  It is always nice to have at least a little knowledge of what is going on.<br /><br />Although the typical non-mathematician who chooses to read this book will already appreciate the intellectual achievements of Berhard Riemann, it is the gift of Derbyshire's work that with a reasonable investment of thought any reader can begin to glimpse the beauty and elegance of higher mathematics.<br /><br />This book was so good that as soon as I finished I ran out and bought \\"Seeing Calvin Coolidge in a Dream\\"; frankly, that says it all.  This is a must read.	2005-01-18

I recently revisited the book and was surprised to find a story that had survived the years quite well.  As in much of 70s science fiction, this work focuses on social issues under a veneer of space opera.<br /><br />The protagonist is a member of a subjugated race that bears patiently the burdens of prejudice and intolerance.  Fortunately he finds an enlightened soul who looks past common prejudice and gives our hero the chance to break free.  Predictably we learn that this oppressed race has an intellect to match their brute strength.  Unfortunately the author forgets to pay as much attention to the plot as to the message.<br /><br />Despite the overt and preachy tone of the story the science fiction is actually pretty good.  Nothing that is going to challenge the likes of Dune--but enough to warrant seeking out others of Mr. Morressy's works.	2005-01-15

Make no mistake, this work is well over one thousand pages--considering the myriad tiny footnotes that add so much to the depth of the narrative.  It was an enjoyable read from start to finish; that is certainly the highest compliment that I can give.<br /><br />The book defies categorization.  It is neither a history nor a fantasy, not a mystery nor any of the myriad categories that books are thrown into these days.  The elegance of the book is apparent from its perfectly accurate title.  This is indeed, a novel.  A long narrative with a plot unfolded by the thoughts and actions of its characters.  I found the characters to be fascinating--Norell with his endless collection of books, Strange with his innate confidence in his own abilities and Childermass somewhere in the middle.  It is the story of two approaches to the restoration of a body of knowledge--Norell relies on books and is hesitant to try new things while Strange is anxious to use his own nascent talents without regard for written warnings.  The twist is, of course, that the seemingly more cautious Norell is indeed the more reckless of the characters.<br /><br />More could be said about the story but to know too much about the book before reading it would detract from the pleasure of discovery that this book provides.  It is so very, very rare to encounter so original a work.  Highly recommended.	2005-01-14

Cheesy movies had zombies staggering out of radioactive clouds--better movies had nutcases dropping atomic bombs.  Oryx and Crake is merely an updated version of the scare story drawing its premise from the development of the biological sciences rather than atomic weaponry.  It is very well written and a fast read, but is so clearly an attempt to ride the hysteria that accompanies scientific progress that this reviewer was disappointed.<br /><br />Although the author skillfully hooks the reader and moves the plot along nicely, it is difficult to suspend disbelief.  In an era of shrinking employee benefits and increased governmental oversight of something as innocuous as stem cells it is ludicrous to imagine the wholesale creation of dangerous animal hybrids let alone tampered humans; never mind the all-encompassing complexes of pharmaceutical corporations.<br /><br />If you like to slow down in order to see what is happening at accident scenes, this is the book for you.	2005-01-07

Far from attempting to summarize the \\"great ideas\\", the author skillfully advances a thesis by citations ranging from Aristotle to cartoons from the \\"New Yorker\\".  I found this book to be a very tight and persuasive argument and a model of clarity.  Everything about this work, from the selection of illustrations to the orderly development and resolution of the thesis question, evidences a polished elegance that only the uninformed pass over without appreciation.<br /><br />The author delivers on his promise to demonstrate that status anxiety has an exceptional ability to cause sorrow.  He opines that status anxiety is a uniquely human condition and argues that we can avoid a great deal of pain by seeking to understand this basic human need to belong.  De Botton's genius--what makes his books both enjoyable and thought-provoking--is his ability to advance his thesis in a manner that is at once familiar and profound.  We are, for example, invited to ponder on the issue of whether a room full of salesmen from 1902 can be considered successful, whether their achievements are worthy of emulation, of how well our own hopes and desires will weather time; we are invited to examine a work of art and consider how a painting of a weathered building can move us to consider the unseen and often unappreciated complexity and depth of the world in which we live--the questions posed are not amenable to simple resolution.  It is a pleasure to encounter a work that makes demands on its reader in which the reader does not fail to recover the investment.<br /><br />De Botton does not shun the controversial nor is he afraid to make big statements.  In the fashion of his book \\"The Art of Travel\\", \\"Status Anxiety\\" invites us to slow down and take a good hard look at where our efforts are taking us--whether we have chosen to pursue goals in philosophy, art, politics, religion or merely to do the opposite of what we believe society regards as \\"correct\\".  The book teaches that our choices--both large and small--are significant and they have far-reaching consequences that we would do well to consider.<br /><br />This book was an absolute pleasure to read; I give it my highest recommendation.igion or merely to do the opposite of what we believe society regards as \\"correct\\".

Hinckley is sustained as THE prophet by over 12 million members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  The final say in how the Church is directed rests entirely with President Hinckley and this book is a fascinating exposition of how the Lord continues to unfold the earthly organization that He will use to accomplish the goals outlined in scripture.<br /><br />In the story as presented by Elder Carmack, we can see that while the idea behind the PEF was around since Brigham Young and while the need for educational assistance to the poor was recognized and the subject of existing programs, that the proper and inspired implementation of this far-reaching program combined several factors:  (1) Strong local priesthood leadership, (2) Financial strength and willingness to contribute on the part of the general membership, (3) Particular expertise in multi-national financing and administration, (4) Existing resources at the General Administration level, and most importantly, (5) A Prophet inspired by God to present the program, motivate the people and put the whole mix together at the right time and in the right way.<br /><br />Elder Carmack shows how the Lord had prepared individuals (including the membership of the Church itself) in miraculous ways to fulfill a role in bringing this program online.  In so doing, he shows how the Church is administered at the highest levels.  It is comforting to know that President Hinckley has the resources to accomplish such tremendously significant tasks and compelling to ponder on the incredible benefits that this profound program will have on the lives of individuals and influence of the Lord's Church.<br /><br />(The book should be required reading for Priesthood leadership if only to teach how effectively the First Presidency conducts its private meetings.)	2005-01-04

I immediately purchase any new book by Mr. Baxter, he has been a favorite author of mine since Raft.  I know of no other science fiction author so fascinated with the questions of why the universe exists and where it is going.  You also will not find too many authors willing to kill off the entire earth as a plot device; when something goes horribly wrong in a Baxter novel, the entire universe past, present and future is at play.<br /><br />That said, I was just a little disappointed in Exultant.  The theme of a stagnant civilization delivered from entropy by the heroic actions of the protagonist has been visited too many times in this genre.  As with all of Mr. Baxter's works there is no shortage of thought-provoking ideas, but this work failed to integrate the ideas.  The exposition of the true nature of the black hole at the center of the galaxy just didn't work--by the time our hero makes his fateful choice this reader didn't have enough invested in the whole question to really make a value judgment, which seemed to be the whole purpose of the work.<br /><br />The galactic civilization stuff has been done before.  Coalescent was brilliant: made you really think about issues of human evolution and possibility.  Exultant would get a much higher review had I not been familiar with Mr. Baxter's other works.

Who doesn't feel like a Sherpa (#1) at times?  But unlike the Sherpa, you don't have a one-in-twenty risk of dying on any given workday.<br /><br />Manages a nice balance between the factual, \\"NYPD Harbor Unit: Body Recovery Detail\\" (#40), and satirical, \\"It's a Small World ride operator\\" (#3).<br /><br />A great gift for anyone who gripes about their job.	2004-12-29

Most have never experienced the depression, many have forgotten the days when communism was actually a threat.  We are blind to the absolutely crucial nature of how our world works.  Although we watched the stock market plummet in 1987 and have all learned valuable lessons from the internet boom & bust, I picked up this book because I wanted to know a bit more about how the scholars view capitalism.<br /><br />The book takes the reader through a history of capitalism while briefly summarizing everything you forgot from college economics.  While the discussion of the development of capitalism focused on some interesting questions of historical interpretation, the strength of this work is the description and analysis of how the capitalistic system works differently in different countries.<br /><br />The power of capitalism is set forth as its ability to adapt.  Where other systems--feudalism, communism, socialism, etc--failed was that they could not adapt to change.  The book was an excellent overview; it was current, easy to read, and contains a fine list of resources for further study.	2004-12-26

But after laying out all the facts the book just kind of stalled.  Assuming that the author was preparing to argue an hypothesis about the effects of progress on individuals and civilization I kept waiting for the book to draw some inferences about the future or to make a more detailed argument about how to deal with the advance of civilization.  What efforts by individuals and societal initiatives are the most rewarded by individual satisfaction and positive overall results?<br /><br />Perhaps the book's flaw was that the first part of the work cited to specific research showing how civilization has resolved many of its problems but then shifts into a much more general argument that the remaining problems can be solved if everyone decides to cooperate and play nice.  I was hoping to see many more specific recommendations.<br /><br />I still give the book 4 stars based upon the great first half and would not hestitate to recommend the book as a counterargument to the typical doom-and-gloom philosophy that is a staple of the op-ed page.	2004-12-24

The story reads very quickly and is deftly interwoven with a history of automata and commentary upon society's interaction with new technology.  (Once something gets boring--put it on the shelf for a few years and people will again pay for the experience.)<br /><br />The book becomes even more interesting when the author details the development of IBM's chess machine that actually fulfills the promise of the earlier machine--the \\"Turk\\".  Mr. Standage's rare ability to teach broad historical lessons in the context of a focused examination of an old \\"technology\\" makes this book a must read.<br /><br />Makes you wonder if in the future we will be reading books showing how our science-fiction (i.e. Star Trek) accurately presaged some yet to be developed technology.	2004-12-09

We all know what happened to the telegrapher; the implicit question being asked is what of our modern professions is destined for the same fate?<br /><br />This book highlights the various analogies between Victorian technology and the technology of the present.  While they appear so obvious upon reading, the honest reader will admit that Mr. Standage has unearthed many lessons lost over the years--not the least of which is the value of thinking big--thinking well beyond the capability of current technology.  Overall this book is an excellent primer in the oft-forgotten fact that history repeats itself and that the educated among us should seek a better understanding of the past before making decisions about our future.<br /><br />Mr. Standage's admiration for the feats of those who dared to think big enough to complete a transatlantic cable comes through strongly.  He strikes a wistful tone--like many others, he demonstrates that our present-day technology can achieve far more than we sometimes dare to think.	2004-12-08

I love this book--it provides a popularized introduction to the newest research into how we deal with the astonishingly rapid rise of available choices.  The opening dialogue is sobering--we live in a world of near infinite variety, where something as simple as purchasing a pair of jeans becomes a complex task worthy of examination.<br /><br />Mr. Schwartz takes the premise that the availability of choices comes with a psychic price--an intriguing notion that we are literally incapable of confronting our own world without instituting various defensive strategies that are only now yielding their secrets to research of the most creative and interesting sort.  (The book is worth reading just for its description of some of the more elegant social research strategies.)<br /><br />The happy and contented among us (who are also the more effective) have, according to Mr. Schwartz, managed to craft a strategy whereby choices are limited in advance by setting boundaries on what is chosen, by what process, and, especially, how much time and effort will go into any decision.  Imagine that!  A book that advocates self-restraint as a means to a more rewarding life and has science to back it up.	2004-12-06

I bought \\"Last Guardian\\" purely upon the strength of Mr. Wright's \\"Golden Age\\" trilogy and was pleased to find a work that stands quite independent of the \\"fantasy\\" label placed upon it.  Although the book suffers from volume one syndrome (and with the exception of Stephenson, I don't know why the market tolerates what is essentially serial publication) this book manages the feat of making the surreal seem both intriguing and plausible.  But be warned, just as you get a feel for the main characters and the gist of the story, volume one is over.<br /><br />The strength of \\"Last Guardian\\" lies in the author's ability to effortlessly draw upon a wealth of mythology within a contemporary setting.  The alternate world view develops very fast and while it can be difficult to keep track of the various beasts and characters taking their part in the story, the author skillfully creates a tension that draws you through the exposition without the story seeming to lag.<br /><br />Each of the characters are confronted with particularly thorny moral dilemmas and the author follows the struggles by highlighting their different world-views and ethical considerations.  Gifts always come with a price--and casual comments are binding, often at a frightful cost.  Especially enjoyable are the observations of an ancient character reborn into today's world who must struggle to interpret the modern technology and social mores.<br /><br />Mr. Wright has embarked upon a morality tale where private choices have public consequences; where promises kept result in great and powerful good and promises broken result in despair.  I anxiously await the next volumes.	2004-11-30

Kimball, twelfth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The Best Available Biography of an LDS Church President	Too often LDS biography suffers from an inability to develop the entire picture of an individual.  The laudable desire to focus on the positive often prevents the LDS biographer from telling the entire story.  Indeed, given the restrictions incumbent upon a prophet's biographers, this work could probably only have been written by President Kimball's sons; they have the unique perspective that allowed them to tell their father's story without ever seeming critical or unfair.  They remind us that before he was a prophet who traveled the entire world, he was their father, a young man from rural Arizona struggling to support a family.<br /><br />Do not misunderstand; Spencer Kimball was one of the most Christlike men to ever walk the earth--he did incredible work as the President of the Church.  But, he struggled with discouragement and overcame terrible adversity.  His humility and work ethic were born from his experiences--if only more LDS biographers could capture and describe the development of such integrity.  Instead, the reader of LDS biography is too often given a one-sided picture that makes it seem as if the subjects never battled with circumstance or conscience.<br /><br />The book is an easy and interesting read; it is appropriate for all ages and would be especially interesting for young men.  It is priceless because it does more than tell President Kimball's story, it teaches the reader the value of a testimony and what can be accomplished with faith and dedication.  It should be found on the shelf of every LDS home.	2004-11-22

But first, a word on \\"LDS Church Books\\".  Books are of the utmost importance in Mormon culture and follow a strict and complex hierarchy.  Of first rank are the scriptures--Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants and Pearl of Great Price.  These works are considered the \\"standard works\\" and serve as the measure of the orthodoxy of any other work.  The next level are works written at the express direction of Church leadership, such as Talmage's \\"Jesus the Christ\\" or which remain published exclusively by the Church, such as President Kimball's \\"Miracle of Forgiveness\\".  After these are works of General Authorities, which traditionally bear a disclaimer stating that any such book is entirely the responsibility of its author rather than a statement of Church doctrine.  Many excellent and worthy books are written by gospel historians, BYU Professors, Church Education personnel and others, but works by General Authorities have an implicit authority that derives from the mandate of their authors to be Special Witnesses of Christ.<br /><br />The largest subset of General Authority books are the \\"teachings\\" volumes, which generally summarize sermons and conference addresses.  Next you have volumes of exegesis and commentary concerning the standard works and various doctrines--most notable of which are those by Elder McConkie and Elder Maxwell, different styles, same message.  A fascinating and increasingly popular style are what I call Church Procedurals: primarily works such as those by Elder Gibbons which, though ostensibly biographies of Church Presidents, provide the best publicly-available record of the operation of the Church at the highest levels.  Another example would be \\"Pure Religion\\" by Glen L. Rudd.  But the rarest and my personal favorites are the autobiographical works.  (Elder Maxwell's \\"Moving in His Majesty and Power\\" falls squarely in this category.)<br /><br />Elder Pace manages in \\"Safe Journey\\" to hit the high points of every subcategory.  It is a sound and instructive blend of doctrine, Church History, procedure and biography.  And, despite its depth, it is a fun read.  We forget sometimes that the restoration is still happening--Elder Pace manages to reveal the frustration of leading the enthusiastic new African saints without in any fashion detracting from the Spirit.  He demonstrates that it the testimony of Jesus and His modern prophets that is truly essential to the work--all else is merely an appendage of lesser importance.  This work is also all the more powerful because it faithfully describes the Lord's process of bringing his blessings to a new people--it is primarily the story of the building of the Ghana temple.<br /><br />Elder Pace succeeds in telling an honest and complete story that is all the more fascinating for its portrayal of the many roadblocks both encountered and overcome in his administration of the Church in West Africa.  Some discouraging moments are shared for the purpose of highlighting the joy that follows when things are put right--which doesn't necessary happen on Elder Pace's schedule.  Elder Pace does not hestitate to share personal struggles and the value of this book lies in its author's willingness to share the lessons he has learned from his experiences in Africa.ints of every subcategory.

Reading this book is to experience the cold, creeping realization that something so horrible as a disease that literally liquifies its victims from the inside out, while they are still alive, is not only extant in our world but active.  Worse yet, nobody understands where the disease comes from or how it spreads.  You feel somewhat safe--but at the same time you can't discount the fact that the events set forth actually happened.<br /><br />The Hot Zone is a reference to the high-level biocontainment laboratories where the most virulent pathogens are studied.  The implication is that we live in a Hot Zone amidst an evolutionary battle that the germs are winning.  The author tells the story of the discovery and research regarding the Ebola virus; at one point actually taking you into a bat cave thought to be ground zero for the infection.  The story is written for effect more than to educate--but I can't think of a more effective way to generate interest in this most serious of subjects.<br /><br />This is a better thriller than any fiction; don't lend it out, it will get passed around to so many people you will have a hard time getting it back.	2004-11-19

Mr. Wright strikes an impressive balance between moving his narrative forward yet all the while bombarding the reader with astonishing and entirely original ideas.  Not since Dan Simmons' Hyperion (also a debut novel) have I seen a Sci Fi author take such command of his or her distinctive fictional creation.<br /><br />The Golden Age posits an infinite variety of intelligences, each with their own peculiar focus and means of relating to the world they inhabit.  The protagonist happens to be a recognizable human following the conservative Silver-Grey philosophy; a device allowing the reader to encounter the brave new world through eyes similar enough to our own.  Phaethon, our hero, has dreams bigger than his entire civilization, the book is obviously an Odyssey for the future--complete with a Chorus.<br /><br />Although the work constantly throws out original and creative speculation regarding the future, it doesn't forget to tell a story and does so very strictly within the expectations of classical fiction.  The Golden Age begins a masterful three-volume exposition of one of literature's primary themes--a uniquely gifted individual struggling to escape the strictures of a stagnant civilization.  The quest for knowledge and discovery has long been a staple of excellent Sci Fi.  What is so rewarding about the book is that the civilization at issue is so complex and diverse that the reader's understanding of the Oecumene (the future civilization) develops at the same pace as does the story.<br /><br />Mr. Wright is on my instant purchase list--this volume and its two successors are must-reads for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction.	2004-11-18

Such arguments have been going on regarding the Bible for thousands of years.  To this day half of the Bible (the New Testament) is disregarded as an unauthorized addition by Jews who reverence the Torah.  See, Deut 4:2.<br /><br />The Book of Mormon from its title page purports to be one thing--Another Testament of Jesus Christ.  New scripture from a God who is following the same pattern He has followed for generations; new scripture to complement the old.  The Book of Mormon is for persons who wonder why the Bible stopped--who wonder where the prophets have gone.  For a good long time the world wasn't ready to have a prophet.  In the 1830's, in a country with unlimited possibility and unprecedented religious freedom, God again revealed Himself to a prophet.  I find it curious that people who revere prophets such as Moses, Abraham, Daniel, the Apostle Paul and others will not test claims of a modern prophet.  I wonder if Isaiah had trouble distributing his book--it demands a close reading, was doctrinally controversial and probably disturbed the governing orthodoxy.  But that is the way God works, He allows us to decide whether to read the book.<br /><br />The Book of Mormon is the means given by God to test the veracity of the man who brought it forth--Joseph Smith.  It is a test--no more no less.  The Book of Mormon itself at Moroni Chapter 10 (the last chapter of the entire work) at verses 3-5 is instructive:  \\"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.  And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"<br /><br />So, instead of engaging in argument, test the Book.  Read it and ask God whether it is true.  I have.  It is.these things, and ponder it in your hearts. And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.  And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\" <br /> <br />So, instead of engaging in argument, test the Book.  Read it and ask God whether it is true.  I have.  It is. <br /> <br />	2004-11-17

It was ultimately worth the effort--difficult but very satisfying.  The work is more an argument in favor of Prof. Pink's philosophy than a dispassionate summation of this field of inquiry.  It is recommended not for the value of Prof. Pink's argument but as a compelling introduction to the subject itself.  Frankly, I have tried and abandoned several works in philosophy.  Recognizing that my difficulty arose from a lack of familiarity with the basic concepts and vocabulary of the discipline, I resolved to attempt the very short introduction and was pleased to find that it has primed me with concepts, ideas and an interest in pursuing further reading on the topic.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoy the philosopher's talent in finding hitherto unexplored depths in the most common of ideas; of focusing us on questions that have been glossed over.  While others will quibble about the particulars of the various doctrines presented in this work, it surpasses many other \\"overview\\" books in its painstaking introductions to the difficult ideas at issue and strikes an excellent introductory balance between detail and summary.  Herein lies its value; any introduction that leaves the reader with a desire to delve further into the discipline must be considered a success, \\"Free Will\\" accomplishes just that.	2004-11-15

A patient is placed into a coma, the blood and body chilled and then the heart actually stopped while the surgeon skillfully digs around in the grey matter.  Fascinating stuff.<br /><br />The author is a journalist obviously awed by Dr. Spetzler and all that he (and others) have accomplished at the Barrow Institute in Phoenix--the book is primarily a story of Dr. Spetzler's career and secondarily the developing science of neurosurgery.  The reader is treated to descriptions of the daily life of residents--rounds, M&M conferences, surgical procedures, etc.  There are the obligatory descriptions of the hideously expensive gadgetry and imaging technology that has made modern neurosurgery possible.  But something was missing.<br /><br />In attempting to simultaneously cover the entire field of neurosurgery (as well as a curious diversion into the history of Phoenix) this book lost some of its punch.  This could easily have been an incredibly interesting biography of Dr. Spetzler (and if anyone writes one--I'm buying it), or a surgical techno-thriller about standstill procedures curing otherwise hopeless cases .  Better yet, a treatise on the cost/benefit tradeoffs presented by modern medicine with its increasing dependence upon pricey machines.  Not to mention the peculiar danger of saving a patient from a horrible aneurysm only to find that his or her personality is irrevocably changed--and not for the better.  Unfortunately, the work was somewhat diluted by its lack of focus.  Nevertheless, highly recommended.	2004-11-15

Some 30 years ago I first encountered this book in my elementary school library and it remains vivid in my memory.  It is the story of a young boy, Mafatu, who lives on an island yet fears the sea that killed his mother years ago.  Mafatu decides to face his greatest and deepest fear--the sea--and sets off on an adventure, ending up not only conquering his fear of the sea but successfully confronting such life-threatening challenges as a hammerhead shark, a sharp-tusked wild boar and, finally, angry man-eating islanders.  It is the kind of story where just when you think things can't get worse, they do.  But Mafatu finds out that he is able to overcome every challenge and returns to his home island in triumph.<br /><br />Mafatu's story should be required reading for children preparing to face a world every bit as dangerous as the open ocean and filled with hazards no less serious than sharks and cannibals.	2004-11-11

I believe that much of Mr. Helprin's fiction evidences a deep frustration with the fact that we live amidst such richness of knowledge and opportunity in an incredibly beautiful world yet we fall prey to lesser enticements; we ignore or forget the truths upon which anything good and true must rest.  They are stories about discoveries of surpassing worth and importance.

Mr. Eidam admirably highlights the irony inherent in the fact that Bach produced such sublime art in the face of  continual opposition from lesser intellects.<br />I did not find the language of the english translation to be distracting and found the work to be refreshingly free of musical theory that while interesting does not increase one's understanding of the man himself.  Instead, the reader is left with a deep and abiding appreciation for Bach's untiring efforts, in the face of incredible opposition, to share with the world a miraculous music that only he could hear.	2003-11-17
