He does well bringing the economic and buisness realities to life, as well as the innovations needed to develop a movable type printing press.  Man seems rather a charismatic lecturer and writes in that style, which grates on me.  Also, his final chapters on the propagation of printing in Europe after Gutenberg lack the punch of the Gutenberg chapters and beg to be skipped by all except scholars of the period.  Ultimately, mildly interesting in places, but not a keeper.	2003-12-23

They trace the rise of the &quot;new&quot; (ie. bent on total annihilation) form of terrorism, particularly in Al-Quaeda.  They also elucidate the appeal of jihadism abroad.

Diamond looks beyond immediate and proximate causes to ultimate causes, i.e.. different areas on the globe had different &quot;starting materials&quot; in the way of domesticable plants and animals as well as a geography which aided or impeded the spread of ideas, crops, and animals.  In great detail, with strong logic, he traces the beginnings of civilization on all continents and supports it with ample evidence.  Great book.	2003-12-23

Nicholson begins with James's ascension, looks at the political atmosphere that commissioned the translation, then examines key translators and issues in the translation itself. In several places he gets specific about what choices the translators made, why they made them, and how subsequent translations flattened the word and failed to achieve either the grace or the depth of this one. I got a bit lost in some of the biographical stretches and in the many facets of the translators' lives, but overall I gained an appreciation not only for the KJ Bible, but also for the Jacobean society that produced - by committee - what I consider to be the greatest poetical work in the English language.  <br />Nicholson, too, I think manages to embrace the ambiguity of the characters in this drama - James I and the translators themselves, complex and controversial figures at best. He is able to see their evils and their genius, as he is able to see the genius and the weakness in the translation. The result was, for me, a rich and human canvas rather than a slick, or judgmental, treatise.	2003-12-23

He becomes the servant, then apprentice, of Bear - a juggler, ex-priest, revolutionary spy who envisions an England where peasants and laborers may regain their \\"ancient freedoms\\".   This is a quick, easy, fairly suspenseful read that brings Crispin's 14th century, Christian, surf mindset to life. You can see all the twists and turns coming, but maybe a 10-year-old couldn't. Unchallenging, but believable. I don't know why this won the Newberry award, unless it was to generally acknowledge Avi for his accomplishments. Still, a decent read, particularly for a student interested in medieval life. ages 10+	2003-12-23

This multiple-narrator novel provides a shifting portrait of a fictional New England Episcopal boarding school headmaster - a legend in his time.  It's like a Tom Brown's School Days for early 20th century New England, from the point of view of the headmaster.  The book provides an interesting contrast to the English Public School novel.  Among its questions: what does it mean to be a church school?  How should we educate boys into men, and what is a man?  Ultimately, it examines the uneasy tension between the idealistic, fervently faithful (and rather Puritanical) founder and the materialistic boys, parents, and board that make up the school.	2003-12-23

Multiple double-crosses and revelations ensue before the story finishes, 500 pages later.  Waters takes us through the worlds of London theives, dreary Victorian recluses, the erotica book trade, and madhouses before we're done, each terrifying and alluring in its own way.  Like Dickens at his best, she manages to give each charater complexity and avoid explicit judgement - even the villian Richard Rives is enticing at times.  She evokes, rather than discusses, the various ways women can be controlled and imprisoned, and lets us feel it through her two strong-willed heroines.

Kohler is good with creating an atmosphere where a hidden, horrible truth seems to lurk just outside the field of vision.  Unfortunately, the truth here is predictable and lacks impact.  Dodo, the 18 year old protagonist, floats passively and naively through the events of the novel, while the reader can see the other characters' machinations a mile away.  I actually found the hidden-children plot auxilliary.  The real story is Dodo's relationship with the de C's and their seductive duplicity.  The Vichy France revelation was just one more example of this, not the central event of the book, in my opinion.  Ultimately, I felt Kohler had all the elements of an evocative novel, including skilled prose, but that they didn't add up to much.  I finished it quickly, unmoved and unsatisfied.	2001-09-29

Lord of the Flies meets Picnic at Hanging Rock meets Walkabout meets the Wildfire Club.  I found Kohler's portait of girl-crushes at a remote boarding school evocative and compelling.  She uses setting well - the stiffling African heat followed by chaotic rain.  I was also intrigued by the 2nd person plural narration, and by the fact that one of the characters shared the author's name.  However!  The ending - oh the ending.  I didn't believe it for a second, not for those characters.  It was as if the author felt she had to have something appalling up her sleeve for the book to be worth it or didn't believe that less graphic betrayals can be deeper and more believable.  <br />Ultimately, I found this an intriguing novel, but I wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend it because of the disappointing ending.	2001-09-29

He writes well, journalistically.  This is vivid but not overly disgusting.  He understands the Japanese people and this compassion gives his biographies weight.  A fast, but disturbing read.  Middle School and up.	2001-03-22

It's much, much better than Karen Cushman's irritating gurl-power novels.  Chevalier strikes a believable balance in creating a strong female protagonist, but one who in many ways is under the power of others.  This quick read imagines the life of the teenage figure in Vermeer's painting of the same title.  Daughter of a tile artisan, she goes to work as a maid for the famous painter, enduring the politics of the household and of the courting butcher's son.  Some of the prose annoyed me in its self-consciousness, but this also helped create the character and period.	2001-03-22

Keaneally's portraits of Schindler and his adversary are exquisite.  It's easy to see how the actors in the movie got their inspiration.  If you liked the movie, this is an excellent accompaniment, as it explores the man, his life, and the history around him in much more detail than is possible even in the very long movie.  Even though I've read a lot about WWII, the Nazis, and the Holocaust (Hitler's Willing Executioners seems to have been an important influence for the writer), it was hard at first to follow the detail in the book, particularly the German terminology and SS ranks.  Ultimately, I didn't worry about that too much, and it didn't affect comprehension.  Keneally's main sources are personal interviews with &quot;schindlerjuden&quot; and the testimonies of same given to fact-finding courts in Israel right after the War.  This is the only story I know of that explores the fascinating idea of bribing, seducing, and schmoozing with the enemy to save lives.	2001-03-22

This traces the development of vulcanology in the US from the 1980 erruption of Mt. St. Helens through the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Phillipines in 1990s.  Fast paced, suspenseful, technical but accessable.  Now you can discuss pyroclastic flows with confidence.  My only complaint is that the photos were insufficient (too few, quality not great).  Still, you can go to USGS websites and download thousands.  I rented Dante's Peak while reading the St. Helens section and was surprised to find a lot of the book in the movie.  It made a wannabe vulcanologist out of me.	2000-11-18

This may or may not be as true as she presents, but her book makes good reading.  I raced through it with a tabliod curiosity.  Good photos too.  It puts a spin on all those expressions on the gymnasts' faces during the recent Olympic coverage.  Personally, I found her argument credible, though not a big surprise.  A fast read.	2000-11-18

This book was not as exciting or compelling as I expected, chiefly because the protagonits were unappealing and uncharistmatic.  I got the impression that the author was fascinated by all his research, but had a hard time culling detail to make a good book.  The information about the bureaucratic delays within the US government, for example, were interesting, but did not warrent anything like the amount of tedious detail they received.  I found myself constantly comparing the book to Lansing's Endurance (about the Shacketon expedition on the other pole), which was, in contrast, suspenseful, thrilling, and had a mesmerizing protagonist.  On the other hand, characters in GOCSabine do turn up in other stories of the period, such as Issac's Storm, so you can see what happened to them.  Overall, not worth much time.	2000-11-18

The only thing keeping me from a rating of 1 is the fact that she writes good prose and I kept thinking about the book once I'd finished it.  I like creative non-fiction, and I like discursive writing, and I like elusive connections - but come on, Annie.  Plus, this book's reflections on mortality depressed me.  It doesn't make me want to read her other stuff at all.  Oh snooooooooozzzzeeee!	2000-11-18

Keys does a lot of work uniting historical events around the globe in the 6th century AD.  I was also interested in the way he consulted other types of scientific experts to learn about events that might have happened then  (for example ice-core specialists).  He's onto a thesis that sounds  convincing.  I wonder what other historians of the period thought of the  book.  Unfortunately, from a reading perspective, he makes his point over  and over in each chapter (with each new example).  Presumably, this is to  build more and more evidence for this thesis - at times, though, it simply  sounds repetative and obsessed, weakening his credibility.  Still, worth a  read - or a skim.	2000-04-09

Interwoven with interviews of possible slaveship descendents in Jamaica and interviews with people who currently live in the  house in England where the shackles were made are Cottman's experiences  being part of a groundbreaking group of African American SCUBA divers.   Still, Cottman tried my patience as he grew more and more absorbed by his  personal journey - a journey which did not particularly draw the reader  closer to his subject.  For example, I would have liked more photographs of  his subjects and fewer of him in his scuba gear.  After a while, it felt  like... Here I am diving in Africa, here I am in Jamaica, here I am...  I  didn't learn much new about slavery, but I was interested in African  Americans trying to break into the world of scuba diving.  I could have  done without the deep-karmic-significance the project seemed to have for  the author.	2000-04-09

This was well written and particularly gave  a sense of the complexity of such a deep sea recovery venture, as well as  how long it takes.  The author is really into the mind of Tommy Thompson  (the recoverer) in all its non-conformist, innovative, genius.  So, a look  into a possibly genius mind, plus glances as the California gold rush, the  shipwreck itself (as narrated by survivors), the &quot;treasure  hunting&quot; industry, and the deep sea recovery industry.  Some  crossovers with The Perfect Storm (the shipwreck parts) and Blind Man's  Bluff (for deep sea technology - some of the characters from BMB appear in  SOG).  Detailed, scientific, historical, yet suspenseful and  very  readable!	1999-07-21

This is a suite of four story threads which intersect, but not in a very tesseract way.  I felt he didn't get the real idea of a tesseract, or else  used it cheaply.  This was a fine book, but not as exciting as The Beach.  However, readable and well-written.  As with The Beach, ignore flyleaf  accolades, as they are sickening and overdone.	1999-07-21

This account of his river adventures in Venezuela &quot;between the Orinoco and the Amazon&quot; is made witty by his dry English humor.  I particularly liked  the thin thread of his dreams of being back as a child rowing on the River  Avon with his father and discovering natural history there - an unexpected,  but fitting, contrast to the overtly perilous and ungentle places he's  visiting.  He has a habit of checking out of the interpersonal conflict by  describing the wildlife (esp. birds).  Unlike Tim Flannery (in Throwim Way  Leg), this is boringly written, confined mostly to physical descriptions  and comparisons with the data in his 19th century guide books.  He likes to  dramatize, humorously, the danger in the adventure, though I wonder if this  isn't really a cover for his lack of understanding of the people around  him.  I found the conflicts with Simon (his nightclub manager, cockney  friend from &quot;civilization&quot;) and the other guides most  interesting.  Also promising were the interactions with the Yanomami,  though Redmond is nowhere near as perceptive or penetrating as Flannery is  with the Papua New Guinea tribes.  I came away from the book feeling that  he might have missed the point of the people he was with and the Yanomami,  but that he found a gentle, unassuming meaning for himself in the modest  framework of his childhood.	1999-07-21

It's actually a technical cog-sci evolution book, and somewhat disappointing.  The last chapter  summarizes what Johnston says in a complicated, redundant way for the rest  of the book.  The strong points are: his explanations of evolutionary  opportunism, how evolution works, his &quot;face prints&quot; computer  program, and the various computer models that simulate selection and  genetics.  His thesis is that the brain structures that allow emotions have  evolved because they aided survival and thus gene reproduction.  The  feelings we have today were therefore necessary in ancestral environments,  though not necessarily in modern environments.  He also discusses the role  of learning (which allows us to adapt to changing environments).  Also  interesting, his presentation of sensations and emotions, not as realities  in the outside world (there is no &quot;redness&quot;, only light waves),  but as brain-created realities which don't necessarily mirror reality  accurately, but in fact amplify some things to aid survival.  I wonder if  Jared Diamond does it better in The Third Chimpanzee?	1999-07-21

The boy, Haroun, has a father who is a professional storyteller (the Shah of Blah).  His father loses his ability to tell stories when his wife runs off with the dry civil servant upstairs.   Haroun eventually travels to the moon of stories where he finds he must  help save the princess and the Ocean of the Streams of Story, both  threatened by the evil cultmaster of silence.  Lots of wordplay and  reflection on storytelling in general.  Sort of an adult Phantom Toll  Booth.  Not very suspenseful, but lots of fun.  Appropriate for ages 10 and  up.	1999-07-21

Feng includes  victims, perpetrators, &quot;non-participants.&quot;  Particularly  fascinating/ horrifying is the chapter about the infamous #63 torture  block.  The author also includes some striking, though possibly one-sided,  interviews with people born post-1976.  Feng himself seems to have a bit of  a saviour complex, and his commentary struck me as overdone and interfering  - particularly the trite maxims he insists on including after each  narrative.  He is most interesting in the interview at the end of the book,  during which he discusses his methodology and &quot;Documentary  Literature&quot;.  <br />Chihua Wen's oral histories of children during the  Cultural Revolution (The Red Mirror) is less varied, but has a lighter  touch, and therefore comes off as more richly poetic.  Cheng Jung's Wild  Swans is a good companion to these oral history style books, as it offers a  detailed and incisive analysis along with its personal story.   Ten Years  of Madness is a good collection of narratives, but I wish Feng's commentary  had been more analytical and less Holy.	1998-08-23

The author writes in English and translates the  narratives herself, which gives the book a poetic unity, made even more  enjoyable by the fact that she writes well.  Unlike Feng Jicai's Ten Years  of Madness, Chihua Wen's own writing is evocative, complementary,  unintrusive, and poetic.  The narratives aren't as diverse as Feng's, but  the writing here is better.	1998-08-23
