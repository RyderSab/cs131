Wilken shows how the early church interacted with early Hellenized thought.     These early theologians created a new world of thought that they used to seek the face of God. The author compared and contrasted early theologians masterfully. He not only gave the reader a glimpse into the church fathers' theological arguments, but their spiritual lives as well. Some of the topics the book covered are the trinity, all three members of the trinity, scripture, faith and reason, happiness, virtues, and love.     I can not think of a better introduction to pre-medieval theology and the book challenges me spiritually as well. It made me yearn more to seek the face of God.	2005-10-08

Colson narrates stories about his life experiences and the life experiences of others to very good effect. He also uses Lewis's moral arguments and the logical design arguments to argue for the truth of Christianity. The book, by its very nature, has to present these arguments at a superficial level. The book keeps refering to different movie plots, especially \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" To argue truth from a fictional movie plot doesn't work for me; thus, I substracted a star.    The book does a remarkable job of presenting the reasonableness of Christianity and how Christianity is the only way to meet man's need for meaning. It would be a good book to give to non-believing friends.	2005-09-21

He was a fascinating man. According to this account, Roosevel was pure energy. He read \\"Anna Karenina\\" while chasing crooks in the Dakotan wilderness during the middle of winter. He wrote a 64,000 word biography on Cromwell in less than a month. During that month he met with the President and various political officials. He could dictate both the book and his memos at the same time, while being shaved. He was amazing man. He exemplified the United States at the start of the 20th century: dynamic, destiny-filled, and stubborn. He had a near photographic memory. He was very good at losing money. The books recorded in detail his many strengths and weaknesses.    The book is well researched and footnoted. The writing is extremely easy to read. Morris very wisely sticks to the subject: Teddy. There are no long side trips to the political/cultural milieu of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Morris spares a paragraph here or there to describe the situation, but he uses Roosevelt's own words or the words of his witnesses to explain the story. The writing is extremely well done. It is crisp. The run on sentences are kept to a minimum. It is the best biography I have read. The book is 740 pages long, but I remember being reluctant to put it down every time I had to go to work, church or eat. The book is amazing experience.	2005-09-05

She knows she's weird, but she also can't understand why everyone is not as fascinated as she is with presidential assasinations. Her precocious and morbid nephew is fascinating as well.     She has a fond affection for Garfield and McKinley. She worships Lincoln. She totally hates G. W. Bush. She humanizes the assassins without excusing them. She likes to tie the assassinations together by showing the historical thread.     It is a very remarkable book. I disagree with her on several points, but I am fully entertained at all times. The depth of scholarship is amazing and her journey to different historical sites provides a list of potential vacation sites for history buffs that will last for years.	2005-08-20

The book advocates bringing people into the community and then teaching them doctrinal beliefs. Getting a point-in-time decision is not as important as incorporating the non-believers into the church and slowly teaching them to live as a Christian and learn our language. A Faithful life is more important than a point-in-time questionable decision. Correct doctrine is important, but teachng them the whole truth as they grow in a Christian community is the better way to go. This book help me to think through the theology of outreach that a church should have.	2005-08-07

The book uses the match as a microcosm to illumine the political environment at the time. The writing is crisp and thoughtful. The explanation of the individual games was kept to a minimum.

I learned a lot of information about Kepler, Kepler's family, the thirty-years war, and the counter-reformation. The writer's prose was very readable; however, the book lacked cohesion. The book had very little information concerning with Kepler developing his scientific theories and his search for harmony. The author jumped off on bunny trails for scores of pages without mentioning Kepler. He would write about the thirty years war and the political machinations that led up to it. He would then return to the witch trial of Kepler's mother. He would then breifly spend a little time on Kepler developing his theories and how it relates to his faith. The book seemed repetitious at times. Maybe bacause the witch trial went on for so long, but the book returns again and again to that same topic and how worried and frantic Kepler was.    I had a hard time finishing it. The book was a hard read. At the end, I had a hard time placing  all the pieces together. The topic was fascinating and the author did provide some interesting tidbits, but the narrative thread was hard to follow.	2005-07-28

I have had several arguments with passionate friends about free will.  I am a big fan of \\"Evangelism and The Sovereignty of God\\" by Packer. I have read this book twice. At the first reading, I was disgruntled with Sproul for critiquing Packer. After the second reading, I tend agree with Sproul. In other words, Sproul is fairly persuasive.    This book is a very good introduction to Calvinism and predestination. I have read other reviews about how this book persuaded people to accept Calvinism, but I do not know if it would have persuaded my Arminianist friends. However, Sproul does write clearly and writes to the lay reader. He focuses on explaining the concepts and a little bit of the historical context. He uses his own experiences of \\"converting\\" to Calvinism  to good effect. He understands the difficulties in believing Calvinism and tries to address them. My criticism is that he could have better explained the scriptural passages within their context. He does this somewhat, but many times he quotes a verse and moves on. He uses rhetoric more than scriptural reasoning at times to prove his point. However, the book does a good job of explaining the beauty of Calvinism and its scriptural foundation. Sproul does not explain everything. Some of it is a mystery, but he does gives hints as how God remains just in the light of predestination.	2005-07-23

It covers world views, Evangelical Christian theology and history, Intelligent Design, women's roles, and other topics. The author wants you think about if Christianity is true, to quote Schaeffer, \\"How Should We Then Live?\\" She is a fan of Schaeffer and C. S. Lewis. She uses Schaeffer's model of the history of culture as the basis of her own model. I do not agree with all the conclusions the author makes, but the book does make me think through how to live more consistently with my Christian world view. The author challenges the reader to think and tries to bring Jesus Christ into every aspect of the reader's life.     The writer's style is very readable. It is a long book; however, it is hard to put down.	2005-07-12

We play games that are based on the players' previous year's numbers. This book is meat and potatos to me. If you are a serious fan of the game and you like to check stats, splits, and trends, this book is great. The author gives the history of the obsession with baseball numbers  and the development of a multi-million dollar industry of baseball statistics. He gives short biographies of the people who developed the measurements like ERA, BA, OBP, OPS and zone ratings. He tells of the immeasureable mental energy and effort of fanatical baseball fans who collected the statistics. The book is hard to put down. It is a fascinating read if you have any interest in numbers, baseball or human behavior.  <br /> <br />I would take a 1/2 star off for some typos and clumsy writing style. The silly figures of speech were hit and miss, but for the most part, they were amusing. The book was a fun read and I enjoyed it immensely.	2005-06-04

Neither story line held any interest for me. I kept expecting substance in each new story, but each myth or legend seem bland. The story of the boy seemed nonsensical. The best part of the book is the language. The writer does write very fluently with a deft use of figures of speech. However, this seems a little off as well. One story the author really brings ancient Ireland alive, but then uses an extended simile of the Titanic. It broke the magic for me.     Perhaps I missed the hidden symbolism and meaning, but I gave up after about 1/2 through. I would give the book only one star for the plot, but the writing was very good so I gave it another star.	2005-05-14

Humboldt traveled and studied everything: geology, botany, sociology, geography, anthropology, archaeology, and astronomy. He created a new science, plant geology. He traveled all over South America and Central America. He was well loved everywhere he went. The book was a spellbinding read.     The only minor downside of the book is it does drag in the middle. Humboldt travels to many places and the author almost does a day-by-day journal. The amount of detail and the hundreds of locations just gets boring, but I stress, on the whole, the book relates a fascinating story about the most fascinating forgotten man in history. Putting the book down is hard.     To understand modern science, this book is a must read. This one man influences the development of almost every branch of science and contributes to the abolishment of slavery in several different countries. The book provides a glimpse into history that I thoroughly enjoyed.	2005-05-02

I thought Dickens's novels had plot lines that were well entwined, but this novel is truly intricate. The main characters are well drawn: Anna, Levin, Kitty and Vronsky are all very believable characters. There is not a badly drawn character in the book. Furthermore, the novel gives an interesting picture of 19th century Russia from farm life to city life to metropolitan life.<br /><br />The translation is very readable. It has strange word choices sometimes. The translators tend to use technical terms to describe professions and classes, but the translators have written fairly good footnotes and endnotes. On the whole, the translation flows easily and is very enjoyable.	2005-03-07

Lewis: The Gift of Friendship	Books	3	12	13	N	Y	Parallel Biographies	The book introduces chapters with fictional vignettes of their lives that might have happened. This approach is a mixed blessing. Who really cares what may have happened in a biography? This approach does make the book an easy read. Duriez  presents the lives of both of the men fairly accurately. He even tries to correct the common misconceptions of these two great men. Duriez asserts the men were friends to the end of their lives and they were not estranged by Lewis's marriage to Joy. Duriez writes all long friendships go through peaks and valleys. I tend to agree. I am well read in both Tolkien and Lewis and Duriez summarizes the plot lines of the some of the most well known books fairly well. The book is good as far as it goes. It even reveals some insights that I didn't know before, especially about Tolkien.     However, the book is more like parallel biographies rather than the tracing their friendship and how that friendship influenced their writing. The information in this book is presented far better in other places. Duriez really does not present anything new and interesting about Lewis and Tolkien in these pages. Sayer's biography of Lewis does a better job of presenting the influences on Lewis. Carpenter's book \\"The Inklings\\" does a better job of describing the friendships. Carpenter's biography of Tolkien tells the details of Tolkien's life far better. Duriez does not bring a fresh perspective.     I have quibbles about some of the facts in the book. The most glaring one is that Duriez asserts that Tolkien decided to change Bilbo's name to Bilbo from something else while he was writing the Lord of the Rings. \\"The Hobbit\\" was already published while he was writing the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien  could not very well have changed Bilbo's name. It's possible that The Lord of the Rings was being developed before the Hobbit was published, but from Duriez own words the publisher was pushing Tolkien to write a sequel to the Hobbit and so Tolkien started work onThe Lord of the Rings. Duriez must have meant something else or needs to clarify.     If you have not read a biography of Lewis or Tolkien, this book would be a good start. It is slightly repetitious and obvious, but it stays interesting.  However, better books are out there on these men.	2005-03-05

The book described the exotic locations rather well. The master villian was interesting, in a way. The plot pressed forward with enthusiasm.     I do have several gripes. I don't understand why the author included Holmes. He does very little and makes very few decisions. He isn't a master sleuth in this book, rather he is a disguise artist and a very good magician. The plot has no mystery and no puzzles for Holmes to solve. Thus, it is not the best non-Doyle Holmes that I've read, but there are a lot worse out there. My other gripe is the heroine. She is too perfect. She is an expert marksman, a very skilled equisterian, an accurate knife thrower, extremely bright and cute. I can't see a flaw in her, and this makes her a tad boring.    There are a few plot holes and nonsensical reasoning. Some of the action scenes are poorly described. However, most mysteries have these flaws. The book is better than cotton candy for the mind, but not much.	2005-03-04

He does all the voices and the sound effects.

It covers the Reformers, the counter-Reformation in the Catholic church, the Anglican church, and the spread of the church throughout the world between the late 1400s and the early 1700s. Even so, it is an useful and fascinating book.     There are negatives. I am not a historian, but I have some non-academic criticisms. The author comes off as condescending sometimes. His attempts at humor is hit and miss at best. He had a couple chapters on sex and love he could have left out. His observations and conclusions on those topics did not really enlightened me. I know I am asserting that he covered too much ground, but I wished he talked about the 18th century some more. I wanted to see more on how church leaders like Edwards and the Wesleys fit into the overall scheme of things. However, he asserts the Reformation age was over by 1700.     The book is incredibly ambitious. McCulloch wrote well and I learned some theology as well. I wished he had picked a more specific topic, there was just too much to absorb and he covered too many topics superficially.	2004-12-06

I read the book aloud to my wife and we agreed with the principles.  There are some passages (very few) that are very moving. However, there are several minor things that bother me about the book. First, he repeatedly refers the reader to the appendix for more resources. The resources are all \\"Purpose Driven\\" resources. This was annoying. Second, he uses multiple translations and paraphrases. It was confusing and some of the paraphrases were bad paraphrases.  He has his reasons, but I do not agree with him: his tendency is to get a translation of a  verse that agrees with his point, rather let scripture speak for itself. Third, he puts the scriptural reference as end notes, rather than footnotes. This was annoying. Fourth, he has a clumsy writing style. He writes like he preaches: he is very repetitive. In other words, makes the very same point in several different ways. <br /> <br />Admittedly, these problems are minor. It took me a while to figure out what really bothered me about the book. The book is \\"Christianity Lite.\\" It does not delve into the Christian truths very far. For example, he does not really explain sin and need for redemption.   <br /> <br />Another example, one of the major problems is that Warren does not reference the resurrection. In a book of this type, it should be one of the central themes. Warren writes that God created you for a purpose. Warren does not cover how Christ dying for us and His resurrection gives us hope and meaning in our lives. <br /> <br />The book has good insights and it is a good discussion guide, but it does not engage the mind.	2004-10-24

When I started reading this book, I kept asking myself, \\"Who is the audience?\\" People well read in Lewis will know most of the material presented. People who are curious about Lewis should just read Lewis. To me this book is just a good reference work for some limited applications.    The author does present the material in a very accessible form. He writes in a very clear and friendly manner. He has short chapters on different topics like marriage, sex, salvation, God, and the incarnation. You can tell the author's real affection for Lewis's writings. The real advantage of this book is that the author references materials that the average fan of Lewis does not read: the letters, sermons and talks. Another benefit of this book is that the author shows how Lewis changed his theology over his life time.    The main problem with the book is, using Lewisian terms, the book spends too much time \\"looking at,\\" instead of \\"looking alongside.\\" The book feels too much like a research paper and does not encourage the reader to enjoy the magic of Lewis for themselves.     I have a website on C. S. Lewis and I get questions all the time about these topics. Frankly, this book is much better than my website and I will probably quote from it in my FAQ section. If you have questions about what Lewis believed on certain theological topics, this book will be a very good guide. However, reading Lewis is the very best method and the most fun way to find out what Lewis thought.	2004-10-04

A senior demon instructs a junior demon on how to handle a soul. Lewis provides surprisingly deep spiritual insights using this format and humor as well. This book provides convicting lessons on humility, temptation, marriage, fellowship, and true Christianity. The book has been often imitated but never surpassed.      John Cleese's performance is excellent. He brings out the nuances of the text. He enhances the humor and pathos. The perfectly timed smacking of the lips from Screwtape is worth the price of the tape. Clesse richly deserved the grammy he earned for this performance.       This tape would be a great introduction to Lewis, if you never read him before. If you are Lewis fan, you will truly treasure the tape.	2004-09-23

It is not an evaluation of atheism as an intellectual belief system or a worldview, but rather a critique of atheism as a socio-political and intellectual movement in history. McGrath quickly dismisses the arguments for and against God's existence as too close to call. He focuses on the brand of atheism that started with Feuerbach and was propagated through the writings of Darwin, Freud and Marx. At the risk of oversimplification, it is the belief that not only that God does not exist, but that if society could only get rid of belief in God and religion in general that the world would be a much better place. Christianity oppresses the weak and poor. If we rid humanity of these false beliefs, humankind will naturally learn to live together. The fullest of expression of this brand of atheism in history is communism.     McGrath is not saying that atheism could not eventually create a utopia, but he is saying that if you look at the track record in history, atheism produced oppressive and intolerant governments just as bad as Christianity. He presents his theories of why this brand of atheism caught fire and why this brand of atheism has begun to fizzle out in this day of postmodernism.     He also looks at Darwin's and Freud's legacies. He touches on the pitfalls of naturalistic Darwinism and the shortcomings of therapy that does not include the spiritual aspects of man.     He also challenges the theory of Christianity and religion in general will not be propagated to future generations. He not only gives a few statistics, but he gives a case study of the O'Hair family. His criticism of Madalyn O'Hair is not that she was a prime example of an atheist, but rather if atheism is to help humankind to be morally better, why did her organization suffer as much infighting and backstabbing as any Christian organization?    I like McGrath's writing. I always find him clear, entertaining and challenging. He quotes extensively. He tries to put the quote in its historical context and tries to express the author's meaning. The part I like best about the book is showing how Protestantism contributed to the rise of Atheism. He challenges the current church to avoid the cold intellectualism of the past, which makes God distant and uncaring. He admires the Pentecostal church movement in this regard.     There are some criticisms about the historical inaccuracies. I am not a historian, but I have read the writings of Darwin and Freud, and Marx. McGrath did not misrepresent them. I admit there are run-on sentences, but not that many.  I am  knocking off a star, because I do not agree with some of his conclusions and because the remarks in the other reviews about the editing are probably true.	2004-09-17

They told me it has changed their lives. The principles about living in the light are really good and should be stressed in this day and age where sin is considered an outdated concept even in Christian circles. I knocked one star because even though it is only around a hundred pages, it seemed repetitious to me. The phrase \\"the blood of Christ\\" was used so much it almost became a mantra. Yes, it is the central concept of Christianity, but there is more to the Christian walk. The Church and the fellowship of believers is important as well.  <br /> <br />It is definitely worth another read and perhaps it will grow on me. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

This one is by far the best. Sayer had a long friendship with Lewis and tells what he knows about Lewis and does not theorize about what he does not know. The reader feels the warmth and respect Sayer has for Lewis and also the puzzlement one has with close friends whose strange behaviors in the past are not fully explained.  <br /> <br />Sayer addresses the C. S. Lewis's friendship with Tolkien, Dyson and other Inklings. Sayer does a good job of relating Lewis's conversion to Christianity. Sayer explains the arguments and personal struggles that surrounded the conversion. Sayer writes about Joy and Mrs. Moore, which gives a more fuller and more generous picture of both women than some other biographies. Sayer has the background for literary criticism and writes about Lewis's poetry, the Chronicles of Narnia and most of his other writings.  <br /> <br />The style of the writing is easy to read and accessible.

He addresses immorality of any form. I found the book challenging morally and sound scriptually. I disagreed with him only in a few minor points in exegesis. He is the more of the throw a verse at it, rather than exegete a whole passage, but he does use a lot a scripture. He focuses on you must hate the sin. You must place God absolutely first in your life: above your reputation and above your embarassment before you can conquer the sin. Only God can bring a man to this point in his life. The principles are simple and are hard to implement, but I believe them to be sound. If nothing else the author challenges you to really think about what it means not to be conformed to the world.	2004-08-02

The book then described the Jacobean era. It was a complex era of opposing forces and King James was a man who tried to unite his kingdom. King James appointed several teams of translators to translate the Bible. The translation itself was to be an irenicon. The book described the personalities of several of the translators. Some were holy and some were assuredly not holy. The author then tried to show how the translation affected our culture to this day.  <br />The writing is well done and the story is fascinating. My only small criticism is that the author made some rather weak conclusions to show how the different influences contributed to the book. The book shows the author's love for wording and cadences of the King James version. At times, the author's effusiveness is  irritating, but the book is always entertaining and informative. The author's love for the language of the King James version is  contagious.	2004-07-19

His style is very readable. The first chapters are especially good. I never knew how Aristotle was re-introduced into the intellectual community of Western Europe in the middle ages. His description of the faith versus reason (Aristotle's teaching) struggle over the centuries is very interesting. However, the book drags towards the end. The author repeatedly makes the same points in the final chapters. His thesis is that we can learn from Aristotle and from history methods and attitudes that will unite faith and reason in our present day. However, his conclusions are confusing to me. <br />The book as a whole gave me a better understanding of the faith versus reason struggle and how it started long before Galileo's dispute with the Catholic church.	2004-07-10

I rarely finish them. This biography I finish. It is very readable. Marsden covers Edwards's life and times very well. He addresses the theology and summarizes Edwards's writings. It is a fascinating read. I know very little about Church history in pre-revolutionary America and this book is a very good introduction.	2004-07-07
US	52816088	R34XLWUQLGYUR9	0310241448	911984495	The Case for a Creator: A Journalist Investigates Scientific Evidence That Points Toward God	Books	3	15	21	N	Y	A Deluge of Information	The author presents a lot of evidence for the creator. He interviews many specialists and I enjoy the format of the presentation. I have a degree in physics earned many years ago so the astronomical and astrophysical evidence interested me the most. He also presents evidence in biology, genetics, and geology. The book's main focus is intelligent design, but the book presents other evidence as well. The evidence presented is hit and miss, but so much evidence is presented, I think there are some solid hits. <br />The material is not always easy, I am still mulling over the William Craig Lane chapter. He disagrees with the Hawkins's model for the start of the Big Bang. Lane's mix of Aristotelean philosophy and modern physics to me has always been uneasy mix.  <br />His other books to me are more personal and perhaps a more useful apologetic, but this book is more fun to me. The amount of information he doles out in sundry branches of science gives me at least some tools to talk to my scientific minded friends.<br />I am knocking off a couple stars because some of the writing and some of the interviews seem clumsy. I would give it another 1/2 star if I could.	2004-07-05

The book referenced a large sample of the Lewis corpus. His approach to the Space Trilogy and how we can use Lewis to make bridges to the New Agers was very interesting. I knocked a star off because of his writing style. It was very uneven. At times it seemed forced and at other times it was inspired. The section on the deconstruction of language lost me, but that may be due to my lack of study in that area. His love of the fiction of Lewis came through very strong. I wanted to drop everything and read the Space Trilogy again.	2004-06-26

I have read some Kreeft before and I enjoyed his writings. However, these essays are boring. I could not get through them. The essays have very little to do with what Lewis thought and a lot to do with what Kreeft thinks about. What's more after the first essay, I could care less what Kreeft thinks about. I would suggest that you reread &quot;Abolition of Man&quot; again and save your money.	2004-06-06

In other words, he shows how each successive time period builds on the previous time periods. The books presents an exciting unity of the Old Testament using the promises and the covenants. The books helps place each O.T. book in its historical context. This book is fundamental in understanding Walter Kaiser's approach to theology or O.T. theology in general.	2004-03-17

The plots intertwine beautifully. The characters are as unique and stark as Greenland. The characters stay with you long after you turn the last page.	2004-02-17

McGrath quotes theologians, writers and poets throughout the ages to present their views on heaven. It is a short, but very entertaining and challenging read. McGrath, like C. S. Lewis, makes us yearn for heaven and thus, makes our pilgrimage on earth more bearable.	2004-02-02

Lewis	Walter Hooper was a companion of Lewis in his last days and a long time student of C. S. Lewis works.  This book shows his affection and knowledge of Lewis.  It covers every book and work.  It answers the common questions  people have about the life and writings of Lewis.  I recommend Hooper's  book as an indispensable tool to have on the serious Lewis scholar's or  just the curious C. S. Lewis fan's bookshelf.	1999-03-08
