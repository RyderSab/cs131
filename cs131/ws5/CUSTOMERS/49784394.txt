She loved it and asked for it over several months.  She loved pointing to her nose, eyes, and mouth, and playing 'peekaboo' with Blue on the last page.  I don't recall any confusion regarding nose and mouth.  The book was interactive enough to be a real hit at the early toddler stage, plus it reinforced some very basic body vocabulary words.	2003-12-21

It is a warm, humorous coming-of-age story, featuring Clay-Boy and his multitude of red-haired younger siblings growing up in Appalachia.  The story centers around the fact that Clay-Boy (yes, an aspiring writer) wants to go to college, and his rural family must find a way to send him.  He also discovers girls and the fickleness of young love, while his parents struggle with the financial hardship of the Depression years.  Semi-autobiographical novel by Earl Hamner, Jr., on which the Waltons was based.	2003-11-03

I disagree with those who have said that if you're an animal lover, you won't like it.  I am an animal lover, and I thought this was a profoundly pro-animal book.  The wolves who befriend Julie and help her survive become her friends in the truest sense; the ending is sad and tragic *because* we have come to love the wolves with her.  I think the book has a strong message about the importance of respecting and living in harmony with nature.  Although I read this book many years ago, I still remember it, and I gave it to my animal-lover niece when she was about 11.  She loved it, too.	2003-11-01

When I was in the third grade, my brother (a fifth grader at the time) loved it and suggested I would like it also, even though it was \\"a boy's book\\".  So, I read it and I did love it!  35+ years later, I don't remember much of the story, but I remember a sense of excitement and intrigue--and I remember it now as one of the few \\"boys' books\\" I enjoyed in elementary school.  It may be that times have changed and there is less patience now with stories that begin slowly, or it may be that this book will appeal primarily to select readers.	2003-11-01

I read Strawberry Girl when I was around 7, and I loved it.  I think it introduced me to a rural poverty that was otherwise out of my experience, and left me with a sense of empathy for people whose lives were very different from my own.  Nearly 40 years later, I still remember it.	2003-11-01

The pictures are bright and uncluttered, and the text is repetitive and simple and focuses on common, everyday objects (Clifford barks at his dish, at the cat, at the fish, at the birds in the trees, and so on).  In other words, it is perfect for the youngest readers.  She liked it so much that I bought her several other Clifford Puppy books (she had never seen the TV series), but this one was always her favorite.	2003-11-01

I think it helps her label and understand her own feelings when things don't go the way she wants them to.  As for it teaching kids to \\"run away\\" when they are angry--that's not the way I read it.  To me, it describes getting out and doing something physical (running, then climbing a tree), and then enjoying nature, as a way to cope with angry feelings.  My daughter also seems to find it deeply satisfying when Sophie goes back inside to a warm home where people are happy to see her, and she is able to join in the family's activities again, with no hard feelings.  I think it's important for preschoolers to understand that angry feelings can be coped with and survived without harming either individuals or relationships.	2003-10-15

Mother Goose nursery rhymes are part of our cultural heritage.  The beautiful, colorplate illustrations in this original, oversized volume will make many of these rhymes especially memorable.  Unfortunately, the rhymes are densely packed, with several on each page, and thus the majority do not have accompanying illustrations.	2003-10-13

I purchased this for my two-year old Dora-fan daughter, thinking it was a book.  Now I see that it is variously called a \\"puzzle book\\" and a \\"jigsaw puzzle\\".  As far as I can tell, however, it is a *coloring book*.  It as actually perfectly fine as coloring books go, with a variety of pen-and-pencil activities built into it (\\"Now we have to search the Squirrel Trees for our friends.  Trace the path that will take us there\\"), but I really was not expecting it to be a coloring book, and so was disappointed when it arrived.	2003-10-07

Basically, Caillou spends a lot of time in the book saying \\"no\\" to everything and being very whiny.  It seems to have helped her let go of some of this behavior in herself.  As with the other Caillou books, I do a fair amount of editing as I read, so that the story better reflects our own situation.  I give it 5 stars based on her enjoyment of it, and on the extent to which it seems to have helped us deal with this issue in our own lives.	2003-10-02

I understand that Brown Bear, Brown Bear is a classic, much-loved board book, and I fully expected my daughter to love it as well.  I had a copy of it waiting for her on her shelf when I brought her home, and I tried reading it to her numerous times between her first and second birthdays.  However, she has simply never been very interested in it. She seems to get bored by the repetitiveness of the text, and usually just wants to skip to the last page where all the participating animals (and teacher) are identified.  I have tried introducing her to other Eric Carle books as well, and she has responded to all of them in this same way (in contrast, she loves Dr. Seuss, Baby Einstein, Mem Fox, and Boynton board books).  At 24 months, she is now into picture books like Olivia and Corduroy, so I think that our copy of Brown Bear, Brown Bear is destined for charity.  It is a good reminder to me that not all classic books are equally loved by all children, and it may be worth ascertaining what your own child likes before making a purchase.	2003-10-01

At one, the text was too advanced for her, but we would talk about the pictures--object names, colors, and other things she could relate to.  I think when she's a little older, she'll still enjoy the pictures, but will also be able to appreciate the text.  From my perspective, a \\"baby book\\" that lasts beyond babyhood is pretty rare.  Her Baby Einstein books are among the few of her \\"baby board\\" books that we are keeping so she can enjoy them again when she's older.	2003-09-30

She loved it, and asked for it again and again.  The text was definitely too advanced for her at that age, but she loved looking at the bright, colorful pictures, and talking about them.  I think she will appreciate the text more as she grows older--and I think it's remarkable that she has some baby books that will actually grow with her through preschool!	2003-09-30

Each page has an engaging drawing and a simple sentence about what friends do together (e.g., laugh, sing, play, share).  My daughter especially enjoyed doing the sound effects written on each page (e.g., \\"hahaha\\", \\"lalala\\", and so on), and we would talk about friends in her life that she had done these various fun things with.  It was a very nice book to read together, very interactive.	2003-09-30

It counts to five using easy to understand rhymes and pastel drawings of familiar animals (bunnies, kitties, butterflies, ladybugs, etc.).  She asked for it every night for weeks.  At the time, she had never seen a Blue's Clues episode, so her liking of the book was not due to already liking the character of Blue.	2003-09-30

It was this book that she wanted to hear night after night for weeks on end.  Each page has big, colorful pictures and a few easy to understand sentences describing the highlights of a baby's typical bedtime routine--getting into jammies, looking at a book, cuddling a stuffed animal, getting a goodnight kiss.

At one, I doubt my daughter could have enjoyed a full-length Curious George book.  This was a wonderful way to introduce her to the character and whet her appetite for more when she is older.	2003-09-21

She is just two now, and we are beginning to read some of the adoption storybooks I have collected for her.  This is by far and away her favorite right now.

We usually read it at bedtime, since the third story features a little girl who falls asleep and is put to bed by her mom.  The stories are sweet and feature tender, affectionate relationships.  I also appreciate the book's multicultural aspect, as my daughter is adopted from Asia, and she seems to especially like the third story, which features an Asian child.	2003-08-31

It seemed to help her understand and accept more easily that I can't always play with her when she wants.  As with the other Caillou books, I edit judiciously as I read so that it more closely reflects our own situation.  First, the story focuses almost exclusively on Caillou's relationship with his father; as a single mother, I edit this so that it reflects my daughter's own experience of wanting to spend more time with Mommy.  Second, Caillou does a few things in this book (throw pillows for fun, race cars on the kitchen table) that I don't particularly want my daughter copying, so I edit them out as well.  I give it five stars based on her enjoyment of it, and the fact that it seems to have helped her deal with the fact that I am not always available to play with her.	2003-08-20

My 22-month old daughter loves this book and wants to read it every night.  It has been extremely useful for getting her to sleep in her own bed.  For what it's worth, I find the Caillou books most useful when I edit them judiciously to reflect our own situation and her own current issues (e.g., waking at night and wanting to cuddle, rather than waking from bad dreams).  I give it five stars simply because my daughter asks for it every night, and it seems to have helped her make the transition to sleeping all night, every night, in her own bed.	2003-08-20
