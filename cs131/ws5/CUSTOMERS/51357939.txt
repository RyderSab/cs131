Two daughters, born in the late 1940's, feeling somehow they never quite fit in with their family nor their life in London. We follow them as young girls in boarding school through to motherhood. Cathy, ever compliant, the perfect student and Monty, her younger sister, ever rebellious getting into every scrape possible.<br /><br />If you enjoy stories about strong women, you'll enjoy the mystery surrounding these two as they attempt to determine what made their father commit suicide; where did the two perfect, priceless, pink pearls come from and WHY?<br /><br />There is a lot of angst and suffering of life that I couldn't possibly relate to, even though the girls were in my age bracket. That actually made the entire story more alluring as they grew into their own adult lives and untangled their fascinating family legacy.<br /><br />This old fashioned story (written in 1987)is unfortunately full of exploitation and racism; about two women starting their lives in a hut in Malaya. Cathy to become a glamorous leader of international finance, Monty a rock star adored by millions of fans, then both finally meeting the Princess Ayeshah; a fabulous beauty... who is she really?<br /><br />I look forward to more by Celia Brayfield.	2005-08-19

Find this absorbing work of non-fiction and you'll be absolutely delighted! It's chock full of information that will bring joyous memories from your childhood. The author delves into a century of nostalgia, from 1890 to 1990 including \\"Fads and Follies\\", \\"Dance Crazes\\", Radio Program History, Popular Song/Movie/History and best of all... Popular BOOK history. This does not read like an almanac. The author has a witty sense of humor and (by the content)really took a lot of time doing research.

In 1905, in this absorbing story of village life, England's Lake District villagers are (with a fair amount of tizzy gossip) eagerly anticipating the arrival of the new owner of Hill Top Farm. Charms and irritations of life, in this small country village, are cleverly written and Albert gives the reader glimpses of Beatrix Potter's biography with a mixture of truth and whimsical fiction. Ms. Potter did purchase Hill Top Farm, bringing with her two bunnies, a hedgehog and mouse. They, along with the motley village cats and one rascally dog, delightfully talk to each other!<br /><br />The cast of endearing and eccentric characters are brought together in this (the first of a series of eight) gentle mystery. Fans of  Dora Saint (\\"Miss Read\\") and Rita Mae Brown will find the anticipated series thoroughly enjoyable. I don't compare authors... I just LOVE'em!<br /><br />The next book in the series \\"The Tale of Holly How\\" is coming in July, 2005.	2005-06-03

Dare she go against the wishes of her parents to marry a high school sweetheart? She meets a dashing city fellow who may be inappropriate to her way of life, however gentle and polite he seems.<br /><br />I hope the author goes on to tell the story of Rose and her new in-laws.

Her writing can be compared to Pilcher and Binchy as noted, and what a wonderful compliment...i.e., the descriptive writing and attention to detail so that the characters have the breath of life in them. They wound themselves around the heart of this enchanted reader.<br /><br />The descriptions of Cornwall were so clear that I was transported.<br /><br />The intertwining of characters, simply living their (not so) ordinary lives, becomes anything but ordinary.  The main character, Maudie Todhunter, is delightful as is her step-granddaughter Posey. Posey's Mother, Selena was impossibly frightful and Ms.Willett weaves a wonderful tale of family strengths, weaknesses, falling in love (with a few mysteries thrown in) through them.  I particularly loved Polonius, the dog.<br /><br />I have her \\"A Summer In The Country\\" and eagerly begin another anticipated delight! Thank you Marcia Willett!	2005-01-09

If you enjoy Grafton, Evanovich, and Tamar Myers (my other favorite mystery authors who write about 'real' people) you'll enjoy Goldy's sleuthing attempts to determine 1)who keeps trying to poison her lovable (?) ex-father-in-law, 2)who murdered her son's lovely, yet peculiar prior elementary school teacher and (deep breath) 3)WHY does everyone seem to know more about the entire mystery than Goldy?

She barely remembers her mother, and clings to dim memories of her mother's love.<br />Secret Life of Bee's is a heartwarming, feel-good story set in the 1960's when racial tensions and violence were at an all time high. After a jailbreak arranged by Lily (after a violent encounter Rosaleen had with racists during an insane attempt to exercise some of her newly granted freedoms) these two embark on a road trip to Tiburon, based on a clue from Lily's Mother's past. There they meet a wonderful family of women beekeepers and enjoy an unlikely merger into the truest kind of family. Lily keeps the truth to herself regarding their arrival and in her experiences with Rosaleen, May, June, and August she seeks the truth about her mother and is able to discern that a mother is more than just a biological bond. Each of these women is a teacher and guide to Lily. You will travel with Lily as she experiences life with each of the four remarkable women even if it means looking to someone other than the woman who gave us initial life.  It is a lovely story of Mothers. I read this book based on an Amazon review by a dear friend.  Thank you so much PLFBB.	2002-07-09

This beautiful version recognizes why we have compassion and pity for poor Cinders while opening our hearts to her &quot;mean &amp; ugly&quot; stepsisters.  The (up to the present time) unseen stepsisters and their extraordinary love and conflict with their \\"changeling sister\\" is the most outstanding of the strong threads carrying the story, especially as she (Cinders/Clara) is not relegated to the status of servant by her self-serving stepmother; she chooses it for herself.<br />Kudos to illustrator Bill Sanderson. The cover and interior art is simply amazing.  Once again, a book I initially reached for due to the beautiful, intriguing cover.	2002-07-06

The friend that I borrowed this book from was devastated when I returned it and she (subsequently) couldn't find it.  Synchronously, I received it in a recycling effort from one of her dear friends.  Imagine how excited she's going to be to receive it back!<br /><br />With good-humored perspective, Ruth Reichl, NY Times Food Editor, lovingly introduces the significant people in her life and the way she managed to find a path for herself and build a wonderful life in spite of a tumultuous childhood. A childhood that was filled with emotional trauma and rather ghastly home experiences, (imagine) Ruth's Mother picks her up from middle school, and without any preparation or explanation, drives to Canada, where she deposits Ruth in a Catholic boarding school where only French is spoken. When Ruth begs not to be left there, her Mother reminds her that she is the one that wants to learn French!<br />Reichl introduces us to quirky, memorable characters that thankfully guided the development of her love of fine food. A story filled with wit, sadness, resourcefulness and occasional mishap, Ruth will tell you she learned early in life that the most important thing in life is a good story!<br />You will be as amazed as I by the life Reichl led and discover a range of cooking and eating possibilities way beyond today's lifestyle.

You'll most likely relate to Jemima's feelings and \\"I can make my own destiny\\" course of action. That is what ultimately leads her to her utterly self-satisfying conclusion.<br />Yes, it has a lot of plot-holes, but will definitely keep your interest. You can't wait to find out what happens next.<br />It is an amusing tale of a British gal who happens to use food for comfort. Even though the completely unrealistic premise of this book is full of all the fat girl/skinny girl clich&eacute;s, the author delicately explores the sadness and loneliness that incurs when a persons self esteem is not up to par for whatever reason. You don't have to have a weight problem to relate to Jemima. I've read this at a time when I'm struggling to overcome a few of my own hurdles. I found it to be inspiring in its own funny way. Not good literature, but good fun. Intelligent readers will find nothing dangerous here and just enjoy a couple of giggles and hopefully admire it as the essential element of dreams - of which good fiction is made!	2002-07-04

Talking fruit bat Roberto; a transvestite navigator; a hooker on a quest to join the mile high club.  These are but a few of the zany and outrageous characters that are part of the wildest, most outrageous novel I've read in a long time.  There are evil conspiracies, suspense, adventure, and Moore invokes a moral point of view where the bad guys come up against a really loose cannon, Tucker Case, pilot of a PINK jet; well, I hesitate to mention more, as I feel the surprise plots are what make this book the bizarre and outlandish jewel of a satirical, rollicking romp through a remote region of the South Pacific.

It's been awhile since I've read DS and I was quickly captured by the usual style of her writing. The local is near my home so I am very familiar with the SF and Napa areas. It's written in late 1890's through the 1900's; one of my favorite eras.<br />This story of a wonderful man, Jerimiah Thurston, loosing his first love and burying himself in his work WAS typical. At the same time, the story goes beyond the typical when he finds himself in love (inappropriately, he feels at first) with a young Southern girl; young enough to be his daughter. This is not considered unusual in this time period, so I was happy for him, yet wondering where it would all lead.<br />Where it leads is THE story.  She, Camille, turns out to be his worst nightmare and the worst nightmare of her own daughter.  I was shocked and dismayed at her behavior, however that is one reason the story was so compelling.  I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. What Camille does towards the end of the story was truly &quot;ballsy&quot; (for lack of a better adj).<br />True to form, DS weaves a tale of unreal, bewildering characters and plots. The descriptive quality of the San Francisco and Napa areas will make you want to visit Thurston House.<br />You won't believe the end!  Only four stars as I felt the end was a little rushed; however you get the point!	2001-10-27

This being my first Jance novel, I was a little skeptical especially after reading the reviews first.

How could a mother leave her two young children for the love of a man? I was surprised at the beginning and a little dismayed that my beloved Maeve Binchy would consider such a topic.  As usual, she weaves a tale that you CAN believe.<br /><br />Helen leaves and is presumed dead due to an unfortunate turn of events brought about by her (well meaning) young daughter Kit.  Helen is living with the pain of separation of her children; Kit is living with the guilt of what she has done.<br /><br />Through the years, the secrets unfold and both mother and daughter have to learn to cope with the results.<br /><br />This story burns in my heart.	2001-10-27

However, I had it figured out too soon~ The characters from past novels were a mystery to me, so my grasp of their importance was nil. I really liked the new characters introduced and found the antics of the &quot;injured&quot; novelist amusing as she tried to function from her hospital bed.  Include the Christmas season and a kidnapping by amateurs and you've got a story with mild intrigue and danger.  Enjoyable yet predictable ending.	2001-10-22

This is a TRUE story about the unrequited love of a young man (Ian) and woman (Lorna) from feuding families. It is truly the epitome of the Scottish history that emphasizes the generations of Scots, and how their fueding was a typical way of life. The fueds were brought on by often real or sometimes imagined slights.  The constant need to merely &quot;stay alive/exist&quot; led to cattle raids and sometimes the loss of an entire clan, depending on the slight!  The MacTavish clan haunted generations with a curse for future clans: &quot;Hatred our sword and feud our fire&quot;.  During the Boer War in 1902, the clans put aside their tensions. Lorna MacNeil was engaged to Malcolm MacDuff, yet in love with Ian MacTavish.  This story takes you to the battlefield in France and back to Scotland, using the &quot;Glen of Spirits&quot; to provide an eery feeling to the voice of this wonderful story. There are a number of startling moments, that made me exclaim out loud.  A genuine look at Scottish History.	2001-07-19

A young lady with lovely manners finds help for her broken down car in the most unexpected place.

His review is perfect. I only wish I had read it before starting this story.  The characters are incredibly interesting and the social interactions and their faith in each other made me think and appreciate my own.

However, this book told a story of a man's perception of right and wrong.  Jack's internal conflicts and his thoughts do get a little wordy, and he does have a problem relating to females. But the morality involved here is quite interesting.  To say this couldn't happen in the small town you live in?  Probably already has.  It's an unfortunate slice of reality; nothing joyful, warm and fuzzy about this story, but it does create a thought process.  I can't stop thinking about the ending...  You won't believe it...
