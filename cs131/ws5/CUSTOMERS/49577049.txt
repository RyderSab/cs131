Being a mom who breastfed her child until one month after her third birthday, I can totally relate to this story of extended nursing. I can remember that special time like it was yesterday...my daughter's sweet face smiling back up at me as she was nursing, her hands gently tugging at my hair, her eyes slowly drifting into a deep sleep. What a wonderful experience it was for the both of us.<br />The book, &quot;I'm Made of Mama's Milk,&quot; by Mary Olsen, is a short rhyming story that captures the nursing experiences of a toddler and her family. Not only is this book special for nursing mothers and their children, but it's also a good book for non-nursing mothers to share with their children. Most of the time non-nursing children will have the opportunity to see children who are nursing, and this book will help to clear up any questions they may have.  I think it's simple enough for even very young children to understand.<br />MyParenTime.com highly recommends this book -- it's perfect for babies and toddlers, whether they're nursing or not! The book is made of sturdy cardboard pages, and shows softened images of a toddler and her family. Many of these images show the toddler nursing and smiling. Other images show the toddler enjoying her family :). On the last page of the book, there is a reflective foil where the child reading the book can look inside and see themselves. Babies and toddlers just love looking at themselves! What a sweet book to accompany what is bound to be a very sweet time in your child's life :).	2002-07-20

Many times they know other women who have either been through a pregnancy, or who are pregnant at the same time as they are. Who do the soon-to-be husbands turn to? Other men or women? I tend to think not. Let's face it...it's easier for women to discuss their pregnancies than it is for their husbands.  Actually, it's easier for women to discuss lots of things :-).  So if men don't turn to anyone else, where can they turn to to find the answers to their many questions about their wife's pregnancy? One good source is the book, &quot;Congratulations, You're Gonna Be a Dad,&quot; by Paul &amp; Pam Pettit.<br />As a mother, I was able to relate to many of the situations in the book. Men, on the other hand, will certainly gain a lot of knowledge, and read what it's like to be a dad from the many stories written by fathers. Soon-to-be dads will learn what it means when someone tells their wife that they are &quot;glowing;&quot; what a &quot;growth spurt&quot; is; and many more useful facts about pregnancy and fatherhood. And women...men will also get some tips on how to prevent and treat diaper rash -- now there's no excuse!  I think soon-to-be fathers will gain a little more respect for women, pregnancy, and the whole process of reproduction after they've read this book :-).<br />My ParenTime recommends &quot;Congratulations Youre Gonna Be a Dad&quot; - It's informative, enlightening, a joy to read, and will help men prepare a little more mentally, for an event that will soon change the rest of their lives.	2002-04-12

They may not share their problems with their parents, and so begin to look for solutions on their own. This is where the help of a tell-all book comes in :).<br />The book, &quot;Raising Yourself: Making the Right Choices,&quot; by Sumant Pendharkar, is a self-help book for children over age 10, that touches on subjects such as being a teenager; self-doubts; the teen phase; the cost of living on their own; pregnancy; and other topics that children have questions about.  Of course the best scenario would be for a child to speak to their parents whenever they have a question, but we all know how hard it is to approach parents about certain topics :).<br />My ParenTime recommends &quot;Raising Yourself: Making the Right Choices&quot; - it's an upfront look at what the future has to offer our children. It's direct enough to be used as a &quot;guide&quot; so children can become familiar with some of the decisions they will be faced with, and what the consequences will be.	2002-03-07

What would it be like if the world had no color? Ruben knows, because he used to live without color. Who's Ruben, you ask? He's the young boy in the book, \\"Ruben's Rainbow,\\" who lived in a black-and-white world. After being \\"plopped\\" into a new and colorful world, Ruben found a way to bring all the colors of the rainbow back home with him.<br />This book is special -- it is written in English and Spanish. The sentences are short and easily translated, so parents and children can read in both languages. Accompanying the book is an Audio CD, that recites the story out loud, first in English alone, then in Spanish alone, and then in both English and Spanish. For the dual version, I wish that one sentence at a time was translated instead of the whole page. Also, I would have preferred some silence after the translation, so the parent or child could repeat the words themselves before the next sentence began. Despite my own preferences, the Audio CD is a wonderful complement to the book, since it allows parents and children to actually hear how the words should be pronounced in both languages.<br />MyParenTime.com recommends \\"Ruben's Rainbow,\\" by Carlos Harrison and Grizelle Paz - the story is sweet; the illustrations are colorful and simple; and it introduces another language to children.

If we can learn and understand exactly what a child's basic needs are, there may be a chance to save these children.<br />The book &quot;The Irreducible Needs of Children&quot;, accomplishes the goal of describing the seven basic needs of a child - what they need in order to grow and thrive.  Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, and Dr. Stanley Greenspan have both brought forth challenging information, including discussing methods to change society and people's actions &amp; responses in order to suit a child's needs.<br />There may be situations where parents and caregivers may not be able to provide certain necessities to their children (ie: single parents &amp; full-time parenting).  After reading this book, these parents (who may be doing all they can for their children), may not agree with the recommendations or they may even feel inadequate as a provider.  For these situations, the authors give suggestions on how to best find a suitable substitute, so the child will still receive the care he or she needs.  There are also the other needs that must be met - we should all try as best as we can to meet each one.<br />My ParenTime recommends &quot;The Irreducible Needs of Children&quot;, especially to those who have the ability to make changes in laws affecting children.  Our children are our future - don't they at least deserve the basic necessities?	2000-12-04
