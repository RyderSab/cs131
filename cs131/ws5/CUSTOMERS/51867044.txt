It has become my personal scrapbooking bible. It is just filled to the brim with layout ideas, techniques, embellishment examples and more. Best of all, everything is so easy (and quick) you'll have your pages done in no time.  <br /> <br />What I've learned to do is scrapbook in steps. I decide what I'm going to scrap (say, a trip to San Diego), how many pages (one or two - or more) and which photos I'm going to use. Then I consult my Quick & Easy book and decide which layout(s) to try with it. From there I just choose my paper and go from there! I have not been anything less than thrilled with how they come out when using this book's formulas.	2004-08-07

I truly enjoyed this book - like another reviewer here it was on my wish list for ages. I finally succumbed and am so glad I did! Sure, there are a few flaws (like why didn't Sissy have any friends at all?) and a few minor incidents left unexplained - but the story was good enough for me to forgive these oversights. Sissy is a likeable character with the same type of spunk you'd expect from a Sweet Potato Queen.	2003-11-21

I have a hard time believing not only that the US would offer &quot;1000 white women&quot; but even that the Native Americans would treat them as part of their tribes and allow them to act in ways unheard of by their culture. There are twin Natives to match twin &quot;white women&quot; and a black native to match a black bride... this just seems too coincidental.<br />That said, the actual story is quite interesting and of course a novel concept. May Dodd is a thoughtful character, though I think most of the time Fergus has her reporting &quot;happenings&quot; in her journals, rather than revealing deep and developed characters. <br />It is certainly not a novel to get engrossed in, however it is quite good and I would recommend it for light reading.	2003-03-20

Started it on a cross-country flight and finished it in my hotel room that evening. The story is fairly well done, however like one of the previous reviewers I agree that Spencer's character should have seen through the &quot;switch&quot; plot and not been so surprised by it. The story was very predictable but perfect &quot;fluff&quot; for reading while traveling.	2002-11-13
US	51867044	RTALKYY7NGCM7	0060989025	806784353	The Water and the Blood: A Novel	Books	5	35	36	N	N	An excellent work by Turner	Once you get past the mixed POV (the main character's story is told in the first person, and other characters are brought in by the omnipotent point of view), this book is a very enjoyable read.<br />The story is of Philadelphia (Frosty) Summers, going from childhood to young adulthood during the time of World War II. She struggles to break from her family's stronghold and the ties that bind her to Sabine, Texas, her small, prejudice-laden hometown. Through her experiences, she learns independence and compassion - something she can only do by cutting the apron strings that bind her to Sabine.<br />This is a much different story than my all-time favorite &quot;These Is My Words&quot; but only slightly less compelling. I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. I have become a huge fan of Nancy E. Turner and can't wait to read whatever she comes up with next!	2002-10-21

Most of them are generic enough that they can be commented on, providing insight to whomever ends up reading the final version. This is not a book which can be completed quickly - many of the questions relate to &quot;middle age&quot; with grandkids, etc. (things I have yet to experience). However I believe once it is done (even in partial form) it will be something nice I can leave behind for my children and maybe grandchildren to read and gain insight into my life.	2002-10-21

The story was long and drawn out, however it kept my interest well enough that I didn't mind. It would make great summer/beach reading.<br />The very best part about reading this work was the character development. Siddons does a brilliant job in creating and describing several different and distinct characters. They weave in and out of each others lives in believable and interesting ways.<br />As I mentioned, this was my first reading of Siddons' but it will not be my last.	2002-10-17
US	51867044	R2TDW1T2FFXSAC	0312147015	253392869	The Persian Pickle Club	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A "light" mystery explores female relationships	Set in 1930s Kansas, Dallas writes of Queenie's friendship with newcomer and newlywed Rita. Rita, a \\"big city girl\\", is unsuited for the country life in Harveyville, Kansas but Queenie's polite and forgiving nature welcomes her into the \\"Persian Pickle Club\\" society (a quilting bee). Rita wishes to land a job as a reporter at a Topeka newspaper, and decides the way to do it is to solve the murder of Ben Crook. She enlists Queenie to help her, and encounters many obstacles along the way.<br />Although the mystery itself is a big part of the story, the book is more about the relationships between the women of the club. Dallas does a wonderful job in creating and describing lively and realistic characters, each of whom show remarkable depth.<br />I found this book to be very, very good, although I did enjoy \\"The Diary of Mattie Spenser\\" a bit more, hence the four stars (I sure wish Amazon allowed 4-1/2 stars!).	2002-09-24

Although she dearly missed her parents, she was treated like a princess and as if she was the king's own daughter. It was very interesting to see how the Moroccan royalty lived. <br />Later in the book, she was placed under house arrest with her family in a series of guarded homes. However it seemed that she was still living a better life than many of the country's poor (all the food and water they wanted, plus all their belongings - designer clothing, jewelry, etc. - were still in their possession). It is not until later in the book that the Oufkir family is transferred to a deplorable prison which seemed to me like a concentration camp. There, they spent many years and became like so many other political prisoners &quot;the forgotten.&quot; <br />Ms. Oufkir has an uncanny ability to remember the most minute details of her life and does an excellent job of relating the relationships between herself and her family members as well as describing her thoughts and feelings throughout their imprisonment. Like some other reviewers, I too believe the writing was a bit weak at times (the only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5), but perhaps that is because the story was translated into English.<br />I do recommend this book - it is a 'heavy' read though and can be quite stressful at times.	2002-09-17

Reason being the many references to and clarifications of Browne's first book, \\"The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love.\\" This second book, however, is a wonderful continuation of the SPQs' epics and antics.<br />Given the handbook-like advice of Jill Connor Browne and her cohorts the \\"Tammys\\", any red-blooded American woman will feel self-empowered and independent. Browne's writing style is comedic and highly entertaining, and causes the reader to laugh out loud... often. Beware, husbands watching sports nearby may feel threatened by her truths! I should mention that this is humor only a woman will understand and appreciate.<br />Now I am anxiously awaiting book #3!	2002-09-06

Her mother Ingrid is serving a life sentence for murder but still somehow finds a way to get under her skin through poems and letters. Astrid spends her teenage years enduring heartbreak after heartbreak as the fatherless child left behind by her mother's crime.<br />The two things I liked most about this book were (1) the true-to-life character of Astrid, who found countless faults in her mother but still loved her as a child will strive to do; and (2) the poetic writing style of the author, which made the book an extremely enjoyable read.	2002-09-03

Book two of the Russians series has action, romance, friendship and best of all, an interesting storyline.<br />This series is typically categorized by bookstores as &quot;religious fiction&quot;.

I finally finished the series earlier this year and consider it to be a major accomplishment (and a very fulfilling one).

Wish I could have made it 4-1/2 stars. Unlike Little Altars which tells the story from several characters' points of view, Divine Secrets is told only from the POV of Sidda and Vivi. Its story is very close to the screenplay, although a few things were changed, most notably Sidda's location when she is exploring &quot;the book.&quot; All in all, very enjoyable and worthy of a few laughs, and a few tears.	2002-08-22

It has been on my wish list for about a year now and I didn't even know it was related to the Ya-Ya Sisterhood until last week!<br />Anyway like I said I got it on Friday afternoon and finished it by dinnertime on Saturday - it was THAT GOOD.<br />Each chapter was told in a different characters' point of view. There were several by Sidda and a few from Vivi, but there was also some insight from Big Shep, Willetta, and Sidda's siblings Little Shep, Baylor and Lulu. This format provided better insight into the family's troubles than just Sidda's POV would have.<br />The story overall is disturbing and sad - especially the chapters with Willetta and Little Shep. Plenty of happy memories are visited throughout the book but they are overshadowed by a dark cloud in every chapter, usually the result of something Vivi has done.<br />Reading this book helped me to better understand its subsequent &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; and I would highly recommend it with FIVE STARS!	2002-07-08

The book's very weak plot is about Lila Mae and her relationship with her four children. The first 2/3 of the book is a long, drawn out story of their trip across country to meet up with Lila Mae's husband &amp; the kids' father in California. She literally drags the children along on a wild goose chase all over the country with no apparent desire to get to their destination. A trip which took her husband three days takes Lila Mae over a month. The second 1/3 of the book is one long chapter about Lila Mae in her old age, skipping around at some of her memories throughout her life, none of which are particularly engaging. I only stuck with this book because I didn't want to leave it unfinished, but had I done so I would not have missed much.	2002-07-05

Alice tells of her trials and triumphs through letters to her sister Lizzie back home. Some parts of the story are only hinted at, but some are described in great detail. Alice struggles through loneliness, poverty, weather hardships, and even being treated as an outcast by her peers. The best part of Alice's story is how she relates to other characters in the book, who also become endearing to the reader.<br />Lizzie's life is also revealed to us as a secondary story by way of Alice's comments and advice in reply to her letters (which are unseen by the reader). I very much enjoyed Dallas' way of weaving quilting metaphors into the story. It's caused me to want to pick up the hobby again!<br />If you enjoy this book, you may want to read another of Dallas' books &quot;The Diary of Mattie Spenser&quot;, as well as &quot;These Is My Words&quot; by Nancy Turner.	2002-05-21

The photos are clear and great examples of what the plants will look like. Plants are listed alphabetically by scientific name, but there's a handy cross-reference in the back to make it easier. The most helpful tool is under each plant's description where it clearly lists possible problems and maintenance needed. One thing I wish it did include are citrus trees, but I suppose they were left out because they are not native plants (but then again, I didn't think palms were either, and they are listed).	2002-05-03

The fourth book centers around Anna's adoptive daughter and niece Mariana, so there is plenty of &quot;new&quot; to this story. However, there is a lot of dwelling on past events, so I beleive someone who hasn't read the first three of the series may be able to follow it - and perhaps find it even more interesting for that reason. I, too, enjoy Pella's writing style, and how she incorporates Anna's strong Christian faith into the story without it seeming intrusive.	2002-02-18

I won't waste space with a summary of the story, as several reviewers have already listed it. However, this quickly became one of my favorite books (the other being very similar &quot;These Is My Words&quot; by Nancy Turner). The hardships Mattie and her family faced seemed realistic to me, although I would have like to get more detail on how they built the soddy house, how she prepared a meal, etc. However, since it is in diary format, one would assume that these details would naturally be left out by the fictional author. I hope to find more books similar to these. They are a great way to get lost in another point of history.	2002-02-11

The chronicles of Sarah Prine's trecherous trek to the Arizona Territories is no less than spectactular.

This is one of the rare novels I would rate a 5 -- higher if that were possible!  UPDATE: More than a dozen years have passed since I first read this novel, and I have re-read it a few times, something that I never do! If you love historical fiction, especially stories set in the developing Western US, I highly recommend this book. Turner's other novels are also very good, but this one just has me captivated.	2001-06-04

I have a hard time believing that the descriptive language used could have come from a child Lark's age. If you don't mind a slow-moving story, I would recommend it.
