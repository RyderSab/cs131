US	52693410	R1MS5FU7PEXRIN	0586024395	397951803	Voyage of Space Beagle	Books	3	8	10	N	N	An okay book	This 1930s novel was supposed to be inspiration for 1957's film, IT! THE TERROR FROM OUT OF SPACE, which film inspired 1979's ALIEN film.<br /><br />The novel takes place in the far future.  The Space Beagle is the first spaceship to travel to another galaxy.  That's a pretty bold concept, if you understand astronomy.  It's mind-boggling enough to think we'll ever span even our own galaxy, but the Space Beagle is traveling to another galaxy.<br /><br />The story takes place in that vast void between galaxies.  The usual space opera/soap opera power plays aboard a spaceship on a voyage to discover new worlds.  However, despite the distant future, people are pretty much like they were in the 1930s (kinda like how on STAR TREK they resemble 1960s people).<br /><br />Anyway, while they're traveling in that void between galaxies, they come upon a dragon-like monster floating in space.  The monster is immortal, and cannot be destoyed.  Doesn't need food or air.  The author also describes what the monster is thinking.  He was once a feared ruler of a galaxy, but is now exiled into space.  He's indestructible, but he has a problem.  Since he's got nothing to grab or propel himself again, he's doomed to float in the void unless something comes along, an astroid or whatever, that can take him back into a galaxy.  Along comes the Space Beagle...<br /><br />So the crew sees the monster floating, they come up close, the monster grabs the spaceship and enters.  (He can also float through matter, should he so desire, so at times he floats through the spaceship floors as a means of hiding from the crew), and the killing starts.  The monster has contempt for these inferior humans.  The humans must now trick the monster into leaving the ship.<br /><br />This monster tale only occupies about a third of the book.  There are other adventures for the Space Beagle.<br /><br />The hero is a scientist who's invented a new dicipline: nexilism.  It's the science of combining sciences (i.e., to find their nexus).  In another story, he discovers a mind creature that has taken over an entire galaxy and killed all life in it.<br /><br />This is an okay book, interesting from a historical perspective, if you care about the inspiration of IT!, which inspired ALIEN!  It's not a great book, IMO, but reasonably entertaining.ences (i.e., to find their nexus).

She's disingenuous, dishing dirt on celebs, then claiming she admires them. And she pulls punches. She worked for the Enquirer from 1975-95, yet concentrates on 1970s celebs now safely dead: Frank Sinatra, Richard Burton, Tammy Wynette. Blurbs from B-list celebs and players further indicate that she pulls punches.<br /><br /> But she does provide useful info on tabloid undercover reporting techniques. And it's a breezy, entertaining, easy read, as one would expect from someone with longtime tabloid writing experience.<br /><br /> However, the best and most comprehensive tabloid HISTORY remains I WATCHED A WILD HOG EAT MY BABY, by Bill Sloan, which was released in 2001.<br /><br />Also, reviewers are wrong when they say that Sternig's is the first inside report from a former tabloid reporter.  In 1996, a darker inside look from two former tabloid reporters was provided in POISON PEN, by Lysa Moskowitz-Mateu & David LaFontaine.	2004-07-30

Another was a devout Catholic who sided with Franco to oppose the Reds.  Meanwhile, this CIA officer hero must also struggle with the challenge of maintaining a happy marriage.

The book's title refers to a secret sixth directorate, which may be plotting a coup against the Soviet government.  Most of the action occurs in Britain and New York, some of it in the USSR.<br />This novel has an enjoyable and convoluted plot, if you like spy novels.  It's not a James Bond plot, but more of a morose, low-key story, with betrayals and divorce, the sort of story John Le Carre writes.  It's not an exceptional book, but still a good spy thriller if you like the genre.<br />I especially enjoyed the brief passages featuring Andropov.  Andropov was the true-life head of the KGB, who became the Soviet dictator for about a year after Brezhnev died.  Andropov was also said to be Gorbachev's mentor.  THE SIXTH DIRECTORATE doesn't touch on any of that.  Andropov only appears because he was KGB boss at the time.	2003-08-18

Most of this book is the 1989 revolution that overthrew the Ceausescu's, and the still controversial &quot;miner's revolts&quot; in the ensuing months, especially in June 1990.<br />The authors have done an excellent job interviewing all key players, high and low.  Their access is remarkable: Iliescu, the first post-Ceausescu Romanian leader, as well as leaders of the revolution, the National Salvation Front, the opposing party leaders (Peasant's Party, Ecology Party, etc.), and miner's leaders (such as Miron Cozma -- who went on to serve 18 months in prison well after this book was published).<br />The authors have also interviewed all sorts of common folk: miners, students, demonstrators who were at the revolution in Bucharest and Timisoara, including Father Tokes.<br />There are even interviews from sideline players, which add much color to events.  They interviewed professors of Marxism in the Communist Party Academy who, watching the revolution on TV, realized they'd soon be out of work.  And a chapter on Ceausescu's massive public works project, the controversial Boulevard Of The Victory of Socialism, the authors interviewed people whose houses had been torn down, many of whom now live in the new apartments lining the Boulevard.  The authors asked them how they like living on the Boulevard.  (As has been reported elsewhere, many Romanians are proud of the Boulevard and House Of The Republic, despite the social and architectural costs, which they admit was not necessarily worth it.)<br />Although much of the pre-revolution info is reported elsewhere, this book offers new material there as well.  For instance, this book includes contemporary (from 1990) photos of the three Ceausescu children -- Zoia, Valentin, and the controversial Nicu.  The authors also interviewed all three children -- Nicu from his prison.  Since Nicu died in 1996, there will be no new interviews forthcoming.<br />The authors traveled to the Jiu Valley to interview miner leader Miron Cozma, as well as opposition leaders.  They even visited the mines.<br />A down side: in relating the events of the revolution, the authors drop many names of government officials, saying who was where, when, and what they say happened.  But we're often told little of these people's backgrounds, career histories, politics, or why they were important. For instance, the book leaves unclear why so many people rallied to Iliescu so early.  There are so many people discussed, perhaps the authors didn't want to add 100 or so extra pages with brief bios on everyone.  But this lack of context makes it hard to judge or understand events.<br />This is not a history book, but a work of journalism.  (The authors cite the old phrase: Journalism is history's first draft).  But there's so much original research in this book, it should remain in print, and in hardback.  Historians would find this a useful book.  However, I don't think this 1991 British paperback has ever been released in the US, or anywhere in hardback.<br />Being a work of journalism, the prose is easy to read.  It's exciting and informative (as opposed to many academic texts, which are turgid).  Both authors are seasoned journalists.  Galloway has written for The Guardian, Sunday Times, Evening Standard, Glasgow Herald, the Scotsman -- and he's an MP (member of Parliament).  Labour Party, I'd assume.  Bob Wyle is also a journalist and teacher; the book describes him as &quot;formerly a prominent Marxist.&quot;<br />Although the authors are both men of the Left, they are not sympathetic to communism (and ironically, they seem to favor the Times' coverage of events to that of The Independent).  The book gets all sides, but also admits to having an opinion.  Regarding the post-revolution controversies, the authors are sympathetic to Iliescu and the miners.  They do not believe accusations that the Iliescu regime was likely a front for Communists and Securitate members; and while they agree that the miners used excessive force, they are also sympathetic to the miners' plight, and agree with those who claim the June demonstrators (crushed by the miners) appeared on the verge of overthrowing Romania's first democratically elected government.<br />Much has happened since this book was published (the downfall of Iliescu and the imprisonment of Cozma), and events continue to unfold.  It's interesting to read where the authors' speculations have proven correct and false.  For instance, in 1991 they speculated that Eastern Europe may \\"return to the policies of the 1930s.  Then the region was plagued with xenophobia, nationalism, territorial disputes, ethnic rivalries and Bonapartist dictators&quot;.  This was true for Yugoslavia.  But they were wrong when they suggested that &quot;it is not fanciful to see [Romania] re-emerge as the most powerful and influential in southern Europe in the next decade.&quot;<br />This work of journalism is indeed a first draft of history, and there's much original info here for any historian, amateur or professional, who wishes a snapshot of Romanian politics and society from December 1989-June 1990.gime was likely a front for Communists and Securitate members; and while they agree that the miners used excessive force, they are also sympathetic to the miners' plight, and agree with those who claim the June demonstrators (crushed by the miners) appeared on the verge of overthrowing Romania's first democratically elected government.  <br />Much has happened since this book was published (the downfall of Iliescu and the imprisonment of Cozma), and events continue to unfold.

Instead, it's part morbid biography, part political tract.<br />There are two stories, told in alternating chapters.  One is a fictionalization of true-life Elizabeth Barthoy's depravities (no supernatural vampire stuff, just torture).  The other story is set in the present, as Barthoy's Hungarian decendent returns to Hungary to come to terms with his past.<br />Codrescu has a dense, turgid writing style that makes for slow reading.  And it's boring.  Hard to imagine Barthoy's life could be rendered dull, but Codrescu manages it, despite his discomforting torture scenes.  Too much \\"inner life\\" as his characters think about this or that, philosophizing and such, and not enough dialogue.  And when there is dialgue, it's not crisp or pithy.<br />Furthermore, Codrescu strikes me as dishonest and bigoted toward Hungarians.<br />Dishonest, because the dust jacket claims that he's Hungarian, yet Codrescu is a Romanian name.  In fact, his book about Romania (The Hole In The Flag) claims that Codrescu is Romanian.  So which is he -- Hungarian or Romanian?  Maybe it's just a case of publishers trying to slant Codrescu's bio to fit his book, but it's not an idle question, because Hungarians and Romanians have long suffered ethnic tensions and hostility toward each other.<br />Reading the Blood Countess, I get the sense that Codrescu is a Romanian who doesn't much like Hungarians.  His present day Hungarian character does much ruminating about the national crimes and sins of the Hungarian people.  In fact, his Hungarian character sounds like a Romanian who dislikes Hungarians.<br />I'm not saying which ethnic group has more to complain about.  But I think readers should be aware of the animosity between these two groups, so they can take the Blood Countess's Hungarian-bashing with a grain of salt.<br />Codrescu has also written a book on bigotry (The Devil Never Sleeps).  But instead of preaching tolerance to others, he should do a reality check on his own animosity toward Hungarians.to others, he should do a reality check on his own animosity toward Hungarians.	2003-06-26

I read this book over 20 years ago.  It taught me \\"how to watch TV.\\"  Critics have compared it to the film book classic, FROM CALIGARI TO HITLER (an analysis of how Weimer Germany films reflected German sociological undercurrents).<br />Ben Stein watched popular TV shows from the 1970s, both sitcoms and dramas, then analyed how various social groups are protrayed: businessmen (as criminals), the military (psychotic sadists), minorities (good-hearted), criminals (driven to do bad by racism and poverty) clergy (nice but ineffectual), govt social workers (noble, idealistic, hard-working).<br />Watch any episode of a 1970s show (Beretta, Kojak, Good Times, Rockford Files, The Jeffersons), and you'll be amazed at how consistent the formula is.<br />Ben Stein also interviewed many TV writers and producers, and demonstrated how their own backgrounds and lifestyles gave rise to the liberal biases reflected in their shows.  (They really believed the world was as they portrayed it).  Maybe half were Jews, the rest mainly Catholic, who were raised in working class environments and felt the sting of prejudice from \\"country club WASP Republicans.\\"<br />Today, TV is not so liberal as in the 1970s.  TV writer Rob Long wrote in National Review a few years back that 1990s sitcoms are apolitical, because a newer generation of TV writers has replaced the old.  Most modern TV writers come from wealthy Hollywood families, or from the Ivy League (as was Long), so they no longer have the same liberal biases.<br />Even so, Ben Stein's book is STILL AS RELEVENT today as ever.  Not because of what he discoverd about 1970s TV, but because of his method of analysis.  Stein's book TAUGHT ME HOW TO WATCH TV.  It's simply the best TV analysis book out there, great reading for anyone who wants to be a TV critic, or just to see TV more clearly.<br />Plenty of film theory books, but this is one of the few really great TV theory books.

As Sloan comments, the 1990s have seen the &quot;tabloidization&quot; of mainstream media.

The 1960s were a Golden Age for tabloids. Over forty were published at one time, some very marginal and lasting only a few issues. This oversized book is mainly an anthology of lurid black &amp; white frontpage covers, one per page. The text is scant but interesting. Generously illustrated (naturally), and lots of fun! Released in 1996. 128 pages.	2001-08-27

Tabloids' &quot;fat obsession&quot; reinforce oppressive sexist standards of beauty. And &quot;Fall of the Mighty&quot; stories alleviate class antagonisms by assuring working class readers that the rich and powerful are always punished for their greed and wrongdoing. Hogshire also speculates about the tabloids' CIA and Mafia ties in the 1960s. A short (147 pages), lively, and informative book despite its biases, by a former tabloid writer (who bites the hand that fed him).	2001-08-27

Bankruptcy, sued by her former lover, career going nowhere.<br />She then tells us how she recovered through discovering a &quot;spiritual path.&quot;  Talked to shamans and such.  Began eating health food from Trader Joe's.  She includes recommended food at the back of the book, including brand names.<br />She drops lots of celebrity names to let us know how &quot;connected&quot; she is to Hollywood.  She dishes no dirt on anyone.  Nothing juicy in this book.  This is no &quot;tell all,&quot; but rather her calling card to get back in the business.<br />I was a fan of That's Incredible, so I bought the book.  Reading it, I ended liking her more, and respecting her less.  She seems a nice person, but real flakey.  Typical Hollywood personality.<br />If you enjoyed That's Incredible, and wonder whatever became of its star, you may enjoy this book.	2001-07-09

Films listed in this guide are mainly post-BLOOD FEAST (the early 1960s film that introduced &quot;splatter&quot; to horror).<br />Many films in this book are marginal and obscure, the kind not found Maltin's film guides.  The reviews are written in an off-the-cuff manner, and I don't agree with them all.  But if you've an interest in obscure gory horror films, this book is a valuable reference tool.<br />Deep Red is probably the third most complete &quot;post-BLOOD FEAST&quot; horror film guide, after John Stanley's Creature Feature Guides and the Overlook Encyclopedia (both of whisl cover all of horror).  And occassionaly, you may even find a film in Deep Red the other two don't know of.<br />It's a shame it's not been updated, or re-released.	2001-07-09

The most famous example of this genre/style is the film, BLADE RUNNER, based on Philip K. Dick's DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?  L. Neil Smith's libertarian sci-fi noir, THE WARDOVE, would be another example.<br />What all have in common is a traditional hard-boiled noir detective in a futurist setting.<br />Yet in other respects, FERRIMAN'S LAW differs.  BLADE RUNNER was dark; FERRIMAN'S LAW not nearly so.  Dick's books feature his unique metaphysical/spiritual sensibility, unlike FERRIMAN'S LAW.  THE WARDOVE is heavy on political philosophy, again, unlike FERRMAN'S LAW.<br />Instead of darkness, metaphysics, or politics, Zion's sci-fi gumshoe book packs a sharp satirical bite.  The dialogue is lean, moves fast, and is very funny.  Fans of sci-fi noir should enjoy Zion's fresh slant on this old genre/style.	2001-06-20

Aside from that one essay, the others are duds.<br />O'Rourke has a sophomoric humor, trying to shock us with how &quot;bad&quot; he is.  He regales us with drugs &amp; booze jokes, like a standup leftover from the early 1960s Brat Pack era.  He tries too hard to be funny.  His &quot;jokes&quot; are old and obvious.<br />And there's much phony posturing, for he pulls his punches lest he TRULY offend his PC employers at Rolling Stone.<br />He opposes &quot;Democratic big government&quot; because, he says, he likes to speed while driving drunk and fondling big-breasted women.  Not the sort of &quot;scathing&quot; commentary that would offend Democrats.	2001-03-19

It's not a novel, not even a novel &quot;written in the form of a screenplay.&quot;<br />It IS a screenplay.  An unproduced screenplay.<br />A screenplay with no story, no real characters.  There's this white girl, Bubbles, about whom we learn nothing.  The entire script is her stream-of-consiousess, a succession of surreal racial stereotypes.<br />Negrophobia may have worked as a short story or short film, but its gets boring after 10 pages.  The author makes one point: there are many ugly racial steroetypes out there.  Okay, we get it after 10 pages.  We get it after 40.  But silll...nothing happens.  No story develops.  Just more stream of consciousness till the end.	2000-09-24
US	52693410	R3L4NDX99N4MDD	0945774222	465213668	The Virtual Boss	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Old sci-fi theme applied to cubicle culture.	Although Kemske calls his novel a &quot;corporate nightmare,&quot; it's  also a sci-fi novel.  Literary critics often consider old genre ideas as  fresh, new, and original when they first appear in a non-genre  &quot;literary novel.&quot;  So it is in this case.<br />THE VIRTUAL BOSS's  theme was old in sci-fi circles by the 1950s.  A computer runs an office,  and takes over with a mind of its own.  THE VIRTUAL BOSS will remind many  of the HAL 9000 in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, or COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN  PROJECT.<br />Kemske's computer is less interested in exploring space than in  efficient office management.  The result is an enjoyable book on modern  cubicle culture.<br />Not a great prophetic book.  Written in the early  1990s, Kemske predicted a future of high unemployment and 12-hour workdays.  He failed to foresee the economic boom of the late 1990s, or the  empowerment the internet brought to individuals.  But there's still some  good social commentary in this book.<br />A good book for those who enjoy  reading about office politics and management and cublicle culture.	2000-08-27
US	52693410	R6ZFOMYAWLGNY	1584450274	173967190	The Wardove	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Not a bad book.	The Wardove is a fast read, and fairly enjoyable.  Written in 1986, it's obviously influenced by BLADE RUNNER.<br />Story concerns a cynical, hard-boiled noir detective circa A.D. 3000.  Set on a Libertarian lunar society, where most people view statists as weird and evil.<br />Luna is at  war with &quot;Powerists&quot; and, being a libertarian society, must raise  funds for the war voluntarily.  The &quot;wardove&quot; is a pop singer  who's touring with her band to raise money for the war effort.  Evil  statists are murdering the members of her band, and the detective must find  the killer.<br />The libertarian solutions and society are intriguing.<br />On  the down side, the aliens are silly, as loopy and unrealistic as those in  most British sci-fi TV series (e.g. Dr. Who or the Hitchhiker's Guide to  the Galaxy).  Ogats resemble floating umbrellas, and Ewons are like giant  blue starfish.  Amazingly, both survive in human environments, working side  by side with humans.  And these aliens -- they're libertarians too!<br />Even  worse, this Pulpless... edition is FULL of typos.  Broken paragraphs,  reversed quotation marks, quotation marks and commas where there should be  none, misspellings, missing periods and commas.<br />The wardove's  &quot;lyrics,&quot; strewn throughout the book, are dull and slow things  down.<br />They story is enjoyable, yet uneven, veering from drearily  hackneyed to strikingly original.<br />The identity and death of the villain  is laughably unoriginal and ineptly handled.  Yet the &quot;wardove,&quot;  her personality and effect on people, why she is as she is, and her final  scene with the detective, are insightful and true to life, avoiding the  cliches inherent in noir sci-fi.<br />If you like noir sci-fi &amp;  libertarian politics, you should enjoy THE WARDOVE despite the numerous  typos.	2000-07-12

A vampire and her lover amidst trashy LA goth types.<br />The lead characters  are rather hollow, and the goth characters are ugly and unsympathetic.  There's also an evil vampire whom the goths end up serving, to their  misfortune.<br />I guess this book is supposed to be a commentary of some sort  on the vapid LA lifestyle.  Sort of like LESS THAN ZERO with fangs.  Lots  of bored &quot;been there, done that&quot; characters on the fringes of the  music scene.<br />It's not a &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;literary&quot; as  the author seems to intend, but it reads well.

It's hard to write about historic figures -- whether it's Lincoln, Hitler, or whomever, they usally end up sounding wooden or cliched.  Yet here, the author &quot;gets  into the head&quot; of Stalin.

Whereas FOREVER WAR was an imaginative metaphor for Vietnam, FOREVER PEACE is a dull read.<br />Is there a trend toward  domestic issues in sci-fi?  It appears so.  COSM, TERMINAL EXPERIMENT, and  now this book, all devote large chunks to the character's  &quot;issues,&quot; dysfunctions, and interpersonal problems.<br />Hey, if I  wanted that, I'd listen to some radio psychobabbler or watch Jerry  Springer.  The characters in this book would make great guests on those  shows.  And they're self-absorbed enough to enjoy doing it.  To me, the  reader, they're just boring.<br />What sci-fi elements this book contains  (jacking into one another's minds) isn't terribly original.  From some  unknown first time writer, this book would be acceptable pap.  I guess I  just expected something more from the author of THE FOREVER WAR.	2000-04-08

This book perfectly captures the culture &amp; attitudes of the city, its shrill power politics and opportunism and hypocrisy.<br />Wolfe has called this a  &quot;social novel,&quot; a once popular form, now less so.<br />The social  novel is sociological, as opposed to psychological.  It paints with a broad  brush.  Its &quot;main character&quot; is an entire city, or  profession,  or period in history (rather than the psychological novel's narrow focus on  a single individual's inner thoughts &amp; feelings).<br />This book is funny  and truthful.  And despite its thickness, a quick read, because it's also  an exciting page-turner.	2000-04-07

The wounds of Vietnam have apparently still not healed, people still feel strongly one way or another.  The author's short story about a school for &quot;CIA wives&quot; is largely a polemic in which the &quot;teacher&quot;  spouts the author's views.  We are supposed to believe that an elderly  Vietnamese woman would toss about such terms as &quot;right-wing  Republicans&quot; and &quot;mediocre bureaucrats who run the  CIA.&quot;<br />The author has first hand experience in Nam, but that can lead  to bias as well as insight.  In this case, bias has overpowered the  insight.	2000-03-26

This book effectively documents Communism's mass extermination of 100 million people.  Nothing really ground-breaking--the Communist genocide was known as early as the 1930s (Stalin had killed 7 million Ukrainians before  World War 2 even started).<br />However, since many on the Left want the world  want to forget the Communist Holocaust (in Europe and Asia and Africa and  Latin America...), it's good that this book is here to remind them.	2000-03-02
