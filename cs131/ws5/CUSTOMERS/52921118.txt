The back cover of this book states \\"Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' (1973) is one of the most beloved albums of all time.  A sonically stunning exploration into dark themes...  Besides being perhaps the most fully realized and elegant concept album ever recorded, 'The Dark Side of the Moon' [sic] was also one of the most technologically advanced LPs of its day.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, right.<br /><br />Questionable hyperbole aside, Harris starts the book with the by-now familiar story of The Pink Floyd Sound, Syd Barrett, early psychedelia, quick success, Syd's decline and the band's decision to carry on without him.  It's an interesting story, and many books and articles have mined it for dramatic appeal.<br /><br />For me, what happened next is the most interesting part -- the band throws out the pop song format and begins turning music inside out, experimenting with long drones, alternate playing techniques, and new music structures never before seen on this planet.  Their incredible inventiveness creates a whole new style of music, with a ripple effect on everything that follows.  Unfortunately, Harris is less enamored of \\"Saucerful,\\" \\"More,\\" \\"Ummagumma,\\" \\"Atom Heart,\\" \\"Meddle\\" and \\"Obscured\\" than I am, dismissing them rather cavalierly as \\"poorly realized, loose-ended stuff\\" that \\"sought, in their own ill-advised way, to test both their audience's expectations and the limits of musical orthodoxy.\\"<br /><br />Apparently musical orthodoxy is very important to author Harris, because he gets all gushy when he gets to Chapter 3 and starts relating stories of the creation of DSotM.  For those of us who LOVED the unorthodoxy and limits-testing, DSotM was a huge disappointment from day one, the episode where Pink Floyd \\"jumped the shark\\" (to use a TV metaphor), sold out and started playing to the lowest common denominator.  It was also the undeniable beginning of the end, where PF got so famous that they became prisoners of their own success.  Instead of musicians, they became commodities.  They all went off and bought mansions and were miserable.<br /><br />To Harris this is all fine.  DSotM is his favorite album in the whole world and he gathers all available material about the creation of this album.  It's a fine story as far as it goes; and Harris does a credible job of telling it; and Floyd fans will enjoy the retelling.<br /><br />I just wish John Harris knew the Pink Floyd I knew and loved.stead of musicians, they became commodities.

I had been vaguely aware of this book when it came out 2 years ago but my interest was rekindled when the 4th season of 6FU was released on DVD this summer.<br /><br />The connection with 6FU is apropos.  Both share a morbid fascination with and a nervous humor about death, and both are wildly entertaining because they skirt the bounds of propriety.<br /><br />One more television comparison:  on the Discovery Channel series \\"Mythbusters\\" they use a crash test dummy, nicknamed \\"Buster,\\" for many of their human endurance tests.  Other tests involve firing bullets, hard drive fragments or CD-ROM fragments into fake human torsos constructed of ballistic gelatin.  So I had some familiarity with \\"cadaver stand-ins\\" in the testing of human limits.<br /><br />But Mary Roach isn't interested in stand-ins.  She goes straight for the real thing, the rogue scientists who use real dead people for experiments.  It's a subject rarely spoken about, barely acknowledged by the body donation establishment.  Not all cadavers end up in dissection labs for budding surgeons.<br /><br />Roach's tone in the book, as other reviewers have noted, is irreverent without being disrespectful.  The cavalier attitudes sometimes adopted by trauma nurses in order to deal with stress seem somehow inappropriate when dealing with the already-dead.  Nothing can hurt a corpse further -- and yet there's a cultural, or perhaps evolutionary reluctance to desecrate the newly departed.  The irony is not lost on Roach.<br /><br />This is a fast and fascinating read, reminiscent perhaps of Perri Klass's work or her fellow Discover Magazine medical columnist, Jeffrey Kluger.  Roach imparts quite a bit of science and research arcana by keeping it light and chatty, and I did not find her humor annoying or out of place.  In fact, it's the perfect lubricant for making a difficult subject morbidly entertaining.a difficult subject morbidly entertaining.	2005-10-08

As a devoutly religious man during the oppressively Christian Victorian era, it took uncommon fortitude and intellectual honesty for him to follow the paths down which his researches led him, all the way to the ultimate conclusions which today bear his name.<br /><br />Much like H.W. Brands's biography of Benjamin Franklin, the authors here do an excellent job of bringing Darwin back to life, both the highs and the lows (including lots of personal tragedy) that shaped his monumental career.  Heartbreak played as great a role in his life as discovery.<br /><br />Compulsively readable without sacrificing detail, all of the major milestones of his life are covered in a personal perspective which gives exactly as much emphasis as events must have had at the time -- even ones which have since reached mythic proportions.  This is, as Steven Jay Gould touts on the cover, \\"Unquestionably, the finest [biography] ever written about Darwin...\\"	2005-09-15

I've enjoyed the Rhino and Hanna-Barbera cartoon music boxes, and of course the two Carl Stalling Project CDs.<br /><br />It was with some anticipation therefore that I picked up this book about cartoon music, with the fun-looking cartoon cover.<br /><br />To my dismay, it's a rather dry book written like a master's thesis, full of footnotes and citations (Goldmark is a professor of music history).  The author spends a lot of time identifying the sources of various cartoon themes, and presents several second-by-second breakdowns of particular cartoon soundtracks.  His text, which spends more time on the 1930s and 1940s cartoons than the 'golden era' of 1950s and 1960s, is full of such scholarly and entirely-beside-the-point observations as:<br /><br />\\"The pensive, heaving breaths taken by both characters throughout the cartoon call attention to the unnatural demands that opera singers must place on their bodies.\\"<br /><br />Well, yeah???  The best of these cartoons transcended good storytelling precisely because they didn't take themselves too seriously, and put a sense of fun above all else.  Daniel Goldmark could take a lesson here.	2005-09-03

The title \\"Mutants\\" and the lurid illustrations are SOMEWHAT misleading, because although they are used to illustrate genetic variety (and man's earliest attempts to understand it), the book is by no means ABOUT circus freaks or genetic accidents.  The book is far less sensational (in the bad sense) than a first glance would indicate.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book *IS* sensational in the good sense.  Leroi is such a fluid writer in this, his first book, that I half expect this to be a pseudonym for someone more well-known.  But then again, why would any author hide his identity with a book this good?<br /><br />Mixing humor, history, science (hard AND soft), politics, sociology, philosophy and quite a bit of good-hearted wisdom, Leroi moves easily through complexities which would prove daunting in the hands of a less-skilled guide.  He covers eugenics, phrenology, evolutionary biology, embryology, gerontology, science history and of course genetics in a seamless narrative which never feels pedantic or labored.  The reader is introduced to quite a few novel concepts, and drawn to unexpected conclusions without ever noticing how clever is the writing.<br /><br />Filled with startling facts -- and yes, mutants -- the book is as entertaining as it is informative.	2005-08-02

Not only does his prose guide the reader effortlessly through some pretty difficult science, but he also chooses subjects which are deeply fascinating and brings out points of view which you've probably never considered before.<br /><br />\\"Parasite Rex\\" is a good case in point.  The first several chapters are pretty much what you'd expect -- some case studies, a little history of parasitology, some really gnarly pictures.  Then, in the third-to-last chapter, he starts discussing the evolution of parasites and how their numbers and virulence can actually affect the evolutionary success of their hosts.<br /><br />In the second-to-last chapter he applies this viewpoint to mankind, and shows how parasitism potentially influenced man's own evolution, including the development of culture, the diaspora out of Africa, and even possibly the creation of language!<br /><br />In the last chapter, Zimmer shows how parasite loads are a barometer of species health -- completely opposite of how we normally think of parasites! -- and how a LACK of parasites may have led to the spread of autoimmune diseases in man such as allergies, colitis and Crohn's disease.  By the end of the book you're actually rooting for parasites!<br /><br />Now THAT is good writing.	2005-06-30

Darwin showed that this diversity is the result of the slow accumulation of mutations over geologic time, rather than a biblical \\"special creation\\" in historic times.<br /><br />The second revolution was the 1918 emergence of the Modern Synthesis, explaining the genetic basis for heritability and mutation.  It finally laid to rest the long-standing debate over Lamarckian \\"inheritance of acquired characteristics,\\" since acquired traits can't affect the genes.  Gregor Mendel had published \\"laws in inheritance\\" as early as 1866, but the mechanism for these laws had to wait for the discovery of the gene in 1900.<br /><br />The third revolution, and the subject of this excellent book, is the appearance over the past 20 years of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, dubbed by the author \\"Evo Devo\\" for short.  This is the study of how embryos develop into their adult forms, through the expression (turning off and on) of various standard genes ('the genetic toolkit') during development.  It turns out that all living things share a surprising percentage of basic genes -- 98.8% shared between man and chimpanzies, but also 96% between mice and men!  The basic 'toolkit' genes for eye-building not only build our camera-like eyes, but a fly's compound eyes as well.  How could such major anatomical differences arise from shared genes?<br /><br />The answer is the author's subject here, and it's a breakthrough in modern understanding.  Through examples and principles, in layman's terms Carroll explains the recent discoveries in Evo Devo and how these strengthen and support Darwinism.  Other modifications of Darwinism, such as Gould-Eldredge's Punctuated Equilibria, are also explained and fitted into the new understanding.  The mechanisms behind the Cambrian Explosion in diversity of form are finally explained, as are the subsequent whittling to just a few of the most-successful bodystyles.<br /><br />In fact this Evolutionary Developmental Biology stuff fills a big gap in Darwin's original thesis, which explained how unfit individuals and species were weeded out but could not explain where new forms came from.  The new understanding of gene expression, and 'switch gene' mutations, goes a long way toward making sense of the whole picture of the evolution of life.<br /><br />Fascinating, eye-opening and highly recommended!he mechanisms behind the Cambrian Explosion in diversity of form are finally explained, as are the subsequent whittling to just a few of the most-successful bodystyles.   <br /> <br />In fact this Evolutionary Developmental Biology stuff fills a big gap in Darwin's original thesis, which explained how unfit individuals and species were weeded out but could not explain where new forms came from.

This story is told with humor, wit, intelligence and charming self-deprecation as he insinuates himself into the troop (as one of the lower-ranking members).<br /><br />But the book is much more that that.<br /><br />Tangental to that story is another journey which quietly becomes the spinal cord of the book.  It is the story of how a naîve Brooklyn 20-year-old becomes a seasoned, wily and somewhat more cynical field researcher, able to navigate the murky waters of local politics and tribal customs.  The author slowly grows up during the pages of this book, ending up a much wiser and more useful individual.  The book is cleverly written to lead you to this conclusion without ever denigrating his earlier idealism.<br /><br />In this, the author's journey recalls a very different journey, that of a war photographer coming of age, told by Deborah Copaken Kogan in her excellent book \\"Shutterbabe.\\"  Sapolsky's memoir is in direct contrast to several other African adventures written by middle-class whites, most notably Mark & Delia Owens (who by their second book are parading around in a Unimog, a sort of &uuml;berHummer for researchers) or Louis Sarno (who succumbs to self-delusional patronage among his beloved Pygmies.)  Sapolsky at least \\"gets it\\" that he is the outsider in a foreign land.<br /><br />I found this book in equal measures thought-provoking, heart-warming, heart-breaking and provocative.  It was one of those rare books that flew by quickly because you want to keep turning the pages, but at the same time you want to slow down and savor every word.  A marvelous read.	2005-05-26

He compares their emancipation to the gradual emergence of equal rights for slaves and women, and the growing consensus that unborn fetuses have legal 'personhood' after viability.<br /><br />However, not addressed in his argument is the fact that the above rights have been hard-fought and won only after extended legal battle.  In each case, either the maligned victim or legal representation for the victim has taken the legal system to task in redefining the law to expand human rights.<br /><br />Who will speak for animal rights?  Without strong legal basis for such a change -- and one might cynically add 'strong financial basis' -- such rights are not likely to be conferred based on logic and compassion alone.<br /><br />Wise's treatise is thought provoking and addresses an important turning point in human history, as Christian law principles become more and more incompatible with modern understanding, but it suffers from an unfortunate streak of idealism.	2005-05-14

In a nutshell this incident defines both what is worst about this book, and why is it so compelling.<br /><br />The author's personal biases are never far from the surface, although he manages to keep them from being too intrusive.  Each chapter takes a different emotion -- fear, anger, compassion, shame, love, etc. -- and presents some evidence, usually anecdotal and apocryphal, about non-human animals that have displayed this emotion.  There is no attempt to be comprehensive or authoritative; rather he picks and chooses examples which support his overriding proposition.  Like Kristen von Kreisler (for whom he wrote the forward to her last book), the accumulated weight of a bunch of apocryphal stories will only convince the already-converted, but for those of us who share his bias the stories are heart-warming.<br /><br />Where he falls down is in putting this evidence in context.  He automatically assumes -- as a vegetarian -- that anyone who appreciates the emotions and intellect of animals would be unable to eat them or perform scientific experiments on them.  Despite recounting tales of lions purring over a recent kill and cheetahs tenderly cleaning the face of their dinner, Masson sticks to his uniquely-human conviction that eating meat is morally reprehensible.  He does not admit to the possibility that animal researchers could own pets, could separate their love for INDIVIDUAL animals from their careers investigating intentionally-anonymous lab animals.<br /><br />In short, his is a very single-minded morality.<br /><br />Without the undercurrent of ethical superiority this book would have rated five stars.	2005-05-08

Science is still more concerned with putting animals in cages, testing them with various horrors, and then dissecting them to look for physiological changes.  The idea that non-humans could share anything with humankind besides 90% of our genes is frowned upon by a deeply-conservative scientific community, which is still struggling out of biblical tree-of-life and dominion-over-earth strictures.<br /><br />So if von Kreisler occasionally seems breathlessly willing to ascribe every maternal instinct to conscious intention, she can be forgiven for overstatement to make a point.  And after 200 pages of amazing-if-true examples, the evidence behind her argument develops a weight which is hard to deny.	2005-04-22

Dawkins is a lecturer at Oxford, and this book reads like an afternoon in the classroom with her.  She uses that annoying convention teachers have developed for dealing with hung-over, inattentive students where she first tells you what she's going to tell you, then she tells you, then she tells you what she just told you.  It makes a short book longer, but the reader may not appreciate being treated like a 17-year old.<br /><br />It isn't until the final chapter that Dawkins even begins to address the issue of what 'consciousness' is.  She recounts the Behavioralists screed that if it can't be measured and counted, it can't be studied, and then goes on to say that what passes for consciousness can be inferred from behavior.  If she had just taken this tone from the beginning of the book, instead of couching everything in terrified scientific caution, her book might have had the power of Kristin von Kreisler's \\"Beauty in the Beasts,\\" which shares its cover and subject matter.<br /><br />Dawkins is a student of (figuratively if not literally) Donald Griffin and Griffin's own \\"Animal Thinking\\" presents much the same argument in a tidier package.<br /><br />Neither author however is willing to take the leap to assigning consciousness in varying degrees -- to them it's an all-or-nothing, black-or-white distinction.  Either you have it -- or you don't.<br /><br />It seems much more likely to me that consciousness is not a threshold, but a continuum, with some animals and humans being intensely self-aware and other animals and politicians having only the dimmest idea of their place in the world.	2005-04-14

In Aud Torvingen, Griffith has created a sort of superhero for our time -- impervious to pain, oblivious of broken bones, unstoppable by bullets, operating outside the law but tolerated by the police because of her effectiveness...  There are tons of crime-novel characters in this Sly/Arnold/Bruce mold but what makes Griffith's Aud Torvingen relevant to today is that she is a woman ... and a lesbian.<br /><br />Not that these really have any effect on the story -- there are no sex scenes (and only one attempted seduction), and as mentioned by another reviewer below, ALL OF THE WOMEN in Griffith's novels have always been gay, or at least bi.  So her sexuality is a non-issue, not affecting employment, enjoyment or denouement.<br /><br />In a way that's refreshing, as it assumes an attitude of total acceptance on the reader's part which should be the author's right.<br /><br />But we both know the world isn't like that, and it nags in the back of the reader's mind.<br /><br />Aud's character is nicely drawn, as her grieving over a dead lover colors most everything.  She is strong and resourceful, working hard to get over the loss, so the reader definitely invests in her well-being.  The trials and intrigues she endures keep the novel edgy and action-filled, and for the most part the secondary characters are sympathetically treated and believable.  I especially commend Griffith for her portrait of a fundamentalist Christian couple in the story, which could have turned into a caricature but instead was treated with respect and dignity.<br /><br />Overall, this is a multi-faceted novel with a lot of heart, even if certain base assumptions require a suspension of disbelief.	2005-04-10

Ed Sanders -- poet, musician, ex-Fug, founder of the Peace-Eye Bookstore, cultural attach&eacute; and all around degenerate -- has written a number of books but this one is perhaps his best.  Subtitled \\"A Novel of the Yippies\\" it is not so much a novel as a series of disconnected short fantasies from his fecund (and very dangerous) imagination.<br /><br />The watchword here is \\"shock value.\\"  Everything Sanders writes is with the intent of opening up the reader, breaking down cultural norms, tearing apart expectations and propriety and building up a new medium of infinite possibilities.  He populates his stories with real people like Abbie & Anita Hoffman, Jerry & Nancy Rubin, Keith Lampe, Paul Krassner and many others, and describes some real events like the exorcism of the Pentagon, the 1968 Democratic Convention, etc. but he includes an equal number of made-up, totally outrageous people and events.  He writes deliriously of sex, drugs and rock & roll of course, but then he carries everything to extreme -- bestiality, cannibalism, UFOs, the men are all unstoppable Gods and the women are unquenchable Goddesses.  By making everything in mythic proportion, he creates his own universe of limitless possibilities.<br /><br />Some of the references in \\"Shards of God\\" seem quaint 35 years later (LBJ, Mayor Daley, Ho Chi Minh) but others were surprisingly prescient (\\"Computer Worship\\" and instant sharing of information.)  Although most definitely a product OF his time, Sanders was (and is) by no means CONFINED to his time.<br /><br />Sanders and his coterie bridge the gap between the \\"beatnik\\" generation (Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Kerouac) who were just breaking free of convention, and the \\"hippie\\" generation that followed (Brautigan, Wolfe, Kesey on into Douglas Adams and Jonathan Lethem).  In Sanders' hands we see the literature of freedom coming to life, even as the frantic drive to always be shocking begins, in the end, to get ironically wearying.	2005-03-31

William Poundstone's previous books on logic, philosophy and science have long been favorites of mine, so a book on, ostensibly, interviewing at Microsoft sounded intriguing.<br /><br />Actually, the book's cover is somewhat misleading -- Microsoft reportedly doesn't use puzzle questions (much) anymore, and Poundstone spends almost as much time recounting the history of IQ testing, the psychology of puzzles, and pondering the changes in modern industrial workers -- so this book actually fits right in with Poundstone's other works.<br /><br />Do puzzles really measure intelligence?  Nope, high aptitude at puzzle solving measures only one thing -- the ability to solve puzzles -- as Poundstone points out while discussing the curious membership of Mensa.  And most observers today agree that no single parameter can define intelligence, which is a many-faceted and only-dimly-understood concept anyway.<br /><br />Perhaps most revealingly, Poundstone recounts studies which show that an interviewer usually makes up his mind about a candidate within the first few seconds of meeting her, and the rest of the interview is merely an exercise in confirming first impressions.<br /><br />So much for careful testing, eh?	2005-03-20

A Canadian-Japanese woman discovers that her father, recently deceased, not only fought in WWII, he fought for the Japanese side.  Not only that, but he was trained as a tokubetsu kôgeki tai, the famed \\"kamikaze\\" pilots whose only purpose was to die in a blaze of glory for their emperor.<br /><br />Unfortunately for her father the war ended before he could fulfill his mission.  This causes him great shame among the Japanese people -- and an opposing shame among his non-Japanese neighbors back home in Toronto.  Ostracized by both of his worlds, he retreats into silence and never speaks of his war experience to anyone.  It is left to his daughter to discover his secrets and the key to unlocking his curious life only after he passes away.<br /><br />Other secrets arise to be discovered along the way, and the daughter, Miyo, has to confront her own sense of self-worth and find her place between two opposing worlds, one ancient and one modern.<br /><br />It's a great premise and started out to be a great novel.  Unfortunately the author takes some missteps along the way, which could include the shifting point of view mentioned by the other reviewers, an undue concentration on peripheral characters, some very unlikely-sounding letters home, and an inexplicable abandonment of the promising and nuanced story of the daughter's relationship with her Caucasian boyfriend.  The last third of the book falls apart in your hand, like the cherry blossoms used as a recurring theme earlier on.<br /><br />Three hard-earned stars for the premise and early development, which are quite deserving of them.	2005-03-20

Fueled by an influx of American ex-pat jazz musicians seeking color neutrality, the new portability of music with cassettes and portable radios, the worldwide spirit of experimentation, new instrument technologies and, yes, the popularity of psychedelics, the resulting body of work has been nobly documented by brothers Steven & Alan Freeman.<br /><br />Other books cover some of the same ground -- Archie Patterson's \\"Eurock\\" and Dag Erik Asbjornsen's \\"Cosmic Dreams at Play\\" for two -- but none are more comprehensive or more compulsively readable than \\"Cosmic Egg.\\"  The level of detail and fair, reasonable analysis make this the gold standard against which all others are measured.	2005-03-11

Most science fiction assumes \\"little green men\\" with bilateral symmetry and carbon-based morphology (think \\"Twilight Zone\\" with bad rubber masks).  Hoyle was one of the few to theorize information-processing as the hallmark of life and/or intelligence, rather than some biological definition.

It was pretty obvious from the start that this was where the story was headed.<br /><br />Even without a surprise ending however the book was enjoyable.  The author brings in quite a bit of learning -- pharmacology, psychological theories, knowledge structure, personality profiling -- and he will make you really THINK about the nature of attraction between two people.  Like Grisham or Crichton the author manages to teach you quite a bit while entertaining you.<br /><br />\\"Death Match\\" loses a star only for the rather far-fetched premise, and the conceit that there could be such a thing as a \\"perfect match\\" between any two inherently imperfect humans.	2005-01-21

The author admits right up front in the introduction that the book is a compilation of other peoples' conspiracy theories, with no original research or even fact checking by the author.  It is in short a Cliffs Notes on 9/11 conspiracies.<br /><br />There is no pretense of being the final word on anything.  The author hopes that by throwing a whole lot of allegations against the wall maybe some of them will stick.  To Griffin's credit he takes a very dispassionate, reasonable viewpoint and invites the reader to engage his or her scepticism and question all assumptions.  He avoids the shrill tone and messianic demeanor of most anti-Bush crusaders.  The theories Griffin recounts range from patently ludicrous to highly unlikely.  As reviewer Shawn McCullion points out, for most of these conspiracies to be plausible the sheer number of conspirators would have to be staggering -- FBI, FAA, Secret Service, military, oval office and many, many others.  The intelligence and coordination required to pull off a scheme of this size -- and get away with it, with nobody spilling the beans -- surpasses credibility.<br /><br />No, it's probably much more likely that massive unconscionable failures in intelligence, military readiness, administration leadership and counter-terrorism efforts led to a realization of the \\"worst case scenario\\" on 9/11.<br /><br />This is hardly more comforting, of course.	2004-11-20

It's about different ways to integrate computing power into our lives so the distinction about \\"what is a computer\\" starts to blur.<br /><br />Wearable computers, smart coffepots, tennis shoes with CPUs, all of these are ideas which have become much more accepted (and real) in the 5 years since this book was published.<br /><br />There are two directions computing can grow in the future -- automating tasks we already do (like the above) or, more promisingly, creating new tasks which take advantage of the advantages of computing power.  Gershenfeld barely touches on the latter, even though examples are all around us (like the internet).  Futurists working on films like Blade Runner, Demolition Man and Minority Report have had more to say.  It is only when computing power starts to change the way we live our lives -- for better or worse -- that the true digital revolution will occur.<br /><br />And it probably will be televised.	2004-11-19

The complex plot machinations, the cast of dozens, the apocalyptic political vision, and a minimum of eye-popping technological progress 40 years into the future all conspired to make this a fairly grueling read.<br /><br />This is NOT a sequel or prequel to The Forever War, which is a much more readable and enjoyable book.

I still think \\"The Black Hole Passes\\" is one of the best short stories I've ever read.  Well, maybe second to \\"The Last of the Winnebagos.\\"<br /><br />But as the decade turned, Varley began to lose me -- the Titan trilogy was twee, with way too much wizardry and not enough science.  Millennium, Steel Beach and Blue Champagne had their moments, but were nowhere near his potential.  And to tell the truth, I never even finished The Golden Globe.<br /><br />So it was with considerably lowered expectations that I began Red Thunder, but I was soon flabbergasted to see the old John back in form after his devastating brush with acclaim.  Oh, the novel may read a bit like a Heinlein juvenile, or my personal description \\"Huck Finn in Space,\\" but these are hardly derogatory descriptions are they.  He kept the pace exactly right, the characters imaginatively and believably drawn, the science plausibly glossed-over, and the arc of the story predictable without seeming overly automatic.  One could quibble about certain scientific assumptions -- thrust in space, navigation by sight, lack of shielding at 3 million mph -- but these would be beside the point.<br /><br />The point is, this story was classic Varley, with all the humor, good nature, wit and clever plotting that caused me to fall in love with him 30 years ago.<br /><br />It's good to have you back, John.	2004-10-28

These take place all over the world -- in China, France, Japan, Brazil, a First American reservation and others -- told with a long litany of unfamiliar place-names.<br /><br />There's a certain air of cultural imperialism in the stories though, as the protagonist of each describes his or her reactions to the indigenous culture without ever adopting or accepting the culture.  It is assumed that the culture will adapt to the central character rather than vice versa.  In this way the stories are never about 'fitting in' but more about 'sticking out.'  The central voice, a sincere but somewhat hardened personality, varies little from story to story, despite wildly varying circumstances. In the end I found the 'resistance' of the real author to any kind of role-playing somewhat off-putting.	2004-10-17

You get to spend at least a chapter inside each character's head, and the author does a great job of bringing the characters to life.<br /><br />The Seattle setting is completely accurate, including lots of little out-of-the-way spots only a native knows.  Apparently the author's father works at the University of Washington hospital, which explains it.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed by the way the plot was SO realistic -- no dramatic denouement, no resolution to several characters' turmoils, no good guys or bad guys... this was refreshing in a way but, novelistically, curiously unsatisfying.

Anderson has a long-standing interest in issues of identity and body-image -- witness his \\"Resurrection Inc.\\" from several years ago. In this book he postulates a \\"what if\\" involving the ability to move personalities from body to body.  In a more thoughtful treatment this could have been a philosophical exploration of packaging vs. contents, of what makes us who we are (nature vs. nurture), or even an exploration of the differences between the sexes, or between the generations, or between races.<br /><br />Instead what we get is a longwinded detective novel with \\"hopscotching\\" as a mere backdrop.  There are a lot of major plot holes and untidy ends (such as any explanation of hopscotching itself) and when the author writes himself into a pickle he's not above creating new characters, new powers or new conditions to pull himself out.  The story is not only sloppily-plotted, the writing is wooden, with stilted dialog and  unconvincing characters.  As other reviewers have noted, the passage of time is jerky and off-putting, and the book's 1950s morality is loudly anachronistic.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but Anderson's involvement writing series novels for Star Wars, X-Files and Dune does not seem to have instilled good discipline.	2004-09-27

Sam Altman is a counterculture rebel who never quite fits in, from a dysfunctional family to a rock band to school and drugs and running from the law.  He meets and falls in love with Lindy, another refugee from a broken home, and their joint discovery is full of passion and told with bracing eroticism.  However it is upon discovering mountain climbing that he finds his true calling, and together he and Lindy explore the mountains of Washington and Alaska.<br /><br />Beautifully un-clich&eacute;d, the author displays a mastery of language uncommon in a first novel.  The descriptive passages of Alaskan wilderness are powerful and evocative, with no detail too small to be held up for appreciation.  \\"The poplars clapped in the breeze.  The fireweed verging the lake was smoking with seed.  A shorebird followed the water's edge, but no matter how he cut and zagged, his shadow stayed right behind him.\\"  Or this image: \\"Beyond, the lake was sinuous, waves crawling its surface like silver eels.\\"  Or this: \\"Just then, the dawn glowed in the east, washing the glacier with soft pastels, turning everything around them pink and mauve and baby blue.  It was a moment of infinite delicacy, and Ransom felt in those colors a presence, generous and understanding.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately Sam - or Ransom as he begins calling himself - also starts dressing up as a mountain goat and taking LSD while climbing.  This leads, as one might expect, to some pretty scary moments on the slopes, which get scarier and more surreal as the book progresses.  Lindy is the classic \\"enabler\\" (in the language of 12-step), allowing and encouraging her husband's ascent into madness in order to get his grudging appreciation.  Ransom is writing a book about his experiences - coincidentally called Wild Animus --  which eventually intersects with Rich Shapero's Wild Animus somewhere to the left of rationality.<br /><br />Part travelogue, part love story, part cautionary tale, Wild Animus is a unique novel from a bold voice.

The trends Reich lays out -- toward globalization of capital, outsourcing of labor, the internationalizing of information through the internet and the growing Third World distrust of &quot;American ideals&quot; -- continue unabated in 2004 just as he said they would. He provides a clear analysis of why American hegemony in manufacturing evaporated in the '60s & '70s, and how this led inevitably in the '80s & '90s to the shrinkage of the middle class. He shows why the rich continue to get richer (through PACs) while the poor get poorer (through withdrawing from a system which continues to abandon them). Although the book is not overtly political, he exposes &quot;Reaganomics,&quot; the trickle-down theory and their current euphemisms as self-aggrandizing pandering to political contributors. Contrary to some reactionary reviewers, Reich does NOT advocate a return to progressive income taxation (which created the biggest consumer boom in history), because he acknowledges it's too late for that.<br /><br /> Throughout, his text is very concise and direct, without an extraneous word.<br /><br /> He loses a star only for the last chapter, which is a utopian and not-very-convincing prescription for a way out of the morass. He no doubt felt a responsibility to provide some sort of solution after 300 pages of problems -- but his days with the Clinton administration immediately following the publication of this book may have disabused him of such easy answers.	2004-08-06

The strengths of the TV show are in the production; it's not the actors or sets which make it special but the way the show is assembled.  It would be difficult therefore if not impossible to capture the unique flavor of the show in a non-moving medium.<br /><br />The book tries mightily -- scrapbook entries from the characters' earlier lives, details of documents mentioned only in passing on the show, additional background on the family members and lots and lots of photos.  But all this information strikes me as somewhat beside the point, because it's not the characters or the sets which make 6FU what it is.  For dedicated 6FU fans the indulgence is a warm fuzzy experience, but it's not like experiencing ths show.<br /><br />The elaborate packaging and kaleidoscopic content look for all the world like a Marshall McLuhan book -- whose message the book bears out.	2004-08-02

Few people in politics are driven by ideals anymore, which makes Reich's laser focus on improving economic inequity all the more laudable. And doomed.<br /><br /> In fact, this book explains a whole lot about how & why Clinton's first term of office became such a disappointment. &quot;B&quot; (as Reich, a longtime FoB, calls him) was elected with a mandate, he was young and energetic, he was idealistic and he was determined to improve the social disasters left by 12 years of voodoo economics. But he was also a classic Washington Outsider who did not have the requisite skills of playing Congress like a fiddle as FDR, JFK & LBJ had with their progressive terms. Consequently Clinton's agenda became a losing political football even under a majority Democratic Congress. When Congress passed back into Republican hands in 1994 (in large part due to Clinton's own fumbling) his effectiveness was cut off at the knees by Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America. From then on, B was in full-time CYA mode, relying on Dick Morris's polling of voters to decide all policy issues. The result -- and ultimately the indignity of the impeachment attempt -- are all too familiar and preordained. Alas Bill, we hardly knew thee...<br /><br /> Reich's book is fascinating, thought provoking, brutally frank and often hilariously funny.

He presents a roadmap for putting the American economy back on track after two decades of Republican social engineering -- bought and paid for by powerful special interests.<br />Too bad this nation stands little chance of electing a short Jewish president, because in Reich we find the vision and idealism sadly lacking from politics of the last generation.  Our universally tall soundbite presidents have removed IDEAS and IDEALS from the public forum, replacing them with deceptive smirks, homey aphorisms and big hairdos.  When Thomas Paine envisioned a country self-governed by the common men, I'll bet he never imagined the Barnum &amp; Bailey cynicism of appealing to Joe Sixpack with one hand while simultaneously selling him out to corporate greed with the other.<br />&quot;I'll Be Short&quot; loses a couple stars for being intentionally vague about how to pay for rebuilding America, although this does not diminish the power of the message.	2004-07-20

Franklin's story is an amazing one, which the author tells in a style both fast and entertaining.  He never goes into more detail than the casual reader (me) would like, but gives just enough historical perspective and philosophical framework to place Franklin in his time.  Franklin's life was so full and far-ranging that it couldn't be covered in less than 700 well-manicured pages.  I found it compulsively readable, despite the size.  Truly he lived in &quot;interesting times&quot; and showed himself to be a man equal to every challenge he faced -- and quite a few left to future generations.<br />The true measure of a biography may be in getting the reader to CARE about the subject, and in this Brands succeeds unconditionally.  Even from the distance of 200 years Franklin's inevitable passing hit me hard, moving me to tears of sorrow.<br />THAT is good writing.	2004-07-01

How the Panama Canal is absolutely dependent on rainfall.  Why a vacant lot outside Chicago gives hope for environmental recovery.  How global warming may simply be part of a normal 12,000 year ice age cycle.<br />In all this was an attractive, well-written book with a lot of important information -- but somehow I expected more from the co-author of the Punctuated Equilibrium theory.

Her much-vaunted list of &quot;things you cannot do if you're married&quot; reads like a list of pre-teen temper tantrums: leaving dishes in the sink, clothes on the floor, hair in the drain, etc.  These have nothing to do with love or marriage, and everything to do with being grown up.<br />Some authors spend years researching the lives of a historical figure in minute detail before writing the definitive biography.

Some of the backgrounds in Thai brothels may be a bit sleazy for some readers, but the insight into the &quot;magical realism&quot; of Buddhist thought I found fascinating.<br />The book introduces a few too many unexpected plot twists in the later chapters, some of which strain credulity, but these did not outweigh the supreme joy of discovery in the first half.	2003-08-31

Langston, the central character, is throughout most of the book almost a caricature of the smug, self-centered and insufferably selfish &quot;professional student.&quot;  She was exceedingly well drawn as a character, being both familiar AND infuriating -- but I kept expecting her to undergo some emotional growth during the unfolding of the story.  Unfortunately, she arrives at the terminus without ever boarding that train.<br />Second, Kimmel's portrait of the pastor Amos Townsend is absolutely spot-on; his doubts, his discipline, his soul-searching and his embarrassment at landing in a series of dead-end parishes.  Although the reader could see from the outset how the two lead characters are perfect for each other, Kimmel's slow dance of bringing them together builds a lovely tension.  Too bad the book wasn't about 8 chapters longer so she could have resolved that tension realistically.<br />And last, I am puzzled by the title.  There is no &quot;solace&quot; in Langston's decision to abandon her PhD in mid-exam; it is a decision she neither understands nor one she can live with.  And there is no &quot;leaving early&quot; in the overall arc of the novel -- in the end boy-gets-girl.  There's certainly no comfort for the troubled children, nor for any of the rear-stage cast who all have their own problems.  In short, it seems like a title chosen by a publicist.<br />To sum up, a flawed novel to be sure, but not one without rewards.  Some really stunning writing makes me look forward to her next novel.	2003-07-30

First is a novel about coming to grips with the possibility that the people you think you know best -- your father, your mother, your siblings, your spouse, your child, and most importantly, yourself -- may not be at all what you think.  Real people have layers and depths which even a lifetime together might not reveal.  To a very large degree we are all putting up fronts of how we want to be seen, and like the facade on a building, our 'public face' may or may not reflect the actual construction beneath.<br />Veronesi's second story is the interior monologue we all perform, questioning ourselves and the events around us in a constant assessment of the world and our place in it.  This Proustian 'stream-of-consciousness' has never been so well depicted as in Gianni Orzan's story, as the central character effortlessly glides between the here-and-now and remembrances of things past.  It 'illuminates' (in the Medieval sense) the story of his life (story one), giving the reader a rare first-person glimpse into the depths of the soul.<br />Working your way through the novel is like being on an archeological dig, digging down through buried layers to bring up something tangible, something that can be held up as truth.  It is a process of discovery which both satisfies, and unsettles you as you begin to think about the unseen history around you.	2003-07-20

There are so many things about the story which would have to be explained -- and I can't really go into them without giving away too much of the book -- suffice it to say that some of the central threads of this story just didn't wash.<br />Although engagingly written, from the very beginning I had difficulty suspending disbelief and immersing myself in the story, and the book never redeemed itself in the end.

At the heart of it, the &quot;story&quot; of this novel is one-sentence-simple, so all the fluff surrounding it not only fills it out but also gives it depth and universality.

There is a tight, complicated, serpentine (even overwrought) thriller between these covers.<br />But that's not important.<br />Buy this book for the setting, the characters, the absolutely awe-inspiring vision of a world totally run by mega-corporations.  A world where McDonalds schools compete against Pepsi schools and Mattel schools to see who has the best product tie-ins.  A world where you can't call 9-1-1 without your credit card number because the police are just another profit-making corporation.  A world where the goverment itself has been privatized.

The author's grasp of over-the-top marketing techniques probably sounded clever to him at the time, but it's hard to out-gutter-dive Madison Avenue and Hollywood, who have made his satirical novel seem rather tame in the 4 years since it was published.<br />In a battle of style-versus-substance, I wish this novel had a bit more in the plot department but obviously it isn't meant to be the GAN and it isn't.  Just a reckless romp through the absurd world of marketing, in a Spider Robinsonesque abandon.	2003-07-15

This was a drive for independence which arose from the farmers and tradespeople, not the politicians -- and it was predicated on the principle that government should be &quot;of the people, by the people and for the people.&quot;<br />It was not just a revolution against the British monarchy, it was a revolution in thought, a paradigm shift, that people could and should govern themselves, and would do a better job of it than any inherited bloodline.<br />These thoughts are just as revolutionary today, and still bear defending against modern advocates of aristocracies and plutocracies.	2003-07-11

Like Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; the lesson is that civilization is only skin-deep, and that if any of the delicate prerequisites -- even sight -- is removed, the facade quickly collapses.<br />Saramago purposely assigns no names to his characters or their locale, giving the story a mythic quality.

Officer Clausen's second book is just as good as his first, &quot;First Avenue,&quot; but in a different way.  Here he writes not one, not two, but THREE very sympathetic and believable female characters (rare for a man).  He also devotes a few chapters to the interior monologues of Daniel, the 8-year old central character of this story, and these are rendered with sensitivity and insight without condescension.  He even creates a character who is homeless-by-choice, whom he neither vilifies nor glorifies.  These are difficult tightropes to walk, and Clausen dances fearlessly across the rope.<br />The Seattle locations are so accurate that I recognized most of them immediately before he even named them.  I think I've even met some of the background characters who work there!<br />The story is a tough, gritty crime novel which has at its center some crimes which are not easy to watch transpire, so this is not a lightweight or casual book.  It is, however, a very well-crafted novel which is at least as good as his first.<br />That's high praise indeed.	2003-06-15

If you have been entranced by the music of Central Africa as the author and many people around the world have, this part of the book will feed your hunger for more information.<br />However, not only is the second half tediously devoted to a delusional one-way \\"love affair,\\" but the author also reveals himself, unintentionally, to be the worst kind of corrupting influence.  By buying the Pygmies cigarettes, English machetes, western clothing, coffee, radios, and liquor, he actively promotes the very destruction of their culture that he elsewhere decries.  Only late in the book does he reveal that his integration into the Pygmy society is not so total as he would have you believe earlier on -- reserving mosquito nets and hot cocoa for himself, relying on the Pygmies to wait on him like royalty, bring him meals and built huts for him while he lays around contemplating the thatched roof.  He seems to revel in the role of the \\"rich white patron\\" who can command the Pygmies to dance for him at will, but then is genuinely puzzled when his intended bride rebuffs his demeaning Western imperialism.<br />What's not said in the book is often more interesting that what was -- only after you finish it do you begin to see the true story behind the story.	2003-05-22

When she discovered one of them was secretly being cruel to the animals, she laid down an ultimatim -- either the cruel doctor had to be fired or she'd quit.<br />The director of the clinic thought it over and wisely decided in her favor.  Such devotion to her patients cannot be taught, and in the end is much more valuable than experience or seniority.<br />Veronika says she knew she wanted to be a vet from the time she was a toddler -- after reading this book you will believe her.

For those of us who grew up in this milieu, Pat is as much part of our family as J.P. Patches, Stan Boreson and Dick Balch.  Pat's influence, both locally and -- thanks to his Concerts West booking agency -- nationally, is probably immeasurable.<br />And he knows it.  This is not the story of a modest man with modest dreams... no, it's a grand story full of entertainment's biggest names, with O'Day up there on the podium.  You name it, Pat was probably there.  He tells hilarious anecdotes about musicians and the music business of course, but also harrowing tales of those wonderful/horrible times.  O'Day has an almost Tony Robbins enthusiasm for life, and his story is entertaining in roughly the same way that an avalanche is persuasive.<br />As a memoir of a man, it is almost too jam-packed to be believable.  As the memoir of a whole generation -- of turbulent times and unprecendented changes in the world, witnessed by millions who today make up [shudder] Adult Society -- Pat proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was, afterall, just rock 'n roll.	2003-01-20

The first \\"story\\" reads like a scholarly treatise on phrenology (complete with massive footnotes) which keeps wandering off the point into discussions of sexual morals, Freud, and murder.  The next story is a disjointed series of conversations about reincarnation. The third is a history of the Northwest Coast Indian tradition of Potlatches.  Next a chapter on the medical effects of DES on the reproductive systems of girls born to mothers who took the drug.<br />And so it goes.  None of the stories really develops any narrative tone, and none becomes particularly engaging, being rather dry and scholarly.  Some of the information presented might be pretty intriguing, if it can be relied upon to be factual -- but as this is a book of \\"short stories\\" I'm just as inclined to disbelieve the \\"facts.\\"<br />In short, this book seems at a loss for its reason for existing: Is it entertainment?

These rights are protected only so long as watchful citizens jealously guard them, and Dan seems to be one of the few speaking out.  One hopes his message reaches well beyond the narrow demographic who can be expected to read him.<br />Unfortunately his tone in this otherwise-important book keeps slouching toward whining, pleading and preaching to the converted -- not unlike the &quot;conservative scolds&quot; he keeps scolding.  I lost track of how many times he invoked Krispy Kremes and Bill O'Reilly as emblematic of the nation's ills.

William Bennett, Robert Bork, Pat Buchanan, Dr. Laura, Jerry Falwell and Bill O'Reilly all take their turn on the chopping block as author Dan Savage traverses the country in search of hot spots where he hopes to commit each of the seven deadly sins. <br />And he nearly succeeds. <br />In one of the book's funniest episodes, Savage calls a prayer line that he found advertised on a Christian cable network, only to be informed that as a gay man who cannot marry, he is doomed to a life of fornication and shall never rise to adulterer status (he is reassured that \\"fire is fire\\" and he's bound for hell right alongside the adulterers). <br />\\"Skipping Towards Gomorrah\\" is funny. Parts of it are laugh-out-loud funny, but as one would expect from Dan Savage - author of \\"The Kid,\\" regular contributor to \\"This American Life,\\" and editor and sex columnist for The Stranger - this book is not for the prudish. It's replete with four-letter words and anatomical descriptions that will make Mom blush, although Savage's forays uncover interesting and entirely unexpected snippets of American culture. <br />Hoping to indulge himself in a little \\"Falwell-style\\" gluttony, Savage attends a conference sponsored by the National Association for the Advancement of Fat Acceptance (NAAFA) in San Francisco. He soon realizes that the meeting is little more than a thinly-veiled meat market. BBWs (big, beautiful women) attend primarily to try and attract an FA (fat admirer). <br />In Las Vegas, Savage attends the annual Lifestyles Organization (LSO) convention which hosts a weekend of frolicking for more than 3,000, mostly suburban, \\"playcouples.\\" He calculates that with many such groups across the country, there are more people involved in organized swinging than the entire gay male population, underlining the irony that while swinging is ignored by conservatives as a fossil from the '70s, gay marriage is blasted as an irreproachable threat to the American family. <br />Savage begins each chapter by detailing the historical legacy of one of the seven deadly sins - greed, lust, sloth, gluttony, envy, pride and anger - pulling references from the likes of Dante and Saint Jerome on gluttony and Peraldus, a 13th-century Dominican friar, on envy. He ends each chapter with ruminations on the appeal of the sin. We gamble not because we are greedy, but because our lives are too safe and predictable. We need sloth because of increasingly hectic schedules. <br />Savage does pull a few surprises. He points out that Osama bin Laden and Jerry Falwell harbor similar ideologies. They both hate liberated women, sexual freedom, secular culture and fundamental human rights. But then he goes on to unconditionally support the war on Afghanistan. In the chapter on pride, he offers a strong argument against gay pride, claiming that the gay community has moved far enough forward that simply being out is no longer challenging enough to merit full-fledged pride for most. In the chapter on anger, he begins with a long and eloquent gun rant, only to blow a hole the size of Texas in his argument by admitting that he intends to take up shooting, having discovered in the Lone Star State that, lo and behold, he's a natural shot. <br />\\"Skipping Towards Gomorrah\\" conveys the strong impression that it was not written for kindred spirits but for those it attacks. Savage seems to hope that his words will reach - and irritate - his nemeses. He admits to having devoured their books, and his title itself is a play on \\"Slouching Towards Gomorrah\\" by Robert Bork. <br />But ultimately, one has to wonder what all the fuss is about. If Bork, Bennett and Buchanan on one side, and Savage and his friends on the other, agreed to simply ignore each other, this country could be afar more quiet and peaceful place. At heart, \\"Skipping Towards Gomorrah\\" asks for just that: the freedom to live life as one see fits without having someone else's concept of morality get in the way.	2002-10-16

Chapter 6 on how the sounds of spoken languages are formed is itself worth the price of the book.  Chapter 2 on the grammatic differences between languages is fascinating.  Chapters 4, 5, 7 and 8, which talk about grammar and its role in determining meaning, are well-meaning but become repetitive and obvious.  When talking about Artificial Intelligence he is ill-informed and unaccountably pessimistic about future advances in the field.  In Chapters 3 and 9 he proposes a \\"language instinct\\" and in chapter 10 a \\"grammar gene,\\" but both hew to discredited Chompskian models and don't even try to establish any mechanism.  In chapter 11 he dismisses the whole field of non-human communication in toto, citing such Christian apologists as Herbert Terrace.  Instead he sets up a series of straw men, claiming that because that apes cannot master advanced grammar in human languages (undisputed), somehow this makes their mental processes unworthy of study.  This contradicts his earlier claim, in chapter 3, that mental processes can exist quite independently of grammar and language.  He apparently never even considers that non-human grammar may differ from ours.  Worse, he doesn't even mention non-primate language research!  12 is a vitriolic dismissal of all his critics, and 13 falls into the common trap of describing evolution as \\"wanting to build\\" this or that, a common convention for which he could be excused if this were his only failing.<br />Throughout, Pinker maintains a breezy, readable tone full of pop-culture references - which unfortunately becomes infuriating when it's obvious he doesn't know what he's talking about.	2002-10-13

Dr. Krause -- who is the undisputed best at this -- takes the reader through such steps as choosing appropriate equipment, determining a good locale, protecting equipment from the elements, cataloging your recordings, editing and assembling afterwards, etc.  Using his own mistakes as examples, his advice promises to save beginners countless hours of aggravation.  An illustrative (narrated) CD of soundscape examples accompanies the text.<br /><br />My only complaints would be that he sometimes aims a bit too low -- the glossary defines \\"quiet\\" and \\"mic\\" for crying out loud -- and he automatically assumes that anybody else entering the field will want to duplicate exactly what he's done (which of course would be pretty pointless).  He also apparently doesn't see the inherent contradiction between \\"Nature is an overused and abstract word, intertwined with a tradition that has created an 'it/us' dichotomy that separates us from the very world we try to describe\\" [p.2] and \\"In 1968 it took 15 recording hours to get one hour's worth of natural sound.

In the end I had to conclude it was an attractive but rather poorly thought out book.<br /><br />The idea of 'deep' or 'geological time' is hardly new, but arguing that a 10,000 year view of history is beneficial is simply fatuous.  Brand somehow manages to miss the obvious First Nations concept of stewarding land for future generations rather than owning it, and the Inuit concept of making decisions based on what's best for the seventh generation to follow.  And by doing so he misses the larger lesson contained therein - that such long views are always eclipsed and subsumed by more powerful, shorter views with more immediate returns.<br /><br />Brand is also hampered by recurring (and surprising) technical errors - a supposed 15-year lifespan for optical media, a four-digit date for computer dating, sufficient digital storage for all the information in the world(!), etc.  His \\"Long Now Foundation\\" -- a dodge for attracting short now investors -- envisions a huge mechanical clock built into a mountain somewhere, which completely ignores the lessons of long history that he claims to revere.  We still have a few 10,000 year clocks that our predecessors left us, but having lost the owner's manuals, Stonehenge and the pyramids at Cheops have become all but useless.<br /><br />Documentation is everything - and documentation is ephemeral.  That's why his proposal for a 10,000 year library brought guffaws - daily newspapers?  Books on computer programming?  How long does he think 10,000 years is?  I was reminded of Rudy Rucker's \\"Saucer Wisdom\\" which imagines itself (with a good deal more humor) still popular in the year 4004 - and that's less than halfway there!!!  Ray Kurzweil's \\"The Age of Spiritual Machines\\" is much more mind-boggling, and he had the good taste to look forward only 100 years.<br /><br />John Lennon as usual summed up everything pertinent when he said, \\"Life is what happens to you when you're making other plans.\\"erything pertinent when he said, \\"Life is what happens to you when you're making other plans.\\"	2002-07-17

The project itself sounds pretty wacky, using atomic bombs dropped out the bottom of a spaceship to propel it, but these were the days right after Sputnik (1957-1959) and the U.S. was desperate to get in the space race any way we could.  To everyone's amazement, the assembled team of young, talented Manhattan Project scientists worked out a feasible design, and if it hadn't been for certain political considerations, it might have been built.  But the military didn't want their bombs used for space travel, and a Test Ban Treaty was signed, and anyway people got kinda nervous about exploding lots of A-bombs in the atmosphere.<br />What's interesting about the design is the size of the ship.  Whereas conventional chemical rockets require 1000 tons of propellant for every ton of payload, the Orion was just the opposite.  The bombs would be very compact, and because the nuclear explosions would ablate (wear away) the pusher plate and the ship had to absorb the impacts within livable limits, the ship had to be huge.  A crew of a thousand in a ship the size of an office building was envisioned.  How different our space program would have been if exploring the outer planets were easier than visiting the moon!<br />As with his previous book \\"Darwin Among The Machines,\\" George Dyson writes fluidly, making highly-technical concepts seem almost within grasp (a trait he inherited).  We'll never know, I guess, how close Orion came to being built since most of the work on it is still classified under the Stategic Defense Initiative directed-energy weapons research.	2002-06-04

It's usually hilarious.<br />The late Prof. Gould, by satisfying a request from the Library of Contemporary Thought for a book defending faith, has essentially set himself up as a &quot;Not My Job&quot; contestant.  He's a paleobiologist with no great ministerial training, who admits to agnosticism in the Preamble, and who begins by stating, &quot;I present nothing original in stating the basic thesis...&quot;<br />When writing within his domain he's a powerful voice and a thought-provoking author.  However, when taking on big questions about which he is, at best, an interested amateur, his text resorts to carefully-crafted but ultimately empty arguments full of endless diversions, 200-year old quotations of little relevance, and a lot of flowery words.  There are more words than there are thoughts, actually, if you take my meaning....<br />There's a school of philosophy -- I'm not sure what it's called, maybe you do -- which relies on endless internally-referenced arguments to try to establish a truth by sheer weight of argument.  Unfortunately, without external evidence, such attempts are doomed to convince only the already-faithful.<br />Gould's text falls into this dustbin and, I fear, does disservice to both sides.	2002-05-28

Deborah's journey from cocksure devil-may-care daredevil war photographer, to cautious mother-and-proud-of-it, is an alternately heart-rending and heartwarming tale of personal growth.<br />I don't understand the other reviews which commented negatively on her writing; I found it fluid and biting.  The issues raised by Deborah's story -- including women's roles in society, the press's role in covering tragedy, and the emotional investment that parents owe their children -- are huge and worthwhile.  Her own story is by turns harrowing and amusing, told with ample intelligence and self-deprecation.<br />I loved the book.  Unreservedly.	2002-05-27

Through a series of interviews with his abductees, Desi (and the reader) learn of the lives, loves and fears of this busload of gamblers, and it is their stories, not Desi's, where Butler's humanity and compassion most reveal themselves.<br />But alas, the overriding premise is tough sledding.

The gimmick here is that he has fashioned a dozen stories to explain a dozen tabloid headlines (real or made up?  It doesn't really matter.)  The problem is, with such outrageous premises, the stories do little more than expand on an already-ridiculous idea, and the reader is never fully &quot;vested&quot; in the story.  There are some clever turns, and here-and-there he approaches the tenderness and compassion of his earlier short stories, but on the whole this collection falls flat with a resounding thud.<br />Now that one of the stories (&quot;Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover&quot;) has been expanded into Butler's next novel (&quot;Mr. Spaceman&quot;) I'm revisiting &quot;Tabloid Dreams,&quot; but I'm afraid my opinion of it hasn't mellowed any since I first read it 4 years ago.	2002-05-21

The author has fun throwing unexpected plot twists at you left and right, and the book has a palpable sense of fun.  In fact, it might be compared to Spider Robinson's &quot;Callahan&quot; books in this regard.<br />But in another regard it never really seemed to strive for anything greater.  Although an entertaining bit of fluff, ultimately it was a bit lightweight and inconsequential.  The story developed no internal logic, and the ending was just as airy as the rest.

There is a grandeur, a measured unfolding which wraps you in the characters' lives.

Russo creates a believable near-future, fully fleshed-out with characters who continue on through the rest of the trilogy.  Carlucci is introduced and appears, but he plays only a &quot;second banana&quot; role.  The story in this book sets up the remaining two novels, and if you read one you'll want to read all three of this excellent set.

I haven't been able to add anything substantive to the excellent reviews already here, so have refrained from posting a &quot;me too&quot; review.<br />But there's an angle which perhaps deserves to be mentioned, and that is Russo's use of the &quot;backstory.&quot;  All of his Carlucci novels IMPLY much of what has happened to society without really explaining it, and describe new technologies and fads almost in passing.  The comparisons to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; refer to this fully-created future world of which our story concerns just a small corner.<br />For this reason, I found reading the novels out of order was not really that much of a detriment.  The backstory of &quot;Carlucci's Edge&quot; was largely explained by &quot;Destroying Angel,&quot; and the backstory of &quot;Carlucci's Heart&quot; was explained by &quot;Carlucci's Edge,&quot; but these details are such a small part of this wholly-created new world that your bewilderment quickly settles into a willing suspension of disbelief anyway.<br />So don't be afraid to read them out of order.

The basic premise is that a saucer abductee named Frank Shook tells Rudy the future as it was revealed to him by aliens, but I guess Rudy wasn't counting on any of his previous readers getting ahold of this book, because this future is all-too familiar to us.  By presenting his various ideas for future biotech advances in short vignettes &quot;as told to Frank Shook&quot; Rudy saves himself the trouble of crafting a coherent plotline to contain them.  In fact, one of the entries in Rudy's &quot;Seek!&quot; collection of non-fiction was a &quot;Tech Notes toward a Cyberpunk Novel,&quot; a sort-of shorthand collection of cool ideas he'd like to incorporate into some future novel.<br />&quot;Saucer Wisdom&quot; reads like an expansion of &quot;Tech Notes&quot; -- lots of jumbled ideas (some quite cool, others not) but nothing yet written to place them into the context of a story.  This is not really a novel, not really a book of predictions (like Ray Kurzweil's &quot;The Spiritual Machine&quot;), but more of a notepad of ideas which Rudy has toyed with over the past decade.<br />The book could have had fun with the self-referential aspect of it, but instead took a tone I found a little annoying -- saying several times that this exact book, &quot;Saucer Wisdom,&quot; was to become so influential that it actually creates the future it describes and remains intensely popular into the 40th Century.<br />He wishes.	2001-09-30

His characters and the situations he puts them in ride the knife-edge between absolute believability and (some kind of) science fiction outlandishness, but it's to Lethem's credit that you never lose your attachments to his cast.<br />The twists in this book -- which if you've read it you know about, and if not I couldn't BEGIN to explain them to you -- rank it right up with &quot;Girl&quot; for audacity.

The real reason for reading this book isn't for wallowing in all the sordid details, which are not uncommon in any breakup after an extended relationship.  What I found fascinating was what Catherine left out because she could not see it:<br /> * How indecisive she was; allowing Joel to continue to live with her (and share her bed) long after his affair was in the open<br />  * How insecure, self-centered and manipulative she was<br /> * How abominably they both used their daughters as pawns in their power-plays (with apparently no concern for what it was doing to them)<br /> * How all of Joel's complaints about her -- relayed secondhand by her own text -- played out as really accurate in the end<br /> Not that Joel was guilt-free either.  He shamelessly used his wife and their apartment as a &quot;safe haven&quot; while he was schtupping his editor, waiting for a payday big enough to move out in comfort.

However the stories here, which contrast the Rwandan jungle with his previous life, will make you understand when he says, &quot;I feel much more comfortable and safe when I'm alone in a rainforest or a desert at night than I do when walking around the streets of Manhattan, Los Angeles or Paris in broad daylight, or enduring the pitfalls of academia or the business world.&quot;<br />Bernie is that rare creature, a man of genius and principle.

Russo's Carlucci novels aren't &quot;hard sci-fi,&quot; so I wasn't sure what to expect from this, a 'deep-space saga.'  What it turned out to be, primarily, is Russo working against all expectations of the genre.<br />He breaks several defacto rules, and presents some very unusual twists.  Without giving away too much of the story:<br /> * The narrator is imprisoned for 7 months, and misses everything that happens during his absence<br /> * The main love interest is left unconsummated, and ends in a death<br /> * Several major plot directions just evaporate, halfway developed (just like real life...)<br /> * The ending leaves more questions unanswered than not<br /> Russo's short stories in &quot;Terminal Visions&quot; were highly developed and fully consistent, which makes all the more inexplicable the errors of scale here, a sort of &quot;Star Trek&quot; myopia:<br /> * The Argonos has visited a number of star systems within the lifetime of the narrator, which completely ignores the distances involved<br /> * Although set is a far-distant future of interstellar travel, telephones, video screens and ship controls are present-day<br /> * The population of the ship is &quot;several thousand&quot; which isn't enough for a true breeding colony<br /> * The ship is listed as self-sufficient, but the infrastructure for self-sufficiency isn't evident<br /> * For a ship/colony large enough to be self-sufficient, there are only a handful of characters who figure in the plot<br /> But these concerns didn't really detract from the novel.  Russo's strength, throughout all of his books, is his characterizations and &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; is no exception.  He creates 3-dimensional people you can believe in, and runs them through a storyline that is unpredictable, generates some genuine feelings of dread and uncertainty, and does it with page-turning intensity.<br />Despite breaking all the conventions of the genre -- or perhaps because of it -- this novel is a worthy addition to the pantheon.hy addition to the pantheon.	2001-03-12

Narrower in that, like John Varley's short stories, these are miniature universes unto themselves, sketching out in a few hundred words an entire scenario for a possible future.

It achieves just the right tone  in eulogizing, mourning and seeking after her father -- respectful without  being overweening, comic without being self-conscious, and truthful without  giving the upper hand to either her father's talent or his problems.  I'm  sure her father would have loved the book -- but then it would be a  different book if he'd lived, wouldn't it?<br />There are a fair number of  poetic images worthy of a Brautigan -- the rain becomes Richard's tears, a  typewriter is left unplugged to keep her father from temptation, her  father's ashes remain unburied for reasons you'll have to read about -- but  there are also stretches of Ianthe's unique voice, her level-headedness and  practicality -- traits which seem to have skipped her father's  generation.<br />There are many chapters so quotable I've already sent them to  my writer-friends.

Oh, the drug charges and trial were obvious  government falsehoods, and John easily demolishes the evidence against him.  Recounting the travesty trial takes over half the book, even though  &quot;Dream Maker&quot; stops before the trial begins.<br />What was more  interesting is his recounting of his life before the trial, and his very,  very brief touching on the failure of DeLorean Motor Company.  In these he  reveals himself to be very vain, mean-spirited, self-centered and willing  to blame everyone but himself.  It is not pretty reading his cruel and  tactless dismissals of his ex-wifes or business partners.<br />He starts the  acknowledgements by saying that writing this book was good therapy.  &quot;In the beginning, [co-author] Ted [Schwarz] knew that I was bitter,  angry and hostile.  But as he and I talked through 1,200 pages of  transcript, I slowly healed and developed a more balanced view, just as Ted  knew I would.&quot;<br />Well, a few more months of healing would have been  beneficial, because this book blames everybody for the downfall of JZD and  DMC except the one person who, clearly, was to blame.<br />John's conversion  to born-again Christianity, which dominates the last half of the book, is  just another case of seeking to escape responsibility.  Everything is  &quot;God's will.&quot;<br />In all, a fascinating glimpse into a slimy world  of high stakes, high finance and huge egos.	2000-08-05

DeLorean	Books	4	17	19	N	Y	Exhaustive But Biased	This story of the rise and fall of DeLorean Motor Company is exhaustively researched and fabulously detailed, but the authors make no attempt to hide their loathing for the man.  From the Prologue onward, snide jabs (such as  &quot;The DeLorean story warns us to be more cautious and reluctant to  entrust our dreams to others&quot;) pepper the narrative.<br />Personally, I  would have preferred the facts speak for themselves.  JZD was (and remains)  a complex character whose story is considerably more multi-faceted than  Fallon/Srodes allow for.  You can see it physically pains the authors when  they have to admit John's fidelity, sobriety and work ethic.  A less-biased  accounting would have allowed the reader to form his or her own opinion,  and there's plenty of material to support any range of opinion.<br />But the  book is readable and fairly well organized (except for the occasional  sudden appearance of important people or events that we are told figured  prominently earlier on) and, as mentioned, seems to be well-researched.  I  give it four stars for effort, none for attitude.	2000-07-13

No, I just barely  got any d&eacute;ja vu from it...  But I enjoyed it even more the second(?)  time.<br />Young's story is a brisk, short-chaptered cautionary tale,  well-paced and intriguing.  There are some major plot elements left  unexplained -- like how can the Hammerheads be swimming in the ocean at one  point, and rampaging through the streets of New York in another -- do they  have fins or legs? -- but as long as you're willing to suspend your  disbelief, this is great &quot;soft&quot; science-fiction.<br />The  microcoding fashions reminded me a bit of Delaney's &quot;Dahlgren,&quot;  and the high-tech high-security future is very Bladerunner.  However  Young's vision of genetic tinkering gone awry is all his own, as far as I  know.  Proponents of &quot;designer genes&quot; and  nanotechnology-as-mankind's-golden-goose would do well to consider Young's  alternative future, where not everyone follows a Disney script.<br />Chilling  and (except for a few implausible details) entirely too plausible.	2000-06-22

This book by Joe Coomer is a lot better than &quot;Apologizing to Dogs&quot; but not as good as &quot;The Loop.&quot;  As the chronicle of the lives of three very different women, it usually presents a sympathetic  portrait but serves up no lasting insights.  It is entertainment, first and  last.<br />The final odyssey, where the women go in search of Prince Edward  Island, could have taken on mythic proportions but instead passes as a  lark, as whimsical as the novel's title.  Which reminds me, although the  title occurs in the text (during a paragraph of rare poetic writing) what  the hell does it have to do with the story?  Nothing, as far as I can  tell.<br />Finally the narrator's secret, boiling up like a repressed memory  at the end of the tale, isn't nearly as monumental as Coomer plays it -- as  a denouement it falls a bit flat.  But nevermind, the storyline up to that  point and the sympathetic writing make this a pleasing read on balance.<br />We should ask no more.	2000-06-15

Cheney's bio, however, makes a valiant attempt.<br />Her material is poorly organized.  She jumps back and forth in time, from the young Tesla to the old Tesla,  with no warning or pattern.  She jumps around in subjects almost as  willfully.  Her treatment of Tesla is reverent and laudatory one minute,  dismissive and belittling the next.<br />She gives almost no firm dates, so I  found myself often bewildered about exactly which Tesla was being  discussed.  Her description of Tesla's science makes it clear that she was  no scientist herself, and in fact makes Tesla's accomplishments all the  harder to decipher.  And most damning of all, she alludes to Tesla's odd  habits and personal quirks, but never once comes right out and describes  them.<br />Tesla's story makes for a fascinating biography, but Cheney's may  not be it.	2000-05-19

The story takes a back seat  to the writing here, in a very mannered, gimmicky and ultimately tedious  exposition.  It tries so hard to be &quot;quirky&quot; that the unfortunate  loser is the story.  It reads like a class project, or a community college  creative writing assignment (and that isn't good).<br />Coomer is capable of  better.

However the book manages to explore these issues without  preaching, and in the end leaves it to the reader to decide what is  important.<br />The book only rated four stars with me for a couple reasons:  one, the characters are an odd mix of cluelessness and wisdom.  At times I  found glaringly out-of-character wisdom and philosophy coming out of their  mouths.  Two, the book reminded me of &quot;The Shipping News&quot; in that  the main characters seem so lost, so unaware, so lacking in goals and  direction that at times I wanted to slap them.<br />But it was an enjoyable  ride with memorable characterizations, and I look forward to reading some  of Coomer's other interesting-sounding titles.	2000-03-30

It seems to  have been written as much to get it out of Quammen's system as for any  imagined reader.<br />You marvel at the remote corners of the world Quammen  visits, and the hardships of getting there.  You marvel at the quiet  determination with which the unsung field researchers toil away.  You  marvel at the slow realization among ecologists that &quot;reserves&quot;  aren't sufficient to maintain biodiversity over several lifetimes.  You  bristle at the loss, irretrievably, of unspoiled places through either the  bald encroachment of man or, more galling, the benign paternalism of  &quot;wildlife managers.&quot;  In particular, Quammen reveals the  devastating legacy of Christian missionaries who brought their lifestyles  (and livestock) with them.<br />In short, &quot;Dodo&quot; is about four books  all rolled into one, which makes it a heady undertaking for the reader OR  author.  Quammen does a pretty good job of organizing his data into a  readable narrative, but it may have been more powerful as four separate  books, I don't know.  Frankly, the chatty endlessly-detailed &quot;A la  recherche du temps perdu &quot;-style wore on me after a while, and I read  a dozen other books while slogging through this one.<br />However, along with  &quot;The Beak of the Finch&quot; by Jonathan Weiner, Quammen has performed  a valuable service by summarizing current thought in the &quot;new  synthesis&quot; of evolution.  Reading both books gives the lay reader,  such as myself, a new appreciation for the delicacy and complexity of life  on earth.	2000-01-10

It reveals how some of the superstars of the ape language experiments of the '70s, as well as several lesser-known primate research subjects, were  callously discarded after the funding (and subsequently interest) dried up.  With a few happy exceptions, their lives are now miserable -- or  over.<br />It's as bad as the chimps from the space program, who after years  of careful training were sold to laboratories for medical experiments.  Most of Linden's subjects -- after being reared in human company and taught  to use sign language or symbol-boards -- were sold to laboratories, placed  in zoos, or attempted to return to the wild (with disasterous  results).<br />The image of a despondent gorilla in a dank concrete zoo cage,  signing desperately to passers-by &quot;get me out, get me out!&quot; will  haunt me forever.	2000-01-09

Having read three of Linden's previous works -- Apes, Men and Language; Silent Partners (excellent!); and The Education of Koko -- I was  immediately intrigued.<br />However, having just finished it I must say it was  a bit lighter than I expected.  As Linden states in the Preface, this is a  book of &quot;anecdotes&quot; about animal intelligence, not any serious  scientific study of same.  And he seems to draw no deeper conclusion from  the various, and hugely entertaining tales than to marvel at them and say,  in effect, &quot;Gee, isn't that neat.&quot;<br />There's also a predictable  save-the-environment undertone which, while heartfelt, pushes the book  further into maudlin territory.  Overall then, an entertaining single-day  read of no greater import than filling a day with mirth.<br />Which, come to  think of it, isn't so bad.	2000-01-09

I bought a remaindered copy for $4 at Half-Price Books, but after reading it I realized I didn't get much of a bargain.<br />Doug starts out by praising  himself for being in total control of this book -- typesetting, page  design, content, direction...  Well, he shouldn't be so smug.  The  typography is a jumbled mess, the chapter introductions are amateurish, the  page breaks are artificial and distracting, the content wanders off the  subject into numerous, endless (and pointless) digressions, and most of the  30,000 versions of the poem he translates are laughably bad.<br />There's a  worthwhile message in here somewhere, buried under six tons of authorial  effluvia -- something about the art of translation being a balance between  form and content.  But of the 632 pages here, only about 120 serve this  purpose.  Hofstadter has apparently become such a powerhouse author that he  is allowed to wield total control, but it's a two edged sword and he proves  himself no Galahad.<br />Doug man, you need an editor.	1999-06-28

I gave it three stars because of its powerful effect -- not because I  enjoyed it.  In truth, it was absolutely horrifying.<br />The premise is that  in the near future mankind has figured out how to re-animate the dead,  making them just smart enough to provide slave labor but not activating the  higher mental functions that would allow them to become autonomous.  The  world's economy has been profoundly changed (toward personal gain for a  very few, and economic ruin for everybody else) by this source of unlimited  free manpower.<br />The story centers around one person whose memory does not  get completely wiped, and begins to remember bits and pieces of his former  life.

Did not The Bible state that  everything was created all-at-once in perfect harmony?  How then could an  obviously human skeleton -- but equally obviously not that of a modern  Englishman -- have come to rest in the soil beneath their feet?<br />The  ripples from these discoveries were to penetrate the farthest reaches of  scientific endeavor, as man began to comprehend geologic time (as opposed  to the Biblical timeframe), repeated mass extinctions (as opposed to  Christian creation myths) and mankind's own humble origins, starkly laid  out on the table before them.<br />With the help of a certain Mr. Charles A.  Darwin, whose own ideas on the mutability of species he had been harboring  privately for 20 years, science was soon to face a new conception of  itself, basing theory on evidence and logic rather than religious texts and  teachings.  It is a revolution which is still very much on-going  today.<br />The authors are to be commended for making a potentially dry and  technical subject come alive, with the intrigues, power struggles, vanity,  hubris and anguish of the revolution ably depicted.	1999-04-15

The point that computers encourage non-linear exploration is  well-founded (just ask anyone who has lost a day on the internet) and  designers of kids software should pay heed, since they often treat the  computer as just another linear information-delivery vehicle.  But Papert's  book here is itself rather long on repetition and short on insight, much  like the software Papert decries.<br />Several stories from Papert's own  family and friends are used to illustrate his basic theme.

As it turns out, there are more questions than answers.<br />However, in amongst all the discussion of immortality I wish he  had devoted a chapter to the wisdom of such a quest.  He mentions in  passing the ants and bees who each perform a distinct function and,  separated from their hive or nest, expire rather quickly.  Medina repeats  the oft-quoted maxim that they are more like a single organism with  independently-functioning cells than like distinct individuals.<br />I wish he  had extended this analogy to mankind, and showed how immortality would be  to the detriment of long-term species survival in a changing environment.  &quot;Descent with modifications&quot; relies on continual refreshing of  the genetic material.  Lewis Thomas and Stephen Jay Gould (and even Richard  Dawkins) have put forward the idea that the individual is not the prime  target of evolution, and I think this paradigm shift helps explain the  causes of, and need for, aging.	1999-04-08

After the first couple chapters nothing new is  presented, just more and more (and more!) of the same.<br />His focus is  almost exclusively Freudian, postulating a complete, functioning  &quot;undermind&quot; which is inaccessible (or at least veiled) to  consciousness.  He utilizes many fascinating examples to bring together  Einstein's ruminations, Heidegger's meditations, Coleridge's unconscious  plagiarism, and literally hundreds more into a more-or-less coherent  argument for 'unconscious knowing.'  The fact that he lumps both 'flash  insight' and 'extended contemplation' into the same category seems a bit  strained, but after 200+ pages of wide-ranging testimony one is  hard-pressed to reply.<br />His is a fascinating topic, touching many  important areas (like the value of experiential learning over book  learning) and the first couple chapters are real eye-openers.

He starts with an  outdated summary of creation physics, then contrasts the slowing timeline  of phase changes in the universe with the speeding up of the evolution of  life -- as if the two are somehow related.  He puts forth the curious idea  that technology is &quot;inevitable&quot; wherever life evolves.  Both  these arguments exemplify the homocentric hubris that the universe was  created for the emergence of mankind.<br />Nevermind.  Skip the first chapter  (as Kurzweil himself suggests in the prefatory note) and you'll quickly get  into the good stuff.  His chapters on the evolution of intelligence and the  growth of computing power are well founded.<br />Where he really hits his  stride however is in the second section, &quot;Preparing the Present,&quot;  where he puts forth cogent arguments for quantum computing based on DNA,  mentality-enhancing neural implants, and &quot;downloading your mind to  your personal computer.&quot;  He then goes on to discuss nanotechnology  and life-extending technologies.  This section alone is worth the price of  the book.<br />After the past and the present, he gives quick snapshots of  where he thinks we may be in 10, 20, 30, and 100 years.  These too are well  thought out and insightful.  He is generally conservative, foreseeing no  large &quot;phase changes&quot; which could radically affect current  trends.  It'll be interesting to check back to see how his predictions held  up.<br />Other pluses: an excellent &quot;further reading&quot; list,  extensive web links, and far-ranging footnotes.<br />Minuses: he takes Roger  Penrose seriously, he fails to mention Racter in the discussion of computer  authors, and he spends just a wee bit too much time tooting his own horn  (Kurzweil Computer Products, Kurzweil Reading Machine, Kurzweil Data Entry  Machine, Kurzweil Music Systems, Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, Kurzweil  Education Systems, Ray Kurzweil Cybernetic Poet...)  But to be fair, he HAS  pioneered in all these areas, so perhaps he has earned his  immodesty.<br />Overall, a fascinating, thought-provoking book which is not  afraid to make concrete predictions.

The &quot;first book written by a computer&quot; won't win any awards for insight or style, but it certainly will make you smile.<br />Racter seems to have a predilection for lettuce, and for using a plethora of florid  adjectives.  Some of the jumps in logic (or are they disconnected ideas  jammed together?) will have you scratching your head.  His poetry is  startling and full of gunshots of imagination.  But don't blame him -- it's  the way he was programmed.<br />Even so, Racter may make more sense than  &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;....<br />Computer-authored books and  computer-composed music are in their infancy, but you can be sure there  will be more (and better) to come.	1999-01-12

I picked this book up because he seemed to be a character out of the Feynman mold -- eccentric brilliant scientist has comic adventures and pokes fun at the science establishment.<br />It starts out as just that.  Unfortunately, about halfway through, be begins to wander from the trail of  science into some uncharted territories which he claims are equally worthy  of study: astrology, astral plains, telepathy, control of the weather....  HIV does not cause AIDS....<br />He destroys whatever credibility he had by  failing to be critical when it serves him not to be.  So yes, it's an  entertaining read, he's a cocky and petulant iconclast who sounds like he'd  be a lot of fun at a party.<br />Just don't take everything he says as gospel.  His whole schtick is that people shouldn't take anything at face value --  which must include his book!	1999-01-08

The unsurpassed  richness of Sign -- and the thought patterns supported by it -- will cause  many a &quot;deafness-impaired&quot; hearing person to give consideration  to this view.<br />As always, Oliver is erudite, compassionate, witty and  insightful.

However, as Alperovitz makes  clear, there were several viable options to ending the Pacific War that  were both more humane and likely to succeed.<br />1. Demonstrate the Atom Bomb  on an uninhabited atoll, as recommended in the Franck Report by a committee  of scientists working on the Project<br />2. Make a small concession to  Japanese pride/saving face and allow the Emperor to retain his throne in a  total, but conditional, surrender (which they had already proposed)<br />3.  Allow a few extra days for Japan to react to the entry of the Soviets into  the war.  It is now known that overtures to a settlement had been relayed  to the British Foreign Minister.<br />Any one of these options would be more  likely to succeed than a full-fledged armed invasion of the home islands,  which had been proposed as a military disinformation but wasn't being  seriously considered.  As such, it backfired horribly by strengthening  Japanese resolve.<br />Instead, the hawks and, for lack of a better term,  &quot;military-minded&quot; advisors to new president Truman recommended a  full use of the weapon. As a result, the United States is still the only  nation on earth to have used Atomic weapons in war -- twice -- and against  unarmed civilians.  Not a very proud legacy.<br />Their reasoning, with the  hindsight of fifty years, now seems sadly small-minded:<br />1. To justify  the expenditure of $2 billion on a weapon originally designed in  competition with the now-defeated Germany<br />2. To intimidate the Soviets  into accepting American hegemony.<br />Experience bore out the Franck Report's  prediction that the second goal was unattainable, and its further  prediction that a ruinous nuclear arms race would result.  The  recommendations and predictions of some of the world's smartest people were  thrown out by military advisors (specifically James Byrnes, who refused to  even share the report with Truman), considering himself better equipped to  understand human nature and thus shape history for all of  mankind.<br />Whether &quot;revisionist&quot; or second-guessing, Alperovitz  makes a compelling case for better options dismissed, and the tragic legacy  of military hubris.en share the report with Truman), considering himself better equipped to  understand human nature and thus shape history for all of  mankind.<br />Whether &quot;revisionist&quot; or second-guessing, Alperovitz  makes a compelling case for better options dismissed, and the tragic legacy  of military hubris.	1998-09-28

His latest is no exception.<br />&quot;Are We Unique?&quot; starts with a preface which states the author's bias in an unusually revealing manner.  After experiencing a computer &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; program designed to find patterns, Trefil was unnerved by the result: &quot;I was listening to the words of an intelligence that was totally alien.&quot;  On leaving the AI lab, Trefil makes a big point of the fact that he crossed himself.<br />This, in a nutshell, is the book's problem.  Trefil's twin thrusts are: 1. If it is &quot;alien&quot; it cannot be human, and if it is not human it cannot be intelligence, and; 2. Christianity (although never mentioned by name) underscores all claims to human uniqueness.<br />Trefil uses classic obfuscationist techniques such as bait-and-switch and &quot;everybody-knows&quot; dismiss! als to completely misrepresent the issues.  On the subject of cetacean intelligence, Trefil dismisses the entire field with a breezy (and undocumented) &quot;scientists no longer accept the notion that dolphins are in some way more intelligent than other animals.&quot;  On the subject of the ape language experiments, Trefil again dismisses the entire field out-of-hand: &quot;The consensus among scientists these days seems to be that those early claims for language abilities in great apes cannot be substantiated.&quot;  (Needless to say, the *scientists* involved in these studies would probably be surprised to hear of this!)  When it comes to computer Artificial Intelligence, Trefil is reduced to saying, &quot;We can't really make progress in our quest for human uniqueness unless we dispose of this particular canard [that the brain is just a computer].&quot;<br />In other words, the book is not an investigation of whether human intelligence is unique, but a &quot;quest&quot; to ! prove it is so -- against mounting evidence to the contrary! .<br />And why?  Because Trefil's Christian beliefs make him unable or unwilling to accept that other &quot;alien&quot; intelligences do (or soon will) exist.  He clings to his &quot;uniqueness&quot; with all of the desperation of the truly scared.<br />He SHOULD cross himself.is so -- against mounting evidence to the contrary! .<br />And why?

She learned to eat with silverware, dress herself, read magazines, sit in a chair, drink wine, and eventually she learned some ASL from Roger Fouts.<br />Some other things she did not learn: toilet training, temper management, appropriate behavior around strangers....  Though raised as a human, many of her behaviors were still &quot;wild animal.&quot;<br />The Temerlins were either unbelievably tolerant or incredibly undisciplined (depending on your viewpoint).  They allowed Lucy to run roughshod over their lives, destroy their home and frighten their guests.  Maurice is a psychotherapist and his book is filled with elaborate rationalizations and psycho-babble to avoid facing this truth.  It is sometimes unintentionally hilarious as Temerlin explains his guests psychological failings because they are horrified at having a chimp defecate in their lap.<br />Unfortunately, the book ends in 1975.  After this time, according ! to Roger Fouts's 1997 &quot;Next of Kin,&quot; Lucy was sent to Africa to be &quot;re-integrated&quot; into the wild she had never known.  After several years of extreme hardship and adjustment difficulties, she was eventually shot and killed by a hunter, who took her hide, hands and feet as trophies.<br />But that would make another book.	1998-08-05

With a straight face he is able to make such statements as &quot;[Muzak] makes us feel more relaxed, contemplative, distracted from problems, and prone to whistle over chores we might find unbearable if forced to suffer them in silence.&quot;  He then goes on to provide short hagiographies of Mantovani, Ray Conniff, Andre Kostelanetz, Bert Kaempfert and a host of other &quot;schlock-jocks.&quot;<br />Never once is the campiness or artlessness of the &quot;massed-strings&quot; approach discussed.  Lanza mentions in passing once or twice that &quot;background music&quot; appeals to &quot;the masses&quot; but never states the obvious next qualifier, &quot;who don't like or know anything about music.&quot;<br />The book is morbidly fascinating, watching the author extoll the virtues of this style of music, totally without irony or tongue-in-cheek. If the author isn't an employee of Muzak he must at least have been commissioned by them.  The gag-reflex asserts itself frequently and without warning.<br />Be afraid.  Be very afraid.	1998-06-23

I read both books, one after the other, and the contrast was startling.<br /> Whereas Negroponte (&quot;Being Digital&quot;) writes and thinks 20-30 years in the future, Dyson is plodding along in a plebian present, unaware of a good deal of the reality around her.  Whereas Negroponte tells us what we might expect with many startlingly-original speculations, Dyson seems intent on explaining the present at a fifth-grade level - and her analysis is often so far off-base it's amusing.<br /> She spends a good deal of the book telling us how smart and special she is, being the spawn of two world-class scientists.  She prattles on about her investments, her apartment, her desk, her travels - as if we care.  In fact, her brother's book (&quot;Darwin Among The Machines,&quot; George Dyson, 1997) is 100 times more insightful without all the puffery.  Of course everything her father Freeman has written is as modest and intelligent as she is self-important and dull.<br /> I kept getting the feeling, as I was laboring through her assembled platitudes, that she was jealous of her brother's and her father's authorial successes, and decided &quot;to write a book herself.&quot;  Trouble is, she doesn't have anything to say - and it shows.	1998-04-13

Behe waits 192 pages to advance HIS theory, and when he does it is: &quot;Inferring that biochemical systems were designed by an intelligent agent is humdrum process that requires no new principles of logic or science.&quot;  Excuse me?  What universe does he come from that miracles are &quot;humdrum processes that require no new principles&quot;?<br />  Behe's obviously had some biochemical training, but he's no scientist.  The analogies he uses in the book are to such things as Calvin and Hobbes cartoons, TV movies, fictional detectives and Rube Goldberg cartoons.  If he spent a little more time studying scientific research and a little less time reading his bible, he might have come up with a worthwhile book on the weaknesses of Darwinism.  As it is, he simply takes the standard discredited Creationist dogma and drives it down a layer, from gross anatomy to biochemical processes.<br />  Don't waste your time reading it.	1998-03-14

By the end of the book the characters are older, more mature, more confident, and you have come to care about China Mountain very deeply.
