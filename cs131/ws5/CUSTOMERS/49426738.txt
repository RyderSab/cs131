Her writing is wonderful in a way that doesn't make you feel guilty for reading some random chick lit. Her books are beyond the ramblings of a lost and confused 20something, but she makes it seem possible to be young, beautiful, and successful. A Clean Slate is no different. It is extremely well-written with a touch of mystery that makes you keep reading til the last page. I stayed up late on a work night to finish this. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it didn't quite turn out the way I expected and hoped. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to read some quality chick lit.	2004-05-24

But the summary I read of this book was enough to catch my attention, and I'm glad it did. I went around searching for this book last week when it came out, and ended up finding it at an airport of all places. So I got it for my plane ride and ended up staying up that night finishing it. It's a cute story, even though the characters aren't as fleshed out as they could have been. The whole reasoning behind the &quot;it's not you, it's me&quot; thing was a bit hard to believe, but you end up falling in love with Jas anyhow. My only comment is that we're led to believe that Jas is this huge rock star now (in the description anyway), but he is anything but. I would have enjoyed reading more about his &quot;glamourous&quot; life, and it would have added another layer to the characters. But, all in all, a very quick and satisfying read.	2004-05-13

Being a young Chinese-American woman living in California, I was immediately drawn to this story, and there were many things mentioned that were easily related to and could have been straight out of my own life story. But there were also many other instances in the book that I found a bit offensive. The main character is, more or less, in denial of her heritage, at least at the beginning, and I found it hypocritical of her to stereotype her so-called &quot;hoarders&quot; when, in fact, she herself failed to understand her own culture. Like her, I am pretty Americanized, but reading this book makes me hope that I will not end up like her one day. She is less than representative of today's &quot;typical&quot; chinese-american young woman, and I hope that non-asian readers will realize that. Other reviewers have mentioned Amy Tan, and I can honestly say that The Joy Luck Club is more representative of asian-american life, at least I think so. (It was pretty cool to hear &quot;hecka&quot; mentioned in the book though :) yay norcal!)	2004-05-13

But I soon learned that it was more than the settings that I was impressed with. This book is unlike any other chick-lit novel. Any girl can easily identify with Casey, who is trying to find herself in the world. This became a story, not merely about female bonding, but about self-reflection and self-discovery, things that I'm sure any other young woman in her 20s can easily relate to. I found so many similarities between myself and Casey, that I'm confident that others will also.	2003-09-08

The style of writing was extremely hard to understand, and I had an easier time reading one of my economics textbooks than trying to read this. Not many books can give you a headache after trying to decipher a single page...and not succeeding. I even tried flipping through to see if the story got better, but it didn't at all. Aside from the writing style, the main character wasn't someone you *wanted* to read about. She just wasn't likable at all. I couldn't even finish one chapter before wanting to hurl it into the nearest trashcan, and that's saying a lot, considering I read pretty much everything. You're better off reading *Milkrun* or *Burning the Map* anything but this book.	2003-08-30

I loved Milkrun and laughed out loud numerous times throughout the book. But with this one, I seldom even emitted one of Allie's annoying giggles. Standing alone, this book isn't horrible. I guess I was just spoiled, having read Milkrun first and expected more. One thing that confused me was how Allie seemed to change in the various chapters, depending on the narrator. When it was her telling the story, she seemed like a normal 22 year old. But when her roommates were the speakers, she became this annoying idiot who acted like a child at times. Also, it was a bit annoying to see Allie portrayed as the virgin of the group. Because of that, of course she's naive, doesn't know how to approach men, has no life, no will of her own....I mean, come on. Is she really that big of a push-over. And is she really that stupid? I guess the only consolation is that it does in fact get better at the end.	2003-08-09

Personally, I prefer this over Bridget Jones, which I found completely boring and hard to read. I picked up this book after not being able to continue with \\"Love: A User's Guide,\\" and I'm glad that this was the alternate I came up with. Being in my 20s myself, it is so easy to relate to. And I love the author's style of writing. It's extremely easy to read and kept me entertained to the end. Sure, Jackie wasn't deep or exactly how I'd want to end up in another 5 years or so, but she was great to read about. The stream of consciousness writing was what I found interesting and made me laugh out loud, (ie. Jackie's encounters w/ Sex-God-Lorenzo). It's pretty predictable, but really sweet. The ending was fine, but could have been fleshed out a bit more. All in all, a great summer read. I finished it in 2 days while lying on the beach.	2003-07-12

I don't understand. The hero and heroine are great, they have great chemistry, the plot is interesting...but somehow, she blew it. I really did like the characters at the beginning. I loved their teasing and bantering, and I loved Geoffrey's protectiveness over Elizabeth. But afterwards, she just seemed to submit to him and lost all of her independence. She lets him yell at her til her ears are ringing, and just forgets the fact that he locked her in their room for days. And don't get me started on HIM. You know how most stubborn, stupid men learn to be more considerate and caring in romance novels? Well, I don't think he got the memo. Furthermore, the &quot;mystery&quot; was competely predictable. I mean, I knew who the culprit was before I was halfway through the book. And the drama at the end just kind of dissolved into nothing, like JG was in a hurry to end the book. If you want a piece of light reading, then by all means, go for it. But it doesn't even compare to &quot;Ransom,&quot; which I absolutely adore and is my all-time favorite of JG bookds.	2003-04-22

I really liked the princess, and I found Colin to be very charming, if stubborn. However, the mystery part of it seemed forced, especially at the end. And the relationship between Colin and Alessandra could have been developed further. I just really didn't like how Alessandra never really stands up to Colin, despite the ways that he treats her at times. She would be thinking to herself that she's completely angry at him, but whenever she opened her mouth, it seemed like nothing had happened and everything was fine, even after a life-threatening experience. One part I thought could have been dealt with more was before their wedding, with Colin's hair. I thought for sure that she was going to give him a piece of her mind...but of course not. I kept waiting for something completely dramatic to happen, but the story remained flat throughout. There was so many instances where issues could have been addressed with more: Colin's hair, Catherine &amp; Alessandra's necklace switch, Alessandra's house arrest that just ended with no mention...etc, etc. My point is, this book had tons of potential to become a great story rather than just being so-so.	2003-04-11

Ms. McNaught could have easily made Nicki's story into another one of her amazing historicals. On the other hand, &quot;Double Exposure&quot; with Corey Foster was a great little prequel to Remember When. Spence was a wonderful counterpart to Corey, and I enjoyed reading their story immensely. My favorite over all was &quot;Just Curious.&quot; I loved Mac, and Karen was a great foil to him. Their story was completely adorable and sweet and ended way too soon for my liking.	2002-06-04

Their's could have easily been made into a book of their own. This was my one and only complaint, but I guess it's a pretty big one. Brodick and Gillian's story was wonderful to read, but Ramsey and Bridgid's was what I remembered most and what made me go searching for this book again. They were incredibly adorable and sweet, and I loved reading the few interactions they had. I only hope that Ms. Garwood will decide to write another sequel featuring Ramsey and Bridgid. Their's is a story I would truly enjoy reading.	2002-05-21

Roberts should work on developing her characters more and giving each one their own personality. Major characters were developed as much as minor characters were. It would make distinguishing each character much easier. Tucker and Caroline were basically molds that weren't filled up with nearly enough emotion, personality or character traits. Furthermore, Roberts doesn't develop the plots and twists in this novel as well as she does in her others. Caroline's parents were mentioned in bits and pieces, and with the influence they had in her career, one would think that her parents would play a bigger role in the novel. However, it is as if they don't exist after the first introduction of them. Also, her career is not mentioned at all regardless of its impact on her life prior to the time of this story. As for Tucker, there's nothing even hinting at his feelings beyond lust towards Caroline. We never see that transition from lust to &quot;something more.&quot; Overall, you'd be much better off reading another of Roberts' novels, like *Montana sky*.	2001-08-16

For the past year or two my little sister had been trying to get me to read her Harry Potter books, but I never did. Finally she mailed the first one to me and made me promise to read it. I finally got to it a few weeks ago, and I couldn't put it down the whole night! I had to borrow the next books from my friend and finished all of them within a week and a half, (not a smart thing considering this was during finals week). But needless to say, since then, I have become yet another Harry Potter fan and I've promised my sister I'd take her when the movie comes out :) Harry Potter is a wonderful series, and the first book is my favorite one. Honestly, I didn't think I'd enjoy them, but they remind me of elementary school when we read all those Roald Dahl books. J.K. Rowling recreates the magic of *Matilda* and *The BFG* in an amazing way. I can't wait til the 5th book comes out!! (hurry up!!!)

You don't really get to know any of the characters. Garwood uses a lot of words, but there is very little detail. Because of this, the novel proceeds extremely slowly. It goes a while into the story until the heroine, Laurant, finally appears. She is presented as being the typical female who has gotten used to hiding her feelings, but in this book she does it all too well. She shows very little emotion, even though she is the target of a madman, which results in this being very unbelievable. You're led to believe that Laurant is a strong, independent woman, but despite the many times that she says, &quot;come and get me! i'm not scared!&quot; she's extremely weak. She goes thru the entire book almost in a daze. Her house is burning down and she stops to pack!!!! She is just completely unbelievable as a woman in danger who is supposedly fighting back. As for Nick, at least you get a little bit of personality in him, not much, but more than Laurant. It was as if Garwood handed you the characters and expected you to fill them in. There was absolutely no connection between Nick and Laurant, no chemistry whatsoever. And I just had a hard time buying their &quot;relationship.&quot; I find it hard to believe there was even like or lust involved. It was like, miraculously they decided they were right for each other! Where did that come from?? Anyways, Noah was cute. He was more entertaining than any of the main characters. But the novel moved way to slowly for a mystery novel and I found myself skipping over the pages to get to some action. At the end, I still had trouble figuring out who the &quot;heartbreaker&quot; was exactly.	2001-03-07

So it floated around our apartment for a while and two more of us read it. However, the 2 of us have come to an agreement that she must have been crazy when she said this was a good book. This book was completely unrealistic, confusing, boring, and had absolutely the worst characters ever. I especially didn't like the story being told from 2 different POV's. Both Eden and Taylor sounded identical in Coulter's attempt to give another dimension to the story. My biggest problem was that Taylor was BORING!! He's supposed to be the man who eventually earns Eden's trust?? If I were her, I'd run away. He's insensitive and uncompassionate and not even likeable. It's my understanding that you're actually supposed to like the hero in romance novels and actually want the heroine to get together with him at the end. This was not the case at all. And i loved how Taylor knew that Eden was terrified of men, and the first thing he does is strip down naked and get into bed with her. What a way to be sensitive. I couldn't believe this book! I hated how it jumped back and forth between characters and times. That was completely unnecessary and could have been told better if it just ran straight from beginning to end with one narrator.  Coulter's attempt at creativity just resulted in a lot of headache and confusion. The story was incredibly slow and at the end, it seemed like there was a rush to finish, which resulted in not a particularly well-written ending. And I shouldnt even start with Eden. She was much to cynical, and she was abused over and over and over again-we get the picture.  None of the characters had any depth to them and could not be related to in any way. Also the &quot;bad guy&quot; was some random person, like Coulter tried to add a twist at the end but failed miserably. Mysteries are supposed to allow you to figure out who the antagonist is, but that can't be donein this book b/c he only makes a cameo appearance once or twice at the beginning. True, I couldnt' put the book down, but it was just so that I could see if there was some redeeming quality at the end; there wasn't.	2001-02-25

I just had to read *Remember When* again after having it sit on my shelf for a while. This is honestly the best McNaught book I have read and one of the few books I can read over and over again and love it even more afterwards. There is none of the heartache found in other McNaught books, just simple, unquestioning love between Diana and Cole. It leaves you smiling throughout the story, especially in the first few chapters, and then sigh with contentment at the end :) *Remember When* is a simple, yet satisfying, romance novel with none of the stupid misunderstandings other couples find in such books as *Whitney, My Love* and *Almost Heaven*. Which means, the hero or heroine isn't dumb enough to ruin what he or she has. Diana and Cole aren't just a typical couple thrown together by lust; they actually LIKE each other, something lacking in most other romance novels. Cole is a wonderful hero, and Diana the perfect match for him :)	2000-12-30

But I have to admit, I was just a little bit disapointed. It was a very light and quick read, even if it was a bit unrealistic. I honestly doubt people spoke like Nathan and Sara did, during that time period. The story could have taken place last week in San Francisco! Although it was a historical, it didn't &quot;transport&quot; me to the time and place of the characters. However, like I said, this was a very entertaining story. Sara's faith in her husband was admirable, though she was a bit weak. Even she noticed that Nathan only had to crook a finger and she'd come running!! Sara was a bit of a ditz, if you ask me but she was a riot! I couldn't stop laughing over her mishaps, and they made me want her to succeed that much more. Nathan was a very good hero, his protectiveness over Sara was what won me over. Don't we all want a man like Nathan who'll try to keep us safe from all the harm in the world. I was a bit disappointed with how it played out in the end though. Nathan was hilarious when he was asking Caine for advice on how to woo his wife back! :) But, like Caine, I was also looking forward to seeing Nathan &quot;getting down on his knees&quot; before Sara would forgive him. She was much too forgiving, but I'm glad to see her gaining some strength at the end. Nathan and Sara together were so cute. I loved their shouting matches! They really were meant to be together...they're probably the only ones who'd be able to stand each other :)	2000-12-27

She was rude, arrogant, annoying, uptight, and not even close to being a good heroine. She acted this way throughout the entire book, which is why I don't understand why Nora Roberts chose to put her at the center of everything. I liked Tess much more than I liked Willa. I hoped and hoped that she would be the one who would get together w/ Ben. And what was with all the other &quot;main&quot; characters??? They had maybe one scene each compared to the ten billion that Willa had. Other than that, I did enjoy this book. I just wish less of it had to deal with Willa.	2000-12-25

But if you compare it to her other books, it's not as great, but still a very good read. Nick's a bit ruthless in his treatment of Lauren, but I guess it's understandable considering his background and the time this piece was written. He was close to being violent however, and that was a big turnoff. He very nearly makes up for it in the end though, although I find Lauren to be too forgiving. It was the best fight-and-make-up sequences I've read though (even though it wasn't very realistic). It just didnt' seem as if Nick ever really came to trust Lauren though, like she had to earn her innocence back, which was the only reason Nick came back, not because he trusted her or loved her. It never seemed like Nick changed at all, even at the end. And none of the characters were really developed, even Nick and Lauren, but I understand that this was one of Mcnaught's first novels. And I enjoyed reading it very much.	2000-12-20

Much better than *Whitney, My Love*. I loved Stephen in that book, but he's a lot different in this one, in my opinion, much more serious. I liked him more in *Whitney* but he's still very lovable in here. The romance was wonderful, and i loved the relationship between Stephen and Sheridan. I loved how he tried to give her a chance to &quot;experiment&quot;, so to speak, before committing. It was all very cute. I just hate how it always seems as if McNaught makes the heros in her novels always assume that the heroines are fantastic actresses only interested in wealth and/or men. That gets a bit annoying. It happened in *Whitney*, *Until You*, *Paradise*, *Almost Heaven*, almost every McNaught book I've read. But still, I loved those stories. And this one is no exception. I wish Nicki DuVille would get a girl one of these days. Now, HE would be the best hero, in my opinion :) I think it's about time i read it again :)	2000-12-20

He's compassionate, romantic, intelligent....where can I find myself an Ian? :) I love how he comes to Elizabeth's rescue when he finds out what she has gone through in the past 2 years. This book kept me crying one second, then laughing the next. I didn't like the whole issue with Elizabeth's brother though. How could she have done that to Ian??? That was when I just wanted to go yell at her. I mean, I thought she was smarter than that!! How dumb can she be to not trust Ian, but trust her stupid brother instead?? I just didnt' like that whole conflict in this story, and then the courtroom scene. That was funny, but still, I started to not like Elizabeth after that. You can't blame Ian for being so angry like that. Overall, this was a good read, and i highly recommend it.	2000-12-19
US	49426738	RX2KQK652C9NA	0515120618	337464343	Montana Sky	Books	4	2	2	N	N	montana sky	Ok, this was a good book, better than all the other Nora Roberts books I had read. But the summary said that this was a book about three sisters. The only sister I seemed to constantly read about was Willa. And she was not my favorite character in the book. She just didnt' appeal to me. In fact, none of the characters really appealed to me. They all fit into their own little categories: Willa, the neglected daughter who became a strong woman; Tess, the &quot;typical&quot; spoiled, wealthy California girl who cared more about money than family; Lily, the abused one who now has to be treated like a china doll. To be honest, Willa was too cynical for my taste and even towards the end, I couldn't figure out why Roberts chose to put this particular sister at the center of the storyline. Yes, it was &quot;her&quot; ranch, but I would have liked to see it becoming the story of the Mercy sisters, rather than the story of Willa. At times I just wanted to smack her for some of the things she did and said. It would have been a much better book if the story had been spread out among the three couples, rather than one. The only character I truly liked was Ben McKinnon. He was the only one, I thought, to have any personality. The others were not developed as they should be, not even Willa. Most of the characters who were supposed to make up this story were simply minor characters, when they should have been more at the center. Especially the two other male characters. Adam seemed to have no opinion of his own. Yes he was sensitive, but he was BORING! And Nate, poor guy! He basically could have been played by a tree throughout the book! And then suddenly at the end, he and Tess have their moment, which lasted, oh, half a page. I guess Roberts really hated Tess or something, b/c maybe 5 pages were devoted to her. We begin to see into her at the beginning, with the scene with Tess and her mother, but this quickly stops...as soon as that scene ends. In my honest opinion, Tess would have been a better match for Ben. At least she had some personality! I would have rathered reading about any of the two other couples than Willa and Ben! And I find that Roberts repeats herself. What happened to Ben at the end was identical to what happened Adam after Lily's rescue 100 pages before. They both distanced themselves from their respective SO's for the exact same reason. Nevertheless, this was a very good book, (despite my negative review). I couldn't put it down at the end, but it sorta ended abruptly. I highly recommend this book to anyone, just don't be fooled by what's written at the back of the book. :)	2000-12-18

Roberts' *Born In...* trilogy was much better. and Doris Mortman's *Out of  Nowhere* is a much better romantic suspense novel. i enjoyed the dialogue  between noah and olivia though, especially the one in the forest. the  ending was a bit confusing for me, it just sort of stopped. i mean,  olivia's father dies, and then an hour later, she's planning her  wedding!  i had been expecting something more thrilling but there was  nothing to that effect. the romance between noah and olivia was cute and  Roberts would have been better off playing that angle more rather than  tying in murder. it was an ok read, but i found myself continuing to read  only so i could maybe convince myself that something exciting was going to  happen soon. well, nothing happened.	2000-09-08

I just  re-read it a few days ago and it still kept me awake, wanting to finish  just one more page. Amanda Maxwell/Erica Baird  is the ultimate heroine,  and Jake Fowler the perfect match for her. Doris Mortman obviously did her  research before attempting to create this story what with the details of  the witness protection program, money laundering, mobster, etc. She weaves  an intricate tale that pulls you in, and has you on the edge of your seat  while Max fights to get her life back. It has the perfect combination of  suspense, romance and intrigue that keeps you reading til the last page  when the villain is finally revealed as someone you least suspect.	2000-09-04

I just loved the story  and the characters. Although it lacked the passion and intensity that her  other novels had, this one had a tenderness that the others lacked. I  especially liked how *Remember When* began with Diana and Cole as teenagers  with a slowly developing friendship, despite their differences in  lifestyles. (For those who wonder when the two fell in love, maybe you  should consider re-reading that first part.) I have to admit, Diana was a  bit weak when compared with the heroines in McNaught's other novels, but  paired with Cole, they were just perfect! This book wasn't passionate, but  it was sweet. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Cole never  tells Diana he loves her even once. Some of my favorite scenes were those  during the White Orchid Ball when Cole comes to Diana's rescue. Chivalry  really does still exist! :)	2000-09-04

Even his father would have  been better! He was BORING. and what was with all the plots left hanging?  mainly the one involving Sara and Jess. i believe the last we hear of them  is when she slams the door in his face, then nothing. i have to admit, i  think i'd have rather read their story than Sloan's. the only reason i gave  this book 2 stars was because of the beginning, before Sloan left to meet  her father and sister. that part i honestly enjoyed, but after that, i just  could not continue reading.	2000-09-04
