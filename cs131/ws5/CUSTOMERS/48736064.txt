A Day Late and a Dollar Short is a novel that is like so of many of our own families.  Each reader will identify with some aspect of the Price family story.   <br />A Day Late and a Dollar Short chronicles a short time in the Price family.  By most accounts, this is a family that is on the edge.  The children are all grown with families and issues of their own.  The main players include:  Viola, the strong-willed matron and backbone of the family.  Her husband, Cecil, who is often absent and distant from his wife and children.  The eldest child, Paris, a successful career woman who doesn't trust love and copes by abusing substances.  The middle child, Charlotte feels like she is on the cusp of the family and is very resentful.  Lewis, the black sheep of the family, can never get his act together.  Finally, Janelle, the baby.  She is use to be assisted and does not know her true own true strength. Travel with the Price family through their personal obstacles and hurdles. <br />McMillan writes this novel in the first person so the reader knows what every character is individually thinking.  This was an effective means of developing each character.  By having a glimpse into the personal world and feelings of each Price family member, the reader was able to see a much more complicated and multidimensional person. <br />Through this novel, McMillan was able to communicate many universal truths of families:  Family is important; Family needs to be maintained; and ALL families have struggles and issues.  <br />As this was the first novel that I have read by McMillan, I do not have a base to compare.  A Day Late and A Dollar Short was an enjoyable read and I will soon try another McMillan novel.	2002-03-17

The novel starts with great promise - a missing child in need of life-sustaining medical treatment.  The Courage Tree captured my attention for the first 200 pages, and then it seemed to just lose its steam.  <br />The writing is clear and strong however, certain aspects of the plot were somewhat unbelievable.  When there is a missing child a reader expects to feel the loss and intensity however, many of Chamberlain's characters seemed over concerned with their relationships that the missing child was only shadowed.<br />Without revealing the plot, the ending was tied up far too perfectly and far too quickly.  The Courage Tree had great promise to be something more than it was.  Should you endeavor to read The Courage Tree, know that your expectations may be challenged. <br />As this was the first novel that I have read by Chamberlain, I will give her another try with her latest, 'Cypress Point.'	2002-03-06

Applause to India Edghill for writing the novel, 'Queenmaker.'  In the spirit of Diamant's Red Tent, Edghill has forged her own ground with a novel that truly stands on it's own.  <br />Queenmaker is written through the eyes of Michal, first wife of King David.  The story may not reflect exactly what the bible tells, rather it is written from a female's perspective.  As we know, there are two sides to every story, and if we dare, Queenmaker gives voice to Michal's story. <br />Queenmaker begins as Saul is being annointed King of Israel and Michal, his youngest daughter is approaching womanhood.  Enter David, a shepards son, that earns the trust of the King Saul as a great warrior.  Soon David and Michal marry and that is where the story begins.  Admidst twists and turns, the reader becomes engrossed in the politics and injustices of the time.<br />Edhill has carefully examined the role of women as well as the religious and political structures in biblical society.  Looking beyond the traditional role of women, Queenmaker is simply Michal's story.  Although a work of fiction, one can not help but wonder what other stories biblical women would have to tell.     <br />Queenmaker, is an amazing account of historical fiction. If you are interested in further historical fiction, I would also recommend: Pope Joan - Donna Woolfolk Cross, Slammerkin - Emma Donoghue, and of course, The Red Tent - Anita Diamant.	2002-02-25

Donna Woolfolk Cross has brought the legend of Pope Joan to life. The novel is written in a fictional sense, but weaves many of the little known facts into the tale.  You decide for yourself...<br />Joan was considered a very abnormal woman who's desire to learn was ungodly and considered sinful.  A woman's place was to be subserviant to men.  The reader will experience the struggle and conflict that Joan experienced as she embarked on her journey of higher actualization.  To say that Joan was immune from seeking and wanting love would be untrue.  The reader will follow Joan as she reconciles her feeling for her one true love.  <br />The characters have been created with amazing detail and are a very good representation of the time.  One can create a visual image of the atire; the struggle to meet basic needs; and mostly the status and order that prevailed among the classes.<br />I highly recommend Pope Joan, both to the individual and to any book club.  This novel was truly engrossing, it offers a different perspective than the traditional patriarical view of past times.  Pope Joan will spark conversations, heighten your awareness, and remain in your memory for a very long time.	2001-06-04

Through bad relationships, a neurotic mother, disgruntled room-mates, lonliness, and a cat (fatboy), that only loves you conditionally, Maxted will leave you satisfied looking for more.<br />Although she is a little quirky and sometimes has bad luck, one cannot help but cheer when Helen finds success.  The characters are extremely well developed, and the reader will easily capture a visual picture in their mind.  Maxted has taken a peek at the ordinary and made it hilarious.<br />I applaud Anna Maxted, she has a true gift for making people laugh at life's off times!  I'm anxiously awaiting for Maxted's newest!	2001-05-15

The reader will eagerly be turning the pages to find out what happens to each of these people as their paths intertwine.<br />The story is set in the quiet and ordinary town of Salem Falls.

Accused for the same crime twice ~ it will be Jordan McAffee that assists Jack during his trial.  Some may remember Jordan as the lawyer from Picoults previous novel, 'The Pact'.    <br />Picoult is the master of creating suspensful stories that immediately capture the reader until the very last page is turned.  As in true Picoult style, there are many surprises and twists along the way. I guarantee if you read this novel, you'll be hooked and looking for more!	2001-04-17

So the tale begins...<br />The reader will journey with Kwan through many past lives and her communications to 'yin people'.  The yin people are those that have died and communicate to her ~ ghosts.  The ever reserved and practical Olivia, finds Kwan's behaviour and beliefs odd and unbelievable.<br />The Hundred Secret Senses follows the lives of Olivia and Kwan as they create and define their relationship.  It is the story of coming to terms with ones self, as well as accepting those around you for who they are.  The reader will participate in the great struggle that Olivia has with this challenge.  <br />The reader will be challenged to question their own beliefs of the yin people or the afterlife.  I only recently discovered Amy Tan and The Hundred Secret Senses is equally as brilliant as The Bonesetters Daughter. I would recommend this novel!	2001-04-11

The reader will follow Icy during the trials and transistions in her life, the tics, and uncontrollable cursing as she comes to terms with her disorder. <br />The novel is set in the 1950's, an era that was not understanding and tolerant to differences. Icy faced community and peer rejection in her small southern community.  The rejection that Icy experiences is unforgettable and her strength over adversity is courageous.<br />Icy's supporting cast of characters include her grandparents and her best friend Miss Emily.  It is only with her grandparents and Miss Emily that Icy feels relaxed and at ease. Through these people Icy learns to accept herself and take risks! Icy began as a strong willed child who eventually blossoms into a determined woman.      <br />This novel will evoke many feelings inside the reader and it is likely a very good representation of the time and the response to differences.  I appalued Gwyn Hyman Rubio for bringing the issue of Tourettes Syndrome to the forefront!	2001-03-31

The Bonesetters daughter follows present day, Ruth as she struggles in her relationships with Art, her significant other; her mother, LuLing; and most importantly, herself.  <br />Luling is a very traditional Chinese woman who is living with a dreadful past of her own.  Luling struggles to identify with her daughter Ruth.  As Luling is developing dementia she decides to record her history on paper as her mother did for her.  Ruth dismissed the memoir until many years later when she had it translated and discovered her mother's past as well as her grandmother's (Precious Auntie) past.  Through this memoir, Ruth discovered the truth about the women in her family and the truth for herself.<br />Amy Tan created very strong women and their journey and trials will attest to their nature of survival.  The Bonesetters Daughter was by far one of the best books that I have encountered.	2001-03-20

Dorris starts the novel through the perspective of the daughter, Rayona, then to the mother, Christine, and finally to the grandmother, Ida, where it all began.     <br />As you read A Yellow Raft In Blue Water you learn and feel the struggles of each woman.  Often I found myself thinking, 'that's why' as I progressed through each woman's story and connecting the three.  Dorris describes this journey as &quot;...bonding and braiding the three strands of their shared past - and future.&quot;  <br />Michael Dorris created a novel far more powerful than the struggle of the three women.  He illustrated the need for family and how the connection to kin, no matter the circumstance and time lapse, is of great importance.  He displayed that in time of need you always go back to the familiar...home.<br />This was a very moving and thought provoking novel to read.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone!	2001-03-11

The reader is taken along the road of struggle, bravery, and being true to one's self.  <br />Try this book for a bookclub as I am sure that it will evoke many feelings and a great discussion.  What is more important and discussion worthy than the mother-daughter relationship?	2001-03-09

These three groups will become intertwined in very realistic and ordinary ways.  Plainsong presents a look at everyday people dealing with their life issues.<br />Haruf paints a picture for the reader of the need for family and challenges the reader to think about what constitutes a family.  The message that I gained from reading Plainsong was that of family by choice.  Once you have love, caring and commitment within a group of people you have the seeds of a family.<br />Plainsong was an interesting novel to read. Often as readers we expect the deep and dark rather than the ordinary.  This is a new concept to behold.  I have spent alot of time reflecting on Plainsong and the strongest message is of the necessity family in any form.  I would recommend this book.	2001-02-13

The not knowing and suspense is what made this novel a great read.  <br />Dubus created characters that will continue to be very memorable long after the book is put down. At times the reader despises them, but turn the page and your opinion will shift again.  The characters, Kathy, a needy woman; Lester, a cop on the edge; Mr. Berhrani, a former colonel in seach of respect in a new country, collide tragically in their attempt to maintain ownership of this house.  For ownership means a new career and dignity for the Colonel and his family, and Kathy it signifies stability and progress.   <br />House of Sand and Fog captures the issues of dependence (emotional, physical, and substance), status in society, family, desperation, and immigration.  The book challenges the readers values and morals.    <br />This was by far the least predictable book that I have ever encountered.  A great read individually or for a book club!	2001-01-25

Miranda Boyle (Mandy) had everything against her - an alcoholic father, an abusive, self-centred mother, and most importantly a lack of love.  Through our parents we learn how to give and accept love, Mandy was never shown love, and in turn never believed that she was worthy of being loved.<br />The quickening, the stage in pregnancy when a fetus first shows signs of having life, is a very powerful analogy that is used to detail Mandy's search for love, and ultimately self.  Qickening is the coming of age story of a young woman who quickly learns her life is in her own hands and she must make many difficult decisions.       <br />Mandy, like so many young women, battle with self-esteem, are unable to be assertive, and struggle to find their place in the world.  Mandy often sought love through substances and the attention of men. Mandy was not able to distinguish between true love and lust.  <br />Quickening will have you follow Mandy on her journey of reconciling and renegotiating her relationships - most importantly the relationship with herself. Laura Catherine Brown, illistrates this concept perfectly, &quot;I would wake up there and face myself.&quot;<br />Laura Cathering Brown is an author that I will seek out again.

One Thousand White Women is by far one of the best books that I have encountered. The characters have been beautifully created and it is interesting to see many well known historical figures and landmarks interwoven into the story. One Thousand White Women is a story of cultures, relationships, understanding, loss, overcoming, and ultimately, love.      <br />It is the story of 'civilized' society's lost and non-traditional white women who, for various reasons of their own, enlist in a goverment program to wed Cheyenne men.  Each of these women present themselves in roles often not portrayed by mainstream women of the time.  This makes the book very interesting.  In contrast, Jim Fergus also illistrates Native culture and looks at the ordinary things that history often misses; relationships, humour, and the methods of survival among the people.<br />The story is told through the eyes and pen of May Dodd as she details her experience among the Cheyenne people in a journal. In this journal she reconciles fears, indentifies similarities and differences in cultures, finds love, and yearns for peace.  <br />I would and have highly recommended this book to others.  It is very thought provoking and would provide excellent discussion among book clubs.	2000-11-03
