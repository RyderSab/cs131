US	52871985	R1H5VYIHV3UAX7	0380007959	694769505	1: The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of All Time	Books	5	2	2	N	N	The Rise and Passage of the Golden Age	This book takes you on a journey through the Golden Age of science fiction, and into the first steps of the New Age. It isn't true that this contains the &quot;greatest science fiction stories of all time,&quot; because it only contains work prior to 1963 (this anthology was first published in 1970).<br />A few of the stories will seem campy by today's standards. &quot;Martian Odyssey,&quot; by Stanley Weinbaum (1934) will show you just how far today's authors have come in terms of storytelling and prose styling.  From those humble beginnings, the genre takes off like a rocket.<br />John Campbell's &quot;Twighlight&quot; (1934) show many of the themes and ideas--alienation, wonder, potential misuse of science--that would often define the Golden Age. &quot;Nightfall&quot; by Isaac Asimov (1941) is probably the best of the early stories, showing perfect plotting and construction, combined with scientific ideas and thinking. As time marches on, we encounter such stories as &quot;Scanners Live in Vain,&quot; by Cordwainer Smith (1948) which shows us a future society without burying us under the type of exposition that previously weighed-down other work; by 1954, we have &quot;Fondly Fahrenheit,&quot; by Alfred Bester, a head-spinning, poetic, tour de force of a tale. &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; (1959) is one of the best-plotted, most poignant tales of the Golden Age. The book ends with &quot;A Rose for Ecclesiastes,&quot; rife with the poetic, experimental style that would become a theme for much of the science fiction literature of the New Wave.<br />Unfortunately, a few of the stories don't age that well--and it is necessary for readers to realize that science fiction has continued to evolve in the decades since this book's publication. Nevertheless, it contains a large number of wonderful stories and--and serves as a schematic for the genre's development over four decades.	2004-06-12

Cosmos, filled with his awe for the universe, was one of the first things I read as a child that got me excited about science. I also enjoyed his novel, Contact. As good as those things are, I predict that THE DEMON-HAUNTED WORLD will live on as a testimony to the wonder of the natural world, combined with the tools--and reasons--to question everything.<br />Sagan debunks myths regarding UFOs, alien abduction and other supernatural events. The mantra here is to believe nothing; instead, weigh evidence. Ask questions.<br />Chapter 12, &quot;The Fine Art of Baloney Detection&quot; should be required reading in logic, philosophy and introductory science courses. People could gain a lot by getting exposure to these thinking tools.<br />Sagan does an excellent job of combining historical accounts alongside the lessons in skepticism. His passion for science spills out of the page, showing that one does not need superstitions to make the world interesting and exciting.<br />Towards the last few chapters, politics become an increasing theme within his essays. Unfortunately, I think this distracts from the overall message of the book. Nevertheless, even this can not lessen its overall strength.<br />THE DEMON-HAUNTED WORLD is a wonderful, vibrant and hopeful giant of a book.	2004-06-11

This book was written by the science-fiction master well into his career, demonstrating a significant improvement in his powers. This builds on the characters introduced in Caves of Steel and Naked Sun. You should read those before venturing into this novel.<br />Asimov combines the mystery genre and many of his futurist ideas together in this series. Not only do you get to experience a great mystery-adventure, but you're also exploring the social consequences of near-human robots. Daneel Olivaw, the robot partner to detective Elijah Baley, is one of the most memorable characters in the field of speculative fiction.<br />This is the best place to start reading Asimov. The sequel, Robots and Empire, is excellent as well. After reading the Robots books, try the Foundation series, which starts slower but gets very good--and ultimately rewards readers of the Robot books by tieing it all together.	2004-05-10

I found that there was a linear improvement in Asimov's writing through all of the robot novels.<br />Not only do you get to experience a great mystery-adventure, but you're also exploring the social consequences of near-human robots and the continued urbanization of the Earth along with man's push into space.<br />Daneel Olivaw, the robot partner to detective Elijah Baley, is one of the most memorable characters in the field of speculative fiction.<br />This is the best place to start reading Asimov; however, you should begin by reading the first novel in the series, Caves of Steel. If you enjoy these two, you will absolutely love the sequels. After reading the Robots books, try the Foundation series, which starts slower but gets very good--and ultimately rewards readers of the Robot books by tieing it all together.	2004-05-10
US	52871985	R4WA4YB77JTP2	0441569595	769194143	Neuromancer	Books	3	5	12	N	N	Idea-rich but weak storytelling, see below for alternatives	I have a love-hate relationship with this novel. On the one hand, its got so many damn-good ideas, and it's worth reading for that alone. I won't spoil the fun of uncovering the ideas, because that's the meat of the book--unfortunately, Gibson does not prove to be as strong a storyteller as he is an idea-man. The ideas are buried between dense prose that mesmerizes one into a fugue-state. The plotting is weak at best, often leading one to think that the places visited exist solely to showcase the technologies of the story. Character motives defy analysis. It is told from the viewpoint of an anti-hero, which is not bad in itself, but you are often left wondering what the point is--does he really learn anything?<br />The story is really a means of exposing Gibson's ideas about future societies, computers and biological science. In that, it truly shines. Fortunately, the book is fairly short and thus it is saved from itself. Neuromancer gets very high marks for originality and subject matter, but low for the craft of storytelling.<br />If you are interested in this genre, then Neal Stephenson does the best job in SNOW CRASH. Bruce Sterling does an admirable job in SCHISMATRIX as well (although I'm uncertain about applying the cyberpunk label to it). Lastly, Philip K. Dick deals with similar material in DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP (the film upon which Bladerunner was loosely based). He wrote it before the emergence of the \\"cyberpunk\\" term, although critics probably would have included it had he written it during the early nineties.	2004-05-10

Most people agree it is a subgenre of science fiction, that it has something to do with the relationship to man and his machines, and that it tends towards an idea-rich, &quot;crammed&quot; prose style. Bruce Sterling and William Gibson are the two other others most often associated with this field. Neal Stephenson, in Snow Crash, does the best of all. He proposes many futurist ideas without sacrificing the storytelling, and his characters are amongst the most memorable. If you were turned off to this genre due to the weak plotting and dense prose of Gibson, it's time to give it a second chance with this novel.	2004-05-10

I have no idea, because it is pretty distant from the likes of Gibson or Stephenson. If you've been turned off by the amoral bladerunneresque computer-noir of the typical cyberpunk novel, you won't find it here. What you will find is an epic comprising the 150+ year journey of a man through the social and technolical changes spawned by advanced biology, human-machine integration and life extension therapy.<br />In the universe of this book, there are two factions vying for control of mankind's destiny. First is the Shapers, who disdain machines and focus on the biological sciences and improvement of man through genetic engineering. The other is the Mechanists, who utilize computers and machines to enhance and extand their capabilities.<br />While it isn't the most stellar prose in terms of plotting or characters, it is chock-full of gooey, sweet ideas. He admits to writing in a &quot;crammed prose&quot; style in the introduction; but unlike Gibson, he does so without putting you to sleep.<br />After the novel there are a set of short stories also set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. These are excellent. Other reviewers liked them more than the novel itself, and I'm inclined to agree.<br />One of the reviewers on the back cover calls Sterling &quot;better than drugs,&quot; and I have come to appreciate the comparison: I feel like I'm having idea-flashbacks even now. This is good stuff!	2004-05-10

Dick takes us on a journey through one of the most unthinkable \\"what if\\" scenarios: Germany has won World War II. Through tidbits along the way, we learn of some of the factors that contributed the the defeat of the United States. It's a well thought-out alternative history.<br />Without spoiling anything, I'll tell you that there is a \\"book within the book.\\" When you read about this, ask yourself exactly what Dick is satirizing--what is he getting at?<br />Unfortunately I found the ending unsatisfying. However, the book is memorable, and a good reminder of a possible world that was prevented by the actions of the Allies in WWII.	2004-04-26

We'll Remember it for your Wholesale and Minority Report are simply great stories. I would give each of those stories five stars, and many others are excellent as well, although perhaps not as consistent.<br />I feel that Dick shined as a teller of short-stories, and these exceed his longer works.<br />One of the pleasures of reading Dick's short stories is that they seem to turn into a feature film every couple of years. It's fun to see a movie preview, and within a few seconds say, \\"That's a Dick story!\\" even though the ultimate film doesn't always measure up.	2004-04-26

However, you'll find many of the themes right here: alienation, our relationship to machine intelligence, the fusion of worldwide cultures, the noir-world of moral relativism.<br />This is the story that the film Bladerunner (excellent in its own right) was based on. However, it is important to realize that the film was very loosely based on it; there is one scene in the book that is virtually identical to the film, but beyond that it is quite different.<br />Unfortunately, I find that Dick can really meander towards the end of his longer works (unlike his tightly plotted short stories). Thus, I can only give it four stars. Nevertheless it is a timeless classic that will be of interest to anyone interested in what the future of man-machine interactions might hold.	2004-04-25

The protaganist is Blackthorne, an Englishman who captains a Dutch privateer around 1600. He comes to Japan and becomes embroiled in the politics of that time, learns about bushido, falls in loves, and befriends one of the most powerful people in feudal Japan.<br />When he comes to Japan, it is a completely alien society to him. He is unprepared for a civilization that regards money and trade with disdain, and where life can be thrown away so easily. It is a place where duty overshadows every other virtue. If you read a lot of science-fiction, you'll notice that a similar them exists in &quot;first contact&quot; stories where humans come in contact with aliens that have bizarre worldviews. In some ways, the culture of Japan as presented here is just as strange as (or more than) any of these extraterrestrial cultures. By the end of the book, you will comprehend the beauty and values of the culture, and characters that acted in nearly incomprehensible ways will become logical.<br />The politics and intrigue are riveting. It is fascinating to be taken into the minds of many different characters as they vie for power--yet you are never taken all the way in. A shadow always conceals much of the ambitions and strategies of the key characters.  The plotting is unpredictable, while at the same time being entirely believable--because the characters make it believable.	2004-04-16

However, this is where you need to begin--don't jump ahead.  This is a thought-provoking and entertaining read in its own right.<br />Asimov combines the mystery genre and many of his futurist ideas together in this series.  You'll enter a world where people live underground because there isn't enough living space, and where many people have grown resentful of robots that are taking over jobs that humans once held. Not only do you get to experience a great mystery-adventure, but you're also exploring the social consequences of near-human robots and the continued urbanization of the Earth.<br />Daneel Olivaw, the robot partner to detective Elijah Baley, is one of the most memorable characters in the field of speculative fiction.<br />This is the best place to start reading Asimov.

This is an extremely enjoyable science fiction story that blends future politics, warfare, alien first-contact, relativistic space travel and computer technology.  The main character learns important lessons about might vs. right.  It also shows us how extermely brilliant people can be manipulated by less gifted, powerhungry political forces.<br />Ender's Game is fast paced, easy to read and extremely fun.  It's also interesting to see how Card wrote about things like electronic bulletin boards that would not emerge for many more years.  Maybe he is prescient about other aspects as well?<br />Some of the sequels are good as well, although none quite stand up to the sparkle of the original.  This is a story that you'll compare to many others for years to come.	2004-04-04

I will leave it to the reader to enjoy the litany that includes the famous phrase, &quot;Fear is the Mind Killer.&quot;<br />Herbert successfully weaves an epic tale of rebellion and religion.  It is the tale of a man who becomes a messiah, and discovers many things about himself, the Empire he lives in, and the world of Dune.<br />Herbert paints a world in which man can travel between stars, yet no longer uses computers; a place where fencing skills are often more useful than energy weapons; a land of soldiers, assassins, prophets, mystics, nobles, monsters.  It is about love, passion, resistance--and the effect that the appearance of a messiah has on a culture.<br />Sadly, much of Herbert's sequels don't live up to this first book.  However, it is an entirely satisfying epic in its own right--if you never read the other books, this one will still live on in your memory forever.	2004-04-01

It also provides a very believable account of how people might perceive technologies that have become incomprehensible.  For example, one of the characters marvels over why ancient people put metal bars into stone (it is rebar reinforced concrete).  It shows us how even things that we perceive as mundane in the modern world could take on a mystical nature to those who lack understanding.<br />For me, the best of this book was the first two thirds.  These are the parts where the writing really shines and the you get a sense of how humanity could endure and rediscover science through a neo-dark age.  The last part is very good as well, but I think the authors voice begins to creep into the story and the characters, and events unfold more for the benefit of the point he's trying to make more than any other factor.	2004-03-29

People who are hungry for more will enjoy this.<br />Unlike Lord of the Rings, this isn't a novel.  It is more of a collection of essays, stories and exposition.  However, it is a lot more readable than the Silmarillion.  After reading some of the tales in here, you will sound like a Tolkien guru.  If it hasn't slaked your thirst, you could move on to the much denser Silmarillion.	2004-03-27

It would also be helpful to anyone who is engaged in a roleplaying game based on Middle Earth.  Overall, most people will enjoy Unfinished Tales more than this book--because it is a lot lighter and more story-oriented.<br />However, do not be deceived:  this is no novel.  It is told in a historical-narrative format, and is extremely dense.  Even if you loved Lord of the Rings, it is unlikely that you will enjoy it.  This is essentially exposition, not storytelling.<br />In time, when Tolkien receives the literary recognition he is truly entitled to, I envision high school students reading excerpts of the Silmarillion as part of learning about the process of worldbuilding that went into twentieth-century fantasy literature.  Unfortunately, they will find this task boring--hopefully they will enjoy Lord of the Rings anyway.<br />If you are a Tolkien fanatic and you really want to see this process in action--if you want to understand what happened in the thousands of years prior to the Hobbit, and want to know the lineage of all the main characters--this book will be for you.  However, I'd advise reading Unfinished Tales first.  This deals with a lot of the same material in a more readable format.	2004-03-27

I re-read it again (at age 29) just before the films came out, and was reminded why I loved it so much.  This is a story that can be read by young and old, and it will fill you with a sense of wonder and excitement.<br />Tolkien has certain weaknesses as a writer (he couldn't bear to remove any part, even the bad stuff) and so much happens \\"suddenly\\" in the story.  Nevertheless, he's vivid imagination, worldbuilding and touching descriptions tower above some of these minor flaws.<br />None single book is truly a novel unto itself.  The books were originally published together, and unlike recent fantasy series, each work tends to lack its own storytelling crescendo.  Make sure you read all three books together.  For me, the Two Towers was the most enjoyable section of the story because it goes the furthest towards exploring the characters of Sam and Frodo.<br />Lord of the Rings wasn't the first modern fantasy of the twentieth century (check out Fritz Leibers stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser for something excellent that is earlier).  However, it is the most influential. Almost every fantasy book and fantasy roleplaying game created in the last few decades owes something to Tolkien.  After you read Lord of the Rings, you will know why!  Enjoy it, and be taken on a journey you will never forget.	2004-03-27

It presents a number of thought-provoking historical and theological concepts which many people may not be familiar with.  As a story, the plot itself is somewhat trite and the characters are made of cardboard.  Nevertheless, the ideas and puzzles presented through its staccato-pacing are what make the book worthwhile.<br />Religious fanatics should probably avoid this book.  It uncovers uncomfortable truths about Christianity.  Come to it with an open mind, and remember that this is a work of fiction.  Dan Brown likely stretched facts (all well within the range of poetic license), but many of the ideas are plausible.  You will probably find yourself googling for the information presented in the book, just to learn more for yourself.  Possibly, this book will be your gateway to other fiction in this domain, including such works as Focault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco.

Yossarian is a man who has already gone beyond the call of duty for his country, yet is forced beyond his breaking point by men who are more interested in wealth and power than in concluding the conflict.<br />In our lives and work, most of us observe people making decisions driven by personal ambitions and ego to the detriment of all around them.  Catch-22 is a dark comedy of those traits when they play out in the most lethal business of all:  the business of war.<br />Heller's writing style breaks many of the literati's proscribed rules.  He makes heavy use of repetition, along with strings of adjectives and adverbs.  Although the story spends a lot of time exploring the characters, it does little to develop its nonlinear plot. Nevertheless, I found the rhythm of his writing hypnotic and engaging. You'll find yourself turning the pages to learn more about the people of the story.	2004-03-25

The ruling elite utilizes a mindreading technology to review the quality of one's life, and this is used to reward or punish a person with either a better or worse form.  In effect, science has discovered the means to mirror the Hindu concepts of karma and reincarnation.<br />These technologies are used to solidify the power of the Deicrats, the ruling elite of the planet.  Morality is secondary to how well one supports their grip on power.  Those who oppose the structure are destroyed.  Those who are in power, the ones who hoped to style themselves after gods, are driven by the same dark emotions that have powered mankind through history:  ambition, jealosy and greed.  This story is about Sam, a man forced to choose between joining with this system of power, or rebelling against it.<br />While this is a relatively short book (by modern science-fiction standards), it is also dense reading.  Slogging through the first chapter and a half is necessary before things really start to click along.<br />This is a novel that is rich with ideas.  It demonstrates the harm that can be caused by caste systems borne out technological haves and have-nots.  It portrays the classic theme of &quot;absolute power corrupts absolutely,&quot; but also shows that goodness exists within a few humans to oppose corruption.  It does both of these against a unique, Hindu-inspired backdrop supported by the necessary science.<br />Your enjoyment of this book will probably be driven by the type of science-fiction reader you are.  If you want something heavy on ideas and milieu, you will probably love this.  If you want something that is more character-driven, this may not satisfy you as much.  Despite its shortness, you may find yourself downshifting your reading-gears: dialogues often consist of a dozen or more lines of unattributed text--and charactersdon't speak in particularly unique voices.  Some characters are known by multiple names, which I found initially confusing.  Despite this, I can't imagine that anyone interested in speculative fiction could be fluent in the genre without exposure to this fascinating tale.	2004-03-25
US	52871985	RU2XJSVMP711D	0345316509	380323119	Job: A Comedy of Justice	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Life-changing and thought-provoking	I first read this book as a teenager.  Perhaps this was the best time I could have opened the cover to Job, a time when I was questioning many of the things I had been taught.  My mind was pliant clay where ideas were constantly clashing.  I was a  youth who suspected that society was rife with hypocrisy and lies.<br />Why do we believe what we do?  Why are certain parables regarded as examples of morality?  Have we been conditioned to believe that great evils were in fact just and moral?  What the heck is morality anyway?<br />These are a few of the questions that Job will challenge you with.  It is a book that left an indelible impression on me, and caused me to reject many of the things I had been force-fed as a child.<br />If you are looking for Heinlein's typical science-fiction, you won't find it here.  Instead you'll find a story spun from Heinlein's ascerbic wit that navigates the human system of beliefs and values, and does so with greater incisiveness than he's done in any other title.	2004-03-25

I would have liked to see a lot more information on less common nut varieties (e.g., chestnuts, pine nuts, etc.)  And there was little to no information on apple, pear, plum, etc.  There are better books that cover fruit in general, and there are citrus specialty books if that's your main interest.	2002-08-04

Simmons will challenge  your basic assumptions about the cosmos, will fill  your mind with awesome mental images, and grip you with fascinating tales  of adventure and sadness.  This is a book you will either love or hate --  and you'll know which before you get far into it.	1998-09-03
