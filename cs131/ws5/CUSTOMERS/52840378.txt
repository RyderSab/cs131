Firstly, a good half of the book is taken up with the PRE-war planning on invading Iraq, rehashing material presented (much better) in Woodward's or Clark's books. <br /> <br />When we finally get to the post-invasion planning, the book suffers from a fatal flaw - the author's own axe-grinding. The author was a principal on the multi-agency project, led as I remember out of the State Department, which compiled a long set of guides for how the reconstruction should go. In one of the more notable (but already known) failures, these guides were discarded by the Bush administration, as the authors were viewed as too \\"soft\\". OK, fine. However, the author harps on this over and over and over. Over and over, the book reads like this: \\"So then Bremer made this decision, which turned out wrong. We told you so.\\". <br /> <br />This is also weakened by the fact that the authors recommendation is virtually _always_ \\"form a multi-sided commission to study the issue\\" - not exactly gripping reading. Frankly, I can see why more action-minded minds might have started to ignore the author and his comission - sometimes multi-sided comissions are not the right answer! <br /> <br />The blurb for the book gives the impression that the author was a \\"True believer\\" (one of Rice's friends, etc.) who became disullusioned over time. This may be true, but the book is written instead with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight - the author's recommendations were always right, Bremer's/Cheney's always wrong, according to the book. Not only does this strain credulity, but it made this a rather unenlightening read for me - i would have been much more interested in something that discussed how the planning _evolved_, rather than the litany of \\"we told you so's\\" that this book presents. <br />	2005-07-23

Frankly, I was expecting a typical politician's book, full of applause lines and self-serving anecdotes, and thin on depth.<br />What I found was exactly the opposite. Though the book is quite short, it is quite deep and thoughtful. McCain ponders some deep issues: what is courage? how can it be taught? what's the difference between valor and courage? Between fearlesness and courage? Between courage and zealotry? I really got the impression of an author giving us his deeply considered thoughts. Bravo!	2004-05-15

What a great read! Much better than \\"Crusade\\", by the way, mainly I think because of the greater amount of source material available to the author.<br />The book succeeds on all fronts. At the top level, it does a fine job outlining the strategy employed by the generals, and has some excellent character sketches - I felt it gave nuanced and interesting portrayals of Eisenhower, Churchill, Giraud, Roosevelt,and especially Patton, with many other lower-level commanders also well described.<br />But where this book really shines is in its \\"micro-history\\". You won't just read that the X brigade attacked town Y to outflank enemy brigade Z. You'll read about what the rations were like, how well the boots were made, how the people in X's home town were informed of the battle, how town Y's name was mispronounced, how the ladies at town Y's brothel hitched a ride on X's tanks (there's a fabulous image where the book descries them \\"waving like beauty pageant contestants\\" from a Sherman tank), and on and on. Atkinson does a great job here of putting in enough detail, and enough _interesting_ detail, that you really get a picture of the time and place, but not enough detail that you get swamped in minutaie.<br />A great read - I read a lot of history, and this is probably the best read I've had in the last few years. I liked it so much, I'll probably even pay for the hardcover version of volume 2!	2003-06-17

The problem is that the author writes this as really an &quot;after-action report&quot; to his superiors, so the prose is extremely heavy on orginizational details. Just to give you a flavor, here are passages from two pages chosen at random:<BR>(1, p. 91): &quot;It now became necessary to provide FUSAG with armies of its own. This wa done on the one hand by fictitiously detaching the First Canadian Army from 21 Army Group and putting it under the command of FUSAG&quot;<BR>(2, p. 275):&quot;Under the new scheme, Three would be at the head,  7(2) would be called in to act as freelance, taking the place of Seven in that respect. The territory of 7 (4) would be enlarged to include Kent as well as Sussex, thus filling the gap caused by 7 (2)'s departure. 7(7) and 3(3) would continue as before, the former in the Eastern counties and the latter in Scotland&quot;.<br />I hope you get my point - authoritative and detailed, but not exactly a page-turner.	2002-12-02

What isn't stressed in the description is that in addition to being a DHTML ref, it also has very complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript refs within it.

Some authors clearly gave a lot of thought to their counterfactuals, and plausibly draw Very Large conclusions from Very Small changes (e.g what if an obscure middle-aged Greek named Socrates had died in battle?). conversely, however, some of the counterfactuals wind up drawing Very Small conclusions from Very Large changes (what if Hitler had been brought to trial after WWII? After much hemming and hawing, the author basically concludes, &quot;not much&quot;).	2001-10-25

However, I found the actual plot enormously disappointing. Without giving too much away, suffice to say that the concept largely recedes as the author spends most of the book using the science-fiction &quot;hook&quot;  as a veneer for discussing his thoughts on Issues Of the Day (&quot;what would the inhabitants of Omicron Beta III think about abortion?&quot;). Furthermore the book requires that you feel that Canadians are so utterly phlegmatic that the daily presence of an Alien in their midst, after a few days, is treated largely with a shrug - no extra security for the alien, no extra recording/monitoring/vetting of the conversations with the alien, etc.<br />I don't want to sound like too much of a fussbudget, but those two were just too much for me to swallow - more emphasis on the essential concept and a lot less on the gassing about public policy would have made this a great book.	2001-08-14

I'm a big fan of time-travel and alternate history novels, and this one started terrifically, but I found the central plot device so hard to swallow that it really hurt the book for me. Without giving anything away, the assumption is that the publication of a _fictional_ book in _English_ which paints Germany in an unflattering light somehow gets the entire German nation in an enormous lather.<br />For better treatments in the same vein, I would recommend either &quot;Time on My Hands&quot; by Peter Delacorte, or &quot;Replay&quot; by Ken Grimwood.	2001-08-01

The first few chapters are quite strong at setting the stage, but after that, though the book is very strong on atmosphere and descriptive plotting, it's extremely thin on plot.

Each time I re-read it, I got different takes on it. &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is a book that tells a story on many levels - it's a story of the folly of imperialism, it's an adventure yarn, it's an exploration of the pros and cons of Victorian society, and at its heart (so to speak!) it's really an examination of the archetypal Film Noir issue - how is a good man to resist temptation and keep to a moral code (and what code, and why?) in a world which does not adhere to that code, a world full of darkness.	2001-07-03

Just a few more points to add: (1) I think what sticks in my mind more than anything else are the horrific marches and the lack of medical care - the authors descriptions are all the more memorable for their off-handed understatement. (2) It's also an interesting recording of the social mores of the time - the author feels that the Lash is a necessity, and deplores the idea of having promotions done by merit rather than by noble birth.

I like the Lenson series, mainly for its authentic descriptions of what it's like to serve as an officer on ship (as a civilian, I don't know if it's REALLY authentic, but it works for me!)<br />However, the author falls prey to a failure common to many of these books, which are to pile on SO many obstacles for Our Hero to overcome that after a while you stop gripping your seat and start rolling your eyes.<br />For example, without giving anything away, Our Hero not only has to deal with a ship with almost no supplies, and then the XO is worse than worthless, andthen the ship is severely undercrewed, and then one of them may be a serial killer, and then they can't get any orders, ... and then... and then...

As others have posted, the plot is very interesting, kept my interest almost to the end, and the portrayals of the Navy at the Pentagon seemed very realistic.

I knew about halfway through who the Villain was, just seemed too obvious.<br />Secondly, almost every African-American character, even the educated ones, typically speak in some sort of Jive (&quot;she be easy to look at&quot;, that sort of thing).

My eyes were rolling throughout at the repeated fantastic coincidences the author lards onto the plot - the &quot;by an amazing coincidence, it just so happens that&quot; events you are asked to swallow are far too many and far too implausible.<br />The basic setting(espionage around one of the early US rocket launches) is a good one, but everything else is a let down.<br />Finally, this is a minor thing, but the author has characters repeatedly refer to &quot;Xeroxing&quot; things and &quot;carrying Xeroxes&quot; around - Xerox machines were hardly common in 1958, and their usage as a verb was many years away.	2001-06-12

Dunning has developed as a writer since his earlier books, and quickly draws you in to a fascinating and engrossing film noir.<br />However, the narrative quickly moves the plot to a radio station, where the author makes the mistake of falling in love with his setting at the expense of the plot. Many, many pages are devoted to tender loving description of WWII radio and every single person who worked at the radio station, greatly diminishing the pull and impact of the mystery.<br />Coulda been great, as it is just OK.	2001-02-21

I give it five stars even though it is somewhat lop-sided: although it claims to be a history of Rome, China, and Judea in the first century, the author shows a decidedly western bias. Counting the sections, I see 14 on Rome, 11 on Judea, and only 7 on China. The author seems more sure-footed, and more excited, when describing Rome.<br />However, overall I found this a great read, enough so that it inspired to get some of the authors other books.	2001-02-15

I found their speculations generally very persuasive, and the writing is very good.<br />My only quibble is that, as other reviewers have mentioned, the last 1/3 of the book the authors lose their narrow focus and go off on all sorts of speculation involving the druids in general - that part isn't nearly as interesting.<br />If you like this book, the closest analaogy I can recommend is to books describing how much information archaelogists have wrung out of Lucy, the Nariokotome (sp?) boy, etc. - this book reminded me of those.	2001-02-15

A crime occurs, but guilt or innocence quickly loses focus - the suspect becomes a pawn, and each chapter focuses on a different figure (the D.A., the  newspaper editor, the suspect's family, etc.) and how they deal with the  situation. Each chapter is written in the first person, and has a number of  vignettes that, to me, were truly vivid. Thompson's more 'extreme' novels,  like The Getaway, The Killer Inside Me, or Pop. 1280, are better-known, but  I think the quiet power of this book eclipses them all.	1999-12-27
