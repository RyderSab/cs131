Well,I have read the series(and they should be read in order in this case) because it kept coming up as a classic.It is not necessarily a recommendation to me - it usually would involve a lot of thinking :).I have not read this as a religious view - I read it as a fantasy using familiar symbols.I think some parts in it are not going to be correctly understood by younger readers;I do not think I would have understood it.It is very well written,and the ending was unexpected until the last few pages.Well,what can I say - it's a classic!	2001-07-17

Very well written book - whether you like the genre or not.As other reviews mentioned,there is a lot of action,but it's not the focus of the book.I liked the psychological leanings here - Jack Ryan thinking about and dealing with everything,from getting suddenly involved in an assasination attempt,to having to protect his family in US,to his involvement in CIA.I've read a few other books by Clancy,and I think this one is the best - more thorough,with more solid plot.	2001-05-13

I've only read the &quot;Arrows&quot; series(the first and the last),and decided to check out this one.I enjoyed it even more.I like the plot,although reading about Charliss was boring and I did it just to have the background understanding.The characters seem to consistently encounter moral questions,and we see and follow their thought processes while they figure out the answer.At the same time it's nowhere near a boring preachy book,and the suspense builds up.As you can see from my title,Karal was my favorite character there.And him being an ambassador's assistant,and eventually the ambassador in a country that was traditionally Valdemar's enemy - it's interesting!:) It's definitely a good read!	2001-02-19

This is one of my favorite Star Trek books(and I've read well over a hundred of them)!For a Trekkie,this book would be an insight into Uhura,and into the friendship and life of the Enterprize crew.But a non-Trekkie would enjoy it too - although the humor of the crew interactions - Spock,McCoy,Evan - would be missed.I enjoyed reading about both planets of cat-like beings and their cultures,and understanding the Star Trek humor made it even more enjoyable.This book is not the usual fighting or intrigue - just songs and friendship and search for a cure - and evaluating the process of growing up in the process.A good book to read and reread!	2001-01-01

I confess - I never saw the movie.I read this book in translation.It is an easy read;the real thinking and evaluating starts after.The last paragraph gives it a great twist.Let's get to the point - you don't have to believe such a thing could happen to get the message.The message being that if we are lazy and don't think into what we do,and plain don't do much creative (not habitual) action - we degenerate. I believe it is a book worth reading,for the message it contains(and hopefully it will wake us up).I think it would be a good book for a discussion,in schools and anywhere.	2000-12-10

It's interesting,well-written,with unexpected turns and twists.The language is easy,but there are new vocabulary words(not too  many,so there is a chance they'll be looked up).The book has a moral,but it  is not preached,rather it flows out as part of the story.Also,because we  want to know what else will happen to the heroes in the story,everyone will  want to read the next one,thus building an interest in reading.Anyway,it's  a good book and a nice investment in your library(and not only for the  children).	2000-07-02
