I looked forward to turning every page.   I was not so much shocked by it, because I've heard of the O'Neal family volitility, but was more emotionally moved by the raw story Tatum tells.   It just felt more 'real' to me reading in than just 'hearing' about it. <br /> <br />However, I must say that at some points I found the story a bit difficult to follow; finding myself re-reading pages trying to ascertain the time-table.  But that is because she is trying to fit an entire, difficult life, into a few hundred pages.    <br /> <br />Also, I wish she'd gone into more detail about her life with respect to what her everyday life looked like after McEnroe (she says she was given no money, but later says she received a settlement, that confused me).   I wish she would have explained how she funded her true druggie years after having no acting jobs.   And I wish she would have gone into more detail about her recovery.  These are not criticisms... truly her story just completely interests me and I wonder these things.   <br /> <br />All in all, my heart feels for this woman so much.   She's endured so much that I cannot even  begin to understand.	2004-12-05

I hoped I would read a simplier explanation of Lisa's death.

I picked this book up because of it's notoriety of being banned China.  I was expecting some scintillating stuff; but it didn't happen; although the story was well worth reading.  What I learned about banning books in China is this;  China needs more problems to worry about than a fresh story of a modern couple.<br />Coco is a young, educated writer from a supportive family.  She meets and falls desperatly in love with Tian-Tian.  She moves in with him regardless of her parents' unaproving stance... but she stands up as a modern woman in modern day Shanghai.<br />The story revolves around Coco's life; her writing, her tremendous yet torcherous love for the impotent Tian-Tain, and her pull for her 'Western' German lover who fulfills her every physical need.<br />All in all this was a great story full of real life stuff; and the bonus is that it is from a country we cannot understand (Communist China) and yet it is a story we can all relate to.	2003-03-21

The only reason I rated this 3 stars instead of 4 stars is because I've been quite spoiled by reading EJD's other books.  I am a truly, spoiled lady; and EJD made me that way.  He is a woman's (and maybe a man's) novelist god!<br />I really liked the strife in the lead characters' relationship as it was raw and like something we've all felt during our young, heartfelt relationships.  The fact that ex's and children were involved only made the story more real and complex... and more difficult to take sides.    <br />I completely understood Vince's need to protect his child and ex-wife's 'memory' from his new woman, but also understood her frustration with his inability to let go of the past, make her queen, and continue with their own life, together.<br />The dips and turns made this book so real and so worth reading .... it was as if I was reliving parts of my own past.	2003-02-22

This book fell completely flat with me.  I'd read reviews and had received positive personal reviews and so I was really looking forward to cracking the bind!<br />When I began reading it, I liked the mood and was drawn in.   But soon found in very draining with the lack of motion in storyline and the droning on and on from the main characters.  It frankly, became unbearable, and I skimmed the last 40 pages or so, and I hate to do that!<br />On the up side, the story itself has much potential, I just felt the author spent too much on non-dialogue, ie. many, many pages were of the characters' thoughts and memories.  Normally, this doesn't bother me, but in this case, it caused a chasm in the storyline that left me bored.	2002-12-14

I felt like I'd already  understood the book...   It is so much more than what I'd thought. Dolores, an only child of a strained and abusive marriage, tries to comes to terms with her life after he parents divorce.  She misses her Daddy (who was good to her but not to her Mother); the house she lived in and the life she led. She lives thereafter, with her repressed Mother and more-than-represed Grandmother, and she is ridiculed as the 'new kid on the block' in her new town.<br />Dolores doesn't \\"bounce back\\" (as we'd say in modern-day times) from her parent's divorce.  She becomes withdrawn, angry, difficult, and uses food as a comfort.  She grows into an obese, introspective, young woman who later goes through the trauma of  being raped by a family tenant.... all of that exacerbates her alredy sensitive situation.<br />Dolores' painful life experiences continue and make this a moving, and memorable story.  Dolores goes through experiences which are at times, emotionally exhausting, but necessary for her own recovery...This is the kind of book I LOVE:  one that takes you from the very beginning of Life's Journey to the \\"Very Beginning of Life's Journey\\".   A True Full Circle.   Dolores perseveres after struggle, struggle, struggle.<br />An excellent novel!...	2002-10-24

She is sassy, smart, full of one-liners and is continually adding to her 'book' of the Southern Belles Handbook...the more I read, the more I appreciated the story!<br />And what a great one it is!  This book follows Sissy's life as a mother of three, married to a man who is not what she'd hoped, and then along comes an old high-school sweetheart with whom she embarks on a scandoulous 'situation'.  The book then darts back in time when Sissy was in high school and the story deepens and surprises the reader with giddy delight.

I began this book because an unmarried twenty-something friend recommended it; I am a thirty-something married who happens to like to read. Probably the only reason I stuck with this book...<BR>(because I really didn't feel I had anything in common with the story line) was because this story unfolded, grew and was more than it's surface implied. I stuck with it, and am glad that I did. <br />The beginning was chocked full of the stories I've lived ad-nauseum during my 'hey-day' as a single woman. I really didn't have much patience for reliving my 'stupid' days as a single, pondering over men who weren't worth it....<br />But I kept reading and found that this book offered a bit more than I'd expected. It went beyond the 'single angst' as I'd expected. The main character, Cannie Shapiro is a 27 year old writer who, although is a college graduate, does not have the self-esteem to see herself more than 'less than' everyone else. She is overweight, although strong, she's been abondonded by her father, essentially abandoned my her mother who has decided she is a lesbian, and has recently 'lost' her boyfriend, Bruce. <br />The story follows her struggles with all of these issues ... all the while showing Cannie's wit, strength, pain, and growth. All in all, this book was more than a 'Twenty-Something' thing for this 'Thirty-Something' woman.	2002-07-30

I picked this up (from a friend's rec) after reading many serious, family dramas. I love family dramas, which is one reason I loved this book. But this book was different as it offered drama with a huge and colorful flair of humor and sweetness.<br />Daisy Fay was born to two very different people, both natives of Mississippi. She was an only child. This story follows, through her narrative, her life from the time she is about 11 until she is about 18. <br />Daisy Fay doesn't have an easy life, for sure, but she's the best trooper around, excelling with her wit, smarts, and some kind of 'strength she musta beena born with' ... as my Momma would say.<br />This story is chocked full of characters....

To explore the mind of a child who endures so much... physical, emotional and sexual abuse... brings to an adult's eyes sensitivity that is a necesssity in dealing with children.  Reading this book makes me love my daughter even more.  This book made me feel grateful that my daughter is protected and loved.<br />It is a rich and searing novel.

Her books are REAL, lively, and full of life's lessons and hurts.  And although I am white, this family story resonates in my head as my own.   <br />Mama, the mother of five, is a struggling black woman who's lived in near poverty her entire life.  She is strong, opinionated, bossy, with a grit that only comes from living life the hard way, but also has the character to 'want a back yard', shine the windows and keep her babies polite, hard workers and knowin' they got some good in this life.  All of that while she put up with thier Daddy, a boozer and abuser, who Mildred (Mama) finally cuts loose.<br />The story goes on for a couple of decades, with each of her babies lives opening like a flower.

This is my second review of this novel... the first review I wrote got lost in cyber-space.  That in itself should say alot about this book because I really wouldn't take the time to write another review unless the book 'deserved' it.  And this one does.<br />This book was so 'real' that I never felt as though I was picking up a book to read it... I felt as though I was living it.<BR>Terry McMillan has such an extraordinary talent for making characters come alive.... she is truly gifted.<br />This story is about Zora, a twentysomething, college-educated woman who has chosen bad men all along the way (been there, done that).  She is trying to figure out why she's chosen these guys and is determined not to repeat these mistakes.  She is also a talented singer who is determined to 'make it'.<br />Franklin is a father of two ... separated from his wife and is living in a rooming home just trying to get his 'constitution' together.  While he works out, does his woodworking, and struggles to keep a job and pay his child support, he is doing pretty well.  He is smart, charming, talented, big and sexy.  <br />Zora and Franklin meet at the apartment she has just rented in Brooklyn, NY.  He is the laborer working on her floors.  At first their meeting is simple, but as the two continue to get to know each other, an intense and close relationship develops.<br />They fall in love.... and with that comes the story.  So real, so happy, so heart wrenching.  <br />Franklin is a man who you will love and hate at the same time.  He has a huge heart but is burdened by his inability to achieve what he is capable of.  He is constantly reminded of 'the white man's power' and is wounded by his own Mother's lack of love.  This combination is a major negative force for him.  He seems to take one step forward, then two steps backward...  and this eventually turns him into an angry and self-destructive state.<br />But the story continues... as does real life.  That is what is so wonderful about this book.    Real life doesn't always have perfect, or imperfect, endings.  And true love stories never end.	2002-05-17

This author is amazing.  The writing flows so naturally and the characters and their story is so realistic that it wasn't like reading a book at all.<br />The story itself was as good as the writing.  These characters got into my head.  <br />I could relate to Zora's thoughts and personality.  She was a successful, independent woman who'd had a history of choosing loser men (been there, done that).  She feels for Franklin, a sexy, ruggged, bad boy type with natural intelligence and a sweet spot softer than cream.   <br />I could understand Franklin, a down-on-his luck guy who can't seem to catch a break, but a guy who WANTS to catch a break.   He so reminded me of my brother.... a HUGE heart, but can't take one step forward without falling two steps behind.  I also saw in him something I've seen in my brother... that a huge heart and yearning to do right can to turn into extreme anger and self-destruction if those steps backward do not become forward ones.   <br />Sweet, sad, real.... so true to life.  A GREAT book!	2002-05-11

It is chocked full of life.  It is the story of a family and one that covers all of the bases of familial trauma, struggle, heartache, triumph and love.<br />The story takes place in modern day and is so true-to-life that I cannot believe these folks don't exist.  Each chapter is 'written' by an individual of the 'core' family; Viola, the Mama and matriarch; Cecil, the Dad who was so often absent; and their four grown children, Paris, the perfectionist and oldest; Charlotte, the one with a chip on her shoulder; Janelle, the one who flounders in life regardless of her intelligence; and finally, Lewis, the sole brother who is fighting his own personal demons.  <br />This story takes you into their lives and makes you feel like you know each one of them personally.  I laughed and cried, like only a GREAT book can do.	2002-03-10

But that is okay, because this story also brings with it history, emotion, culture, multi-culture, saga, and just plain great story telling.<br />Ruth, the main character and the one who narrates the book is a 46 year old Chinese-American learning to come to grips with her life, including her live-in American boyfriend of 10 years, his two daughters, her career as a ghost writer, and finally, her aging Chinese mother, Lui-Ling.<br />The story grabbed me for several reasons.  One, because I could relate to Ruth as an American, two I could relate to Ruth as an American who feels 'different', and three, the journey this book takes you on is like one of an exoctic vacation... to China.  However, this China is not present day, it is China during the early 1900's when Ruth's Mother, Liu Ling was growing up.<br />All of these subjects within the story line propelled me to read this story faster than most books I read.  I am so very fascinated with family saga, relationships, and ultimately how our history affects who we are today.  This book did it all for me and I recommend it highly.	2002-02-27

While I enjoyed the book, I really didn't think it was as great as I expected after reading many of the reviews. <br />What bothered me was that the main character, Fran seemed very difficult to 'see'.  I just couldn't figure out who she was as a person.  Perhaps that is because abused women lose themselves, but I still do not know.  I had a very clear picture of her abusive husband; the macho NYC Police Officer named Bobby Benedetto.  <br />The other thing that bothered me is the main characters' (Fran) incessant mental rehashing of what seemed to be way-out there thoughts, ie. how her 10 year old sons lanky body seemed to be made of tinker toys... huh?  It was if she was on a wild mind trip the entire book.  Her thoughts would spill out from one thing to the other and very often I found myself lost in her mind.  <br />All in all, however, I did enjoy it and would recommend it, although not as highly as some other reviewers would.	2002-02-12

It is a very simple and short story of a man and woman who are married, almost out of convenience, who are secure and happy, but perhaps not \\"in love\\".  It is apparent though, that they do love each other and find great comfort with each other.<br />They are country folk and the story surrounds their life together as the wife is dying of cancer.  Although that sounds like a downer, her cancer and dying is not the focal point of the book as the story line dips back into the past and meanders about.<br />Many characters and stories and introduced, yet in a simple and short-storied way.<br />Very nice short read!	2002-01-25

Even though this book is supposed to be read before The Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, I read it afterward; like most folks.  In any event, it was a good book and I recommend it, however....<br />I was hoping for more insight. Again, I read it after the YaYas had already enveloped my psyche.  I was a die hard YaYa and wanted more.  This book, although very good on its own, made me feel like I still wanted more.   And I'd hoped it would have answered more questions about ViVi, Shep, Sidda, and the lot.  <br />What I really like is that every family/friend/character had his/her own chapter.  From that you could reason and view their own perspective of this wonderful family story.	2002-01-15

It tells the story of two sisters who are struggling with modern-day problems such as HIV, family loss, cocaine addiction, maternal love, and falling in love.<br />I picked up this book and didn't put it down until over 100 pages had passed.  I loved the characters; Ava, the younger sister who'd fled the family town for bigger and better things only to come home after discovering she has AIDS.  Her older sister, Joyce, a strong, loving woman who is determined to pass on positive vibes to the young town-folk who are slowly succubming to ignorance, crack, anger, and nothingness.

It is no longer acceptable to call our brown-skinned relatives 'hogs'; but it is still easier, unfortunately, to accept the death penalty when a man's skin is dark.  This made me realize how much more we have to change.<br />Jefferson was an innocent black man accused of murder in the south during the 1940's.  We can all determine his fate from that; not good.  A family friend is sent, unwillingly, to counsel Jefferson in his last days in jail.  Jefferson is uncommunicative and his 'teacher' frustrated.  In time, however, they come to terms with each other and the situation at hand.<br />A simple story that is heart-wrenching, full of American history, and most importantly a 'great lesson'.	2002-01-04

It tells a simple story spanning a period of only about 2 years.  The detail of their exhaustive efforts to survive as well as their mundane tasks of everyday life did not leave me bored as I would have expected, but left me wanting more with every page.  I felt an extreme sense of respect for my ancestors, as life as we know it now, is a piece of cake compared to life 100 years ago.<br />I truly enjoyed learning all of the details of cooking a meal with no running water, no gas stove, no coffee maker or microwave.  The details about the surrounding beauty of the mountains in their natural state astounded me.  I learned so much I cannot even say .... whoever heard of creesie greens, sugartit and konkajohn?<br />A wonderful novel that left me with much to think about and much to be thankful for... funny I finished reading it just before Thanksgiving.	2001-11-21

I immensly enjoyed every part of this wonderful book.  The only reason I do not rate it 5 stars is because I reserve that rating for only a select few and although this book was terrific, the ending was a bit too brief for me.<br />However, the entire story line was tremendous.  The outward layer of the story is about a 40 year old woman, Siddalee Walker, who is not only doing 'research' for her next directorial project, but also trying to come to terms with her childhood, specifically, her relationship with her mother, Vivi.   The 'research' and emotional reflection Siddalee endures come together as one giant project, which become the basis and true story of this book.<br />The real story flashes back into Siddalee's Mother's childhood, adolescence, and adult life as a young mother with four children.  The stories are rooted in the extreme bond Vivi has with the Ya Ya's, Caro, Necie and Teensy.  Here is where the story blossoms with the fun and frolic of youth and also with the sentiment of female bonds, which I believe is the essential message of this book.  <br />You will not only enjoy the joyride of exploring a bygone era (30's, 40's, 50's) but will also come away with a renewed and sweeter vision of your own Mother and Girlfriends.	2001-11-13

Books	3	1	1	N	N	A Story With Potential But Too Fragmented	I began reading this story and was immediately drawn to it's 'darker side'.  The main character, Dena Nordstrom, was portrayed as a hopeless, helpless, New Yorker whose life surrounded parties, alcohol, and celebrity.  Quickly, however, the story changes ... to describe Dena's roots.  I always love that type of story telling, but in this case, the original picture never resurfaces which felt like I never came full-circle with understanding Dena (or the book).<br />This is the story of an abandoned woman's life; a woman who becomes successful regardless of the pain and lack of familia support.   That part is inspiring, and sweet, especially since her extended family just about defines the meaning &quot;Mayberry&quot;.<br />While this book came out to be sweet-smelling and gave 'warm fuzzies' in the end, it still left so many open ended story lines.  At least for me, and I like a good 'warm fuzzy' novel. This one just didn't finish all of the loose ends.	2001-10-30

What a struggle.<BR>I was immediately drawn to the story line as well as the characters in it. I was also very disturbed by it. I have by no means been sheltered, but this story still made my soul hurt.<BR>Many reviewers said it was &quot;funny&quot;... perhaps I don't have a good sense of humor because I didn't find anything about this story funny. I found it very sad, very memorable, and very worth reading.	2001-09-13

The beginning described in minute detail the landscape surrounding the Mulvaney home. In my humble opinion only a very few authors can get away with such detail without completely boring their reader.<BR>Despite that, I kept reading the book and have to say that I finished it. The fact that I finished it was a miracle because I couldn't wait for it to end since at every reading session I became exhausted of the re-iteration of storyline. However, having finished the book despite my frustrations with it says much about the story at hand. If you want a family story that portrays the good stuff as well as shows the bad stuff, this is the book for you. Plus, this is a book we can all relate to. However, as I've said, it dragged on a bit too much for me.<BR>In short, it is a great story of a very interesting and familiar-like family, but much too drawn out. I would have LOVED it if it were 200 pages shorter.	2001-08-31

It had promise of a dark family story with plenty to grab hold of and to sink your teeth into.  I was very excited about this book in the first 75 or so pages but then quickly lost my passion for its story.   <br />That isn't to say it was not worth reading.  It certainly was, it just didn't make it 'round to home base.  The story, of a young married woman with two children in the early seventies who is forced to give up her home to live with her in-laws when her husband is unable to find work, is certainly one that most of us can relate to.  The frustration, the disappointment, the difficulty in turning your life over to anothers home.  This home, especially since her in-laws were stoic, rigid and miserably disfunctional.  <br />The story of her husbands family unfolds, not like a beautiful budding rose, but like a rose in a garden devourerd by beetles. Each petal that opens, shows it rotten, hole-filled, disease stricken self, culminating in a garden of what can only be weeds that nearly strangle those few innocents left.  And this can be sickening when you see it in the sun light.   <br />What turned me off was that there was little relief of this suffering.  I kept wanting to scream, &quot;GET OUT&quot;, &quot;Get the f--- out&quot;, but it didn't do any good.   Even though in the end, the young wife does get out, didn't seem to feel as if it would matter.  And as usual, dysfunction breeds dysfunction.	2001-07-28

It was always such a treat and a virtual history lesson to hear of their experiences as youngsters.    <br />This book parallels those stories for me because it is of a bygone era told from a woman who has since aged.  What a wonderful tale and what great lessons we can learn from our elders.  <br />Chiyo, or Sayuri as we later come to know her, tells the story of her life from childhood on the seacoast of Japan where she grew-up, through the time when she was sold by her father into what would now be considered slavery, and then into adolescence, adulthood and beyond.  This is a story that envelops you in a way that makes you feel as if you are there, and more, that you want to be there.<br />This story is about the story.  Not the beginning, not the middle, nor the end.  The whole story.<br />I developed a deep interest in Asian culture after reading this novel as I am sure many other people have.  This was an eye-opening literary experience for me.	2001-05-28

Everyone raved about this book. I began reading it with hopes of reading a wonderful novel that would leave me feeling satisfied. I wasn't. <br />I can't quite understand my feelings; I can just say that part of me loved this book and part of me didn't. Ruth grew on me as a person and I loved who she was. I just found it difficult to figure out what she was all about. Was she retarded, slow, or normal with a repressive Mother? I realize &quot;retarded&quot; is politically incorrect, and I understand and respect why. However, the reason I use it here is because the alternative term, &quot;mentally challenged&quot;, definitely applies to Ruth. But to what degree? And why? What was the cause? Her small town upbringing, her living in the shadow of her brilliant younger brother, her sensitivity?<br />Somehow you get the feeling, she was &quot;normal&quot;, but perhaps not. Even still, it was frustrating for me not to understand the root, and precisely, who she was and what her problems were.<br />I also could not &quot;see&quot; her Mother May. Another reviewer said the same thing and I understand completely. May was a major force in this book, and a major influence in Ruth's life, but I just couldn't get a good picture of who she was either!!! Another odd thing is that you never even here the name &quot;Ruth&quot; throughout the book. You don't even think of 'Ruth' as Ruth. <br />I thought of her as this young woman who was given no opportunities in life and who was repressed by her overbearing Mother. She was strong, but may be not strong enough. This book does not give you the answers on a silver platter and perhaps that is the beauty of this story. You are drawn in and become emotionaly attached to these non-entities.<br />I was very frustrated with the ending. Ruth, who persevered through so much, just seemed to crumble, probably with good reason though. But still, I hated that. That doesn't mean tosay that Ruth doesn't succeed, she probably will, you just don't get that satisfaction here. <br />Still, I ended the book feeling very emotional, and perhaps that in itself says alot about this story. To feel so emotional about characters you do not completely know or understand and yet still feel for, is quite remarkable. And that is why I have such mixed feelings; my head is stil spinning on this one.<br />I feel as if I only scratched the surface of a very deep story... yet I still feel moved.	2001-04-18

She is as fresh, outwardly, as any 11 year old can be.  She marvels about her summers at the lake front community where she lives, her appreciation of nature, her girl-like adoration for her mother, her protective love for her little brother.  One has visions of 50's and 60's television shows where everyone is scrubbed clean with white teeth, perfectly pressed pinafores and curly hair.  <br />It doesn't take long, however, to realize that Allie has another, darker, life in which she lives.  One that is secret, and one that she actively participates in keeping status quo.<br />Allie's father is a successful attorney who works many hours, who is a bit &quot;upper crust&quot;, and who is a raging, abusive alcoholic.  Her older brother, obviously affected by his upbringing, is a constant negative force in Allie's life continually taunting and threatening her.  <br />Allie is strong and through the craziness, she perseveres and becomes well trained in keeping it all together.  She placates, she entertains, she babysits, she acts as lookout.  She is the caretaker of all, including becoming the enabler of her mother's extramarital affair, all of this while she is just a child.  That in itself makes this a very sad book.  <br />The writing is difficult to get used to as it is written from an 11 year old's perspective, however, once you get the rhythm, you soon hear an almost poetic sound in Allie's voice.  <br />All in all, this book is about the story, not the ending.  It looks behind the doors of the family next door and uncovers what you'd never expect.	2001-04-03

I initally purchased it because I have family members who have ties to heroin and so I wanted an inside peek into this secretive world.  Well, this book gave me that peek, however, it still didn't supply my need to understand &quot;why&quot;.  <br />Gia's life seemed very typical to me; it was riddled with painful life altering traumas, the kind we all experience.  Dysfunction, divorce, adolescent anxst.  The differece with Gia, however, was that she became a supermodel.  Is this what made her a heroin addict?  I really don't know, but I really don't think so. This book does not answer that question.  That in itself was frustrating.  WHY?<br />It was frustrating to see her completely destruct.  <br />I am not sure that the author had a complete idea of Gia's family life as he wrote about them as if they were complacent sideliners one minute and the next minute it was if they were loving, supportive caregivers.  Perhaps they were both.  I guess that is what it is like trying to live with drug addicted family members.  <br />In summary, this book is more about drug addiction and the sadness it cultivates than any 'glamour' related story of a model gone bad.  <br />Be prepared to feel sad, and numb, when you finish this book.	2001-03-25

This is an unbelievable book. <br />I am not an Anne Rice fan.  I've never read any of her other books and I was very put off by the extreme volume of this novel; it is close to 1,000 pages.  And small print at that.  <br />But I picked it up and began to read... the next thing I knew I was enveloped into a world in which I couldn't stand to exit.  I was completely taken and enthralled with everything about it; the family history, the seediness, the beauty, the filth, the eery, the antiquity.  <br />It was just superb.  I even named my angel fish Stella and Lasher.<br />As far as Anne Rice as the author goes - I cannot believe reincarnation does not exist after reading this book!

It touched me to watch the young  Astrid struggle to keep her mother close, only later to push her so far away.  I found the intricacies of their relationship to be fairly typical in that although it was a painful one, their bond was undeniably strong. The sordid details of what inevitably sends Astrid's mother to jail were eerily titillating.  And finally, and for me the most interesting and moving parts of the book were the many different lives Astrid has to live while being bounced from foster home (trauma) to foster home (trauma).  What keeps this book on a high note though, is that despite the turbulence and pain, we learn that Astrid survives and that life goes on.	2001-03-22

It was fascinating to read of the gradual decline of Scott &quot;Hollywood&quot; Scurlock's (the books main character) morals and limits.  Although he was repeatedly described as charming and movie-star like, I found him to be a shifty, gross creep (for lack of more colorful words); he made my skin crawl.

Maybe I shouldn't even write a review on this book since I couldn't finish it.  But I suppose that in itself says something.  While many people have loved this book, I could not bring myself, night after night, to read what seemed to be the same depressing, mundane, dwelling of the main characters issues over and over and over and over again.	2001-03-19

I was somewhat ambivalent about my pregnancy for  many reasons, one of which was because I  had never planned on having  children.  I just wasn't into all of this &quot;baby love&quot; stuff that  many other women are.  Well I read, and read, and read all of these  pregnancy books and just got more and more depressed.  I just couldn't  relate to any of it; I needed the &quot;real deal&quot; in straight up,   non-sugar-coated, words.  <br />Well, then my girlfriend sent me this book and  I was  thrilled.  Finally I'd found a book, and a mind-set, that I could  relate to, and with that, I comfortably settled into my pregnancy.   Vicki  Iovine discusses very frankly and humorously everything about the  feelings  and changes of pregnancy.  It is very personably written and I found every  last page engaging.  <br />This is an emotional book, not a text book, and  that is precisely what is so good about it.	2000-08-18

I felt very interested and comforted in  reading another family's struggle with a family members' illness.  I enjoyed reading of  Nick's childhood and of the &quot;signs&quot; of illness that were present  at even a young age.  I read this book very quickly as it did captivate me.   On the down side, I felt Danielle Steel repeated herself alot and wish she  had gone in to a bit more detail of her son's specific behavior.	2000-03-10

It is a good example of how cruel life can be but how the human spirit can  thrive beyond adversity.  Very sweet story.	2000-03-10

I absolutely adored that book; it was funny but realistic.  So when my due date began to approach, I was thrilled to purchase this book and start reading.  Well,  what a mistake!   This book contains all the &quot;real dirt&quot; of  baby/motherhood, true.  But in this case, I think that too much honesty (or  is it too much whining) can be detrimental.  The author drones on and on  about the negatives (I think there is one up-beat chapter about baby-love)  and frankly, I was flat out depressed after every reading session.  <br />This  book scared me to death and had me convinced (and not in a joking/funny  way) that I would not sleep, eat, bathe or leave the house for months after  the baby was born, all the while being dressed in stained, ragged clothes  while my husband regularly wanted gourmet dinners served on time!  Not a  pretty picture for a first-time Mom who has no idea what to expect, and who  is already feeling scared and vulnerable.	2000-01-27
