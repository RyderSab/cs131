My son just loved the rhyming text of this book when he was about 2-5 years old.  Also there is a lot of detail in the pictures, so parent and child can spend time counting the umbrellas or finding the bee in the picture. When my son outgrew it, I gave it to a friends' 2-yr-old, and they told me she loved it too.  Then I started teaching 2 and 3-yr-olds and I had to find a copy again.... luckily I was able to find a second hand copy, and I enjoyed reading it to the preschoolers today.  One kept interrupting because she wanted to point out things in the pictures.  I think it's a hard-to-find combination of good rhyming text, and illustrations that are artistic (collage-style) and not too cutsey.  I like the mole that is underground and oblivious to the weather (as are the fish)!	2005-01-28

The facing page gives a brief description of each species including its size, habits, habitat and geographic area of the US in which it is found.  I was surprised to find that, in addition to birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles, the book also covers fish, plants, and insects.  It is great for the amateur naturalist who just wants to find out what kind of lizard or owl he/she saw on a hike.  There is not a lot of information on each animal because that would make the book too heavy to lift (it is a field guide after all)!  And of course some varieties had to be left out, for instance, with hundreds of kinds of spiders in the US they could not show all of them and kept it down to one page.  I was a wee bit disappointed not to find a large caterpillar that I had hoped to identify.  Someone who was particularly interested in one type of wildlife might want a second guide to expand on, for instance, butterflies or wildflowers.  Overall, it is an attractive and helpful book to have on hand to identify wildlife.	2004-10-09

I checked several books out of the library on this subject, but this is the only one I read cover to cover.  It is a breeze to read.  The writer adds examples from her own experience which are interesting and keep it from being a dry how-to book.  The tips are very straightforward and useful.  Maybe some of the steps are common sense, such as cleaning and de-cluttering the house for sale, but she adds some extra tips, such as the best place to quickly stash your junk mail &amp; other clutter before a showing (where won't they look?).  Many of the tips focus on less obvious aspects of selling, such as what wording to look out for before signing a listing contract.  I appreciate the fact that the author recommends honesty to home sellers - fix or disclose problems with the house rather than covering them up.  Most home inspectors will find everything anyway, and a seller who seems to be hiding something will raise red flags with buyers.  I found it to be an enjoyable and helpful book.	2004-03-10

Want to plan a vegetarian or vegan Thanksgiving spread?  You're in the right book.  Even if you are not cooking, the book is a pleasure to read and browse through because it explains the origins of vaious holidays and the foods that are made to celebrate them.  The recipes are organized by season and by holiday (multi-cultural holidays such as Hannukah, Ramadan, and Christmas, as well as Fourth of July and Father's Day BBQ).  There are tasteful illustrations and helpful hints about how to plan a meal so that everything arrives hot at the table.  My only qualm is that many of recipes look as if they might take a long time to make; although there is an index for 30-minutes-or-less cooking.	2003-11-14

Anyone who has any interest in the phenomenon of child prodigies will find this book a fascinating read.  It traces the early development of 6 children who are prodigies (able to work competitively at the adult level) in some field.  Of the 6, the fields the children excel in are as follows: 2 are in chess, 1 is a writer, 1 a musician, 1 in mathematics, 1 is extremely gifted overall (one of the highest IQs recorded).  The author explains why prodigies are more often found in some fields, such as music or chess, than others (such as writing- the writing prodigy was the only 1 of the 6 children studied who was not working at an adult professional level).  The author delves into the \\"coincidences\\" of time, place, technology and parenting that allow these prodigies to develop.  He draws on other examples of prodigies outside of his own 6 subjects.  Among these is  a severely handicapped youth who, through the dedication of his adoptive parents, was eventually discovered to have savant ability in music.  Some may argue that one or the other child in the study may not be a true prodigy, but they are all interesting children to read about, and the author certainly makes some excellent observations on the development of human potential.  I found this book hard to put down.	2003-06-05

This book could have benefited from better editing- it has a lot of typos, some incomplete sentences, and at one point two paragraphs are repeated almost word-for-word in two different chapters.  It is, however, an interesting case study of an exceptionally gifted child and the family who raised him.   Parents seeking advice from other parents of gifted children might find this book hard to put down, but I think they could find better resources by starting with \\"Smart Boys\\" or \\"Smart Girls\\" by Barbara Kerr, or the books \\"Re-forming Gifted Education\\" and \\"Stand Up for Your Gifted Child.\\"	2003-06-05

I found this book very helpful when planning preschool art classes with plenty of paper bags available.  Paper bags are cheap and recycle-friendly, which makes them ideal for class projects.  This book has lots of fun ideas for making art and crafts projects, such as maraccas and wreaths.  I think the ideas can be adapted for children of almost any age, 2 and up (for 2-year-olds, an adult can form the base, such as a wreath, from a paper bag and let the child decorate it with glued on things or paint...)

If you will be driving through Ireland, this is the book for you.  Many other books are not necessarily geared for driving trips, but this one has maps and driving directions for all areas of Ireland.  It also tells you how long it will take to get from A to B, which is hard to predict even when you know the mileage, due to differing road conditions.  Plus the book is full of color photography and color maps which makes it more pleasurable to read and browse through.

This was the book we used most when traveling around Ireland in 2001.  We found it had just the right amount of information, not too much, not too little.  It is designed for at-a-glance reading, with a convenient spiral binding and color maps on both end flaps.  Each part of Ireland gets a &quot;in 3 days&quot; list of must-see attractions, well illustrated with color photographs, followed by a list of &quot;at your leisure&quot; activities for those who have more time or particular interests.  Hotels, B&amp;Bs and restaurants are included for each region, though these lists are limited.  Then there is a section on &quot;practicalities&quot; - money, how to use phones, etc..., and even some history is thrown in.  We found that this book helped us get around without having to wade through a lot of extraneous text.  We plan to use it again this year to see the rest of Ireland.	2003-03-15

If you do not have any of MaryAnn Kohl's books, this will be a good resource for working with very young children.  However if, like me, you already own several of Kohl's other books (Scribble Art, Global Art, Preschool Art, etc.) you might not need this one.  I found that many of the ideas overlapped those in her other books.  There was not a lot of new material here that I could not have adapted from Scribble Art (my favorite of her books, which can be adapted for all ages) or Preschool Art.  The ideas in this book do allow for a lot of creative exploration, which cannot be said of a lot of other childrens' art books (many are more concerned with cute results than the child's experience).  For that reason I would recommend this author's books very highly, just not necessarily this one!	2002-10-09

Instead of throwing these things away, we can give the children a creative art/ recycling experience!

First off, this book is mistakenly categorized under age range of \\"baby-preschool\\" - the book clearly reads \\"age 4 and up\\" on the back.  This is a nifty kit for drawing funny cartoon people using thumb prints.  There is a little stamp pad and pen and a spiral flip book.  The page flips up so that on top is a demonstration page showing how to make a thumb print into a muscle man, or someone half-under water, or Frankenstein- then there is a blank page underneath so the child (or child-at-heart) can try it.  The book is small and would be good for kids who are traveling.  I bought it for a boy who is reluctant to draw and I thought this might peak his interest.	2002-09-27

This book is an excellent reference for a beginner or experienced art facilitator.  (The introduction explains how to be an art \\"facilitator\\" rather than teacher, by providing the materials and opportunity for children to discover art hands-on, though practice and experience.)  It is wonderful guide to the basic methods of collage, drawing, painting, clay and construction techniques, as well as more specialized projects, such as paper mache puppets, making \\"molas\\" or weaving.  The author learned to perfect these projects through many years of experience with her Summertime Arts and Crafts Workshop.  Many black and white illustrations and some line drawings help illuminate the techniques and reveal the end products of childrens' art.  I like the page spread of photos showing childrens' many variations on the paper mache puppet.  This is one of my favorite art reference books.	2002-07-28

All of Mary Ann Kohl's art books are great, but if you have to start with just one, I would get this one.  In fact, if you are teaching art to young children or working with your own child artists at home, this would be an ideal book to start with.  Why?  It covers all the mediums: drawing, painting, assemblage, printmaking, collage, sculpture and crafts.  It contains open-ended projects that are suitable for almost any age.  The projects allow children to explore materials and techniques and come up with their own ideas.  Each page includes one project and is illustrated with line drawings.  Each project is coded to show at a glance how much time/preparation is needed, what age/experience level the project is appropriate for, and so forth.  My only complaint is that some of the projects call for the use of liquid starch which I have not been able to find (only spray starch and powder starch) - so I substitute watered down glue, which works.  I teach art, am an art school graduate and a parent, and I have quite a few books on this subject, but this is the book I turn to most for ideas.	2002-06-01

This book focuses on introducing the basic art mediums (painting, drawing, printmaking, collage, clay, construction) for children ages 5 -10.  The author emphasizes the importance of letting children work with these basic mediums repeatedly until they have gained mastery of the materials.  Gradually they become more expressive in their work. The author encourages children to use their own life experience as a guide for making art; she discusses how to talk with children about their art, which is important to their own perceptions of their art. The book is written from the perspective of one person's experience as an art teacher and what she learned along the way. (I loved the photographs of the childrens' art.)  The author adds tips for parents who want to do art at home with their kids.  One quibble: she suggests letting children work in acrylic paint at home without mentioning that acrylics are not washable or nontoxic, unlike tempera paints.  Many will enjoy reading this art teacher's experiences and advice, as I did, but be advised that the book is about a slow gradual approach to learning fine arts rather than a quick project idea reference.	2002-05-29

It is intended for older children, say 12-15 or so, but most adults will learn a thing or two here, and it is suitable to read aloud to younger children.  Through glimpses into the lives of the White House children, the reader learns about history from the 1700s to the present.

As an artist and parent who now teaches art to young children, I think this book has some cute craft ideas but is not the best introduction to art for children.  I prefer Scribble Art by Mary Ann Kohl - it has a similar easy-to-read format with projects that can be adapted to almost any age, but Scribble Art  involves more open-ended projects that allow for creativity and self-expression.  Little Hands is more results oriented - for instance, if you want to make a quick turtle using a plastic bowl, this book will show you how.  Many of projects involve a specific end result - a representational image of a pumpkin or porcupine.  Granted, there are times for this; however, I prefer an approach to allows children to create their own subject matter, or explore freely within a given material or technique.	2002-05-25

The author has produced a moving and well documented book that serves history while respecting and memorializing the individual people who gave the town its spirit.

I wish I had had this book when my child was two.  It guides the reader through the mysterious world of children's art.  Basically, Striker explains that preschool children should not be &quot;taught&quot; art; rather, they should be allowed to experiment avidly with art materials.  When given the opportunity, children use art materials to express themselves and pass through stages of mark-making that are vital to later reading and writing skills.  My only complaint about this book is that Striker makes such a strong case against interfering with the natural learning process by, for example, suggesting imagery or otherwise rushing a child into the next stage of development, that it is guilt-inspiring for those of us who made some of these mistakes in the past. However, she gives the reader many concrete suggestions for appropriate art activities so that we can make up for lost time.  They include the five basic art techniques: painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, and collage.  The author explains how these mediums can be presented so as to promote the child's own discovery process.  This is a very valuable book for parents, care takers, and educators.	2001-10-25

This set does indicate on the box that it is for ages 8 and up, and I bought it for a seven-and-a-half-year old.  He desperately wanted a robot kit and I couldn't find one for kids under 8.  So I can't really complain that it was complicated for him and he needed a lot of help putting one of the robots together.  He did enjoy the book very much; in fact he is under the bedcovers reading it with a flashlight as I type.  This kit has big &quot;wow&quot; appeal at first glance.  The little pieces require patience to sort. A big plus: the step-by-step instructions are printed on sturdy colorful cards that are much easier to manipulate than pages in a book. The resulting robot is a bit flimsy and doesn't &quot;eat&quot;  things like it's supposed to, but it did satisfy my son's desire to build a robot.	2001-10-21

It's almost eerie that this book appeared September 2001, just as Americans are reeling with shock after senseless terrorist attacks killed thousands of civilians.  Rabbi Kushner's books have comforted me in the past, and I was glad to see this new one published just when we need it.  Kushner writes with insight about the inner human struggle between what we know is right or good and the self-serving impulses that tempt us.  He writes about the desire for revenge and the morality of justice and forgiveness.  The author quotes from various religious texts as well as world literature, mythology, and history to explore themes of the conscience.  He manages to articulate moral issues with remarkable insight and wisdom, and without being teachy-preachy. The book deals with weighty issues but is a breeze to read.  I recommend it to anyone struggling to understand his/her own conscience and those of other humans.	2001-09-19

This book has very concrete information, product names and contact numbers and addresses of companies that do not contribute to animal cruelty.  Armed with the PETA guide, anyone can go into the supermarket or drug store and know which brands of shampoo or roll-on were manufactured without needless cruelty to animals. I recommend it to everyone who wants to take one easy step toward living a more compassionate life.	2001-09-18

As the authors of this book point out, butterflies and hummingbirds add beauty to the garden.  In my opinion, a garden made to sustain these interesting creatures is more than just pretty - it gives something back to nature.  This guide describes how to attract butterflies and hummingbirds and provide essentials to keep them around. It offers many practical tips as well as background information on the species.  The guide includes charts of plants which will attract and sustain hummers and butterflies throughout their lifespans, suggested garden designs, and an encyclopedia of hummingbird and butterfly species.  It does not include a color photographs of each plant, but those can easily be found elsewhere.  If you would like to devote a whole garden to hummers or butterflies, or just incorporate a few plants to attract them, this book is a good starting place and reference.	2001-08-01

For those who live in cold climates, or those who want to be assured of some year-round interest from their plantings, this is a good source of ideas.  The Winter Garden lists (with many color photographs) plants of all types and sizes which remain interesting in winter for their color, shape, berries, or texture. It's a good book to read for gardeners who are suffering from let down when the blooming season passes.  I found this bit of advice useful: plan any landscape as if it were a winter landscape. Then you will be assured of some beauty all year, and even more so when the flowers do finally pop up.  Also, plant an evergreen shrub and maybe some ornamental grass (or Christmas ferns) in the center of a garden bed; colorful annuals and perennials can surround this when weather permits.	2001-07-26

I bought this book because I adore &quot;Gardening with Native Wildflowers&quot; by the same authors.  I was a little disappointed because this one is not as reader friendly for beginners such as myself.        It does fill an important niche by identifying all native shrubs and woody vines of the southeast, as the title implies, and for this I imagine it would be a must for anyone compiling a serious library and/or study on the subject of native plants.        The book is chock full of color photographs, each of which is labeled by the scientific name of the plant.  However, I would have liked to see the common name there also (there is a common name index).  A beginner who does not need to know about or identify a wide variety of shrubs and vines might be better off starting with a general guide to natural gardening that includes a variety of plant types.	2001-07-24

This one is a pleasure to read and taught me a lot about identification and gardening uses of native wildflowers of the southeast and northeast.  It's the first book I grab to look up a species.  Lots of full color photographs have made it much easier for me to identify the plants I want at the nursery.   The two authors are coming from different perspectives - one has a natural meadow/woodlands landscape and the other uses native plants in a more controlled garden setting along with exotics.  Between the two of them, the reader gets a balanced idea of the possibilities of introducing native flowers to their own yards.  I only wish the index combined scientific names with common names, rather than having two separate indexes.  It would also be convenient if the plant photos were on the same pages as the descriptions.  But those are minor criticisms of an overall superb book.	2001-07-24

I originally checked this book out of the library but I want to buy one because it is so beautiful and useful.  I will return to it again and again as I choose new plants for the yard and plan the garden.  The book has suggested garden layouts for each area of the country, listing recommended flowers, shrubs, and trees for each area.  It identifies birds common to each area and which foods each species prefers.  It is lavishly illustrated.  I particularly appreciate the color photographs of plants, which makes it a lot easier to spot them at the nursery.  I've learned a lot about both birds and plants from this book.	2001-07-22

It also details various feeders and nesters that can be used in yards and shows how to make them yourself.  It is pleasant to read as a chapter book, not just a &quot;how-to&quot;.

This book includes color photographs of the current gardens at Monticello and black &amp; white reproductions of Thomas Jefferson's own sketched plans for the gardens.  There is an annotated list of the flowers and &quot;woody ornamentals,&quot; such as roses and shrubs, grown by Jefferson.  There are many excerpts from his writing and letters which give the reader a greater sense of Jefferson's broad intellect and love of nature as it relates to his gardens.  I was hoping to find a list of flowers native to Virginia cultivated by Jefferson but, while the origins of many of the flowers are indicated, there is no separate list of the native plants as I had hoped.	2001-07-12

This book is a wonderful way to explore the similarities and differences among fairy tales of different countries.  Some classic themes emerge - such a childless couple whose prayers are answered when they receive a child from an unusual source (such as a peach, in the title story).  Or Silly Saburo, who takes all instructions too literally, like a Japanese Amelia Bedelia.  Then there are some delightfully bizarre and unique tales, such as The Magic Teakettle, in which the teakettle is really a talented and lucky badger in disguise, or The Long-Nosed Goblins, whose noses can travel for miles to search out good smells.  The illustrations, some color and some black &amp; white, are charming and bring the endearing characters to life.  I would recommend this book for children 4 - 8 (and adults who can't resist).	2001-07-11

I checked this book out from the library and we enjoyed it so much we had to buy one.  This book contains simple eco-friendly ideas anyone can try, such as making a bird house out of a milk carton, planting a garden to attract butterflies and other creatures, how to avoid overuse of styrofoam and other non-recyclable materials.  It does not suggest major lifestyle changes, just small changes that can add up over time.  And it is fun to read!  It contains mini-quizes for kids on each topic, such as: which of the following will a worm not eat- vegetables, dirt, or steak?(answer= worms don't eat meat). Each idea includes a question &amp; answer, a description of the concept (such as recycling), a few projects to try at home (such giving old toys to charity or having a yard sale instead of throwing them out), and addresses to write to for more information (such as the National Wildlife Federation, which can help you plan a custom made wildlife-friendly yard).  Great, simple projects for kids - a grown-ups too.  I am going to buy the sequel as well and look forward to reading it cover-to-cover.	2001-06-22

If you love James Marshall's &quot;George and Martha&quot; stories but your child is outgrowing them, you can find similar humor in chapter book style in &quot;Rats on the Roof.&quot;  The stories are all about animals and their goofy dilemmas.  There is a sheep who gets into big trouble by pretending to read when he can't (he thinks a &quot;DANGER - Beware of Wolves&quot; sign reads &quot;welcome to the pretty green park&quot;).  And there is an owl who has to defend her tree from a hungry brontosaurus (who said only meat eating dinosaurs are dangerous?)...  Marshall's funny illustrations add to the pleasure of the tales.  &quot;Rats on the Roof&quot; is clean, lighthearted reading.	2001-06-04

The poems are divided into subjects of childhood, maturity and old age.  Some of the translations are not my favorites, but others I do prefer.  The book is a good introduction to haiku because it contains many of the great masters of haiku as well as other noteworthy works by anonymous poets.	2001-04-11

There are stories about how the earth was formed from out of the sea, or how mankind came to life.  My favorite is about why animals and people are mortal, while rocks are not!  The illustrations are subtle and charming - they don't jump out and grab you, but create a dreamy portrait of these mysterious worlds.  This is a nice book for children who are outgrowing picture books, but still enjoy a good illustrated collection.  It offers a quick education in the legends of various cultures.	2001-03-13

Each page has one of Aesop's fables told briefly enough for a small child to digest, and in simple language that is easy to read out loud.  There are many versions of Aesop, of course.

Even though I was surprised that the &quot;gifts and talents&quot; the title refers to are in areas such as &quot;sense of humor&quot; and &quot;social consciousness,&quot; I tried to appreciate the book anyway.  After all, it is true that all children have some &quot;gift&quot; or area of excellence, whether it is in an academic area or not.  However, I found the book dull and lacking in useful advice.

Read about an Aladdin that is closer to the original, and also  about Alibaba and the Forty Thieves, and The Enchanted Garden, two other  stories from The Arabian Nights.  There is some violence here - but, hey,  it's classic literature and it keeps the kids' attention.  There are two  interesting heroic women in the stories.  This gorgeously illustrated book  is printed on good-quality glossy paper, a rare find at this price.

While reading this book aloud to a six-year-old, who had picked it out, I learned a lot about this man, Houdini, who has become a legend.  In a  classic biography format, this book takes us through Houdini's childhood as  a son of poor immigrants who admires acrobats in the cirus and makes up his  own act.  As a young man, he gets work as a locksmith and learns how to  pick any lock... a talent that would come in very handy!  Throughout his  adulthood, Houdini worked incredibly hard to make a name for himself;  sadly, his hard-earned fame indirectly led to his untimely death.   Houdini's story is one of perseverence rather than glamour and stardom.   The book has a serious tone for a childrens' book; even the illustrations  are somber, but it is interesting and well worth a read.	2000-08-18

This kids' version of the popular Dorling Kindersley guidebooks has many full color photographs on each page to help kids to visualize sites they may want to visit. The book contains a two-page spread about the Millenium Dome, and mention of the London Eye, two new sites you won't find in older  travel books.  The information in this book is similar to that in the adult  version; it's just condensed so there is less text to wade through, and the  information focuses on aspects of each area that will be of interest to the  younger generation.  For instance, under Covent Garden, you'll read about  the street performers (who juggle swords and such) rather than the antique  market.  Basically, you can find this information elsewhere, but if you  want to give your kids a guide that they can read on their own on the  airplane, this is a nice book for the money.  In the back of the book are  some write-in quizes and journal pages for that interactive element.  It  even has a little pocket in the back for saving ticket stubs and other  souvenirs.	2000-06-14

Your kids  will wind up knowing more about Rembrandt than most adults ever will!  The  combination of cartoons with color photographs of the artist's paintings  makes the book lively to look at.  The text is interesting and easy to  read.  The artist's greatest works are shown within the context they were  made: what was going on in the artist's life, how the work was received by  society at the time.  I recommend this whole series of &quot;Getting to  Know Great Artists&quot; very highly.	2000-06-06

The Hiding Place is the true story of ordinary people who became heroes and heroines simply by maintaining the courage of their convictions.  They did not let fear of the Nazis prevent them from doing what they knew to be  the right thing - helping other human beings.  <br />This book also paints a  lifelike picture of Haarlem, Holland, before, during, and after the  invasion by Germany during World War II.  I enjoyed reading about this  wonderful family as they lived before the invasion.  &quot;The Hiding  Place&quot; is very well written, with vivid characters that come alive for  the reader.  <br />I wish this book was required reading in schools, to show  young people that true heroism is about more than shooting baskets or  becoming a movie star.  I hope the courage of the ten Boom family will  remind us all in the future that we are not helpless to resist evil.	2000-06-04

Demi retells Hans Christian Anderson's tale of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" with Chinese-style illustrations. Always a pleasure, her artwork in this book- bold compositions with bright colors and lots of \\"gold leaf\\"- is similar to that in many of her other books, such as \\"Kites: Magic Wishes That Fly in the Sky.\\" Her use of Chinese symbols and imagery here is not as relevant here as it is in her \\"Kites\\" book; it merely provides a new twist to an old tale. The book has several fold-out spreads, which kids enjoy, but these are not integral to the story as they are in her magnificent book, \\"One Grain of Rice: A Mathmatical Folktale.\\" The ending of Demi's version of this fairy tale is not quite satisfactory: we do not see the emperor embarrassed by his situation. Instead he obstinatly marches on, seeming without shame or remorse. In short, \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" is not Demi's best or most original work, but it is an attractive new version of a favorite story.	2000-06-02

Wells writes about speed in a book that is fun and easy for younger elementary school kids to understand.  The book compares the fastest living things such as the ostrich and cheetah, then moves on to  rocket ships and meteoroids and the speed of sound and light.  A chart in  the back compares how long it would take each of these to reach the moon  from earth!  I also recommend Wells' other books: &quot;Is a Blue Whale the  Biggest Thing There Is?&quot;  and &quot;What's Smaller than a Pygmy  Shrew?&quot;  I wish more kids' books were as fun and educational as these.	2000-06-01

This is a great book for preschoolers about making friends.  I thought the scenario was very similar to what many preschool children encounter when they enter a group of strange children and try to make friends.  Jim  wonders who will be his friend in his new school (which could also be a  daycare); some early encounters with other children are disappointing, but  eventually he forms a bond with another boy. This book can help three to  five year olds anticipate social situations at school or child care.	2000-05-27

When Jim's first grade class goes on a field trip to the Natural History Museum, Jim and some friends get seperated from the group.  Jim struggles with courage as he is frightened by a dinosaur skeleton, but regains his  bravery to find their teacher.  I like the illustrations of the museum,  especially the one in which Jim is alone in a room with a giant blue whale  hanging above... he looks down to its tail and finds his group.  It's nice  to read about Jim again.  We enjoyed him in the book &quot;Will I Have a  Friend?&quot; when Jim is in preschool.	2000-05-27

This little paperbck contains many true tales about Lincoln's life, from his birth in a log cabin, his hard work on the farm, the first book he owned, up to his presidency and  assasination.  The 22 stories are very short and written in simple  language.  The text is easy for even young children understand, but some of  the topics are heavy, including the death of Lincoln's mother while he was  still a child.  This book brings to life the humanity of Lincoln as a boy  and a man.  It is illustrated by black and white woodcut prints, with red  ink for the text.	2000-05-26

A girl is mad when a promised picnic is canceled due to rain.  Her father helps her think of ways to manage her anger and feel better.  The reader gets to pick a page to turn to depending on which idea she will try:  pounding clay, taking a bath, singing an un-mad song, etc.  We see her try  many ideas and eventually begin to feel better.  This is a great book to  teach kids that we are in control of how we manage our emotions.  We can  even be creative about it!	2000-05-19

As usual, Demi combines beautiful artwork with a traditional moral tale.  The illustrations are a fantastic combination of bold color and gold backgrounds, contrasted with delicate details and pen lines.  The story is  of a stone cutter who wishes to be someone else, first a rich man, then a  governer, eventually the sun, the wind, and so on.  An angel grants each  wish, but each time he changes his mind again.  Finally he winds up back as  a stonecutter, but much happier now that he realises his good fortune.  A  great book for those appreciate the unique.	2000-05-19

Matt is furious when his little brother ruins his best baseball card.  The reader gets to pick which of several ideas he should try to deal with his feelings: he could sock his brother, or he could kick a ball, or call a  friend to talk.  Flip to the page indicated to find out what happens if he  uses this technique, then try other ideas.  All paths eventually lead to  the same final resolution: a talk between the brothers and a truce.  This  book is an excellent way for children to see that their emotions are valid,  but that they can be in control of the results of those emotions.	2000-05-19

The simple words, and rhyme and rythm of the text make this a good choice for kids who are learning to read on their own.  They will also appreciate the school dilemma.  First we see what each child has brought for lunch.   Then Sam discovers that his lunch box is empty - his mother forgot to pack  his lunch. All Sam's friends pitch in to provide him with samples from  their lunches, and Sam winds up with a feast.  It's a nice story about  sharing and solving problems.	2000-05-18

This book is a great way to teach kids when it is appropriate to say &quot;no&quot; and when it is not.  For instance, if your friend wants to trade dolls with you, and don't want to trade, it is okay to say  &quot;no.&quot;  When someone tries to convince you to do something you  know is wrong, is it okay to say &quot;no.&quot; But it is not right to say  &quot;no&quot; if it is a lie (e.g. &quot;did you break this vase?&quot;)  or when your mother asks you to do something that will prevent you from  getting hurt or damaging property.  It also teaches about saying  &quot;no&quot; politely when you don't want to do something, such as play  with a friend.  We often think of &quot;no&quot; as a negetive word, but  this book reminds us all - adults and kids alike - that sometimes saying  &quot;no&quot; is the wise thing to do.	2000-05-18

This books teaches about the many reasons why kids sometimes feel sad, such as leaving some place where they are having fun, or mourning a pet's death.  Then it shows some ways to feel better, such talking with others or  getting involved in another activity.  The book emphasizes that it is okay  to be sad, but there are ways of feeling better when we are ready.	2000-05-18

A boy encounters a frusterating event (learning to roller skate and falling) and deals with his emotions.  What makes this series of books different from other books about feelings is the interactive approach.   Most pages end with a series of suggestions - ways to deal with emotion,  such as taking deep breaths, talking to someone about the feeling, or  taking a break.  The reader chooses one of the possible solutions, turns to  the page number indicated to see the result, then is offered more choices.   My son loved this book and it gave him a lot of ideas for handling tough  feelings.	2000-05-18

This is good book for emerging readers.  A lot of the simple words are repeated, making it easier for kids who are learning to read.  Rhyming text also helps early readers.  Most of the pages have just one or two  sentences, but the last few pages suddenly have more text.  It can be a bit  discouraging for kids who were doing great reading on their own to suddenly  have more trouble on the last few pages, when they are so close to the end!   Kids enjoy reading about common school dilemmas- in this case, all the  kids are out on the playground when a boy has to use the restroom- but he  isn't sure which is the boy's room.  There is nice mix of races in the  illustrations and one child in a wheel chair.	2000-05-18

This book is beautifully illustrated, and it explains the facts of life and death in a very direct and unsentimental way: all creatures have a lifetime, then they die. The book discusses the lifetimes of different  living creatures, from insects who only live a few days, to large mammals  who live many years.  It describes people as living for &quot;sixty or  seventy years, sometimes even more.&quot;  That is a little scary for a  child whose grandparents are already way past those ages and still in great  health.  &quot;Lifetimes&quot; explains the concepts of lifespan and death,  but does not offer comfort for those who fear death or are grieving.  I  recommend the book &quot;Gentle Willow&quot; for those who want a gentler,  more comforting story, that is no less true to fact.	2000-05-16

The Kids' Book about Death and Dying covers a wide range of subtopics including: learning to talk about death, death of a pet, death of children, and &quot;is there life after death?&quot; (This last question is dicussed  in an open-minded manner, describing many different beliefs.)  Even tough  subjects like euthanasia are defined and discussed, with a look at  differing opinions on the issue.  Due to the conversational style of the  book, filled with words and opinions of other children, kids who read this  book will feel less alone.	2000-05-16

A lot of childrens' books about death are either specific to one religion, or not spiritual at all.  This book is a nice bridge between the two extremes.  It alludes to the metamorphosis of caterpillar into butterfly,  and it describes death as change of form rather than an ending.  It also  talks about how the living can comfort the dying and how the we cherish  memories of them after death.  All of this is brought up very tenderly, in  the context of a squirrel whose friend, a tree, is dying.  The book even  touches on the emotions of anger and fear, without dwelling too much on  negatives.	2000-05-16

Let's Go London gets right to the point- all the basic information you need about food, lodging, and -most importantly- attractions without extra bells and whistles.  There is a color underground map in the front, along  with several color area maps.  There are no scenic photographs, but there  are a few advertisements in the book- I guess that keeps the price down.   Lots of good tips for those who want to travel and see the sights without  blowing a wad of money everywhere you go.	2000-04-26

In this lively tale, a poor boy in China who longs to paint is given a magic paintbrush by a mysterious visitor.  Suddenly the boy has the power to bring life to things that he paints.  Liang uses this gift for good,  until he must use his skill to outsmart an evil emperor who wants to use  the magic brush for his own greedy purposes.  The ending is a bit  troublesome- not as completely fair and peaceful as we might like - but  then, the tale is based on an old Chinese legend which, like Grimms' fairy  tales, were probably a lot more scary than story books today.  Still, the  story is wonderful and exciting and the illustrations, though subtle, are  lovely --delicate but colorful ink and watercolor drawings with lots of  detail.	2000-04-21

This first dictionary has an attractive and easy-to-read format, loaded with full color photographs and drawings.  Each word is in large bold type, followed by its definition and sometimes an example of its usage.   Illustrations help early readers locate the word they are looking for.  The  book also includes some large full page charts, such as the human body with  outer parts labeled (limbs and facial features- not internal organs) and a  page of dinosaurs.  But one will not find many specific types of dinosaurs  or whales here, just the basics.  Eventually older kids will need to move  on to a dictionary with more specific words.	2000-04-21

There are seperate  maps for attractions, hotels and restaurants in each city.  Hotels and  restaurants are listed by price range, and family-friendly establishments  are noted.  There is not a lot of historical background given in this book,  and no photographs.  The writing style is clear and direct and not too dry.   I found the recommended hotels in Amsterdam to be booked up months in  advance- obviously many are following Frommer's advice!	2000-04-19

This is not a &quot;best of mothers and sons stories&quot; anthology.  It is a somewhat haphazard collection of stories written by mothers and sons for this compilation.  Nowhere is it noted which stories are fiction and which are fact.  The reader can get through a whole story which reads like  a memoir, only to find out at the very end that it was fiction.  Very  confusing.  The introduction by Jill Morgan is just another sentimental ode  to the writer's own sons, giving little clue as to what is contained in the  book.  <br />There are a few gems amid the gravel however, including one  diamond: Eric Jerome Dickey's &quot;Fish Sammich with Cheese,&quot; a true  tale about the author as a five-year-old.  Taken from his loving foster  family by his disturbed biological mother on the pretense of getting a fish  &quot;sammich&quot;, it is a poignant and brilliantly written story of a  brave child's struggle to find his way back home.<br />The photographs which  accompany each story are a nice touch, putting a personal face on the  stories.  But again, they add to the confusion as to which stories are  memoir and which are fiction: are the mother and son pictured the ones that  the story is about, or not?  <br />Some of the stories end with an  &quot;afterward&quot; from the author and some do not.  There are  biographical notes on the authors at the back of the book.  Overall, there  are some good tales in here, but better organization of the material would  have made for a much more enjoyable read.	2000-04-18

From &quot;abacus&quot; to &quot;zillion,&quot; detailed descriptions are combined with fun cartoons and illustrations that bring  math concepts down to earth.

How many grown-ups really  know the quantity of a google, the two ways of writing a google, and how  this number got the name &quot;google&quot; in the first place?<br />Armed  with this book, I was finally able to answer some of my son's questions,  such as &quot;what comes after a trillion?&quot;  Answer: a quadrillion, a  quintillion, a sextillion, and so forth.  This information is filed under  &quot;z is for zillion,&quot; where it is explained that a zillion is not a  real number, but merely means &quot;a lot.&quot;  (One of many math myths  dispelled in the book.)  Some other terms that are explained include:  &quot;fibonacci,&quot; &quot;exponent,&quot; and &quot;probability,&quot;  as well as the less intimidating &quot;jupiter&quot; and  &quot;diamond.&quot;  <br />While the alphabet format is more conducive to  browsing than reference, there is a glossary of math terms in the back of  the book.  &quot;G is for Google&quot; is primarily for ages nine and up,  although some younger children who are particularly interested or gifted in  math may benefit.	2000-04-16

According to this book, every day in this world 364,321 people are born and 147,137 people die.  That means that every day there are 217,184 more people on this planet!  Each person I know who has looked through this book  finds at least one amazing fact that sticks with them long after the book  is closed.  The facts and figures are illustrated by fascinating pictures,  charts and diagrams; for instance, some of the world's most famous  buildings and sites are drawn to scale with one another, so you can see how  the pyramid of Giza stacks up against the Eiffel Tower... and you'll also  find out how many visitors each one  attracts each day.  You'll find out  that the average American watches 7 hours of television per day - but the  average in Japan is 9 hours!  (Denmark - only 1 hour and 54 minutes.) There  is a center spread page about animals: how many miles does a grizzly bear  travel per day, how much does a mole eat in a day?  From science to nature,  to human consumption, it's all here and yes, there is an index.  This book  is oversize, which makes it pleasant to look at, but unpleasant to fit into  a standard bookshelf.  &quot;The World in One Day&quot; is a treat for  information junkies of all ages.	2000-04-01

I bought this book for a six-year-old and thought it was too baby-ish for him.  I would recommend it for the preschool crowd, not ages over 5.  While it was nice to hear a more peaceful version of the &quot;old woman who  lived in a shoe&quot; poem, the rhymes were somewhat predictable and there  was no surprise in the story.  The repetition may be soothing for young  children but could be dull for older kids.  The illustrations are bright  and cheerful, but very cutesy... why do animals in childrens' books so  often get dressed up like little people?  I would have liked to see  illustrations of rabbits without people-clothes better.	2000-04-01

These ten stories focus more on travel in the imagination than travel through space.  &quot;Travel Tales&quot; is a gold mine of illustration art: from the cartoonish to the painterly, with some collage and airbrush  technique thrown in for good measure.  The pages are without borders, so  artwork saturates each page.  Even the text design is unique in each story.   <br />Ten European artists contributed to this diverse collection.  The  strangest story, &quot;A Snail's Pace,&quot; is about a girl whose nose  takes a trip during a boring dinner party. More conventional stories  include &quot;Alfred of a Thousand Journeys,&quot; about a boy exploring  his grandmother's house, where the kitchen is &quot;the land of  sweets&quot; and the basement contains &quot;mysterious underground  regions.&quot;  My favorite is &quot;Aziz, the Blue Carpet,&quot; in which  a flying carpet slips under the door, escaping for a wild ride to the  desert.<br />Some reviewers have written that these stories are too off-beat  to be appreciated by younger children, but I disagree.  The youngest among  us are most open-minded, and don't necessarily expect pat endings.  My son  enjoyed this book very much at age five.  Older folks may be more likely to  consider these stories &quot;wierd&quot; because most do not follow the  usual formulaic plots or moralistic endings so common in children's  literature.  I give this book five stars for those who appreciate the  unconventional in art and literature; four stars for those who may prefer a  more traditional story book.	2000-04-01

While planning a driving tour of mainland Europe, I came accross Baedeker's Switzerland.  The book whetted my appetite for Switzerland with its many small but gorgeous full color photographs of sites throughout  Switzerland.  One can enjoy this book even without visiting the country.   However, we did take this book along on our journey and found it to be an  essential guide, chock full of detailed  information.  The full size  foldout road map tucked into the back cover flap is ideal for a driving  trip.  The book also includes many smaller maps of towns and cities, and  even maps of major museums and cathedrals.  Also included is information on  the history and geography of Switzerland, a list of hotels and restaurants,  and basic travel information.  Most of the book is organized alphabetically  by town with information and photographs of each area; this is handy for  looking up towns as you are passing through or deciding where to stop.   Main attractions are rated with one or two stars, and we found these  estimations to be accurate. I also like the format of the guide; it is not  too large, a good size to travel with, with a plastic sleeve to protect the  book and map.  This book had everything we needed for the Switzerland leg  of our trip, and I would even go so far as to say &quot;it's the only guide  you'll need.&quot;  The photographs inside are so lovely that I keep it to  remember beautiful Switzerland by.  My only complaint is that this book is  no longer in print!	2000-03-31

Fantastic illustrations for this classic fable about a man who catches a magic fish.  The man releases the fish when it speaks to him and asks him to spare its life.  In gratitude, the fish grants him a wish, but the man's greedy wife demands more and more....  Children love this magical tale, and adults will appreciate the detailed decorations in this rendition.	2000-02-20

Of several books we lugged to Europe recently, this one (actually a 1997 version bought off a sale table) was by far the most useful!  At first I was disappointed by the lack of photos and snappy graphics, but once I  started reading it aloud in our rental car, we were all laughing out loud  and were hooked.  We used several of his recommendations for laundromats  and hotels, where we bumped into other Rick Steves devotees following the  same advice.  Some of the hotels he recommends may be full due to his good  word, but ask there for similar accomodations and they may point you to an  equally agreeable place - we did this in Interlaken and found a the  wonderful Hotel de la Paix.  Now we are planning another trip to Europe and  are stocking up on Rick Steves' latest books to take along.	1999-11-28

The pictures in which the animals help Nell build the snowman are delightful.  However, I didn't find the story's message very clear or meaningful.  A child shouldn't have  to prove herself to her own family, as does the child in this story.	1999-11-28
US	52243760	R38BESXGHNRHW7	0684814994	379325454	The Christmas Box	Books	2	11	19	N	N	A nice story, but doesn't merit a whole book.	This is a nice short story, but it doesn't stand alone as a book.  I found the story predictable and sentimental, but still enjoyable enough to read.  It's worth spending the hour or so it takes to read it, but I'm glad I just  borrowed it from the library.	1999-11-06

Gift-giving is a good thing, but our gifts can be less about monetary value and more about reaching out to one another.  The idea is to give more of our time and care and less of extra stuff that most of us don't need.  I  gave the book four stars instead of five because it is too short!  I would  have liked to read more about alternative ideas for celebrating and making  gifts.  The description of how Christmas has evolved, while pertinent, was  my least favorite part of the book.  I truly enjoyed reading about how the  author's family and friends celebrate Christmas with a minimum of  materialism.  This is a great book to start of the holidays by remembering  what really matters.	1999-11-06
