The narrator and Luo are teenagers sent to the country in order to be re-educated.  In the late 60s in China, it was decided that education was dangerous and that the youth should spend some time doing hard labor in the country in order to adopt good proletarian values.  Luo and the narrator were especially in trouble because they came from educated families (doctors and dentists).  The work is hard, but much more is the isolation, the boredom and the lack of hope.  Books are forbidden objects, and like anything illegal, they become the object of obsession for the narrator and Luo, and they do not stop till they are able to find some.<br /><br />Simultaneously, they befriend the daughter of the local tailor, a girl beautiful and pure.  Both boys fall for her.  She chooses Luo.  Luo sets on a quest to educate the little seamstress of the title, and begins to read to her the great works of Honor&eacute; de Balzac.<br /><br />I am surprised at the many readers that were confused by the ending.  To me it is very obvious what happened.  In very prosaic terms, Luo \\"created a monster\\".  The little seamstress was a country bumpkin, who didn't know a thing about the world.  She lived in the mountains, believed in sorcerers, and was completely unaware of herself as a woman.  After opening her eyes to other worlds, which is what happens when you read books, she awakened, took charge of her own worth, and grew up.<br /><br />I enjoyed the ending, the simplicity of it, and the heartbreak the reader suffers.  I like to be surprised by what i read, so i appreciated it.  But in general i was left with the sense that this book has been overrated.  It was an OK read, but it was nothing special.	2005-10-09

One of the best short stories i have ever read is by Lee Smith (Live Bottomless, in News of the Spirit).  So i was really looking forward to this book.  I have to admit that short stories are not for everyone.  Sometimes, especially if they are too good, you may feel let down when they finish.  But the stories in this collection are great.  Each one of them, though, would make great preludes to a novel.<br /><br />Lee Smith writes about Southern characters without the common fallback of making them seem lovable hicks.  There's many an author (and especially movie writers) who love to portray Southerners as a bunch of illiterate adorable rednecks.  This is not the case with her.  The stories could be set anywhere, except that there is always an air, a scent of all things Southern, percolating the narratives.<br /><br />Some of the common themes throughout the stories are the ability to see the future, the stigma of being a \\"fast\\" woman, and the curse of being artistic.<br /><br />I'd recommend this collection to anyone!	2005-09-25

Then you decide to write down those memories, and your humorous tone is so sharp that your narrative ends up being quite serious.<br /><br />Well, that's A Girl Named Zippy.  At first it was easy to just be taken by the comical and self-deprecating observations of Haven Kimmel, but there is more down there.  The humor is just skin-deep.<br /><br />This book reminds me of a comment i heard once about the paintings of Joan Mir&oacute; ([...]  Someone said \\"A five-year-old can paint like that\\".  And maybe so, but the amazing thing is that Mir&oacute; wasn't five when he did them.  Haven Kimmel writes in an effortless, simplistic manner that is FAR from being simple.  I found that amazing.	2005-09-10

The detached, almost clinical tone in which the story is narrated, the sharp eye used in evaluating the complexities of a man-woman relationship, the discussion of depression, the happy, soft ending...  Steve Martin is a very talented actor, but he is a much, much better writer.  Do you know he is also a banjo virtuoso?<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, a perfect example of a novel where you have endearing characters that you will love despite their shortcomings.  Nothing is hidden, but the naked reality and truthfulness of Mirabelle, Ray, Jeremy, and yes, even the beecharoony Lisa, made them unforgettable to me.  I've said it before and i'll say it again: there is nothing more endlessly fascinating than human nature, and this is what I look for in a book.  This one gets a TEN!	2005-08-26

After all, many have raved about it, and it would be very uncouth of me to slam it.  So I'm a little sweaty under the collar, because I did not love it.<br /><br />I have to admit it grew on me.  Right off the start, though, I found the characters of Quoyle and Petal completely unbelievable, and some of the situations utterly incredible (for example, the children being peddled to a molester).  And the ending!  I will not spoil it here, but after you read it, go ahead and tell me this was not the most absurd ending of the century!<br /><br />The ungrammatical and incomplete sentences threw me for a loop (no pun intended), and I had a hard time getting used to them.  On the other hand, I liked the way Quoyle reflected on things under his journalistic prism: \\"Man Imitates Alligator\\", \\"Man Escapes Endless Song\\"...<br /><br />I enjoyed the overall tone of the novel, each chapter a brief review of time and place.  But this is not a novel brimming with action, which I imagine will disappoint a lot of people.  Another thing that did not bother me too much but that I know annoys many is the loose ends (no pun intended again).  You may be left with a lot of unresolved questions: how come Quoyle grew up to be so meek and caring, after growing up in holy hell?  What happened to Bill Pretty?  How was Quoyle's mother?<br /><br />Annie Proulx did a great job describing the harsh life in a God's forsaken place like Newfoundland, a region I knew nothing abut before reading this book.  I have read only one other book by her, Postcards, which I love.<br /><br />Next, I plan to watch the movie, although I have a hard time seeing handsome Kevin Spacey as \\"lardass\\" Quoyle.	2005-08-26

The story is like White Oleander, only worse, because this one happened for real.<br /><br />Boy, if you thought you had a rough childhood, you should read this.  Or if your kids whine and complain about how bad you are, hand them this book.  The parallels between Snow White and Jennifer's story are plentiful.<br /><br />The writing is super-slooooooow, and somewhat exasperating: \\"I took the cereal out of the cupboard.  I grabbed a bowl.  I put some cereal in it.  I went to the fridge and got some milk.  I poured the milk into the bowl\\"...  You get the idea.<br /><br />I knew nothing about this true story before I started reading it, so I don't want to give too much away.  I like being surprised.  For example, I found out there is a sequel to this story, Still Waters, and I read somewhere a little of what happens in it, and I am bummed out that I found out some details.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that it is not fair for a human being to have such rotten bad luck, in so many levels.  This could be a good anthem book for the disintegration of the American family.  When the mother dies, the dad decides to stay in LA, instead of going back to Nevada, where he could have had the support of his extended family.  After you read the book, you realize that selfishness makes adults see kids as irrelevant as furniture.  Where were Jennifer's grandparents, aunts, uncles, when her life started to unravel?<br /><br />I did a web search after reading Blackbird, wanting to learn more about Deb.  I then learned about the heated debate that exists between one side and the other.  Who to trust?  I was, again, a little deflated by the controversy.	2005-08-22

Call me a masochist...  Many times i am left with disappointment, and unfortunately this was no exception.  I do have a problem when Spanish and English are liberally mixed in narration.  People DON'T talk that way.  If you are a native Spanish speaker and you are telling a story in English, you may need help with a word here and there, depending on your proficiency.  But the language patchwork shown in this book is nowhere near reality.  Some of the expressions were so contrived they stank: \\"When I had nine years\\" is a literal translation from the Spanish, very different from the \\"When I was nine years old\\".  A person that has lived in the US, married to an American college professor for years, should know better.  This was just a little quirk of the author, a little \\"cuteness\\" that may sound lovely to some of her audience, but to me sounded totally forced and contrived.<br /><br />I am not Mexican, but I have to wonder if Mexican women get a little tired of yet another survival story that involves extreme poverty, sex, abuse, alcohol, violence...  I have read so many of these that I suffer from overexposure, and that's when the topic starts losing relevance.	2005-08-15

I didn't know anything about the story, or the author.  I got this book simply because I liked the title.  I had to endure that god-awful song during my junior high-school years, so I was really hoping for a nice surprise.  Book, please don't let me down.<br /><br />I loved it!  I went through the 635 pages of it in amazement, enjoying everything.  This is a complex story that covers a lot of ground.  Gloria is a college student in the 50's.  Her parents are well to do; she lives in a lot of comfort, but is surprisingly brainy and resourceful.  She has a difficult mother, a functional alcoholic, who is not ageing gracefully.  She is extremely jealous of Gloria, and shows that at any opportunity.<br /><br />The book pretty much starts even before Gloria is born.  Her mom is rich, her dad is not.  He works very hard to become worthy to the eyes of her family, and slowly starts climbing the corporate ladder.  Gloria is sent to boarding school from an early age, and she develops the resourcefulness that later on will save her integrity, if not her life.<br /><br />During long, boring summers at home, she reads and reads and writes papers that are doctoral theses' material.  She goes to college to study English Literature.  She falls in love, disgracefully, and has a fabulous English teacher, who will be key in her emotional development.  Everybody should have a person like that in their lives, someone who is not blinded by love, but that appreciates you enough to know what's the best route for you.  I love books where there is such a figure present, maybe out of a yearning for such a person in my life (not now, but 20 years ago, when such advice could have saved me a lot of heartache).<br /><br />Gloria joins a sorority (in fact, this was the most tedious part of the book), and develops wonderful friendships.  She defies conventions in an aggressive way, and keeps on truckin' with the certainty of rightfulness.<br /><br />One amazing part of the book is the research notes at the end.  The author explains what his sources of information were, and I enjoyed seeing the background work required by this novel.<br /><br />I loved this book so much, and found it so varied, engaging, and hopeful that I recommend it to everybody.  It is long, but if you're not afraid of volume and want to be captivated by a young woman on the path of self-righteousness in the middle of a constraining society, this is the book for you!tainty of rightfulness. <br /> <br />One amazing part of the book is the research notes at the end.

I also happened to read one of the novels written by her daughter, Linda Gray Sexton, \\"Points of Light\\", which I did not like all that much.  So I had (I thought) an idea of who Linda was, both through the biography and her novel.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Searching for Mercy Street is truly what the subtitle claims: \\"A journey back to my mother\\".  It gets so personal it is embarrassing at times.  Linda goes into a lot of detail as to why she revealed things that you would never want anybody outside of your family to know, and it makes sense, and yet it doesn't.  I have never read a better account of life with another person.  It is not 100% chronological, but it is rich in detail and clarity.  I read it with the anticipation I have sometimes when reading a very interesting novel.<br /><br />Long time ago a friend said: \\"Your parents are probably the only people that you may love even if you don't like them\\".  I have thought about that comment quite a bit over the years.  Linda was conflicted over the relationship she had with her mother.  There was the void of not having had a mom in the general sense of the term, not so much a June Cleaver, but more someone who takes care of you, looks after you, helps you, loves you.  There was the abuse.  And mingled with everything else, there was the unconditional love.  The complexities of mental illness are true and clear and never better represented than in this story.  I have to wonder: how much of Anne's behavior was pure selfishness, and how much was her disease?<br /><br />I had to cry at some of the stuff, because you know the pain was real and strong, and there was no prettifying any of the horrible things that went on at that household.  And at the same time I had to smile at certain things, like the tenderness in the relationship between Linda and her father.  It was heartwarming, among all the raw pain.<br /><br />The choice of photos complemented the writing perfectly.  I loved reading this memoir, pain and sordid details and all.e raw pain.<br /><br />The choice of photos complemented the writing perfectly.

Muscle: Confessions of an Unlikely Bodybuilder explains perfectly what this book is about.  Sam Fussell's parents are scholars, literary critics.  He grew up in Princeton, and went to college in Oxford.  Nothing in his past could have hinted to his future.  His transformation started in NYC.  Sam was intimidated by the street characters, the thugs and the mentally unstable, and even though he was tall (6'4\\"), he was also a string bean.  The book has photos to prove it.  So he joined the YMCA, started to lift weights, and bodybuilding became his obsession.  He made a 180° turn and abandoned \\"civilization\\" (more or less, that's what his family and friends thought), and focused completely on bodybuilding, much to the chagrin of his parents.<br /><br />The book is great in that it gives a sneak peek into the lifestyle of bodybuilding.  I had no idea of what was involved.  I knew it had to do with a lot of pumping iron and steroids, but that's nothing.  Sam goes into great details as to his daily life, his diet, his training, his \\"supplements\\".  Equally fascinating is the entire culture, more like a \\"cult\\", that surrounds bodybuilding, and his descriptions of Vinnie, Nimrod, Sweetpea, and all his other buddies on both coasts.<br /><br />Parallel to the account of his life as a bodybuilder, Sam goes deep into his reasons for pursuing such a career.  I can't remember a more honest memoir.  He certainly gets to the bottom of his fears, his insecurities, and describes his muscles as a sort of armor that would protect him not from muggers, but from life itself.  He was afraid of living.  Not to go into too much psychoanalysis, but I can see how some of Sam's insecurities may have been coming from an emotionally unavailable father.  When Sam finally quits bodybuilding and tells his father that he's going to write a memoir, Paul Fussell replies: \\"All is forgiven, literature is bigger than people\\".  What a thing to say.  What is to forgive?  The fact that he didn't become a lawyer, like you had expected?<br /><br />The book has some wonderful photos of Sam, before and after his transformation. The photos are very necessary to understand some of the competition poses.  They are also easy on the eyes.  What a hunkalicious bod.  And what a dreamy face!  Quite a complete package, smart, articulate, sensitive, handsome and ripped.give?

I just love the literary images he comes up with.  Nebraska is a collection of short stories, all very different from each other.  My favorites:<br /><br />\\"Wickedness\\": winters in Nebraska can be brutal, but January of 1888 will go down in history.  The weather was pure wickedness. The story is a collage of small stories.  It opens on a train, where a young teacher, on her way to Nebraska, shares the ride with a poor carpenter who lost his limbs and ears to frostbite.  It continues with a variety of sad and happy endings.  My favorite was the one about the pony in charge of delivering a message to parents who did not know where their child was.<br /><br />\\"True Romance\\": another great story, very allegorical, about a mysterious evil force that kills cows in a particularly gruesome way.  Don't want to spoil the ending, but I certainly did not see it coming.<br /><br />\\"Red-Letter Days\\": an old man, avid golfer, recovering alcoholic, retired lawyer, keeps a diary.  If you thought that diaries were only for teenage girls, think again.  So sweet, so moving the feelings that he can pour on those pages.	2005-07-12

This is a slow a narrative as it gets, and rightfully so.  It is a very beautiful book.  The Mrs. Stevens of the title is a poet.  A newly published book of poems is bringing her fame and attention.  A couple of journalists want to interview her.  The book has four parts:<br /><br />° her preparations and musings pre-interview:  Hilary Stevens was born in New England with a hot-blooded Mediterranean personality.  She was never the daughter her parents expected, and she hated being a girl, because at an early age she understood all the extra constraints she would have to endure just for that fact.  She recounts her discoveries of love, her early passions, her writing, with a mixture of loving nostalgia and disgust.<br /><br />° the interviewers dialogs on their way to her house: esoteric English majors (boy and girl) waxing about the beauty of language and love (quite boring, in my opinion)<br /><br />° the interview itself: where Hilary takes the interviewers for a wrestling match of the brains, the meaning of life, the meaning of her poems, and comes out very victorious.  Hilary and the girl journalist understand each other and make the boy journalist feel inadequate.<br /><br />° the post-interview and the following day: Hilary has a young friend, Mar, who helps her in the garden and does small repairs in her cottage.  Mar is tormented, coming to terms with his homosexuality.  Hilary can understand this very well, because she was/is a passionate person, and Mar is still searching for the tools to deal with his passion in a less destructive way.  Hilary suggests poetry as a good avenue.  Mar and Hilary have fruitful conversations by the ocean.  After a few days of stirring the past, Hilary comes to terms with her life as best as she can.	2005-07-04

I think I could have enjoyed this play so much more if I were.  This play is a heart-wrenching witnessing of the final months in the life of a woman suffering from ovarian cancer.  A rather quick read, both by flow and sheer amount of pages, Wit nonetheless says everything it has to say in unequivocal terms, and it is in that where I found some fault.  Dr. Jason is very one-dimensional: for him, patients are the mere vehicles where cancer resides, and cancer is the ultimate enemy.  He sees his research as a fight, a battle of the wits, between cancerous cells and intelligent brains such as his.  Villains (and heroes) are rarely so simplistic.  The beauty of evil is that it is so often (and paradoxically) intermingled with confusion and self-doubt, the same way goodness is.  In that sense, Vivian was better portrayed.  She was no saint, yet her epiphany is almost holy (as it should very well be).	2005-07-04

Sure, i read The Great Gatsby centuries ago, but in Spanish. I also watched the movie. But that's it. Dare i say, then, that if this had been finished, edited and released, it would not have the same success it has? Part of the aura of The Last Tycoon is that FSF, on account of his death, never finished it. I found the prose a bit difficult, and there were enough situations loaded with innuendo that i was not able to resolve. For example, the cameraman who attempted suicide. Was he going blind? Was all a malicious rumor? How about the actor who is \\"through\\"? What unspeakable issue does he suffer from to stop his career? \\"I've tried everything. I even - one day in desperation I went down to - to Claris. But it was hopeless. I'm washed up\\". Does he mean he was impotent?<br /><br />So i found the novel itself very frustrating. However, i found the development notes fascinating. Those notes offered a fantastic behind-the-scenes peek at how a novel is written. I had no idea there was such a method. My guess was that the process was far more visceral, more gut-feeling as to what should happen now and what then. But by reading the notes that FSF left, i understand what a systematic and structured process it is.	2005-06-20

Not enough contemporary stories, and I am, after all, a lover of contemporary literature.  I get discouraged when I read older novels.  The language seems too stiff at times.  So, I approached this collection with caution.  A good example of what I mean about older writing being slightly formal for my taste was the short story we've all had to read in English Lit classes: \\"The Yellow Wall-Paper\\", by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.  Another example is the opening story, \\"Life in the Iron-Mills\\" by Rebecca Harding Davis.  After a few pages I just hjad to skip them.<br /><br />That said, I luckily enjoyed most of the stories quite a bit.  I think the editor had very good care in choosing stories that had universal appeal.  My favorite is \\"Transcendental Wild Oats\\", by Louisa May Alcott.  I know more than a \\"nothing-but-organic\\" zealot who should read this one.  I found it amazing that Alcott, back in the late 1800s, was able to offer such accurate criticism of the ridiculous views that some take on behalf of misguided ideals and very few facts.<br /><br />Another story I enjoyed was \\"A White Heron\\" by Sarah Orne Jewett, where a young girl has to choose between her love of the bird on the title and receiving some very needed money in exchange for pointing out its nest to a hunter.  I think the whole debate in the girl's mind was very well developed.  I also liked Willa Cather's \\"Paul's Case\\", with Paul being an eccentric young man who gets used to the high life too soon.  And another favorite was \\"Sweat\\"  by Zora Neale Hurston, a story full of karma.	2005-06-17

I never met a Spanish adolescent with such an empathic head on his shoulders, and i've met a few.<br /><br />This fluffy novel is perfect when you're semi-comatose and can't handle heavy writing but still want to have a book to move your eyes through.<br /><br />It has a Spanish lexicon on the back. The spelling of Spanish words was quite good. No mistakes! My only objection is that in Spain you don't go into a caf&eacute; and ask for a capuccino. That's Italy. Other than that, no complaints for geographical or social veracity. My main objection remains Juan's maturity.	2005-06-15

After reading this, you will stop thinking that your parents did a crappy job.  This is one of those stories that if it were made into a movie would be criticized as being too exaggerated.  Barbara Robinette Moss was born the fourth in a family of nine children.  The book opens with Moss' mother eating beans and corn that were intended for planting.  This was the only thing to eat in the house, so she scrubbed off the fungicide covering each bean and kernel as best she could, ate them and made the children wait two hours to see if the food was safe.  This sets the tone for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Unlike Angela's Ashes, there is no humor seeping through the pages.  Unlike Bastard Out of Carolina (which is not a memoir per se, but autobiographical enough), the writing is quite choppy and there are many loose ends, especially towards the end.  But it has such brutality that of course it will appeal to your voyeuristic side.<br /><br />Much of the narration is centered about Moss' ugliness.  I wish she had included a photo of herself in those days.  There is the photo on the front cover (her sister Alice looks like John Kerry), where she looks quite normal.  I really wanted to see a before-and-after photo.  Then there is a very blurry photo of her father, and a photo of her mother.  This one is very telling.  The mother, Dorris, who in the book at times only wears one \\"r\\", was an educated woman.  She went to college and studied music, recorded some albums, loved to sing and to recite poetry.  She did not fit in the kind of life or the kind of marriage that she chose.  The father, S.K., came from an Irish family that arrived in the US at the time of the potato famine.  He was a mean drunk in a family of mean drunks, as you will read later in the book.

US	52987300	R17P7YAM1Y0VD1	8486478898	743713818	USA sub 21: Un joven por Estados Unidos (Andar y ver) (Spanish Edition)	Books	1	1	1	N	N	Un mentecato por Estados Unidos	Estaba yo curioseando en la librer&iacute;a de El Corte Ingl&eacute;s cuando me encontr&eacute; con una pila de libros en oferta.  A euro cada uno, y como era la Feria del Libro, encima ten&iacute;an un 10% de descuento.  Menos mal que no me gast&eacute; mucho en este bodrio.  Bajo la premisa de que sabe de lo que habla, Eduardo Verd&uacute; nos \\"transmite sus agudas impresiones\\" sobre Estados Unidos.<br /><br />El desprecio con que Verd&uacute; escribe sobre sus experiencias en los EE.UU. me recuerda un poco al shock cultural que sufr&iacute; durante mi primer a&ntilde;o de universidad ah&iacute;.  A&ntilde;oraba tanto a Espa&ntilde;a que no pod&iacute;a ver m&aacute;s all&aacute; de mis narices.  Si era americano, malo.  Si era espa&ntilde;ol, bueno.  No me gustaba nada, odiaba la comida, la ropa, la tele, el idioma...<br /><br />Pero pas&oacute; un a&ntilde;o.  Mi ingl&eacute;s mejor&oacute;.  Hice amigos.  Me met&iacute; m&aacute;s de lleno en mis estudios, muy interesantes.  Empec&eacute; a trabajar unas cuantas horas a la semana.  Ten&iacute;a m&aacute;s dinerito.  Y un d&iacute;a de oto&ntilde;o me fij&eacute; en los &aacute;rboles del campus, todos preciosos, con las hojas en miles de tonos rojos, naranjas y amarillos.  No recordaba haberme dado cuenta de ellos el a&ntilde;o anterior, probablemente porque ten&iacute;a la cabeza tan metida en la tierra que se me pas&oacute;.<br /><br />Y eso es lo que creo le ha pasado a este hombre.  Ha escrito este relato sin haber superado su shock cultural, lo cual es muy triste.<br /><br />Vine a estudiar y aqu&iacute; sigo.  Hay muchas cosas que a&ntilde;oro de Espa&ntilde;a, pero hay muchas otras que me parecen incre&iacute;blemente mejores aqu&iacute;.  Mi madre dice que la gente en los cinco continentes s&oacute;lo se diferencia en c&oacute;mo hacen el arroz, y tiene raz&oacute;n.  Los sentimientos son universales.<br /><br />Este libro me parece un triste desperdicio de papel por las siguientes razones:<br /><br />Un buen editor podr&iacute;a haber corregido las muchas faltas que se encuentran en &eacute;l:<br /><br />* acerca\\" en vez de \\"a cerca\\"<br /><br />*  \\"Michael\\" en vez de \\"Michel Jordan\\" o \\"Michel Bolton\\" (es que estaba pensando en el jugador del Real Madrid<br /><br />*  el hecho de que las palabras en ingl&eacute;s no llevan acentos, como \\"prec&aacute;lculus\\"<br /><br />*  \\"Viper\\", no \\"Vipper\\"<br /><br />*  \\"Marilyn\\", no \\"Marylin\\"<br /><br />*  \\"Memphis\\", no \\"Menphis\\"<br /><br />* mi favorita, \\"coche\\" en vez de \\"choche\\"<br /><br />*  \\"Kniks\\" en vez de \\"Knicks\\"<br /><br />*  \\"gansters\\" en vez de \\"gangsters\\"<br /><br />*  \\"hibismus\\" en vez de \\"hibiscus\\" (es lat&iacute;n , por cierto), o \\"hibisco\\"<br /><br />*  \\"reagge\\" en vez de \\"reggae\\"<br /><br />*  \\"holyday\\" en vez de \\"holiday\\"<br /><br />&iexcl;Ah!, y el \\"bosque sagrado\\" de Hollywood (!!!).  Hollywood quiere decir \\"bosque de acebos\\".  Bosque sagrado ser&iacute;a Holywood.<br /><br />Para el pr&oacute;ximo libro me avisas, que como ver&aacute;s tengo buen ojo para las meteduras de pata.<br /><br />Un editor americano podr&iacute;a haber corregido algunos detalles m&aacute;s, tales como el hecho de que la gran mayor&iacute;a de los estudiantes se quedan en su estado para asistir a la universidad.  Es una cuesti&oacute;n de impuestos.  Si no eres residente del estado, tu matr&iacute;cula es unas tres veces m&aacute;s alta.  Pocos estudiantes se pueden permitir eso (y no es porque como afirma Verd&uacute;, los americanos son muy taca&ntilde;os).  La residencia se puede obtener al cabo de haber vivido en ese estado durante un a&ntilde;o.  Tambi&eacute;n un editor americano podr&iacute;a haber aclarado el significado de Halloween, y que la expresi&oacute;n \\"Treat or Trick\\" viene a decir \\"O me das caramelos o te hago una trastada\\".  &iquest;\\"Treat\\" traducido como \\"trato\\"?  Me da un poco de verg&uuml;enza ajena el leer chapuzas como esta.<br /><br />Referente a la televisi&oacute;n, \\"o tienes [...] cable o no ves m&aacute;s que marmotas y violonchelistas\\".  Mentira podrida.  Las series americanas que tanto &eacute;xito tienen en el resto del mundo en su gran mayor&iacute;a  no son de cable.  Por ejemplo, CSI, ER, The Simpsons, Desperate Wives, Big Brother...  El experto Verd&uacute; nos informa tambi&eacute;n que cuando te apuntas al cable \\"pierdes los canales locales\\".  Otra mentira como una casa.  No s&oacute;lo no los pierdes, sino que encima puedes solicitar canales locales de la otra punta del pa&iacute;s si quieres.  Hubo un tiempo en el que pens&eacute; que la tele en Espa&ntilde;a era de categor&iacute;a superior a la americana.  Pero hace mucho tiempo de eso, antes de que aparecieran La Salsa Rosa, Cr&oacute;nicas Marcianas, los infomercials de los que tanto despotrica, y compa&ntilde;&iacute;a.  En mi &uacute;ltima visita a Espa&ntilde;a tuve la oportunidad de ver a Buenafuente, al que todo el mundo me alab&oacute;.  Este tipo hace un calco tan al pie de la letra de Jay Leno, David Letterman y Conan O'Brien, americanos todos ellos, que lo deber&iacute;an demandar por plagio descarado.  Verd&uacute;, lo americano vende, lo americano se imita, desde los programas de televisi&oacute;n hasta las tarjetas de descuento de los supermercados, y me parece un poco infantil que critiques tan de punta a rabo a un pa&iacute;s al que Espa&ntilde;a se est&aacute; pareciendo cada vez m&aacute;s.<br /><br />El amigo Koji, &iquest;en qu&eacute; quedamos, era japon&eacute;s o tailand&eacute;s?  &iquest;Y a qu&eacute; viene ese comentario de que los tailandeses no te dan ni la hora?  Por lo menos esto refleja que Verd&uacute; desprecia a m&aacute;s nacionalidades que a la americana.  Su pacater&iacute;a va m&aacute;s all&aacute; del reino animal, ya que desprecia a las orqu&iacute;deas como especie \\"obscenamente artificiosa\\".  Vamos, que donde se ponga un castizo geranio que se quite todo lo dem&aacute;s.  Verd&uacute; se revela como un hip&oacute;crita cuando critica a Las Vegas por ser una ciudad en la que \\"nadie quiere m&aacute;s que tu dinero\\".  Asombroso.  En Madrid es todo lo contrario.  En Espa&ntilde;a todos los hermanos se quieren, y es por eso que no se usan motes despectivos ni los mayores les dicen a los peque&ntilde;os que son adoptados.  Eso s&oacute;lo pasa en este cochino pa&iacute;s, donde todos son descendientes directos de Ca&iacute;n.<br /><br />Eso de que los americanos no tienen inter&eacute;s en conocer a extranjeros es un comentario digno de un d&eacute;bil mental.  Hay de todo, por supuesto, pero una generalizaci&oacute;n tan amplia est&aacute;, desde luego, totalmente fuera de lugar.  Cada vez que voy a Espa&ntilde;a, Francia, Reino Unido, me encuentro con m&aacute;s americanos por la calle.  Si tanta indiferencia le tienen a los extranjeros, &iquest;qu&eacute; hacen gast&aacute;ndose los euros o las libras a mansalva, cuando podr&iacute;an estar en casita bebiendo cocacola y jugando al b&eacute;isbol?  Y bueno, sin necesidad de salir del pa&iacute;s, la variedad culinaria es enorme.  No s&oacute;lo de hamburguesas vive el americano, sino que hay restaurantes de todos tipos virtualmente en cada esquina.  En cualquier supermercado puedo encontrar aut&eacute;nticas aceitunas espa&ntilde;olas, y para m&aacute;s inri sevillanas (y si no se encuentran m&aacute;s productos espa&ntilde;oles no es culpa nada m&aacute;s que de los espa&ntilde;olitos).<br /><br />Y en cuanto a ignorantes, fueron espa&ntilde;olitos los que me han preguntado si yo vivo \\"en la misma California\\", si conozco a muchos artistas de cine, si all&iacute; han o&iacute;do hablar de la Semana Santa de Sevilla...  La estrechez de miras no es patrimonio americano, y Verd&uacute; es el mejor ejemplo de ello.<br /><br />Verd&uacute; se queja de que los desayunos son descomunales.  Recuerdo un viejo refr&aacute;n espa&ntilde;ol: \\"Desayuna como un rey, almuerza como un pr&iacute;ncipe, y cena como un mendigo\\".  Tambi&eacute;n nos describe sus pat&eacute;ticas experienciassexuales con las americanas, y se permite el lujo de generalizar basado en su amplia experiencia: a las espa&ntilde;olas les gusta m&aacute;s el sexo.  &iquest;No ser&iacute;a que a las americanas les gustaste bien poco?  Y por cierto, &iquest;cu&aacute;ntas americanas conociste con padres neonazis?  Otra gran decepci&oacute;n que me llev&eacute; fue la afirmaci&oacute;n de que la comida de Thanksgiving es \\"asquerosa\\".  Otra vez, donde se ponga una buena tortilla de papas que se quite todo lo dem&aacute;s.

This novel is of special significance to me, and this is why I decided to re-read it, something I never do.  While still in college at Fresno State, I worked at an agricultural research station for a couple of years.  I remember the beautiful view of the sierras from our building.  I also remember the heat at 3 pm in the summer, when you are out in the orchard collecting data.  I witnessed the excitement that the opening of a MacDonald's in the next town created.  The country music, the Southern drawl remaining from Oakie heritage, the tractor dealerships and fertilizer shops, the rigors of scientific research...<br /><br />This is why this book resonates so much with me.  From a geographical and cultural standpoint, this is as realistic as it gets.<br /><br />I am not much of a mystery reader, but to me this book was the vehicle for two great things: the reminiscing it provided me, and the excellent storytelling abilities of the writer, Rebecca Rothenberg.  I did a search on her on the web, and learned that she had an untimely death in 1998 due to a brain tumor.  She was an avid botanist, and apparently, at her 50th birthday party, just a few weeks before her passing, she said that there were thousands of native California plants she could continue using for her mysteries.  The Bulrush Murders was the first in a series, followed by The Dandelion Murders, the Shy Tulip Murders, and The Tumbleweed Murders (finished by another friend author, Taffy Cannon).	2005-04-25
US	52987300	RQ9VCKTUQAXTA	0312150601	240594756	Behind the Scenes at the Museum: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	I am a precious jewel	WOW!  I think this is what book critics may call \\"a tour de force\\".  Ruby narrates the story from the very moment of her conception.  The book starts: \\"I exist!  I am conceived to the chimes of midnight on the clock on the mantelpiece...\\"<br /><br />Ruby is the youngest daughter of a neurotic mother and a philandered father.  The complex relationships she has with every member of her family and extended family go beyond the present.  This is the vivid story of a complex saga, spanning about 100 years, where you can find many themes.  One of the strongest is how a missing mother can impact generations of people down the line.  How hard it is to break the chain!  The family dynamics are worthy of a thesis on neglect and emotional abuse.  Another theme: nothing lasts forever, and what today is up may tomorrow be down.  <br /><br />I very much enjoyed the structure of the book.  Each chapter (which deals with Ruby's life in chronological order) has a footnote.  For example, in chapter 1, Gillian (Ruby's high-strung sister) is playing with a pink-glass, flower-shaped button (see Footnote (i)).  Each footnote deals with the past, way past.  Footnote (i) explains the significance of that button.  And so forth for the remaining 13 chapters.<br /><br />I found it useful to mark whenever i found a mention of a footnote, so that i could come back to it later on after reading such footnote.  Somehow it completed the meaning better.<br /><br />A cool idea would have been to start a genealogical tree, and to add to it as we find out what has happened to the many members of this family.  This is a book you need to read in one go.  If you stop and leave it for a few days and go back to it, you may find it very confusing.  There are many characters, and it is easy to miss the thread.  The characters are very complex and beautifully portrayed. While many of them are not beautiful at all, one of the strengths of this book is to show people with no artifice, as good and as bad as we all are.<br /><br />Chapter 4 was very confusing to me.  Do not despair!  Everything will become crystal clear later on.  The book is never sappy, and Ruby's voice is never gloomy, as much as her environment may be.as we all are. <br /> <br />Chapter 4 was very confusing to me. Do not despair!

The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing made me think immediately of Bridget Jones and company, all those books about women who wonder why oh why can't I find the man of my dreams.<br /><br />Besides this very trivial title hides a collection of short stories unlike any other I have read.  I was so absorbed by this book that I would try to sneak as much reading time as possible, to the frustration of my husband, who would call from downstairs, \\"Are you read yet?  We're late!\\".  Almost all of the short stories are about Jane, from the time she's about 14 and becomes awestruck with her older brother's cool girlfriend, till she's a professional woman in NYC, making sense of her love life in her own terms.  There are one or two stories interspersed in the narrative that do not touch on Jane per se, but that in no way detract from the flow.  This is almost a novel with a couple detours.<br /><br />Sometime before a book begins, the author includes a quote from a poem, or from another novel, and in the vast majority of cases I fail to grasp the significance of it, even after reading the whole book.  The set of quotes that precedes every short story in this book is brilliant, and fits perfectly.<br /><br />Hands down, one of the most satisfying and tender books i've read in a long time.	2005-03-28
US	52987300	R126IJQW8B0T9G	0743255429	19059970	The Hornet's Nest: A Novel of the Revolutionary War	Books	1	9	13	N	N	I tried, I tried, but I finally had to give up	From a historical perspective, this is a great book.  it is obvious that Mr. Carter has researched the subject.  The book is full of interesting insights about how life must have been in the 1770s.  But, this is not a history text book, or a non-fiction account.  This is a novel, and the creative part of it is what has disappointed me to the point that I won't make it past page 173.  The characters are very one-dimensional.  Ethan, the main character, is so stiff to the point of being terribly unlikeable.  Elijah Clarke is an overgrown bully.  The plot moves slowly and without any spice.  The action is so painfully slow!  The funny part is that much to the chagrin of Mr. Carter, the book was reduced in length by his editors.<br /><br />I have read historical fiction before, and at times it has had a thriller aspect to it that made me look forward to the next chance to read.  All that was absent here.  I am sure that if the author had been someone other than a past president, this novel would have never seen the light.	2005-02-21

It shows two smiling girls, both wearing knitted sweaters.  It makes me think that this photo comes from a knitting magazine or pattern book.  The photo sets the theme for this collection of short stories, all of which feature children and/or adolescents.  I am not sure the title of this books truly reflects what happens in these stories.<br /><br />* How I lost my Vocation<br /><br />Francis is a devout Catholic and a very observant boy, and he notices that his parents are not very happy.  During summer at the beach house, with Catholic Granny sick and Aunt Rose coming to visit, Francis manages to lose his vocation.  The second part to this story is the very last one, \\"Indian Summer\\", where an older Francis narrates the aftermath of his parent's divorce and shows his loyalties in a very mature way.<br /><br />* Canada<br /><br />Rather clich&eacute;y story about a mother feeling smothered by her family life.  Her escape is to dream about Canada, so vast and with so many square miles between people.<br /><br />* The Pleasure Gardens<br /><br />Again a story that I found slightly clich&eacute;y.  The main topic in the story is the coming-of-age of the narrator, who is 13.  She does that both in a gentle way, by falling in love with a boy at the same time her father is contemplating a move to another city, and brutally, by being the unwilling witness to sexual abuse in the house of her best friend.<br /><br />* Greengages<br /><br />Story told dually by mother and daughter.  This was my favorite, because it shows the unfortunate rifts that grow between people that should love each other so much, yet they are so encumbered by those rifts and don't grasp the opportunities that come to knock them down.<br /><br />*Granville Hill<br /><br />A girl talks about her sister, who died from leukemia.  She struggled from her feelings of jealousy at all the attention her sick sister was getting, to the feeling of guilt after her death.<br /><br />* Paradise Drive<br /><br />Another story with two narrators, Jon and Alison.  Foster parents take in a juvenile delinquent who loves stealing hot cars (Jon).  The problem is the parent's 16-year old daughter (Alison) gets jealous.  Not a happy ending.<br /><br />*Bare<br /><br />OK, maybe my favorite story after all.  Dad brings girlfriend to meet daughter and ex-wife (Bea).  Bea wants to be extra nice for the sake of the girl, but girlfriend is a real bitcharoonie on the sly. Bea is so perceptive that she picks up all the clues.  I liked that writing. Bea feels depressed and unfulfilled, and gets a life-cleansing tattoo.  I liked the honesty that Bea has with herself.<br /><br />* The Bounce<br /><br />Historical piece!  A woman lion-tamer spends some time in Ireland and gets involved with a farmer, and life gets very complicated for all involved.  The narrators are the husband and wife, many, many years later.Drive <br />Another story with two narrators, Jon and Alison.

US	52987300	R10F8072LM1STP	0312195532	708780160	Ruby	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The title should be "Olivia"	Ann Hood should be declared a saint by all married men (along with Dr. Laura since she published The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands last year).  The main character in Ruby is not Ruby, is Olivia.  She had been married for only a few months when her husband is killed while jogging.  That very morning, when he tried to get intimate, Olivia shunned him away, and suggested that he go for a run.  After his death, this is a regret that Olivia cannot shake away.  Many a woman (including me) will heed her implied advice after reading this book.<br /><br />So Olivia is devastated and goes to their summer house on the coast in Rhode Island to prepare it for sale.  While there, she meets Ruby.  Ruby is 15 going on 40, and very pregnant.  Olivia starts fantasizing about keeping Ruby's baby, as it had been hers and David's dream to have a child.  But Ruby is a bit of a con-artist, and the process is not going to be smooth sailing.<br /><br />The beauty about the story is not so much about Olivia getting the baby as it is about Olivia getting a family.  It was heartwarming to see the evolution of Olivia and Ruby's relationship, from distrust, to antagonism, to acceptance, to full support.  I loved the ending.<br /><br />I wasn't too happy about a few unsatisfying details in the story:<br /><br />* David falling in love at first sight with Olivia, the milliner who sold him the hat he was supposed to give to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day.  He gave her the hat and proceeded to break up with her.  How shallow!  I never warmed up to him.<br /><br />* Olivia's unrealistic retreat to the beach house in RI.  She has a business to run and an apartment in NYC, yet she has the means to close them up without subletting.  Was she so independently wealthy?<br /><br />* There is a three-year-old in the story that says things like: \\"We've never eaten in here. [...] Honest to God, we never eat in here.  Not in a million years\\".  OK, how many three-year-olds do you know that say \\"we've never eaten\\"?  I know many an adult that says \\"we've never ate\\".<br /><br />* Olivia and Ruby's fight in the parking lot at the A&W.  No matter how stoned those kids were, no one came to Ruby's defense?<br /><br />* Rex's visit to the beach house in the middle of the night.  Hmmm...<br /><br />* The cassette tape.  I will not into details so as not to spoil this part.<br /><br />In any event, this was a pretty good novel, that read like a breeze.  I don't think it is stellar, but I enjoyed the pace.  The style reminded me a bit of Laurie Colwin's fabulous novels, maybe because of the New England setting, maybe because the simple, fresh dialog, maybe because of the strong women friendships.that say \\"we've never eaten\\"?

En la primera Julio tiene unos 14 a&ntilde;os.  Se enferma y tiene fiebres tan altas que empieza a delirar.  Su padre hizo una vez un comentario acerca de su falta de afici&oacute;n a la lectura: \\"&eacute;l asegur&oacute; que el d&iacute;a menos pensado, si persist&iacute;a en no leer, los libros saldr&iacute;an volando de casa, como p&aacute;jaros, y nos quedar&iacute;amos todos sin palabras\\".  Bueno, pues Julio empieza a vivir dos realidades.  En la causada por su delirio, los libros escapan, y la gente empieza a perder el vocabulario, y surge una especie de mercado negro.  Julio pasa de una realidad a otra sin mucho problema.<br /><br />La segunda parte nos muestra a un Julio adulto y periodista.  Sus padres se han divorciado, y su padre ha sufrido una embolia y est&aacute; en el hospital.  Es pronto evidente que Julio sigue viviendo dos realidades distintas, hasta el punto de que el mismo lector se confunde y no puede decir cu&aacute;l es la real y cu&aacute;l la imaginada.<br /><br />Este es, desde luego, un libro distinto.  Hay algunas cosas que me hicieron mucha gracia, como la l&oacute;gica del joven Julio en lo que se refiere al orden alfab&eacute;tico.  No considero a &eacute;ste un tipo de novela para leer todos los d&iacute;as, pero merece la pena refrescarse en su in&eacute;dita perspectiva.	2005-01-24

Tom Paine's airbrushed face is on the jacket, and oh boy, he looks like he fell asleep in a tanning booth.  That, combined with the Abercrombie & Fitch styling predisposed me not to like this book.<br /><br />But the writing did not help either!  The first story is about a wealthy man caught in a hurricane while sailing.  His boat sinks and he is rescued by a group of Haitians floating their way to the US in very dire conditions.  These poor people believe that by rescuing an American they will have no trouble being accepted in the country.  But the way things turn out is very different.<br /><br />The second story is what really did me in.  A burly Marine general, on the day of his retirement, decides to \\"come out\\" by undressing to his female underwear during his farewell banquet.<br /><br />There was something so contrived and forced in that story that i couldn't take it any more.  Like the critic who got up in the middle of a play said, \\"I don't need to eat the whole omelette in order to tell you that the eggs were rotten\\".	2004-12-28

She was so selfish and so dishonest with herself that I simply couldn't empathise.<br /><br />Jo is a veterinarian.  She is married to a minister, has three grown daughters and lives a quiet life in a small Massachusetts community.  When she was in her early twenties and married to a different man, she experienced some sort of crisis and took off on everybody.  She ended up in Cambridge, where she lived in a big house with a group of students.  This one-year hiatus from reality was precious and meant the world to her.  Unfortunately, that unbelievable year came crashing when one of the roommates, her best friend Dana, was killed in mysterious circumstances.<br /><br />Fast forward to the present.  Because of one of those silly coincidences that life brings us, one of Jo's old roommates moves into her town, almost 30 years later.  This was like stirring some long-settled sediment at the bottom of a pool.  Jo experienced a mixture of dread and appeal, maybe because she was transported to that time, back in her 20s, where she felt free and unencumbered.  Unfortunately, she allowed herself to be dragged by her emotions (which is what she had done her entire life), and in the process managed to alienate everyone, most importantly her husband.<br /><br />I realized early on how things were going to turn out.  The big question, the whodunit, became crystal clear soon.  That disappointed me a little, but I forgave the author.  After all, this is not a mystery novel.  The main theme is not who killed Dana, but what a mess Jo has made of her life and her relationships.<br /><br />A couple of things I liked:<br /><br />This one because it rings true:<br /><br />\\"Having children teaches you, I think that love can survive your being despised in every aspect of yourself.  That you need not collapse when the shriek comes: Don't you get it?  I hate you!  But you do need to get it.  You do need to understand and accept being hated.  I think this is one of the greatest gifts children can give you, as long as it doesn't last\\".<br /><br />This one because it reflects what a sorry human being Jo is:<br /><br />\\"But then he returned and our life went on.  Three days gone.  A week.  I measured the time in the faint waning of my consciousness of my misery, and wondered if this would one day be enough: simply not to be consciously miserable anymore\\".t being hated.

Frans Hals was a XVII century Dutch painter, a contemporary of Rembrandt and Vermeer.  His alleged diaries are discovered buried in a farm in upstate NY.  Peter, a perpetual and therefore somewhat flaky graduate student, fluent in Dutch, is hired to translate them.  The book alternates from Hals' crazy life to Peter's crazy life.<br /><br />I loved Hals, and throughout the book Peter falls for him too and takes a very personal and emotional interest on the authenticity of the diaries.  The book can almost be categorized as a \\"thriller\\" because there is definitively a sense of mystery and urgency in it.<br /><br />One thing I did not understand: whenever the focus was on Hals, the writing was superb:<br /><br />* who would have thought of using the word `escutcheon' in that context?!  (Read the book and you will understand!)<br /><br />* Same thing for `retiring', as in `Corwin being extremely retiring and unable simply to state the problem and get an answer [...]'<br /><br />* `I am not sure I can bring myself to love a God who limits our intelligence but not our stupidity'.<br /><br />* `Besides, like most children, they are a hard lot when it comes to aged parents.  The cruelty of good sense'.<br /><br />But when Peter was on, the writing became somewhat amateurish.  The language was simplistic, and there was very little depth given to certain aspects of Peter's life.  For example, when he escaped to see his brother for the weekend, the entire episode is described in a mere couple of paragraphs.  It felt almost like the author had used all his best juices for Hals' parts, and then for Peter's parts there was nothing left.<br /><br />The ending was slightly abrupt for my taste, but all is well that ends well, so I was left a happy camper.  I am very thankful for all the photos of the paintings.  It really helped understand Hals.<br /><br />For the record, this book was published in 1994, way before Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier.  I haven't read it, but I saw the movie, and got the impression that life in Holland in the XVII century could not have been that steamy.  Well, after reading The Lost Diaries of Frans Hals, I think my impression was wrong.k was published in 1994, way before Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier.

US	52987300	R1STYFSXOU08EY	0385319207	10089389	One True Thing	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Death to typecasting!	I have read two books by Anna Quindlen back to back, which is something i never do.  I like to mix it up, but in this case i enjoyed Black and Blue so much i decided to continue with her.  This novel did not disappoint me at all.  It was beautifully written, and at the core was a subject that i have rolled around my head time and time again.  No, it is not euthanasia.  It is the tendency we have to categorize people based on surface characteristics.  Ellen, the narrator, is a victim of it.  Kate, her mother, is another victim.  Ellen realizes too late the dear price you have to pay for typecasting people into roles and personalities which were simply mere facets of an otherwise complex character.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed with Ellen becoming a doctor.  I thought the story would have been more rounded if she had turned into another Teresa Guerrero.  By the way, it would be wonderful if Anna Q spun another novel with Teresa as the main role.<br /><br />The family dynamics were portrayed to perfection.  The humorous moments between the siblings, for example, were quite dull, yet they found them hilarious.  That is a sign of the awkward dynamics that existed within the family.  Those private jokes were so silly that only the dysfunctional children of a remote scholar and Eleanor Roosevelt undercover as Martha Stewart could produce.<br /><br />Still, a wonderful book.  I enjoyed it so much that i will never see the movie adaptation.  I have a really hard time picturing Renee Zellweger as Ellen.  Ouch!	2004-11-23

Anne Quindlen knows how to tell a story.<br /><br />Fran, the main character, is a battered woman. This is a term she hates, we learn later on. The story begins with her escape. She's had it, the last beating was too much, and she is escaping her husband with the help of a group that places women undercover. She is taking her son, and ends up in Central Florida. Fran's feelings are perfectly articulated. She writes about her ambivalence for her husband, who happens to be a NYC cop. She also writes about the dingy apartment, her sense of loss, the daily details that made (and make) her life miserable. Piece by piece she starts rebuilding her life in Florida. She makes friends, gets a job as a nurse's aide (she was an RN before), and takes it one day at a time. In the process, even though there is no complete healing, she learns a few things about herself and her son. <br /><br />The cast of characters is terrific. There's Cindy, Fran's first friend in Florida. Although she is a Floridian, she is the archetype of a Californian bimbette. But there's tremendous depth to Cindy, and I love the way this is revealed to the reader, little by little. Mrs. Leavitt is a key character, providing perspective and resignation achieved not just by her old age, but also by her terrible past. I did not fall for Mike, the same way Fran didn't. Above all, I enjoyed Fran, with her beautiful imperfections.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to get to the ending of the book. There is a thriller-like feel to the story, because you know the cop husband is looking for them, and it's not going to be pretty once he finds Fran. The end surprised me and left me a little sad, but hopeful. Time goes by, and children grow up.	2004-10-28

The main difference is that in Joanna the story takes place in the early XX century and the characters are educated upper class English women. In AYRIBW the story takes place in the later part of XX century, and the characters are poorly educated, downright poor Indian women.<br /><br />That said, both novels are wonderful reads in their own rights. Joanna is terrific in that the three narrators elicit very strong emotions on the reader. You cannot help but hate Kitty, sympathize with Joanna and feel pity for Florence. Hers being the last chapter brings a deep understanding of how things happened the way they happened.	2004-10-21

The Last Jew is the story of Yonah Toledano, who truly seems to be the last Jew in Spain after the expulsion in 1492.  The book starts with Yonah being only 13 years old.  His brother is killed, soon his father is too, and Yonah wanders throughout the country, first escaping, then trying to make a living.  The book ends when he is 33 years old, after many, many adventures.  This was an entertaining book, although at times a bit unnerving.<br /><br />For example, there were many mistakes in the spelling of Spanish names.  Maybe I should offer my services as an editor, because really, consistency is not that difficult.  Yonah himself gets his name spelled Jonah on the jacket!  Bernardo becomes Bernado, Ana Montalb&aacute;n becomes Montelban, Isabel turns into Isobel, etc...  It is bad already if you mangle the names of your characters, but even in the acknowledgments there are a couple of people who may be thinking that this Noah Gordon is a careless dork.<br /><br />Speaking of names, it was a good idea to name the evil villain Inquisitor Bonestruca.  Sounds like what he did for a living.<br /><br />I loved the part about the Jocs Florals, where the second and third prizes are a gold rose and a silver violet, but the first prize is a real rose, because \\"nothing made by humans could surpass a flower made by God\\".  In this very competitive society we live in, wouldn't that be a terrific lesson to teach our children?  Can you imagine a school competition, where the kids area actually rooting to get second place?<br /><br />This book is also home to one of the most ill-written sentences I've ever encountered:  \\"Her thick-lipped pudenda was a small animal with a wild brown pelt\\".<br /><br />I liked the map of Spain listing the travels he made.  But the map is incomplete, and what's with the dotted lines?  As much as I've thought about it, I cannot figure out their significance.<br /><br />This book is quite engaging, but slightly simplistic in its approach to historical fiction, and in the same way that the names are sometimes misspelled, the facts are muddled at times.  For example, the book says that \\"Henry IV of Castilla had no sons [...] but he had a daughter, Juana, believed to have been the illegitimate child of Henry's mistress, Beltr&aacute;n de la Cueva\\".  No, no, no.  For starters, Beltr&aacute;n de la Cueva was a man.  Henry's wife, Juana, is said to have had a daughter, also named Juana, with Beltr&aacute;n de la Cueva.  This is why in Spanish history the younger Juana is known as La Beltraneja.  Henry wanted to name her his heir, but noblemen didn't like that, and supported Henry's youngest brother Alfonso, who one day appeared dead.  Eventually, Isabel La Cat&oacute;lica (what you Americans know as Isabella, even though she was not Italian), who was Henry's sister, became Queen of Castilla.  This is all very simple stuff, that you learn in the third grade or so.<br /><br />If this is a genre you enjoy, then you must read Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte.  He is a master writer, who understands history and brings the context alive with rich and complex characters.is quite engaging, but slightly simplistic in its approach to historical fiction, and in the same way that the names are sometimes misspelled, the facts are muddled at times.

Maybe it was because i started it believing it was a memoir. When i then read the contrived jacket, i learned it was a work of fiction: \\"Dark, humorous, and exquisitely haunting, his final book of fiction...\\". In the book, the writer reveals that his birthday was January 30, his daughter married without his approval, he hated traveling, etc. I had never before heard about Richard Brautigan, so i did a bit of research. What a surprise to find out that he was born on January 30, his daughter married without his approval, he hated to travel, and so on. So this work of \\"fiction\\" turned to be pretty autobiographical after all.<br /><br />The style of the book is certainly different to anything i have ever read before. The narrative is almost what you would hear in a conversation. There are many artificial segments interspersed here and there. For example, \\"Maybe i'll describe what I have been doing since I interrupted or was interrupted writing this book nine days ago...\\" He goes on to describe a dream, and then all of a sudden 14 days have passed and he says the book is \\"mischevious and grows more and more to follow the way life works out\\". How helpless.<br /><br />Another aspect of the writing that i did not like at all is the self-indulgence that permeates it. \\"I got a glass of wine as I said I would - interruption for a Montana nature break. I just felt something dimly crawling on my arm\\". And he goes for an entire page talking about a spider. The last page, where he thanks the company that made the notebook, is another example.<br /><br />So sorry about Brautigan. The expression \\"pobre hombre\\" comes to mind when i think of him. What a painful existence he must have lived. But, no matter how fanciful or different your writing style is, that doesn't make it art. Others have explored the subject of death in a far more compelling, delicate, articulate manner. Brautigan's vision was ultimately selfish, the way he was with his daughter, his relationships, his friends. And it shows.ultimately selfish, the way he was with his daughter, his relationships, his friends. And it shows. <br /> <br />	2004-09-17

Perhaps because the first story set the tone: the bride is too young to know what she is doing, and marries the groom in a whim and then regrets is dearly. I must admit that the story was well written, because it transmitted the sense of defeat and despair that a young woman in a foreign country and a loveless marriage must feel.<br /><br />One of the stories, Black Train, has an interesting passage: \\"All &eacute;migr&eacute;s have the same basic story to tell: there is that small death when they leave their home country, there is that short-lived euphoria when it looks like they've been blessed with a chance to rewrite their scripts in a free society, and then comes the life-long sadness once they realize that they have made an irreversible choice to cut themselves off from their roots. They can appear successful and lead exciting lives - but they will always feel like second-class citizens, wherever they are. And that huge void inside will never, ever be filled.\\"<br /><br />This got me thinking, because i am an &eacute;migr&eacute;, yet i don't subscribe to those thoughts. Maybe if i had left my country for political reasons, and could never go back, but in this day and age, where you can be on the opposite corner of the world in a matter of hours, where's the trouble? As time goes by, boundaries blur and distances shorten. This reminds me of a long-forgotten song, titled \\"My Country, my shoes\\".	2004-09-09

Jennifer Egan truly remembers her teenage years well.<br /><br />But Phoebe's is not your garden variety angst.  She is marred by the deaths of her father and her older sister Faith.  Her father she worshipped from a distance (as it was his choice). Phoebe also worshipped Faith, but especially after her death, to the point where she borrows the remains of her life: she sleeps in her room, she wears her clothes, she has no identity of her own.<br /><br />After high school graduation Phoebe goes (escapes) on a journey across Europe, trying to figure out what happened to her sister.  Along the way, she runs into her sister's old boyfriend, Wolf, and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place as if by magic.<br /><br />Everything makes sense after the trip to Italy.  Phoebe sheds her previous skin and embraces her new future.  Wolf grieves and purges the regrets he had inside.  There is a final resolution for everyone involved.<br /><br />Some of the things i did not like so well about the book:<br /><br />* At the very beginning, there were times where Phoebe was too adult (when in fact she was 5-6 years old).  For example, she got so angry at Faith for diving from the highest board at the country club swimming pool.  So young and already able to articulate her jealousy?  Another example is when she witnessed her brother Barry ask their dad for help with a machine.  The dad, who liberally ignored the two youngest kids, would seem distracted and in consequence disappoint Barry.  Phoebe is able to express in her mind how Barry shouldn't even go there, as \\"she pitied her brother and wanted no part of his weakness\\".<br /><br />* Why does Barry make a fortune in Silicon Valley about a decade too soon?<br /><br />* Phoebe's encounter with Wolf is too contrived.  Europe is huge for this chancy meeting to take place.<br /><br />Some of the things i truly loved:<br /><br />* Phoebe in all her awkwardness.  She can be a total brat, she can be sensitive and pure in a way that only children can.<br /><br />* I loved the analysis of the Hippie Generation of the 60s.  What happened to the ideals?  What happens when you grow older and look back?  The loss of innocence was devastating for Faith.<br /><br />* The cover, the tattered photograph of the two girls held together by tape.<br /><br />* The end.  It was perfect, it was devoid of sentimentality, and I loved it for that.<br /><br />When i read Look at Me (which i really liked), i searched for the author on the web.  I found her website.  I wrote a note saying i enjoyed the book very much, and that hoped to attend any talks taking place in my area.

It's one thing to make Teddy Roosevelt one of your main characters, but to give him such silly dialog is quite another.<br /><br /> Although this book is amusing and useful in picking up ridiculously trivial factoids (did you ever know that Churchill's father contracted syphillis while a student at Oxford?), it is not worth my time when there are so many piles of books around me screaming &quot;Read ME!!!&quot;	2004-08-06

Poor Oscar is a wiener dog who gets dissed by all the other dog-bullies at school.

But before the night is over he will show everyone what a hero he truly is.<br /><br /> This story is just funny from beginning to end. I love the little details: did anyone notice the mailbox in front of Oscar's house? They are the Myers!

This book, on the other hand, is very satisfying.<br /><br /> The two main characters, Hartmann and Fibich, are children in Nazi Germany when they are smuggled to England. They both arrive at a boarding school, where they endure not just the regular hardships expected in any boarding school situation, but the stigma of being German in post-WWII England. Having no one to turn but each other for support, they form a bond stronger than if they were brothers.<br /><br /> Their personalities are completely opposite. Hartmann does not care to reminisce about the past, and is very successful at banning any negative or depressing memory. Even the woman he chooses to marry is a perfect example of vacuity.<br /><br /> Fibich, on the other hand, is tormented by a past he cannot exactly put together, and toys with the constant idea of a trip to Berlin, to find his roots. At the same time, he is terrified of the future, and cannot seem to enjoy anything. His wife is melancholy personified.<br /><br /> The book relates the two men's beginnings, their youth, and in summary the development of their 50-year friendship. This is not an action-packed novel, and in fact there is very little dialog, so this may not be the best choice for someone looking for a dynamic novel. However, this is a very touching portray of a friendship, where wedding vows were not uttered, but were practiced.	2004-07-27

The story starts with Charlotte the model having a car accident. Her retrospective view into childhood and adolescence set the tone for the remainder of the book. You learn that Charlotte is not a nice person. In fact, she is a royal bitch. The reasons are unimportant. Soon other characters start entering the book. Charlotte's best friend in high school, Ellen, has a daughter named Charlotte as well (i won't spoil my suspected reason as to why the namesake). This younger Charlotte is very smart and an ugly duckling, and gets drawn to two men, one in a sexual way, and the other in more of a puzzle-solving urge way. And then the story gets very complicated.<br /><br /> Honestly, at first i failed to see the connection between everybody. I started reading this book because it has the &quot;National Book Award Finalist&quot; seal on the front, but after a while i had to wonder what was so great about it. I kept feeling annoyed at what i judged to be very convenient coincidences along the plot. Then everything became clear, and i understood how all the pieces fell together.<br /><br /> Some of the things i really enjoyed about the book:<br /><br /> *The Shadow Self theory by Charlotte the model<br /><br /> *The mirror room<br /><br /> *General commentary on how we are a society driven by image and consumism<br /><br /> *The huge cast of characters and how everybody fits well within the plot<br /><br /> *The misunderstandings between Moose and Charlotte the teenager<br /><br /> *The clairvoyance regarding Z's role in the US. Jennifer Egan has an afterword in which she explains the timing of the book. Unbelievable!<br /><br /> Some of the things i did not enjoy:<br /><br /> *Charlotte the teenager speaks and thinks like an adult. Wrong! The scene where she goes to Michael's house to be seduced requires more willing suspension of disbelief than if she had flown there on a donkey.<br /><br /> *Michael is a confusing character, in some ways a little difficult to swallow. Could he truly speak with any accent at all? And he blows it all in order to go write movie scripts? Was this done to keep a perfect balance? After all, Charlotte the model goes from stardom down to Earth. Therefore, a minion must then move from Earth up to the stars? Or is he fighting the revolution from within?on a donkey. <br />  <br /> *Michael is a confusing character, in some ways a little difficult to swallow. Could he truly speak with any accent at all?

The 13 year-old narrator, Alison, floats around the many members of her family during one of the dryest summers in the history of England, making very perceptive observations about all of them.  Because her dad ruined his brain thanks to too much cider, her oldest brother Ian runs the farm, helped by brother Tom and the guidance of Grandfather.  Alison becomes friends with a boy her age, Jonathan, and they spend a summer of discovery.  A parellel story is the tender romance between the Rector and Maria, the Portuguese lady.  The Rector is a sweet, sweet man, far less in control of himself than he thinks.<br />I loved the humor (the Green is renamed \\"The Brown\\", because all the grass dried up).  I loved the dialect (\\"bay\\" for \\"boy\\").  I wish i could have been in Alison's shoes when i was 13.	2004-07-17

The narrator, Peter, has been suspecting for a while that his son may not be his. When he finally takes a DNA test and his suspicions get confirmed, the seemingly normal relationships he had with his ex-wife and son unravel into a huge mess.  Peter, as self-deprecating as he portrays himself to be, becomes an endearing character, and of course you root for him from the get-go.<br />The writing is quite good. One of my favorite examples is: &quot;The moment I started talking I had to check my voice to find that pitch that I used on police officers and bureaucrats, giving them just enough deference to let them know that I wouldn't challenge their authority as long as they didn't try to exercise it in any way I'd find inconvenient. It was a pitch you could find when you were a middle-aged guy in a suit, and occasionally it compensated for the high blood pressure and lower life expectancy&quot;.<br />This book reads fast, and it portrays very well the agony that children of divorce have to face. I would classify this novel under the category of  &quot;Thriller&quot;, because you get hooked into knowing how the situation is going to resolve. I won't spoil the ending, but i was quite satisfied with it.	2004-06-14

The storyline was equally aggravating. This could have easily been the plot of a high-school movie: newcomer (Mukundan) is scared and wants nothing more than belong.

But when the \\"in\\" clique starts paying attention to the newcomer, he mistreats those who care about him.

This may be a simplistic summary of the novel, but tell me i'm wrong!  What starts with some rather beautiful depictions of life in Haiti ends up being a collection of tortured life accounts.  The common thread is that all the tortured characters are women.  In the eyes of the author, this suffering saga started generations before, and it is being perpetuated along with every new woman that is born.  The ones that are abused keep abusing, and do not know the way to escape that vicious circle.  Grandma If&eacute; was just the recipient of years of superstition and servitude, Aunt Tatie a spinster with a collection of unrequited love stories, Martine the abused/abuser and ghost fighter, Sophie the inadequate daughter and frigid wife...  What about the men?  They are too cool and composed, too perfect, too understanding (especially Joseph, Sophie's husband).  This book moves fast, years go by in a matter of three pages, and the pace is never slow.  However, it is depressing, there is no resolution to any conflict, no redemption of any kind.  The best parts are the vivid descriptions of Haiti, in all its poverty and grace.	2004-04-20

I read the first chapter (1972), and found it OK, but once the second one got going (1995), I started getting very irritated.  Walter came across as a malcontent whiny guy, and the characters so far had been less than enticing (Susan seemed slightly egotistical, and Lucy was way too perfect to be real).  Another thing that bothered me is the excruciating descriptions that the author goes through about the most minute details.  I could tolerate that level of detail when the story carries my interest (We Were The Mulvaneys by Joyce Carol Oates is a great example), but in this case I just had to glaze over whole paragraphs describing suburbian neighborhoods.  I hate it when I don't finish a book, so I decided to check Amazon reviews and see what other people had said.  I'm not so disappointed now.  To the author's credit, I didn't see the fact that Walter is gay right away.  However, the parallelisms between lesbian aunt Sue Rawson mentoring Walter in his ballet, and then Walter mentoring his niece on hers were too melodramatic.  The ending, which I only know about through other people's comments, makes me wonder if Jane Hamilton perhaps wrote this book with Oprah in mind.  I really enjoyed The Book of Ruth.  It was difficult to go through, but there was something true and compelling about the story and the characters.  In this case, though, I wasn't able to find any empathy for anyone or get driven to the story.	2004-04-01

After reading the last page of this book, I am left both with tremendous pity for his wife and children, and a tremendous sense of contempt for Boylan.  Not only they had to endure his selfishness, but on top of that he had to put in on writing.  I will never forget what John Irving wrote as foreword to his short story &quot;Almost in Iowa&quot;: &quot;writing about your divorce constitutes a different form of child abuse&quot;.  Well, eliminating the very last semblance of privacy for his family (for example, describing the last time he ands his wife made love) is as low as someone can get.  I imagine that with the expensive medical treatments and operations, a book deal was mandatory.<br />What a selfish individual.  His wife is who put it in best terms: he asked at one point how she was feeling, and she replied, &quot;does it matter?&quot;  I give Boylan credit in that he transcribes all this in the book, not hiding the fact of his selfish, self-centered behavior.  He forgot that once you bring human beings into this world, your life is not your own anymore.  How he manages to beautify his manipulation and end up convincing himself that this is what-had-to-be makes me sick.  \\"Realities ignored prepare their own revenge\\".<br />A friend asked him after his transformation if his sense of irony was the first thing to go.  Obviously not.  As a good-bye ceremony to his manhood, Boylan cannot choose anything better than peeing against a tree.  He uses his grandmother's silver to examine his son's stool, looking for a marble.  He writes a letter to NASA asking to be the first transsexual in space.  He even got a reply, and I resent him for eliciting a waste of my tax dollars.  I couldn't stand the self-congratulatory reproduction of all the great letters of support and admiration he received.  After her tirade against Nora Ephron, he covers all basis by excusing his exuberance with a &quot;sorry, but i'm going through my teenage years right now!&quot;<br />I closed the book feeling that Jim Boylan is just a vain and egotistical individual.

He says there are three types of successful unions: the \\"avoiders\\", where husband and wife never speak of their conflict, the \\"fighters\\", where they argue about anything and everything, and the \\"respectful\\", where civilized dialog is key.  Problems arise when husband and wife have different arguing styles.  With marriage counseling targeted to these differences, many unions can be saved from divorce.<br />Unfortunately for Lainey and David, the parents in Family Pictures, this advice came a little too late.  Lainey is passionate and dramatic.  David is cool and composed.  This book is a great study on John Gottman's theories.  This is not a book about autism at all.  Randall, the autistic child, is key to the story, because he sets the pace.  After all, the three main sections of the life of this family are pre-Randall, post-Randall, and Randall's aftermath.<br />This is not a story driven by a strong plot either.  This is a characters' book.  It is Lainey, Mack, Nina and David the ones that make this book what it is: not a book about a family with an autistic child, but a book that explores the devastation that divorce creates among children.  Sue Miller's portrayal of the children as teenagers was so spot-on, I would find myself nodding my head in agreement at times, or smiling a \\"so true\\".<br />I very much enjoyed Nina's narratives, especially the final connection she makes between her picture collage and her history (hence the title of the book).<br />Not a pretty book, not a pretty story.  It is long, jumpy and slightly depressing, but well written and honest.  This is my first Sue Miller book, and I want to read more of her work.	2004-03-10

It was difficult to follow. There were many characters, and sometimes they were the narrators, sometimes a narrator dealt with them, with little transition or indication. The whole novel is divided into a myriad of vignettes, at times way apart from one another.

Just by insulting someone they're not making a point.  \\"Easier said than done\\" is a good way to summarize Mort's view.  It is far more difficult to prove to your audience that a certain political figure may be an idiot than to just simply call him or her a name.<br />I couldn't help thinking about that when I started to read this book.  Al Franken is a very entertaining writer, and much of what he says I believe, but I think he sometimes takes an almost patronizing approach with his readers.  For example, on Chapter 22 (The Reagan Years: Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Liar) he shows some tables.  These tables have data that show how Reagan's economic policies favored the rich, not the poor, which is exactly the opposite than what Rush had claimed.  To further underline the fact that Rush had lied, Al writes in hand script, over the table, \\"What a d***!\\".  Why does he have to do that?  Are his readers so thick that they cannot figure that out by themselves?  I felt this slightly patronizing.<br />Yes, Rush is a whale, but can we please stop focusing on his looks?  That doesn't make him eviler.<br />Also, i couldn't help but get a little tired of Al tooting his own horn.  Yes, we know you have a great quarterback arm, and you are sooooo funny!  Stop writing about it, please!<br />Although the arguments in this book are not as compelling as the ones in \\"Lies and the Lying Liars...\\" (which by the way is a much better book), this is still worth a read.	2004-01-15

However,  there are many hanging threads that don't get resolved:<br />The fact that four brothers and sisters are still living together way into their thirties and late twenties was hard to swallow.  Except for towards the end, where things begin to unravel, there was never any conflict among them.<br />Other than Oliver, who had a girlfriend while in Chicago, the other three were probably still virgins.<br />I can understand the devastation that the older kids (especially Sam) may have suffered when their parents died, but the youngest two were pretty oblivious, yet they exhibited the same maladjusted traits of Sam.<br />The grandparents had strong and well-defined personalities.  I do not buy that the children received such a minimal impact in their upbringing from them.  The way they developed as adults, it's almost like they grew up in a vacuum with Sam as the figurehead.<br />We never find out what happened with Julia's stalker.  If it truly was Sam's old childhood friend, why was he so obsessed?  There was never any resolution.  Julia keeps living in NY (not scared anymore), but the stalker never resurfaces.<br />For a group of hilarious actors and writers, they certainly lived very dreadful lives.  There is zero humor in the book.<br />I couldn't imagine a TV comedy based on four people sitting at a table for 30 minutes being any fun.  As a theatrical troupe, maybe, but not on NBC.<br />The author could have dissipated my doubts by introducing some of the comedy dialog in the book, but that never happened.  There was nothing more offensive than reading about how funny Sam's writing was, but never seeing proof.	2004-01-11

She has a special instinct, and only kills those people with a stinking soul.  Her story develops alongside the psychiatrist-werewolf who is bent into controlling all those with lycanthropic disorder, a washed-up news anchor who breaks the story, his awful wife, plus an array of picturesque characters.  As there were so many, pages and pages will go without a mention of them.  For example, Sam, the news anchor, is absent from a good portion of the center pages, and he is a crucial figure.  The same thing happened with other minor characters, like Razz, Liz, Henry, etc.<br />I did not understand the title pun, as this doesn't really have much to do with Naked Lunch.  The novel was entertaining, easy to read, not very profound despite the good moral message.  Still, a good book to read right before going to bed.	2004-01-04

Unlike some family sagas, the storyline keeps flowing with each section.  We don't re-read the same events interpreted in a different way by a new character each time.<br />The book starts with Nina.  She is the most unlikeable of the three siblings, and maybe this is why the book was hard to enjoy in those first pages.  She is so conceited and confused, and has some sort of arrogant displicence over everybody, to a point where she feels tremendously alone.  She has a cold little heart, and I had no sympathy for her at all.<br />Section 2 is devoted to Kermit, the brother.  Kermit and Nina have had some kind of unspoken rivalry throughout their childhood.  Now that they are grown-up, Kermit almost done with college, it is clear that there are many unresolved issues between them, but Kermit, being smarter and definitively more honest, comes up on top.  He learns a lot about life once he leaves home, and develops into a shrewd but compassionate man.<br />Section 3 is for Marion, the youngest sister, not as smart as her older brother and sister, but with far more passion.  That is her greatest shortcoming, and she will jump from trouble to trouble without batting an eye.<br />The supporting cast of in-laws, relatives and friends provides a lot of color and interest to the novel.  It was also great to read about New York City in pre-WWII years.	2004-01-04

It all starts in the present, in the aftermath of something horrible, and Ruth starts telling the story of her life, as far back as she can remember.<br />The book opens with Ruth under the refuge of her aunt Sid, who reflects on how Ruth is intelligent, when in fact it was assumed she was an idiot.  Ruth blames it on her lack of education, on her poor vocabulary.  This is true: how many people cannot speak English properly and some assume they are dumb?<br />Ruth had an unfortunate childhood, with a cold mother and an absent father.  By the way, it took me a little while to realize May and Elmer were her parents, as Ruth chose to refer to them by their first names, not as mom and dad.  Ruth did not know any better, and fell for the first guy who paid attention to her.  Unfortunately, it happened to be Ruby.  Ruth and Ruby, what a couple!  She is perfectly fine with him being a lazy slob.  Her hunger for a normal life is so great that she can do without those ingredients that make your life normal.  Even after Ruby shows his true colors (I won't spoil the plot here), she excuses him and blames something else for his actions: drugs, his drowning accident, his father's beatings...  Her codependency on Ruby is so deep that Ruth gets mad at her brother and aunt after reading a letter where they describe her marriage as a disaster in the making.<br />This book was quite brutal and harsh.  Do not expect a happy ending.	2004-01-03

I must confess the title annoyed me somewhat for starters (not a good thing), but as i read along, i warmed up to the author.  Her tone is quite even and matter-of-fact, even at times when she had the right to be outraged.  She brought up the fact that it wasn't that long ago that women were blatantly discriminated in the workplace.  Her episode with PanAm and dental coverage for her husband happened not even 30 years ago!<br />Like all memoirs, it is virtually impossible not to toot your own horn a bit, but Ireland keeps her horn subtlety muted, with only occasional shining references to her achievements.<br />Once she became president of NOW, she had to move from FL to DC.  As it happens so often, dislocation is bad for relationships, and Ireland, married, soon became involved with someone else.  This episode also proved to me that people can fool themselves into believing whatever is convenient, and that intelligence has nothing to do with it.  How could she possibly have two intimate relationships and justify the validity of both?  Can you imagine a man coming up with the same logic?  He would be chastised by women all over the globe!  Patricia Ireland as a de-facto bigamist disappointed me.	2003-12-24

However, The Coalwood Way is an interesting read, especially for those who truly liked The Rocket Boys.<br />For one thing, i was a bit disappointed about the author's foreword.  He swears that even though the events in the book passed so long ago (1959), he remembers everything in tremendous detail.  If he hadn't said that, i wouldn't have even thought about it.  As a person with very bad memory, i don't believe him.<br />Some of the characters are described to a point that they almost seem caricatures.  I couldn't help think of Martin on The Simpsons when reading about Quentin.  Roy Lee reminded me of Elvis Presley in one of his cheesy movies.<br />The memoir almost redeemed itself in page 267 (chapter 27), when Sonny finally realizes what has been bugging him all along (here's something i wish i had done: jot down the items on Sonny's list as you read along).  That discovery makes the book worthwhile.  However, the memoir ends with the Christmas Pageant, and that image really ruined the moment for me.	2003-12-14

It all starts with Davis leaving Scotland for Canada, not so much to find a living, but to escape the stifling constraints of tradition.  Then Hilda, his daughter, left her past in Regina and moved to Toronto.  Hilda's daughter, Danielle, needs to escape her mother, who is larger than life without even trying, and in order to find hr own identity, moves to Paris.  There she falls in love with Osman, who has also abandoned his native England escaping a sad childhood.  And so it goes...<br />The first chapters of the book are definitively for the impatient reader, as the author does not spend too much time recreating scenes or circumstances.  There is a certain economy of language, and the flow hassles through.  Once we get to Paris, the pace slows down, and we get to savor the intricacies of the characters.  I enjoyed this book, and identified especially with Danielle's character.  I did not appreciate the common use of archetypes that the author used, though, above all when it came to define French or Canadian people. Still, this is well worth a read.	2003-12-01

What could I have expected?  Still, the long passages where the intricacies of sword fishing were explained really bored me.  I very much disliked the glorification that the author made of the crew members.  The fact of the matter is that they were just a bunch of maladjusted men (may they rest in peace).  Please do not think of the word \\"hero\\" when describing the crew.  The only heroes were the National Guard rescue crew, because they did risk their lives in order to save others.  Bobby, Billy and company were no heroes (this is the most corrupted word in today's language).<br />I did watch the movie, hoping for some color.  Somehow, the storm representations did not have the same vividness in a page than on the screen.  The movie has some typical Hollywood defects, like once again the prettifying of the crew, their glorious lives, etc, etc.<br />I liked the map!	2003-11-19

If so, I wasn't able to figure it out.<br />Not all girls are made of sugar and spice.  Some can be manipulative, destructive, conniving, all while keeping the sweetest facade.  Kate, the narrator, is torn between the incredible admiration she feels for her father, and the stifling atmosphere he creates.  Her father is a preacher (the fire and brimstone kind), and he expects nothing but the best from his daughter.  Unfortunately, Kate is already way behind in his expectations, as she is not (and will never be) perfect, due to an unspoken accident she suffered when she was a little child.<br />Kate is reaching an age where feelings of independence and a strong sense of self are taking over, and figures out that if she brings home a \\"challenging\\" friend, Lydia, her dad would be entertained \\"converting\\" her.  But her plan backfires.  Lydia falls in awe with her dad.  Kate gets to know Lydia better, and she herself falls in awe with her mother.  So there you have it, two teenage girls envying each other.<br />I think the ending was a bit predictable, but Kate's resolve wasn't.  I enjoyed the writing style and flow of the book, and would read this author again.<br />For another example of girls being vicious to each other, check out Cat's Eye, by Margaret Atwood.	2003-10-24

The central issue is Rosie and her new life as an au-pair in Paris.  At first we learn of Rosie's circumstances, how she lost her mother so young, how her sister watched over her, how her sister could not conceive, and how Rosie had the idea to get pregnant so that her sister could become a mother.  So far, so good, although slightly contrived for my taste.  But when Rosie arrives to Paris, she has to deal with a dysfunctional family, with an emasculated husband, Marc, and a narcissistic wife, Nicole.  Rosie feels alienated, unimportant, lonely, and rather than exploring those feelings some more, we get rushed into a WWII post memory of Nicole's mother, and we learn about a teenager's homosexual awakening and confusion, and about religious vocations, plus vacations abroad, extra-marital affairs, Nicole's secret past, etc, etc.  The lack of detail in any given area of the book left me very unsatisfied.  The descriptions of all French and Spanish things I found redundant and narrow-minded, and gave me no perspective on those countries and their way of life.	2003-10-08

Abilene was only nine years old when she decided to make Austin a baseball star.  I won't pretend to be an expert in childhood (although I was nine once upon a time), but bipolar disorder and all, Abilene was awfully young to be so determined.  Think about it: a nine-year-old tomboy girl is showing her four-year old brother to throw baseballs.  Why is there no room for anything else, like climbing trees, skateboarding, bicycling?  How can a nine-year old have such tremendous focus on her own?  The book does not address the different levels of maturity that kids have considering that age difference, plus the innate gap that exists between male and female children.  I couldn't bring in any amount of willing suspension of disbelief to get over this.<br />I could have understood the story better if Abilene's compulsion to train Austin had happened after her experience with her high-school team (she gets rejected, and her brother gets to potentially vindicate her humiliation, plus she gets to live vicariously through him).  But the five-year difference is not enough to make Abilene behave like a pushy mother.<br />Austin has bratty moments, like any teenager.  However, the disdain he feels towards his parents is compounded by his desire to please Abilene, who truly despises them.  One of the most interesting moments in the book for me is when Austin comes to terms with who his parents are, and stops seeing them as pathetic individuals.  At that moment he steps into maturity (although he had already breached his way into it when he realized that Abilene was not invincible).<br />Something I liked is that the key dramatic moment in the story (the guns episode) did not go where I thought it was going.  I appreciate it when a writer keeps me on my toes.  Still, my shortcomings as a reader kept me from giving this novel a higher score.	2003-09-09

A man is on a bridge overlooking a river.  In his background, there are green hills, a church, farmhouses.  The image reflected on the water, though, shows skyscrapers and a gilded dome.  Such is Clifford's dilemma,  For those of us who have a love-hate relationship with our hometown, this book is a must.  The back cover of my copy speaks of restoration and renewal.  To me the novel had more to do with coming to terms with your past.  Cliff is in a sense overcome with nostalgia.  He is on the brink of obsession with the way things used to be.  He is soon to be 30, and is going through an early middle-age crisis.  Always solution-oriented, Cliff goes back home in hopes to find answers to his questions, and even considers relocating there (even though he knows that is impossible).  The novel narrates his adventures and misadventures during his time in Little Rock.  He rediscovers who his true friends are, and in the process makes a few enemies.  Most interesting is his relationship with Dall, his best buddy but a terrible racist.  Clifford \\"converts\\" him by example, without trying, and the process sounds totally believable, when it would have been very easy to make it look like a fairytale.  Cliff's relationship with Margaret, his high-school sweetheart and a very messed up woman, is also well explained.  I have always had a friend back home who cannot stop telling me how great it is to still live there.<br />Although there is a lot of humor (the scene in the pool house had me in stitches), this is ultimately a serious novel, that shows how nostalgia is a mistake.	2003-09-01

After all, I knew the end already.  This made it even harder to go through the passages where Gilda is full of hope, or when she receives good news about her remission.  It was very courageous of her to put her thoughts on paper, and I am sure so many people have benefited from reading about her experiences.  It always amazes me how people can be so candid about their \\"dirty laundry\\".  For example, her cancer had a negative impact on her marriage.  There were fights, some very ugly, and yet she is able to bare it all.  I am sure it was not with a voyeuristic sense, but to show what havoc cancer can run in your life, and how you are not alone in your feelings.  Ultimately this is what she found at The Wellness Community, and what she wished to give back.  Good for her.	2003-07-24

In this novel, Mara and Dann are living in Ifrik (Africa) many, many years in the future.  Some catastrophe has taken place on Planet Earth, and civilization as we know it had been obliterated.  Mara and Dann belong to the civilization that rose from the devastation.  They will travel from southern to northern Ifrik during some very entertaining 400 or so pages.<br />Two things I enjoyed: first, the map of Ifrik at the very beginning of the book.  It was a valuable reference.  Also, I liked the modified names that pepper the story.  Ifrik is Africa, Yerrup is Europe, and the best: the legends of unhappy women, like Mam Bova, Ankrena, Mam Bedfly!<br />What I didn't like were seven-year-old Mara asking questions that were totally out of her league, the figure of Kulik (why is he so bent in chasing them?), and the final arrival to the Promised Land.  There was something very anti-climactic there.<br />But, as a whole, this is an enjoyable novel, very engaging.	2003-07-24

It does put forth a serious moral dilemma, and portrays very well the common emotions that may surround such a situation.  The author was able to describe the little cliques that exist in any high-school-USA in exquisite detail.  Another valuable aspect was the relationship between mother and daughter, its moments of tension and deep understanding.  Another one was Michael's catharsis, from an opportunistic teenager to adulthood (wish the transition has been less painful), and how he learns to appreciate (and distinguish) true friendship.  My least favorite scene was the final one, which was too contrived for my taste.  Other than that, this book would make a young person think.  And i love the metaphorical title.	2003-07-24

It's almost silly to write a review of Their Eyes Were Watching God, because so many things have been said about it already.  I liked the book tremendously.  It is written in a powerful style, and you feel the pain and happiness that Janie goes through.  It was a bit difficult for me at the beginning to follow the dialect, but after a while it was no longer so.  This is a great novel, and I can see how Zora Neale Hurston's influence has touched a great deal of contemporary African American writers.	2003-07-24

As true as that is, another truth is that the vast majority of us keep quiet about the details of such swindling. This is why I found this book shocking at the beginning. The author hides very little, and for someone who had so many issues, it did not make sense. I interpreted maybe as a way to \\"atone\\" for what had happened, for her share of the blame. In the meantime, I was totally engrossed with the book. I read it over a weekend; the writing style is quite easy, and you can pretty much zoom along. I felt almost like a voyeur, peeking into the intimacies of this woman, learning about something so private and that I definitively would have concealed.<br />Then it dawned on me, all of a sudden. She said how important money is for her. Well, what a better way to recoup the $100K lost to her therapist than to write her unbelievable tale?!?! It all made sense.<br />One thing that really turned me off had to do with her comments about Mark Brazill, her co-writer.  He apparently had an anger management problem, and she was too scared of him.  This is the same woman who used to tell people to shut up in the middle of a theater.  Somehow it does not make sense.  Why does she choose to criticize some people with first and last names, and leave others anonymous?<br />This book is a perfect example of how reality can be stranger than fiction. If she had written this for TV or the movies, she would have been laughed at.<br />So, I recommend it. It is entertaining, fast, and slightly sordid.	2003-06-04

The writing is just as simplistic as the flow of the story.  The transitions are lean and need more explanation.  For example, at one point we have Peter totally enthralled with finding more about his reincarnation.  Then he is ready to toss the towel and go home.  The only link that connects both situations is a brief mention that he had been canvassing neighborhoods for six days, with no luck.

The author feels compelled to quote Homer, Shakespeare and Descartes on every other page (I am not exaggerating).  He also drops words like Einsatzgruppe, Volksgemeinschaft and Kristallnatch here and there, with no translation for the benefit of those of us that do not speak German.  In general, his prose is convoluted, the sentence structure is made more difficult than it should be, and in a choice of synonyms, the longer one always wins.  It is almost like the author looked up a word in the dictionary, and picked synonym #5.  If it hadn't been for that, this book would be 1/3 shorter.<br />I can only imagine that as an ESL speaker, the author does not fully get the pretentiousness that emanates from his prose.  Words like \\"manumission\\", \\"phantasmagoria\\", \\"buckram\\", \\"sublunary\\", make me think that the author is somehow showing off.  It may well be that he did learn English in the XIX Century, hence his arcane prose.<br />In any event, this book ended up being insufferable, and I'd rather read someone else's memoirs.	2003-05-26

I enjoyed the unusual \\"out of order\\" sequence of events. The story starts after the worst of the plague has passed. We find the rector a widower, and Anna very worried about his state of mind. He is grieving, and appears to have lost his faith. Then the story backtracks to a time when Anna has a content life with husband and boys. Then the plague appears, and finally the story catches up to the beginning, with Anna watching as Montpellior sinks deeper and deeper into his own pity. I thought that the sequence of events in that fashion made for a very entertaining story line.<br />I loved some of the language used: \\"one and twenty years old\\", \\"my feet are unlovely\\".  These are unusual constructions and words in today's English, and it was refreshing to hear them.<br />Another thing that I really appreciated (and that I wish more authors would do) are the author's notes at the end. Of course, after finishing the book, I had questions about the plague, about Puritanism and so forth. On the notes, Geraldine Brooks explains how she came to the true story of a village in England which decided to lock itself in as to avoid spread of the plague. She explains some things about the disease, and has a chance to talk about why she decided to have the characters do this or that in the book. That was very satisfying.<br />I have to admit to be rather surprised with the events that take place in the end. Yes, some of the imagery would be perfectly at home in a romance novel. So what? As lurid as some of those scenes are, they do not detract enough from the book as to make anyone toss it into the fireplace. Also, the motivations of Anna and Montpellior to behave a certain way are perfectly clear: no, they were not hypocrites. Montpellior was blinded by his own faith, and Anna decided to be Anna, not to try to emulate her soulmate Elinor. Fate or serendipity or whatever you want to call it placed her into a path that truly allowed her to become her own person.<br />I'd be hard pressed to say this was a beautiful book, but there were many beautiful moments in it. The friendship of Anna and Elinor is reason alone to read it.ome her own person. <br />I'd be hard pressed to say this was a beautiful book, but there were many beautiful moments in it.

Scattered here and there are proofs of Hiaasen's genius.  This is the first book i've read by him, and I am not terribly impressed.

After all, the author is an adult.  I can imagine how hard it must be not just to write well, but in a sense to \\"act\\", because you're not a child anymore.  This is why I so enjoyed Some Things That Stay.  The narrator, Tamara, is a very smart and mature 15 year-old, but she is truly her age.<br />I have a weakness for coming of age stories, and this one will remain in my memory for a long time.  Tamara is the daughter of an itinerant family.  She is longing to put roots down, but this doesn't seem to happen.  One issue that the book addresses so well is the difference in perception that parents and children sometimes have.  For the parents, it is such an adventure to go live all over the country, when in fact Tamara is outraged.  After a discussion on sex (quite a big deal in the 50's, I suppose), with pictures included (after all, the father is a painter), Tamara says: \\"They imagine themselves great teachers.  They swell with pride at their openness, their boldness, their ability to get out the facts.  But they started with us much too early, and now, when a frank talk about sex might actually interest me, they have collapsed into themselves, like those distant galaxies, the hot air and gas all burned up.\\"<br />The novel covers one year in the life of Tamara's family, a year that will change everything and everybody.  Sometimes the prose can be a little corny (in a letter from the father to the mother: \\"She needs you.  You are her reds and yellows and greens, her indigo, emerald, and ultramarine.  I am only black\\"), but overall this is a very satisfying book, a story that rings true in so many instances.  For example, Tamara despises her father at times (she once called him \\"Cosmic Cretin\\"; another time she said: \\"Maybe [God's] a little bit like my dad too: blinded by His own light\\"), yet she loves him so deeply.  A contradiction so strong and so real takes some skill to portray, and the author does that beautifully.

The premise, excellent: we die for real when we are forgotten.  The novel starts in a very promising way.  A recent widower cannot seem to enjoy life anymore.  His wife's mother is going through similar grief.  While it would have been fascinating to see how these two people struggled through their pain, the author sticks a \\"play\\" in the middle of the novel to explore her theory of how oblivion equals true death.  The space dedicated to that pseudo-play would have been better utilized showing how the two main characters recover (or not) from their grief and how Hart's theory proves to be valid (or not).<br />I still think Josephine Hart is an excellent writer, and recommend Sin as proof.

She leaves their NY home and drives all the way to her family's estate in Tennessee.  When she arrives, her grandmother and aunts do not dare ask what has happened, even though everybody wonders where is her husband.  What an excellent piece of commentary about Anglo culture: any hot-blooded, Mediterranean type would have pummeled her with questions in seconds.  What an excellent opening act!  The readers will soon realize that the reason nobody asks questions is so that they do not have to answer any in exchange.  From Grandma to Aunt Willy to Cousin Daphne to Cousin Elsie, the entire array of women, whether they are sitting on the porch or not, have searched for love in all the wrong places.  The men have not fared any better, and are even more unable to do so that the women themselves.<br />Almost in a vignette format, we learn about the sad interior lives of all characters.  There is an overall feeling of despair that permeates each and every person in the book.  There are no happy stories, and what is worse, no sense of hope either.<br />Caroline Gordon wrote this novel in 1944, which accounts for the fact that the language and tone are quite dated.  This was a turbulent time in the US, not just because of the war, but also because of the societal changes that were brewing.  Some of the topics addressed by this book are black-white relations, sex outside of marriage, divorce and homosexuality.  I imagine that this book caused quite a turmoil, when it was first published.	2002-11-30

It wasn't written in Arameic	I am amazed at the large number of people who cannot tell fiction from non-fiction, and then hold the author accountable for the deceit they have suffered.  Maybe this is why some writers title their books \\"xxxxxx, A NOVEL\\", so that no one gets confused.  Paulo Coelho should have been advised to tackle on the words \\"a novel\\" after The Fifth Mountain, so that people did not think he was writing Elijah's biography.<br />Leaving aside the fact that this is a work of fiction, I think the book portrays very well how life must have been in the Middle East so many centuries ago.

I would have given the book more stars if Ms. Chute had refrained from telling me how wrong I was in my reading of the novel.  My consolation is that I was not alone in my mistakes.

Scottie, who belongs to group #1, is the narrator.  This fight takes place within Scottie&#146;s family and also in his outer circle.  Scottie eventually sees the light, drops off his &#147;evil&#148; ways, and does the right things by crossing over to the other side.  We know this because in Part 3 his daughter gives us a sort of epilogue.<br />OK, I saw that coming very early on.  Scottie is beat up from the beginning.  He is surrounded by women with a deep connection to Mother Nature.  It was clear that this novel was going to deal with the metamorphosis of Scottie, from callous individual to gentle soul.<br />The obviousness of this shift really disappointed me.  There was no mystery to the book afterwards.<br />The writing was contrived, and some situations quite forced.  Early on, Scottie tells us that his political opponent knows of his phobia for muddy footprints on clean carpet, and purposely will dirty his office.  Apart from the irrelevance of this fact, doesn&#146;t everybody dislike mud on a clean carpet?  The love scenes between Scottie and his wife were also quite gratuitous.  What did they really contributed to the story?  Scottie has already told us how much he loves his wife and what a great family life he has.<br />I was expecting more from Chris Bohjalian and this book.  After reading it, I have to conclude he only knows how to write one type of novel, and that is sad.  The parallels between this novel and Midwives are plentiful.  A dad, mom and precocious daughter.  Two bands, opposed to the end.  Goodness prevails.  The daughter writes an epilogue at the end.  There is a big difference, though: Water Witches is far more self-righteous.	2002-11-03

I lose count.<br />Well, John Irving answered my prayers, and in one short book replied to all of my questions and to a few more I didn't even know I had.<br />I am a huge fan of Irving.  He writes like nobody can; he also takes himself very unseriously.  I have enjoyed all of his books immensely.  This one was a joy from beginning to end.  For starters, it gives a fascinating insight into The Cider House Rules.  He explains his characters, goes through the thought process that made him write the book this or that way.<br />This memoir explains very well why it is almost always impossible to transform a book into a movie script verbatim.  Irving goes through the painful steps that he took to make The Cider House Rules into a successful movie.  It was wonderful to read about the back and forth that Irving had with the director of the film, Lasse Hallstrom.  It makes me think that making a movie based on a book is more than anything a labor of negotiation.  For me, one of the most poignant moments of this memoir is when Irving tells why he chose the role of the stationmaster.  \\"I just wanted to be there, in the stationmaster's wretched persona, to see Homer get off that train.\\"  As an author, this was probably a brilliant moment in his life, seeing his characters in the flesh.<br />Irving not only reminisces about the trials and tribulations he had to endure to see this book into a movie.  He also writes about writing some of his other novels, and bringing them to film, and as always, about his sons.

Even though it is obvious and clear on the jacket, I picked up this book without the notion that it was going to be a murder mystery.  I was more convinced that it was going to be a plain vanilla novel.<br />This is good, because I am not much of a mystery reader.  For my taste, the willing suspension of disbelief that most mysteries require is too much to stomach, and I get disappointed way before the end.<br />Atticus is terrific.  Not only it is a beautiful story about a father and his prodigal son. It is also an engaging murder mystery with an amazing plot.  I was truly surprised at the  resolution of the story.  There was very little in the plot to suggest that this was how everything would end.<br />The writing was sincere and powerful.  Such beautiful similes: \\"Awkward as a box full of shoes\\".  What an evident and mundane thing to say, and how exquisite.  \\"... the water was as tepid and clear as Perrier but from a distance had the turquoise color of kitchens in the fifties\\".  The description of the wild Mexican landscape, the people of Resurrecci&oacute;n, all done to perfection.  This was a tactile novel, where you could see and smell and feel what the characters were experiencing.<br />The love that Atticus feels for his son Scott, no matter how messed up, rotten and selfish Scott has been, is so sincere and pure and beyond all reproach that it brought tears to my eyes in more than one occasion.  This is one of the best books I have read this year.  Do not let this one go by.	2002-09-30
US	52987300	R10M352PO0KATL	0684835355	64834095	Cloud Chamber: A Novel	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Slightly disappointing must-read companion to AYRIBW	It is very difficult to speak in different voices.  After all, you are but one person.  Some writers can do it, and do it brilliantly (like Barbara Kingsolver in The Poisonwood Bible).  Michael Dorris did not manage to clearly separate the voices of all of his characters.  Maybe it is because there were so many.  There are two clear camps in this book:  the strong-willed woman and the patsy man.  It would be conceivable that all the women had a similar voice, and that all the men had a similar voice.  However, I found that the tone was very similar for all characters, men and women alike.<br />The story, as a whole, is very entertaining, and definitively a complement of A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (which by the way is better written, in my opinion).<br />A few more comments:<br />Why didn't Marcella and Edna ever figure out that their mother had been in love with their uncle?  After all, there were plenty of clues.<br />I was confused with the age of the girls.  On page 117, Edna says, \\"Years ago, before Papa got sick, I had visited the Ursuline convent in Samaria, Kentucky, on a seventh-grade outing...\\"  That would make her 12 years old.  Then, on page 118, she continues: \\"The summer of 1930, the seventh year after Papa died, I was nineteen and Marcella was two years younger\\".  That would also make her 12 years old when her father died (19 - 7 = 12).  But there is a contradiction, because she cannot be 12 \\" before Papa got sick...\\" and 12 when her father died.  Why didn't an editor pick up on this?<br />I also did not like Marcella's conversation with her son in pages 203 and up.  She confesses to living her life as a whole act.  The Marcella they all see, that's not who she really is.  She only plays the part of the ditty, happy-go-lucky sister.  This is unbelievable.  This is something that you would expect to see in a spy movie, where someone lives undercover among regular people who have no idea.  But not a dear lady in Kentucky, come on.	2002-09-23

My biggest criticism is that the flow is not quite right.  I attribute that to the fact that the author is not a writer by trade.  The very extensive details that pepper the story detract to the overall flow of it, but nonetheless, this book is very interesting.  Monica Sone explores the dichotomy that many \\"hybrid\\" people experience: the contradictions of culture, the generational gap made even deeper because of the cultural differences.  In her case, these differences were quite extreme: from the demurred and modest Japanese ways to the boisterous, assertive American.  She describes many examples of where these differences were patent, and does a very god job in the process.  Another excellent area of the book is her analysis of the conflicting emotions she experienced.  Here she is, feeling very American, and sent to a concentration camp, labeled as \\"the enemy\\".  She and her fellow camp-mates experience a collective rage, but it is during these years and after her release that she finally comes to terms with her at times contradictory cultural heritage.  The end has very patriotic overtones which I thought were quite sappy, given her circumstances.  I wish she could have gone further into describing her family life after camp, and the reassimilation of Japanese into American society post WWII.	2002-09-03

I first heard of Andrew Tobias from his website, where he dissects and explains all mutual funds expenses.  Not all no-load funds are created equal, and I realized that thanks to him.  This book is great to get a sense of who Andrew Tobias is, what his core investing philosophy is, and be entertained in the meantime (he has lived a fascinating life).  I can see where those readers who know a couple of things about personal finance might be a bit frustrated with the book, which is more than anything an autobiography.  It was certainly worth my while to read it, and I recommend it.	2002-07-31

She witnesses tragedy and pain, and superstitiously believes that if she tries really hard to fix all that, her son would be spared.  She becomes so immersed in this belief that eventually her marriage falls apart and her family fragments.  This book is successful in explaining how highly intelligent and educated people can make horrible decisions based on nothingness.  I think Perri Klass does a very good job portraying the love that a mother feels for her child.  In many instances the main character is caught relishing on her beautiful son, and her love is expressed in many sweet ways.  The plot is interesting, not a page-turner, but this is nonetheless a good book to take along in a long flight, or to read by the pool.	2002-07-30

She can be so detailed in her descriptions and focus on minute items and spend pages and pages on them.  I happen to love the way she writes, but understand that  many people do not have the patience to deal with this.<br />I can see how diehard fans of JCO resent her for writing this novel.  I can also see how this book was chosen to be an Oprah selection.  I got through its 454 pages at times loving it and at times hoping for a near end.  Here's the positives:<br />The demise of the family has a very karmic feel to it.  Corinne comes through as a very haughty woman despite her Christian beliefs.  Michael Sr. places a very high value on status, and wants to be accepted by those he perceives as \\"worthy\\".  If Corinne had been a little bit more like Michael and viceversa, the family would have survived (and then we would have no book!).<br />There is a big element of surprise throughout the story.  When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, it does.<br />Character development is perfect, to the point that you get to intimately know everybody in the book.  The parents and the children all have important roles, except for Michael Jr., the least relevant.<br />Horror is a difficult genre.  For horror to be truly successful, it must be unexpected.  The banishment of Marianne by her loving and adoring parents after her rape is one of the most horrific moments in JCO's works.  What exquisite cruelty!  Michael Sr., himself banished from his family and deeply hurt by it, inflicts the same pain on his own fresh and blood.<br />Here's the negatives:<br />The book started great, but lost momentum at the end.  I was particularly disappointed with the last scene, the 4th of July reunion.  JCO is far more sinister than that, but maybe she is tired of writing high-caliber literature that does not have a huge following, and decided to show everybody that she too can write an Oprah bestseller.  Good for her.<br />I have a hard time accepting poor grammar and punctuation, even when it is used for the sake of reality.  In this case it doesn't fly.  Judd is the narrator, and he is a newspaper editor.  It is not inconceivable to expect perfect punctuation from him, yet at times commas shine in their absence.<br />All in all, a keeper.ccepting poor grammar and punctuation, even when it is used for the sake of reality.

There are so many facets to this book that it is difficult to single them out.  Both Mai, the teenage daughter, and Thanh, her mother, are the narrators.  They left Saigon at the very last possible minute, and came to the US.  Mai has adapted quite well to this country, but has a very hard time carrying the responsibility of being the umbilical cord between her mother and this new and strange world.  As she grows older, she resents her mom's stagnation.  Mai describes perfectly the very precise moment when their connection broke: they were watching TV, it is fall in Virginia, the apartment is chilly, and Thanh is still dressed like if she were in Vietnam.  Her unwillingness or inability to adapt and move forth scares Mai, who as most young people has fears of her own and does not need to borrow them from anyone else, much less her mother.  At the same time, Mai is torn by guilt.  She is caught between her obligation to her mother and her survival instinct.  Mai is a mature and smart young woman, and can see what is slowly happening between them.  To make matters worse, Thanh suffers a stroke.  While she is in the hospital, Mai discovers her diary, and learns some family secrets she had no way of knowing.  One of the most interesting realizations for me was the fact that Mai's father was a very progressive thinker, except when it came to the role of her wife. Thanh wrote about this with bitterness, and I would have enjoyed finding out what Mai thought about that.  I like the dichotomy that appears in the novel once there are two narrators. Thanh is far more articulate than you would think based on Mai's descriptions, and equally smart.  She is certainly not as brave, hence the surprising ending.<br />There are some interesting secondary plots, like the fate of Mai's grandfather (the big mystery of the novel), Mrs. Bay and the local Vietnamese community, and Uncle Michael.  My biggest disappointment has to do with Mai and Michael when they met for the first time.  He is a wounded soldier in the hospital, and Mai, who by then is only a little girl, has to listen to his account of the hazing ceremony he went through (didn't he have the sense not to explain certain crude things to such a little girl?).<br />This is certainly worth checking out.

However, Alice Hoffman didn't do a bad job portraying why some girls gravitate towards gangs.  The sense of belonging and importance that they obtained when they officially became The Property was something that they probably had not experienced ever before.  The nameless protagonist, who is also the narrator, is a very mature 17 year old who is simply looking to connect with someone.  The object of her affection is McKay, the leader of the gang.  McKay is the epitome of the bad boy, and we all know how attractive a bad boy can be to a teenager. McKay is mysterious, powerful, and a junkie.  Sure, this book contains some graphic violence, drugs, sex, the works.  This is what the novel is about.  Don't expect to find a fairy tale, please!<br />The silver lining in this novel is that the protagonist eventually comes of age.  The process is very painful, but I loved the hopeful ending.<br />This book is in my honest opinion much better than Here on Earth.	2002-04-10

When I started to read it, I found it a bit boring, and thought some of Lisa's narrations were heavy-handed and with a slight touch of drama.  The time in England and Italy, where she lived in a sort of fantasy land with her husband and friends, and the first couple of years in the hacienda seemed especially so.  One example of that is when her husband's cousin tells her that she needs to push her authority in order to get results, and pretty much blackmails her into doing so.  Another example is her furtive trip into Los Pollos de Eladio.  Both scenes, as described in the book, look staged, almost out of a soap-opera.  She also used a very self-deprecating tone when describing herself in those early days, and in the distance that time brings, I wonder why she has not been able to forgive herself somehow.  After all, she was so young, how could she know what she was doing?<br />Midway through, the book started to take shape and develop into a very focused memoir.  I think the break point was the episode with the green boy.  After that, the flow changed and I found myself flipping pages anxiously, rushing to learn more and more.  I was very taken by the letters to her mother interspersed here and there.  They give the whole book a human and tender touch.  I was less impressed by her poems, though.  Some of her Spanish might have rusted out, or her translations lost some accuracy, like La Noche Buena (it is not Christmas, it is Christmas' Eve).  But much of Lisa's writing is brilliant, like the story of the dying eaglet.  That was beautiful, skilled writing, awesome.  I also liked her very subtle references to physical abuse in hands of her husband.  She describes these beatings in a way that could be described as elegant, which makes them even more horrific.  I very much enjoyed the farming bits, the sheep, the avocado and sugar cane stories.  I also enjoyed her transformation from a starry-eyed teenager into a woman assuming full responsibility for everybody and everything: her family, her farm, and the welfare of hundreds of people in it.  I wouldn't go as far as describing her as a \\"powerful matriarch\\", like the book jacket does, but she certainly obtained a power that was more than anything emanating from herself.<br />I was tremendously disappointed with the ending, though.  Throughout the book there are many references to her seven years in the hacienda, so you know that at some point she leaves.  The end was cliff-like: there is some elaboration to the circumstances that pushed her departure, and some of the obstacles she was facing.  And then, that's it.  She left.  I was hoping for an epilogue, a mention of what happened to her, her daughter, her husband, la gente, no matter how brief.  I was left yearning to know more, to wrap it up, because just by physically removing yourself from a place, you just don't automatically close that chapter of your life.<br />In any case, this book is very much worth your while.

This is what both Luards (Elisabeth and Nicholas) did, and managed to live in Spain, France and the English countryside with their children for much of their youth.  I have to admit it took me a while to get into the book.  Maybe it is the style, slightly purplish.  Once the family moved to Spain, though, I read with more interest.  When foreigners write about my country or my region, one of two things may happen: they got it or they didn't.  I am happy to report that Elisabeth belongs to the former camp.  For one thing, her portrayal of life in a small village in Andalucia in the 70's was excellent and veracious.  The episode with the donkey had me laughing.  One thing that annoys me, however, is how many Spanish words were misspelled.  It's not mesa camella, it's mesa camilla, it's not spontaneo (italian?), it's espont&aacute;neo!  I have encountered this with other English-speaking authors writing about a Spanish-speaking country.  Is a Spanish editor so hard to find?<br />Elisabeth discovered her love for food along the way, and the book is peppered with recipes in every chapter.  There are times when the recipe fits in very well, like for example when she is describing a specific dish or mentioning how each of her children demanded a different birthday cake.  Then, there are times when the recipe's appearance is somewhat contrived (for example, lentil soup: \\"It was time for strengthening lentil soup all around\\").  The recipes are, for the most part, very easy to follow, and although I haven't tried any yet, they do look good.<br />Nowhere is Elisabeth's writing style more esoteric than when it gets to the chapter about her daughter's death.  It was hard at times to follow what she was meaning, and it took a bit of reading and re-reading to figure it out.<br />This is an interesting book for those of us who come from the South of Spain or the South of France, or the Hebrides, or who enjoy reading about food.y reading about food.	2002-02-19

Too much reality for my weak stomach. I came to Amazon's website and read some of the critiques, all very positive. Then I wondered if I should give the book a second chance. I picked it up and got a second dose of reality, this time having to do with tampon insertion. Argh! This time I planned to take the book along with other castoffs to the thrift store. Before that happened, though, and because life is full of serendipity, I stumbled upon a commentary on this novel. The critic was very compelling in his praise, so I gave in and picked up the book for the third time (besides, I hate not to finish what I start).<br />It seems that after those very eschatological moments, Siri Hustvedt got it all out of her and continued in a pretty clean route towards the development of her novel. I have to admit that I liked it a little bit. I think she does a very good job portraying the state of mind of a young woman who is smart but aware of her educational shortcomings. The relationship between Lily and her old neighbor Mabel is crafted in a very smart way, because little by little, and way before the end, the reader can see the interdependence that these two women develop. I was very satisfied with the ending, which was a relief after so much of the novel was spent in a dark path of anguish. I was not so interested in the \\"mystery\\" that went along most of the book, but rather Lily's thoughts and ultimately, her `enchantment'. After all, I was happy I finished the book, and you should too.	2002-02-09

What a shame she died so young!  I have read a few of her other novels, but nowhere is this skill better shown than in this work.  In this story, a young woman (Olly) becomes a widow after her husband (the `bright and dangerous' of the title) dies in a boating accident.  She and her brother in law grieve together, and almost as a consequence they fall in love.  This story, explain so succinctly, sounds like it came from a pulp romance.  In fact, it is slightly corny in its premise.  However, Laurie Colwin depicts the pain, the anguish, the disbelief, and the whole array of emotions that the main characters go through.  She does it in such a detailed, intimate way, that I would recommend this book to anyone that is going through a grieving process.<br />But! I could not give it five start because of Part III.  Part I deals mostly with the blow, the sadness and the moving on, and Part II with Olly's new life as a widow in NYC.  But Part III focuses on her trip to music camp, and what develops there.  Without giving too much of the story away, I do not understand how Olly, now happily in love, could justify her behavior.  It is all explained in there, I have to admit that.  But my shortcomings as a reader get in the way, and I was disappointed about the ending.  In any case, this is a great book, and a prime example of the exquisite skill that Laurie Colwin left us with.	2001-12-27

I finished this book disliking it ever so slightly.  It would have made an awesome college report, but once you decide to publish it for the general public, the standard changes and the bar is raised.  For one thing, I could have done without all the \\"kind of\\" and \\"gotta\\".  This book, so academic, should have been proofread with that in mind.  The casual use of colloquialisms and slang was out of place and detracted value.<br />Although I share many of her thoughts, I was irritated by some of the liberties she took when presenting them.  For one thing, Wendy likes to generalize.  She writes about a 19-year old who decided to get married.  Wendy praises her decision, and makes a comment on the \\"words of tragedy\\" that the young bride had to hear.  I too would issue words of tragedy to the vast majority of 19-year old GIRLS thinking about getting married!  Statistics tell us that the younger you are when you marry, the higher your chances for divorce.  Although the specific case that Wendy mentions might have been different, why does she turn up her nose to the \\"words of tragedy\\"?  It is a poor idea to get married so young, because your chances for success are stacked against you.  This is a substantiated fact.  If Wendy had been truly rigorous in her analysis, she should have refrained from criticizing those who objected to such a young marriage, therefore generalizing marrying at 19 as a \\"swell\\" idea.<br />One area that I found particularly offensive is her opinion on antidepressants.  Depression is a legitimate mental ailment, that in many cases has a clinical origin.  For decades men and women alike have been blown off by their doctors whenever they have complained about feeling \\"blue\\".  \\"Oh, you just need to get out some more.  Take a vacation, go shopping!  You'll see how you'll snap out of it soon!\\".  What can you do if you have a biochemical imbalance in your brain?  What would happen if doctors treated pancreatitis with the same cavalier attitude?  Once again, Wendy falls prey of generalization, an easy resource for green writers.  There might be some physicians out there that prescribe Prozac in the way Wendy describes, but this is no ground to make a sweeping generalization on the use of antidepressant medication.<br />The episode when her friend goes to the doctor to get a prescription for the pill is sad.  Wendy paints the doctor as devoid of any sensitivity, when the only thing the woman was trying to do was her job.  I found it downright pathetic the squeamishness that her friend experienced once at the doctor's office, but I find a million times more objectionable the account that Wendy makes of the episode.<br />Her quotes on Marx are quite ridiculous, which are not improved by her writing.  It is almost as if she had reached a circular reference (see page 146).<br />She is right on when commenting on the loss of manners in our society.  I notice an omnipresent lack of respect in our daily life, to the point that someone having a courteous gesture towards you is more of a surprise than the norm.  But I fail to see the correlation between lack of modesty and lack of courtesy.  Bad manners are an equal opportunity defect, affecting men and women alike.<br />No matter what, I agree with Wendy Shalit's thesis.  As a society, we are oversexed.  Women have gotten the short end of the stick after the sexual revolution of the 60's.  It is indignant that fourth graders have to learn about masturbation and orgasms.  And I am too an essentialist!  I only wish Wendy had communicated her message better.doctors treated pancreatitis with the same cavalier attitude?

The chapter structure (Fiction, Non-fiction, Poetry, Resolution, Setting, Tone, etc.) is also quite attractive, if nothing else because of its novelty.  Some chapters are rather beautiful, like The Teacher.  Julia does a very good job exploring the pain that the teacher feels after the death of his lover.  She is also quite good at describing the hypocrisy and double-standards that exist in Latino culture, where the women must be pure and virginal while the men will be boys...  She was right on regarding this topic.  Unfortunately, other chapters border on the contrived, like The Student.  I know he was a football player, but to root for Mailer or Updike like they were going for a touchdown is a little far fetched, no matter how well they write.  Also, to assume that people in Spain will think of you as a savage if you are from the Dominican Republic is an offensive stretch.  There is a sense of hit and miss in her writing that left me a little unfulfilled.	2001-11-30

This has got to be without a doubt the worst novel I have ever read.  There are no redeeming qualities here.  The story line is ridiculous.  The coincidences are too much to bear.  Debby, who is adopted by an Italian couple as a toddler, never develops much love for them, even though they are decent, loving people.  She saves her love and sick fascination for her birth parents, a Fresno woman who went to India in the 60's looking for a guru, and the guru himself, a serial killer currently in prison.  She wants to meet them and then do some sort of damage to them, as payback (for what?  She was better off growing up in Schenedctady).  Debby graduates from college and manages to become the lover of a filthy rich ex-Jackie Chan of sorts.  He doesn't give her the respect she \\"deserves\\" so she torches his apartment.  Then she escapes to California, in search for bio-parents.  While in the Haight-Ashbury, she manages to charm a film producer who happens to know her bio-mom.  Debby is the luckiest person on earth!!!  There are 30 million souls in CA and she happens to bang the guy who is banging her mom.  Debby (now named Devi) will not know this until later in the story, when the private eye she has hired reveals the whole mystery, and soon disappears, and at this point I had had enough of this poor excuse for a novel and threw it across the room.  The only thing that really piqued my interest is the reference to Ashrams in blue collar Napa.  Wow.  Other than that, this was a waste of pulp.	2001-11-30

Este ha sido el caso con esta novela, que me ha gustado much&iacute;simo.  Una de las cosas que m&aacute;s me ha asombrado es que si hago bien la cuenta, Carmen Mart&iacute;n Gaite ten&iacute;a apenas 22 a&ntilde;itos cuando escribi&oacute; este libro.

Un ejemplo es cuando &Aacute;ngel presenta a Gertru en la fiesta, y la lleva cogida del cogote (&iquest;y por qu&eacute; ya de paso no le pone una brida?).  Otra escena de &Aacute;ngel y Gertru es cuando ella le dice que quiere terminar el bachillerato, y &eacute;l le contesta que para casarse con &eacute;l no le hace falta ni geometr&iacute;a ni leches.  El macho espa&ntilde;ol, en todo su apogeo.<br />M&aacute;s escenas de miedo: la mojigater&iacute;a  de T&iacute;a Concha, oponi&eacute;ndose a que sus sobrinas vayan a una fiesta \\"como cabras locas\\".

US	52987300	RLNSCYNGFMW9H	0231068883	415336315	Behind the Curtains	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Marvelous and sad novel	When I read a novel so beautiful, I have a hard time writing a critique, maybe because I won't do it justic.  One of the things that has amazed me the most is that, if I calculate it correctly, Carmen Mart&iacute;n Gaite was only 22 when she wrote the book.  When I was 22 I was in limbo land.  Her observation skills are incredible.<br />I am not sure that the story would sound flippant to some readers.  Spain was like this in the post war years.  Some scenes are so full of truth that they are scary.  An example is when &Aacute;ngel takes Gertru to a party, and he is holding her by the neck (why not put a bridle on while he's at it?).  Another scene is when Gertru tells &Aacute;ngel she would like to finish high school, and he replies that to marry him she does not need geometry or anything else.  The Spanish macho, in all his splendor.<br />More scary scenes: the repressive aunt, fighting with her nieces who want to go to a party, \\"like crazy goats\\".  The dialog between Concha and Mercedes is precious.  I am sure lots of people would be surprised to read about women almost in their thirties having to put up with such humiliations, but unfortunately CMG was writing about reality, pure and simple.  This novel helps you understand what was happening at the time and the repercussions in years to come.  The Gertrus and Julias made sure their daughters had an education, so that they did not have to put up with stupidity from anyone, so that they did not have to go from the parents' dictatorship to the husband's dictatorship, so that they were free to do whatever they wanted.  In the distance it sounds weird, but it is the Spanish postwar reality.<br />One of the things that disappointed me a bit was that there are some characters underutilized, like Goyita and Manolo Torre.  It is strange, because Goyita appears in one of the first scenes, but later on she barely shows.  Natalia is who starts the book, and although she is in the background for a good part of the action, at the end she appears and carries a good chunk of the story.  When CMG wrote this book, she probably did not have an editor checking every comma and every period.  In any case, I still marvel at the deep perception and accurate dialogs in this brilliant novel.e appears and carries a good chunk of the story.

Well, I lived in Fresno for a while, so I decided to read this little book of short stories.  Saroyan is not exactly a pleasant writer.  There's a certain anger in his writing that flares up here and there.  Besides, some of these stories are rather simplistic in their development, almost too contrived, like the first one, The man with the heart in the Highlands.  The repetitious pattern of sentences made this story read like a college assignment.  However,  I enjoyed \\"Many miles per hour\\", a story about two brothers who befriend (and end up adoring) a race car driver.  This story alone is worth getting the book.  The youngest brother is the narrator, a little guy only 10 years old, and he does such a  good job.  My other two favorite stories are \\"Madness in the family\\" is possibly an autobiographical tale of eccentric relatives, and \\"A Fresno tale\\", so funny because it is extremely short and missing an ending.	2001-10-31

This book is a piece of academic research, and at times it is hard to follow if you do not have the scientific background necessary.  However, there are sections in this book more entertaining that network TV.  When you read about the disagreements, battles, breakups, infidelities and romances that take place in a community of Greylag geese, you'd think you are reading a script for a new daytime soap opera.  Konrad Lorenz could have easily moonlighted as a Hollywood writer.  In addition to the hilarious antics of the geese, I finished the book with certainly more knowledge than before,  and with a sense of admiration for these animals and the humans who painstakingly observed them.	2001-10-31

For example, being in an S&amp;M relationship.  The subject matter in this novel is disgusting and at times horrifying, but the book is very well written.  The woman is the narrator, and she tells the story of her relationship years after the fact.  She speaks in a very detached way, yet the woman's deep love and devotion for her master are very obvious, despite how sickly she was manipulated.<br />There are certain types of violence that can be very elegant, and i'm not sure that elegant is the word I need here, but this is the case with this novel. It was also scary to see the arrogance and complete thirst for domination that her master had, because it went beyond sex.  The robberies she was compelled to commit are proof of that.  It is easy to pass judgment on the woman for falling for such a treatment, but the book tells the story extremely well and certainly worth a read.	2001-10-31

On the other hand, this book would have greatly improved if an editor had removed the extra weight included in the story.  I can see this being a very fascinating memoir for her family members, but once you take this to the general public, the array of names and places and the personal messages to all grandchildren at the end of the book become too much.  Nonetheless, it was interesting to read about the trials and tribulations of this woman, married at 20 to an alcoholic.  Why she continued having children (eight in total) after she discovered her husband was a drunk i'd never be able to comprehend.  She tries to explain how she felt during those years, and at times she is successful and at times she cuts her thoughts short and does not go any further with her analyses.  It's a pity because she does have some engaging, albeit sometimes bland, perspective on issues like alcohol, politics, the military, war, family, sex, etc.  Don't expect big depths on this book, which by the way is a very easy and fast read.	2001-10-29

After reading The Ballad of Gussie and Clyde and Home Again, Home Again, i am of the opinion that journalists make poor book writers.  It's one thing to write a 1000-word article, but once the assignment (in this case, the book) grows in size, the quality suffers.  Or maybe it has to do with the fact that these two books are memoirs, semi-autobiographical, about family members, in summary too close to the heart.<br />I picked up this book with a certain degree of excitement, which grew after i saw the photos.  This looked like a very interesting story, life in the Midwest in the early 50's and 60's, the adventures and misfortunes of a normal American family.  This is one of my favorite topics, the lives of ordinary people doing ordinary things.  Books like this almost feel like manuals for life, a sort of &quot;How-To-Live&quot; guide.  But i only had to read a few pages to realize this book was not going to deliver.  What stood up right away is that the writing style is quite flat and basic.  There is no panache, nothing fancy in the simplistic writing, which detracted from the story.  Another thing is that the core of the book, the father-son conflict, is drawn in very vague strokes.  What would have made the narrative more forceful is if there had been solid examples of such conflict.  I was left with an unfulfilled need to understand how and why things happened.  I read about a blowup in the car on the way to school and the occasional spanking because the kids were making too much noise, but that's as specific as it got.  What were these incidents so special?  After all, we've all experienced them.  Why didn't we have a father like the one in the book?  What made him stand apart?  I guess what i am asking is, why isn't this story written more like a novel?  Where's the development, the resolution?  Both issues combined, the lack of flair in the writing style and the lack of facts in the story disappointed me.f flair in the writing style and the lack of facts in the story disappointed me.	2001-10-17

How else could you explain a 15-year old getting knocked up?  Here is where the troubles for Bone begin.  Bone is the bastard of the title, who has to endure not just horrible abuse from the part of her vicious stepfather, but also betrayal from her mother.  There are many scary parts in the book.  One of them is that this is very much an autobiography.  Also, even scarier than the fights or the beatings or the sexual abuse is the darkness that such a young girl can experience.  After reading this book, i can understand very clearly how psychopaths are created.  If Bone (Dorothy) had been a weaker person, she would have ended up a vicious murderer.  She explains, step by step, how someone can destroy your very soul, and this really got to me.<br />There are so many of us who insist on living in fantasyland.  We want to have a life as perfect as possible, whatever the cost, without realizing that this is impossible most of the time.  Bone's mother, Anney, simply wants a beautiful family life for her little girls and the husband she loves so much.  In order for this to happen, she puts the burden of responsibility on Bone, a girl who at the end of the story is not even 13 years old.  She must be good, she cannot make daddy mad, she needs to be quiet...  How cruel can you be?  How blind must you be, how weak?  Anney uses the word 'love' in every other statement, yet she betrays her own flesh and blood for a man who makes her daughter bleed in body and soul.  She was, in my opinion, the real monster of the story.<br />I am sure Dorothy Allison writes from the truth, and can believe that the characters are not stereotypes, but real people.  I can even forgive the ones that look a bit over the top, like Daddy Glen.  He is difficult to understand, but i cannot pretend to understand everybody in this context.  Great book, but beware: very dark and disturbing.	2001-10-10

We complain about not having enough time to do the things we like to do, for example, reading.  Luckily, books like this one are published!  You see, this book is just like reading Wuthering Heights, The Horse Whisperer, Cinderella, Lassie and The Woman Who Walked Into Doors.  Imagine!  You can kill five birds with one stone!<br />Well, don't take me too seriously: this book does not do justice to any of the ones mentioned (not even Lassie).  Here are my reasons:<br />The first thing that annoyed me about this book is the fantasy license that it takes.  For example, a horse cannot singe lilac bushes, no matter how fast it's running.  Moreover, the lilacs will not smell sulfury after a horse, regardless of how evil and wild it is, runs down the street.  More fantasy: How about tears so hot that scald your face leaving little pinprick scars on your cheeks?  How about fainting during sex?  Can your (long) hair turn white in two months?  I know that happened to Marie Antoinette when she was waiting for her execution, but her circumstances were a little different from March's.  After all, March only needed to get a ride to the store to buy some hair dye.<br />The second thing that annoyed me was that the storyline is unplausible: teenage girl falls in love with teenage boy and viceversa, and cannot get over each other no matter how many years go by.  Come on!  How many times during high school did you cry yourself to sleep over some guy whose name you can hardly remember today?  There is also  something wrong with generous Henry Murray, because he does not change his will or makes provisions after taking in a foster kid.  This is why the evil step-brother takes advantage,  like in Cinderella, only Hollis is no princess with a heart of gold.  This is too much melodrama for my taste.<br />Something else that is too unrealistic (unless you are a Kennedy) is that there are too many dead people in the book: March's mom and dad, Alan's wife, Hollis' wife and son, Richard's parents, Judith Dale.  Most of them died in tragic circumstances or were too young.  I also cannot believe that Gwen went from being a spoiled teenager devoid of any inspiration to becoming a self-assertive person after simply seeing a horse in a pasture.  The analysis that Gwen makes of herself is also way off base.  That would be difficult for a very mature 15-year old, and Gwen is not being presented as very mature anyway.<br />The third thing that really annoyed me is that there is not a single lovable character in the book.  March is a pathetic idiot, Richard is a pushover, Alan is scary and let's not even mention Hollis.  There is no redemption for anyone at the end.  This book is not worth your time.mom and dad, Alan's wife, Hollis' wife and son, Richard's parents, Judith Dale.  Most of them died in tragic circumstances or were too young.

She might as well have been describing the whole novel.  There are no redeeming qualities here.  There is not a single lovable character in the entire story.  These are our choices: Mrs. Pusey and her daughter, both of them so divine that probably do not need to ever  go to the bathroom, Monica and her obnoxious dog, the caricature of Mme. de Bonneuil, the hotelier and his airs of grandeur, and slimy Mr. Neville.  We also hear about Penelope, who happens to be Edith's neighbor and best friend, and we can only feel sorry for Edith.  Of course, that sorrow lasts for about 2 seconds, because Edith is a vocational doormat. The descriptions of place are stuffy, and the sky is gray all the time! The ending is depressing, because nothing happens to Edith.  She does not become a better, stronger person after her vacation.  She stays the same way, being a passive, boring pushover.  What I want to know is what the judges of the Booker prize were thinking!  Maybe the competition that year was even more terrible.	2001-09-22

For starters, the name of the book (and the movement) is a total misnomer.  There is nothing shabby about the pricey pieces of furniture this woman uses to decorate her home.  If you want shabby, then go to The Salvation Army.  The shabbiest example in the whole book is the dresser she keeps in her bathroom, and that look is so popular nowadays that i bet you will pay good money to find something similar.  The ornate antiques in her bedroom do not have an atom of shabbiness to them, and same thing with the fabrics chosen.<br />The photos are very beautiful, and as is the case with any decorating magazine or book, i can almost always find a nice detail to copy.  What i found very irritating is that the author or her children were in every other picture.  Not even Martha Stewart exerts such a cult of personality.<br />Also, some of the suggestions the author gives are unrealistic for most of us, because we lack the space or the budget or the time.  How many extra pillows and duvets can you realistically store in your house? And how many of us have housekeepers tending over the place?  Have you ever tried to find affordable antiques in California?!?!  How about the little evening ritual of cookies, tea and flowers?  The author is quite anal when it comes to detail, such as buying beauty products that are color-coordinated with her bathroom.  What's next, combing the fringed ends of the &quot;shabby&quot; area rugs?  The narrative was too aggravating.  Stick to the photos, just in case you find something salvageable.	2001-09-03

Here's a universal truth: at least once in our lives every one of us has fallen in love with the wrong person.  And we have fallen in love despite the fact that we knew perfectly well that s/he meant trouble.  This usually happens when you are young, at a time when it is almost impossible to reconcile hormones with common sense.  There's nothing new here: Shakespeare already dealt with this in Romeo and Juliet, and lots of other authors did it before him. This is the single one thing that Hawke does well in this novel: Portray how incredibly reckless young people are with their lives in the name of &quot;love&quot;.  If it weren't for the fact that kids in their 20's are never going to listen to anyone, this should be mandatory reading.<br />William, who turns 21 in the novel, falls in love/lust with Sarah, who is E-X-T-R-E-M-E-L-Y messed up.  William gets all head over heels about her, and it becomes obvious very quickly that this story is going to have a bad ending.  Sarah has so much rotten baggage that you can chew it in every page.  Hawke is a powerful writer in that he is able to elicit strong emotions from the readers.  I wanted to slap Sarah over the head so badly!  I wanted to tell her: enough with the bull!  Then, i would turn around wanting to do the same thing to William.  I could almost understand the amounts of devastation that William causes when upset (one more sign of the power of testosterone). He destroys kitchen cabinets, his hand, and even drops his contacts on the floor when they feel uncomfortable!<br />Some of the writing is very exaggerated and staged.  If Hawke makes William speak like that because William is an actor, then OK.  However, the climate in some of the situations was not conducive to remembering lines of any kind, so i go for the affectation option.  The end of chapter 12, where William tells Sarah: &quot;I've been you, and i know that you suck&quot;, must be one of the most unfortunate sentences in XX century American Literature.  At the same time, Decker's resolutions for the New Year in Chapter 20 are very wise (&quot;[...] never waste energy degrading someone else.  Also, i want to try not to see life as a competition.&quot;)<br />So, this novel is interesting, easy and fast to read, does a fairly good job at portraying how you can over-dramatize a peanut when you're in your early 20's, but at the same time fails to deliver good quality writing, falling for too many cliches.ture.

The novel starts with 21-year old Sam Swett, drunk and deserting NYC in a southbound truck.  He gets dropped off in a small town of NC, very close to where he grew up.  Eventually, many more characters enter the story.  All are related to one another by virtue of living in a small town.<br />July 7th is Granner's birthday, and the scenes at the party are the best this book has to offer.  Granner's two children, Kate and Harold, are as different as you may imagine.  Kate is pretentious, and cringes every time someone reminds her of her humble origins.  Of course, her brother Harold loves to do that every chance he gets.  The family dynamics at Granner's party become evident, the reactions are hilarious, and overall extremely accurate.<br />What i am most disappointed with are the dialogs between Sam Swett and Corky.  Sam wants to be different but does not know how, and is a very confused person.  Corky is sad, trying to survive a family tragedy.  They make a likely pair at the beginning, but the way their relation came to be is too unrealistic, and i was unhappy about the ending of it.  There was no reason it should have been so.<br />Without giving too much of the ending away, i did not like that there was no resolution to the murder, and that Sam Swett, a man of such strong convictions, never pursued truth in this case.  What a hypocrite!<br />This book could use a good proofreader.  Although i can understand spelling &quot;going to&quot; as &quot;gonna&quot; to emphasize the personality of certain characters, missing commas are unacceptable.	2001-08-22

This one is certainly not filed under that heading, yet it is one of the most inspiring stories i have ever found.  In the days of my long commute to and from work, i listened to a lot of books on tape.  This was one, albeit abridged.  After the recent death of Katharine Graham, i decided to read the book (unabridged).  In my opinion, this is one of the all-time greatest memoirs ever written.  The Pulitzer judges should receive a prize themselves for awarding the honor to this book.<br />The TV series &quot;Dallas&quot; was a smashing success right off the bat.  Why?  I remember the first soap opera to be shown on Spain's public TV:  &quot;The Rich Also Cry&quot;.  That title explains it all!  Yes, the rich and famous have their share of problems and heartaches like the average Joe.  Part of the incredible success Personal History has had is due to this very fact.  Katharine Graham was born in a privileged family, pampered and wealthy, yet she grew up miserable.  She tells about her cold mother and her indifferent father, and does it in a very matter-of-fact way, not asking for sympathy.<br />One thing leads to another, so dull Katharine had to marry flamboyant (and manic-depressive) Phil Graham.  I was very moved when listening to the audio version, because forty years after the fact, she cries when narrating the suicide of her husband.  Even though he was difficult and treated her very badly, she is still in love with him.<br />From being a &quot;doormat wife&quot;, in her own words, she was thrown by circumstances into managing one of the most important newspapers in the world.  Of course, that is today.  When she came aboard The Washington Post, it was an irrelevant paper that very few people cared for.  Katharine did something very important: she surrounded herself of very talented people who advised her in all aspects of the job.  Thanks to that, The Washington post then reached the levels of respect and admiration that it enjoys today.  Nonetheless, she was alone at the top, making the tough calls nobody else had to make.<br />What i find most amazing about these memoirs is how she went from being a doormat to being the most powerful human being in the world.  She did not have extraordinary skills.  In fact, throughout the book it becomes apparent that she was shy, lacked confidence, and that's even after her successes.  All those shortcomings did not prevent her from making crucial, unpopular choices.  It was her decision to go ahead with the Watergate articles that brought down the presidency of the US.  She knocked down the most powerful man on Earth.  That takes some balls!  Pretty good for a &quot;sissy girl&quot;.<br />In summary, poignant, very well written memoirs.  Get the audio book just to enjoy her beautiful voice.  Read the book for awesome insight in the world of politics and the media.the levels of respect and admiration that it enjoys today.

She had a girl, born in 1902.  This was considered a big disgrace in those days in her country, and little is known about the child and her fate.  The author sets to find out what happened to Lieserl.  This book is easy to read, in general, although the abundant number of people interviewed makes it a bit confusing at times.  Fortunately, the author did not forget to include a genealogical tree in the first few pages, to which i referred constantly.<br />Just a few points:<br />· The author stretches facts quite a bit.  For example, on page 175, Einstein is supposed to have written to his ex-wife:  \\"But the heredity of our own children is not without blemish\\", and the author affirms that Einstein \\"was ostensibly including Lieserl\\".  Really?  People speak like this all the time and are not necessarily referring to a love child.  The front cover photo is another example. Zackheim says, \\"This may be the only existing image of Lieserl\\", and the blur she is referring to can also pass as a goat, a fence post or a dahlia.  There are many other examples of these might-or-might-not situations, and the problem is that the author draws too many conclusions from them.<br />· While i was reading this book I could not help but think that her research did not differ all that much from what journalists do when writing an expos&eacute; on a modern day celebrity.  They usually do not have to travel to Central Europe to do so, and do not get financial support from the NEA, but in substance they do the same job. Zackheim speculates whether Einstein and Mileva had sex after their divorce, whether Einstein's syphilis is what caused his children's ailments and all this speculation becomes slightly sordid after a while.<br />· When Woody Allen became tabloid fodder a few years ago, i was very disappointed.  I like what he creates but do not like him as a person.  Same thing with Einstein after reading this book.  He was a genius who revolutionized the way we do science today, but as a human being he was a self-centered, tyrannical, arrogant, miserly,...(and you can add your own list of pejorative adjectives here).  If only half of what Zackheim says is true, he was truly evil, especially to his children.<br />· Zackheim spent a lot of time in Serbia, and her accounts about the war and the difficulties she observed are some of the best writing in the book.  However, she writes about Serbs as an American (and who can blame her? that's what she is).  There is a slight condescending tone whenever she refers to Serbian culture, especially more blatant when talking about any of the male relatives of Mileva (alive and interviewed by her, or long dead).<br />In summary, this is a passable book about an unsolved mystery.  It is entertaining, fast, provides some good information on life in Central Europe from the late 1800's to present, but when you get to the back cover it leaves you dissatisfied.  Ultimately, it did not deliver.his book.

This is a beautiful novel, but beware, it requires more patience than others do. I can understand the complaints of some readers, in that the &quot;story goes nowhere&quot;. In a sense, this book is like a written photograph of the life of Francie, from the time she is 11 until she goes off to college.  Betty Smith created her character and her environment and started crafting a tale about her life in exquisite detail. I enjoyed the &quot;mundane&quot; explanations and descriptions of what she sees or does in her everyday life. I have never been to Brooklyn, but i bet the author is extremely accurate in all her depictions, both of place and people. There is a very sweet, almost innocent touch in her writing style, something i have observed in other writers of her generation. In summary, a wonderful book that is a breath of fresh air in today's literature.	2001-08-03

This is not a pretty story, and can be brutal and uncomfortable at times.  Nonetheless, A.M. Homes does a superb job portraying what happens to be an endemic problem nowadays.  What's with this mindless pursuit of happiness that we are all forced to take?  Paul and Elaine are in their mid forties, suffering a middle-life crisis of sorts.  Although they are very fortunate (healthy, good income, smart kids, beautiful house, good friends and neighbors...), they are miserable people, who spend 358 pages annoying God with their inane complaints.  They are sad, depressed, disoriented, losing perspective of what it means to be a parent, a spouse.  They want 'something' (and cannot seem to figure out what that something is).  They are disrespectful to themselves and to each other, and do a lousy job at parenting.  For example, they find some porn magazines under their son's bed, and leave them exactly as they found them, and never mention anything to him about this.  Attitudes like this are a sign of the times, have a very true ring to them, and are just a taste of things to come.  The ending sounds almost like God  (or your higher power of choice) said:  &quot;So you think you have it bad?  I'm going to show you what bad really is&quot;.<br />Many reviewers have compared &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; to this plot, and there are many similarities.  The dialogs in this novel are great for the most part, although some characters seem very artificial and with forced reactions (the clerk at the hardware store, Bud Johnson, and especially the people that Paul meets in the train are quite a collection, and i don't buy that there are so many weird people using public transit in NY). What's with the stalking cop?  On the other hand, some characters are terrifying and accurate, like &quot;The Date&quot;, Jennifer, Warburton...

However, there are many parents who screen the books their children read, and even some adults who enjoy children's literature (Alison Lurie comes to mind).  This book was passable.  I dare say that had i read it as a 10-year-old, i would have probably thought the same.  The lack of resolution at the end really did it for me.  I enjoyed the premise, how Palmer has to face what he believes to be right and wrong and deal with peer pressure, but I wish he could have bounced these thoughts off his parents, who after all seemed very loving and supportive.  I also enjoyed the little girl's behavior when harassed (\\"el mejor desprecio es no hacer aprecio\\").  The sections about pigeon habits and characteristics are also very interesting, as well as the father explaining the proper placement of troops to Palmer.  The detailed descriptions of how to kill a pigeon, what happens to them afterwards,  and the musk rat episode are rather disgusting, but the intended readers might not be as squeamish as I am.	2001-07-07

In the article, he complained about the packaging executives who created the CD wrapping, and the pineapple!  I had no idea Steve Martin wrote, and that he wrote so well (later on I found out he is a banjo virtuoso, to boot).  This book cannot have a more accurate title.  The short snippets of drivel that are contained in this volume are, however, pure fun.  They range from the absurd (\\"A Word from the Words\\", literally that) to the realistic (\\"Hissy Fit\\", about the animosity that East Coast intellectuals feel over California).  The commentary on \\"Michael Jackson's Old Face\\", contrasting his new face to Walter Matthau's, is an excellent piece, as is \\"I Love Loosely\\", in which Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred debate over whether oral sex is sex at all.  This book is a fast and light read, but very much worth it if you need a laugh.	2001-07-07

However, this novel is a complete disappointment.  For one, there is nothing lovable in Elizabeth as a character.  She is a sad and selfish person who does absolutely nothing to redeem herself.  In fact, she acknowledges at the end how she is 'dangerous' to her own son.  Elizabeth has drifted through life being no good, knowing it, doing nothing about it, and taking advantage of whoever dropped by her side, like a leech.  Maybe it all started because her parents were very indifferent to her, maybe because she felt abused by the variety of pedophiles that crossed her path.  Why the revelations about her mother's past?  Did that explain anything about her behavior?  I was repulsed by Max, because he is unwilling to justify his fatal attraction for Elizabeth ('whatever is, is'), and (to Amy Bloom's credit) also because of his gruesome physique.  I did not understand how Huddie's uncle would &quot;root&quot; for his nephew and then intercept the love letters he was sending Elizabeth.  The relationship between Huddie's parents was never made clear.  Also, there were too many people narrating the story.  The ending is a sheer cliff.  What kind of resolution was achieved?  The part i enjoyed the most was when Elizabeth took care of Mrs. Hill, and the relationship between the two.  Amy Bloom does a very good job describing physicality and the erotic nuances of melons (make sure you always wash your fruit after purchase.  Who knows what your grocer had been licking).  Other than that, this novel is a humongous disappointment.	2001-06-26

It offers a very wide overview on how to preserve nearly all food products, from fruits and vegetables to meat and fish.  It does not give tons of recipes on each category, but this is because this is not a book specifically designed to talk about jams and jellies, or jerkies and sausages.  The photos are awesome.  I strongly believe all cookbooks should be illustrated!  I like to see how the food is going to look in the end.  Also, this book provides you with very good suggestions as to how to present your products, what containers to use, how to finish them (for example, it shows you how to dip the neck of your vinegar bottles in wax, to create a fancy wax seal).  It also has tons of valuable information on all steps of preserving, such as sterilizing, equipment needed, traditional and historical recipes, etc.  If you enjoy cooking and are intrigued by preserving, or if you just want to learn more about the subject, this book is an excellent choice.	2001-06-25

Everything is ruined by the writing style, even the almost salvageable descriptions of the outback and the Malay jungle.  The abundance of irrelevant facts (is Anne Tyler a direct descendant of Nevil Shute?) that drag the storyline along for ages and provide absolutely nothing to the plot was unbearable.  Same thing with the myriad of characters that pepper the pages, which have a half-a-minute cameo appearance, never to be heard of again.  I estimate the adverb 'presently' was used about once per page.  Joe has the adjective 'sheepish' tacked on every other time he is mentioned.  If this book were to become a movie, i would picture Gerard Depardieu playing the part of Big Oaf Joe.  The old lawyer is the narrator of the story, yet how could you narrate dialog taking place between two or three people 12000 miles away?  Surely Jean did not write all that verbatim in her letters!<br />From a documentary standpoint, one could see that this novel uses racial epithets for male and female Aborigines (boongs and lubras) because it is reflecting the spirit of the time (another example is when Jean starts her shop and she decides to have an annex where the colored can go).  However, i do think that the descriptions of the Japanese in the early parts of the novel are very racist.  These descriptions went beyond reporting, and i did not appreciate that.<br />The funniest part of the book is when Joe and Jean finally reveal their love for each other, and Jean almost loses her virginity in the heat of passion.  She and Joe decide to cool it off, and the next morning, when she is taking a bath, she discovers bruises all over her body, and reflects on &quot;the narrowness of her escape from a fate worse than death&quot;.  WOW!  I know the story takes place in post WWII time, but it was hilarious to read those sentiments.<br />There are lots of contradictions in the book.  For example, Joe and Jean go to a semi-desert island for the weekend, and that's when they get passionate.  But they decide they are going to keep their romance a secret, so that the townspeople don't gossip.  Well, what would they be thinking when they saw the young couple take off for the weekend to a paradise island, no chaperone invited???  How about when Jean goes to the ranch overnight?

Although this is not a true memoir, at times it reads like one.  Some of the autobiographical sections are very interesting.  Cokie comes from a privileged background.  She grew up in a very educated family, and she had lots of contact with a very large and loving extended family.  The second fact is not very common to find nowadays, and i read in envy.  I think some people dislike reading about happy childhoods, and criticize anything that strays away from Angela's Ashes.<br />But i digress.  Cokie talks about facts and people that i had never heard about, and to me that is the main benefit of the book.  I plan to read the autobiography of Esther Peterson, for example.  However, as interesting as some of these facts were, i don't think they can save the book.<br />What i found most annoying about the book is the crude generalization that takes place when she writes about how women are connected through time.  Where did she find that soundbyte?  It's hard to connect to women in their 50's who make $500,000/year if you are a 24-year old high-school dropout on welfare (and that's not even including race into the equation). Also, all that talk about women being superwomen is empty of any true value.  While i have to admit it is admirable that her mother cooked the entire banquet for Cokie's wedding by herself while taking care of a toddler grandson and dictating a speech (i freak out when more than 4 people come over for dinner), not everybody is made that way.  In fact it is very good that not everybody is so capable.  Cokie herself admits defeat when she acknowledges how she has missed many important occasions in the lives of her children.  She, like millions of women out there, did it the best she could, but instead of admitting that, she proceeds to gloss over it, like it was no big deal after all.  Contradictions abound, so caveat emptor.  Do not expect deep commentary or analysis.not expect deep commentary or analysis.	2001-06-20

The narrative is good, especially all the details about living in Thailand.  The author even shows a good sense of humor when talking about how hard it is to keep his robe in place, or what happened when the monk in line in front of him was very gassy, and the consequences of Peter moving to the end of the line.  My favorite anecdote is about the inflexions of the Thai language, and how the double meaning that results from mispronouncing something can be very embarrassing (especially when you are talking to a high-ranking abbot).<br />The sections where the author talks about his spirituality are interesting, especially those where he discusses his doubts about Buddhist procedure (what is the point of monks blessing washing machines?).  However, i was terribly let down by a comment he makes regarding a monk leaving the monkshood.  Peter explains what led this monk to make the decision to leave, and even accompanies him to a shop to get 'civilian' clothes.  The final comment in that chapter is so full of sarcasm that i was very disappointed.  Arrogance is one of those worldly things from which Buddhism strives to get away, yet Phra Peter allows himself to be very haughty.  Most people believe their religion to be superior to those of others, but this position, coming from an ordained Buddhist monk, was out of place.<br />In summary, the book is full of interesting anecdotes, some culture shock analysis, and lots of spiritual commentary, plus some attitude.	2001-06-15

Reality is stranger than fiction, and i am convinced that there are kids with experiences far worse than Astrid's.<br />Astrid and her mother, Ingrid, have a very dysfunctional relationship, and Astrid, who is a very perceptive child, picks up on things from very early on.  It's not till the end of the novel that the reader figures out what happened to create this dysfunction between mother and daughter (\\"Make tinkle for Annie\\").  I can understand how Astrid, who is so mad at her mom for getting into trouble and leaving her to the mercy of the State, feels so happy to see her for the first time after her imprisonment, and then how her anger comes back as a tornado after Claire, peaking after the visit from the journalism students.<br />The cast of characters is bizarre, from ...Starr and her boyfriend, to ... Marvel and her family, to Olivia, to Claire, to Rena...  Astrid's final take on their contributions to her life is enlightening, and the positive spin that she places on these experiences is something we all should strive for.<br />The most objectionable part of the book, to me, is Ingrid's falling in love with Barry.  It just doesn't make sense, based on the depictions of Ingrid as a strong, self-sufficient woman.  Other than that, this is a very good novel, the pace is just right, and Astrid (who by the way is narrating all this as an adult, not as a girl) has a very sincere voice and even in the worst moments does not feel sorry for herself.	2001-06-14

At a first glance, he led a very uneventful life, in that he never left his island, and was a simple farmer and fisherman.  However, this is an example of how human nature is endlessly fascinating: the little and big fights between the members of his family, his observations, in retrospect, about what went wrong with this and that other person, the what ifs, his love life, his mom, his devoted sister, the horrible German occupation of Guernsey, and finally his decision over who would be the heir of his money and land.  This is one of the best books i've read this year.  There is so much history, insight, wisdom and humor in these pages that makes this one of those must-read-at-all-costs books.  I would love to go to Guernsey and visit the sights.	2001-06-14

I was hoping to discover a book  that would help me understand what had happened in my relationship, what was the cause of its failure.  Among the many books that i digested during that infamous, awful summer, i stumbled upon this one,  by far the best one. Ellen Gilchrist's essay, \\"Meditations on Divorce\\", has the largest percentage of  truths per square inch of page that i have ever seen. This piece alone is reason enough to purchase  the book, in my opinion. Susan Spano's essay is the one that touched me the most, because her  comments on the concept of morality put the finger right on the wound for me. Morality, a topic that  made her friends (and mine) cringe, but that was at the very core of her problems. My third favorite  essay is Anne Roiphe's, a revision of a divorce that never was but that should have been (her own  parents'). All in all, this is a fantastic collection that helped me immensely, and that i will always  cherish as one of the greatest books of essays i've ever read.	2001-06-14

My first impression is that the author was abusing the 'stream of consciousness' technique, just lost in his thoughts.  But i continued reading and soon realized that there was a reason to the apparent 'madness'.  This book is a concert of thoughts, all centered in a common point.  The tangents or stories in the periphery were designed so skillfully that they complement the story without seeming superfluous: Ruib&eacute;rriz, Celia/Victoria, el &Uacute;nico, all well defined and colorful characters, and the literary quotes mixed in with the text, the movie scenes, all contributing to enhance a plot already captivating.  The main character struggles between decisions already taken or assumed, and the dialogs he has with himself are among the best i have read in Spanish literature in a long time.<br />The ending is unforeseen.  When i thought i knew how things were developing, at the last moment i was surprised.  Life can be so ironic, and laugh so much at our expense (or at De&aacute;n's expense, in this case).<br />The additional notes (another surprise i did not discover till the end) are very interesting, and if i had any doubts about the exceptional writer that Javier Mar&iacute;as is, i lost them completely after reading them.  This novel cannot be missed.	2001-06-12

Mi primera impresi&oacute;n es que el autor se iba por la tangente que daba gusto.  Pero segu&iacute; leyendo y al poco me di cuenta de que de tangentes nada.  Este libro es como un gran concierto de pensamientos, los cuales todos se centran en un punto com&uacute;n.  Esas tangencias o periferias est&aacute;n dise&ntilde;adas con tal habilidad que complementan la historia sin parecer superfluas:  Ruib&eacute;rriz, Celia/Victoria, el &Uacute;nico, todos caracteres bien perfilados, con mucho color, y las citas entremezcladas en el texto, las escenas de pel&iacute;culas, todos contribuyendo a realzar una trama ya de por s&iacute; apasionante.  El protagonista se debate entre decisiones tomadas y asumidas, y sus di&aacute;logos consigo mismo son de lo mejor que he leido en la literatura espa&ntilde;ola en mucho tiempo.<br />El final es imprevisible.

I wonder if Dorris ever watched the movie Rashomon, by Akira Kurosawa, in which the death of a man is told from 4 different points of view, resulting in a confusing yet rich picture of what had happened.  The same thing happens when the three women in the novel talk about those common events.<br />In summary, awesome, awesome narrative; it is terrible that Dorris will not write again.

It had a dedication in the inside cover.  It had been a gift for Mother's Day, and it read:  &quot;To the Queen of the house, because she can't be Beet!&quot;.<br />Erdrich has the special touch to make surreal situations so very believable.  I love the parallel drawn with the plane rides, how in one case it is a beautiful woman running away from responsibility, and on the other it is a not-so-graceful woman running away from scorn.  The birthday party scene is one of the most hilarious that come to mind, with the cake spinning out of control and Mary still singing Happy Birthday to You, while the guests are showered in frosting.  And Mary's fall in the ice and the revered imprint of her face...  How surreal can this book get?!?!<br />In my opinion, it makes sense to read this book first, followed by Love Medicine (93), followed by Tracks (89).<br />I first learned of Erdrich in some anthology, where i read her short story Fleur (now, that's a scary character, who appears in all three books!)	2001-06-06

I really enjoyed &quot;The Love of a Good Woman&quot;, but the stories in &quot;Friend of my Youth&quot; started to sound a bit repetitious after a while.  Of the 10 stories, 7 had a cheating spouse in them.  There were some variations on the theme, but in the most common it was the wife who committed adultery, usually resulting in her abandoning her children and moving somewhere else.<br />This common theme became too hard to bear after a while.  After reading the book i felt overexposed to this (seemingly) widespread malaise of society.  The writing is fine, and the character development is excellent (i can only imagine how hard it must be to achieve this in a short story), but i wish Alice Munro had explored other human passions and/or vices apart from infidelity.	2001-05-21

Therefore, it should not be viewed as a self-help book, or as a treaty on mental disorders, or as a guide.  Some of us did have a happy childhood and loving families and friends, and Dr. Jamison is entitled to write her memoirs as she sees fit.<br />This said, this book brings forth a very interesting issue, by contrast.  She grew up in a most lovable environment and had a terrible time with her disease.  If it was that bad and she had a loving family, i can only imagine how bad it is for those who do not have an understanding circle of friends and family, or financial support, or access to top-of-the-line medical care.  As a reader explained, this book is &quot;manic-depressive illness for the charmed life&quot;.<br />Scientific writing is very straight and does not give any room for artistic license.  One would think that Dr. Jamison, being a writer of scientific literature, would have a somewhat dry prose.  But as a matter of fact, her writing shows a complete reaction against the constraints of scientific writing rules.  Her style could not possibly be more flowery.  Every person described in the book gets four or five adjectives tacked on.  It got very annoying after a while.  We readers would have gotten the point with fewer words.  However, there are times when she makes you smile, like when she bought her horse and soon discovered how financially overwhelming that was.<br />What i found most objectionable about the book is the epilogue, where Dr. Jamison admits she would have chosen to be born with the disorder, because it obviously has given her more than it has taken away.  If i had any doubts about the horrors of manic depression, they were quickly dissipated after reading this book, yet Dr. Jamison beautifies the disease as something precious and coveted, in obvious contradiction with her previous pages.  She mentions that there have been many great artists through history that suffered from manic-depression, and who have made incredible contributions to the world.  I am sure that for every manic-depressive painter, musician and writer in history, there have been a million non-manic-depressive painters, musicians and writers of equal value.  Nature does not want to produce manic-depressive individuals, the same way that it does not want human beings with faulty heart valves, but sometimes glitches happen in our genetic make-up or our development.  Nothing to be ashamed of, but nothing to be proud of either.  Also, it is quite selfish of her not to mention what the cost of her illness has been for her family and friends, because i am sure it was not smooth sailing all the way, regardless of how much she was loved by everybody.ry that suffered from manic-depression, and who have made incredible contributions to the world.

These formulas almost always guarantee bestseller success.  One of the most popular is the &quot;Cinderella&quot;.  It is a surefire way to sell books, and this is why you see it time and time again.  This is how it goes:<br />· Hero or heroine must be born into poverty or come to it fairly quickly in the story.<br />· Hero or heroine must possess extraordinary beauty and/or above-average intelligence.<br />· Hero or heroine is subject to the most hideous trials and tribulations while still a child, and when you think nothing worse can happen to the creature, it does.<br />· Hero or heroine possesses a heart of gold.<br />· Hero or heroine has the opportunity to be equally evil to those that damaged him/her, but because s/he is compassionate, s/he refuses to.<br />· Hero or heroine rises above adversity and survives all calamities<br />·  There is always a happy ending.<br />&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is a perfect example of the &quot;Cinderella&quot; format (some readers called it Oliver Twist, some Jane Eyre; it's all the same).  Chiyo is an extremely beautiful child (the constant reference to her gray eyes became too much too soon) and very smart, whose father is a poor fisherman, not very bright, and whose mother is dying.  She and her sister are sold and soon separated, and poor Chiyo (who will later change her name to Sayuri) suffers enormously for the next 400 pages or so.<br />The best part of this book is its detailed descriptions of all things geisha, from makeup to hair to clothing to ceremonies to education to housing...  After reading the book, i felt that i had learned a lot about this important subgroup of Japanese culture.  I also enjoyed the prose, for the most part.  As a person who sometimes has to explain foreign customs to others, i identified with the tone that Sayuri used when describing things.  The story of young Chiyo is also quite entertaining, from her days in the tipsy house till she gets under Mameha's wing.  After that, the story line goes downhill.  The worst part, from a literary standpoint, is that the book is formulaic, and uses many artificial devices to keep the plot going.  For example, how come Hatsumoto is so bent in destroying Chiyo from the moment she meets the poor girl, who is only 9 years old?  Hatsumoto can't be that much older than Chiyo, yet she is machinating like an old witch, and we do not know exactly for what reason.  Also, Chiyo's encounter with The Chairman is so brief, yet she is so affected by it for years and years to come.  Even though when they met she was crying and her vision was blurry, she remembered his features like they were engraved in her brain. The Chairman and Hatsumoto are artifices to make the story move along.  The flow, especially after Chiyo becomes Sayuri, is really poor.  The intrigues and the &quot;convenient&quot; situations and coincidences that take place really detract from the story.  The final pages are particularly bad.  All of a sudden, the author wanted to wrap it up and there is absolutely no development and scenes just do not make sense.  I can't really explain some of my objections without spoiling the end, but all things related to The Chairman were so very unbelievable.  There is no amount of willing suspension of disbelief to make me swallow the final chapters.<br />People love to see these plots because they are predictable and there is a feel-good quality to them.

However, the text accompanying the images let me down at times because it was corny and somewhat cliched.  Their suggestions for potluck motifs come to mind.  &quot;A Night under the Stars&quot; would feature pate squares with celebrity names written under tiny handprints (!), or maybe cauliflower and asparagus representing shooting stars.  The section on Passalong Plants was also written in that same slightly banal tone, with comments about how forgetful you must be trying to push some daylilies onto your neighbor, when she was the one who gave them to you in the first place, just a few years ago.<br />The overall tone of the book is at odds with the polished image it projects.  This is not so much a utilitarian book as it is a &quot;lifestyle&quot; book.  If you need help deciding how to design a garden path or what to do if your seedlings are damping off, this is not going to be of much help.

Granted, this book is an expose, and as such there is always a lot of dirt to dig through, but i found too many instances where the author did not seem to be impartial on her portrayal of her subject.  Here are my reasons:<br />Example #1: On one of the first pages, Dr. Laura is described as being 'anti-divorce'.  As anyone who has listened to her show for any amount of time, or read &quot;Ten Stupid Things Women...&quot; or read this very book knows, Dr. Laura clearly states that there are 3 reasons that warrant a divorce, and she calls them the 3 A's: Abuse, Addiction, and Affairs.  The offending spouse breaks the covenant of marriage, so it is morally OK to finalize the union.  However, she is very much against frivolous divorces, especially when children are involved.  She has made that clear many times.  Vickie Bane herself includes the 3 A's in the book, yet she makes the blanket statement that Dr. Laura is &quot;anti-divorce&quot;.  This is an obvious contradiction.<br />Example #2: The book says that Dr. Laura's Ph.D. is in Physiology on every other page.  Dr. Laura doesn't make it a secret, and Vickie Bane corroborates that.  Why continue repeating the issue time and time again?  Secondly, even though she is a certified therapist, she does not practice on the airwaves.  She provides moral advice, not therapy.  She says that about 50 times a day.  Vickie Bane also makes a reference to that in the book.  Why continue hammering the fact that her Ph.D. is in Physiology?<br />Example #3: when her son was 2 months old, Dr. Laura went back to teaching her 90-minute long Tuesday evening class.  Her husband would then have to baby-sit the kid.  Vickie Bane mentions that this is a very hypocritical thing to do for someone who is so much against parents going back to work when the kids are little.  Vickie Bane's choice of words surprised me, because it was my understanding that when a parent takes care of his or her child it's called parenting, not baby-sitting.  Why did she choose the verb &quot;baby-sit&quot;, when the baby was with his father?<br />Example #4: Person after person interviewed complained that Dr. Laura made them do something they did not want to do.  Like my Spanish grandpa used to say: &quot;Against the vice of asking, there is the virtue of not giving&quot;.  It is very likely that those people, in retrospect, are angry with themselves for doing things they didn't want to do but were too weak to refuse, and they liked talking about it with Ms. Bane.<br />Example #5:  Vickie Bane starts her book with the account of a visit to Dr. Laura's mother, yet not a word is written about why the distancing between them.  There are thin references to the issue, but nothing concrete.  Like in most instances, a relationship goes south due to combined efforts, but the readers of this book will never get that idea.<br />Example #6: Vickie Bane includes the minutia about the divorce settlements, who got what car and what portion of the pension plan, as if that was very relevant.  The space spent describing the asset division could have been put to better use explaining the nature of Dr. Laura's estrangement with her mother, for example.<br />So this is it, when it comes to content.  Regarding style, it doesn't get any better.  I found the frequent &quot;I felt kind of like...&quot;, &quot;she kind of decided...&quot; statements excruciating to read.  I know that Ms. Bane is a journalist, but the fact that she had to include names, and past and current occupations every time she talked about someone was also very distracting and did not help the flow.<br />Read the book (it's cheap) and form your own opinion.  Those of you who dislike Dr. Laura will probably cheer all the way, those who like her will probably feel disappointed with the quality of the book.hy did she choose the verb &quot;baby-sit&quot;, when the baby was with his father?<br />Example #4: Person after person interviewed complained that Dr. Laura made them do something they did not want to do.

US	52987300	REV0UKVTVNVIT	0002251760	216487725	The Forgetting Room	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Blood is thicker than water	I love the disclaimer about Garc&iacute;a Lorca's quotes, in which Nick Bantock blames any inaccuracies on his characters' faulty memories!<br />This story takes place in Ronda, a beautiful city in Malaga, Spain.  The descriptions of the city are great, and the famous bridge (&quot;El Tajo del Co&ntilde;o&quot;) is central to the story.  I wish that the original painting that Armon makes of it had not been so obscured by the other elements of the collage.  There were a few more things that bothered me.  Paolo and Francesca are Italian names, not Spanish.  &quot;Casa&quot;, not &quot;cassa&quot;, is Spanish for &quot;house&quot;.  The appearance of Ceres is rather superfluous, and i do not know that she provides much to the story, other than to reiterate that Rafael was a special kind of man, and we already knew that.  The ghostly images and hallucinations that Armon experiences in the final chapters are also a bit over the top.<br />Armon goes into a meditative mode once he arrives in Ronda.  Reading between the lines, it is suggested that he was ripe for the epiphany he experiences towards the end.  However, the transformation he suffers, the happiness and thirst for life that envelop him so rapidly, are far-fetched.  You cannot shed your skin like if you were a snake at molting time.  The very essence of you remains always with you, and Armon's melancholy is Armon himself.<br />The best part of the book, to me, is the analysis that Armon makes of his family relationships.  The introspection that he experiences in the solitude of the studio is described in an exquisite way.  I wonder how much autobiographical stuff is in Armon.<br />This novel is to me much more satisfying that the Griffin and Sabine Trilogy, despite discrepancies, artifice and Italian vocabulary.  Armon's conversations with himself make this book worth it.  One of the editorial reviews calls it a 'fairy tale', and that's right on the money.	2001-04-17

Yo es que no he leido nada de Gonzalo Torrente Ballester hasta este momento, pero es que este libro me ha decepcionado una barbaridad, en parte por el prestigio que tiene el autor.  Es una novela plana, en la que no hay argumento.  Un par de chicas hu&eacute;rfanas, Cristina y Chon, regresan a su pueblo natal a vivir con su t&iacute;a.  Las chicas se ponen a trabajar, Chon se echa novio, su reputaci&oacute;n se va a la porra gracias a los comentarios de una envidiosa conocida, el novio la deja, Cristina se marcha a otro pa&iacute;s, la t&iacute;a se muere, Chon alquila un piso a la calumniadora (f&iacute;jate, ahora tan amigas), y termina cas&aacute;ndose con un admirador de su madre.  Hay situaciones sin resolver, caracteres que aparecen y desaparecen sin desarrollo alguno, en fin, una trama muy flojita que me ha dejado con mal sabor de boca.

Sybil and her New-Age take on life, her (ab)use of words like &quot;magical&quot; and &quot;energy&quot;.<br />3.

After the breakup, when Jane starts researching male behavior heavily, the novel got more engrossing.  I liked the scientific mumbo-jumbo interspersed along the chapters quite a bit, and i found those tidbits very informative.  But towards the end, i became disappointed.  It all started with the master plan to have Dr. Marie Goodall write these mystery articles in a men's magazine.  Hmmm...  In real life, how long till your editor starts digging into your magic plan?  Was Ben such a moron who couldn't smell the scheme?  Also, why did it take so long for Eddie to figure it all out?<br />The ending is terrible.  It sounds almost like the author was taking it easy and all of a sudden her agent called and told her the publishers wanted the book on their desk by tomorrow, so she frantically grabbed a pen and scribbled the final pages.<br />So, there are worthy parts, towards the center, and there are worthless parts, at the beginning and the end.  This makes it a bell-shaped book.  Unless they've done some serious facelifting with the movie, i cannot foresee it being interesting either.	2001-04-05

I can be petty and focus on the son, who is too perfect a teenager, or focus on the miraculous cure of Mr. Ives' skin disease, or focus on his Catholic beliefs and how promptly and frequently he engaged in fornication with Annie (before holy matrimony!).  But somehow i have to give this book a grand total of 5 starts, because its positive aspects far outweigh my criticisms.  I love the vignette format, because it is not only a fresh approach to telling a story, but also the very way we recount a life.  Hijuelos does a superb job describing the fossilizing of Ives' feelings, his self-pity disguised as stoicism, Annie's frustration, Ramirez's way of being (by far, the most endearing character in the book; i cried when i read about his travel bag and its contents).<br />Funny that the novel spans over 70 years of the life of Mr. Ives, because the pace is fast and the narrative is colorful, yet refined.  The core of the book, Mr. Ives' feelings and religious sentiment, plus his wondering about identity and background, are examined with an elegant simplicity, despite the conflicting emotions he has in both counts.  This is an excellent portrayal of a good man, who puts his money (and time, and effort) where his mouth is, the very essence of Christian love.  What a sweet human being.  How touching the scene where he follows a woman fantasizing that she is his birth mother, and he is somehow protecting her from potential muggers.  How touching that he enjoys the ethnic diversity and his dealings with the Hispanic and Black communities.  How could anyone possibly not enjoy Mr. Ives in all his goodness?	2001-03-27

It takes a great writer to meet them.  Most times, i am disappointed when the mystery character is finally unveiled.  This was the case with Zenia.  What's so special about her?  Why was she so set on breaking marriages and relationships apart?  Did she have some special vendetta going on?  None of that is explained, which leaves me asking too many questions.<br />I agree with one of the editorial reviews that states how each one of the friends is almost a cliche of a lifestyle.  The most realistic character is Roz: her sense of defeat is quite palpable, and that is more than i can say about anyone else.  Charis is rather pathetic, an old hippie still holding to the idea of peace and love, still not aware of what a joke her life has been: under the pretense of &quot;love one another&quot;, lots of people have taken advantage of her, and she has allowed it, and she is still allowing it with her own daughter, August.<br />If you are new to Atwood, pick something else!	2001-03-13

JCO draws a terrific portrayal of a girl gang in upper NY State in the 50's.  The way they became a gang was not to cause harm, but as a way to protect themselves from the horrible abuses that they faced on their day-to-day lives.  How can these girls ultimately become so brutal, cold and heartless?  Surprise, surprise: it all starts at home.  They also wanted to protect others, their sisters, from abuse and injustice.  As one reader pointed out, how many times have you been groped and insulted?  Was there anything you could have done about it?  Well, the Foxfire girls put their feet down and decided to retaliate.  However, their sense of retaliation went too far, and they caused more damage than good at the end.  As with anything in life, self-righteousness always takes the better part of you.<br />Another excellent point that the book covers is group dynamics.  Teamwork and its multiple facets, the roles people assume in a group context, the cliques, the power plays, and the dominating/submissive personalities.<br />I am surprised no one has brought up the erotic overtones of these relationships, especially between Legs and Maddy.  Is it sisterly love only?  In my opinion, these girls were so hungry for love and their interactions with males had been so catastrophic that by exclusion they were inclined to homosexuality.  Although these feelings were never realized, they are so real and so complete that 40 years later Maddy still cries about Legs.<br />This is one of those texture books, where you can intensely see, smell, taste, and hear what is going on in the page.  The scenes about Legs in solitary confinement are particularly vivid.<br />I like the ending a lot, from the time of Maddy's visit to Rita, to the final comments about the transcripts.  JCO is a master at what she does.  She was able to concentrate the whole essence of the book in one final sentence, one of the most brilliant endings i have ever read.	2001-03-13
US	52987300	R9MBCCJ3YCPV4	0786813733	571447109	The Window	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Rayona is not real	I loved A Yellow Raft in Blue Water, but was very disappointed with this book.  The thing that annoyed me the most is that Rayona speaks like an adult, yet in this story she is 11 years old.  Her reflections, her observations about her surroundings, are not in synch with the thoughts of a pre-pubescent girl, no matter how mature and developed she is.  I wish the author had taken this fact into consideration.  Also, some of the vignettes, especially the one with the Potters and with Mrs. Jackson, have no development at all.  These episodes are mentioned almost in passing.<br />What touched me the most are Rayona's ambivalent feelings for her mother.  However, the way that Rayona verbalizes those feelings is way too mature and rational for a child her age.<br />I'd be curious to hear the opinions of the intended readers, the kids.  Maybe they are more forgiving than i am.  Once again, the willing suspension of disbelief fails me.  A Yellow Raft in Blue Water, though, is not to be missed.  Rayona is a teenager by then, and it's a totally different playfield.	2001-03-05

How many times in the book is he ready to throw everything away?<br />· He writes truthfully not just about the rocket project, but about his feelings for his dad, his brother, his friends, the girl of his dreams, his teacher...<br />· The excellent portrayal of life in a mining town in WV in the late 50's.  The community is slowly disintegrating due to the failing economics of coal, yet they find cohesion by rooting for the rocket project in unison.  This is why the entire town would attend rockets launches and cheer and clap.<br />· The wonderful side characters, like the machinist who helps the guys by building special pieces, the dad, torn between his own stubbornness and the love for his son...<br />BEWARE! The movie is a triumphant Hollywood view of a successful, starry-eyed, brave and determined young man with a cuasi-perfect life.  If we listen to the book, though, Homer was bullied, scared, intimidated, ready to quit, and had to overcome lots of opposition to achieve his dream.  You might want to rent the movie to check out the last 3 minutes or so, because there is actual footage of many of the characters in the book, plus rocket launches!  Other than that, the movie is a terrible adaptation of the book and doesn't do it any justice.	2001-03-02

I have one of those page-a-day calendars with book recommendations, and this title popped out with a very enticing synopsis.  I found the book at the library and started reading it over the weekend.  After 50 or so pages, the book is going back.<br />There are some things i expect in a novel.  For example, i am big on character development.  If the author doesn't spend some time making the characters real, i am left unhappy.  In the first 50 pages of the book, i have encountered Linda, Margaret and JoJo, all of whom are very poorly defined, with somewhat irrational attitudes that do not make sense.  Even Camel is a bit terse in his explanations.  Let me elaborate:<br />Camel:  he is married to a woman for over 16 years, and has not detected there is anything wrong in his marriage until his final conversation with Linda.  He is a brilliant cop with a radar for lies, but can't pick anything up at home.  OK, even though i have a hard time believing that he was not aware of the lies or the deception, i can't buy that he was unaware about the lack of debt. You've got to be in a deep coma not to have a feel for your own personal finances.  While it is true he was working 60-hour weeks, this was not all along, and in those 16 years he never questioned why Linda wasn't asking him for more money?<br />Linda:  If life was so miserable with Camel, why stick around for 16 years, having a rich father who would be happy to take you back in?  And she cheated on Camel as newlyweds?<br />Margaret:  Why doesn't she want to see her dad ever again?  Yes, he wasn't there much, but he was not abusive to her, and i'd like to think that she would have developed some love for her father as a kid.  And then Camel doesn't even pursue visitation rights.<br />JoJo:  Would you ever talk to a policeman the way she did it in her first visit?  Her introduction is to call Camel an idiot to his face.  And she is an executive secretary?  Even in novels executive secretaries are expected to have manners.<br />And that's as far as i went.  I am not willing to keep suffering every time i stumble upon a cliche or something that does not make sense.  I would love to know who did it and why, but the aggravation i would have to pay is too much.  Moving on!e manners.  <br />And that's as far as i went.

My favorite characteristic of Alison Lurie as an author is the mental processes she puts her characters through.  You can hear them thinking, evaluating options, scenarios, possibilities, and she dissects these thoughts in such a clear way that it is extremely easy to develop a deep sense of camaraderie with them.  Probably more than half of the book is devoted to Polly's reflections, and the result is two-fold: you get to know Polly very well, and you get to know Lorin very well.<br />Sometimes, in a book or a movie, when the characters talk about another who has yet to appear, the reader or viewer creates some expectations about that person.  It is very easy to aggrandize that character beyond what they really are.  The movie All About my Mother and the novel The Robber Bride come to mind as examples.  In the case of The Truth about Lorin Jones, Lorin, who is dead from the get-go, comes out as a very realistic, palpable, flesh-and-blood protagonist.  I love the confusion that Polly goes through when listening to her interviewees speak in such different terms about Lorin.  I think the character development, Polly's inner voice, and the juxtaposition of determination and confusion on her part make this book the great work it is.<br />Although Alison Lurie has been criticized as being a rabid feminist, I think that in this book she offers a very critical view of the feminist philosophy and ways.  This analysis starts right off the bat when discussing Polly's failed marriage.  Quite frankly, it was Polly's own doings that caused the dissolution of her married life.  Although Polly refuses to see her part of responsibility in the failure (a denial also fed by Jeanne), towards the end of the book she recognizes how she deserves a huge chunk of the blame.<br />Some of the secondary characters are very amusing to watch, like Jeanne.  She is a very troubled woman, but also very self-righteous and extremely hypocritical, all in the name of political correctness.  She is no better than the men she despises, because after all she is a conspirator in infidelity (her affair with Betsy, a married woman), she manipulates Polly to her advantage (she uses Polly as a \\"distraction\\" when it suits her), she is vindictive (her attitude towards Stevie when he accidentally breaks the tea pot), she advocates sweet-talking in order to get what one wants (and she uses the technique to make Polly agree to her demands), etc.  I am so glad Alison Lurie has had the guts to tackle this issue in such a direct way.  Her portray of certain sectors of the feminist community is poignant and not only is she telling the truth about Lorin Jones, but about the Jeannes and Idas of the world.<br />Alison Lurie is a fine, fine writer, and I can't think of anyone whose character development is as detailed and yet so simple and easy to follow.is no better than the men she despises, because after all she is a conspirator in infidelity (her affair with Betsy, a married woman), she manipulates Polly to her advantage (she uses Polly as a \\"distraction\\" when it suits her), she is vindictive (her attitude towards Stevie when he accidentally breaks the tea pot), she advocates sweet-talking in order to get what one wants (and she uses the technique to make Polly agree to her demands), etc.  I am so glad Alison Lurie has had the guts to tackle this issue in such a direct way.

The photos are nice, but this doesn't even qualify as a coffee table book (it's too small).  The author seemingly hanged out in Southern Spain visiting her bohemian friends and acquaintances and taking many pretty photos.  The commentary is quite lame, and the author has a slight pontificating tone when detailing the Spanish decorating styles.  I think it was George Bernard Shaw who said that generalization is the prerogative of the weak of mind, or something to that effect.  The author falls under that category when stating that the new generations of Spaniards would rather go for plastic, vinyl and Formica and get rid of old, moth-ridden furniture.  In her visit to Spain she obviously did not visit any of the multiple antique stores in any major city.  Had she seen the prices that some of those moth-ridden pieces of junk command, and in the unlikely event she understands the laws of offer and demand, maybe she would have refrained from making such a blanket statement.<br />Anyway, this is a superficial book, certainly not worth the list price.	2001-02-20

I love Alison Lurie because she is a genius at studying the psychology of her characters.  In this book, both Tates are dissected and their thoughts analyzed, verbalized and explained to full clarity, and this makes them so easy to understand, and therefore to love or hate.  My favorite part of the whole book is when Erica starts measuring the pros and cons of something in her head.  Lurie is so structured in her analysis, it's almost impossible not to follow her thread.  Moreover, this novel analyzes the disintegration of a marriage, and the dynamics and motivations are so universal and so timeless that they can be applied to the 60's or to the 00's alike.	2001-02-20

Some are more interesting, and better written  than others.  The essay by David Mura was a bit creepy.  I got the feeling he is vicariously living his bicultural experience through his daughter, because David scrutinizes the girl's actions and reactions.  All in all, a bit too unsettling for my taste.  My favorite story in the collection is Malcolm Gladwell's, because it is honest and subdued, and he has excellent descriptions of his charismatic father and gentle mother.  Philippe Wamba's essay is my second favorite, maybe because he had a happy childhood and is not afraid to admit so in a book marinated in sad recollections of youth.  Another noteworthy essay is Lori Tsang's.  I loved her tongue-in-cheek style and the kind irreverence she uses when speaking about her Chinese and Jamaican elders.<br />The essay that provoked me the most was Francisco Goldman's.  He tells of his sad visit to Madrid, Spain, in the mid-80's.  Not only was he discriminated for looking Moroccan (he is not), but he barely made any friends in the 6 months he was there.<br />I can understand his outrage at the pervasive bigotry that he experienced.  While it is true that there are areas of Spain far more sympathetic to other races (and Francisco realizes and says so in his essay), I have been too many times a witness to racism, especially towards moros and towards gypsies.  Ironically, i grew up hearing that Spaniards are not bigots, because when we went to the Americas we procreated liberally with the natives!<br />But i digress: Francisco is lonely in Madrid, and ruminates over his solitude for quite a few pages.  Just about the same time he was in Madrid experiencing La Movida, i was experiencing heavy-duty culture shock in the US.  It is extremely easy to be miserable in a cosmopolitan place if you miss your people, your language, your food, everything.  It's all about your frame of mind.  Francisco experienced, along with discrimination, some culture shock.  Not even seasoned reporters are immune to it.<br />Like many collections of essays or short stories, this book is a good showcase of talent.  I always enjoy finding out more about an author and pursuing his or her works later on.  I will be on the lookout for books by Wamba, Tsang and Gladwell for sure.shock.

The Saint Paul Pioneer Press says:  \\"Patty Jane's House of Curl has the emotional warmth of Lake Wobegon and the tender/tough female characters who populated Fried Green Tomatoes...\\"<br />When you compare yourself to someone else, you are immediately settling for second place, because this is how frames of reference work. I have never been a big fan of Lake Wobegon, but I enjoyed Fried Green Tomatoes a lot, and Patty Jane's House of Curl is nowhere near it.<br />PJHC is a sappy story of two sisters who face all kinds of disasters in the 15 or so years the book spans.  The sheer avalanche of catastrophes and mishaps crashed against my suspension of disbelief time and time again.  Some characters, like Avel, are ridiculous and simply unbelievable.<br />Some scenes were very predictable from pages and pages before.  Some scenes were just corny, like when Clyde and Patty Jane finally consummate their passion, or when Thor appears at Harriet's door with the music box.  Sappy, corny, bland melodrama, more apt to succeed on early afternoon television.<br />Finally, I disliked the fact that Nora is the narrator of the introduction and the epilogue, but the rest of the novel is narrated by the author.  Nora would have made a better narrator.  The sappiness that permeates the book is out in Nora's sections.<br />If you want to read about female tender/tough characters, go for Fried Green Tomatoes.  The audio version is definitively the way to go.  The author herself reads the book, and she does a terrific job!	2001-02-18

However, in the context of mystery novels, this is pretty decent.  The book is an easy read, ideal for a plane ride or a leisurely weekend.  Alice, as a main character, is pretty pathetic.  The short snippets of conversation between her and her ex husband made me cringe.  I had far more respect for the killer, a sturdier person all in all.  I agree with some readers in that it is fairly easy to figure out who did it.  Anyhow, a Pulizter Prize winning author doesn't have to write Pulizter Prize material all the time!	2001-02-13

To me, it was a very hard, dissatisfying read.  As a reader, i prefer to have more structure and more guidance from the author.  I found Can Xue's stories disjointed and poorly integrated.

Of course, i had not realized Kate Chopin had some of her characters speak in dialect.  This is something that i have never been able to overcome.  There is a reason why written language is standardized, so that it is comprehensible!  I don't care if it's in English or Spanish; i have a hard time going through that kind of text.  Those stories took me a long time to read, and eventually i lost interest and skipped through entire paragraphs.<br />The best story, in my opinion, is the one that gives name to the collection.  We are creature comforts, and need the occasional pampering.  The woman in the story lets herself be spoiled just for one day, no matter how good and unselfish her intentions were for the money.  I can identify with her weakness.<br />The 'romantic' stories were quite bland, and that, combined with the incomprehensible Acadian-speak, did not leave me with a good impression about this author.	2001-02-07

I've had and maintained plenty of strong male friendships through the years.  Because of the career i chose, the vast majority of my colleagues in school and in my professional life have been men.  I work with mostly men now.  I supervise a staff of three women, and there is no doubt in my mind my life would be easier if they were men.  I have married twice.  In summary, i love men, i feel at ease with them, i enjoy observing them, i like the camaraderie, the lack of pettiness that is so very feminine.  Yet there are some things about men that annoy the heck out of me.  This book does an excellent job at portraying those things.<br />I remember when this book hit the stores a few years ago.  I heard at least three men (two in person, one on the radio) complain that the book was giving away secrets about the male psyche.  That was the biggest laugh i got from this book.  Basically, the story is about a guy, a bit of a loser, whose heart (feel free to substitute the word 'heart' for 'pride', or even 'gonads') has been broken, yet again.  He commiserates and philosophizes with his equally inept friends for the entire length of the novel.  One good point about the book is that it portrays how infantile 30-something single males can be when left in a pack.  This is a universal truth, valid in England and the US alike.  My recommendation is that you must be entertained observing infantile behavior of the male species to enjoy this novel.	2001-01-26

The subject matter or matters (growing up in a mixed-race family in Harlem in the 60's, growing up Orthodox Jew in the South in pre WWII years) i found fascinating.  The way the stories are told, though, is unbalanced.  Ruth is a fantastic storyteller, but she offers no introspection at all.  James, on the other hand, is great at sharing his feelings, but fails as a narrator.  His style is choppy and disjointed.  An example of what i mean is Helen's story (i was glad to see that another reader agreed with me on this one).  James wrote about the fights and disagreements that teenager Helen had with Ruth, and then that's it.  No mention of Helen is made again till we find out she has a degree in Nursing.  Maybe James decided to skip all those years in benefit of other, more important topics, but somehow the transition from Helen to the next thing was too abrupt and certainly left me disappointed.  Also, very little is said about his siblings as adults, except for the lists of degrees and academic accomplishments that they have achieved.  It would have been nice to learn a bit more about them.  While it is true Ruth is the main character, more information on the siblings would have been a great addition to the book.<br />One thing that was in the back of my mind while reading the book was the sheer number of children that Ruth had.  Unless their religious beliefs forbade the use of contraception, Ruth and her husbands were simply out of their minds.  I am sure you can love 12 children the same, but i am equally sure you cannot take care of 12 children the same.  You cannot devote the same amount of time to each one, and a 15 year-old needs as much time from his/her parents as a 15 month-old.<br />I must admit i expected more.  This was one of those books that i really, really wanted to like, but that let me down at the end.  Someone mentioned Angela's Ashes as an obvious comparison, and i have to agree.an obvious comparison, and i have to agree.	2001-01-19

This book by Maeve Binchy is a first for me, and probably a last.  Before i wrote this review, i read what others had thought, and someone complained that the story begs for a plot, and that it is much better to read the first 300 pages and skip to the last 100.  I can't agree more.  In fact, that's basically what i did with the tapes.  I went all the way through tape 4, returned the audio book to the library, and checked out the printed version, where i skipped to the end.  The story has a lot of fluff, a lot of filler, and therefore it becomes draggy and lackluster.  The last pages were a bit more interesting, but the end was a big letdown for me.  There are too many issues that are left unanswered, such as Kit's inheritance, Louis' new life and repercussions, Emmet's romance with Anna...  I would be extremely interested in reading justifications as to why this is such a long, drawn out story, when the basics could have been very well told in less than half the book.  The result would have been much brighter.	2001-01-18

It is important to listen to both sides of a story to get the real picture of what is going on.  Nowhere is this more true that when it comes to man-woman relations.<br />I love books that have unusual formats.  This one immediately caught my eye.  I read Brenda's story first, then Jack's.  Amazingly enough, after 20 years living together, they are still somewhat strangers to each other, yet they have a fine marriage, with harmony, peace, fulfilling sex, the works.  Brenda goes away for one week to a quilters' convention and both she and Jack are presented with itchy temptation.  The most entertaining point of the novel for me is their feelings towards the other's creativity.  In her absence, Jack meditates about Brenda's quilts and her determination, and feels rather jealous about it.  In his absence, Brenda thinks about Jack's book and his writer's block, and feels rather irritated about his sloth.  The array of miscellaneous characters are interesting, although some are extremely annoying (the convention organizers, for example).  Not a bad novel by an excellent author, who nevertheless has created better works.	2001-01-14

It can be another Nostradamus guide.  It would be fun to check it every decade or so and see how many things the book predicted that have become reality.  In fact, the idea of a truth machine is not totally without basis.  A few months ago i saw something on TV that was also called The Truth Machine.  In the program, a professor from a university in the Midwest (i should have been paying more attention!  Sorry for the lack of specifics) explained that when the suspect of a crime reads information that would only be known to the perpetrator, the brain has a response that can be measured with his machine, therefore suggesting that the suspect might be guilty indeed.  An innocent person, when reading the same information, would not show that same kind of brain activity.  This machine is being studied by prosecutors as one more tool to use in the evaluation of crimes.  The same way that electric cars and organ transplant were science fiction a few years ago, the truth machine can be a reality soon.  I only hope they do offer amnesty, like in the book!  Story-wise, though, this book is a lightweight.  The redeeming quality of this book is its vision of the future, certainly neither the plot nor the characters.	2001-01-09

I thumbed through the pages at the bookstore, saw postcards prefacing almost every chapter, and was immediately attracted to the novel.  I had no idea, though, that it was going to be this good.  I have been hooked up on this book to the very end, yet this is not a happy, pretty novel.  This was hard reality, ugliness and bad luck in every other page, strangely compelling chapter after chapter.  I would say there was very little fiction in this book, and that's what made it so good for me.<br />As an aside: just a few days ago, i reviewed Beach Music, by Pat Conroy, and my main criticism is that it dealt with many, many story lines that did not connect well.  The end result was an 800-page mishmash of tales and situations that left me with a sense of annoyance.  Postcards is a perfect example of how in barely 300 pages you can have dozens of lives and places and situations in harmony.  It just takes some skill on the part of the author (one of the tricky parts of writing).<br />These are some of the things that make this novel so excellent, in my opinion:<br />1: Her character development is fabulous.  If Loyal is not a walking example of karma, i don't know what is.  How could one feel sorry for a criminal?  Yet i could.  And Dub, proof of how ironic life can be.  Mink, born miserable.  Jewell and her renaissance.  Witkin and his sense of emptiness.  These characters were flesh and blood, not paper.<br />2:  Her descriptions of place are brilliant.  I have never been in a dairy farm, but i feel like i have.  The smells, the grime, the bitter cold, the absence of electric light.  The insides of the caved mine.  The desert and the heat.  It was not difficult to visualize any of these places, because her detailed portrayal was so vivid and complete.<br />3:  Her situations are remarkable.  Loyal's journey throughout the country is an excellent account of life from post-war years till the late 80's.  The very colorful characters and situations he encounters.  The many lives he lives.<br />If i could give more stars to this book, i would.  This is a magnificent first novel by an author i will keep in mind forever.characters and situations he encounters.

One just has to go check out the comments, and see how few three-star scores this book has received, and how many fives and ones.  I already know i am going to get lots of negative votes, not because my review is not helpful, but because lots of readers are going to disagree with me.  As my Spanish grandpa used to say, &quot;En el Libro de los Justos, Cada Cual Tiene su Gusto&quot; (&quot;In the Book of the Fair, Each One Has His Own Taste&quot;).  Well, here we go:<br />This book was a terrible waste of my time, for the following reasons:<br />1:  There are way too many plots, connected to each other by feeble suspensions of disbelief.  The end result looks like a 60's afghan, made with mismatched neon colors.  I enjoy the straying away from the main road that many authors have mastered (John Irving comes to mind).  At times, the most interesting, colorful, fascinating characters and situations are the secondary ones.  In this case, none of that happens.  Pat Conroy could have created at least 4 books from this one, rather than compressing all these story lines into an 800-page monstrosity.<br />2: The vast majority of the characters are, in my opinion, too melodramatic, way off line, and as a result, totally unbelievable.  The most offensive of all is the schizophrenic brother.  What a horrible disservice is Conroy doing to schizophrenics of this world and their families by portraying the disease the way he does.  He ends up looking like an eccentric uncle.  If Conroy had described other diseases in the book the same way he treats schizophrenia, the mother would have dealt with her cancer with Tylenol and plenty of napping.<br />3:  More on characters: i have never read a book where everyone was so gorgeous.  Maybe if the novel had taken place in Southern California....<br />4:  Conroy's writing is incredibly uneven.  There are times when his descriptions work, and he does a fine job explaining and elaborating on a story.  Other times, his writing is a collection of regurgitated clich&eacute;s.  It looks like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde co-authoring a novel.<br />5:  More on (un)willing suspensions of disbelief:  killing yourself because parental grief is too much of a burden.  The wife killed herself because she could not deal with HERSELF.  She had problems no matter what had happened to her parents, no matter what her heritage was.  Why make it look like she could not handle her parents' history?  This was an artificial move on Conroy's part, which totally disgraces the novel (and happens too early on to forgive).<br />I understand that Pat Conroy has produced some other fine books, and certainly many people think Beach Music is terrific.  I cannot recommend this book to anyone looking for a serious read.

It is easy to get to know them, they become flesh and bone, and as a consequence, the reader develops empathy with them, even with the evil ones.  This novel has the advantage of having a main character that becomes lovable right off the start.  Maybe lovable is not the right word, but Quart is tormented by his past and present circumstances, and these put his role in perspective.  The main objection i have with the book is with the identity of the hacker.  I know in this day and age everything is possible, but my willing suspension of disbelief has a limit...<br />One thing i cannot stand in a book is when the author gives you obvious clues as to what is going to happen next.  I want a book that makes me work.  I want to be surprised and i want to be right every so often.  In the case of this book, i guessed certain things, and i was surprised by others.<br />I am partial to this book because it takes place in my favorite country and my favorite city.  This book reads so much better in Spanish!  The nuances of the language, the beautiful, sometimes archaic words that the author uses under the excuse of describing archaic things and people...

These are worthy topics that would make a fine book, but this is not one.  At the end, when i put down the book, i was left asking too many questions.<br />My biggest objection is that many of the characters do not seem real and consequent.  People can certainly change, but i do not believe that they can change 100%.  There is something that always remains from your previous self.  Eddie seems to have achieved a 100% transformation from his past.  The author presents old Eddie as a pusher, assassin, wife-beater and evil person, and new Eddie as a vegetarian, Buddhist, Tai Chi lover, tea-drinking, balanced individual.  Even though Eddie makes references to his past here and there, i find very little connection between then and now.  New Eddie is too perfect and too gentle, and he ends up looking unreal.<br />Another character that looks forced is Gerry.  She is angry and self-righteous, and it does not make sense.  She was supposed to keep a very low profile, after how things had gone for her husband back in Chicago.  Instead of showing her simply in denial (understandable), she is portrayed as a vindictive woman who will stop at nothing (unreasonable).<br />The story is quite predictable.  You know Ava and Eddie are going to get romantic after the first few pages.  Then the author makes it very easy for you to complete scenes.  As soon as i read about Joyce and Eddie being away for the night, i knew the hoodlums were going to break into the house.  As soon as the baby was taken by the social worker, i knew something bad was going to happen.  As soon as i read about the &quot;practice&quot; session at the Sewing Circle, i knew Gerry was going to drop by.  This kind of predictability is to me one of the greatest disappointments i can find in a book.  I expect to be surprised.  Of course i also want to be right on some of my hypotheses, but in this book i was right too many times.<br />The biggest secret of the story is hinted at during the visit that Ava and Joyce pay to the Reverend.  Both women, who prove during the development of the story to be smart and perceptive, didn't jump on the comment that the grandson makes about the Reverend.<br />This book is a lightweight (the title should have tipped me).  Sure, one can feel empathy for some of the characters, but from a literary standpoint, this book misses the mark, in my opinion.expect to be surprised.

Es f&aacute;cil llegar a conocerlos, se hacen de carne y hueso, y en consecuencia el lector desarrolla una empat&iacute;a con ellos, incluso con los malos de la historia.  Esta novela, adem&aacute;s, tiene la ventaja de poseer un personaje central que se hace inmediatamente de querer.  Es extra&ntilde;o, ya que el Padre Quart no es entra&ntilde;able, pero sus circunstancias, pasadas y actuales, ponen su papel en perspectiva favorable.  Hablando de caracteres realistas, el que m&aacute;s dificultad tuve en aceptar es V&iacute;speras.

Its main virtue is that it gives you a light at the end of the tunnel.  You get to realize how similar the steps you're going through are those listed by the authors, and that gives you hope, because you know that eventually the pain will decrease.  It is a matter of faith.  I found the poems interspersed throughout the book to be beautiful and truthful.  During my time of crisis, i held on to this book at all times, and opened it at random, read a few pages, or looked for a passage in particular, and it never failed to make me feel better.<br />These people knew what they were writing about!	2000-12-11

I was hoping to discover a book that would help me understand what had happened in my relationship, what was the cause of its failure.  Among the many books that i digested during that infamous, awful summer, i stumbled upon this one, by far the best one.  Ellen Gilchrist's essay, \\"Meditations on Divorce\\", has the largest percentage of truths per square inch of page that i have ever seen.  This piece alone is reason enough to purchase the book, in my opinion.  Susan Spano's essay is the one that touched me the most, because her comments on the concept of morality put the finger right on the wound for me.  Morality, a topic that made her friends (and mine) cringe, but that was at the very core of her problems.  My third favorite essay is Anne Roiphe's, a revision of a divorce that never was but that should have been (her own parents').  All in all, this is a fantastic collection that helped me immensely, and that i will always cherish as one of the greatest books of essays i've ever read.	2000-12-07

There's something missing to the story.  Maybe it is the fact that the dramatic element is not there (after all, this is a transcript of conversations that the author had with one of the men).  The result is that this reads more like a dry account of what happened, instead of the thriller i was expecting.<br />In any event, it is amazing that these poor men were able to withstand the terrible conditions of their ordeal and live to tell.  I was disappointed that only the officer received the medal, while the sailors simply got commendations.  Well, the officer is the one who got them lost in the first place!<br />This would be a good book for a teenager, because it reads extremely fast (at a good pace, maybe 2 hours), and it tells a story of extreme adversity and resourcefulness, and there's many youngsters out there that could take heed.	2000-12-05

That takes some skill!<br />The older you get, the more assertive you become, the more you know what to say or how to behave yourself in a tough situation.  Right?  Not really, if one is to look at Anna.  She is just as insecure at 72 as she was in her youth.  If one is to hope for invaluable wisdom as a payoff for lack of energy, strength, health, looks, etc., we are all screwed.  This was my secret hope, and i am now very disappointed.  Anna has been feeling weak as long as she can remember, first with her mother, then with her husband and his family, now with her daughters and even her granddaughter.  What i find most pathetic is her inability to resolve her resentments towards her husband when she should have.  She did not deal with whatever he did to her at its right time, and now that he is sick and almost an invalid is not the time to bring things up, yet Anna can't help herself.  As a character, she infuriates me.  If you don't do the right thing at the right time (in this case, deal with your husband), then let it go.  Don't store it up and let it fester for decades.  The rest of the family is sad and well portrayed.  Ike is a sick man angry at the world for whatever obscure reason.  Helen is pretentious.  Claire is envious.  Susanna is on the same path Anna is right now.  Christine is the perfect example of why marriage and reproduction should not be allowed for anyone under 30.  What's with her sense of entitlement and arrogance?  At one point, her own mother calls her a 'dope'.  Well put!<br />My two objections are Dolores, who is referred to time and time again and is never developed as a character (by comparison, Abel is very well described and understood), and Christine's final decision.  It doesn't make sense, after spending half the book defending her arguments to now change her mind so quickly.<br />In this novel, which takes place in 36 hours, we get to know a family with generational problems and character problems.  The imperfections of these characters make them real, and although none of them is lovable, they form a beautiful book.  The detail and thoroughness that Jane Smiley goes through is remarkable.family with generational problems and character problems.

It deals with many different small-town prejudices, and the outrage at the 11 year-old level that little Georgeann feels.  My favorite story, from a humor standpoint, is Blueprints.  Although it is not a funny story per se, the comments and thoughts that Lydia makes about Whitman's friends are hilarious.  These friends are so concerned about Mother Nature and the environment, but haven't bothered to visit them once they moved out of the evil city into the foothills.  These same friends insist that fertilized eggs are better for you than unfertilized eggs (show me the scientific evidence), and name their children after vegetables.  I am sure these guys look at you wrong if you don't buy organic coffee beans from Guatemala.  I think Barbara Kingsolver has little tolerance for those nature-type-wanna-be's (here, here).<br />All these and the rest of the stories are beautifully crafted, with many reflections on nature.  Wonderful book, not to be missed.	2000-11-20

In pursuit of the bad guys, she goes up and down Barcelona and its beautiful monuments.<br />The plot is thinnish and i HATED the ending (don't worry, i won't reveal it... but i found it very frustrating).

He explained how one day he went to the Post Office to pick up his mail, and he noticed a woman retrieving letters from her box, close to him.  Her letters were exotic-looking, air-mail envelopes, artsy, beautiful stamps.  He looked at his own mail, bills and grocery ads, and felt envious.  He then decided to write this book.<br />This entire collection is a joy for the eyes.  The layout is fascinating:  the envelopes and postcards are an innovative idea, that i haven't seen anywhere else.  The illustrations are wonderful.  I don't know that the story plot is all that great.  If you remove the colorful layout, the story is OK, but nothing to write home about (there is an audio version of this book.  Those that have listened to it could say).  However, this would be an excellent present for a teenager.  I know i would have been all over this book (the entire trilogy) at fourteen.

Except for this one.  This book was a terrible disappointment.  I really wanted to like it.  There's a photo of Dorothy West on the back cover, and she looks like such a nice old lady.  But none of that helped me like the book any better.<br />The story takes place in The Oval, a very exclusive area of Martha's Vineyard.  The only people who live in The Oval are high-class blacks.<br />There are all kinds of possible marriages and unions in this novel:  white to white, black to black, white to black, fair-colored to black, fair-colored to white, fair-colored to fair-colored.  For 240 pages, half of the characters agonize as to whether they did the right thing choosing their mates, or did they succumb to social imperatives.  The other half spends those 240 pages justifying why they did what they did.<br />Gram is a stereotypical Old South lady who has a change of heart on page 240...  Lute is the most puzzling character of all.  He marries three white women in a row, has a daughter with each one of them, is a loving father but an abusive husband, and gets his mind set on marrying the fair-colored heiress of the most coveted property in the Oval, because he wants his daughters to have a mother and vacation every summer in that idyllic community.<br />Hmmm...<br />The message that the author tries to deliver is that love is always above race and social pressure.  This is a very true message, that unfortunately gets lost in the muddy dialogs and descriptions.  The delivery of such a powerful statement is reduced to a sentence towards the end of the book.<br />The ending is so ironic that it makes you sorry for the author.  Probably her first novels are much better than this one, so leave this one for last, not like me, who haven't read anything by Ms. West until this one.	2000-10-21

The first one, which titles the book, is almost a novella, very well crafted.  With a murder at the center of the story, you read about how this death has affected different characters, and their take on it.  My second favorite story is My Mother's Dream, a very vivid account of family dynamics at a time of loss and happiness.<br />Each one of these stories left me satisfied, with a sense of completion, and that is something i often miss when reading short stories.

Its best value is the fact that it provides a very different point of view when it comes to prosperity.  It also proves how important it is to educate children in financial issues from a very early age.  This is a valuable book if you are trying to learn more about personal finance.  I don't like the self-promotion of CashFlow Technologies throughout the book, and i think there are cheaper ways to learn about your finances than by buying an expensive game, but overall the book is interesting, reads quickly and more importantly, gives you a different way to look at money.	2000-10-21

However, i did find that some of the men very willing to be manipulated (the case of Leander and his first marriage, and Coverly and his cover-girl bride).<br />Leander's account of his first marriage is sad and touching, and the contrast with the disgruntled woman who comes to ask for explanations makes her look even more ugly.

Here you have Leroy, whose life is disintegrating in front of his eyes, or Sam, who looks back at his long life not understanding how some things happened, or Nancy, wondering how she ended up so far away from home.

I was at the library, looking for a book-on-tape for my long commute, and  the selection was meager, so i decided to make this a first.  Never before  had i read anything by Danielle Steel.  Now i can see why serious readers  don't waste their time with this author.  The word &quot;stereotype&quot;  is an understatement.<br />Here we have two glamorous, absolutely gorgeous,  brilliant people, who even after 14 years of marriage are still passionate  for each other like they were on day 1.  They both drone on and on and on  about how much they love each other, but judging for the amount of hours  they spent at work, their love sounds fake and phony.  But wait!, they also  complain about the long hours they have to work.  I felt like slapping them  on the head.  Work and shut up, or reduce your hours and spend time with  the person you are so crazy about.  Danielle Steel spends precious time  trying to justify their hectic schedules, and after a while her  justifications sound empty.<br />On top of all this, the husband is dying to  have children.  Ha!  They barely see each other once every ten days, and he  is thinking it is a good idea to bring children into this world.  And he  went to medical school!  At this point i started to question his  intelligence.<br />The wife is scary.  In one scene, she is at home, bored  out of her brains, after not having been there for weeks!  Didn't she have  any bills to pay, laundry to fold, friends to phone, books to read, plants  to water?  She decides to take an early flight to her next business  destination because she has nothing to do at home.  What a one-dimensional  character!  People like this (they do exist) i avoid like the plague.  In  literature, they bring nothing to the book.<br />The wife, an investment  banker, encounters some opposition from the CFO of a company she is taking  public.  There is a scene where the CFO calls her a bimbo, in front of his  boss.  Mind you, there was no alcohol involved.  Realistically, how many  times does this happen in life?<br />And on the excuse of the wife being  into finance, the words &quot;red herring&quot; and &quot;green shoe&quot;  are peppered at will throughout the book, just to show that Danielle Steel  did her homework.<br />After tape 2, i had enough.  I'm not going to finish  it, but i bet this is what happens:<br />1) The wife has been spending so much  time with the guy whose company she is taking public that she drops her  defenses and starts questioning her marriage and all about it.<br />2) The  husband is tired of waiting for his wife to come home, so he goes to Paris  and surprises her there.<br />3) The husband gets unbelievably jealous and  furious, and after a dramatic scene takes the next flight back to NY.<br />4) The wife realizes she truly loves her husband, and she can't  jeopardize her marriage.  She flies back to NY, and runs to the hospital to  find him.  Hugs and kisses and passionate lovemaking, and more trite  dialog, bla, bla, bla...<br />5) After this reconciliation, the wife decides  she REALLY wants to have children after all, so she foregoes her career and  gets pregnant.

Elizabeth and Ruth are  cousins, and Elizabeth gets adopted by Ruth's parents when her own parents  are killed.  The girls grow up as sisters, but all along Ruth develops an  incredible ill for Elizabeth, even though she doesn't do anything to  provoke that resentment.  Ruth makes it her life's mission to destroy  Elizabeth.  Her dream is to see her in pain, suffering and humiliated.  She  resorts to extreme manipulations and convoluted schemes to achieve that  purpose.<br />Ruth is an amazing character, who personifies badness in a  thought-provoking way.  Her selfishness, envy and greed are almost  incomprehensible.  How can a human being harbor such hate for someone who  has never done anything wrong?  This novel made me think and think about  the issue.  Is it possible that people are born bad?  So many times i've  heard that we are all born good, and it's circumstances that make us bad.  Did Ruth turn bad when she saw her parents combing Elizabeth's hair?  Was  that the moment when Ruth became jealous of her cousin?  What happened in  subsequent years, how did that badness grow?<br />Almost as amazing are  Elizabeth's reactions to her sister's attacks.  As evil as Ruth is, so is  Elizabeth gracious and forgiving.  Elizabeth summarizes her philosophy of  life during their final meeting, a cathartic episode for Ruth, who is  deeply changed after that.<br />A fascinating, disturbing novel that i  highly recommend.	2000-09-15

She can gather  idiosyncrasies, cultures, ethnicities, languages, philosophies, and  interweave them in a story with no seams.  And it works!  A common flaw  that I find in contemporary novels is that sometimes the author brings in  situations or characters, deals with them for one and a half pages, and  never brings them back for the rest of the book.  BK develops characters  and plots deeply, and does readers like me a big favor by not leaving us  with more questions than it is necessary.<br />This is a beautiful book, and  a good introduction to the works of BK.  I enjoy the presence of nature  throughout the pages (BK has a background in Biology/Botany, and nature is  a common focus point in her books).  She is also very concerned about those  less fortunate than us, and makes her point clear with the characters of  Esteban and Esperanza, the Guatemalan refugees.<br />The sequel to this  book, Pigs in Heaven, is my least favorite of her books, and I found it  miles away from this one.	2000-07-07

The book ends on a happy, hopeful note, and that's her best revenge.<br />I  have to agree with other readers that this is not her best work (my  favorite novel is The Anna Papers), but as a whole I think she is a superb  writer.  Her characters are exuberant, amoral and make no apologies, and  this novel was no exception.  I enjoy the common points in her writing, the  alcoholism, the atypical motherhood feelings, the weight problems, and the  detailed descriptions of clothing and decoration.  If you are new to  Gilchrist, maybe you should try something else first.  In any case, this  was a worthy novel and I wouldn't pass it up.	2000-05-30
US	52987300	RBBCWMLK2YPUA	0345387651	394884897	The Cider House Rules	Books	5	4	6	N	N	how can he write so well!	This is in my top ten books of all times.  What a sweet, sad, moving, terrific novel.  I love everything i've read by John Irving so far.  The man can write.  The characters are beautiful, real, and well drawn.  The  depth of the novel, the subplots, the descriptions, make the book thick and  at the same time rich and satisfying.  The talent it takes to craft such a  story!  (but, as Irving himself says, &quot;Talent is  overrated&quot;).<br />The movie is good, but i agree with other reviewers:  it makes sense to see the movie first, read the book second.  You can't  possibly expect 600 pages of accuracy condensed in 2 hours.<br />Both the  book and the movie left me with the belief that any given question has more  than one right answer.  I am maybe a bit less judgemental because of  Irving.  And that's no small potatoes	2000-05-24

There was, in my opinion, too much focus on doubt,  second-thoughts, and the ugly side of weddings (relatives, money, etc).  That was not the case with all pieces, but the irony or the sadness carried  over and took away some of the freshness.	2000-05-23

I thoroughly enjoyed it, because it gave me some insight on addiction that i  did not have before. Sen. McGovern's intentions in writing this book are  laudable, and i have a lot of respect for him.  I can only imagine how  painful it must have been to research the material (Terry's journals,  social workers' reports, etc), and to actually write the book and go  through those memories.  He is sincere and acknowledges his responsibility  as a father, and does not try to place blame on alcohol, society, or many  of the other targets of anti-abuse groups.  Terry might as well have been  born with CF, because she suffered from (in her case) an incurable disease.  If you want to understand the incredible power of addiction, this book is  a great place to start.	2000-05-22

I read this book for the first time when i took undergraduate biochemistry in college.  I could not put it down.  Now, ten years later, i found it at a second-hand store and re-read it, and once again read it in two sittings.  This book reads like a thriller.  You definitively  catch a sense of the  urgency of their research.  I was flipping pages nervously, like i didn't  know Watson and Crick were the ones who won the race.<br />In the edition i  have, Watson is very thankful about the contributions that Rosalind  Franklin made to their discovery.  He is crystal clear about how she was  the one convinced that the backbone was on the outside, and had not he  followed her advice, it would have taken him even longer to figure out the  structure, and who knows?, Pauling might have gotten there first.  In the  epilogue, Watson is all praise about Rosalind, acknowledges how his  opinions about her were often wrong, how excellent the quality of her work  was, and ponders about the obstacles that she encountered in her career in  science for being a woman.<br />I wonder if these comments were missing in  other people's books, because according to their critiques, one comes out  with the idea that Watson and the male-dominated scientific establishment  gave Rosalind the cancer that killed her.<br />This is an excellent, honest  account of an event that took place when the author was 25 years old.  I  could not believe my eyes when i read that sentence.  Twenty-five, worrying  about girls and tennis and the structure of the most important molecule in  the universe.  These facts might count for something.  This is a must-read  book, for everybody, whether you understand science or not.	2000-05-14

I did not understand the manipulation that Avrum exerted on Bobo, i did not understand the relationship between Bobo, Amy and Carter (some 38  years later they are still as friendly as ever), and i certainly did not  understand how Bobo could have changed his mind at the very end of the  story after hearing &quot;The Shadow Song&quot;.  This book tries too hard  to be lyric and inspired, and fails in the reality check department.  I  think it falls right there with another fantasy work, _The Bridges of  Madison County_.<br />I haven't read anything else by this author, but this  book was a waste of my time.

WRESTLING!  Why would i want that?  Well, John Irving did a supert job piquing my curiousity.  It takes some skill to make  the reader interested in something that they had not ever considered.<br />The  part where John Irving talks about his sons made me admire him so much.  He  truly loves his children and has such a beautiful way to express it.  This  autobiography is my favorite part of the book.<br />The short stories are OK,  but they can't match the quality of the autobiography.

Maybe it's the surrealism that pervades the whole story.  Rosa Montero does have a knack  depicting decaying urban landscapes.

Some have been accurate in their depictions, but i find that i read a lot about love and don't quite connect with the emotions  or with the characters.  With this book, Laurie Colwin wiped me off my  feet.  I can totally put myself in the shoes of Jane Louise, who wants  desperately to make everything OK for her husband, who cannot understand  how someone so lovely could have been treated badly by others, who gets  outraged at the thought that her beloved suffered at some point in his  life.  This is one of the key corners of love, and i have yet to find other  authors that put their finger right there.  This was an awesome love story.  I watched a movie on PBS called &quot;Ask me Again&quot; some 12 years  ago, and i have not been able to forget it.  What do you know?  Laurie  Colwin wrote the script.

This is fantasy fiction, so comments like &quot;this book is too far-fetched&quot; are out of place.  The novel made me reflect on how dependent we are of modern-day conveniences, and how a huge catastrophe would wipe out all of those things in given time.  I enjoyed the sisters'  resorcefulness, and felt truly bad at every disaster they encountered, but  was very put off when they became intimate.  One of the editorial reviews  mentions that this book would appeal to teenagers...Hmmm...That's a bad  call.  I wouldn't want a 14yr old reading through the lesbian scenes...<br />Anyhow, i think this book is very valuable in that it makes you think  about what would happen if we had to do like our ancestors, live off the  earth and make do with what mother nature provided.  Until i read the book,  i had never stopped to reflect on that.  Had you?	2000-02-12

The author has a  simple style, very lyric, and her observations are smart and plain, no  artifice.  I totally disagree with the comment of another customer about  the writing being contrite.

Her accounts and  descriptions might be simple, of everyday tasks that we don't think much  about, but i really enjoyed learning about these details.<br />The book i  read, the &quot;Illustrated&quot; version, is an abrigment of the thre  volumes.

There are times when we look for something light and inconsequential for a read.  Even though we might subscribe to National  Geographic at home, we might feel like reading People at the doctor's  office.  This book is trite and simple, but sometimes this is what the  reader wants.  If you need something of more substance, pick John Updike or  Joyce Carol Oates.  Sure Bridget is self-pitying and has no  &quot;real&quot; problems in her life, but at one point or another we might  have felt this way too, sorry for ourselves because there is nothing too  serious going on (disease, death, poverty, ethical issues, etc).  So what?  (BTW, the AllyMcBeal comment is right on).<br />Anyhow, apart from the  character of the mother, which is way too cartoonish, the book is OK.

US	52987300	R1OD49GXHEMXXU	0060928263	311972687	America's Dream	Books	4	6	6	N	N	perfect book for a discussion group	I applaud the author's decision of not taking the easy way out with this novel.  The main character, America, is a battered woman.  The father of her child has been beating her constantly for half of her life.  She has known nothing but violence from this man.  In addition to this, America has to deal with a rebellious spoiled daughter and an alcoholic mother.  Even thought America reaches for strength inside herself and flees the country and her lover and even her family, she does not have the guts to pull the situation through.  Overwhelmed by her independence, and ultimately by her own insecurities, she seriously considers going back to the same old torture she escaped.  And here is where i see most merit:  it would have been so easy for Esmeralda Santiago to portray America as a heroine who fought against oppression and violence and came out victorious.  America surrendered, and this is a very real perspective on battered women, because unfortunately there are many that give up on hope and cannot escape the terror they have lived.  Kudos to the author for her decision.  After i read the book i kept thinking about different issues in the story, and this is why i think this book would be excellent for a group discussion.  Another good topic is the relationship between America and her daughter, and on a broader perspective the perpetuation of the single-mother status in her family.  America asks herself this question many times :  what should have i done to prevent this from happening to my daughter?  The dynamics between mother and daughter are very real.  All the characters are extremely believable and very well-defined:  the abusive husband, a charming manipulator that gave me the creeps more than once; America's employer in NY, so cold, so Anglo, so perfect; the culture shock episodes America goes through have a very familiar ring.  The book becomes sluggish at times, but over all it is quite interesting.	1997-11-24

Isabel Allende has this uncanny ability to make some words jump out of the page and grab you, words that you thought you had forgotten, that bring you back to childhood, or remind you of an old neighbor.  I read some of the reader comments before posting this, and someone said this book makes you laugh, then five minutes later makes you cry.  I couldn't agree more.  I enjoyed it also because i saw how much autobiographical insight is in _The House of the Spirits_.  One more thing to mention:  the description she makes of her uncle Salvador Allende must be one of the best portraits in writing i have ever seen.	1997-11-14

She does a great, amusing job describing her search.  I did not like the ending all that much (too predictable).  On another note, i am sure few are going to go to the store and buy a book on canning, yet this book has perfectly good recipes that one can follow.  Canning, a lost art, now recovered thanks to DB	1997-11-06

Spence and Lila are old and worn, but the love they have for each other is still pure and fresh, forty plus years after their marriage.  That a love like this might exist, and the characters are so real that it is likely, gives me new hopes in life	1997-08-10

But it seemed so real that i longed to visit it.  Kingsolver's style reminded me of such authors as Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Isabel Allende, who use a lot of imagery and colorful descriptions.  I cried, i laughed.  Beautiful book!	1997-05-02

I love the parallel drawn with the plane rides, how in one case it is a beautiful woman running away from responsibility, and on the other it is a not-so-graceful woman running away from scorn.  I first learned of Erdrich in some anthology, where i read her short story _Fleur_ (now, that's a scary character!	1997-05-02

Awesome awesome narrative; it is terrible that Dorris will not write again.  Memorable book with a surprising ending.	1997-05-02

What i liked best about _Love Medicine_ was the way the characters were portrayed: so very real. Other authors, when dealing with Native American culture, fall short on their attempts to integrate their characters' spirituality with daily life in a believable manner.<br /><br />Some advice: I read _The Beet Queen_ first, and i liked it better that way.	1997-05-01
