Even though it didn't get as glowing reviews, I still bought it.  Glad I did.  Look, I haven't read any of her other books, but I will be looking and buying them on the strength of this book, it WAS that good.  This lady has her own special finesse on the romance genre, I absolutely recommend this author so highly.	2005-08-10

I agree with the previous reviewer who said it kind of felt rushed, that was the feeling I had also.  But, to be fair, there were certain key elements he brought to the table with The Demonologist.  The essential creepy buildup, some of the scenes were rendered quite effectively, and I was up quite a few hours reading them.  Not the best book I've read, but I like his style so I'd read another by him definitely.	2005-07-08

I had this book for a while and finally got around to reading it, and once started, could not put down.  Basically to give a synapsis of the story, it's about a man on the verge of divorce, a true crime journalist, who is going through what appears to be a slow and hallucination filled mental breakdown.  He's a likable fellow, but with some dark undertones to his personality that he cannot get a grip on at times.  This is written deftly and while the subject matter is quite intense, Mr. Waggoner makes the man likable anyway.  The cover of the book is absolutely stunning.  Scary, seductive, horrifying, you will not want to put it down.  High recommend.	2005-06-28

They are well written and everything but I wish there was a little more buildup to where her characters become involved.  You get a chapter or two into her stories and pretty soon theres this marathon sex going on, over and over every chapter.  Theres no innocence or buildup involved, just a short period at the beginning and then its like they've done it and redone it and there you have it.  My advice would be keep your great characters, just carry them along a little more because it gives the reader more to look foward to.	2005-02-18

This book was so beautifully written I was amazed that Gaelen Foley is new.  She really knows how to write.  This book read like a modern Romeo  and Juliet at times.

This book took one of the meanest, low down dogs of a man I have ever read and he had a serious  accident in which he comes back totally changed and the husband his wife  always wanted him to be.  I disagree with the reviewers that said they felt  the wife was so weak, etc.  I view anyone who can withstand what she went  through and still be civil and decent as a very strong person.  The book  did a total turnaround when it asked the question, what happens when this  pig of a guy suddenly and irreversibly changes his ways and goes about  every way he can to rectify the damage he caused and own up to it.  Implausible, perhaps, but it made for an interesting and unique read.	2000-06-29

He is majorly sidetracked, however, when he meets Vanessa, the sister of the unfortunate young man he was  preparing to kill. Damian decides to put his considerable charms to test to  see if he can manipulate Vanessa into being his mistress rather than him  killing her brother.  Loyal sister that she is, she agrees, and is slowly  drawn deeper into Damian's seduction.  What unfolds is one of the  steamiest, best written books I've read in a while.  Do yourself a favor  and read this book!	2000-05-19

Then, years later, they meet and he hires her to be his  bodyguard.  Someone does a person like this and they expect to trust them  to guard their life!   Not to mention the guy kept calling her Blondie  really annoyed me a lot.  I mean she does have a name.  She was annoying  too.  Of course the sparks started flying and they made it several times,  in vast detail, but it was very empty and unloving and unsexy.  After every  time she was like 'don't tell me you love me' blah blah and by the time it  finally got real, it felt forced.  I like slow buildup and true tension and  chemistry and this book, in my opinion had neither.	2000-05-08
