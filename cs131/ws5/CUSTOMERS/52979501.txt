With her clean, economical prose she cuts right through the arrogance of the wealthy and the submissiveness of the poor. Fifteen year old Theresa is unlike anyone I have ever encountered in fiction but have known in real life. Thoughtful, kind, and confident, she marches through Long Island, ministering to the neglected children of the rich. When her eight year old cousin Daisy comes to spend a few weeks with Theresa's family, Theresa recognizes how much in need of repair Daisy is. Physically but also emotionally, for Daisy is one of many children of a poor family and has been not abused so much as over looked. Theresa's own family seems to emotionally neglect her too, so caring for Daisy is, in a way, also caring for Theresa. They have a strong bond and Theresa creates a lovely summer for her. The thoughtless and careless ways of the rich are balanced by the thoughtless, careless, ways of the poor. Reading Child of My heart is like reading a primer in how to behave. Do yourself a favor and read this wonderful book. Thanks goodness for Alice McDermott!	2002-11-15

As a fan of SNL I enjoyed each moment. I particularly enjoyed discovering that some whom I thought to be jerks turned out to be very likeable...of course the opposite also applies. To those who say SNL is \\"not as good as it used to be\\" I say it is so much better than it used to be.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the originals and the  Crystal, Guest, Short and  Shearer years were fabulous, but Farley and Murphy and Gross and MacDonald and Sanz and Meadows and Ferrell and Morgan and Kataan and Fey and Fallon and Dratch are also great.  It has big problems of course, too many hosts whose movie is opening that week, and characters repeated too often, but on the whole, it's always exciting and funny. I only wish that 'Live From New York' included more cast members.	2002-10-26

His spare, elegant, prose has a way of elevating us ... we humans. He has taken us on journeys from the clear lakes of Minnesota to the decaying streams of Vietnam, and on to the ivy covered walls of academia...and through all these stories he has done what all great novelists do, opened our hearts and souls to humanity. He has made us look at ourselves. That mirror he holds up to us is harsh but truthful. We must look, painful as it is, to see the truth and uncover the beauty.<br />And so now he takes us to the thirtieth reunion of the class of 1969. That amazing year that took us to the moon and then flung us into the mud of Vietnam. \\"Sex, drugs and rock and roll\\" was the mantra of that year, and in July, July we see the aftermath of those words. The individuals in this novel are the patsys, the fall guys, the dupes of that era. \\"Never trust anyone over thirty,\\" \\"Hell no, we won't go,\\" and my all time favorite, \\"Free Love.\\" Except that we found out that nothing is free and you do definitely get what you pay for. For the class of '69, it is cancer, nightmares, alcohol, and very little peace. And always there is Johnny Ever, the voice of the middle ages crazies. The class of '69 scorned tradition, scoffed at spirituality, put themselves into the hands of astrologers, but forty years on, they're looking for God in all the wrong places. I was touched by Spook and Johnny and Marv and Jan, all of the people who fill this book. I cringed at Karen Burns and her hellish trip to Tuscon and cried at Dorothy's topless adventure.<br />To read Tim O'Brien is to uncover the essence, the pith, the soul of man. We'll all be better for it.	2002-10-09

Robert Parker's latest hero, Jesse Stone, is a human being first and Sherrif second. With all his faults you have to love him...or at least admire him.

Whether she is writing as Barbara Vine or Ruth Rendell she is always tops. Grasshopper is no exception . Murder, mayhem, psychologically damaged people, interior monologues, taut writing and marvelous plotting keep the reader in her thrall. This time phobias are at the heart and having a couple myself added to the excitement.  Always a pleasure!	2000-10-26

This book is a treat. Powell has created a woman  who is smart AND funny. I had to read her lists several times in order to implant them in my brain forever. You will too. I loved Edisto and consider it one of the best books of the past fifty years, so naturally I bought  Mrs Hollingsworth's Men immediately. It is funny and romantic and altogether wonderful. Mrs Hollingsworth is a delight . I think you'll like her too.	2000-10-26

I had the same feelings reading the Diagnosis that I had reading Alice in Wonderland...wonderful, scary, funny, improbabale...but at the same time totally possible. Bill Chalmers gets on the commuter train in Boston and soon finds he doesn't know his destination or the seventh digit of his phone number. Horrible things happen as he falls down his rabbit hole. I was swept up in this novel and kept thinking about how fried my own brain becomes from information overload, and trying to do too many things at once. Bill's son's addiction to the internet is something I see in me and most of my friends. Alan Lightman is a Kafka for 2000.  When you finish reading the Diagnosis, and you should read the Diagnosis, read or re-read, Thoreau...we all need to relax.	2000-09-22

This is a tender and poignant story of love, death,  family, and high society. All familys have secrets and family members often  turn a blind eye to them. This story is a rich study of family and of the  time it takes place. In beautiful language, Margaret Atwood takes the  reader on a twisting, dangerous road full of hairpin curves and sudden  obstacles. I loved the cliches of the '30's and the insights into high  society. A complicated, dense novel that packs and emotional wallop.	2000-09-12

Rhoda Strong (and what an appropriate name that is!) is the heroine of  this fictional memoir.  Rhoda is a native American living in a Native  American settlement in North Carolina as the civil war is winding down. As  a young woman in 'Scuffletown' she watches as her brothers join a gang    headed by Henry Lowrie. Much to her surprise and her family's horror, she  falls in love with Henry. This story of white against red,  North against  South, and woman against man is terrific. This is a quietly affecting  novel. It is moody and its pace is slow and unhurried. A woman whose  strength and fortitude are a tribute to our ancestors whether white, red or  brown.	2000-09-04

Man oh man, Dave Robicheaux is one stylin' guy. Dave deals with the villian of all villians, Zipper Clum, helps Letty Labiche and Mae Guillory  and along the way meets, Bootsie, Belmont and Batist. New Iberia is the  town for me! Dave's a wonderful character. Moral, upright and determined.  The other characters he meets along the way are all memorable as well. This  is a really enjoyable book. My only regret...Dave is fictional.	2000-08-27

This novel is like New Orleans itself;  gorgeous and fun loving on the outside, steamy, sexy, and decaying on the  inside. Poor Sonny LaMott!  He has the bad luck to fall in love with  Juliet, a person of almost no morals and no interest in  anything but  herself and her own pleasure.  Like 'Tupelo Nights,' 'My Juliet' is a  terrific read. It is a dark and twisted woman  who leads us down a dark and  twisted path. A path that is ultimately satisfying because the writing is  so wonderful, the characters unforgettable, and the story so seductive.	2000-08-19

The beauty of the language and the depth of the love story set against the hideous ugliness of Idi  Amin's reign is a marvel. The story is sensual and erotic, the prose so  lovely that you feel Africa. The heat, the mosquitoes, the sultry evenings.  A  lyrical novel that's a delight to read.	2000-08-05

Allison Avery is the perfect 'girl.' Beloved by  friends and family. Her murder opens up her life... a secret life that may  have led to her brutal murder. Olivia Dale is a young reporter who covers  the story for her Memphis newspaper. Olivia bears a resemblance to Allison  and soon the murdered girl's family and friends open up to her, giving her  insight into Allisons life. Olivia is drawn into this shadowy and dangerous  world, fascinated by the wild side hidden inside her.  Leah Stewart is a  wonderful writer . I never thought anyone could hold a candle to Ruth  Rendell, but here she is! This book is what a crime novel should  be...literate, insightful and most importantly, great fun to read. I look  forward to the next book!	2000-08-03

It is used strictly as a location in which to place self-involved, snobby caricatures. The &quot;earnest poor boy orphan,&quot; the &quot;loud  mouthed sports team owner,&quot; the &quot;rich white girl in love with a  black man.&quot; Wow!  This muddled novel of cliched characters, annoying  changes in tense and irritating style drove me nuts. If you want a book  with no real narrative, no real characters and slovenly style, this one's  for you.	2000-07-31

'Jim,the Boy' evokes emotions and  captures the everyday drama  of one ten year old boy. A boy with no  father but three terrific uncles. A  boy with love in him and around him.'Jim, the Boy' is a wonderful,  thoughtful and beautifully written  novel. It is for all readers with  hearts.	2000-07-07

Crais writes Carol Starkey so well you will feel her pain, physical and emotional. She hurts so much it breaks your heart. I like this ATF agent Pell also. As a  longtime Angeleno I really enjoy his relistic settings. The race to find  &quot;Mr. Red&quot; and the reality of the bomb squad will keep you up all  night - first by reading, then by dreaming! A great thriller.	2000-06-25

I really tried to like this latest book of John Sandford...however, I began reading it on a Friday and on the following Wednesday I was still slogging through it. This is a bad sign. Usually I finish a Lucas Davenport  novel in one day! I was very disappointed. I did finish it, so there is  that! But it just wasn't what Sandford is capable of.	2000-06-16

I have all his books, 'Weekends,' 'Desserts,' 'Cooking For Friends,' etc. and I use them almost exclusively. This book is quite comprehensive and includes a few recipes from his other books.  From  the highly original 'Scrambled Egg Salad' to the simple 'Tomato Aspic' to  the marvelous 'Veal chops with Blackberries' to the divine 'Natchez lemon  Cake' you won't regret buying this cookbook. The recipes are laid out in a  simple, straight forward style. Lots of cookbooks promise fabulous dishes.  This one actually delivers it.	2000-06-08

Savagely satirical, blurring the line between reality and fantasy, fact and fiction, Westlake delivers a one/two punch. A knock out of a book. Having read everything by Westlake and his  nom de plume Richard Stark, I would put this near the top. This is more in  keeping with &quot;The Ax&quot; from a few years ago than with &quot;Help  I'm Being Held Prisoner!&quot; or any of his other comic novels. A terrific  read.	2000-03-26

He doesn't diasappoint this time out even though this isn't a story with Harry Bosch. Seeing this story through the eyes of the criminal was interesting and fun. Cassie Black, Vegas, and a void moon, all add up  to thrills and chills. Great fun.	2000-03-11

Dave Eggers has learned that to be a man you must act like one. Wearing the outward appearance of the hip  gen xer, Dave Eggers does battle against the outsiders who would make him  pitiful. He cares for his brother and fears for him.  Dave Eggers is kind,  generous, and loving. He's also selfish, rude, and paranoid. In other  words, Dave Eggers is human. This gifted writer bares his soul and mind to  us. I love Dave Eggers and I thank him for showing how to overcome  heartbreaking adversity by being a real, genuine, and courageous person.	2000-03-11
