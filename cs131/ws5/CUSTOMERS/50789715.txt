Finally, someone is offering something new. <br />I like the tip format -- I don't have time to read 600 pages in a weekend. The format made using solutions I found easy. <br />The book does a good job with ASP and PHP ... I wished it would have presented Perl too.<br />The Javascript and CSS stuff is good -- the examples are actually usable in real-world web pages.	2002-02-17

PHP even makes more sense now ... but I am going to stick with ASP.<br />I am not using ASP.NET yet, so I can't comment on that part of the book.<br />The ASP material is very good and very easy.	2002-02-17

The explanation makes the scripts easy to use (though I'm not sure yet how they work)<br />There are some Java programs I will try next that the book says I can customize. <br />The CSS discussion is good. Wish they had discussed XML.	2002-02-15

Pretty easy process.<br />I'm finding the performance tips the most valuable. Not just stuff on caching ... but ways to improve PHP, JavaScript, and CSS performance. <br />I wish the book covered more Perl.	2002-02-11

Covers the techniques designers must know to create a secure fast Web site. <br />The discussion of CSS is straight forward and the tricks are clever and valuable. <br />I don't program, but I was able to cut and paste the Javascript examples into my HTML pages and they worked.<br />I was able to get a secure site running over the weekend for free! (I'll have to buy a certificate in 2 months), but it's working now. Instructions were easy to follow.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2002-02-07

I had been struggling with trying to understand the differences between PCI, VESA, IDE, SCSI and firewire ... when to use which for what ... how to use each.<br />The book's bus chapter is worth the price of the book alone! Not only do I now know what each bus does, how to tell if my PC has the bus, I also know how the buses communicate with one another.<br />According to the book and the benchmarks I ran after reading the book, incorrect bus use can severely impact performance. Fortunately, fixing the bus problems is easy.	2002-02-06

Discussion on Events and Delegates	Have been through a myriad of .NET books and could not find a good discussion of delegates and how to use them.

The book promises you can complete each of its 30+ lessons in 10 to 15 minute sessions ...<br />I may be a slow typist -- I think I probably spent 30 minutes with most lessons -- but then, I experimented some.<br />Book is very easy to follow. I had not programmed before ... didn't own a compiler (there is one on the CD -- so I have still never bought one ...) <br />I was did great with the basics. I am still working through the inheritance and polymorphism (which I didn't know was a word ... which may add to my lesson time). I will get there -- I start with the code on the CD-ROM -- normally experiment enough to make things stop working -- but the book normally gets me back on track. <br />Wish this guy had a book on Visual Basic.	2002-02-01

It is very, very easy to use. Got me up and running with both MS SQL and MySQL (which I downloaded for free).
