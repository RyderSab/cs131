They are in themselves almost completely unbelievable.  But Ms. Dunant has managed to weave these fantastic elements into a story that makes you believe it all and feel for the characters deeply. <br /> <br />We meet Alessandra as a young girl.  She is willful and extremely well educated.  She wants to paint above all things, but that is just not totally acceptable for young women.  When the city of Florence is about to come under the grip of Savonarola her parents want to send her to a convent, she pleads to marry so that she may stay in the city that she loves.  The resulting arranged marriage is the first on many over-the-top plot twists that draw you into the story.   <br /> <br />We follow Alessandra and Florence through the trials that are but on the city and it's citizenry that seem to be a portent for all those who would let the religious zealot rule.  We follow Alessandra through her bizarre \\"marriage of convenience\\", cry with her when she finds her true love, and watch as she matures to a woman who finally finds peace with herself and her life. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

US	49872352	R1EE2ERMI888KY	0060563486	598431249	Ireland: A Novel	Books	2	17	34	N	N	Boring and poorly crafted	After having read some of the other reviews, I have come to the conclusion that you either love this book or find it boring.  I must add my voice to the minority who just doesn't find this book to be quite so marvelous. <br /> <br />The novel centers on a young man as he grows up, his mother and father, his aunt, and an elderly storyteller.  The young man becomes obsessed with the storyteller and attempts to find him.  In the process of his search, the novel is laced with the stories of the storyteller, sometime told in his own voice, sometimes told by others, and sometime written. <br /> <br />The problem I had with the novel was that the plot itself was just riddled with plot turns that are best described as worthy of a soap opera.  We learn why the aunt is just so abnormally close, we learn why the mother seems to hate the storyteller, and we learn why the young man is drawn to the old storyteller.  The answer to all these questions is just so overdramatic that they are not even believable.  It's impossible to believe that one family could have this many skeletons in the closet.  They certainly would get dysfunctional family of the year in my book. <br /> <br />And the stories themselves are so contrived.  Imagine that all the stories that are recounted to our young man just happen to fall in chronological order!!  Just what are the chances of that happening over a 10 or so year period?  I would think pretty slim. <br /> <br />I'm happy for the folks who seemed to have found deeper meaning in all this, but I think the author would have been better served if he had just published a collection of Irish folklore and stayed away from trying to craft a novel around those tales. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

It was only when I got it home and was reading the cover that I saw that Ms. Funke was a writer of children's books.  But Venice is one of my favorite cities and the writing level was obviously aimed at a high enough level that I didn't particularly feel that I was reading a children's book so I continued. <br /> <br />I was happily surprised as I read this book.  It seems rare these days that you can find a novel that holds your interest, let alone one that is written for children that an adult can enjoy.  The descriptions of Venice are simply stunning.  The characters are intensely believable (Except maybe Aunt Esther).   <br /> <br />No, the novel isn't infused with magic like Harry Potter, but there is just enough at the end to make the novel sparkle.  To tell what the magic is about would spoil the plot, but it certainly made me stop and think if I would make the same choices as some of the characters in the book.   <br /> <br />I do wonder about some of the children's books that are out these days.  They certainly aren't all sweetness and light.  This one deals with some pretty harsh subjects of street children, unloved/unwanted children, and crime.  I Definitely would not recommend this for the very young reader. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

You don't read these for the literary experience; you read them for the WOW and entertainment factors.    In this installment you have to ask the question what has an old Viking expedition to the New York Hudson river valley; 20,000 leagues under the sea; and a luxury, state of the art ocean liner; all have in common.

I have the 1,000 series Indian, Mexican, and Italian and all are wonderful.  This one however is headed for my local used book trader. <br /> <br />There is no imagination in this book.  I feel that the author just doesn't like food.  She makes no effort to impart any taste what so ever in the recipes.  Plus the approach uses lots of processed foods; things like egg substitutes, low-fat everything, and canned goods galore.  I personally feel that it's possible to eat a fairly low fat diet, avoid processed foods (which I think are just as harmful as the fat), and actually have something that tastes good. <br /> <br />Plus the author must have taken to heart that you can't have any meat other than chicken or fish.  Now I know that many cuts of beef can be high in fat, but an occasional, well seasoned, portion controlled, lean piece of beef isn't going to totally ruin your diet.  But not so here.  If it's not chicken, poultry, or fish; you can forget it.  (And whatever happened to pork, the other white meat?) <br /> <br />Shop around, there are better low-fat books to be had. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

I actually enjoyed this more than \\"Girl with Perl Earring\\".  This is the story not only of the making of the six beautiful and famous tapestries, but of several people. <br /> <br />The major players are Nicolas des Innocents the artist who designed the tapestries, Jean La Viste the man who had the tapestries commissioned, Claude La Viste the daughter of Jean, Genivieve La Viste Jean's wife and Claude's mother, Georges de LaChappelle the weaver of the tapestries, Christine Georges's wife and Alienor, Georges's blind daughter.  <br /> <br />Ms. Chevalier tells her story in a series of chapters that are narrated by each of the characters.  Although the view point of the story changes with each chapter, the story does not suffer from the changes of view, but flows wonderfully.  She masterfully weaves a story not only of how the tapestries are created, but a story of Claude's sexual awakenings and her desire for a man that she cannot have, a story of Alienor and how she does what she must so that she does not have to marry a man distasteful to her, Genivieve's life as a dutiful wife and mother despite the fact that she wants to become a nun, Georges struggle to complete the tapestries on time, and Christine's joy at being able to help weave the tapestries.  It is truly amazing that she manages to pack so many plots and sub-plots into a book without totally confusing the reader, but she succeeds. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

US	49872352	REBDFI15A9LW1	0385337116	520405863	The Rule of Four	Books	3	4	5	N	N	An acceptable first effort	This book is not nearly as hideous as some of the reviewers try and make it sound.  It is flawed, but it can be an enjoyable read. <br /> <br />The authors have followed one the primary rules of writing.  Write what you know.  And they obviously know Princeton.  The information about the traditions, background, and insights in the workings of Princeton give believability to the story.  One of our four roommates is attempting to break a code in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.  It's true the unraveling of this mystery lacks excitement, probably because no one outside of certain small circles has ever even heard of this one before.  Plus, the actual solution of the code isn't that exciting.   <br /> <br />There is another subplot that involves the book, but it's amongst the others who have worked on unlocking the book's secrete in the past.  And on this front people seem to keep showing up dead.  <br /> <br />Others have said that the romance angle in the book is not realistic.  I think that perhaps it is.  Not everyone falls in love at first glance and romances during college can be difficult, particularly when one part of the couple graduates before the other and they are left with a long distance romance.   <br /> <br />I don't want to give the ending away, but I found it rather intriguing.   <br /> <br />But the book does have major flaws.  The same thing that gives it is believability of being at Princeton does wear on those of us who went to those lesser non-ivy league schools.  There were several condescending comments to remind us that we're just not of the same caliber.  And as I've mentioned earlier, solving the \\"secret\\" of the book is about as exciting as reading the back of a cereal box.   <br /> <br />The other major flaw was the way that the authors transitioned back and forth between times.  They would take you on a look to the past and then - boom - drop you right back into present time in the middle of a conversation.   <br /> <br />It's a first attempt, not a block buster, but not that bad. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

US	49872352	R3VWBMCMJD0WL0	1582344167	481973042	Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell	Books	3	3	6	N	N	2 stars for the 1st half of the book, 4 for the last	. . . that gives an average of 3 stars. <br /> <br />This really could have been two books.  The first would end at the point where Napoleon is defeated at Waterloo.  But, if I had read that 1st book, I probably would not have gone on to read the second because the 1st was so boring.  Interestingly, most of the descriptions that I've read of the book really only address what happens in the first half of the book.  They talk about how the two magicians go out and help England fight the forces of Napoleon using magic.  Quite frankly, this part of the book is unbelievably boring and the plot seems to go nowhere.  In fact, the whole thing with Napeleon has nothing to do with the last half of the book other than to have introduced a couple of characters whose background could have been explained in one sentence.  It also gives a reason for the two magicians notoriety.  All of that could have been done in a chapter or two.  The first half of the book is also where we become painfully acquainted with Ms. Clarke's annoying footnotes.  There is one of these disgusting things that runs the major portion of 4 pages in tiny mice type.  If all this information is truly important to the story line, then put it in the text!  As one reviewer suggested, you get the feeling that she just couldn't figure out how to work it into the text, so she just stuck it in the footnote.  I suppose that she feels that it give the book a feeling of being an historical work.  No, it's irritating!  I also read that it took Ms. Clarke 10 years to write this 800+ page beast.  To me it's almost like she's learning to write during the course of the book.  By about mid-way, she figures out how to do it.  It's too bad that a good editor or publisher didn't convince her to reduce the 1st half of the book to a few background paragraphs explaining how Mr. Norrell \\"came out of the closet\\" so to speak, how he met Jonathan Strange, and how they rose to fame in England. <br /> <br />But once the war is over and Strange and Norrell part company because they have vastly different ideas on how the future of magic should unfold in England is where the real and good book begins.  Here we start exploring the motivations behind the characters, their good and bad points, what makes them tick.  Here I actually started loosing myself in the rich descriptions of Venice and the strange old woman who holds the secret of how a mere mortal can gain access to Farie.  Here the novel actually starts to seem magical.  Although the annoying footnotes continue, they seem to shrink in size. <br /> <br />One thing that I feel I must address is the claim that this is an \\"adult\\" Harry Potter.  I know I'm not the first to say this, but it's not.  Harry Potter has the major underlying theme of good vs. evil.  In this book, there is no monolithic struggle between good and evil.  Each character is painted in shades of grey, each with a mixture of good and evil making a complex whole.  This book is more about the interaction between these people and their internal struggles with themselves. <br /> <br />It's quite obvious at the end of the book that Ms. Clarke is leaving it open so that if she feels like it she can write a sequel.  I'll probably read it, but I sincerely hope it will read more like the last half of this book than the first half. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

Plus, Peter is not depicted as a happy go lucky little boy who refuses to grow up.  He is depicted as a selfish little brat.  He wants everything his way and he doesn't care who he hurts to achieve it. <br /> <br />I certainly wouldn't recommend reading this to a 5 or 6 year old before they drift off to sleep.  There are just too many references to the fact that Dad in particular, may not have wanted all three of those children.  There is also a very healthy amount of violence that you just might not want your elementary kid listening to.  Peter cut off Hook's arm and threw it to the crocodile.  The lost boys are always fighting either the \\"redskins\\" or the pirates.  And if you're into the politically correct, this book is not.  Instead of using the modern day \\"native American\\" we're given \\"redskin\\".  I don't have a problem with it, but I can just see the furor it would cause if Jr. goes to school and calls his little native American classmate a redskin. <br /> <br />This may be a classic that is past its prime.   <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

US	49872352	R1BE5AGOIEUV5F	0743420357	678446245	The Medici Dagger	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Great script, OK novel	Yes, folks, it's another Da Vinci Code wanabe.  Although Mr. West delivers a fast paced, entertaining novel, he does not deliver a novel that is as thought provoking as it could have been.  It's clear that this novel was written to be just a few stage directions away from being an action packed box office draw.      The concept is interesting, that Da Vinci produced a dagger out of metal that is so advanced that he feels that he must hide it in case it is used for evil purposes.  And Reb (our hero) seems to be the chosen one to rediscover it and . . . . and what kind of falls away, since obviously the real purpose of this book is the action.  And of course, we have a great supporting cast of the beautiful woman that needs to be saved, the crusty curmudgeon, and the ever present Viet Name vet.  The book is certainly not that well researched.  Many of the details of Leonardo's time and life could be found in just a few hours of research in the library or on the web.      Also, we're led to believe that this is supposed to be a real accomplishment to decipher the writing and figure out the secret.  I'm not very good at brain teasers or riddles, but I figured out over half of the clues before the hero did.      Where the book does seem to shine is in the stunt screens.  This book as a movie is a real stunt man's dream.  They'll get to slide under buses on busy streets, have fight scenes on the edge of cliffs, and get to sling around lots and lots of nifty firearms in the process.  Much of the book is truly written for a visual interpretation.  And who can resist all the beautiful location shots in Venice, Rome and the coast of California.    If this does make it to the silver screen with a decent cast, it could very well be a case where the movie may be better than the book.

Please remember this is fiction and that the point of the story wasn't to portray the actual events, but to explore the relationship between a daughter and her father using characters who are familiar but about which we really don't know many facts. <br /> <br />And what a job has been done here with not only exploring the relationship between William and Judith, but between the entire Shakespeare clan.  Ms. Tiffany does a wonderful job creating an extremely complex character in Judith.  She's haunted by the death of her twin brother; torn between love, hate and resentment of her father; drawn to a life that as a woman in the 1600s is impossible for her to live.   <br /> <br />Ms. Tiffany also spends time exploring the relationship between Judith and her mother.  It's quite clear that she worships her father and doesn't really think much of her mother in the beginning, but as the book develops and time passes we see that the relationship between Judith and her mother improves as she matures and begins to realize some of the dynamics that exist between her mother and father.   <br /> <br />But the main charm is watching the relationship between William and Judith.  We see her rather normal hero worship of her father as a child, followed by the inevitable disillusionment toward her father when she discovers that he is using the family tragedies as a source of material for his plays.  When she sets out for London to embarrass him she ends up with a greater understanding of her father's existence and what drives him which leads to forgiveness.   <br /> <br />I'll be getting a copy of Will (Ms. Tiffany's story about William) soon. <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

Although it was interesting and entertaining, I didn't find it nearly as interesting as his Vampire series. <br /> <br />I found the book a bit lacking in the descriptions of what was going on.  I wasn't sure by the end of the book if we had 2 or 3 swords in play since they all seemed to have so many different names.  Also some of the plot didn't seem quite connected. <br /> <br />I must temper this criticism by saying that I'm not a real fantasy series lover.  I prefer my books (usually) to end at the last page and not to be continued in the next book.  The thought of having to read 11 more books to get the full story really turns me off. <br /> <br />If you like fantasy books that are part of a series, you'll probably enjoy this.

US	49872352	R1Y28LNU6336CZ	1591856132	236027041	Shadowmancer: What can stand against an ancient evil. . .	Books	3	9	10	N	N	I feel misled	I'm being generous and giving this 3 stars.  I was seriously considering giving it 2 stars since I felt a little misled by the write-up on the dustcover. <br /> <br />I picked this up in a major bookstore on a sales table under the Science Fiction/fantasy banner.  I notice that in Amazon, it's under Children's books, and Religious.  With that in mind I'll but aside my disappointment that the subject was not what I had thought and try to give it a fair rating based on what the book really was. <br /> <br />Keeping in mind that this book's audience is probably adolescents, I now understand why our heroes appear to be somewhere between the age of 12 to maybe early 20s.  If you keep in mind that the target audience is not adult, then this age seems reasonable. <br /> <br />I also found out, after reading about  of the book that this is being touted as a Christian alternative to the Harry Potter books.  For folks that are looking for that alternative, I would advise the parents to check the book out before allowing your children reading the book.  Although many of the characters resemble Christian entities, they aren't really true to what I learned in my Episcopalian Sunday School.  We have Riathamus (the representation of God), Pyratheon (the representation of the devil) and several oddly named creatures that represent angles and demons.  There are also cases of demon possession.  I know that not all branches of Christianity believe in possession.  Also there is only mention of Riathamus who to me seems to be God.  I didn't notice any character in the novel that could have been Christ.  Or maybe Riathamus was kind of a God/Christ.  I'm not really a fundamental Christian, but I can see where a parent might have problems with some of the way all this is presented. <br /> <br />The book is just OK for an adult reader.  Since the main characters are young, it doesn't have the appeal it might have had with a more adult set of heroes.  It left me with a slight feeling of them (youth) against us (adults).  In addition, since the book is misrepresented, the unaware reader may be a bit shocked about 1/3 of the way through when they realize that they have been dropped into a \\"Left Behind\\" wannabe. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

Once again, he has written a wonderful novel that mixes historical facts, real places, real people, and an epic timeline with fictional characters to produce an entertaining and educational work. <br /> <br />Mr. Rutherfurd is one of those novelists that take a place and craft a story around that place over many centuries, populating it with facts and people that make history come alive.  He has carried on with this effort.

That horrible book is just not true.  To accomplish this, he conjures up a huge snow storm to trap a descendent of one of the original characters and then leaves the real story on a tape recorder. <br /> <br />At first I thought that this was very tongue and cheek, with Dracula trying to convince us that he was just misunderstood.  He really wasn't that bad.  He didn't bring a baby for the women in his castle to feed on; it was a pig.  He didn't kill all those people on the ship; it was the crazy 1st mate.  He didn't kill Lucy on purpose; he was just saving her from crazy Van Helsing.  And on and on.   <br /> <br />But by the end of the book, which I will not divulge, I believed that Dracula really wasn't such a bad guy.  The fun part for me was in the process of convincing me. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

This decision is prompted in great part by the fact that I am not a fan of romance novels.  (Excuse me; the cover calls Ms. Roberts a write of women's fiction.  And please, get another photo that makes you look less like a .... well makes you look a bit more plesant.)  At any rate, for me to read a work of \\"women's fiction\\" there needs to be more there than a love story.  Well in the case of this book, it's three love stories; and amazingly, between three siblings.  And of course they are all trying to unite the three fates.  The trilogy thing gets overworked, as does the analogies to the three fates.   <br /> <br />The three fates are three women from mythology.  The first spins the thread, the second measures it, and the third cuts it.  By the middle of the book, whenever one of the characters, usually Tia, went into another one of their soliloquies about \\"weaving-the-thread-into-a-tapestry-and-we're-all-destined-to-be-together\\" rants, I just skipped to where the story actually started again. <br /> <br />At any rate, Ms. Roberts' attempts at injecting some form of meaning or depth into her fiction are shallow and contrived. <br /> <br />As another reader pointed out the Prologue was good, and then, the book falls flat on it's face.  I have always been amazed at how in \\"women's fiction\\" people manage to fall in love at first sight.  In reality, I just don't think that happens.  We have six people in this book, three of which are related, and they all fall madly, head over heals in love within hours of meeting their soon to be partners.  The chances of that happening are slim to none.  And the pairings are so bizarre.  We're to believe that a healthy Irishman who runs a boat tour company in Ireland is going to fall for a neurotic, wealthy PHD; that his younger brother is going to fall for a rebel, ex-exotic dancer, who is also rich but has had a falling out with her family; andthat their sister falls for a wealthy self made man in the security business.  Of all the romances, the last was to me the most believable.   <br /> <br />Bottom line:  not really believable, not literary, not worth your time. <br /> <br />My star ratings: <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

US	49872352	RMJ9CT6R5ZRWH	0446515078	861890745	Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind	Books	4	2	3	N	N	I liked the book better than I expected	For those of you who don't know, this book is the \\"continuation\\" of Gone with the Wind.  Scarlett starts the book out having lost many of the people she suddenly finds that she truly cares about.  And in true Scarlett tradition, she sets out to try and get the one that's still alive back.  Of course it's Rhett. <br /> <br />I found that I enjoyed to book much more than I anticipated.  The main reason is the richness and clarity that Ms. Ripley portrayed Savannah, Charleston, and Ireland.  I live in a suburb of Atlanta, and two of my favorite weekend getaway spots are Savannah and Charleston.  It was so easy for me to imagine those cities as they might have been a few years after the civil war through Ms. Ripley's portrayal.  She paints Atlanta as the rather cultureless boom town (not too unlike it is today), Charleston as the southern bastion of culture and sophistication, and Savannah in much the same light with a little more of the middle class thrown in. <br /> <br />I am not as familiar with Ireland, but based on the wonderful job she did describing the atmosphere in the other locals, I'm sure her portrayal of Ireland was excellent as well. <br /> <br />Most of her characters are well developed and interesting.  Scarlett is introduced to both her family in Savannah and in Ireland.  We all introduced to Rhett's family in Charleston.  Her handling of Scarlett and Rhett was not quite as satisfying.  Scarlet, although throughout the book is described as \\"grown up\\" still exhibits the selfishness that seems to be her signature.  Even though she claims undying love for Rhett now, I'm never totally convinced that she really, really cares.  Other aspects of her character are more believable.  She is practical, obsessed with money (a result of never being hungry again), and not particularly cultured.  She makes one huge faux paux when they are discussing Rhett's sister visiting Rome.  She mentions that it's not that far from Atlanta and surely she has some relatives or friends that she could stay with.  She is just totally unaware that they are discussing Rome, Italy not Rome, Ga.  She is described as not liking books all that much, and although she is impressed by the trappings of wealth, she really doesn't care about its significance.  Overall, she can be a sympathetic character, but a great deal of the time; she's still irritating and annoying. <br /> <br />Although Rhett has divorced her, we are led to believe that he still cares for her.  This fondness is never explained to my satisfaction.  They really have nothing in common.  Where Rhett is trying to reestablish camellias at the plantation, Scarlett doesn't \\"get it\\" and is more concerned about him planting crops.  Where Rhett is one of the Charleston sophisticated, Scarlett calls herself a country girl from Clayton County Georgia.  Even Rhett's explanation at the end, just isn't satisfying. <br /> <br />The ending isn't all rosie, but Ms. Ripley can't help but end it with an almost \\"and they lived happily ever after\\".  <br /> <br />Read it for the portrayal of the cities involved and the attitudes and thoughts of those cities' inhabitants.  Just accept Rhett and Scarlett for what they are and enjoy the book. <br /> <br />My star ratings: <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

I actually received this book as a Christmas present several years ago from my broker.  I had stuck it on the shelf and hadn't touched it because I just assumed that anything that a broker would send wouldn't be interesting.  Well I was wrong.    The book follows Nick Neuman to Switzerland and a new job in a Swiss bank that his father had worked for years ago in an effort to uncover who killed his father several years earlier.  The book had enough plot turns to keep it interesting even if you could see some of them coming.  I suppose that the book has more meaning now than it would have when it was written since its main \\"bad guy\\" is a mid-easterner who is generating and laundering money for the express reason of bringing down the non-Muslim infidel.  I suppose it's not amazing that he resembles UBL, but it seems to have more significance in the wake of 9/11.    The book is packed with folks who aren't who they seem to be, double crosses, and action.  It's a good read.  I notice that the book is out of print, so if you run across a copy in a used book store, spend a few bucks and pick it up.

The cover admits that the book was first published in 1983 and obviously it was \\"updated\\" before it was re-released.  Those updates sometimes don't ring true.  We have reference to 9/11 and then something about it happening 12 years ago.  It does throw off the chronology a bit.  Yes, the book is riding on the coat tails of the Da Vinci Code, but that's just good old marketing making money off of a hot topic.  (Hey, it worked, I had read the Da Vinci Code and I picked it up to read on a business trip.)  And the book does not have the feel to me of having been extensively researched like the Da Vinci Code.  It doesn't immerse you in details, it's more of an action book.    But now on to the good things.      Lewis Perdue has woven a good who donit based on the generally accepted knowledge that Leonardo was brilliant far past his time.  Someone has stolen certain pages from one of his manuscripts and doesn't particularly care who's killed to get them back.  Our hero is a bit unbelievable.  Let's see he works for an oil company finding new oil fields, but his employer lets him moonlight as a da Vinci expert.  In his guise of da Vinci expert he suddenly finds that everyone who has looked at the manuscript is dead or being hunted down, including him.  He picks up a romantic interest in the guise of an art magazine writer who just happens to be an ex CIA operative.  What follows is a whirl wind race around Italy dodging evil corporate heads, discredited monks, and terrorists.    OK,  when I write all that out it does sound preposterous, but remember, this is fiction.

One day I decided to try one of her earlier works written under a pen name to see what it was like.    I was somewhat disappointed.  I understand that this is early writing and it shows in that she has not yet developed her prose to the levels that you find in her vampire, witch, and other novels.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that the novel reads more like a romance novel than erotica.  I actually find some of her passages in her latter works that skirt with the subject of the erotic more exciting than this less veiled attempt.    In all honesty, I didn't finish the book.  (By my own scale, I should have given it one start, but I'm cutting some slack here because it's Anne Rice.)  The reason:  boredom.  There just wasn't enough here to hold my interest.  I'm not particularly into bondage or S & M and the storey itself didn't interest me enough to continue on to the bitter end.

Some of the reviewer's talk about all the symbolism, but I'd recommend reading the book just for the fantasy of it and the wonderful prose of Mr. Peake.  Some reviewer's talked about how it was slow moving and boring.  At times the pace of the book did slow, but in those times read for the beauty of the words and the vivid picture that is painted by those words.      This is a collection of three books, Titus Groan, Gormenghast, and Titus Alone.  I will admit that I enjoyed the 1st two books much more than the last, Titus Alone.  Titus Alone seemed to take such a departure from the first two that I had a hard time relating it back to the first two.    I'd recommend these for someone who wants to get lost in another world.

The illustrations were wonderful and I enjoyed flipping back and forth between the text and the drawings following the narrative through the towns.  What I wasn't expecting was the author using this as a forum to criticize various towns planning commissions, one grocery (I assume) chain, and various social practices through the ages.  Being from the United States, I wouldn't be surprised if he found himself sued by the aforementioned chain.  He seemed to delight on criticizing their practice of removing supposedly historic buildings and putting in their mega marts.  Don't get me wrong, I value historic buildings and am always upset when one is lost to parking lots, and mega stores, but he even seems to criticize one instance where a new store was built on an already empty lot with sensitivity to the surrounding buildings.    He also seems to go on a couple of rants about the treatment of workers during various points in history.  He also seems to somehow feel that a town populated mainly by retirees is a bad thing.  I'd hate to see how he'd handle some towns in Florida and Arizona that I know of.    The other thing that I found a little difficult were references to things that I assume are common knowledge in the UK, but for those of us in the US meant nothing.  I can't really hold that against him, that's just a warning.    Bottom line, read the book for the drawings, architecture, and history.  Skip over the rants.

Hugh can be inspiring in the classic role of the underdog out to right wrongs.  Baldwin and Stephen are classic bad guys with absolutely no redeeming traits.  The whole concept of a holy relic is so symbolic on so many levels.  Hugh's 2nd love is a classic \\"love conquers all\\".  The book is fast paced (most of the chapters are only 3 pages long).  It's full of action.  It's just a fun read.    The book is not a historically accurate historical novel.  I doubt that most of the events in the novel would have occurred.  I know there were peasant uprisings throughout history, but they were rare.  The fact that a ****warning plot spoiler ***** king's daughter would fall in love with a pesant, marry him, and have dad's blessing is highly unlikely.  *****End of Plot spoiler****    So if you just want a fun read, please invest the time.  If you're looking for the incredible detail of say a Penman, just walk away.

US	49872352	R2TXF17XWG9QYA	156261424X	211708178	Travel Smart: Maryland/Delaware: Also Includes Washington, D.C.	Books	2	1	1	N	N	A big disappointment	The book is titled Travel Smart Maryland/Delaware with the subtitle of Includes Washington D.C.  It would have been better named Travel Smart Maryland/Washington D. C. with a subtitle of Barely includes Delaware.  Out of some 240 pages, a mere 30 are concerned with Delaware.  I have found more information on a couple of web sites than were included in this book.  This was a big disappointment to me since I was primarily interested in Delaware.  Almost equal time was given to Washington and Maryland.  (If I was going to Washington, I'd recommend either the Access or Eyewitness guides over this thing.)    Beside the fact that it didn't really cover the place I wanted information on, what it did provide, I found rather lacking when compared to other guide books.  On the cover, it states that the author only lists \\"the best places to eat, stay and visit.\\"  Well, that turns out to be pretty limiting.  I know just from a quick Expedia search that there are many more accommodation choices in Wilmington than the author listed.  I'd rather have a list, with an indicator of the price range and the service level and let me decide what the \\"best place\\" is.  I have no problem with the author indicating his/her favorites.  The same treatment was given to restaurant selections.  Again, I prefer the list of restaurants, the type of cuisine, the price range and some indication or the food quality and let me pick where I want to eat.    The back cover claims that the author lists scenic routes.  Well, he/she does, but only 3 and they are pretty much a start here, drive to here, end up here.  There is absolutely no suggestions as to neat places to stop, see, eat, stay, etc.    Again the back of the book says it lists itineraries for special interests.  Well, it does, but it's just a list of things like \\"Historic homes in Brandywine valley, Historic home in Washington D.C., etc.\\", and a total time to accomplish seeing the entire list.  Again, no idea of how long it might take to see each of the \\"suggestions\\", no indication of a town to stay in that's convenient to the \\"suggestions\\", no real effort put in at all.    I don't remember if the author lists opening times, prices of admission, directions to sites or not.  I guess I was getting pretty disgusted by that point.     And if you like photographs, you won't find many here.  Photos are few, black and white and mostly from the tourist bureau.    The only saving thing about this book is that the maps are plentiful and adequate.    I'll continue looking for a decent guide to Delaware, and if you're looking for a guidebook to Delaware, I can assure you, this isn't it.

I have enjoyed some of Anne's previous novels that had nothing to do with Vampires, particularly \\"A Cry to Heaven\\".  Sometimes a writer just wears out a subject and I think Anne may have reached that point.    I vacillated between giving this 3 or 4 stars and settled on 4 just because it's Anne, because she lost Stan, and because I'd like to see her continue to write and hopefully produce novels like she used to.    The things that are right with the novel are many.  Anne still can make you see what's happening with her prose.  When I read this I can see New Orleans, I can see that graveyard and swamp behind the house, I'm there.  She does try and bring many (but not all) of the threads from both the vampire chronicles and the Mayfair Witches to a conclusion.  A nice gesture if you're really going to leave the subject.  I did notice though that there is ample opportunity to write another one (or many) novels with the introduction of Lestat and Rowen's love.  I felt Lestat blasting us about not liking previous works and telling us that he wants to be a saint is quite OK.  That's Lestat!      The thing that did annoy me with this novel the most was Anne/Lestat's \\"new\\" narrative style.  I suppose that it's supposed to be new and edgy and as one reader suggested Lestat is allowed to change, including his narrative style, but I miss the prose that I just gushed about in the proceeding paragraph.  The \\"Pope is wonderful\\" rant was a little off-putting since I would think that Lestat would think himself above such matters, but you must remember he is a French Catholic.  I must admit that after the first book on the Mayfair Witches they have not been my favorite subject that Anne has written about.  And I guess I've always been a little irritated that she combined the Witches with the Vampires.    Yes, I'll read Anne's next book if it's about Vampires or about turnips.  I have been disappointed in some of her efforts and enthralled by others.  She's human (even if her alter ego isn't) and she's going to have good, bad and mediocre efforts.  I won't give up because of a couple of stinkers.    My star ratings:    One star - couldn't finish the book  Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

US	49872352	R2U9BPC5TMADYB	0060509546	707173567	Tropic of Night	Books	3	7	13	N	N	Actually about 3 and 1/2 stars	Although I'm not usually into \\"who done its\\" I found this book to be surprisingly good.  First a warning, you owe it to yourself to read at least 3 chapters before you throw it away.  I must admit that the first chapter pretty much turned me off.  I wasn't into some strange woman killing a child's mom and then \\"adopting\\" the little girl.  The second chapter kind of irritated me, and by the 3rd I had decided that the book was worth a read.     The things about the book that kept me away from the 4 stars were that, as I said, I'm not a big mystery fan and (like another reader) the inclusion of so much vocabulary about magic and sorcery.  It's lends authenticity to supply facts, but I prefer my fiction without a glossary.  (Yes, there is a glossary.)      But what I did like about the book was the writing.  At first I found the inclusion of the journals hard to follow.  Then I realized it's just like what I write in my daily planner.  There are abbreviations and it's not meant to be full sentences, it just the capturing of thoughts.  Once you get into the spirit, it gives so much background of how Jane Doe got there, what makes her tick, and what led up to the current state of affairs.  Then there are two more narratives that are more traditional, the narrative given in the here and now by Jane and the one given by Paz.  The mixture of the three view points makes for an interesting and rich writing style.     I'd be inclined to try another of Mr. Gruber's novels in the future.

US	49872352	R2IYIVVRLS6948	0345416260	21574649	Pope Joan: A Novel	Books	3	6	7	N	N	A pleasant if not always believable read	This was an enjoyable read, but it could have been much more.    The premise that a woman in the 8th century managed to pass herself off as a woman and even to have become Pope is quite intriguing.  It's certainly a believable concept.  There are several documented cases of women passing themselves off as men throughout history.      Where I have to take issue with the story is that some of the details of Joan's life require just a little too much suspension of disbelief.  Joan was born to a minor cleric who was had probably all the hang-ups about women and sex that could possibly be invented by the church at that time.  There was the usual; women were the root of all sin, women shouldn't be educated - it's bad for them, women should be kept barefoot and pregnant.  It certainly didn't sit well with him that his daughter wanted to learn things other than darning and cooking.  The thought of a girl reading Latin just about pushed him over the edge.      But at the same time, her father wanted very badly for his son to be well educated and that gave Joan her break.  She got her brother to teach her after father taught him.  That part of the story rang plausible.  When the older brother dies and a tutor is found for the younger brother, the tutor begins to teach Joan because he finds her so eager and intelligent.  I can even believe that.  Educators are often liberal and willing to overlook the accepted practices of the day.    When the story breaks down is when Joan runs away with her brother to attend a school that is run by the church.  I find it extremely difficult to believe that this was feasible.  Large established institutions are not noted (and never have been) for their willingness to be flexible.    Once Joan's brother is killed and she assumes his identity and joins a monastery we're back in the realm of believability.  There Joan excels in healing and through a bizarre quirk of fate finds herself at the Vatican taking care of the Pope.  From there with somemore improbable occurrences, she becomes Pope.     Intertwined with this is a story of mostly unrequited love with a man who has no love for his wife and has decided to run away with Joan.  Of course he makes this decision just a little too late.  Joan's brother has been killed and she's passing herself off as a man and in a monastery.  Once Joan is in Rome, they meet up again as he has become a defender of the faith.  We're supposed to believe further that because they get stranded during a flood and left alone, they finally consummate their love, resulting in pregnancy for Joan.  This is a very Catholic belief, that just one act of sex definitely will result in pregnancy.    With all it's short fallings, it's worth a read and not too taxing, so if you have time and want to be entertained, go for it.

I have seen most of the movies that were made from them and have enjoyed most of them.  I was moved to read this one after the flack over the much publicized \\"plot changes\\" that were prompted by sensitivity to the 9/11 tragedies.  Curiosity led me to buy the book and read it to see what the changes were.      Yes, the movie did change the bad guys from Arab Muslims to some neo-nazi types, but I never understood how detailed these books were.  I have decided to stick to the movie versions.  I cannot fault Clancy for his writing, it's just more input than I want.  I really don't care about the exact sequence of how a nuclear devise explodes.  I really don't want to know the manufacturing process of that devise in detail.    I gave the book 3 stars because (at least for me) if I skip the pages and pages of technical detail the book is entertaining.  I certainly don't want to try and chase folks away from this book if this type of detail is your cup of tea.

The reason that I couldn't like the book more was the major female character of Joanna.  She has a real conflict between loyalty to her husband Llewelyn and her father King John of England.  This conflict I can understand and it added depth to her character, but there was another conflict for Joanna and that was trying to reconcile her memory of her father as kind and loving with the truth of the King who was often ruthless and cruel.  I can understand that conflict also, but the combination of the two made Joanna act in irresponsible and often just downright stupid ways.  I suppose Ms. Penman was trying to express the confusion, hurt, and pressure that these two conflicts caused in Joanna, but the end result was a stupid, nave character that I just thought of as a spoiled brat.    Ms. Penman leans toward romance and much of the book was about the love between Llewelyn and Joanna.  Because of Joanna's inability to make an intelligent decision, this love was tested often.  By the time that Joanna pulled yet another stupid decision and had an affair with a man that she herself admitted she didn't love and Llewelyn sent her away, I was truly hoping the Lllwelyn would stick by his guns and live the rest of his life as a tragic figure.    Ms. Penman is capable of producing strong and interesting female characters as evidenced by the inclusion of Eleanor of Acquitane (John's mother).  I see that Ms. Penman's book Time and Chance deals with Eleanor and it may coax me to read another of Ms. Penman's books.  So I haven't written her off yet.

Although its billed as a mystery, its really more of a theoretical theology tale.  Mr. Brown certainly did a lot of research for this book.  A lot of the premises that he sets forth, I checked up on and found them to be real.<br />For example, yes, there really is an Opus Dei.  Yes, there is a web site....Read his description of Da Vincis last supper with a good copy of it at hand to follow along.  Its astounding how the symbolism he describes is there.<br />Im sure that Mr. Brown has done nothing to endear himself with some in the Catholic community, since he does paint the church in somewhat the light of the bad guy, but none the less, he has put forward a very interesting theory.  Im sure that if I were a student of comparative religions, of the Knights Templar or of symbology many of the theories that Mr. Brown has put forward are in the learned literature, but Mr. Brown has put them into an enjoyable read for us common folks.<br />I must however subtract one star from the book for the same criticisms that many of the other reviewers have stated.  The only character that is given any real motivation seems to be Silas.  All the other characters seem to be there for the delivery of dialogue to explain the theory that Mr. Brown is developing.	2003-08-06

When Mr. Smith wants to, the story could be extremely interesting.  His description of a sandstorm was magnificent.  His descriptions of different forms of death and violence are also magnificent, but just a big turnoff for me.  A particularly gruesome chapter was the one about \\"running the red road\\".  I can only assume that the \\"red road\\" is named for the amount of blood spilled along the way.  I found that the only way I could finish the book was to skip all the parts where he started describing war strategy and skimming the really bloody parts.	2003-07-21

The movie follows the book fairly faithfully for the first part, but after that, the movie takes a very different and much more feel good path.    But that aside, let's discuss the book as it is.  The three witches are not particularly likeable.  They are spiteful and vindictive.  I guess I was dismayed at how much they talked about treasuring life, and then how quickly they would just kill someone or thing.  I felt like Mr. Updike was trying to make some sweeping comment about humanity in general, but I never quite \\"got\\" it.  It was almost as if, we had three different women, who just happened to be witches and we were given a look into how they would react if they really could make someone's life a living hell.  As a character study, it was interesting.  Jane seemed to be the most vindictive and hateful.  Alexandra seemed the most caring, but even she had a vindictive streak that she usually felt sorry for after the fact.  She managed to kill one day, and one squirrel just because they were irritating.  Sukie struck me as the flaky one.    I feel that the novel was supposed to be an allegory, but I still found it a bit disturbing that the three witches were portrayed as quite so promiscuous.  I just can't believe that in a small town, there could be three women that were having affairs with just about every married man in town and no one seemed to notice.  It also seemed to be common knowledge that the three were witches and no one seemed to think that unusual.    In spite of the characters that aren't particularly likeable and the unbelievably of a lot of the novel, it still seems to draw you into the story and I found myself continuing to read, just to see how it all would end.

Several of the ideas have been put forward in other vampire books or film before.  I know that the idea of vampirism being a disease process has been used before, I know that some of the modern day vampires walk around in the day light, several authors have suggested that famous historical people have really been vampires, and I know lots of the more modern vampires are \\"good\\" people.      Mr. Romkey takes all these ideas and weaves them into a reasonably entertaining read.  The premise is that an archeologist dies in Costa Rica while investigating ancient Indian ruins.  It turns out that these are really owned by a vampire.  When the archeologist turns up dead, Dr. Bailey of the Centers for Disease Control goes down to see if there is a possible new \\"killer\\" virus involved.  Dr. Bailey becomes involved with two ancient vampires, both with very interesting previous lives.  One, a former conquistador, and the second a vampire named Ludwig, also a famous man from the past.    Although the story is a fair read, it has flaws.  Ludwig is part of the Illuminati.  This is supposedly a group of old world vampires who sound like a vampire support group, but they are never really explained.  I notice that Mr. Romkey has written other vampire books and perhaps they are explained in more detail in another book.  There do seem to be some characters thrown in that have no real purpose.  There's an old man that the priest calls on that is never explained.  The former affair of the priest does explain why he's there in the middle of nowhere but doesn't really add much to the story.    It short, although not extremely original, it's a light entertaining read.

The story follows a well know historical triangle between Queen Catherine de Medici , her husband, King Henri II, and his lover, Diane de Poitiers.  Then through in an elderly and cranky Nostradamus and you've got a funny and entertaining novel.     It would appear that both Queen Catherine and Diane de Poitiers want to get their hands on The Master of All Desires, aka Menander the Undying.  Menander is a disembodied head that can grant any wish.  The problem is he has a nasty habit of granting your wish, but always with the classic saying \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\"  Meanander is in the hands of a young Sibille Artaud de La Roque who refuses to make a wish and is trying to free herself of Menander so that she can marry her love Nicolas and have a normal life.    The result is a true delight that feels like a modern day Shakespeare comedy.  I can't wait to read more of Ms. Riley's work.

We're asked to believe that William can survive a hugh explosion by being blown clear in a barrel, he can fight giant crocodiles barehanded and the best is the survival of plunging to earth from the back of a plane (airborne) in an tank.

I did find that the editing and proofreading was surprisingly good for a writer that is so prolific and obviously writes for a popular audience.    The book is an interesting blend of romance, thriller, who done it, and murder mystery.  I was a bit unsettled by the rather surprise ending.  I felt like Ms. Roberts was spitting in the face of morality, but I dont want to spoil the plot.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found one of the strengths in the novel to be in the character study of some very strong female characters.  Although she spent some time developing her male characters, Ms. Roberts really concentrated on the women.  Obviously, Ms. Roberts is pitching her writing toward the female audience.    There were 3 main women characters Tereza Giambelli, Pilar Giambelli Avano and Sophia Giambelli (really Avano).  Tereza is the matriarch and is motivated by duty, family and tradition.  She will do any thing to keep what she has worked all her life to build.    Pilar is Terezas daughter and came of age during the 60s and 70s, but she obviously was the good girl growing up and seems to be the meek and mild type.  She is the most likeable and interesting of the three main women.  During the book, she overcomes some of her insecurity, gets over a philandering husband of 30 years and finds new love with a good man.    I found Sophia a bit irritating.  I meet her type in business everyday and I can assure you the type doesnt wear well in real life.  She overconfident, a type A, totally independent, and I wouldnt want to work with her either.  But Ms. Roberts does a credible job of dealing with the character trying to come to grips with the fact that maybe she just might need someone else in her life.    There are also several interesting secondary female characters.  Theres a trophy wife of Tony Avano (Pilars ex) whos very easy to hate.  Shes really a one dimensional gold digger type.  Theres another vicious business woman who hates Sophia and tries very hard to ruin her.  But the best of the secondary characters are Maddy, the teenage daughter of Pilars new love interest and Helen, a long time friend of Pilar.      Maddy is the daughter that everyone would like to have.  She pushes the limits, by asking to pierce her nose, when what she really wants is a second set of piercing in her ears.  She dresses in Goth, although shes really growing bored with that.  Although she pushes the limits, she never crosses them.  In addition shes incredibly smart and ambitious.  I found myself hoping that she wouldnt follow Sophia and become that totally pain in the rear I am woman type female as she grew up.    Then there was Helen.  I really wish more could have been done with her character.  She was a good friend to Pilar and unlike Pilar I got the feeling she may not have been quite as good a girl growing up.  She was obviously highly successful.  She had a stable and happy marriage, a son, and a lawyer and judge.  She played a little more earthy character to Pilars sophistication.  She was goading Pilar on buying sexy underwear and jumping her new found love interest.  Too bad she couldnt have been in the novel more from the beginning.    I have another Nora Roberts novel on my shelf.  Ill probably read it, but Ill wait a little while.

There were so many things at so many levels about this book to recommend it, that I don't feel adequate to capture them.  Yes, this is a \\"remake\\" of the Cinderella fairy tale, but that doesn't really do it justice.      One concept that is interesting is the idea that the fairy tale evolved out of real circumstances.  The book is written as a memoir after hearing children telling the tale of Cinderella.  The person then goes on to tell what really happened and is amazed that their life has become the stuff of fairy tales.  It does make you wonder if, in fact, many fairy tales are based in fact.    Another concept is the changing of the characters personalities.  In the traditional tale, Cinderella and of course the prince is good, the step-mother and two step-sisters are bad.  In the remake, Cinderella is not perfect; in fact, we find that her banishment to the kitchen is of her own volition.  The step-sisters are more complex.  One is probably just an average girl, with feelings, emotions, and the normal stuff of early adulthood.  She loves, she hates, and those emotions may be directed at the same person at different times.  The other step-sister could be described in today's terminology as challenged.  She's a mute, large, unattractive, and apparently a bit \\"slow\\".  The step-sister is a little more evil than the one in the traditional telling.  She not only persecutes Cinderella, we find that she commits murder.  But, even that is tempered by the fact that she does what she does to try and protect her children.  Well, and she is greedy and a social climber.    The book is also populated with other characters that are just as rich and complex.  There is the Master, who is one of the lesser known Dutch master painters of that era.  There's Casper, the Master's apprentice.  And there is Van den Meers.  He is the man that Margarethe (evil step-mother) marries to become the step-mother.  He is a man that is driven by his needto be accepted and driven by Margarethe to \\"keep up with the Joneses\\".    Besides that fact that the characters are changed from one-dimensional characters into truly complex multi-dimensional beings, the author explores philosophical issues like, what is true beauty?  What does motivate people?  Just a fascinating read.    My star ratings:    One star - couldn't finish the book  Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

I'd guarantee you that if you pick up another title by the same publisher, you'll find many of these plans repeated there.  True, most do have a fair amount of glass on one side, making them suitable for catching views of why you built the house there.  They have divided the plans in the categories like, lakefront, riverside, ocean, pier houses, and luxury.  The houses listed in the lakefront and riverside chapters have nothing special about them to make them \\"lakefront\\" or \\"riverside\\".  Some of the ocean houses do have more of either a Cape Cod or east coast feel, but not all.  Obviously, the pier house are as advertised and the luxury are mostly just big.  <br />If you're beginning your search and gathering starting points, this can be a good book.  Quite honestly, you'll probably have better luck if you buy a plan book concentrating more on the features you want in a house not, as this book suggests the site of the house.  If you want a one story home, buy plan books that say \\"ranch\\" or \\"one story\\" in the title, if you want a smaller or retirement home, look for \\"small\\" or \\"retirement\\" or \\"empty nester\\" in the title, if you want fewer but larger rooms, look for \\"open\\" in the title.  After you've got a book with plans with features that fit your lifestyle, then look for plans with lots of windows to admire the view from. If you're looking for something a bit more unique, spend a little more and go with some of the hardback books on the market.	2003-01-30
US	49872352	RNXN1JDGYHJYR	0517312220	927692482	Now Face to Face	Books	3	4	11	N	N	Two, two, two books in one!	It would seem that Ms. Koen really wrote 2 books here.  The 1st 420 pages of this are about Lady Barbara Devane's time in Virginia on her grandmother's tobacco plantation and the plotting of the Jacobites back in England.  The 2nd 300 or so pages are about Barbara back in England trying to get a heavy fine that had been levied against her now dead husband repealed and the continued plotting of the Jacobites.  The 2nd book within a book is better than the first.    I have not read Through a Glass Darkly, which I now know is the predecessor to this book.  The feeling I get is that at the end of that book Barbara was probably on a ship heading for Virginia and the author seemed compelled to account for her time in Virginia.  She would have been better off (in my opinion) to have started this book off with Barbara on a boat back to England and have Barbara fill us in on the people and plot points that she needed to continue the story back in England.  The Virginia portion of the book introduced lots of characters and plot lines that the moment Barbara set foot back on English soil were either dropped, or a feeble attempt was made in the 2nd half of the book to tie back in.  Ms. Koen seemed to be so preoccupied with the England portion of the story that she continued to \\"cut away\\" to the UK to give us tedious updates on the plotting by the Jacobites to over throw King George.  Maybe their character development took place in Through a Glass Darkly and I missed it.  I give the 1st book within a book about one and  stars.  I came close to not finishing the book and I scanned much of the book between pages 200 to 400.    The second book within a book picks up.  Suddenly Barbara changes from a deceitful, childish, promiscuous, shallow, spoiled brat into a human being with feelings, failings, and strengths.  The Jacobite plot continues but the characters that for the 1st 420 pages were tedious and boring now take on personalities.  At last you get a sense that the book is headed in a definite direction.  Unfortunately, this part of the book is also flawed.  You are left at the end with no sense of closure and are sure that there is a book three in the works.  This part gets about a 3, maybe 3  stars.  So on average the book is about a 3 star effort.    My star ratings:    One star - couldn't finish the book  Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

Many of his novels spend so much time with the technology of the story that I feel I'd be better off reading a college text.  But this one does not fall in that category.  It could be in part that I'm a big historical novel fan and the time travel to France in the middle ages just really caught my attention.  He has spent as much time and attention explaining what life was like as he often does explaining some arcane theory.  Now I don't know if his depiction is accurate and quite honestly, I don't care because it sounds believable and is a great read.  For those of you who read his novels for the technology, it's still there.  Although I don't pretend to understand the technology behind this theory of time travel, it adds that aura of science that Crichton has become famous for.

It lists over 150 of America's greatest homes that are open to the public.  It is organized by region of the U.S.  For each region, it list the homes by state and supplies a map of the region, marking where each of the houses are.  For each house, a one to two page description is given along with in many cases a color photograph on the property.  It also lists, the property's address, phone, opening hours, and what facilities are available at the property such as restaurant, gift shop, guided tour, etc.  It even lists the site's website so that you can get up to date information regarding opening times and admission fees.    Admittedly, it does not list every home in a area that is historic and open to the public, but it does list a very good starting point.  Enough to point you to a place that you would like to visit if you are a architecture or old classic home buff.  Once there, you can explore on your own and find the less publicized gems that appeal to you.    I have really used this book.  I have planned and completed trips to New Port, Charleston, and the James River area.  I am actively planning a trip to the Hudson River Valley because of this book and can't wait to return to New Orleans and Washington DC with this book in hand.

My husband and I have always wanted to travel on the Glacier Express and he suggested that instead of making it a two day event in a week long trip, that we make traveling the train the whole trip.  I didnt see how we could turn an 8 hour train trip into a week of vacation.  Fortunately, I found this book.<br />It starts as many guide books do with the essential travel information.  It give you average temperatures and rainfall for given time of the year, the electricity requirements, customs, etc., etc. <br />The second section of the book is concerned with traveling by train.  The third gives a country by country breakdown of travel hints, again it lists consulates and valuable tourist info.<br />But the real value of this book is the next section.  It lists all the really great train journeys through the Alps.  The wonderful thing about this book is that it covers the Alps, not just Switzerland.  So not only to you get descriptions of the Swiss rail trips, but you also get descriptions of trips that go across country boundaries.  So this book covers, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland.  For each route, the book supplies you with the route, where to change trains, the time of travel, places to stay, places to eat and places to see.  The places to stay, eat and see may need a little supplementation from another source, but the route info itself is worth the price of admission.	2002-12-26

The base of the story is that a woman who died 400 years ago is linked to two families.  She feels that these two families betrayed her and she's still out to get them.  The story mixes modern world with the story of this woman from 400 years in the past.  Meanwhile, in modern times, you've got a pretty scary ghost story going on.  The story itself is highly entertaining, as long as you don't pay attention to the details.  Think of it as that highly entertaining, but critically unaclaimed movie that you watch just for fun.  If you get caught up in the details that just aren't right, then make a game of it, because otherwise, it will make you crazy.  <br />When I say it needs proofing, I'm not kidding.  There are places where a man is described as wearing a black coat and then two pages latter it's blue.  She describes a young boy as having polio.  Now this takes place in modern times and this child is less than ten years old.  To my knowledge, a case of polio hasn't been reported in Western Europe in the last 10 or 20 years, so that's just totally bogus!!  And then there was my favorite proofing error, \\"She hid her hands behind her face.\\"  I'm not sure this is anatomically possible.<br />Ms. Joyce needs to get a thesaurus to try and cure her overuse of the word gaze.  She loves this word, both as a noun and a verb and in one nights reading, I kept track.  The longest Ms. Joyce could go without using some variation of this beloved word was two pages.  <br />If you want a fun read, go for it.  But don't be looking for literary excellence.	2002-12-26

The premise is that there are human like beings that have lived under the surface of the earth for longer than man's recorded history.  They have come up to the surface on occasion and become the stuff of human legend.  Now, we have discovered the sub planet and everyone has something they want from it.  There's a corporation that wants to exploit it, a group that feels that it harbors Satan, and the military want do dominate it for military reasons, of course.<br />This new/old world is vividly developed by Mr. Long.  Mr. Long reminds me a bit of Crichton without quite as much explanation of science.  I know a book is well written, when as I'm reading I can visualize what the scene must look like.  Mr. Long has done just that.  In addition, the characters seem believable with a little suspension of disbelief.  The human characters do seem to not be real people but more of a distillation of certain traits that Mr. Long what's to bring out.<br />Great book if you enjoy, adventure, or sci-fi.	2002-12-26

These are always my 1st choice.  I guess I'm just a pretty picture addict.  But I must say that this is a well-done book.  It reminds me of the Baedeker's guides.  In fact it's set up very similarly.  The front section has information about Switzerland, history, famous people, plants, animals, etc.  The center section contains information on places in Switzerland in alphabetical order.  The back section contains helpful travel information.  Things like traveling by plane, boat, car, train.  It contains a listing of sights, their opening times and admission charges.<br />They like Baedeker's, have a rating system for the various destinations with 3 being must see, and 1 being interesting.  Keep in mind though when using these ratings that even if somewhere is rated 3 stars doesn't mean that it will be a 3 star experience for you.  If the rating is for a modern art museum and you just \\"don't get it\\", then you probably shouldn't visit just on the strength of the book rating.<br />Another helpful feature is a map giving tours.  Unfortunately, the description of these tours leaves a little to be desired.  They could use some fleshing out.  The map is good but the written description is confusing and lacking.<br />They do list restaurants and lodging for the more major destinations, but these are limited and you'd be better off using a book dealing specifically with lodging (I'm sure Michelin would suggest their Red Guide).<br />Overall this is a good general, getting started guidebook.  Not the best, but a good second choice.	2002-12-20

Ariane just goes from one addiction to another.  1st she's a workaholic, then she gets addicted to the 1st vampire Racari.  She's obsessed, she quits work, she doesn't pay bills.  Sounds like an addiction to me.  Then she becomes obsessed/addicted to the next vampire Daniel.  Through the whole thing, she's taking drugs - more addiction.  Half way through, I quit reading the book.    Couple this fascination with the addictive personality with a writing style that formally could only be found in the magazines one found in the back of an adult toy store, and you've got a total turn-off for me!!!  Although Ms. Jefferson has a wonderful command of English, she can't seem to get through her literary effort without liberal use of four letter words describing sexual processes and organs.  Oh yea, I forgot to mention that Ariane also seems to be obsessed with sex with vampires.    Anne Rice has nothing to worry about.  Ms. Jefferson cannot develop a character with enough depth to compete.    My star ratings:    One star - couldn't finish the book  Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

It's quite entertaining for those of you who like those thick novels with lots of history, atmosphere, and background.<br />It's a well-told story of a nurse after WWII, who falls through a magical collection of standing stones into the 18th century.  There she meets the rather sinister ancestor of her 20th century husband and meets, marries and falls in love with (yes, the order is correct) an outlawed Scotsman.  We have the intrigues of 18th century Scottish politics, a romance, some wonderful characters (one of my favorites turns out to be another time traveler that ends up being burned as a witch), and just a wholly enjoyable book.<br />One thing in the novel never really rang clear to me.  If Claire was trained as a nurse during WWII, then how does she know so much about 18th century herbal medicine?	2002-12-03

It has nothing to do with the author's writing.  She tells the story from the view of our heroine, Sookie Stackhouse.  The writing is witty with lots of humorous insights into Sookie's mind.  Sookie is a cocktail waitress who can read people's thoughts and because of that is thought of by most folks as strange or in some cases a little crazy.  She becomes the boyfriend of Bill, the vampire.  Ms. Harris does a superb job of capturing the feel of a small southern town, and that's precisely why I didn't like the book.    Now I like vampire novels, I've read almost everything that Anne Rice has written, Jeanne Kalogridis writes an entertaining vampire novel, and there's nothing wrong with the original Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\".  But, I like my vampires a little more Gothic or worldly.  That's why I couldn't finish this book.  It's set in the small town, rural, not particularly sophisticated, nigh on to poor south.  No matter how well written the novel is, I just don't want to read about these people.  And Ms. Harris does an excellent job of describing that small townness.  Sookie is so like the \\"strange\\" girl that every small town seems to have.  The only difference is that Sookie is rather attractive.  In real life, they're usually plain.  There's the grandmother who belongs to some club or another that's based on being descended form a member of some group.  Reminds me of my husband's aunt who's been trying for at least 20 years to get proof so she can join the Daughters of the American Revolution.  Sookie's brother reminds me a little too much of a cousin I have that lives not too far from where this little work of fiction takes place.  Heck even the vampire has a feeling of being \\"small town\\" with a name of Bill.  Could we at least go for William?

The book contains some 15 or so chapters and hardly a one goes by where we are not subjected to a \\"steamy\\" love scene.  I consider \\"steamy\\" to be one that uses euphemisms for most anatomical parts, but not those that you'd find in the magazine you can buy at the local adult toy store.  It's kind of soft porn.  At any rate, Ms. Feehan introduces a new kind of vampire, the Carpathians.  If you've read the other reviews, you know that they are dying out, the males become depressed and turn to the more traditional vampire if they don't find their life mate, the males are extremely possessive of their women, and if one of the pair dies the other dies also.    My disappointment lies in that it is a romance novel.  Ms. Feehan introduces so many concepts, however vaguely, that if expanded, could have made for a truly interesting read.  She talks of Mikhail's home with objects that he has collected over his long life, but never tells you any more about that home, what the objects are, where they were obtained or how.  Describe the details.  Make it real for me!  Raven (the life mate) has a moment where she sees into Mikhail's thoughts and sees everything.  This \\"everything\\" is glossed over.  Tell us what's there.  How many has he killed, what are his secrets, what's his most embarrassing moment, his turn-ons, his turn-offs, who's his favorite soccer team?  Give these characters some real history and depth.  I could go on, but you get the idea.      I'd considered trying another one in the series, but after reading other reviews, it looks like Ms. Feehan has found a romantic novel formula that works for her (indicated by all the 4 & 5 star reviews) and all of them pretty much follow the same template.  Carpathian meets woman, makes her his life mate (partially against her will), then proceeds dominate the woman while the woman complains that she needs freewill.  These discussions about domination and free will usually end in a bout of sex.  There's usually a fight against some \\"bad guys\\" as a secondary plot.    So, if you want a formula romance, with a vampire twist, this is for you!    If you want an intriguing new look on the vampire legend with depth and development, steer clear.    My star ratings:    One star - couldn't finish the book  Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.  Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the author  Three stars - enjoyable read.  Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection.  Would judge other books by the author individually.  Four stars - Liked the book.  Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.  Five start - One of my all time favorites.  Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author.	2002-11-13

My husband and I spent one week of a two-week 25th anniversary trip in the Loire Valley and this book was our guide.  I love that everything is divided into regions and that you get so many pictures so that you know what you're really going to go see.  My main complaint with a lot of other guides is that you have to rely on a short written description and often when you get there, it's nothing like you expected.    There are numerous maps with the sites marked.  They also include restaurants and hotels rated by price and region.  There's a history of the region in the front of the book.    All of their guides follow the same basic format, so if you travel a lot, there's no surprises between the books.
