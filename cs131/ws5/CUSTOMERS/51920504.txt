Most of the photos are indeed artistic & in good taste but a few fall short of the best taste in my opinion; a notable example of the latter is a quite explicit close-up of oral sex on one full page plate which falls more into the category of pornography than art in my view.Being an artist who considers the unclad human form the greatest aesthetic creation of God, I am not a prude but I buy books like this with that in mind. However I don't believe in throwing out the proverbial baby with the proverbial bathwater so I am keeping my copy of this book but I do give it a very qualified recommendation.You pays your money and you takes your chance (with the option of returning it to Amazon if it is totally unacceptable for whatever reason).	2005-10-01
US	51920504	R354IN01LUVHSB	0792275438	183454692	National Geographic Atlas of the World, Eighth Edition	Books	5	89	142	N	Y	Best general atlas	I have both the 7th and 8th editions of this book, as well as recent editions of most of the other major world atlases.     In my opinion, this latest (8th) edition blows away the competition (_and_ the National Geographic's own 7th edition).    Having bought and owned world atlases for almost 50 years, I strongly recommend this atlas for home, school, or library use. I find this latest edition exceedingly accurate, especially in the areas of the Middle East (*despite* the protestations from certain _very_ organized political factions &#60;ahem&#62;).     Magnificent satellite photos, along with revised and improved political and geo-physical maps, set this one apart from the rest. Much of the &#34;supplemental&#34; map sections of the previous edition are expanded.    Regarding the reviewer who indicated that the 7th edition is &#34;cloth-bound&#34;:  well, the 7th edition (that I own) actually has a *cloth-textured* dark blue *paper* overlay on hardboard. The internal hinges are &#34;binders' mull&#34; (cloth) _but_ so are those of the plastic-coated covers of the 8th edition! Both editions should hold up very well. The main difference in the covers is the aesthetics, and the 8th edition is indeed quite pleasing in that department.    I most highly recommend the 8th edition of this atlas, and you certainly won't go wrong if you purchase it from Amazon.  A great addition to the panoply of atlases, and a huge treat for addictive map lovers!	2004-10-20
US	51920504	R1PIKJINLPBBJP	0310929962	247725551	NIV/KJV Parallel Bible, Large Print	Books	4	44	51	N	Y	No words of Christ in red & cheap binding...	This bonded-leather parallel KJV-NIV Bible disappoints this reader by not showing Christ's words in red print. My parallel KJV-Amplified Bible does indeed have Christ's words highlighted in red type and is from the very same publisher! I naturally assumed that this KJV-NIV version would do likewise. On a more positive note, the large print is _easy_ on the eyes and the burgundy bonded-leather flexible cover is quite attractive. However, I'm returning this Bible and hope to eventually find a parallel KJV-NIV with the red letter feature.          Just another observation: It is sad that this and almost all Bibles (and most other books) published today no longer have _sewn bindings_ but mere glued-in pages. This makes the books relatively fragile (open it too wide or use it too much and the spine cracks) and greatly shortens their useful life. Some very expensive tomes are bound in this manner (ironically referred to as 'perfect binding' in the book industry).	2004-07-28

This book &quot;tells it like it is&quot;.  Although the contemporary state of marriage reflects a sad 50% divorce rate, the observations and suggestions in this book might help to reverse those dismal statistics. <br />One needs to be absolutely aware and &quot;conscious&quot; before entering the holy state of marriage.  Questions to ask yourself: Are you and your loved one &quot;best friends&quot;?  Do you have common values and interests?  Do both of you consider your _commitment to your marriage_ as the most important aspect of your mutual values? Are you willing to compromise with your partner?  Have you discussed parentage? (having children places the greatest strain on a marriage.)<br />This is a fine publication, and worth your while.	2004-06-06

This small tome is well-written and quite erudite, but _desperately_ needs illustrations of the actual firearms! There is only *one* image of a specific firearm, and it is merely a  simple line-drawn schematic.

The publication is a fine read for a person of any race and most ages (10 & above). However, I feel that the last sections of the book place excessive emphasis on contemporary cultural \\"pop\\" figures, i.e., persons in show business and sports. Too many black notables in the sciences and fine arts are ignored. <br />As a previous reviewer noted, perhaps a future edition will be more balanced and will give the American Negro proper credit for invaluable contributions to our culture and society.	2004-02-22

The book, quite a large tome, is a beautiful and comprehensive cartographic overview of the world. The atlas's weakest area might be considered to be its US map section, as those maps are presented by specific regions and not by individual states. However, the latter is nit-picking since this is indeed a \\"world atlas\\" and not intended to be a road map of the USA. (Nevertheless, my 22-year-old Hammond Medallion atlas features detailed maps of individual US states (showing each county, major roads, etc) as well as the individual provinces of Canada, and a quite comprehensive world map section. Those big old Hammond atlases were better than their modern counterparts, but I digress...)<br />I also own the latest edition of the National Geographic atlas and the 2000 edition of the largest Hammond World Atlas. While the latter have their strong points, I'd rate the 11th edition Oxford as the best general-purpose world atlas, and the Amazon price is certainly right. I ordered mine \\"next day air\\" to minimize shipping damage but its good packing would probably have kept it safe even via UPS ground. However, I still recommend 1 or 2-day shipping for buyers particular about book condition--- this is a very large, heavy book!<br />Besides the excellent main map section, the Oxford has an extensive introductory section with all types of specialized maps and related data. Furthermore, the atlas's index is well-organized and extensive. The maps themselves are unusually legible and don't require squinting to find towns, rivers, etc. The book is an invaluable reference and also a work of art. A \\"must buy\\" as far as I'm concerned!	2003-12-25

This 4th edition is a valuable addition to any library (home, school, office, etc.).<br />The book is somewhat of a tome (over 2000 pages) but is indeed a &quot;user-friendly&quot; reference, featuring color illustrations all throughout the book, and presenting definitions in a clear, interesting, and concise manner.<br />Despite its superficial glitz, this is a quite serious dictionary, including copious material on word origins, history of the English language, and various other scholarly &quot;extras&quot;.<br />Besides The American Heritage Dictionary, I use Merriam-Webster's 10th &amp; 11th Collegiate Dictionaries, Merriam-Webster's Third New International(unabridged), and both the Oxford New American Dictionary and the 2-volume Oxford Shorter Dictionary of the English Language. I recommend all of these (available on Amazon) and I find that they complement each other. <br />Again, you won't go wrong in purchasing The American Heritage Dictionary, even if it is the only dictionary that you own.	2003-11-24

However, the latest compilation pales beside its 1952 counterpart which has 510 entries, compared to the 270 entries in this volume. This \\"new\\" edition has larger type and revised entries. Some of the articles/summaries are actually better than earlier versions. <br />However, none of the works of (for example) Thomas Wolfe, among others, are included in this new edition. I suppose the editors wished to keep the new volume as lean and basic as possible.

This attractive tome is a great value (highest quality binding, printing, graphics reproduction, etc) and showcases what looks like another Disney/Pixar masterpiece. I have not seen the film itself (..since it has not yet been released at this time of my review), but I thoroughly enjoyed following the book's presentation of the work, from plot conception to final rendering. The raw animation art and the stills from the film are outstanding, and allow one to get the \\"feel\\" of what the story is about.<br />In my opinion, Pixar has already captured the true Disney spirit and quality (i.e., what Walt himself demanded in his products) in the films that it has produced jointly with The Disney Company. It certainly appears, from this fine book and other sources, that \\"Finding Nemo\\" will be no exception.<br />You can purchase this book now and enjoy it, or you can wait for its upcoming Summer, 2003 release.

The book is an inspired work by a physicist who cogently explains quantum physics in a quite personal, touching manner, i.e., framing the presentation with his own individual search (based upon an early personal tragedy regarding the loss of a loved one).<br />This is exceedingly well-written and is, all by itself, a definitive introduction into the world of quantum physics.

This book manifests the proper perspective for both introducing students to physics and for refreshing those long out of college, or just anyone who wants to learn the essentials but does not have advanced math skills.<br />In this textbook for introductory physics, the author takes a wise approach by presenting the essential nuts-&amp;-bolts of physics concepts. The concepts and principles should always come before the actual applications, i.e., involving the &quot;math&quot;. Mathematics is certainly vital in physics, but any science book (or study course) needs to establish a foundation before proceeding with complex (and often confusing) calculations.<br />This publication has helped me immensely and I highly recommend it.	2003-03-05

The only complaint I have about this edition is its name; I feel it should be titled &quot;History of Art: Concise Edition&quot; as &quot;History of Art for Young People&quot; makes it sound too much like a children's book. While certainly suitable for an intelligent child, it is a superb art overview and reference for all people.<br />If you desire a general art reference you won't go wrong with this gem and you'll not find anything better. I have the 3rd edition also and it is excellent but this 6th one is greatly expanded (e.g., lots more photos and color) while retaining the user-friendly nature of the earlier editions. The text is clear and interesting, not written in the dry, boring style of a textbook. The printing and reproductions are top-quality. This art book is truly itself a masterpiece!	2003-02-27

This review pertains to the 312-page Concise Edition of the Oxford Atlas of World History with the ISBN 019521921X. The larger original edition has 352 pages and the ISBN 0195215672.<br />The book is a variation of one of the best (and perhaps *the* best) \\"atlas of world history\\" tomes. However, this scaled-down version's text is just not as easy on the eyes as that of the full-size book. The map and text content are the same for both books so the concise version is certainly a real value at about half the price. The Concise Edition does omit the glossary but I do not consider that an essential feature of the original book. The larger original version came out in 1999 (and was reprinted in 2002). The Concise Edition is merely a reprint of the 1999 book and I can find no updated data. An advantage of the Concise Edition (besides the lower price) is its physical handiness; the original is quite close in size to the big Hammond Atlas of World History. Nevertheless, I like to casually browse through atlases so the increased eye-friendliness of the larger type and map detailing in the big version is well-worth its added expense and clumsiness for my purposes.<br />The Concise Edition is indeed legible and would be OK for just occasional reference but not protracted reads, in my opinion. It is really a 5-star book but I rate it at 4 stars because of this truncated size. I am returning my Concise Edition and keeping its big brother. Both editions are still available from Amazon at the time of this writing.	2003-02-23

I give this book four stars because, while it is really not an atlas, it is a wonderful overview of history.<br />The book features the superb photography/illustrations that folks expect from National Geographic. These graphics are used to good effect, showing the progression from early history to the late 1990's. I find it a most enjoyable \\"refresher course\\" in world history. There is a timeline at the top of each page indicating significant events for the given period.<br />If you wish to have a succinct world history summary/review with great aesthetics, you can't go wrong with this. However, it offers relatively few maps (around 60 or so), so don't depend on it as a true atlas.	2003-02-20

I've always enjoyed history and it helps to have such a reference as this which presents a cogent overview of events. Certainly the book can't be all things to all people. For those areas of special interest, e.g., the Celts, one desires to obtain more in-depth sources. However, this work accomplishes what it sets out to do, to present in a mentally-digestible chronology the flow of the most significant events in Western society and to make it interesting and fun in the process. The fact that the book makes a fine general reference for home or library is an added benefit, i.e., it is not a publication to be perused just the one time. This is one of the very best history books of its kind!	2003-02-14

The panels are reproduced on cheap, pulp-like paper much smaller than the original newspaper version and with very little spine margin. The strips, of course, are printed here in black-&-white. I'd had been willing to pay ... for a large-size softcover with decent paper and the strips in color. I'd been glad to pay [more money] for the thing in hardcover. Oh, well, it's worth having like it is for the strips themselves but I can remember when a paperback book of this size and production quality sold for 50 cents at the corner drug store. I'd give it 5 stars if the physical quality of the book were in keeping with its illustrious content.	2002-12-05

However, I wish this book (actually it is a &quot;textbook&quot;) offered a key to its questions at the end of each chapter. Likewise, more visual aids would be appreciated, such as detailed graphs about inflation, prices, wages, etc during the Great Depression and other such significant eras. There are indeed some very useful and informative graphs and illustrations, but just not enough for a visually oriented person such as me.	2002-11-05

However, I also found Thomas Sowell's \\"Basic Economics\\" to be at least equally as useful (and much more concise). Thus, one should consider one's investment (cost) in relation to one's benefit from the product in question. <br />All matters considered, even though this volume is danged expensive (Why are the book companies trying to give college students such a hard time?), it is a tome worth owning for study, reference, and personal edification.	2002-10-24

This book, although focused on a narrow slice of Phi Kappa Phi chronology, is very well-written and covers, in quite a comprehensive manner, a significant portion of the history of The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi. <br />I highly recommend this publication, but I also adamantly recommend the following books as companions to the latter:<br />\\"In Pursuit of Excellence- The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi 1897-1971\\"<br />*and*<br />\\"A Century of Scholarship- A One Hundred Year History of the Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi\\"<br />(Phi Kappa Phi books can be purchased from Amazon, or, if not immediately available from Amazon, from the PKP website [...])<br />And, to obtain a proper perspective on US collegiate honor societies, I definitely recommend:<br />\\"Phi Beta Kappa in American Life- The First Two Hundred Years\\" (available from Amazon!).<br />(Phi Beta Kappa, yet still restricted to a rather limited \\"liberal arts\\" 18th century criteria, is the progenitor of all US Greek-letter college honor societies)	2002-10-24

It has all the utilitarian features necessary for a textbook but likewise has enough depth and user-friendliness for a home reference tome.<br />The only significant criticism I can offer is that, for a book in this very high price range, it should have a more durable binding. It does have full cloth-covered hardback covers *but* the page section is only \\"perfect-bound\\" (i.e., pages held together merely with glue) rather than having a sewn binding. It seems to me that a ... book should have a sewn binding! I've noticed how most books classified as \\"textbooks\\" have such very high prices yet have rather cheap bindings. It's no wonder a college education costs a small fortune these days--- the textbook price alone is enough to drive one into penury, and even then the book(s) will eventually fall apart under very heavy use.<br />Anyhow, this book is wonderfully useful in its content and for that reason I recommend it highly.	2002-10-22

I consider it a much better \\"quotations book\\" than the current (17th) edition of Bartlett's, because of its superior balance and more representative content. The organization is by author, although it does have an excellent and very extensive index, as well as a (rather small) topic-oriented content section.<br />If you need and/or enjoy \\"quote books\\" you simply must have this one.	2002-10-22

This publication is obviously a quite thought-out textbook and is well-organized in its content. However, I do _not_ recommend it as a review text for those somewhat &lt;ahem&gt; weak in mathematics. The book is loaded with graphs and equations that might thwart those former students wishing to review their macroeconomics or just desiring a good home reference for same. <br />For neophytes or those long out of college (30-years-plus in my case), I suggest a good basic &quot;principles of economics&quot; text (and maybe some remedial algebra books and/or classes) before taking on more (relatively) advanced works such as this.<br />However, the book is nevertheless interesting and actually has quite a few graphs, etc easily understandable by any reasonably intelligent person.	2002-10-22

Not every quote (or quoter) represented in the book is inspiring, or even the best choice, but the very great majority of the content of this tome is indeed worthwhile.

The book is a joy to read, not only for newcomers to the academic world of economics but as a great &quot;refresher course&quot; for those of us who've been away from the proverbial &quot;Halls of Ivy&quot; for several decades.

The Shorter Oxford Dictionary is very easy on the eyes and quite a good browsing dictionary. The micrographic Compact Oxford Dictionary is certainly more exhaustive but is a real pain in the gluteus maximus to use (e.g., the eyestrain it inflicts, even with the big magnifying glass, etc). Oxford Publishing made a big, big mistake in going from a two-volume set with four OED pages reproduced onto each page to a one-volume tome with nine OED pages reproduced onto each page when they published the second edition of the Compact Oxford Dictionary. <br />Anyhow, the Shorter Oxford is a happy compromise if you haven't the shelf space or the budget for the 20-volume OED.  However, I somehow feel that a bit too much page space is wasted in this latest edition. I realize they allowed for a lot of space between entries, margin area, etc in order for the book to be more eye-friendly, but I'd rather they'd used more of the available space to include more of the contents of the OED.<br />Nevertheless, this is an excellent reference, and certainly better than any ordinary dictionary for home, school, or office.<br />(However, I must admit I'd someday like to own the full 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary(OED))	2002-10-19

It is wonderfully user-friendly and is indeed sufficient for most home and office use. Frankly, most adult users don't really need a 30-plus volume encyclopedia, considering the available public libraries and the home access to internet encyclopedias, etc. I have the most recent copy of its closest (one-volume) competitor, The Columbia Encyclopedia. The latter has quite a few more entries (and is quite ungainly to handle too, by the way), but many of the Britannica's entries are simply more concise, comprehensive and feature illustrations, many in color.<br />The Britannica is a great reference, and an excellent and enjoyable &quot;browser&quot;.

Nevertheless, I must advise that the print in this one-volume version is somewhat hard on the eyes (the Hebrew language suffers more from this than does the Greek language, in my opinion). However, all entries are certainly readable (I suggest using a moderate power magnifying glass if you really need to study the Hebrew text... just to avoid eyestrain).<br />All things considered, this is a superb value (e.g., signature-sewn binding!).	2002-08-13

The author's knowledge of American popular music is astounding and, accordingly, he presents the material in a cogent and entertaining manner. This book is a must for lovers of pre-rock popular music (well, &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; isn't really &quot;pre-rock&quot; but its style belongs to a slightly earlier era, in my opinion). Anyhow, the book is a real page-turner and any enthusiast of classic pop music can't go wrong.	2002-08-09

The content is vast, the entries are detailed and well-written, and the range of information is amazing -- strongly concentrating on Greek and Roman lore/culture/history but not limited to only that. One could curl up by the fireside and have a great read anytime with this weighty tome. I should note that the binding quality is superior--- a _sewn_ binding, not one merely pasted together with glue--- so you don't have to worry about splitting the spine by opening the book too wide! This publication is a great value, especially in today's economy, and I highly recommend it.	2002-08-09

I use it to supplement my Chambers Etymology along with several other word histories. What it lacks in quantity it makes up in quality. The British spelling is a bit annoying at times but that is a minor gripe. The book is a wonderful &quot;browser&quot; as well as a practical reference. Overall, a must-have for any English etymology enthusiast. I was fortunate to locate a (mint) hardcover edition and I find that format much more durable and pleasing to use than a paperback.	2002-08-09
US	51920504	RMNW8G2MNUT3B	0198642245	538145316	Oxford Latin Dictionary	Books	4	28	34	N	Y	Superb, but.....	This tome (and it indeed _is_ a tome!) is a fine investment for those who are really, really deep into Latin (i.e., *very* serious scholars, translators, those pursuing a college degree in Latin, etc, etc.).  For the majority of us mortals and casual dilettantes, the fabulous Oxford Latin Dictionary is superfluous and overkill (especially considering its price), in my opinion.<br />Other publications, such as Cassell's Latin Dictionary, are excellent and are a very sufficient Latin reference for most. The latter features a great _English-Latin_ section as well!  Of course, one might also consider various other volumes (for instance, Oxford's Elementary Latin Dictionary, and any number of abridged/condensed references..). <br />If you insist on a Latin dictionary much more comprehensive than Cassell's, I suggest Oxford's \\"Lewis & Short\\" Latin dictionary. The latter has a broader scope than the OLD and is a hundred dollars cheaper, as well as being slightly more compact.<br />Again, the great Oxford Latin Dictionary is a classic work and a wonderful accomplishment but is simply not the best choice for everyone, especially Latin neophytes and those merely desiring a handy and economical home library reference.	2002-08-08

This volume is a &quot;must-have&quot; for readers, scholars, and absolutely any person interested in words and their origins/history. The book is rather heavy and thick but is otherwise extremely user-friendly and a great &quot;browser&quot; as well as an essential companion to any ordinary dictionary. <br />I should note that this edition, although a British re-publication of its famous US version, retains American spelling and keeps its focus on American sources while utilizing the best of all English references, regardless of country of origin.<br />Regarding physical quality, the book has a signature-sewn binding, meaning that it is not merely held together by glue but that its pages are actually sewn with real thread... quite a treat in today's disposable society.  Thus, with reasonable care, this tome should last a lifetime and beyond!	2002-07-31

This reference views the English language from an American  perspective (as opposed to the classic OED) and presents its 25,000-30,000 entries accordingly.<br />The book is a supreme value and you can't go wrong. This is one for scholars and browsers alike. <br />I recommend this book in the highest possible sense.	2002-07-25

This edition, in the New American Standard Version, is easy to read, although I personally prefer the elegance of the King James Version (albeit that version does contain some obsolete and obscure words). It is wonderful to be able to compare the accounts of Matthew,  Mark, Luke, and John side-by-side!  I had a similar scholarly volume during my college days but somehow it and I parted company over the years (My old edition had a _sewn_ binding. Unfortunately, this edition has glued-in pages -- but the book should endure fairly well with reasonable care).<br />You won't go wrong with this fine reference. It is certainly helpful to anyone who desires a fuller understanding and appreciation of the New Testament, especially regarding the life and sayings of Jesus.	2002-07-17

This book is a great miniature lexicon for those who need a quick and physically handy reference for Latin. It goes beyond the &quot;basics&quot; and is adequate for more advanced perusal. However, the book _is_ printed on a type of &quot;pulp paper&quot; and its pages are merely &quot;glued in&quot; (so-call &quot;perfect binding&quot;). <br />All things considered, for the money, it is a bargain and you can't go wrong.	2002-07-16

A very large and wonderful single-volume dictionary for both the casual user and the word-lover. Certainly not a British dictionary being passed off as an \\"American\\" reference, but a genuine lexicon of the American variation of the English language. I prefer it over the American Heritage Dictionary as a really scholarly and comprehensive home dictionary. It is likewise a decent choice for schools and public libraries as well. A really terrific word reference, although I could do without its attempts to be \\"politically correct\\", e.g., the photos of both Bill and Hillary Clinton. Such space could be better utilized to include additional word entries. However, considering its positives and negatives, the positives prevail, and I do indeed recommend this publication, although I hope that future editions improve upon the current volume.	2002-07-16

This edition is a bit too trendy (and, especially, too &quot;politically correct&quot; in some respects) and omits many classic quotes featured in previous editions.  I shall stay with my 15th edition and actually wish I had kept my 14th and 13th as well.  Hopefully, the earlier variations are still available in nice condition at a reasonable price. I intend to do a search for some of those earlier versions and I recommend that other serious &quot;quote book&quot; users do the same.	2002-06-29

A superb reference for the scholarly etymologist and any serious student of European languages, but certainly not an especially valuable reference for the average reader.

About the only problem I've had with the book is the British idiom of the text, (e.g., the definition of the Latin &quot;silva&quot; as 'wood' rather than 'forest' or even 'woods'....).  This is quite a minor gripe, since overall the book is superb and gently walks you through the process of learning a somewhat difficult language. <br />A compact tome but a mighty learning aid!	2002-05-31

The book presents a reasonably objective \\"warts and all\\" account of Phi Beta Kappa. This publication is certainly a cogent and comprehensive history of this society, the progenitor of all U.S. Greek-name honor organizations that followed (perhaps, most notably, Phi Kappa Phi.  Established in 1897, Phi Kappa Phi recognizes excellence in all academic areas and accordingly awards major individual grants each year, more than any other \\"honor society\\").<br />Phi Beta Kappa, beginning as a secret fraternal and literary society in 1776, officially became an \\"honor society\\" in 1898, and was/is still severely limited (in membership selection) to the narrow 18th century classic liberal arts criteria. Thus, scholars whose major (e.g., engineering, business, architecture, pharmacy, nursing, agriculture, computer science, electronics, geography, teacher education, archaeology, commercial art, & many other state-of-the-art majors & specialties) is not  strictly considered \\"liberal arts\\" (the term is becoming more blurred with each passing year) are denied PBK membership, even if they have a perfect grade-point average!  Life ain't fair, as the adage goes.<br />Nevertheless, the book itself is indeed quite a positive and revealing recollection/compendium of this liberal arts society's ups & downs. One might expect a literary history of a collegiate honor society to be tedious and boring, but that is just not the case here. This book is engrossing and interesting. In many ways, it sheds invaluable light on the broad history of all American higher education!<br />I rate this book as a \\"must buy\\" and certainly a real \\"keeper\\". It is wonderfully written, and I recommend it most highly. A worthwhile read!	2002-05-18
