This one, however, has been my favorite up to this point in the series.<br /><br />It's more adult than Harry Potter and it has some \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" pop-cult references and humor thrown in.  The stories are told at a break-neck speed as Harry falls into one catastrophe after another. In Grave Peril he's haunted by what Harry calls \\"the Nightmare.\\"  A vampire from book one is highly ticked off with Harry, and if that isn't enough, his evil fairy godmother wants to claim him for her slave.<br /><br />All in all, Harry is a sympathetic, long-suffering hero.  Michael \\"The Fist of God\\" is a good foil as Harry's friend/sidekick who is more noble in purpose than Harry himself.  I also enjoyed the introduction of the vampire Thomas into the series.<br /><br />While Harry could have been quicker piecing together the mystery, I'll cut him a break since he's busy exorcizing ghosts, eluding hell beasts, fighting off a horde of vampires, and trying to work up the nerve to tell his girlfriend that he thinks he may love her.<br /><br />If you enjoyed series like \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" on TV, there's a good chance you can enjoy the adventures of Harry Dresden.	2005-07-06

Utter and complete trash.<br />I don't care if you love the stunted adolescent Buffy/Angel twu wuv angle, the book is riddled with errors.  It would help if it appeared that Holder bothered to watch the shows after 1998. Almost consistently, Holder books she are so far removed from the characterizations of the show (not to mention the history of the show) that she makes the amateur efforts of fanfic writers look like well researched literature in comparison.<br />I wish the publishers would spare us any more of these mindless books that pander to B/A shippers but nauseate anyone who bothered to actually watch the shows (hint: the characters who were on screen bear little to no resemblance to the characters that Holder writes).  It also would help if the publishers bothered to check spelling and grammar.<br />The book is silly and stupid.  Not surprised given how silly and stupid the Holder ghost-written \\"Chosen\\" novel was(which also bore no resemblance to what was on screen. . .which is scary since it was taken from the actual scripts.  Also some of the descriptions in that one went straight into the purple prose spoof category).<br />Please, if they are going to publish Buffy novels, get someone who watched the show. . .and can write.	2004-07-08

Huh?  Does this make any sort of sense?

Two characters die and the rest of them can hardly be bothered to notice.  The infinitely self absorbed survivors want to head to the mall for shoes and Starbucks.<br />Then there's laughably bad prose: \\"In the Eqyptian tomb, more with the kissage as Angel and Buffy held each other; champions share passions others can only dream of, and their kiss could easily have moved a mountain...or sent a world straight to hell.\\"<br />A lifetime of reading romance novels didn't prepare me for  cheese like that.<br />Oh, and who can overlook...  Spike dies to save the world and Buffy thinks, \\"Cookie Dough!\\"<br />If it weren't so sad, I'd be on the floor rolling with laughter. Is this a spoof?  Could the heroine *really* look at destruction and dead allies and think \\"Cookie dough?!\\"<br />I would say this was not quite ready for print.  What was the editor thinking?  What was the publisher thinking?<br />Cookie dough.  She's a half baked cookie.  And Spike saves the world for cookies and mocha lattes.  This is ridiculous and the prose is...well...I think the \\"kiss that could move mountains\\" speaks for itself. It's purple alright.  I just can't decide whether it's eggplant or aubergine.

It's evil Spike.  Obviously the book was in the works prior to Season 5 of the show because Spike's back history is dead wrong and the story of the Slayers in no way matches up with what was shown in the episode Fool for Love.<br />The best parts of the book deal with World War II.  It's fun reading Spike's views on Nazis.  If you loved the old, evil Spike you'll enjoy the book.  If you prefer the kinder and gentler Spike of Seasons 5 and 6, this book doesn't fit not only in characterization but in character history (William the Bloody Awful Poet clearly never existed here).<br />Taken as an Alternate Universe story, it has its own version of dark fun.  But it is a darker rendering of Spike than viewers of the show have grown used to lately.	2002-01-24

The immediacy with which the events are told make it seem as though this only happened yesterday. There are times it feels more like reading a novel than reading about archeology.<br />The author deserves credit for taking history and breathing life into  it.  He seemlessly delves into King Tut's family history, the politics and  religion of Egypt, and what Carter did when he discovered the tomb while  making every subject not only accessible but interesting.  In the end  discovering what actually happened to Tut and his young wife is less  important than the sense that the reader discovered more about Egypt and  Egyptology than they knew before they began the book.	2000-02-22

The choices and the mistakes each person made, their  arrogance, heroism, and their weaknesses wrapped around an astounding  adventure that leaves me wondering whether the decision to climb Everest  means someone is more than a bit crazy.

However he whines in a truly fascinating way.  The language and the confessional tone draws you quickly into a dark and morally ambiguous world.  Perhaps most fascinating  is Louis' inability to truly grasp his own culpability.  In the end I  consider The Vampire Lestat the more exciting book, but this novel of  addiction, love, and hate puts you under its spell and keeps you there as  Louis is seduced by Lestat, Claudia, guilt, and  Armand.	2000-02-22

I don't like the female lead, and Michael wore out his welcome as well.  For myself the downfall of the Mayfair Witch series isn't in the prose which is  every bit as seductive as ever, it is that the characters became  distasteful.  While the Vampire Chronicle characters of Lestat, Louis,  Claudia, etc have a way of both attracting and repelling the reader, in the  end I found most of the characters in this series to be simply repellent.  Rice still writes in a wonderful style, but these characters worse than  left me cold-- they often disgusted me.	2000-02-22

While the story of the heroine Rhiannon seems to owe a touch of credit to Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned, she is a great heroine.  I  appreciate that unlike the usual tale this isn't about an innocent female  mortal seduced by the dark seductive vampire.  She is an ancient vampire  herself filled with arrogance, insecurity, and unrequited love.  Roland,  introduced in Twilight Phantasies is both irresistably attracted and  resistant to the love of his immortal life the tortured and mercurial  Rhiannon.  They are a memorable and unique pair.

If you read the second before the first, you miss half the fun.  I loved how Lestat started out  saying essentially that everything you knew from the first book -- if not  perhaps &quot;wrong&quot; -- was certainly biased by Louis' guilt and self  hate.  It was fun to read how Lestat's view of events differed from Louis'  as Lestat &quot;set the record straight.&quot;  Still there is so much more  to The Vampire Lestat than a simple rebuttal of Interview.  I consider  Lestat the superior book as it ponders the nature of evil and free will. A  great read.	2000-02-22

After all the fascination of The Vampire Chronicles I found The Witching Hour to be a horrible disappointment.  It's not that the book was wholly bad.  The descriptions of New Orleans were  darkly beautiful and fascinating.  The descent into the Mayfair Witch  family was chilling.  The problem was the ending.  At the end of the novel  I could be no less than disgusted.  I was left dissatisfied and quite  frankly almost angry with the characters in the book.  While the prose in  the novel is as seductive as The Vampire Chronicles there is just something  in Witching Hour that left this reader dissatisfied and slightly nauseated  by the book.  Then I made the mistake of thinking the book Lasher could  make up for the horrible ending of Witching Hour -- it didn't.  If  anything, the sequel to Witching Hour made the characters even more  unpalatable.  For myself, Rice veered off course near the end of this novel  and that mistake was enough to ruin an otherwise interesting book.	2000-02-22

I can't quite remember the  name--it was Double or Duel Deception or something like that.  The original  novels had more sponteneity but this one retained the likability and  emotional stability of the characters.  In the end it is an enjoyable  (though perhaps uninspired) read.	2000-02-21

The subject matter of the book is daunting.  The ideas in the book are challenging and at times overwhelming. However, the most astounding accomplishment of the author is how well he explains quantum physics, time,  gravity, string theory etc. in terms that even a layman can understand.  For people who truly enjoy scientific theories but aren't up to  understanding the math behind cutting edge physics, this book is great.

I realize that there is a formula involved in JAK books,  but more and more it seems to come down to formula and little else.  The  most discouraging thing wasn't that the story was predictable, it was that  the story was hollow.  I never cared for the characters.  The female lead  seemed hard and emotionally dense.  The male character... well he's  basically the same male character she puts in all of her books.  Nothing  new, nothing unique, nothing...well... nothing interesting.  This is a plot  based book with thin characters and the mystery isn't very interesting.  JAK needs to take a break and work on stretching her work.  Enough with the  business consultant/CEO story.  She's done it countless times and there is  nothing new there.  Perhaps a new genre-- Western?  Espionage?  SOMETHING.  The way it is now, if you've read any of her other books you've read this  one.  This is simply a tired retelling of her old stories that isn't very  romantic, emotional, or interesting.	2000-02-21

There was nothing all that great in the characterizations of Mulder and Scully in the novel.  Nothing that stood  out in my mind as being dead on characterizations of them, however the plot  is interesting and appropriately conspiracy-esque.  It has the elements of  a solid &quot;monster&quot; episode, but I'm still left wanting more.  It  would be great if someone connected to the show would pen a novel Chris  Carter or Darren Morgan would be great(at least Morgan would bring the  twisted humor into the writing).  And I agree with a reviewer that a Gibson  book would be outstanding.  Still this book is solid in the  monster/conspiracy category though lacking in Mulder and Scully  characterizations.	2000-02-21

I've read and enjoyed several Coulter books but this last book was completely pointless.<br />The whole plot about searching for the lamp seemed a stupid and pointless afterthought.  Truthfully I wondered if the  characters had nothing better to do than waste their (and the reader's)  time on something so wholly unimportant.<br />The &quot;hero&quot;--while not  as offensive as some of the bride trilogy heroes--was insipid.  There  wasn't any substance to him.  And though I give credit that the heroine  isn't the typical simpering virgin-type she seemed to have an aimless  existence. However, to be truthful I can't complain much about the  characters. There isn't much to the characters--period.  In fact there  isn't much to the novel.  Period.<br />If you removed the sex scenes, there  wouldn't be a novel (and the book's size would decrease by half.) And,  sadly, after a while even the erotica is redundant.  After the third wham  bam thank you ma'am performance in as many chapters I started wondering  what was the point of the novel, then quickly concluded the sex WAS the  point.  The only point.<br />Better examples of Coulter's work would be The  Maze, The Nightengale Legacy, the Magic trilogy, or some of her earlier  novels.  This one is little more than love scenes strung together with a  shoe string excuse of a plot with anvil over the head innuendoes about the  &quot;big&quot; heroine being a dominatrix...though I suppose that's better  than some of the near rapes featured in the Bride trilogy books.	2000-02-21

The culture clash between the the Acadians and the pre-Civil War Southern society made a nice twist for the rich girl/guy from  the wrong side of the street plot device.<br />The hero is ambitious but  with a good heart.  The heroine begins as naive but is always treated as an  intelligent and caring person.  This isn't a story where the hero and  heroine are constantly at each others throats (though they are often at  cross purposes.)  It is clear early on that they care deeply for each other  and--suprisingly for some romances--they also manage to treat one another  as though they care.<br />Though they have their share of problems (not the  least of which is family and culture) their hearts are always in the right  place and with each other.  When the book was over, I still had a smile on  my face.  The characters and their circumstances are nicely developed and  fleshed out.  Very enjoyable.	1999-12-07

Okay it's a bit of a stretch short of an allergy or alcoholism that she would black out with very little alcohol and the architectural/interior design firm stuff is ridiculous (though perhaps  with my being an architect I'm being overly critical in that respect.  I  just found that part to be seriously off base, and no one should take the  characters' coversations about their jobs as being realistic.)  Still the  characters themselves and their approach to their problems more than make  up for the previously mentioned short comings.

I found the book as a whole quite fun with a delightful hero and heroine.  I always enjoy a hero who is more than the  stereotypical brooding he-man with too much brawn and misery for the author  to bother to make him charming or likable.  Jack is likable.  Though he has  moods he isn't some relentlessly dark and brooding male.<br />Jack is a turn  of the century anthropologist trying to debunk late Victorian academic  fashion (and truthfully a rather racist belief) that Mayan and Aztec  societies would have had to have been founded on Western cultures believing  that &quot;native&quot; cultures would be too backward to develop so  extensively on their own.<br />Sophie is a woman bounded by the era within  which she lives. While she dreams of adventure and higher education, she  was raised to be nothing more that a decorative wife and mother whose  intellect and ambitions not only need not be taken seriously but are not  expected to exist at all.  When Sophia discovers her philandering fiance  (Jack's rival in research)is simply using her and her father for grant  money for his so-called &quot;research expedition,&quot; Sophie is suddenly  liberated and off on an adventure (and a little revenge since she is  determined to dump her fiance in person. . .even if it means venturing to  Belize to do so).<br />I found Jack to be likable, believable, and charming,  and I liked Sophie.  While I can quibble that I would have preferred more  development on Jack's past, his theories, and his history with Sophie's  ex-fiance not to mention an explanation for Sophie's seeming blind spot  near the end when she cannot understand why Jack is upset about her  upcoming reunion of her fiance (the author never gave what I thought was a  reasonable explanation for an otherwise bright heroine to be so  inexplicably unobservant) the book as a whole still worked for me.<br />I  always find it preferable when you can imagine the characters liking each  other as well as falling in love with each other, and Sophie and Jack seem  to have that aspect to their romance.  They could easily be friends, and  with their shared intersts it's possible to envision a &quot;happily ever  after&quot; for the two of them.<br />I thought the book was quite enjoyable  as a whole.	1999-12-07

Oliver instead creates a sympathetic heroine who truly wants to do the right thing...once  she figures out what the &quot;right thing&quot; is, and who--unlike many  Regency heroines -- seems to have more to worry about than what to wear to  her next ball.<br />Usually a hero who deliberately sets out to destroy the  heroine's happiness is an arrogant, conceited jerk.  Oliver's hero isn't  the typical Regency rake concerned only with his egocentric indulgences but  is a thoughtful-- if misguided -- man who also wants only what's best for  everyone involved in a messy situation.<br />I found that despite a set-up  that would have had me suspecting a silly heroine and an obnoxious hero,  Oliver exceeded expectations and created two likable, caring people who  deserve happiness... if only they can figure out a way to grab it.  The  author did an excellent job fleshing out characters with strengths and  weaknesses that compliment each other so well that when the couple finally  achieves the happiness they deserve you can only finish reading the book  with a smile.	1999-12-01

I cannot put my finger on exactly WHAT is missing, I just know that I was left with a nagging impression that something was.  The book is competent but it seems a bit hollow.  Perhaps the problem is the story is more  infatuated with plot than with the characters.

How strange to order a book with the title &quot;Libby's London Merchant&quot; only to discover that of all the things the story is about a merchant isn't one of them.<br />I always enjoy Kelly's books because there  tends to be an earthiness to them that is rare in Regency novels.  She  doesn't favor dissolute rakes and &quot;diamonds of the first water.&quot;  What I found delightful in this book is how she took standard Regency plot  and decided to take it somewhere you don't suspect.<br />It opens with the  requisite titled aristocrat who poses as a London merchant (hence the  title) who when stranded in the country with an attractive &quot;country  miss&quot; (standard plot so far, huh?) then falls for the girl and wants  to marry her (still pretty standard).  When he discovers her less than fine  lineage he then makes a less honorable proposal-- which the heroine  promptly turns down (still know this plot).  The interesting thing is all  the while there is a secondary character, a likeable but comedic secondary  character that has been infatuated with Libby all along-- a simple country  doctor.  As you go through the novel where standard Regency romance plot  devices are dropped into the plot as required the devices are slowly,  deftly made insignificant.<br />It was a nice read.	1999-06-13

I enjoyed the characters and more importantly **liked** the characters.  The hero has been disappointed by his first marriage having realized that though he married for love (or more exactly  for infatuation) he and his lovely first wife were complete opposites with  little or nothing in common.  Determined to not make the same mistake twice  he sees the quiet Jane as the perfect companion for the country life with  his daughters that he wishes to lead.  It's all very practical.  Jane on  the other hand has been quite infatuated with the handsome, titled  nobleman, but she has a good head on her shoulders and a good heart.  When  he proposes and speaks of little but duty and comfort she realizes that in  her heart that could never be enough.  Stunning the hero (and herself), she  tells him no.  She could never accept a marriage of convenience.<br />I  enjoyed the way the author looked at love and took in its facets.  Infatuation exists in the novel but it isn't mistaken for love.  Neither is  comfort an adequate substitute.  When the lovers finally find one another  you feel that they both know what real love is and that they truly love one  another.  A nice read.	1999-04-24

While it clearly says on the cover &quot;inspired by The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; that doesn't quite cover it.  Perhaps it should say &quot;insipid copy of Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. . .but not  bothered with all that character development stuff.  It's not that the hero  isn't likable or that the heroine isn't likable, it's that the whole book  is predictable.  The story takes the well worn path without finding any new  bumps in the road.  I don't mind following formula, but I would like some  interesting twists of character, turns of phrase, or just my fair share of  delicious scenes.  This book just didn't deliver that.  It's not that the  book is bad (it's not that original) it's just I've read it before, and  I'll read it again -- better.  All in all, I found this one very  forgetable.	1999-03-19

I really liked the practical hero and heroine.  The hero was &quot;born on the wrong side of the blanket&quot; and though his father  didn't reject him out of hand, he had anything but a happy childhood.  Sent  to sea as a child, the adult man is now looking for the only thing he never  had--a home.<br />Lady Meg's father's death leaves her in relatively dire  circumstances.  She's bankrupt and in that day and age her options are  limited.  After turning down the proposal of a perfectly eligible neighbor,  the neighbor turns matchmaker.  Though James (the hero) is uneligible the  neighbor just has a felling that James and Meg will suit one another  perfectly--and of course he's right.<br />I enjoyed the way the character's  dilemmas are treated in a rational manner instead of resorting to  melodrama.  The earthiness and pragmatism of the characters made their  falling in love all the sweeter.  An impressive effort on Martha  Schroeder's part.	1999-01-24

While this book contains many of  the elements that made &quot;Lady Meg&quot; such an enjoyable read,  &quot;Guarding An Angel&quot; is not as well developed or well rounded.

That is why  she is one of my favorite authors no matter what her pseudonym.  However  reading &quot;With This Ring&quot; immediately after reading her nom de  plume's &quot;Orchid&quot; I began to wonder if Jayne was writing the books  in tandem. &quot;With This Ring's&quot; plot seems very similar to  &quot;Orchid&quot; (albeit &quot;Orchid&quot; is science fiction) complete  with both heroine's being horror novelists and both hero's being men of  dark reputations.<br />Still, similarities to &quot;Orchid&quot; aside,  &quot;With This Ring&quot; is a fun read with a nice change of pace of  having a hero and heroine over the age of 30.  If you are an Amanda Quick  fan, you should enjoy the book. If you are an Amanda Quick fan who reads  all of her various nom de plumes, you will most probably recognize the  plot.	1998-12-31

While Charles is a beleaguered hero I found him to be missing much of the charm that had made his brother endearing in &quot;The Wild  One.&quot; While the set up of Charles' fiance and child made a great  obstacle to be used in this story, it seemed to be underdeveloped  and  unrealistically resolved.  I was expecting a sequel that would explore the  problems created in the first novel and instead was left feeling that the  author took the easy (and unsatisfying) way out.  This didn't seem to me to  be the best work Harmon has done.  Too much of the central family conflict  in England seemed to be disposed of at whim.	1998-12-31

I read the book once years ago and disliked it.  I ran across it in the bookshelves and had  forgotten the plot.  I re-read it. . .and I still found myself concluding  that the misogynist hero was unlikeable.  I never got the feeling he  deserved the heroine and was unsure as to why she ever forgave him for the  way he had treated her.  If I were choosing a Catherine Coulter novel that  I enjoyed reading, I would avoid the entire &quot;Bride&quot; trilogy  (which had a tendency to use marital rape as a plot device-- an unfortunate  Coulter tendency).  My favorite Coulter romance is perhaps &quot;The  Nightengale Legacy,&quot; and I enjoyed her mystery &quot;The Maze&quot; as  well.	1998-12-31

Add in a difficult pregnancy and a long lost  suitor determined to free her from the strict rules of English society, and  Tracey's marriage is poised to fall apart.<br />It's a tale of a totally  unsuited couple that find that not only do opposites attract, they can even  survive once the honeymoon is over.	1998-12-31

Both marriages are abyssmal failures until Mark and Laura are  mercifully widowed. In steps Mark's aunt and Laura's godmother Lady Maria  who first manages to make Laura the surrogate mother for Mark's orphaned  son, then later suggests that for the boy's sake it would be best if Mark  simply married Laura.  Needless to say--given their pasts--neither Mark or  Laura are eager for marriage, but once they agree they find themselves  surprisingly well suited.<br />Despite their happiness, rumors abound that  Mark was responsible for his first wife's death and so when soon after  their marriage Laura begins having suspicious accidents, society begins to  gossip that he is trying to rid himself of his second wife as well.<br />It's  a fairly normal Regency/Gothic plot to have a heroine marry a hero with a  bad reputation and then find herself wandering through the second half of  the novel attempting to decide if her husband is trying to kill her.  Thankfully, Wolf avoided that plot and instead took the delightful turn of  the heroine wising up to the fact that someone is setting her husband up to  look like a killer thereby allowing Laura and Mark to stand together.  The  couple then sets out to solve the mystery of who is the true villian and  why he wants her dead and Mark blamed for it.<br />Some nice non-standard  twists in the plot and a likable and intelligent hero and heroine make this  an enjoyable romance.  A good read.	1998-12-31

The way the author set the story in a country manor and had the story stay there reminded me of a Jane Austen's work.  For a reason I can't quite name, the hero and heroine reminded me of  the characters in Austen's &quot;Persuasion.&quot; <br />Lady Meg is  relentlessly practical so when she finds herself penniless after her  father's death, she is willing to do anything (within reason) to keep her  home.  The hero was born on the wrong side of the blanket and all but  rejected by his family. Now he wants only to find a home that he can truly  call his.
