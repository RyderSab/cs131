The nearly miniscule cookbook has few really mouthwatering recipies, and if you are not familiar with Jewish traditions, you're going to be totally lost.  And amazingly (especially for a Hippocrene book), there are NO explainations about the origins of the dishes.   <br /> <br />So what can you find here?  There are some decent sounding dishes, but overall, there is not that much that really grabs my tongue.  And where can I find smoked goose in the USA?  HUH?!  Then there is the utterly idiotic recipie for a \\"TV dinner,\\" which is little more that cold cuts and ketchup.  This is tripe, pure and simple drivel disguised as a cookbook. <br /> <br />Israel does offer quite a good deal of good cooking, and it's quite a surprise that this cookbook has somehow been so little in substance and taste.  Buy a different Israeli cookbook, or if you're looking for Middle Eastern cookbooks, check out Nasrallah's Delights from the Garden of Eden, which is hands down the best Middle Eastern cookbook every produced.	2005-09-11

He explores a number of different themes, often focusing on his personal experiances and emotions.  To those of us who have suffered in life, one can easily relate to a lot of the feelings he felt.  There are many hidden messages in the poetry, and the language is very rich and educated.  You can get a lot of different interpretations out of these poems, which make them all the more relevant to the reader.<BR>The best thing about this book is the fact that it features both the original French and an English translation, side by side.  For those who are fluent or well versed in French, this is a dream come true.  The translations are expertly done, and great care has been done to preserve the rhyme schemes without losing the meaning of the poems.	2004-02-09

It's very well written, and the characters are all vibrant and lively (despite the fact that this book is called &quot;Ghost Soldiers&quot;).  <BR>The beginning starts off quick, with the description of a massacre in a Japanese POW camp, but then it slows down a bit.  THis doesn't last long, and the writer carefully intersperces bits about the organization of the rescue mission with descriptions of daily camp life.  <BR>I couldn't put this book down once it came to the moments of the resuce mission.  The ending was a bit anti-climatic, because everything works out well, but it definately ends on a high note.  Especially interesting is the ending where it outlines what happened to each of the main characters in the book, including the Japanese POW camp guards.<BR>When you read this, it's no doubt that our great country possesses some of the best soldiers on the planet.	2004-01-12
US	52346386	RYXKULYW1NVF4	0312422156	298109609	Middlesex: A Novel	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Amazing story, amazing writer	If you had any doubts that Eugenides was a fantastic writer (certainly one of the best of our time) after reading The Virgin Suicides, Middlesex will thouroughly convince you.  To paraphrase what one critic wrote of his work, this man makes the ordinary into something extraordinary.  The story is so bizarre, but at the same time, very much possible, and in fact, with all the real events put into the work, it seems almost impossible that this is actually fiction.<BR>One of the most fantastic aspects of Eugenides' style is his attention to subtlety.  When you read the book the first time, you will notice small, mysterious passages that foreshadow events that will happen later in the book.  When you go back and read these the second time, it will all make sense.  Another aspect of his subtlety is his way with words, in describing things without being point blank about it.  I really enjoy this, because it lets your mind create something unique.  His expertise in describing the feelings and thoughts of Cal, the main character, is an especially difficult undertaking, because Eugenides had to write in the place of a man, a girl, and someone who is in a gender identity crisis.  I don't know how he was able to do this, but for some reason, it all seems so real.  <BR>The character development is excellent.  I think that one of the things about all of his characters, in Middlesex as well as the Virgin Suicides, is that you become very interested in them, and you care about what happens to them.  Descriptions of scenery are excellent as well, whether it's the smoggy, dirty car factory in Detroit, or a beautiful beach in Petosky.  It feels like you are right there, in that very place.  The plot all ties in together, and nothing is just there for entertainment.  The historical scenes were well researched, from the problems in Detroit to the problems of Greeks living in the middle of a war.  All these important world events pass by in a fashion that seems a bit like Forrest Gump.All in all, it's very rich and enjoyable.  A true masterpiece.  Hopefully we won't have to wait nine years before his next book!	2003-12-18

I can inarguably say that the book is much better than the movie, which I also loved, but this book just blows me away.<BR>The writing style is very straight forward, littered with slang, and raw, adolescent emotion.  <BR>What can I say about this?  It sucks you in, and you get an entirely different view of the girls than in the movie.  There are no places to place blame, but still at the end, you feel a profound sense of sorrow for their tragic deaths.  The author magnificently captures the atmosphere and emotion of a dying suburb, the visions of a decadent lifestyle coming to an end, all brought about (as it would seem) by the deaths of these girls.  <BR>I can't say that this is on par with classic authors, but for a modern writer, I can safely say that Eugenides has created a true masterpiece.  This is DEFINATELY NOT just some teenage novel riddled with cliches--it's a true play on emotions and captures what is going on perfectly.  Perhaps in time, it will give the glimpse of an extraordinary (and very tragic) story set in the USA of the 70's.	2003-11-26

This book proceeds in a good, logical manner, with plenty of attention to each different subject.  The dialogues are useful, and are not ridiculously difficult to learn.  The alphabet is explained very well.  Overall, it's a very useful and enjoyable intro to Farsi.<br />There are three problems with this book: the text size is VERY small, making it very difficult to see how the letters are formed.  Secondly, the organization of the vocabulary before each text does not proceed logically, nor does it include the appropriate words for the lesson.  Finally, the language presented here is the formal, written language, and spoken Farsi really varies drastically from this.  (For example, most Persians cut some syllables out of words)	2003-11-24

This is a highly useful book for the new initiates into the Thelemic system of Magick.  For some people, it's difficult to grasp all of Crowley's concepts, so this little manual is highly reccommended.  Even I, a recent initiate to the Thelemic system, have found it very useful even though I usually understand Crowley's ideas.

There are only about half a dozen of them, and they require quite a bit of effort on your behalf.  One calls for making a model head.  Another calls for creating a ring with silver and bronze.  Another is making a pendant.  If you're not a real hardcore magick practioner, this is going to require a bit more effort than you're used to.  On a good note, these are intense rituals, and quite interesting.  The problem is that this book usually goes for a steep price.  Most of it is various stories or commentaries written by the editor about various old cults and stuff like that.  He connects Lovecraft and Crowley to weird theories and history, which is fun to read, but not worth the price.  Also, you can find the spells online, so this might be a complete waste of your time and money if you're just looking for those.	2003-05-12

The second half contains several of the most important magickal rituals of Thelema, the most important being the Star Ruby banishing.  If you are interested in the Occult at all, or are a magick practioner, GET THIS BOOK.  You will not regret it.

Apart from that, what really makes this an interesting read is the way that the narrator sort of looks at life in a concentration camp rather non chalantly.  There's a great variety of different emotions being presented here.  He gets bored, tired, lonely, and angry, all while telling of the horrors of the camp as a sort of backing.  The perspective really makes it interesting, and its small, and written in an easy to read manner.  You could read this in about two hours if you really tried.

As someone intensely interested in Inanna, as well as the ancient Sumerian gods and religeon, this book was exactly what I needed to better understand some of the most important concepts.<BR>Three complete poems of Enheduanna are represented here, and just the first one, \\"Inanna and Mount Ebih,\\" is well worth the price of this book alone.  There are many other small poems, little titbits of the ancient Sumerian hymns, which are equally enlightening.  The translations, as well as the original texts are beautifully done, reading easily as poetry.  If you like goddesses and you like poetry, this is a good thing to check out!<BR>I already own \\"Inanna: Queen of Heaven and of Earth,\\" by Wolkstein, so I am well familiar to Inanna as a goddess of love and warmth.  The texts contained in this book are the exact opposite; many show the violent side of Inanna.  But this is exactly what is important, because Inanna is a goddess of duality, that symbolizes at many time's man's ancient connection with the spirit and his natural instincts.  In ancient Mesopotamia, gods were often feared for their great powers, and harshness upon those that wronged them.  Its great to have a new point of view, especially one that is as powerful as this.  For the serious student, I'd reccomend getting both books, that way you can have a really clear picture of the glory of Inanna.  <BR>The author spends a lot of time giving information about the ancient Sumerian customs, which I find to be very useful.  For example, the Sumerian marriage rite, which I had never known much about.<BR>Now, I do have one complaint about this book.  The author tends to include WAY too many references to the Bible, as well as a really strong feminist view point.  While this is in fact interesting at times, its taken to the extreme in several places, such as at the end of \\"Inanna and Mount Ebih.\\"  I would say that for those of you that dig gender studies, you'll find it enlightening, but I would have preferred to see moreinformation on the ancient Sumerian way of life.  Oh well. <BR>Highly reccommended.	2003-03-28

I also have \\"Inanna: Lady of the Largest Heart,\\" which I would highly reccommend in addition to this book for those who want to learn more about Inanna and Sumeria.  <BR>This is mostly a collection of short hymns to Inanna, and show her gentle side.  Some of the hymns are rather explicit in their descriptions of sex, something kind of out of character for a goddess of love (and of war, let's not forget!).  A lot of the poems are really heartwarming, for lack of a better term.  I'd actually read some of these to my girlfriend for \\"romantic poetry,\\" and we both enjoyed them (even though she isn't really into the Sumerian stuff).<BR>There are a lot of copies of the ancient Sumerian tablets and images of Inanna, which will really help you get a clear picture of her.  <BR>The second half of the book is information about Inanna and Sumeria, not exactly really interesting for me, but well written.  This would be the best book to pick up for those interested in Inanna, then check out \\"Lady of the Largest Heart.\\"	2003-03-28

She uses the example of the rescuer and the victim, where we should not be victims of others or spend our time always helping others out.  So what exactly IS the answer?

With a little knowledge or Soviet history, you can easily see why this book was banned by Stalinist authorities and kept Bulgakov under high tension.<BR>&quot;Master and Margarita&quot; is about purges in the Soviet system, but its not done by Stalinist authorities; instead its done by Satan himself, and a slew of absolutely bizarre cohorts that includes a huge talking cat.  If you aren't familiar with the purges, you will miss out on the greater meaning of the book, but the story is so bizarre, compelling, and humorous that you'll find yourself eager to find out what is going to happen.  <BR>Lots of my Russian friends absolutely love this book, and kept pestering me to read it.  Bulgakov is almost the Soviet version of Dostoevsky in the sense that he treats real problems with an amusing story with the serious subject matter lurking behind the storyline.  It would definatly help if this book was read in a class, or at least with a guide, because it will reveal Bulgakov's mastery in the literature of oppression.	2003-02-25

He's a great person who enjoys the simple life first and foremost, but just happens to also be a talented writer and Russian professor at a highly esteemed university.   What's more is that I totally love the outdoors and everything associated with it as well as \\"the good ol' days\\" when development in Wisconsin was scarce, so this book speaks especially to me.  But that's no reason to ignore the fantastic stories he recounts in this book.<BR>The stories tend to be short, so you can read them one at a time and get a good impression of the thrills and frustrations of the hunt.  There's a good amount of emphasis on the good, quiet life in Wisconsin, and a real appreciation of nature, all told subtly alongside the real stories.  It conveys a sense of appreciation that I think even a city dweller would understand.  Finally, Hunting the Edges makes you feel the cold of an early November morning in the woods, or smell the griddle in the cabin right before you set out for the daily hunt.  <BR>What makes this book really fun to read is Dick's humor.  His mishaps in missing out on a choice buck due to plumbing problems in his house, a friend's failed endeavour in falconing, or failing to catch a fish during an expedition with a fellow professor (who happens to practically hold a masters degree in the art of fishing as well as Russian History) reflect his easy going nature and positive attitude.  I found myself cracking up on many an occasion while reading this book.  <BR>If you've got an interest in hunting and fishing, this book is definatly a good choice.  I'd even reccomend it to nature lovers, and go as far as to have people who regard hunting as wrong read it, because Dick hunts without all the macho city slicker attitude.  For me, this is what real hunting is all about.	2003-02-25

It was such a quick, compelling read, with so much going on that you feel like you are running through a sandstorm.  I have NEVER read a description of an insane mind as well written as this.  Poe, Lovecraft, and Dostoeyevsky, I would say, have written excellent descriptions of insane minds, but this is by far the best.  By the way, Lovecraft and Dostoyevsky are my two favorite authors.  <BR>The passage where the narrator describes his dream woman as an angel, and describes the beauty of her eyes is definatly the most beautiful passage I have ever read.  Likewise, his descriptions of the more gruesome scenes are really quite disgusting.  <BR>Hedayat really wrote a masterpiece here.  I would highly reccomend it to people who enjoy the authors I have previously mentioned.  Its a great book, with so many layers, and so many different ways to interpret what's going on.

When I went to Russia, I had a very hard time remembering slang, and especially figuring it out at times.  If I had only bought this book before my trip!  Since I was communicating mainly with young people of the Zaural region of Russia, they didn't use as much of the a la mode slang of Moscow or Petersburg.  The author gives ample explanations of the words, where they come from, their level of vulgarity, and what they normally mean.

Luckily, they provide the original cyrillic script alongside of the phonetic transcriptions, so you can actually read things while inside the country (unlike their Central Asian phrasebook, which was entirely in phonetic transcription).  I haven't been to Mongolia yet, but this book is definatly coming with me when I go!  Its content is very similar to their Russian phrasebook, which I found extremely useful while in Russia.	2003-02-09

The recipies in this book are very straight forward and surprisingly easy to prepare.  It seems to me that a great deal of effort was put into preparing the book because it has extensive cultural notes about the recipies and the country itself.  <BR>The only gripe I have about the book is that the cover tends to bend outwards really easily and stay bent, but that doesn't subtract from the enjoyment of book.	2003-01-13

This guide book may lack the extensive lists of hotels and restaurants that Lonely Planet guides have, but for someone who is curious about travelling to Persia, this is a great idea.  There are some nice photos, information on how to get there, and a good amount of cultural notes.  While some of the material is probably outdated, its a great book for those who are interested in Iran.	2002-09-13

The description of the labor camps and everyday life in North Korea is the most shocking part of the whole book.  It sounds just like Stalin's Soviet Union, and maybe worse.  The persecution of Christians in North Korea represents just a small part of what's going on there...I wonder if its the same for all people who are &quot;different&quot; that live in that country.  Unfortuanatly, its hard to tell if ALL the information is true, as is the case with any sort of book on a rogue nation.  Hardly any of us have visited these countries, and even those who have have been limited in what they see.  Luckily, they do provide a good deal of information from defectors and other people who have left North Korea.  Pretty frightening material...	2001-08-20

If you use your mind and beleive in the powers of this book, you can get many great things out of it.  Its very difficult to talk about this book, but I'll just say that its a very, very interesting book at the least.  Just be careful of how you use it!	2001-08-20
US	52346386	R1NRXYGMZFF7PC	0380731126	473230623	Necronomicon Spellbook	Books	4	1	4	N	N	Very useful, but a little lacking	This book is highly useful for working the fifty names in the Necronomicon, and it provides a bit of useful information on the invocation.  However, its too bad that they only included the fifty names (with simple explainations that really help you understand the concept behind each name), because the book is rather small, and price seems kind of steep.  For anyone highly interested in the Necronomicon, and not very knowledgable in magic, this is an excellent place to start.	2001-08-20

I personally like &quot;Polar Star&quot; better than this, but this book is also great.  A great suspense novel.  Everything only gets revealed only in the end.	1999-01-13

Every recipie is explained well, so they aren't as difficult as they look.  There's also some sections about regional cuisines of the former Soviet Union, which I find to be highly  informative.  I would have like to see some pictures, but perfection is  hard to come by.	1999-01-11

Its too bad that they didn't explain some of the grammatical aspects.  All in all, this book is well worth it if you want to study  Icelandic.	1998-12-12
