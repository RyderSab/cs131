But he never makes his case; instead, he rants and raves about presidential actions he dislikes while ignoring those which contradict his view. <br /> <br />For example, he argues that presidents before Polk all followed to the letter the Constitution's grant of declaring war to Congress - no unilateral presidential war-making.  But in fact, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both undertook military actions without the consent of Congress.  Is there a difference between those small wars and others? Irons never tells us. <br /> <br />Irons doesn't uncover anything new or make any original arguments.  Don't buy it.	2005-09-20

Perhaps there is some evidence he does not cite for thinking that it goes back to an individual right to bear arms, but as conceived by those who wrote it, the Second Amendment was clearly intended to protect the rights of state militias. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this issue, scholar and lay reader alike.	2005-09-11

His \\"heresthetic art\\" essentially means that politicians structure the choices available to suit their desires and preffered outcomes.  While this should not shock anyone, Riker does provide examples where politicians did this that may surprise those unfamiliar with the legislative process. <br /> <br />This book has limited applicability, however, due to its rational-choice assumptions.  Riker assumed that people will react rationally to the choices they are presented with; however, knowing that some politicians are trying to manipulate the system, won't others try and do the same thing?  What prevents them from succeeding; or, in other words, why do some people win while others lose?   <br /> <br />Riker can't explain many political outcomes in which both sides act strategically to suit their own goals.  He leaves out the crucial role that institutions play in shaping political outcomes, and thus his analysis is incomplete.	2005-04-20

Friedman approaches every issue from the perspective that government is everywhere and always the cause of problems, not the solution.  While I sympathize with this perspective, he takes it a bit too far in some cases. <br /> <br />For example, Friedman doesn't believe in the Food and Drug Administration.  He considers it an unwarranted intrusion in the market, arguing that instead people will avoid buying products that may be unsafe or unsanitary.  However, he ignores the fundamental problem that most individuals do not have all information available to them at all times (for more on that, read anything by another libertarian, F.A. Hayek).  It's impossible to expect every person to know about every brand or every drug and its relative safety.  The pre-FDA America wasn't a pleasant one for people working in the food and drug industries, or for consumers. <br /> <br />In other words, sometimes government regulation can lead to a public good.  Even conservatives like myself have to acknowledge that.	2005-04-20

Nonetheless, his thesis is quite outdated and has been superceded by more recent scholarship. <br /> <br />Neustadt's fatal flaw is to assume that the individual person in the office is the only thing that matters - if that person has the right set of skills, he can successfully bargain to get his goals accomplished.  However, he doesn't pay enough attention to the role other institutions may play in constraining the president's ability to get what he wants, or how increased presidential power may give the president new resources with which to deal with the other branches. <br /> <br />Neustadt also assumes that all presidents before FDR were \\"pre-modern\\" and \\"mere clerks of the office.\\"  This perspective has been proven false in several respects.  First off, Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson clearly acted like \\"modern\\" presidents in many respects.  Secondly, there are numerous examples of \\"pre-modern\\" presidents acting like the modern ones:  even the much-reviled Rutherford B. Hayes acted like the modern presidents when appointing executive branch officials.  Others such as Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Lincoln, etc., are left out altogether. <br /> <br />If you want to read cutting-edge work that deals with these shortcomings, take a look at Stephen Skowronek's book on the presidency instead.	2005-04-20

Silverstone is a scholar in International Relations, exploring why it is that states go to war with each other.  He theorizes that one reason democracies do not go to war with each other involves their internal domestic politics.  Specifically he examines the U.S. pre-Civil War to prove his thesis. <br /> <br />He considers regional divisions within the U.S. to be primary in explaining why the U.S. often backed down from using force at times when it seemed like a reasonable course of action, such as in 1807 against the British, or in the 1850's against Mexico.  Sectional divisions between north, south, and the northwest prevented many wars that benefited some sections more than others.  The northwest, for example, strongly supported war against Great Britain in 1807, while east coast politicians worried that it would hurt their state's economies too much. <br /> <br />If I could make any criticism of this book, it would be that Silverstone does not pay adequate attention to the institutional transformations within the U.S. occurring during the era he speaks of, such as the gradual strengthening of the presidency.  But overall this book is well-written, with a good sense of history and well-developed theories.	2005-04-20

Tichenor shows us the complex set of connections between political institutions, interest groups, and political actors that combined to produce policy outcomes.<br /><br />One of his most interesting findings regards the unusual fact that while most Americans favor tighter restrictions on immigration, politicians nowadays rarely enact such laws.  Instead they usually increase immigration levels despite broad public opposition.  Tichenor argues that this is because a \\"policy regime\\" has been structured over time, encompassing the immigration committees in both houses of Congress, and including the preferences of strong pro-immigration interest groups, that pushes for liberalization of immigration laws.<br /><br />Only rarely in American history do restrictionists succeed in limiting immigration, most notably from the 1920's until the landmark 1964 law that set off the wave of immigrants from Latin America and Asia we still experience today.  Tichenor's work is easily accessible, well-written, and thought provoking.	2005-04-20

Fenno traveled with congressmen from around the country and examined how they interact with their constituents while \\"at home\\" and out of the Beltway.  His findings are a must-read for anyone interested in politics, Congress, and the legislative process.<br /><br />Fenno finds that congressmen are motivated by three factors: first, a desire to be re-elected; second, a desire to gain power within Congress; and third, to try and enact what they believe to be good public policy.  Congressmen link these desires with their \\"home style,\\" that is to say, how they act when dealing with their constituents, and how that translates into their legislative effectiveness.<br /><br />Fenno also portrays the differing ways that congressmen approach their districts.  Some are more personable, while others are more aloof and indirect in their dealings.  Those who fear losing re-election the least are the least likely to regularly visit their districts (no surprise, but still a useful empirical finding).<br /><br />This book is a must-read!	2005-04-20

This book highlights Barry at his best, hilarious as usual. <br /> <br />The more you know about politics, the funnier this stuff gets.  Barry is a highly intelligent commentator on politics and on the sometimes insane world of campaigning and lawmaking.  His new-and-improved version of the Constitution is roll-on-the-floor laughing material. <br /> <br />Barry also discusses the 2000 presidential candidates, making light of their shortcomings, but also getting serious: he met both of them, and says that Gore was much more personable than he seemed on TV, and Bush much more intelligent.  He's on to an important point here: the way candidates appear on TV, or the ways they are sterotyped by the media, doesn't necessarily have anything to do with who they are in real life. <br /> <br />A must-have for anyone who likes politics, and actually has a sense of humor.	2004-10-09

Tulis has written a brilliant account of the changing styles of presidential rhetoric.  His essential argument is that the Framers intended the President to use rhetoric only to speak directly to Congress, rarely if ever to the masses, and always to put his ideas in a constitutional framework.  But post-Woodrow Wilson, presidents  speak directly to the public, even when ostensibly speaking to Congress, and have tried to overcome the constitutional barriers on their power. <br /> <br />This book is well-written and is compact enough to be read quickly, but these features take nothing away from the superlative scholarship (in fact, many dense books could use some judicious editing down to this size). A must-have for all scholars of the presidency, and for the casual reader who wants to learn more about presidential rhetoric.	2004-10-06

He has given up on trying to explain what happens in reality, and instead focuses on the alleged psychological issues of Bush as they relate to his father (presumably all emanating from some sort of ultimate Oedipal complex). <br /> <br />His research relies almost entirely on media reports and Bob Woodward's 2 journalistic accounts of Bush.

Instead we can better understand the presidency if we realize that the president comes in to the game with institutional advantages over Congress and the courts.   <br /> <br />Debunking further Richard Neustadt's bargaining hypothesis (see his book Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents), Howell argues that presidents have the ability in many situations to use direct forms of action, such as executive orders, rather than relying upon persuasion and normal legislative processes. <br /> <br />Howell's argument is a game-theoretic model, which ultimately undermines somewhat the usefulness of his argument.  He makes some interesting points, but also leaves the reader wondering whether what he says is true in practice and in history, not just in theory. <br /> <br />Overall, recommended for serious scholars of the presidency only.	2004-10-06

(OK, maybe I don't hate it that much, really...) <br /> <br />Despite the complete victory of the U.S. and its capitalistic, free allies in the Cold War, these far-left academics refuse to acknowledge that they were wrong.  They still cling to the radical notion that Americans who joined the Communist Party did it just because they believed in \\"social justice\\" or \\"progressive politics\\"  -- instead of the truth, which is, as Haynes & Klehr have shown in their research, that many American Communists were spies for the Soviet Union and wanted the U.S. to be defeated in the Cold War. <br /> <br />Reading someone like Ellen Schrecker (one of Haynes and Klehr's primary villians) makes you realize just how out of touch these people are with reality.  She lives in a fantasy world where, somehow, believing that the good guys won the Cold War is a form of \\"triumphalism,\\" to quote from the title of her latest offering.   <br /> <br />Haynes and Klehr have, admittedly, written a polemic, though a well-researched one.

Through analyzing the passage of major pieces of legislation over the post-World War II era, Mayhew shows how significant things happen even when Congress and the president belong to different parties (or when Congress is itself divided).   <br /> <br />Of course, this can't take into account the quality of that legislation or its ideological content.  Presumably those are affected by who is in power, where, and when.  But to argue that \\"nothing happens\\" and that there is \\"gridlock\\" during periods of divided government is simply incorrect. <br /> <br />A simple example, occuring after the book was written: Clinton and the 1996 Republican Congress.  After a bruising fight over the budget and 2 government shutdowns, the Congress passed a flurry of important legislation at the end of the 1996 session -- bills increasing the minimum wage, providing health insurance portability, reforming welfare, and others.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended to anyone interested in the subject.

However, the book falls short in several respects. <br /> <br />First, KKV have a tendency to repeat themselves.  They say the same thing over and over in different ways.  In other words, they replicate what they just said.  Duplication is a big problem as well. (Get the hint yet?)  More editing would have helped. <br /> <br />Second, not everything they say can be accepted at face value.  They take seemingly innocent ideas and state definitive conclusions, without letting the reader know that what they're saying overturns years of epistemological research into the nature of scientific research.  People who disagree with their perspective are brushed to the side. <br /> <br />Third, their attempt to unify qualitative and quantitative methods suffers from a bias to the quantitative side of things.  They first explain ideas in quantitative or statistical terms, use a formal analysis, and then state something like, \\"the same method can be used in qualitative analysis\\" without always saying how, precisely, that should be accomplished.  Sometimes, I grant, they provide qualitative examples, but those serve primarily as foils against which they base their hypothesis.  Qualitative researchers quoted by them tend to get torn to shreds by the end. <br /> <br />This book is usually required reading in research design/ research methods courses because it's been the source of most disagreements in political science methodology over the 10 years since its publication.  But if you don't have to read it for a class, don't bother.	2004-10-06

However, this laudable effort is damaged by his insistence upon maintaining the traditional academic liberal lenses of &quot;race, class, gender&quot; in every historical era, as if there were no other ways to understand what happened.

It's not particularly engaging for the reader, and the occasional cutesy attempt to insert cartoons or other stylistic improvements falls flat.  The history is very interesting to someone who cares, but doesn't show the average student why history is important, why it matters that they know it in order to properly understand American politics today.<br />For a slightly better take on an American government textbook with a historical focus, take a look at Landy and Milkis' new textbook.	2004-06-08

His chapter on Madison as the father of the Constitution is wonderful, and his phrase &quot;The Madisonian Moment&quot; is a clever turn on JGA Pockock's famous book.  <br />However, there are a few flaws.  First off, as others have noted, Rakove is not an especially good writer.  He sometimes takes a page to say what could have been said in just a few simpler words.  Second, his conclusions about &quot;original meanings&quot; are not entirely persuasive.  He has a point insofar as he argues that finding the original meaning of the Constitution is a difficult quest, because the Constitution was a document produced by compromises.  However, it does not follow from this that any meaning can be imputed to the Constitution.  There are some interpretations which are simply inconsistent with any reasonable reading of the time and the Philadelphia convention.<br />Nonetheless, a worthwhile book, deserving of its Pulitzer, and a must-read for scholars of the Constitution.	2004-06-08

The portions we read were not interesting, poorly organized and not useful to understanding the presidency.  The psychology employed is pseudo, at best, and relies upon press accounts to comb the minds of presidential candidates from a distance.	2004-06-08

His writing style is very dense, and often unclear - but the hard work necessary to understand him is well worth the effort.    I first read this as an undergraduate, then twice again in graduate school.  Each reading brought out new insights I missed the previous time.    No student of the presidency can afford not to read this.  Quibble with him on some details, perhaps, but overall no one can doubt its lasting importance.  An instant classic.	2004-06-08

Mayhew is one of the few political scientists who knows how to write well, which helps make his work accessible to anyone interested in Congress, not just political scientists.  This book is an interesting and unusual effort to understand congressmen through their &quot;actions in the public sphere.&quot;<br />Mayhew takes a historical angle in this book, going back to Madison in the First Congress.  He is concise, fun to read (as always) and informative.  Highly recommended.	2004-06-08

Redman's story-telling skills are wonderful, he writes well, and clearly explains everything going on in the sometimes arcane world of legislative procedure.  He makes the dullest-seeming motions and committee hearings come alive.<br />Scholars of the Congress should read this, if for no other reason than to get a basic handle on how the Congress actually works, rather than how they think it works in fancy regression analyses.  But more than that, it's the starting point for a whole genre of work such as Showdown at Gucci Culch, Conflict and Compromise, and The Bill (all of which are must-reads as well).  Even a casual observer of politics can get excited and interested.	2004-06-08

It's well-written and well-organized.  His insights into why, when and how presidents &quot;go public&quot; and take their case over the heads of congressmen to the people are informative and worthwhile.  Not all of his observations fit the case studies he uses, and he sometimes exaggerates his case a bit, but overall he makes good points.<br />Highly recommended for scholars of the presidency, or American politics in general.  Also a good book for a knowledgeable layman interested in politics.	2004-06-08

However, it is very dense, is chock-full of advanced statistics above the head of most political science graduate students, and therefore at the end of the day is somewhat unsatisfying.<br />If you need a primer on public opinion research, this isn't it.  But if you want to read cutting-edge work, and you have a good grasp of statistics, dive in.	2004-06-08

There is simply no way to understand the intellectual origins of the Revolution without it.  Also a great read, very well written.	2004-06-08
