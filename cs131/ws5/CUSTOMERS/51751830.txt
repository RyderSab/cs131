Redneck Nation followsw in the Graham tradition of bludgeoning into submission any attempt for the Old South to rise again.  So, obviously Graham sees the needs to point out that the rest of the country, paticularly the self-important intellectual elites, have adopted the Old South's ideals and called them enlightened. Read this book, and you'll be surprised at hoe accurately Graham skewers both the North and South equally.  This book is also laugh out lous funny. Buy it, read, and definitely give one to your Yankee friends.  They'll love it, too.	2004-01-25

The game is that I catch a snippet-a planet name or such-on TV or a movie, and quickly look to see if it's in here.  I have yet to be disappointed.  It's all here. While it would seem short for its steep price, this atlas is worth every penny for the pedantic Trekker who needs everything just right. My only gripe is that I wish there had been more details regarding some of the more important destinations. An index would have been nice to help find some of the more obscure places, too.  Regardless, this is great for those who enjoy both the scientific and political aspects of Star Trek.  There's something for everyone. Here's hoping there comes an updated edition in the future that features some of the spots Enterprise has visited.	2004-01-19

Any autbiography, but especially a political one, is going to be self serving.  This is specially true when the author is rather blatantly usng the book to further his/her own career.  I accept that as a given, and can forgive it.<br />What puzzles me is the tone Ms. Clinton decided to go for.  Painting herself as a victim of her husband's infidelity strikes me as out of character from what I know of her personality, and i assume insulting to her supporters, who viw her as a strong woman, not a put upon wife.  Have Hillary and Bill been in the same room together in three years? One wonders. That's the Hillary Clinton I am familiar with.<br />And that Hilary Clinton shows up quite a bit. From her leftist policy views (a Presidential platform?) to some brutal attacks on Guiliani and Lazio, that's the Hillary Clinton I expect to see. Still, this is how I expected the whole book to be, I was disappointed to read of a weepy betrayal that I really think she <BR>couldn't care less about.    <br />If youare willing to overlook this duality, or are a big fan of Hillary Clinton, you'll like this book. I can't overlook it, am not a fan of HRC, and didn't like it. Three stars for the craftmanship of the ghostwriter.	2003-06-15

Few can deny Larry was the unsung Stooge who never got much of the spotlight from Moe, Curly, et al. This book, written by Larry's younger brother, traces the natural born entertainer's life from birth until his tragic death. I wouldn't call this hard hitting, as the author was not a professinal writer but a loving brother, thus many of Larry's financial problems due to gambling are glossed over. But I can forgive that. In an era of trashy, tell all celebrity books, this is a breath of fresh air. It's a quick read and loaded with photographs spanning the entire Stooges' career. This is a must have for any Stooge fan.	2002-09-01

Straczynski is the perfect authority to write on these subjects, having garnered success in all those fields. <br />The book is a how to manual, with plenty of examples to follow. It also traces out the business side of selling what you write. Straczynski writes in a personable style, but pulls no punches. He helps a potentional writer separate his dreams from reality without crushing one's ambition. This book has been used in colleges as a textbook and upon reading it, yu'll see why. It's a handy reference tool that I have thumbed back through scores of times over the last 3 years. I give it the highest praise.

Kevin J. Anderson's short stories (the bulk of the book) are very uneven. Fans og hid Star Wars or Dune work might want to contemplate a bit before buying this, as it is aradical departure from his usual.<br />Ellison purists might not be too happy at the short story sequel to &quot;Soldier&quot; written by Anderson, but I thought it was decent. My favorite was an adaption of the episode, &quot;The Man Who Was Never Born&quot; from the original series.<br />That, by the way, is the maindrawback. These stories (except for the &quot;Soldier&quot; sequel) are adaptions of existing episodes from the original series. Fans on the new one might want to steer clear.

From a hapless George Bush reeling from the loss of strategist Lee Atwater (RIP) to smooth Bill Clinton's hustling his way into the voter's hearts and minds, Thompson was a fly on the wall for it all.<br />Thompson went out of his way to make himself a part of the whole story, whether anyone wanted him to or not. It's clear by many of the memos and faxes reproduced here, many didn't. But that's part of the fun. Thompson can make politicians wiggle on the hook like no one else can.<br />Better Than Sex is a fantastic time capsule of the 1992 presidential campaign--even predicting that women just might be Clinton's downfall.

The story about a poor Southern family meanders a bit from time to time, which Grisham seems to do evertime he is going into unfamiliar territory. Here that is quaint and entertaining.<br />There isn't a terrific plot here, just a series of events regarding weather disasters, migrant workers, and an assignation. It is all told from the view point of a little boy who strikes me as being a bit too articulate and thoghtful to be 7 years old, but I chalk that up to dramatic necessity. He is the narrator, after all.<br />It's a fun story and worth reading. I'd wait for the paperback if I had to do it all over again, though.	2001-05-13

Plenty of evidence is presented to prove the claims of dishonesty by Roddenberry against not only Ellison, but other creators. &quot;City&quot; is not the first tome to assert Roddenberry's credit stealing or lack of writing ability (although it has never been put so succinctly as when Ellison says Roddenberry, \\"couldn't write worth sour owl poop.\\")<br /> In three separate interviews printed here, Roddenberry claims that Ellison's script was unfilmable for two reasons. One, he had several crewmen acting out of character and two he was over budget. Taking these one at a time, Roddenberry was actually quoted as saying, \\"He [Ellison] had my Scotty dealing drugs!\\" Scotty does not appear on the script anywhere. Several times Roddenberry had apologized for his mistake, but he never seemed to stop making it.<br /> Although Scotty was not dealing drugs, another character created just for this episode, Lt. Beckwith, is dealing in Jewels of Sound, a sonic narcotic. Roddenberry objected to having any of his perfect crew showing such poor character. Perhaps this was Roddenberry's complaint, and not defamation of Scotty, but Starfleet officers in general, whom Roddenberry never wanted to show with conflicts or flaws.<br />  As for the second issue, budget reports reprinted here show Ellison did go over budget $66,000, which is a negotiable amount. Ellison proved he was willing to rewrite to accommodate expenses; he did so three times without pay, something that is against the rules for producers to ask writer's to do, according to the Writer's Guild of America. Roddenberry's claim of being $300,000 over budget is ludicrous and, I would hope, just a result of bad memory and not a willful lie. <br /> No one else is safe from Ellison's legendary wrath, either. He recounts an incident with William Shatner, who had requested to be the absolute first to read Ellison's completed script for &quot;City&quot;. Ellison invited Shatner into his home (after Shatner wipes out his motorcycle showboating in his driveway.) to examine the script. And examine it he does-for several hours. Thus we had the first request for a rewrite, because Shatner had counted the lines he had, and realized that Leonard Nimoy had a handful more. Such were the egos involved here.<br />What exasperates the point to almost unbearable levels is that the original script, unfilmed and owned exclusively by Ellison, won a Writer's Guild of America award, while the filmed version (\\"a thalidomide baby version of my script\\", according to Ellison) won a Hugo in 1967 for Best Dramatic Presentation, the only teleplay ever to do so. Ellison accepted the Hugo award in \\"memory of the script they butchered, and in respect to those parts of it that had the vitality to shine through the evisceration.\\"<br />One is compelled to ask, then: Is the script really that great? In a word, yes. As a piece of writing, the original &quot;City on the Edge of Forever&quot; is a touching story. I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of a legless World War I veteran named Trooper who becomes a tragic hero, so important and yet, unimportant. He is a very poignant character I would have liked to have seen added to Trek lore.<br />     Ellison's original script has an officer, Beckwith, dealing in drugs and then escaping to a nearby planet. Beaming down after him, Kirk and crew discover the Guardians of Forever, who watch over a beautiful ancient city. As in the filmed version, a portal shows the crew events from Earth history, but Beck with is the one to jump through to escape, not McCoy. He is also the one who saves Edith Keeler and changes history.<br />   The love story between Kirk and Keeler is played up, and becomes all the more tragic as Kirk honestly contemplates sacrificing for love the future, as it should be. In the end, Spock must grab and hold Beckwith as Keeler is killed, there by setting the time stream right again. Beckwith jumps back through the portal and lands in the heart of a sun and is forced to repeat that cycle forever.<br />    This book is worth a read through, particularly just to have a copy of the original script. A good seventy pages is nothing but an angry rant by Ellison that true fans of his will enjoy, but others will think is just fussy and unnecessary. Because of this episode's status in the hearts and minds of fans everywhere, the battle to claim credit for it may never cease. Ellison, however, makes a fine case here.	2001-05-10

I like Babylon 5 and most of its tie ins, and this one wasn't much different. I would have liked a little more details on the Telepath War only hinted at here, much I can forgive that, since it is a tale for another time. <br />There is one thing that bugged me throughout the book, though-if Bester is a notorious war criminal known the world over, how can it be so hard to recognize him when he just has a beard as a disguise. His crippled hand should give him away quickly. Isn't that what everyone would be looking for?<br />I think Keyes attempted to make Bester a bit sympathetic here by having him fall in love while also showing his cold-blooded side, but I was not impressed. The Garibaldi-Bester encounter, though, was very interesting. <br />This is the weakest of the Psi Corp Trilogy, only for completists and Garibaldi fans.	2001-04-26

Granted, the arguments  he made are still applied to the TV, movies, and music of today, but never,  I would think, with such enthusiasm as Wertham displayed. <br /> Most of the  examples seem absurd today, even tame, but Seduction of the Innocent is a  must read for anyone who wants to be well versed in the censorship tactics  of those who want to control everything you see and hear. To make you just  like them. <br /> In an interesting twist, Wertham came to admire later  publications of comics as fantastically created works of art. They were, of  course, done by the same kids he was certained would be ruined forever by  readig comics.	2000-05-27

The story was supposed to be a big event--Scotty, Spock, and mcCoy together with the NG crew. The story ranks as entrertaining, but implausible. McCoy  has reached the unusual age of 145, and no one can stop talking about that.   <br /> Scotty steals a 100 year old working ship from a museum (that happens  to have a cloaking device, no less) and enters Romulan space. Picard won't  mount a rescue operation for Spock, but will for Scotty. It's a mess if you  think about it too hard. I give it three stars only because of the  intermittant discussions between Spock and his Romulan students regarding  pacifism v. totalitarianism. Very inciteful and interesting in a novel that  is otherwise brain candy.	2000-05-27

Halley has done a superb study of maps and archeological findings to complement the deep  analysis of theology.<br />This is essential reading for any Christian  apologist and is a perfect introduction to further studies into  apologetics.	1999-12-22

I've run across many skeptics who say this book shoots an arrow throught the heart of Christianity. I was very interested to find out how this man could supposedly singlehandedly destroy Christianity. I was extremely  disappointed. from incorrect assumptions on Christian teachings to inferior  logic, I wondered how anyone could possibly think this is a well thought  out group of essays. It is clear Mr. Russell only wishes for the  destruction of families and marriage, as well as the perversions of  children. Two-thirds of the essays touch on why there isn't more freedom on  sex for all. A severe waste of time and money.	1999-06-20

Asimov's characters are squabbling children and the dialogue wouldn't pass muster in a Flash Gordon serial.  I'll attribute this to the time in which these stories were written just to  be fair. Most writers also try to make their characters appealing and  usually base them on aquaintances. Judging by these characters, one wonders  what kind of people Asimov must have been friends with.	1999-03-07
