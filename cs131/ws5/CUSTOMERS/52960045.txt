A good deal at twice the price.<br /><br />To be honest, I don't find it enjoyable to read SF much these days. This book has made me visit that part of the bookstore again.	2004-12-18

David Braverman, a senior director at Standard &amp; Poor's, looks at how financial aid can be part of your savings plan, how to use 529 and Coverdell plans effectively, and the new tax benefits available. For people who are serious about preparing for one of the major expenditures of their entire lives, this is one of the books you need to read early on.

I'm not sure what that other review was talking about, but it appears to be drug-induced. Certainly the person has never actually read the book.<br />Likely this is just another attack on co-author John Bear. He regularly gets attacked for his other books (on distance learning).<br />This book is well worth the price of admission, particularly if you're looking for something different and unique.	2003-11-02

Paul Clayton brings us a compelling story of the fictional Carl Melcher and his journey into, through, and beyond Vietnam. Even after all this time, there are few works of fiction that adequately capture the Vietnam experience. The reason Clayton does this so well could be that he was part of that experience. Drafted in 1968, Clayton served his country and went to Vietnam. Interestingly, this is also what made the movie &quot;Platoon&quot; so powerful; it was written by someone who had actually been there.<br />I highly recommend this book for all, but particularly for high school students who would like to understand what it was like to be an American during those turbulent years. U.S. history teachers should adopt this book for use in the classroom.<br />Clayton's distinctive voice of experience makes all the difference. You had to be there.<br />Thomas Nixon<br />Author, Bears' Guide to Earning High School Diplomas Nontraditionally<br />[...]	2003-10-14

Diane Flynn Keith has offered what no other book has offered: freedom from the \\"Are we there yet?\\" moans from the backseat. \\"Carschooling: Over 350 Entertaining Games & Activities to Turn Travel Time into Learning Time\\" takes advantage of the free time that children often have in cars and turns it into learning time. It would be a mistake to view this book as solely for homeschoolers; it is for anyone with children ages 4 to 17 (and beyond). There is no other book like it on the market.

Baker's Guide is *the* book for people interested in online learning and religious education. It provides everything that you need to know to succeed in religious distance education.<br />Having written in this field (&quot;Bears' Guide to the Best Education Degrees by Distance Learning&quot; and &quot;Bears' Guide to Earning High School Diplomas Nontraditionally&quot;), I can tell you that Dr. Baker has done his homework. Yes, he only lists accredited programs. I have no problem with that. Most people are going to find little use with unaccredited degrees.<br />I have recommended this book to others (some of whom used the information and are now earning degrees). In addition to solid information, Baker writes well, a not inconsequential piece of information.	2003-07-15

This is a great introduction to Mikhail Gorbachev for younger (and not-so-younger) readers. Gorbachev's reform movement was unlike anything anyone had ever seen in the then-Soviet Union. He helped vastly improve U.S.-Soviet relations and gave greater freedom and ultimately independence to the Soviet republics.<br />This book, edited by Tom Head, is a compilation of articles published elsewhere that brings together the personal and professional history of one of the great men of the twentieth century.<br />Clearly, a superior choice for individuals and the library & schools market.

This is particularly true if you are lucky enough to have Hmong students. My class, which is usually about half Hmong, always gets excited that the book has a Hmong name in it and one of the main characters is Hmong. Why? Because it is extremely unusual. By the time they reach me, they've read many books with quite traditional names, but often have never read a book that has a name similar to their name.<br />Besides, and equally important, it's a great book to start the year off with. The story is about being new in the school and how Pa Lia feels about her situation.<br />Great book!	2002-07-12

One is Bears' Guide to the Best MBAs by Distance Learning.  I bought both books and it's not even close.  This is particularly true if cost is important.  Bears' book provides many more international MBAs (UK, Australia, Canada) which are far cheaper than almost all of the U.S. programs, but are still academically quite strong (and better than many of the U.S. programs).<br />It is now well-known that Peterson's sells ad space in their books disguised as research.

Books by John &amp; Mariah Bear have literally changed people's lives.  This is no less true for this book.  Although not quite the behemoth that the larger &quot;Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning (14th ed.), this book instead provides a tight focus on specific programs for those who either need a little more guidance or for whom smaller/less expensive works better.  It still provides the same solid advice that readers have come to trust from the Bears.<br />College Degrees by Mail and Internet provides all of the information necessary to earn a degree (BA, MA, PhD) through distance learning.  Now in its eighth edition, this book has stood the test of time.<br />If you're looking to change your life (more money, better work, etc), you need to check this book out.	2001-09-29

Thinking about getting a degree in a computer-related field to enhance your current position or to seek a new one?  Have one of those jobs where you have to work 60 hours a week just to keep up?  If this sounds like you, I'd like to offer you two recommendations:<br />1.  Find out everything that you can about distance learning.  Learn from where you are, be that a hotel room on the road or your kitchen table at home.  There are many different formats available, including on-line, correspondence, video, audio, et cetera.<br />2.  After you have done the above, rush out and buy &quot;Bears' Guide to the Best Computer Degrees by Distance Learning&quot;.  It provides all of the information that you will need to discover the best programs suitable to your unique situation.  You will find many programs from which to choose your IT, CS, or CIS degree.<br />This book is well worth the... price because it will quickly pay for itself with your getting a new or better job.<br />Happy reading (and job hunting!)	2001-03-19

Walter Dean Myers is certainly better-known for his chapter books for children than for poetry.  That being said, &quot;Harlem&quot; offers an insight into the place as well as the man.

As an adult, I purchased a first edition of &quot;Johnny Tremaine&quot; because I wanted a small piece of history (and it was a steal!).<br />&quot;Johnny Tremaine&quot; is a story set against the beginning of the American Revolution.  Although ostensibly a coming of age story for Johnny, it is also provides a gripping portrayal of the people and places that made up this great nation.  Johnny comes to know well many of the fathers of our country.  It is through his eyes that we see the bravery of these early patriots.<br />It captivated me as a boy.  I've recently re-read it and it is still just as good.	2001-02-26

Of course they're accurate.  However, ASL like all languages is dialectal.  Just as we use a different word in one part of the country for something in another part of the country, so, too, with signing.  Some signs in California are different than New York.

As the father of two adopted Ethiopian daughters, it is difficult to find books that speak to their culture and ethnic heritage.  John Steptoe has done a wonderful job of showcasing what is essentially the &quot;Cinderella&quot; story within the African context.  Not every  hero/heroine must be of European descent and Steptoe proves this.  The  themes throughout the book transcend culture, but relate to that which is  important for all cultures.  Besides, and most importantly of all. this  book is a good read.  Highly recommended!!!	1999-05-14
