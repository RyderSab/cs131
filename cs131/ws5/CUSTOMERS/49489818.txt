Most fantasies are variations on Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings or the King Arthur stories. But here comes the Monkey King, a fantasy based off of Chinese Legend. It has memorable characters and truly magnificent settings like a palace full of Gods. I can't wait till the miniseries comes to TV. Keep up the good work Hallmark.	2001-02-05

The main characters are very well developed and likable. The book is very descriptive and exciting, full of vivid scenes of ancient cities, powerful monsters, and a Palace full of Gods. The only sour point is that the main villains are not really given enough time in the book to develop and stick in your memory. But in this story that hardly matters. I suggest anyone looking for a different kind of fantasy give this book a shot.	2001-02-02

While it is somewhat slow to start, once the action starts the book becomes breathtaking. Well written characters, especially the vulgar dwarf, and action scenes alone make this worth buying, but with the hilarious comedy and a real sense of magic and vivid scenes of the Battle for Izmer it becomes a classic novelization. I only wish Neal Barrett, Jr. had written the Titan A.E. novelization instead of Steve and Dal Perry.	2001-01-21

This book is alright, yeah. But the way he describes Darth Vader's thoughts and actions does not live up to the image of Vader. He makes Vader seem weak! Also he doesn't flesh out action scenes and characters like Kevin J. Anderson did with his Star Wars novels. Steve Perry also wrote a poorly written novelization of Titan A.E. I haven't seen that movie, but I know bad writing style when I see one.	2000-11-02

The use of profainity is unnecessary. And the she slept with him/he  slept with her subplots steal every potential storyline in the book, making  a terrible novel. The only good thing about the book is the excellent  cover. That is the only reason this got 2 stars instead of one. Read the  Odyssey books by Arthur C. Clarke instead.	2000-08-31

I liked how they handled the confrontation scenes in the movie more than those in the book, because nothing beats the  movie's sewers. For much better Stephen King, read Bag of Bones, The  Shining, Christine, and Salem's Lot. Skip out on Cujo, The Running Man, and  It.	2000-07-31

This novel perfectly recaptures the feel of the show with a masterfully written plot, more details to the beloved characters of the series. Even Baltar is back. The action is  brilliantly vivid and exciting. And the ending is just right. I definitely  want to read the sequels.	2000-07-18
US	49489818	R3DK0PGT2FFQ3G	0380708213	223407615	The Forever War	Books	5	2	2	N	N	The best single military Science Fiction novel ever.	Most military science fiction novels are written as a series of books. Some, like Starship Troopers and The Forever War, are stand alones. The Forever War is a short book, but Haldeman is a brilliant storyteller. He  gives it a depth most books need 400 to 900 to attain. Also, you actually  care about the characters. Let me tell you people, there is not one part of  this classic book that lets it's reader down. It completely blew me away.  For more good military scifi, read David Feintuch's Hope novels, starting  with Midshipman's Hope.	2000-07-12

It was hard to keep interested in the book, even during the Pinto experience. What really got me was the closet part at  the beginning. The story just didn't need any supernatural stuff in it. It  would have been better without the closet monster bit.Worth reading but not  buying.	2000-06-27

What happened was that the Psychlos got defeated  in the first half. Then humanity had to set up a new form of government,  and then there is yet another threat. The problem is, that the  Psychlo/human battles at the first half of the novel are more interesting  than the rest of the book.However, of all the books that I have read, this  is the one book that I would consider complete, with no possiblility of a  sequel. Everything gets wrapped up. Read it at your library first before  buying it. The author's writing is not the best. Also, I wish Terl was used  more in the novel.	2000-06-19

I just finished 11th grade. Now, I don't do everything that most of these kids do in the book(drugs, sex, alcohol), but I found myself considering these characters very real. The idea of a  haunted car is older than the book is, but, in several scenes, you really  feel the tension. Nothing beats the part in Darnell's garage. Those of you  who have read it know what I mean.	2000-06-01

The miniseries was good, and I was on the lookout for the book. Well, at my vocational school, I noticed it and read  it the first chance I got. The miniseries was so faithful to the book, that  not one part scared me. But, it was still great reading. Definetly not for  kids under 13. I prefered the head vampire concept in the miniseries over  that in the book.	2000-06-01

This the second Stephen King novel that I have read, and it is still my favorite King novel. Brilliantly written and thought out, it is extremely absorbing. This book delivers one heck of a haunted house story. King may  hate the movie, but even though I read the book before I saw all the  movie(I saw clips of it while channel surfing), Jack Torrence looked and  sounded like Jack Nicholsen in my minds eye. Read it!	2000-06-01

But, how many of us didn't cheer for Carrie when she killed Billy and Chris? The destruction of the town is so vivid, that you can see it.

He loses his wife and sun to an alien attack, he is betrayed by an admiral, some of his passengers are bigots and violent street children, and Nick is forced to  break an oath. David Feintuch is my favorite author, and he shows an  incredible writing talent by adding depth to Nick and his world, making the  aliens actually scary, and delivering an exciting and moving story.

However, his first book is one of my favorites. This book and it's sequels is surprisingly detailed and well thought out. And the action  is really fast paced and absorbing. But what really makes this series  memorable and worth buying is that it is extremely compelling. You feel the  tension, the fear, the joy, the rage, and the sadness that Nicholas Seafort  feels throughout the series. Buy it and read it!	2000-05-22
