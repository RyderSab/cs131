It's a place where   everyone knows each other, and they don't have to lock their doors -- that is, until strange disappearances start to happen.   Then the towns' people don't know who to trust. <br />  Kirstin Stafford, a 13-year-old, is the first to vanish without a trace, Allison Myers, a 15-year-old, disappears three weeks   later, and Carleen Connolly, a 14-year-old, vanishes a few weeks after her. Now it's 10 years later and Rory Connolly   (the sister of Carleen Connolly who disappeared 10 years ago) has returned to Lake Charolotte from Berkley California   where she attended college. <br />  On the 10th anniversary of the first girl's disappearance, Emily Anghardt vanishes.  Why is it starting all over again? Rory   wants to find out so she can have some answers about her sister's disappearance. What Rory doesn't know is she is in   danger as well as other young girls. <br />  The characters are well defined and realistic in the sense that they are not perfect so that the reader can understand why   they made the mistakes they did.  I thought that I had it all figured out early in the book, but was I dead wrong. ALL THE   WAY HOME is a well-told story with a lot of spooky revelations, fantastic amazement, and plenty of thrills and chills to   keep you hanging on to every word right up to the breath-taking and astonishing conclusion.	2001-06-09

The answer soon becomes clear as the corpses keep piling up, and Natalie feels as if she is being watched.<br />  Police Chief Nick Meredith swears he will keep Natalie safe, and pretty soon it becomes clear that the urgency he feels is   because he is falling for Natalie. <br />  DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES is one of those books that keeps your heart racing and your body tensed up until the very   spine tingling, awesome ending.  There are many characters in the book that are well defined and believable. Believe me,   you'll never guess who the slasher is until the very last minute, and that's what makes DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES such   a nail biting mystery. This was my first Carlene Thompson mystery, and it definitely won't be my last.	2001-06-09

With the help of Denver,   whom she is falling in love with, she takes up the job of getting to the bottom of these tragedies. <br />   LOOK AWAY FROM EVIL is a well-written book about the ultimate in dysfunctional families at their worst. I suspected   every character because they all had skeletons in their closets, but I never figured out the real story.

It moves along at a fast pace and delivers lots of suspense.   M.R. Sellers writes with such graphic descriptions that you feel you are there witnessing it with your own eyes.

Fred considers him self a virtuous and exemplary person, but will he feel the same  when he finds himself twice tempted?  <br /> William Manchee has successfully penned another outstanding novel, keeping me spell bound throughout. I hesitate to say too  much, because it's one of those books which proves true that \\"all is not as it seems,\\" and I don't want to give too much away.  I will say this, the plot was free flowing with plenty of twists and turns, and I was clueless all the way up to end and what an  ending it was!  <br /> TWICE TEMPTED will have readers questioning their own morals and values, and wondering how they would react if faced  with the same situation.	2001-05-09

Even when they   were separated because of Matt's affair, they would sometimes meet there, but this Sunday night was life altering.

Mattie must not only deal with her own feelings of grief; she must help her grown children get through this crisis even   though she is questioning her own survival and sanity. <br />  Potthoff's character of Mattie is written with such detail you can feel her raw emotions as her world is being turned upside   down. I used more than one Kleenex to get through this one.  The supporting characters are all very intriguing with   underlying issues of their own. I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout this book until the surprising ending.  I look   forward to seeing more from this author, and hopefully soon.	2001-05-09

Why?  Because it would probably put you off, and that would be a shame because this is  an extraordinary book that will surely alter your life as it did mine. Ms. Ford teaches us to deal with our inner demons or  shadows as they are called in the book Shadow work as Ms. Ford refers to is the on going process of depolarizing, and  balancing to heal the split between the conscious sense of self and the all else we are or could be. We learn that `Dark' doesn't  mean only negative, it refers to something out of the light of our conscious awareness.  <br /> We know our shadow by many names, dark side, alter ego, the dark twin, the repressed self. I always told myself that I was  crazy, I'm not worthy of the nice things that I have, and worst of all I felt unloved. Believe me when I say the hardest thing in  the world to do is to look deep inside yourself honestly and for me it all came out in anger, learning to own the anger and then  dealing with it so I could change that pattern in myself. When we do that our whole way of thinking changes for the better.  <br /> THE DARK SIDE OF THE LIGHT CHASERS is a wonderful self-help book and will show you how to be a whole person if  you really want it.	2001-03-03

At first, Natalie does not take   them seriously because every one knows that Louise writes herself letters to answer. Natalie suggests that Louise write a   response to the writer of the letter and that would put a stop to the letters. The letters continue and become bolder. They   are written in riddles and containing references to murders committed and a thirst for vengeance.     Natalie turns to Rebecca Elias, a psychologist, who also happens to be Daniel's girlfriend. Natalie and Rebecca decide if   they can figure out the riddles, they can figure out who the writer is.

I can see why Oprah choose it for   her book club selection.      DROWNING RUTH starts off in the winter of 1919 and takes place in Wisconsin. Amanda Starkey, a nurse in   Milwaukee, finds herself burned out and returns to her family's farm on Lake Naguwaukee. Her sister Mattie and   3-year-old niece Ruth are living there and taking care of the farm while Mattie's husband Carl is away at war. Amanda soon   realizes that she cannot leave problems behind so things are stormy on the farm. About a year later, Mattie turns up missing   and is soon found dead in the frozen lake. Amanda assumes all responsibility of the farm, and Ruth until Carl returns. When   Carl does return, he is wounded, and it soon becomes clear that Amanda would rather not have him there at all. Amanda   wants to have Ruth all to herself. Ruth's childhood is not a very happy one; Amanda is over protective and rigid.     As the story unfolds, so do the secrets that were never meant to see the light of day. The story goes back and forth from the   past to the present and is told in the voices of Amanda, Carl, and Ruth. I actually thought that I had the ending figured out   before hand, but     I was wrong. I must admit that I was a tiny bit disappointed with the ending, but that does not take away the fact that   DROWNING RUTH is remarkably written and a very splendid read.	2001-02-07

Meg has to repo a jeep belonging to Clay Bennett, the same Clay Bennett that was just found dead. Meg figures   that it will be easy to get the jeep back, but once she has it back the trouble starts. Someone else wants     the jeep, next thing you know Meg is drawn into a murder mystery involving sex and violence. As Meg tries to solve the   mystery she must deal with her own ghosts from her past as well as deal with Russian thugs and Tina Red Dear, a Native   American woman who could very well be her half sister.      I thought that ICED was well written but left me with to many unanswered questions about Megs past. The mystery   involving Clay Bennett was top-notch with plenty of suspense. Meg is a protagonist that really wants to be left alone to live   her life low- key with coffee, cigarettes, beer, and burgers in that order.	2001-02-07

I have had    the good fortune to review both books and they are real winners. <br />   Lizbet got involved with Charlie Bilbo (a ghost) when in CHARLIE'S BONES, his body was unearthed while work men    were digging a swimming pool in Lizbet's back yard. She then helped Charlie solve his murder, which happened in 1969.    Afterwards Charlie went away and Lizbet had not heard from him till now, and he needs help again to solve the murder    of 10 year-old Rachel Wright who disappeared on Halloween night in 1973 from Oak Valley, California. <br />   Lizbet is now involved with Charlie's son, Jonathan, who was just a toddler when Charlie died.  Jonathan is a police    officer just like his father was; Jonathan has no idea that Lizbet has contact with Charlie.  If he did, he would not believe    it any way.  <br />   Lizbet and Charlie are able to communicate through thoughts, but at times Lizbet will forget and she will talk out loud.   It    gets her into trouble; people look at her as if she is losing her mind.  Lizbet is a wonderfully real protagonist, who has    down to earth values.  She cares a lot about people, even though she inherited millions of dollars and lives in a mansion.     Charlie is like a child; he will talk to Lizbet at the most inconvenient times.  She can be in a conversation with some one,    and Charlie will start yelling in her head to \\"do this\\" or \\"ask this question\\" or tell her \\"let's go now,\\" which makes it very    hard to concentrate on the topic at hand. <br />   CHARLIE'S WEB is a fast and sometimes capricious read, filled with classic lines of comedy. I was so enthralled with    this book that I was able to read it on a slow Saturday. It's a really grand book to read.  L.L. Thrasher, you have done it    again; hurry up with the next installment of Lizbet and Charlie.  Readers can expect a surprise ending.	2001-01-01

Evelyn was    used to consuming large numbers of Manhattans through her day and this made her unable to make an unbiased    decision.   While Kim was helping her mother, Kim's cousin A.C. is murdered. His body is found behind the radio station    in a plastic bag inside the dumpster with a certain body part missing. Kim finds out that another murder had taken place    two-weeks before her arrival in Fogerty and was very similar. The other victim was a redneck crummy tavern owner by    the name of Jimmy Jacob's, and his throat was slashed, his body was found in the parking lot of the tavern. <br />   Amy Delozier an old friend of Kim's calls and asks for her help in clearing her brother who has been accused of killing    the two men.

Can Kim help Amy clear her brother or not? <br />   Ms. Erhardt has a real winner on her hands with SHE LOVES ME, SHE LOVES ME NOT.  Most of the characters    are unpretentious back woods type that makes you laugh out loud sometimes. Kim is a real gutsy type of woman, who    drinks beer, smokes cigars and can out swear any sailor.  Some murder details are grisly, and this book is of a mature    nature. SHE LOVES ME, SHE LOVES ME NOT has mystery, amusement, small-town cops and their lack of    know-how and topless dancers thrown into the mix, an excellently written first book with conspiracy that's all rolled up    into a nice tight package with no loose ends remaining. <br />    I can hardlywait for the next Kim Claypoole mystery.	2000-12-07

Wow, I was hooked from the start. <br />  Malcolm Rutland III has just married 26-year-old Candace.  The reception    was being held at the Waldorf Astoria, and the bride and groom had the Presidential Suite for the night.  The couple had   decided to go up to their suite to change into something comfortable for the reception.  When they got to the room,   Malcolm decided to take a shower.  While her bridegroom is showering, Candace hears a noise.  When she turns around,   she sees a man, but it is to late for her to scream.  The knife comes down across her throat deeply, severing her vocal   cords, and her perfect day comes to a lethal end.  A day later Mitchell and Sydney Cunningham, who had attended the   wedding and reception of Malcolm and Candace, were the next victims.  Sydney was the first to be killed in their Park   Ave. apartment, as she was about to leave for a tennis game.  Her neck was cut clear to the spine.  She was found by her   husband, who knows what the murders are all about.  He tries to run, but before he can get away, he is murdered in the   same fashion as his wife.  The author's description of the murders are so chilling that you can all most envision it in your   mind's eye. <br />  The commander of Manhattan South, Jack Jennings Sr., and the Chief of New York City's Homicide Division, Liz Phillips,   take charge of the cases, since they arehigh profile.  Liz feels that, after the last two murders, they must get someone to go   under cover, since the suspected murderer is very affluent and powerful and well connected.  When Liz tells Jack that it   should be his daughter, Carla, Jack hits the ceiling.  He argues that Carla is not ready yet, even though she is a top cadet in   the academy.  She is not experienced enough for such a big case.  Carla overrules her father and decides that she will go   undercover for the Department.  Before she can go under cover she must completely metamorphose herself into someone   different.  Carla becomes Charlotte Desmond, who is classically tailored, well educated and a well-bred young woman   with a taste for the Tiffany style.  Even though her life depends on it, can Carla pull it off? <br />   Ms. Sauter sure did her homework when she wrote this book; the details on chemistry and the opera were factual.  The   heroine, Carla, fits into her role as a rich socialite like hand in a tailored glove.  The writing is very explicit and electrifying   enough, with many twists and turns, to keep you hanging on to every word, right up to the scandalous end.  I was really   sorry when this book ended; it was such an illustrious read.	2000-12-07

I had seen Sylvia Browne on the  Montel show several years ago, and have tried to watch every Montel show that she was on.  I have seen her solve murder  cases for the police and help families find their loved-ones, or their remains, and Sylvia has been right on the money. <br /> In the first part of the book, she speaks of the many dimensions and planes, and that the place we gravitate to depends on our  actions on earth.  Of course, we already knew that. Sylvia also includes a meditation technique for finding your &quot;true&quot; name  which to me sounds a little far-fetched.  Meditation we could all use, but come on.  I think that I already know my &quot;true&quot; name.   Sylvia also tells us about her &quot;spirit guide&quot; Francine and what Francine tells her about the other side and how perfect it is on the  other side.  She also talks about out of body experiences.  At the end of the book she has several pictures of what the afterlife  looks like.  I personally could not buy into the picture theory, but that is my own opinion. <br /> LIFE ON THE OTHER SIDE is a very interesting read.	2000-11-05

Now Angelo and his wife, Regina, have heard from a Dr. Walter Daimler, from Berkley College, that the drug JCD that   was used for Wann's patients is toxic and killing patients rather than helping them.

At first,   Bomber does not want to help them, but soon changes his mind.  Bomber sends in his son Todd as he always does to   investigate.

Hickey is so good at it, he   can exact his crime in 24 Hours.   With hellish precision, he squeezes a family's pressure points, extorts the ransom and   vanishes into thin air, leaving the hostages alive (his promise is the kid always makes it out alive), but the family is too   shattered to call the police.  Hickey has carried out his plan five times now and hasn't been caught.  He has his sights on his   next victim, Abby Jennings, the five-year old daughter of Dr. Will Jennings and his wife, Karen, of Jackson Mississippi; this   time there is a possible problem that Hickey does not know about. <br />  Greg IIes takes a parent's greatest horror, the kidnapping of a child, and turns it into a whopper of a chiller.  As the title   tells us, the book takes place in 24 HOURS.  But in that 24 hours, though you move along at a frenzied pace, you also get   to know each and every character intimately.  The story line is disturbing and yet fascinating at the same time.	2000-11-05

A corvette cuts off a semi on the expressway and causes the semi to hit the center medium and   jack knive, exposing enough concrete all the way up to the cement pillar where it connected to the overpass. Enough   concrete had broken away to expose mummified remains, perfectly preserved.  <br />  Jake Mitchell and his partner Frank Travis get the case, along with their new partner Detective Sergeant Sam Casey who is   not the usual police officer. She has inherited a gift from her mother and grandmother. Sam's mom Abby is a Sioux   medicine woman, and they both have the ability to speak to the dead. Sam knows facts that no one else knows.  <br />  The body that was encased in cement was that of a solider from the Korean War who was reported AWOL and in his   hand was a lighting bolt pin, which when Sam touched, she saw dozens of lighting bolt shapes. She also saw body parts   lying in a field. Sam felt a cold wave go up her body and the hair raise than the vision ended.  Sam remembers that she saw   another lighting bolt pin in a safe of State Representative Preston Hillard when she was under cover at his home. Hillard   claims to know nothing about the pin and never knew the dead man.  Sam finds out that her dad had one in his jewelry   box.  What do the solider and her father have to do with each other?   Sam must uncover the facts even though her own   boss Murphy has closed the case for good. <br />   WHEN THE DEAD SPEAK is a fast-paced, topsy-turvy ride that mixed with humor and a little loving along the way will   keep you enthralled all the way through the book.  I really liked the fact that mixed into the pot is some Native American    Culture, which made the book even more tantalizing. I can hardly wait for the next Sam Casey mystery to come out.

Richard goes to Switzerland and brings   Erica home. Shortly after they return to the States, Erica seduces Richard and even though he knows that it is wrong, he   lets it happen. Before long they are in love. Richard knows that he could lose his license if word of their liaison gets out;   they are able to keep it quiet for quite a while until Erica's Aunt Martha finds out. Aunt Martha really only wants the   money. She could care less about Erica's feelings so she decides to start a lawsuit against Richard and have him removed   as trustee of the estate.  <br />  Before Aunt Martha can reach her son Arnold about the lawsuit, she is murdered in her hotel room and Erica's purse is   found in the room. At about the same time Richard is found unconscious in an alley. The next day when he comes to, he   remembers nothing about what happened to him. While he is watching a news broadcast, he hears that Erica has been   arrested. He knows without a doubt that Erica could not murder anyone; he has to leave the hospital and find the real killer.   Erica convinces Richard that if she is convicted they should make a death pact. Richard really doesn't want to die, so he   knows that he must find the killer before it's too late. This is where the storyline really takes off! <br />  Death Pact is so wonderfully written with plenty of surprises. I was guessing till the very end, and what an unexpected,   shocking end it was! The setting is in Dallas in the 1980's, and from the author's descriptions, I felt as if I was there. <br />  The characters are really well defined and believable, especially Aunt Martha -- The more that I read about her meanness,   the less guilty I felt that she died so she couldn't cause any more trouble. The romance was very fiery and passionate   between Richard and Erica. You could almost feel the warmth radiate through the pages. <br />  Death Pact is a grand read.  My highest score is a 5 and this book definitely deserves a HIGH  rating.	2000-10-11

Tooley Full Moon Publishing  - April 2000 ISBN: 0966602129 - H.C. Mystery / P.I.<br />NOTHING ELSE MATTERS is the second SAM CASEY MYSTERY; the first was WHEN THE DEAD SPEAK.<br />Sam Casey is back again, and this time she is suspended from the force, married to Jake Mitchell, pregnant, and not ready just yet to tell Jake the news as she blames him for her suspension. This book starts off where the last one left off and goes over things of importance from WHEN THE DEAD SPEAK so if the reader has not read it, they will not be confused. There is a murder on the River Queen Casino. Reverend Smith was murdered and found with fifty-thousand dollars on his body.  The owners of the River Queen Casino, Harold McFadden, William Bordon Sr, and William Bordon Jr, hire Sam to investigate the murder, and clear the River Queen of any wrongdoing. This means that she will be running into Jake, for he is assigned the case by the police department.  While on the River Queen, Sam picks up a book of matches on the bar, and she gets chilled all over as she picks up images of the killer, she hears voices crying out and sees a vision of a tattoo of a bird and underneath it is the word &quot;Sparrow.&quot;<br />NOTHING ELSE MATTERS is just as rich in details and grand writing style as WHEN THE DEAD SPEAK.  The author manages to pull you into the story line so well that you want the story of Sam and her friends to keep on going. There is Tim the young computer genesis, Jackie Delaney the ex-hooker friend that has helped Sam in the past and would do anything for her friend Sam. There are so many extraordinary characters, each one well defined in their own way and fitting into the plot and just like WHEN THE DEAD SPEAK, you get more Native American Culture.<br />This book kept me hanging on every word till the very end. I can't wait for the next installment of Sam Casey.  Keep up the great writing S.D. Tooley and bring us a lot more Sam Casey Mysteries.<br /> Pam Stone	2000-10-02

Chase knows Sara well enough to know that if she said she saw it, it really happened, so they look around and in the fireplace under a log they find a single earring.<br /> <br />Chase is invited to a party the next evening and the party is given by the rich and powerful Robert Tyler, the father of Shelia Tyler, Chases former fiancé, who now refuses to take \\"no\\" for an answer and believes that Chase wants no part of her, but Chase decides to go anyway and take Sara as his date. Once there, Sara sees a picture of the blond that she saw murdered just forty-one hours before. When she and Chase start asking around they find out that the blond is Rachel Tyler and she went missing five years earlier when she was thought to have fell overboard.  Robert Tyler hires Dagger Investigations to look into his wife's disappearance. Dagger and Sara decide not to tell Robert Tyler what Sara had witnessed the day before.<br />This is a very well spun mystery that has more twists and turns than a roller coaster. Just when you think that you have it all figured out, boom! there goes another bomb off. There are so many great characters in this book. My favorite two are Einstein, a bright red Macaw who has some very colorful language, and he repeats what ever he hears. Einstein loves to sing at the mailman &quot; Mr. Postman Please Mr. Postman &quot;, and then there is Sara, a very special young lady who is Native American and was home schooled by her grand mother Ada Kills Bull. Sara has the talent to &quot;shape-shift &quot; and, according to Native Mythology, it means to shift between human and animal forms, Sara could change into a hawk or gray wolf, allowing Sara to be undercover, up close, and not be noticed. <br /> <br />Be prepared for when you start reading this book. You will not be able to put it down. I couldn't.	2000-10-02

Kate reminds Charlotte that she is a caterer and not a private investigator. Charlotte says that she cannot trust anyone else to do it for her except Kate since Victor is the father of the young Eric whom her daughter Melissa is engaged to, and she does not want Melissa to marry someone connected to the mob. Charlotte reminds Kate that she did solve a couple of murders this year; Kate tells her there was a difference.  She did not set out to be involved in solving the murders. It was dumped into her lap.  Kate is used to Clairmont blue bloods hiring her to help them celebrate their families wedding not to prevent them from taking place. Lately, though, Kate has been feeling a melancholy grab her. Getting tired of walking into her kitchen and trying to generate enthusiasm for the day's list of parties and the awaiting crowds of hungry mouths, Kate is going through a career burnout.

Kate is summoned to see Victor's Uncle Peepo, who now wants to hire Kate to find out what happened Victor, even though the police think it was an accident.<br />CARVE A WITNESS TO SHREDS is the best of the three Kate Cavanaugh Mysteries.  It is very well written with lots of twists and turns. A lot of the same fetching characters from the first two books are in this book also; even Mr. Boo-Kat who has his own problems in this outing. A loose coyote on the farm is hindering his freedom.  I really liked the fact that the author goes over facts from the previous books so if the reader has not read the other books he or she is not totally lost. The facts maybe considered spoilers by some. So if you are planning to read the series you may want to start from the beginning.	2000-10-02

By now with Grafton more than half way through the  alphabet, many readers have become thoroughly addicted to this appealing  private detective who lives and works in Santa Teresa, California. So  naturally we want to know every single thing about her.   Kinsey's  combination of toughness and vunerabilty, bravery and intellectual  keenness, compassion and aloofness, engages a wide range of reader of all  ages and careers.  Kinsey's ability to defeat the enemy in a terrifying  final confrontation.     The personal struggles that she goes through in  order  to do the clean-up, reassure us that our own fears and phobias are  both normal and manageable.  If Kinsey is scared of getting an injection  from the nurse, yet is capable of running after a murderer and tackling him  to the ground, then maybe we can gather up nerve to go on with our daily  lives.<br />Each chapter of the book explores some aspect of Kinsey's life or  character, beginning with the specifics of her biography, her daily life,  her friends, her favorite places, and her work.  Readers may want to use  the table of contents which is detailed enough to allow a reader who, for  example, wants to know how Kinsey found Henry Pitts and her apartment or  when her apartment was bombed and rebuilt, can learn the answer in chapter  3:  Kinsey's daily life under apartments. In Chapter 4 you will find out  why you will never know her full name.<br />This book is a very informative  book about an intriguing character that most of us love.  We learn  everything about Kinsey and everything in her life that we ever wanted to  know.  What a wonderful book.	2000-09-16

The killing was similar to  several murders that started up in   Houston during the war.  The Houston  killer, dubbed the \\"Maniac\\" in the hometown press, was credited with 17  straight razor   murders in and around the city.  Most of the dead were  prostitutes, while a few were plain old dirt poor, ignorant girls.  David    must make his case while he has a reporter, Francy Cotton, on his trail  wanting a story even though she knows that Judge   Skelton has imposed a  gag order.  Francy also wants David to talk about his dad's death that took  place in 1932.  Francy feels   that it was murder and not an accident.   David must battle several issues at once.  An anonymous messenger threatens  his   fiancee, Leslie Holcomb, while old and new family secrets endanger  his freedom and his life. <br />  The story line was very interesting and well  plotted.

She is still the forensic anthropologist in both  Montreal   and North Carolina. Pierre LaManche is Tempe's boss, and he is  in the hospital so Tempe must take over the case. A child   is involved so  it really gets to the core of her being, and she wants to solve the case  and fast, but she knows it will not be   easy. Two Outlawed Motorcycle Gang  members are dead from a vicious and ongoing altercation between the  Heathens   and the Vipers. The two gang members were blown up by a bomb  into a million small parts, and what makes it even harder   for Tempe. The  bikers were identical twins with matching DNA. Tempe takes identifying the  bikers as relatively routine   part of her job, like putting a forensic  puzzle together. The Heathens strike back at the Vipers, and unfortunately  a   nine-year-old girl named Emily Anne Toussant, who was on her way to  school, gets caught in the crossfire. For Tempe that   becomes her  cataplasm she joins the gang task force. They discover a teenaged girl's  body buried at a biker clubhouse.   The girl is Savannah Osprey who was  last seen thumbing a ride with a transient biker. Also drawn into the case  is Tempe's   nephew Kit, who doesn't realize that these gangs are the kiss  of death for outsiders. Lyle Crease is a smart-aleck   newscaster who wants  to use Kit to get to Tempe. Be prepared for the body count to rise in this  outing. <br />  I was as grabbed with Deadly Decisions as I was with Deja Dead  and Death du Jour. This book is filled with rich details of   the cutting  edge forensic techniques that Kathy Reichs uses in her real life work,  that's why the forensic details are so   gruesome. The author takes the  reader into the dark and shocking world of the international motorcycle  gangs, and what a   wild ride it is, it will scare the pants off of you at  times.  <br />  This book was fast-paced and bone chilling and is going to  make Kathy Reichs star shine even brighter than before.	2000-08-07

So, at the age of eight, her  grandmother got in touch with her father and told him to take Debbie, or  she   would have him brought up on abandonment charges. Debbie's father  took her but he treated her badly the whole time that   he had her. <br />   After a choir teacher of Debbie's told her how much she looks like a famous  Las Vegas singer named Colette, Debbie   learns everything she can about  Colette and becomes an impersonator for the stage.

Susan freaks because she knows that this is not true. She then  calls her   husband, Jeff at the bank, and he tells her to call the police.  Susan is somewhat afraid to call the police because of her   background.  See, Susan does not remember 18 years of her life. All that she has been  told is that the family chauffeur,   Saul, dropped her off in Dallas at  Bell View Mental Institute at the age of 8 years old completely catatonic.  <br />  As the investigation begins, everyone is willing to believe and assist  Susan, but with each detail of her psychiatric care   revealed in news  reports, people begin to blame her. She is then left with only the support  of her husband Jeff and   Detective Harry Bronson, the detective assigned  to investigate what happened to little Timmy. Jeff, feeling that he can no    longer trust her, eventually deserts her too. Detective Bronson tells  Susan that he needs her to take a polygraph test   because the District  Attorney's Office had doubts. He assures her that he does believe her, but  that this will help prove she   is innocent of kidnapping her son. <br />  She  begins to feel that her past is connected to her son's disappearance so she  decides to go back to Pine Basin, New   Mexico without telling anyone. She  sets out to answer the questions to her past and hopefully find Timmy.  <br />   The book from the very first page mesmerized me. The author keeps you  hanging on to her every word, and it stays that   way through the entire  book. There are so many ups and downs in the book that you feel like you  are on a roller coaster   ride. This book is filled with characters that  are real to life. My two favorite characters are Susan, who was willing to  risk   life and limb to recover her son, and Detective Bronson, who is a  Columbo-kind of cop that dresses and appearsto be   incompetent, but watch  out for him. He is as sly as a fox and he sticks by Susan the entire time  when even her husband   abandons her. This was a well-written, high-pitched  suspense story with an ending you would not believe.	2000-08-07

At   first it was every once in a while, so Amy  could conceal it sometimes. Then it started getting more intense, causing  Amy   pain in the form of headaches and a permanently stiff neck, and it  became increasingly difficult to hide from anyone. When   her father  noticed the tics, he was angry. The worst was at mealtime. He would watch  her like a sniper and would explode   when there was even the slightest  movement of her head or neck. He would say &quot;you're head's going to  fall off if you don't   cut that out!&quot; Things got worse for Amy. Her  mind lurched and veered in ways she didn't understand; Amy felt that she    must touch wood at all times to ward off harm, and that chewing a wad of  stale gum would prevent a plane crash. She   would save meaningless scraps  of paper, and there were many other occurrences that made Amy feel that she  was crazy. <br />  I believe that anyone can understand Amy's feelings at  having a disease that was undiagnosed for years and what it makes   you  think of yourself and how it effects your whole life. I was so inspired by  the amazing account of Amy's difficult life, and   how she was able to make  it to where she is today.  <br />  A very courageous story.	2000-08-07

I hope to be as  sassy as  she is when I reach her age. <br />  Loretta Jackson and Vickie Britton have  written a mystery/romance that really warms your heart while keeping you on  the  edge of your seat. Best of all, I could recommend it to my 15-year old  niece to read. Good work, Loretta and Vickie. 4 Stars	2000-08-07

The authors let you know you are not alone and we all go through   the same stages of Infidelity.  <br />  Not all affairs are the same, but they are just as  hurtful, nor do they all call for the same response, which does not make    cheating right in any way. Surviving Infidelity will help you to understand  what goes on in a cheaters mind. Here you will find   answers to the many  questions you have. I believe the hardest part to get over is the betrayal.  Every one handles infidelity   differently. Remember: we must never take it  on ourselves, the cheater is wrong.  <br />       Here is a list of subjects  the authors explain to us:         Why affairs happen         Discovery and  its impact         Coping and healing         Dealing with the martial  crisis         Repairing the relationship, if that is what you want          The post affair marriage         Increasing your self-esteem         What  it takes to be a survivor <br />  I noticed this book in a bookstore as I was  searching for a book to improve on myself. Something told me to buy it  because   at the time it fit my life, boy was I glad I did. I realized that  I did not need the fixing because I was the injured party. It is   really  strange but those of us cheated on seem to take the blame for something  that is out of our control. Remember where   the blame lies -- we are the  hurt and damaged ones. Read the book it will really help you pick up the  pieces of your life. It   did me.  <br />  This one earned High Marks from  this reviewer.	2000-07-29

Howard proved that a company could lead with its heart and soul and still  make money.

My Year Off tells us that stroke victims can make a come back, but it is mighty hard, like I  said, no watering down here. As   the readers learn of Robert McCrumb's  story they will feel as if they are traveling the same journey and  experiencing the   same emotions as he.           When Robert McCrumb awoke  the morning of July 29 in 1995 he was unable to move. At the age of 42 he  had a severe   stroke. As Robert thrashed around in bed unable to sit  upright, he wished Sarah; his wife of just 2 months was with him.  He    didn't experienced anxiety about his condition, just irritation and  puzzlement. When a stroke occurs the brain suffers a   hemorrhage infarct;  the body experiences a colossal disturbance of its innate sensory  equilibrium. Robert changed over night   from a walking, talking person  into an incontinent carcass, unable to make any sense out of his body. He  kept passing out   and wetting all over himself.   <br />  As he recuperated  his mornings consented of Sarah showing up at eight in the morning with a  tiny cup with a laxative type   drink and fresh clothes.  She also brought  him the days post and the British newspapers, her addiction not his. Then  he   would be wheeled off by the nurses to have a bath, that was a  laborious and exhausting process during which he tried to   forget that the  nurses were literally manhandling him moving him in and out of a wheel  chair specially designed for use in the   bath room.  <br />  Woven through  the book are excerpts of Robert and Sarah's diaries, the reader is given a  glimpse into their raw feelings and   emotions as they go through this  tragedy.  The reader will hear the self-doubt the patient goes through as  to whether they will   survive or what will become of them, and the  depression that they go through.   <br />  There are so many ranges of  feelings in this one, it rates high on emotions. I found the book open and  honest concerning   strokes and their victims. It's the kind of book we  need on the market to keep us informed. This is an excellent book, one    worth reading whether there is a stroke victim in your family or not.  It's  worth being informed, you will not be sorry.	2000-07-29

Kelly, spent ten years researching the personal and professional characteristics of star performers.  <br />  If you want to do more than just succeed at work, this is the book for you! It's full of vitally information  on how to reach   beyond your skills at work. About ten to fifteen percent  of all people will out perform their peers by a wide margin and rise    above to the star ranks. How to be a Star at Work tells us how to be our  own star and to be able to outshine everyone else,   no matter who you are.  This book has nine strategies to getting ahead, but don't think you can  muddle through with a few   pointers; you need to read the entire book to  be able to realize how everything works and fits together. It's worth the  time   and effort! Remember stars are made not born.  <br />  I found this to  be a helpful, informative, simplistic read. It's very well written and the  fact that the author spent so much time   'in the trenches' is apparent, he  knows what he is talking about. I recommend it.	2000-07-29

To her  surprise, Lillian hired her as   a part-time live-in housekeeper, which  became more than part-time. When Rosemary applied for the job, employment  was   the farthest thing from her mind. Rosemary was really only thinking  of herself. What she really planned was to read, write,   and becoming  great friends with Lillian Hellman. But, Lillian had other ideas for  Rosemary. And what Rosemary got was   something else indeed.   <br />  This  book is about the innocence's of a 17 year-old girl, her touch with reality  and her painful coming of age. At times it's   heart breaking to read,  other times it is uproariously funny. Rosemary Mahoney makes you feel as if  you are her, in her   shoes, living her experiences, and feeling her  emotions.  <br />  It's a good read for those times when you don't want to  concentrate on a story line or try to solve a plot.

This  character is the ultimate bad guy, you get the impression that he has no  good in him at all.     In a wooded area of Northern Virginia a small house  at the end of a gravel road, with its security apparatus and hidden  miniaturized cameras it is being used by the the FBI to interview one of  the most important witnesses the agency has ever had. But a few people know  about the secret meeting, for them a violent drama is about to begin.     Faith Lockhart is the secret witness who must go on the run with Lee Adams,  a man that she does not know and does not trust yet.    Adams and Lockhart  are very likable characters, but I felt that the author didn't develop the  characters enough. I also thought that this book had to much foul language  compared to his other books.    Even with those 2 faults, this was a very  good read.  Don't pass it up.<br />   Davis Baldacci is also the author of  &quot;Absolute Power' which is very good. So if you like &quot;Saving  Faith&quot; get &quot;Absolute Power&quot;.    No wonder that David  Baldacci is always  on the New York Times Best Seller list.	2000-07-29

The 1st was Cimarron Rose in 1997.<br />   When Holland takes on the defense of  Wilbur Pickett, who has had allot of bad luck in his past, now finds  himself accused of stealing bearer bonds from the rich Dietrichs family.     Holland is going up against Dietrichs whom he does not care for because  Dietrich has made a fortune running over people and tainting anyone who  stands in his way.  Plus Holland can not forget the passion he fills for  Dietrichs wife Peggy Jean.    James Burke makes you see the town and  characters in your mind so clearly as he describes them.    The only issue  I had with this book is James Burke talks of rain on 25 pages of this book,  but I find that hard to believe because this book takes place in Texas Hill  country, and Texans know that it hardly ever rains in the Texas Hill  country.  Other than that this book is a winner.    Burke is a master at  setting mood, laying in atmosphere, fall with quirky raunchy language that  befits Texas.

One of the first things Stephanie Tourles book 50 SIMPLE WAYS TO PAMPER YOURSELF points out is the need to   realize our bodies can only take so much. Our  lives are so stress filled these days, we need to be able to release that  stress   or our bodies will go haywire. When we even think about taking  time for ourselves we feel guilty, well, Ms. Tourles tells us   to forget  the guilt and relax because it well help to make us calmer, better people  if we do.  <br />  Did you know that stress restricts blood flow to the skin  preventing moisture and nutrients from getting where they need to   go? Or  that stress promotes the production of the male hormone testosterone, which  stimulates oil production that in turn   promotes pimple formation and  clogged pores?  Stephanie Tourles tells us that lowering our stress level  will dramatically   improve the texture and condition of our skin.  <br />   Ms. Tourles doesn't just fill her feminine readers in on all the  information they need to know to help them understand why   they should  take the time to pamper themselves; she also gives us ways to do it.  <br />   Such as:      Use aromatherapy to relax and recharge in the bath.

She offers a list of 10 top healing foods and ideas on how to nourish  your hair.  <br />  I chose this one to review because I needed it.

IF you think you would like to be a novelist to have glamour, fame,  and fortune, than read on   so that you can persuade yourself to go into  another line of work.  <br />  Frederick Busch knows about the dangers of  writing, he is a best selling author of more than twenty works of fiction  and   non- fiction, but you do not see him on nightly TV.  Busch examines  what makes him and the writers that he admires   including Charles Dickens,  Herman Melville and Ernest Hemingway continue to write in the darkest  hours.  The reason is   simply to share stories.  Busch is the writer of  the sixteen essays that are in the book.  If a writer is honest with  himself, he   hopes that what he writes will be interesting to the readers.   <br />  Called a Notable book of 1998 by the New York Times, A Dangerous  Profession will captivate writers and readers alike,   inspiring them to  pick up books that they would not normally want to read, which has been the  case with me.  I would   recommend this book to any one who likes to read.	2000-07-29

Davis Bunn DoubleDay - June2000 ISBN: 038549615X - Hardcover &lt Marcus Glenwood was a partner ina very prestigious corporate law firm until he was involved in a car accident that killed his children and almost killed his wife, who blames him and is divorcing him. Worst of all he blames himself and is living in his own private hell.  Marcus decides to move back to his hometown of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, into the old Victorian manor that was his grandparents. Little did Marcus know that when he moved back to Rocky Mount, that the biggest and most difficult case of his lifetime would fall into his lap. The church of New Zion is that client. The church was founded with the first earnings of freed slaves, and Marcus successfully stops a court action made by a company that wants the churches historic cemetery relocated so they can build a factory in it's place.  Marcus has won a battle against New Horizons Co., but the war is raging and it will not be so easy this time with the dirty tactics that New Horizons uses.<br /> This book is very well written with lots of lovely, caring characters.  Dee Gautam, who works with Marcus, is a very enigmatic lady who provides Marcus with some very important info. Kristen is a young woman who has suffered her own family tragedy and whom Marcus finds himself drawn to. Charlie Hayes a retired judge and a supportive mentor who will serve as co-counsel.<br /> T. Davis Bunn has a talent for creating a wide range of characters whose humanity and concern for each other is tremendously moving. Thought that the most compelling character of all was Marcus. While writing a thrilling trial filled with surprising twists and shocking revelations, T. Davis Bunn also pens an inspirational work about Marcus's Path to self-forgiveness.  In the church of New Zion, Marcus finds a surrogate family who welcomes him with open arms, helps him go on with his life, and learn to love himself again.<br />Reading The Great Divide was like reading several stories that came together collectedly into a nice tight package. An immense read.  5 stars for sure. Pam Stone	2000-07-04

Bernie Rhodenbarr, bookseller by day and burglar by night, is on the prowl again.  Alice Cottrell has hired him to steal back the letters of reclusive author Gullivar Fairborn from Anthea Landauthe, who is about to put them up for auction.  Bernie breaks into her room to search for the letters, but instead of letters he finds Anthea's dead body, and the cops are not far behind him.  Bernie gathers all the suspects together in one room to see if he can try and weed out the culprit behind the murder that he is accused of.<br /> The Burglar in The Rye is a well-written book, but I had some real problems with it. (1) Every character in the book is involved with the murder, desired letters, or the missing jewels (a subplot).  Telltale clues are left throughout the plot, which enables the reader to guess the outcome too early in the book. (2) Next, Block takes one-liners and turns them into several pages of talk, for instance \\"The Femininity\\" of Bernie's lesbian friend, \\"Carloyn, and Paddington Bear,\\" or any number of dumb drinking jokes. Who really cares about these things?  They didn't have anything to do with the storyline.  Worst of all, the ending of the book is so preposterous; it did not make any sense.  I know that Lawrence Block is a great writer and can write a good book because I read \\"The Hit Man\\" and it was a grand read. Not this one.  Pam Stone END	2000-07-04

There was too much rock-climbing &gt;  for my taste even though I learned something on the subject. I really liked  &gt; the character of Darby; She is energetic and a superhuman woman of  admirable &gt; exploits who overcomes incredible obstacles in the book.  Free Fall is a mix &gt; of suspense, carnage, and even a little humor  thrown in.  Mr. Mills keeps &gt; the reader transfixed and turning pages to  the very spectacular conclusion. &gt;<br />   Pam Stone	2000-07-01
