But instead I found myself frustrated at the way his autobiography blames everyone else for Clinton's problems except himself.  That being said, while his memoirs frustrated me it causes me to read further about Clinton and fill in the many gaps between the truth and what was presented in My Life by Clinton. <br /> <br />An American Journey is a highly readable, truthfull, and ultimately sympathetic look at Clinton's rise to presidency.  The author does not sugarcoat anything and you see the real Bill Clinton: his many strengths and his many weaknesses.  I also enjoyed how the author put the situations Clinton was in into the Context of the times and place.  I really could not stop reading this book.  It is very good and should be read rather than Clinton's memoirs.	2004-11-18

Using documents from the former Soviet Block as well as sources here, the author shows how Reagan defeated communism. <br />The book clearly shows that Reagan was concerned about communism and developed a plan of action from the time he was an actor and that he was far more than the empty suit the liberals will want you to believe.  This was a great book that tells the truth about Reagan, a truth many of us already knew but many on the far left will never admit.  This book should be required reading for anyone interested in recent history. Reagan was a great president and this book shows just one reason why.  Complement this book with the recent collections of Reagan's letters for an accurate portrait of this great leader.	2004-10-24

I feel the same about Nixon, good president, not a good person.  That being said, I am not a Clinton hater, I do not blame him for all the problems in the world like many do.  I probably would have voted for him a third time for President while at the same time, not used him as an example of a good role model.  So I read, My Life, with a fairly open mind.<br />As a teacher, I deal with children who like to make excuses for everything.  That being said, I found My Life a 900 page book of excuses.  From the beginning Clinton sets up the story in a way that blames everyone else for all his flaws and mistakes except himself.  That is what is so frustrating about this book.<br />For example he talks about how the \\"right wing conspiracy\\" went after him about Gennifer Flowers, he talks about how awful it was, he goes on for about 3-4 pages on how the right wing set him up before he admits that he had an affair with her.<br />The whole book is unfortunately like that.  Rather than take some responsibility, he finds excuse after excuse for his actions.  This gets more and more difficult to read as the books shifts from his life to his politics.<br />I really tried to like this book, but could not.	2004-07-19

How the UN was not to thrilled about it.  But the UN isn't the only one who should have been upset, Bill Clinton and his foreign policy team should have been worried as well.  This book is a ground up look at the result of UN and Clinton era foreign policy decisions and mistakes.<br />The book is about three people trying to do the right thing.  A lawyer who decides not to become another shark but lends his skills to monitor elections, a doctor who tries to help people who really need help, and a young woman who gave up the easy life to give back.  I really felt for the three authors and am glad they tried to make positive contributions.<br />Much has been said about the parties, sex, and drug use talked about by the authors while on their UN missions.  This is interesting stuff and interesting to read.  But again, this is small stuff compared to the books overall and first hand look at the results of Clinton policy and UN policy weakness.<br />Anyone who favors an increased role of the UN in American foreign policy decisions needs to read this book.<br />I highly recommend this book	2004-07-19

Not particularly this book, but any modern updated biography of Chiang Kai Shek.  In recent years we have gotten updated biographies of Mao and Ho Chi Minh and now finally Chiang Kai-Shek.<br />First and foremost, this is a well written, well researched book.  It is easy to read and never boring.  So on that sense it is a good biography.  The book also has some great pictures and good maps at the beginning of the book.<br />The book does a terrific job showing the politics going on in China between 1911 and 1945.  The books strongest points about Chiang Kai-Shek are on his battles against the warlords and desires to eliminate the communists.  I also felt the book did a great job discussing his wife, and her famous family the Soongs.<br />That being said, I felt the book was weak in its overall assessment of Chiang Kai-Shek.  I got the impression that the author really did not want to make any strong judgements about Chiang Kai Shek.  He does not hold back any facts, but just does not make strong judgements.  However, the author is highly critical of Sun Yatsen, and General Stillwell.  Two great men in history, this author is not afraid to judge, but Chiang Kai Shek he does not.<br />Sun Yatsen was a great leader and had such a vision for China, but Fenby is highly critical of him.  Stillwell was exactly right on how Chiang Kai-Shek would lose China and was dead on in his assessment of KMT corruption.  Instead, Fenby is critical of Stillwell.  For a better look at Stillwell look at the Recent book on the Burma Road.<br />Also, I was surprized at how rushed the author gets at the end on the ultimate Communist victory.  Fenby is great in discussing the Marshall visit and attempt to broker a peace, but his description of the Nationalist collapse and retreat to Taiwan was rushed in my opinion.  Also, there is little to no information about Chiang Kai Shek on Taiwan.<br />But I am being picky.  I enjoyed this book very much and am glad Fenby wrote it.  Had Chiang Kai Shek been a better leader the history of Asia and the world would be very different.	2004-02-09

Especially if you like fiction about Asia.  Not only did he tell great stories but his books were filled with so much good history and culture about places like China and Japan.  Though I was never a fan of &quot;King Rat&quot; books like Shogun, Tai-Pan, and Noble House were some of the best I ever read.  They were books you never wanted to end.<br />Gai-Jin starts off that way as well.  The first 400 or 500 pages of Gai-Jin are classic Clavell.  Combining many of the stories and characters from Shogun, Tai Pan, and Noble House.  The books first 500 pages are terrific.  Clavell using some familiar faces from his other books sets the stage for the Meiji Restoration in Japan.<br />The book in typical Clavell fashion talks about the history of Japan after the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1853 as well as of China while it was divided up into spheres of influence.<br />Gai-Jin is so good at setting the stage for Meiji with its characters discussing Japan's options of either learning for the Gai-Jin or attempting a futile resistance and facing humilation like China suffered under the Opium Wars.<br />Unfortunately Clavell died shortly after finishing this book.  And unfortunately the affects of his illness affect the second half of the book.  The book just loses focus 1/2 way through. My gut feeling is that Clavell's illness just caught up to him.  Because the book just goes downhill and nowhere which is not typical of Clavell.<br />Clavell will never be replaced.  Other fictional books about Asia do not even compare.  Cloud of Sparrows, The Laura Joh Rowland Books, are ok but not in Clavell's league.  The first half of Gai-Jin reminds us how good he was.  Unfortunately, he will never be replaced.	2004-01-24

First and foremost Oliver North has strong political convictions.  Whether you agree with his politics or not, is your own personal business.  But buyer beware, his politics is a part of this book.<br />Now, if you can look beyond his politics, again whether you agree or disagree, this is a great first hand look at the War in Iraq and a look at being an embedded reporter during this war.<br />Again, politics aside, this is a great primary source reading on both the war and the media coverage of the war.<br />North brings a lot of military experience into his reporting and that is an added plus.<br />The DVD that comes with the book is fantastic.  However, I warn all readers that they should read the book before watching the DVD.  The DVD covers much of the same material in the book, and you will find both the book and DVD more enjoyable if you read before you watch.<br />Again, get over, accept, ignore, North's politics and you have a great book/DVD primary source of the second war in Iraq.<br />This book shows how brave our military is!	2004-01-04

Webster in my opinion does a better job telling his story than Tuchman did in her book, plus Webster has access to more and better balanced sources.  Again, Stilwell and the American Experience is a classic, but The Burma Road is more up to date.<br />The book also shows how difficult Chiang Kai Shek was, and if anyone can not believe how someone like Mao could take over China, just read more about Chiang Kai Shek, he lost China just as much as Mao won it.<br />Anyone who likes WWII or just good easy to read history will enjoy this book.	2003-12-21

What I will say is this.<br />I am a 10th grade teacher and I assigned this book for the first time this year to my 10th grade World History students.  The student reaction to this book was unbelievable.<br />Repeat: I forced students to read a book for a class and they loved it.<br />Actually it was quite unbelievable, both before, during, and after class the students were discussing, and arguing with each other over the book.<br />I even caught kids reading the book in the lunchroom and cafeteria, and study hall!<br />As a teacher my only criticism of the book is that it does not really explain why the Turks targeted the Armenians.  To me that was the one thing this book needed but did not really have.<br />But the best way to sum up how thought provoking and good this book is is a quote from a 70-80 student who told me<br />\\"I normally do not like to read, but I loved this book.\\"<br />A forgotten piece of history that needs to be read, and students will actually like!	2003-12-21

I saw several news people mention this book as one of the best books of the year so I picked it up at the local library and they were right!<br />Franklin and Winston is simply a fascinating look at two of the giant leaders of the 20th century.  Easy to read, filled with great quotes and stories, this is how history is supposed to be written.  I guess since Jon Meacham is a magazine writer and a journalist he is a better writer than say some plain old historians, but whatever the case the man can write and what a story he told.<br />As a teacher, I am thinking about making this book mandatory reading.  It should be.  More young people need to know about these two men, and this book does it.<br />Also this book is timely when one looks at the remarkable relationship between George W. Bush and Tony Blair.  I am not saying Bush is Roosevelt and Blair is Winston, but what I am saying is I get the impression both leaders read an advanced copy of this book or at least know their history.<br />What impressed me the most is how FDR even though Winston was a more trusted leader and a better friend, knew in the post-WWII world that the USSR would be the other big player and for better or for worse using realpolitik FDR knew Stalin and the USSR would ultimately be the bigger players in the upcoming cold war.  Again, of course England and Winston were better allies, but the reality was the USSR was the real power and FDR knew that.<br />My only negative comment would be that i would have liked more information about FDR's condition at Yalta and the effects of any deals or non-deals he made with Stalin.<br />This is a great book and should be bought and read.	2003-11-30

And the answer is not even close.  Shogun is a one of a kind book that probably will never be bested.  Cloud of Sparrows, while taking place at about the same time, is not even as good as Gai-Jin which itself is not one of Clavell's best.  Clavell was very sick when writing Gai-Jin, its only OK, but its still better than cloud of sparrows.<br />with that said, Cloud of Sparrows is not a bad book.  Its like Shogun lite.  Its a decent look at Japan just before Meiji, it has some good characters, and it reads fast.  Its a good summer read with a little history.  If you like Japan you will like this book.  But again its no Clavell.	2003-09-03

Therefore I was very excited when his book came out in paperback, so I could read his story and the story of Delta Force.<br />I mention Rogue Warrior because Haney was a founding member of Delta force, the armies counterterrorism unit and Marchinko was the found of SEAL Team 6, the navy's anti-terror unit.<br />Both books do a great job describing why these units were founded and why we needed these units to protect our freedoms.  But while Rouge Warrior is a great book for being over the top, rude, crude, and boombastic, Inside Delta Force is great while being much more subtle and formal.  These books are like Yin and Yang, but both are great and are must reads.<br />Haney is a brave man and a great writer while keeping everything low key.<br />This is a good book	2003-08-26

The book is huge.  When I brought the book to the pool at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Las Vegas, I had people tell me that is was the biggest book they had ever seen in there lives.  One guy mentioned that the book was longer than the dictionary.  Which is true.  Someone else asked me how you remember characters and events in a book that is so long.  And that is the beauty of this book and its writer James Clavell.<br />Despite being over 1300 pages, Noble House will hold your interest the entire time.  You will not want it to end.  The characters in this book are so great, you will be sad when the book is finally over.<br />The book is about Hong Kong in 1963, it is also a sequal to Tai-Pan and in a way a sequal to King Rat.  It makes references to Shogun as well.  The book is also a history of the cold war, and of Hong Kong and China in the early 1960's.  That is one of Clavell's greatest gifts, the historical background he brings to his Asia saga.<br />This is no quick read, but its a great read and full of great stuff about China and Chinese culture.	2003-05-26

I had a hard time putting this book down.  That being said, the book is o.k. not great.  It is not on the level of a Shogun, still the best Samurai book, and also it is just slightly below the works of Laura Roh like Shinju and Black Lotus.<br />It is a neat little book, not great, not terrible and hard to put down.<br />As to the fiction of it, I do not fully believe the author's intro.  First of all, how can you trust someone that will not put their real name on the book.  Why the fake name?<br />First of all, the Hidden people in this book clearly represents the Christians.  The Persecution of the Hidden in the books is very similar to what happened to Christians early in the Tokugawa Shogunate.  And with that said, who does the bad lord represent in this book?  Could it be Tokugawa?  And the hero, who is a member of the \\"Hidden\\" has a name so close to Hideyoshi.  Hideyoshi, who also rose from nothing, Hideyoshi, who in his last days may have become a Christian?  Like I said, there is a little more here than the author claims.<br />Take this book from the library or buy in paperback.  Do not rush out and buy it.	2003-03-11

First and foremost, 1421 is a great read.  This book is interesting, written with passion, and will make you think.<br />I felt the best thing about 1421 is the job it did on why Zheng He and the Ming Dynasty fleets were shut down, dismantled, and records destroyed.  Menzies answers this question much better than Louise Levathes in &quot;When China Ruled the Seas&quot; and Tsai in the new biography of Zhu Di.  Menzies talks not only about the monetary and human costs of maintaining such a large fleet, but more importantly ties it into the Mandate of Heaven and the Dynastic cycle.  Menzies shows how something like a lightening strike and a fire can be seen as losing the Mandate of Heaven and thus a reason to change your ways.<br />Now its pretty much undisputed that the Chinese made it to the Southern Tip of Africa.  This is in the standard history books, the question is did they reach north and south america and australia like Gavin Menzies asserts.<br />The bottom line is based on one book, we can not answer this question.  Menzies makes a strong case, a case that makes you think, but its not a slam dunk or a closed case.  I think it will take more time and more historians and archeologists to answer that question.<br />The evidence is interesting.  Plants in north and south america that came from Asia, language, DNA, animals.  Almost a columbian exchange from China.  The discussion of maps, wrecked ships, journals, Menzies knowledge of the seas.  All make for a good case, but I need more.<br />I highly recommend this book.  Think about its conclusions and let's see where this all leads.  I also recommend reading this along with Blue Latitudes by Tony Horwitz which is about Captain Cook.  Think about all that Zheng He and Cook accomplished.  Two incredible, larger than life, and all to human heroes of history.	2003-02-18

I cannot tell you how excited I was to see, purchase, and read this book.  A biography of Will Adams, the real Blackthorne from James Clavell's Shogun.  The man who befriended Tokugawa Ieyasu.  I didn't hesitate to buy it and I couldn't wait to read it.  The inside cover even said this was the story behind &quot;Shogun.&quot;  There is so little available in English about this time period and Ieyasu Tokugawa's unification of Japan, I was so happy to finally see something.<br />Don't get me wrong, its not a bad book.  It is just not the book it says it is.  The book is only partially about Will Adams and Tokugawa Ieyasu and is more a general look at the first English, Dutch, and Portuguese in Japan.  Interesting, yes, but the true story behind &quot;Shogun&quot; no.<br />Even the bibliography does not recognized the second of two English biographies of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the one by Conrad Totman, which is fantastic.<br />Its a neat little book, with some interesting historical characters and quotes, but of its 300 pages i would say less than 1/2 are devoted to Will Adams.<br />Tokugawa Ieyasu was one of the most important people in Japanese history.  Will Adams story is one of the most interesting in history.  They are still waiting for their story to be told.<br />Take this book out of the library, I don't recommend buying it.

I enjoyed the mix of social commentary and travel essay.  Therefore it was with great pleasure that I sat down to read his biography of Abraham.<br />Do not be fooled by the small size of this book.  Just because it is a short book do not think this is a light book.  I was surprized at how deep this book is.  Perhaps after 9-11 or perhaps after his previous trips to the Middle East as in Walking the Bible, whatever the inspiration is, Feiler has written a deep, thought-provoking look at Abraham and what unites and divides all three monotheistic religions.<br />It is a short book and will not take too much time to read, but the consequences of what the book brings up will keep you talking and your mind working.

Brady writes of interesting people, governments, and cultures as he rides his mountain bike in the footsteps of Marco Polo and other Silk Road traders.<br />The book is a fast read, and as a teacher I enjoyed his descriptive passages about the specific geography of the Silk Road.<br />Though the main focus of the book seems to be the Chinese portions of the Silk Road, readers will find his descriptions of the Taliban in Afganistan back in around 1998 quite chilling.  I hope he will write a new afterward about his experience with the Taliban an Afganistan after 9-11.  He was there just as they were taking power.<br />This is a good little adventure book with a good mix of history, politics, and geography.<br />If you liked books like Iron and Silk you will like this book.<br />I look forward to reading about his next bike trip.<br />Also you can e-mail the author about the book which  I think is a great thing to do.

Confederates in the Attic is simply one of the best book in recent memory.  It was by chance that I read that masterpiece of race relations and the legacy of the civil war by Tony Horwitz and I am thankful that I did.  In Confederate in the Attic Horwitz educates the reader on race relations in this country while on the outside simply telling the story of civil war actors and talking of his roadtrips down south.  After reading Confederates, I have been waiting for Tony's next book and we have been rewarded with the awesome Blue Latitudes.<br />Like Confederates in the Attic, you read Blue Latitudes at first as his goofy trip on a replica of the Endevor or the funny stories about his drunk friend from Australia.  But like all of Tony's books, it is deeper than you think.  Between the lines is the story of cultural encounter and its lasting effects.  You enjoy reading Horwitz's works and laugh out loud at times, but when you think about it he is raising big questions and important subjects.<br />I highly recommend not only reading this book, but trying to see Tony on his book tour.

I ended up buying the book an hour later.<br />The stories are unforgetable.  They hit the whole range of emotions.  I had tears in my eyes reading these accounts.<br />This is really an important piece of history and should be read by everyone.  The accounts range from witnesses, police, fire, volunteers, family members, office workers.  Each story is unique and provides a different point of view, but they are all powerful first hand accounts.<br />Buy this book, read it, and share it with people.	2002-08-24

This is a great novel and I recommend it very highly.  There is so much to talk about with this novel on so many levels.  It is part biography of Adm. Nelson, it is part obsession and how we look at famous people whether historical, sports, movies etc., and it is a disturbing look at mental illness.<br />Though the narrator in this book is obsessed with Adm. Nelson you can substitute any historical person or famous person.  When does liking someone so much become harmfull to our mental well being?<br />I don't want to give too much away, but this is a great read.	2002-08-10

In Russia it helped to cause a failed revolution and planted the seeds for 1917.  For Japan it was a major victory, evidence to the success of the modernization they started after the Meiji Restoration, and a step towards WWII and Pearl Harbor.  For the rest of Asia the nationalism this war created had tremendous effects.  The Russo-Japanese war saw an Asian Nation defeat a European nation for the first time.  China, Vietnam, nations across Asia had increased nationalism after this conflict.<br />Yet in English there is so little written on the Russo-Japanese War. As other reviewers stated, this conflict is awaiting the definative history.  Because of the lack of materials on the Russo-Japanese war, it was with great interest and excitement that I read the Tsar's Last Armada.<br />I enjoyed the beginning of this book very much.  The author does a great job setting the stage and going into the personalities of the major players.  Yes, as others have stated, the author is not a native english speaker, but I still enjoyed his style and background stories.  And yes, I understand that the book is telling the Russian side of the story.<br />Surprisingly where the book goes downhill is on the actual voyage and battle.  The narrative just could not continue how good it was in the beginning of the book.<br />I appreciate someone writing about this important event, but unfortunately, we must wait for a better more complete book on the conflict.	2002-07-02

Instead of taking the Lonely Planet Books which I had done to past trips to China, and England I went with the Rough Guide.  What a mistake.  Such a mistake that about 1/2 through the trip, somewhere in Thailand I think, I threw the book out and picked up LP guides to Vietnam and Cambodia.<br />The Cambodia book is great.  Great information, easy to follow guides to Angkor what else could you need.  LP really tells it as it is.  Cambodia is a place changing everyday.  Fortunately for the last year or two its been relatively calm and tourist friendly.  How long this will last is anyone's guess.  I hope stablity have finally come to this country with such a tragic history.<br />Angkor is a unbelievable place and the LP book will get you through it and teach you a lot.<br />Get this book before you go!	2002-07-02

If you read this book you will see how little Clancy knows about China.  Therefore it was refreshing to see Terrence Cheng's novel Sons of Heaven.  Though, ultimately I was disappointed with the book, it will be nice to see a possible best seller or a book that could reach a wide audiance that knows the real China.<br />That being said, my favorite parts of this book are the parts told from the point of view of Deng Xiaoping.  His memories from the cultural revolution and nightmares about Mao were so excellently told by Cheng.  One has to wonder, based on what Deng went through, his memories of students protesting and revolting, how much this could have played in his decision to use force in 1989.<br />The first half of the book, in my opinion is the better half.  The opening and the events leading up to the massacre are very well done.  I felt the book faltered with the actual crackdown and the end.  I felt the book lost a lot of steam beginning with the tanks clearing the square.<br />This is an interesting book, worth a read, but not a classic in my opinion.  But again, at least it knows China	2002-06-29

Every so often you find a biography that reads better than fiction.  Every once in a while you find a non-fiction author who makes history come alive...Robert Massie has done it twice.  I did not think it would be possible to write a book as good as Nicholas and Alexandra...but his Peter the Great is on the same level if not better.  Kinda like trying to debate whether godfather I is better than II or vice versa.  Like Manchester's Macarthur or Mccoullough's Harry Truman this book was a pleasure to read, you learn, and never want it to end.<br />Not only do we learn about Peter and Russia, this book is equally as informative about Charles XII, William of Orange, and the Ottoman Empire.<br />All I can say is READ THIS BOOK!	2002-06-22

A great look at the modern military and our militaries job in places like the Balkans and in these other 3rd world conflicts.<br />The main character in this story is right out of a Nelson Demille book.  He could have been the main character of Plum Island or Up Country, but regardless it still works.<br />This is a great book and a fast read.  I enjoyed that the main characters father in the book was wounded in the rear, i wonder if the author is making a joke about the relationship with his father, the famous general and politician Alexander &quot;I'm In Charge Here&quot; Haig.<br />I enjoyed this book and it is worth your money	2002-04-19

Ellegood International Publications)	Books	4	12	14	N	Y	Highly Readable Look at Emperor Yongle	Shih Shan Henry Tsai has done something that Jonathan Spence has not been able to do: write a book that people can read and understand.  No offense to Spence, I know he is considered the man for Chinese history, but maybe he is a better speaker than writer, because I can't get through any of his books and I have a strong background in Chinese History.<br />Professor Tsai has taken primary and secondary sources about the second Ming Emperor or third depending on how you look at it and turned it into a interesting, well written, little book.  The book is only about 200 pages and it is a quick read, but at the same time highly informative.<br />I did not know much about the Ming Dynasty or Emperor Yongle before reading this book, but now I do.  To me a good history book is one where you learn things you did not know before, and this book did that.<br />I recommend this book highly to anyone who enjoys Chinese history.  And if you want to read a more modern history of China look at Mandate of Heaven by Orville Schell.	2002-04-04

Pico Iyer's the Lady and Monk about Japan, Simon Winchester's look at China on the Yangtze, am's bike ride through Vietnam, and Mark Salzman's two year stay in China in Iron and Silk.  I was hoping the two recent additions to this field would be added to the list: Rivertown and the Ultimate Journey.<br />Rivertown was a well written fast read that did capture todays China.  Unfortunately, i felt the book and story ultimately lacked a story or even an ultimate point.<br />Ultimate Journey at times is a much better book when it is a travel narrative.  Where I lost interest in the book was the very deep discussions of Buddhism.  But I can not fault the author for that because technically this book is shelved in the religion section and not the travel section.<br />Bernstein's provides a great history of Hsuan Tsang and his journey to India and back to find Sutras.  I also enjoyed his feelings towards his future wife.  but again, too many times i got lost into discussions on Buddhism.<br />A very good book, but no Iron and Silk!	2002-03-29
US	52479865	R1IK0D8NIMXP20	0060953748	154462447	River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze	Books	3	40	61	N	N	The New Iron and Silk???	To me, the classic book of an American's experience in China is Mark Salzman's Iron and Silk.  However, it can be argued that it is dated.<BR>     Salzman visited China back in 1982 and was one of the first American's to visit after we re-established relations with the mainland.  Also, Salzman was no ordinary visitor.  He spoke Chinese and was a martial arts expert.  So, he was not exactly the common American and China is no longer the China of 1982.<BR>   With this in mind, I anxiously awaited for the paperback of Rivertown.  It was reviewed so well by so many book reviewers.  Finally, an updated version of Iron and Silk.  An American, a more ordinary American in China in 1996-1998...today's China.<BR>    I have been fortunate enough to make two visits to China, most recently a quick trip in 2001, but I had my more intense and lengthy experience back in 1998 the same time the author of Rivertown Peter Hessler was there.  So this is the China that I remembered.  However, my month in China is a very different stay than Hessler's two years in China.<BR>     To the books credit, it is a smooth read.  In fact, it is quite pleasurable to read and I could not put it down.  Hessler hits on some many things that my group of Asia hands, and my crew has made multiple trips throughout Asia can remember.  Hessler has captured today's China.<BR>     However there is a saying about writing about China.  They say if you visit China for a week you can write a book.  If you visit for a month you can write an article.  If you visit for a year, you can write a newspaper story.  And if you stay for longer than a year, you will see so many contradictions to what you thought you knew about China that you could not effectively write anything.  And that to me is the problem with Rivertown.<BR>   In many ways the book is about nothing. We see, smell, and feel China.  Yet, at the same time we do not learn much.  And in the end, I barely knew the author.  To me, Salzman's book had a point, where this book was a great descriptive book but really was about nothing.  Hessler talks about being chased by women in China, but come on for two years he had no romance?  Even the visit of his father to China was anti-climatic.<BR>  So, in short this book in my mind, while worth reading does not take the place of Iron and Silk as being the book about China.<BR>  For a modern travel experience in China, by modern i mean up to date check out the River at the Center of the World by Simon Winchester.  Winchester, took a journey up the Yangtze River and it is an awesome look at modern China, Chinese history, travelling, and the author himself.  Winchester did, what Hessler didn't: paint China but doing it using history, geography, and personal challenges.<BR>   If you are going to China you should read this book, but only after Iron and Silk and the River at the Center of the World.	2002-03-11

Kaplan is in my opinion the best when it comes to explaining why the world is the way it is.  Whether it is his articles in the Atlantic Monthly or his classic books like Balkan Ghosts or The Ends of the Earthy, no one writes better, or makes better observations about the current world then Kaplan.  His views are scary and unfortunately right on the mark.  His predictions about the Balkans and Central Asia have unfortunately been true.  With that in mind, I wish more politicians would read his works.  Again, if anyone wants to understand the current world situation just read any of his books.<br />With that in mind, Warrior politics is a book about how to learn from the past to help us have a better future.  Kaplan looks at early Greek and Roman Historians, Sun Tzu, Winston Churchill, and Thomas Malthus to explain how to handle current situations.  Asides from just being well written, asides from being good history, it is a great blue print of how the US can respond to current events in the world.<br />It is a short book.  You can read it in two days.  But it will make you think for a long time after you read it.<br />I am thankful for people like Robert D. Kaplan, Henry Kissinger, and Samuel Huntington for explaining the world without worrying about political correctness.	2002-03-02

If Nelson Demille's Up Country and James Webb's Lost Soldiers are any indication, a new type of Vietnam book may be the veteran returning to Vietnam to confront all the emotions involved in the war and their experiences.  Just as`many of the newer books on the holocaust now deal with the children of survivors, maybe the new Vietnam war books will focus on the returning vet.<br />Early this year, James Webb, author of the classic Fields of Fire wrote Lost Soldiers.  Demille has just released Up Country.  In many ways they are the same book.  A Vietnam War veteran with unresolved issues and emotions towards the war, returns to Vietnam.  In both books the main character return to present Vietnam to solve murders that took place during the war.  Well actually Up Country is supposed to take place in 1997 and Lost Soldiers takes place now.  And the case can be made that 2001 Vietnam has progressed greatly from 1997.  I am not a veteran, I am only 29, but I went to Vietnam in the Summer of 2001 with a groups of New York Teachers.<br />The main thrust of both books is the same.  The main character solves a crime from the past and at the same time comes to grip with the past.  I asked Mr. Demille at a recent book signing about the timing of both books, so similar and so close in release time.  He told the audience that despite having the same agent as Webb that it was not a planned thing.<br />So which book is better?  Let me stop and say both books are great and should be read.  Anyone interested in Vietnam or just a good book should read both.  In fact, they should be read one after the other for full effect.<br />Demille and Webb are both great writers.  Webb's recent Emperor's General about General MacArthur was one of the best books i have ever read.  Demille: Gold Coast, Word of Honor, Rivers of Babylon, Lion's Game...need I say more?  Demille's books are the best.  Again, both books are great but Up Country has a better story.  It will hook you from beginning to end.  However, Lost Soldiers I feel does a better job showing modern day Vietnam and shows a better understanding of the Vietnamese people.  I think that is ultimately the difference, Up Country is more exciting but is clearly lighter.  Demille shows Vietnam and has Vietnamese characters, Demille himself fought there and returned for a visit.  But, his book is an adventure book with some good stuff about modern day Vietnam and a veteran coming to grips with it.  Webb's Lost Soldiers is a better book about veterans, modern Vietnam and the Vietnamese people but its story is too simple.  Lost Soldier's is a great book about todays Vietnam and the feeling of veterans with an ok story.  Think of the summer we had two meteor disaster movies.  Armedgeddon was the more fun and less serious movie while Deep Impact was less fun but much more a thinking man's movie.  That is Up Country and Lost Soldiers.  Up Country is typical Demille, great story, easy to read, with a message.  Lost Soldiers is more a message with a story.<br />Again, both books are great.  I am not a veteran so veterans will be able to compare the two much more accurately than I can.  Having been to Vietnam, Lost Soldiers reminded me of what I saw more than Up Country did.  But ultimately, Up Country was a better read.  In short, check out both books.  Great books, by great writers.  And check out the other books by Webb and Demille.	2002-02-17

How do you rate Righteous Victims?  It is a difficult question, and not an easy thing to do.  So much of what people have written here is true.  This book is everything that has been written here.<BR>     The book is highly readable.  The book is as up to date as possible.  It goes to the election of Ariel Sharon.  The book has so much information it can be exhaustive at times.  And yes, the book at times seems very sympathetic to the Palestinians and the Arabs.  There are many examples of the author leaning a bit in that direction.  HOwever, the author does make it clear in many places as well that the Palestinians and many of the Arab nations and extremists other than Egypt and Jordan have been against the peace proccess and are very anti-event the very existance of Israel.<BR>  so is the book pro-palestinian?  at times yes, but i think it is part of a bigger picture and goal of showing all sides and angles of the situation.<BR>  The bottom line about this book or any history book is whether or not you learn new things by reading it.  This book is not perfect.  I do not agree with everything in this book, but this book taught be a lot about the situation, this book made me think, and this book exposed me to some point of views and historical facts i was not aware of.<BR>   Ultimately, this book taught me a lot about what is going on in the Middle East and that fact alone made it a good read.	2002-01-12

But I was drawn to this book, after reading a very positive review for it in the New York Times.  The Times was right on the money when it said that besides being a great story, it is a thought provoking look at the Global Economy and the 3rd World.  It was in many ways a fiction version of the book Jihad vs. McWorld or the Clash of Civilizations.<br />The book draws you in slowly.  It is slow at first but deceptively so.  It draws you deeper and deeper into the story.  And without even realizing it, you can not put the book down.<br />But unlike many page turners, this one is a highly intelligent and thought provoking book.<br />This book is great for people looking for a good novel or someone looking to see a startling view of the problems in modern Africa.<br />This was a great book	2001-11-20

Cambodia is great for finding bootleg copies of any books on Cambodia.<br />Shawcross has written a well documented, researched, and written book on Cambodia's role in the Vietnam War.  It was easy to read and it certainly made you think.<br />Unfortunately, I disagree with the tone of the book.  And ultimately I disagree with the author's point of view.

The story of a terrorist attack on the white house is unforunately not as unrealistic these days as one would have hoped.  In the current context, it is even more interesting to read this book.<br />It is not a serious novel, it is not a deep novel. But if you are looking for a good non-stop thriller to read on the plane or train this is a good pick.

I am a school teacher who is 29 years old, I was born after the war, and none of my family was involved in the war.  So I read Lost Soldiers with that background.  A history teacher with a lot of book knowledge of the war, but someone too young to have lived through it and without any family members touched by it.<br />I found the book to be amazing.  I had just been to Saigon and Bangkok and the book brought me right back.  It has the smells and tastes of modern Vietnam.<br />I have enjoyed Webb's other works very much.  The Emperor's General is one of the best historical fiction books I have ever read.  Fields of Fire is a classic book on the war.  Again, classic from the point of view of someone who has never been in the military, so if a veteran disagrees with that, I do not have a leg to stand on.<br />The parts of Lost Soldiers that I felt didn't work were the side story action.  How salt is finally caught and brought down to me was insignificant to the rest of the story.<br />In my opinion this story truely captures modern southeast Asia.  It also captures the thoughts of those of us who love Asia.  Having travelled to Asia many times, having many friends who have travelled just as much, and having friends who taught there and married local women I know first hand about this love of Asia, its customs, its history, and even its women.  This book captured all of it.<br />Again, the vet stuff there are others who know much better than I do.  But as a history teacher, as someone who loves Asia, as someone who has recently been there.  this was a great book.<br />Webb is a great writer and this is an important book.	2001-11-15

I am a huge Tom Clancy fan and I have a huge interest in Chinese politics and history.  I am a Global History teacher who has made two trips to China and has participated in many conferences and workshops on the PRC.<br />Perhaps if I did not know anything about contemporary China, I would have really enjoyed this book.  It is a fun book to read, it is a fast read, and has a good story.  However, this book and Clancy's descriptions of China show a clear lack of any understanding of China outside of watching O'Reilly factor and listening to some of the phone callers to right wing talk radio.<br />Clancy has surprizingly incorporated every stereotype of modern day China.  I was just very surprized at this.  Clancy is an intelligent writer, who deals with very intelligent plots.  But his views on China seem based on political sound bites and not on anything close to the way China really is.<br />I remember during the spy plane crisis a caller was on Fox news saying how they were doing their part to support our servicemen by boycotting not just Chinese made goods, but also Chinese food!  Fortunately the Fox news anchor pointed out that the people running a Chinese restaurant had escaped communism and were not part of the PRC.  However, this is the type of stuff Clancy based much of his plot on.  He characters even make similiar references to this.<br />I am a conservative who is strongly anti-communist.  But, having the little bit of knowledge that I do have of China ruined this book for me and has affected the way I view Clancy.  I really like Tom Clancy books, I know a lot of people read his books, I know Clancy is an intelligent guy.  However, this book really does a disservice.  I know it is fiction, but still Clancy has a big readership and he should have done a better job on China.<br />For Asian Fiction read James Clavell, not Tom Clancy.	2001-08-13

I recently visited Vietnam and brought along with me this book to read.  The book had good reviews on it from Dale Dye and the reviews were very positive on Amazon here.  I was looking forward to reading a good novel on Vietnam while in Vietnam.  Unfortunately, I took this book with me.  Even being in Vietnam while reading it, this book was still terrible.<br />I say this book was terrible because it had little story, little plot, and was difficult to follow chronologically.  Basically, there was no story and little else redeeming about this book.<br />I respect all our vets.  I was born when the war ended, but I still appreciate what our vets did over there.  However, I only know what it was like based on reading, I was not there so if people who were there find this book realistic I respect that.<br />But with that said, I thought the book was terrible.  I care less about the money I paid for the book than for the time I wasted reading it.  I can never get that time back.<br />This book was a big waste of time and money.	2001-08-12

It was a great trip and I highly recommend visiting Vietnam to anyone who enjoys travelling in Asia.<br />With that said, I feel that during a trip to Vietnam, the Lonely Planet book is absolutely one of the most important books to have, to read before you go, to look at while you are there, and to reflect back upon when you get home.<br />The book was great.  It was so good, that I was constantly passing it up and down the bus to other people on the trip.  Everyone used it, and to my surprize there were some people that had never used a Lonely Planet book.  LP is the best, and they have never let me down.  There Vietnam book is no exception.<br />If you are going to Vietnam, buy and use this book.<br />It is a great purchase.	2001-08-12

You may think Kissinger is the modern day Prince Metternich or the modern day Napoleon III.  You may read this book and say to yourself, Kissinger is saying exactly what we should do, or is giving the wrong advice on foreign policy.  You can argue any of these points.  You can love Kissinger or hate him.  You can agree or disagree.  But what you can not deny about Dr. Kissinger or his book is that he knows foreign policy and diplomacy and his ideas right or wrong are food for very serious thought.<br />I am not going to lie and say this book is as exciting as John Grisham or Tom Clancy.  It is not.  Nor is it as exciting as Diplomacy was.  And yes, Diplomacy is an exciting and masterful book.  And his chapter on Europe is extremely dry. But the information giving, the background, the possible solutions are very important to read, understand, and debate.<br />Kissinger's whole premise of the book to is the need for America to have a long range, well thought out foreign policy.  Whether you agree with what he says about how this policy should be shaped is debatable.  But what he makes a strong case for in his introduction and throughout the book is the need to have a foreign policy with specific goals, and not a foreign policy based on public opinion at the moment and by the seat of your pants.  I think, right or left, realpolitik or Wilsonian we can all agree with that.<br />Again, I felt his chapter on Europe was dry but he makes up for it with his chapter on Asia.  His thoughts on China, Taiwan, and India to me were the most interesting of the book.  Also, in light of the recent events in the Middle East I was glad to read his thoughts on the situation between Israel and the Palestinians.  <br />I will not recap Kissingers ideas, but again go back to the premise of the book.  America needs a foreign policy, a well thought out one.  We can argue Balance of Power, realpolitik, Wilsonian, etc. all day.  We can argue howto handle Russia, Brazil, Israel, China, South Africa all day.  But we should all look beyond Kissingers specifics, the guy knows his stuff but I agree his specifics are open for debate.  But what we can all agree on, what I think Kissinger is calling for is a foreign policy that is thought out and serves the best interest of the US around the world and not a foreign policy based on CNNY polls and media spin.<br />Again, not a light read.  Not the most exciting read.  But an informative and thought provoking read.<br />And if you have not read Diplomacy by Kissinger, read that as well.	2001-06-02

A great white killing 4 people along the Jersey Shore and in Matawan Creek in 1916.  It is an awesome and frightening story.<br />Close to Shore is the more stylish of the two books, but the author clearly does not have the passion for sharks and the story that the author of 12 Days of terror has.<br />Do not get me wrong.  This is a good book.  It is a fast read and provides not just a good look at the shark attack but the culture of the Jersey shore at that time.  But it is clear from reading both books that the author of closer to shore does not know sharks like the author of twelve days of terror.<br />I felt 12 Days of Terror told the same story, with more passion, and with a lot more primary source material, pictures, and information about sharks in general.<br />My advice is this: take this book out of the library but by Twelve Days of Terror.	2001-05-18

I was always interested in the story of a Great White Shark attack along the Jersey Shore.  It is mentioned in all the shark books, referenced in Jaws, and shown on the Discovery channel.  It is a story I have always been interested but could never find any whole books about.  And what did I see in the book store???  Not one but TWO books on the subject.<br />So now the the question was which one to buy.  I read parts of both and quickly discovered that Dr. Fernicola clearly seemed to know more about sharks and the subject.  Not to knock the other book, but Fernicola's book shows a deeper knowledge of sharks and the incident of 1916.<br />Needless to say, it only took 3 days to read this entire book.  It is so interesting.  He does a great job describing the times and historical background.  He does a great job telling about the attacks.  He does a great job discussing sharks and theories about sharks.<br />The book is well written.  It has great information on the 1916 attacks and the times they took place in.  It is also a great lesson on sharks in general.<br />I have family on the Jersey shore and it amazes me that this could take place there.  Plus in a creek miles from the ocean...YIKES!<br />This was a book I read cover to cover and immmediatly passed on to friends.<br />Anyone who likes sharks, shark week on TV, or JAWS will love this book.	2001-05-13

It is the classic travel adventure to an exotic land.  It is a bit of history and culture in its description of modern Vietnam.  It is a look at family and life in Vietnam and in America.  And it is a book about dealing with the loss of a loved one.  And in each thing this book does it is a masterpiece.<br />The previous reviews are right on the money.  From the moment you pick up this book you can not put it down.  I found myself reading this book every moment I had.  In the library, on the front porch, while waiting for diner to finish cooking, even while my students were taking a test.  Even if I could only read a page or two I did.<br />I recently read a terrible book on modern Vietnam called Shadows and Wind.  After reading that book, I did not have half the sense of what it is like in modern Vietnam as I did from Catfish and Mandala.  I am going to Vietnam this summer and I am glad I read this book before I went.<br />I do not want to give anything away that happens in this book.  I can only say that if you are looking for a great book.  A great book that will take you to a far off land.  Read this book.  It is a travel classic on the level of Iron and Silk, the Lady and the Monk, and the River at the Center of the World.<br />A great and thought provoking read about Vietnam, family, and life.	2001-04-27

Dale Dye has been the technical advisor for almost every big budget war movie of the last decade.  Platoon and Saving Private Ryan are just two of the many films he has advised on.  In addition to serving as the technical advisor he usually has a small role in each of these films.<br />But he is not just a technical advisor and actor.  Dale Dye is an excellent writter as well.  His novelization of Platoon was excellent.  As well as his book Outrage which was a look at the Marines in Lebanon.<br />Run Between the Raindrops was Dye's book on the Battle of Hue.  The book is very moving, does a great job describing the battle, and is written by someone who was there and knows what he is talking about.<br />I do not know how to get a hold of this book anymore.  But if you do get it and read it.  Dale Dye is a great writer and Walk Between the Raindrops is a great book.	2001-04-21

All American's view Vietnam as a Vietnam War movie and all French people see it as Indochine.  And it does not stop there, all other writers about Vietnam do not know what they are talking about.  Yeah, Stanley Karnow, Neil Sheehan, Francis FitzGerald you don't know a thing either.  And guess who the only guy who knows anything about Vietnam is?  ROBERT TEMPLER!  HE LIVED IN VIETNAM for THREE WHOLE YEARS AND HE KNOWS EVERYTHING!  Well, that is what Robert Templer wants you to think!  Shadows and Wind, which is occasionally interesting, is an arrogantly written and suprizingly boring look at Vietnam.<br />The whole beginning of the book is Templer lecturing the reader on how bad the scholarship is on Vietnam and how he knows the real Vietnam.  However after making such bold claims the book bogs down into some really boring chapters about what should be some interesting information about Vietnam.  Basically pages 80-282 is a waste.<br />The book does get interesting at point.  I enjoyed the chapters on the role of food in Vietnamese culture and the relationship between China and Vietnam.<br />I generally love books like this.  The combination history, travel narrative.  But boy, Templer is boring.<br />The topics he brings up are interesting: AIDS in Vietnam, the state of the communist party in Vietnam, life in Hanoi, young people...but he finds a way to present it in a non-interesting way.<br />But again, if you are going to bash other peoples views and writings about Vietnam, please back it with a good book.  This is not a good book<br />Reading through the current Lonely Planet or Rough Guide will give you a better picture of Vietnam today.	2001-04-19

The book gives a devestating look at the land reform campaign of the 1950's.<br />The bottom line is the book is well translated and easy to read.  And it gives us a look at Vietnam most of us have never seen before.  It is a good read and makes you think!	2001-04-10

It is a decent book with some interesting information about exploration in Cambodia and Laos.<br />The book starts off a little slow but gets much better as it tells the stories of explorers from Europe attempting to navigate the Mekong River.  I had never heard of some of these guys and there stories were very interesting.  <br />However,  I was surprized that the stories were mostly about Laos and Cambodia and not much was written about Vietnam.<br />I was also surprized at how light the chapters dealing with the war in IndoChina and their aftermaths were.  He never goes into deep detail about anything.  What he writes about is interesting but it never gets into anything beyond the surface.  I understand this is not a book about the war, but on the otherhand he does not reveal enough of his own experiences to make this fully a travel book.<br />I feel the book gets muddled again towards the end while discussing the impacts of building dams along the Mekong.  The author repeats himself quite a bit at this point.  I also felt his conclusions were a little weak, again not really revealing anything<br />The bottom line on the book is this: it is interesting in parts and is decent enough reading.  But I do not recommend dropping everything and reading it.  It is not horrible, but at the same time it is not THE book on Southeast Asia.	2001-03-30

I had always thought I knew a lot about the Vietnam War.  However, after reading this book I realized that I might know some dates, facts, names, and generalizations but I did not know the human cost of the war.<br />I think for many of us, we know why our guys were there, we know that many Americans had different opinions about the war, we know about the Tet Offensive and maybe the Tonkin Gulf incident but I never realized that I did not know about the many battles fought over there and I certainly did not know how bloody they were.<br />In graphic and moving detail the authors of this book use personal experiences and the voices of others who were there to tell the story of Ia Drang.<br />We can debate the politics of the war for ages.  We can debate how the war was fought forever.  One thing we can not debate is how brave the soldiers who fought there were.  And this book clearly shows that.	2001-03-25

In preparing for my summer trip to Vietnam a number of people suggested reading The Quiet American.  The story also caught my interest when I heard film crews are currently in Vietnam shooting a remake of the film.  A remake which will hopefully be more loyal to the book and its message unlike the earlier version.<br />Talk about foreshadowing.  Greene writes and makes a strong case against American involvement in Vietnam.  And he makes this case back in the 1950's towards the end of French involvement in Indochina.<br />The book is well written and easy to read.  The story is not dated at all.  I only wish President Kennedy and LBJ and their advisors had looked at this book... the books message was all too true.<br />The Viking critical edition comes with some awesome extra stuff including works about and by Greene, great primary sources on Vietnam, and some great background info.<br />As a movie buff, I enjoyed some of the writings that compared the book and the movie.<br />This is a book that deserves the title of classic.	2001-02-26

Short's excellent look at Mao, Bix's bio of Hirohito, and a tough but neccessary read on Ataturk.  After all of that reading and bucks spent on books I was looking forward to reading some fun stuff.  But how could any good global studies teacher pass a new biography of Ho Chi Minh.  He, like Ataturk, has only been on every New York State Global Regents for the last 6 years!  And I certainly could not resist after seeing Duiker on c-span discussing the book.<br />First and foremost...is it a good book?  YES!  It was very informative and highly readable once you made it past the opening chapters and got used to reading the endless Vietnamese names.  Also, please note that while the book is readable, it is not a fast read.  This book took me over three months to read, and I am a pretty avid reader with a decent background in Vietnamese history.  So be warned, great book but time consuming.<br />The book is well researched and documented.  To me the highlights of the book dealt with Ho Chi Minh's political views, his history as a communist in not just Vietnam, but France, and the USSR.  I enjoyed learning about all his various identities and all the places he travelled.  But the best parts of the book I felt dealth with Ho Chi Minh at the end of WWII and his attempts to gain independence for Vietnam, his attempts to win over US support, and to negotiate with the French. Duiker did a great job with this time period.  Also, Duiker points out which I did not know, how much more radical other members of the Vietnamese revolutionary movement were by the 1960's.  I had always thought he was in complete charge like a Stalin or Mao and had no idea about the various leaders and views to surface towards the end of his life.<br />Duiker also does a great job discussing how Ho tried to deal with both the Russians and Chinese.  Anyone who stills believes in a singular monolethic communism should read this.<br/>But the big question...was Ho more communist or more nationalist?  Should the US have supported Ho like a Marshall Tito in Asia?  Duiker does an awesome job on this.<br />Yes, HO was a communist.  Ho was an active communist in Vietnam, France, and even studied in the USSR.  Ho believed in communism and felt the capitalist system would collapse.  Duiker shows how Ho's growing up under French colonialism lead to his views on capitalism and communism.<br />However, Ho was a nationalist also.  Ho clearly did everything he could to gain independence for Vietnam.  He even courted the US and even negotiated as much as he could with the French.<br />Duiker shows clearly that Ho was both.  He was a nationalist and a communist, not one or the other but both.  Duiker also points out that Ho Chi Minh felt a world wide communist revolution was going to happen eventually and that it was neccessary for Vietnam to gain independence first and industrialize before communism could really happen there.  So Ho's nationalisn was clearly linked to his communism.  Almost like a Yin and Yang....they were a apart of each other.<br />Duiker shows that it was not as simple as some make it for the US to back Ho Chi Minh over the French at the end of WWII.  However, it is clear that whatever the risk of backing Ho Chi Minh it would have been a better option then the one we took.  55,000 brave American's died in Vietnam.  How might history have been different if we backed an indepenedent Vietnam over re-establishment of French colonialism.<br />Duiker points out how the Europeanists in the state dept. one over the Asia specialists who backed dealing with Ho Chi Minh.  Again, hindsight is 20/20 but its food for thought.  because in the end 55,000 Americans died, Vietnam became entirely communists as well as Laos and Cambodia at that time.<br />This summer, i have the opportunity to visit Vietnam as a teacher and as someone born after the war.  I feel this book gave me some excellent background for my trip and lots of food for thought.<br />So, if you have a lot of time and want to read a good book about an interesting figure in history I highly recommend Ho Chi Minh by William Duiker.  It was worth the money and the time spent reading it.	2001-02-21

I guess it has been about 6 years since I read James Lee Burke for the first time.  Dixie City Jam was one of the best books I had ever read.  That summer I went back and read all the other books of the series.  They were all unbelievable, with In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead and Stained White Radiance as being the two I felt stood out the most.  In fact, I think in the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead is one of the most complex, creative, and exciting books ever.  How can a series get better after works like Dixie City Jam and the Electric Mist.<br />Burning Angel was a disappointment to me.  It was actually the only book in the series I was not crazy about.  Fortunately I felt Caddy Jukebox made up for lost ground.  Sunset Limited was good, but was an inside job.  Sunset Limited I felt was the only one in the series that only people who had read past books would get.<br />So which direction would the series go?  Well Purple Cane Road answered that question and some.  It was beyond awesome.  I am not going to sit here and repeat plot details, only know this...James Lee Burke outdid himself and had produced a masterpiece.  The book is a great mystery as usual, has great writing as usual, great charaters, great dialogue, but added to all that is an emotional intensity that we have not seen in the series before.<br />Also, its great to see how everyone's character is aging.  All I can say is if you are a fan of the series do not wait on this one.<br />And if you have not read any of the books before...hold off on this one and either read them in order or start with Dixie City Jam.<br />What a great book and a great series!	2001-02-09

I first travelled to China in 1998 and brought with me the then current edition of the Lonely Planet.  My review of it is here somewhere.  Despite being on a guided and highly structured tour, I found the guide absolutely indespensible and I used it constantly before and during my trip.<br />China has changed so much in just two years.  The change is even more evident in the major touristy type cities such as Beijing, Xian, and Shanghai.  Fortunately, as China changes so does the Lonely Planet guide.  And fortunately, the guide is just as good as ever.<br />I enjoyed the LP China book for two reasons. First off, the background information is so awesome for preperation for a trip to China.  China is a great trip, but at times it is not an easy trip.  However, the guide does a good job of letting you know ahead of time what wonders, amazments, and frustrations may lie ahead.<br />Once in China the book is awesome on where to go, the background and history of where you are, and how to get there.  The maps and train times are oh so important.<br />China is a great and challenging trip.  To do it right you need to be ready for it before and while there.  Simply put, the LP book is the best way to get ready for a big trip to China.<br />This book never left my side during two trips to China.  This book is worth every penny it costs.	2001-01-07

However, feel the book falters on covering the demise of the Gang of Four and the early rule of Deng.  As great as the book was up to this point, I feel he does not thoroughly cover how the gang of four was defeated and the early rule of Deng.<br />The book recovers in its coverage of Tianaman Square and in its conclusions about China.<br />This book is 3/4 brilliant and 1/4 ok.	2001-01-03

Over Christmas break I made a return trip to China and brought with me a copy of Mark Salzman's Laughing Sutra.<br />Salzman's Iron and Silk, though a bit dated, is one of the best books on visiting China.  It is a wonderful read, a great teaching tool, and just simply a great book.<br />I had tried reading the Laughing Sutra a number of times and never got past the first chapter.  However, during a 5 hour train ride between Beijing and Chengde China I gave the book another shot.<br />The first chapter is tough, but once you get past it this book is wonderful. It is funny, intelligent, clever, and a great history of China.<br />Salzman in brilliant fashion tells the story of Journey to the West, the Monkey King, Three Kingdoms, and the cultural revolution.  This book is so creative and so brilliant.<br />Once past the first chapter I read the book in two days.  It was an awesome literary experience.<br />My one warning is that you have to know a decent amount about China and Chinese history and literature to get the full effect of this book.  Anyone who enjoys reading about China will eat this book up.<br />I cannot say enough goods things about this book.<br />READ IT!	2001-01-03

The author clearly respects Japanese history and has mastered it, while not making excuses for their mistakes.  To often Japanese and Chinese scholars have been seduced by the cultures of these areas and it clouds their writing and interpretations.  I liked the neutrality of this book.<br />I am less interested in social history, so I will not lie and pretend to have found those chapters interesting, it is not my thing.<br />The chapters that I felt were the best dealth with the unification of Japan around 1600 and the events surrounding the Meiji Restoration of 1868.<br />To me, one of the most interesting periods in Japanese history is the 16th and 17th century.  The stories and actions of Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu (my screen name)fascinate me greatly.  However, there is so little in English about them.  It is so hard to find many sources on these great Japanese leaders and the final battles at Sekigara and Osaka castle.  So it was quite enjoyable to read about them in this book.  The Tokugawa Shogunate ruled Japan for over 200 years and was great to read how it came into power and stayed in power.  If this time period interests you, you must read Totman's bio of Tokugawa and of course Cavells Shogun.<br />Equally as interesting is how the Tokugawa Shogunate collapsed and the Emperor was restored.  The book does a great job detailing Perry's arrival in Japan and its forced opening to the west.  The book also does a great job discussing the infighting in Japan going on at the time of Perry's arrival and after.  The book makes it clear that the Meiji Restoration was more than simply a reaction to Western Imperialism.  I enjoyed reading about all the infighting between the remaining Tokugawabakfu and the more rebellous daimyo.<br />Also the author does a great job describing how after the Meiji restoration Japan modernized and westernized.<br />I also feel this books makes up for some of the weaknesses in other recent books on modern Japan.  &quot;Embracing Defeat&quot; was too sympathetic to the Japanese in dealing with its history immediately after WWII.  This book stays neutral.<br />Also,Bix recent biography of Hirohito, really did not go into enough detail of the Meiji restoration which this books does a great job of.<br />However, that creates another problem.  Again, if you have read either Bix' Hirohito or Embracing Defeat you will be pretty well informed of post-WWII Japan.  Therefore the last chapters of this book are really not neccessary to read.  Again, its done well, but having read both of those books makes his information a bit of overkill.<br />So, if you are looking for a good overview of recent Japanese history you will enjoy this book.  It is well written and informative and at times surprizingly entertaining.  But again, the last few parts of this book cover material fans of Japanese history will have read too much of recently.<br />If you like Japanese history, you will like this book.	2000-12-09

I know few writers who can write as beautifully as he does.  Though it is dated, Video Night in Katmandu, is a right on the mark look at travelling throughout Asia.  And his Lady and the Monk is simply one of the best books you will ever read.  Lady and the Monk is as close to Japan as you can get without actually being there.<br />It was with the in mind, that made me purchase his latest book immediately upon release.  However, I never read The Global Soul after reading bad reviews in the Times and on Amazon here.  Instead I read the biographies of Ataturk and Hirohito.  I picked this book up again to kill the time before reading the new biography of Ho Chi Minh.<br />Like Iyers other works, this book is great.  Many of the critics of this book point to the disjointness of the story, which is true but this is done on purpose.  The book is as confused to create a jet lag type state which is a fundamental part of the book.<br />Iyer is not for everyone.  Iyer is the type of writer that Asia travellers will get the most out of.  That is the bottom line.  The appreciate this book one must do a lot of travelling to Asia and at the same time know a lot of people who travel.  If this is not you, I do not think you will like the book.<br />But again, if you enjoy travel narratives with a heavily slant towards East Asia, read this book.<br />Iyer is a great writer and I enjoyed this book a lot.	2000-11-19

As a history teacher it is not easy to read a book of this size and length during the school year, if only this had come out during the summer.  Hopefully it will take me less time to finish the new book on Ho Chi Minh.<br />First off, kudos to the author for making the book highly readable.  Also, the book does a remarkable job with the primary source.  The author could not have had an easy time gaining access to and translating the number of Japanese primary sources he makes use of.  I was surprised by the number of Japanese sources he uses and a bit shocked at the lack of english secondary sources.<br />The book makes it loud and clear that Hirohito was not a passive monarch during WWII.  The book makes it clear that while the military did many things in China on there own before WWII that Hirohito did nothing to stop it.  The book makes it clear that Hirohito is was an active participant in the Japanese war machine between 1937-1945.<br />The author makes a strong case for this, backs it up, and presents it to the reader in an easy and interesting narrative.<br />I had a major problem with the way the book portrayed Harry S. Truman.  I did not like the fact, that even though the author blames Hirohito for delaying the Japanese surrender setting the stage for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that he still has something negative to say about Truman.  I believe after blaming Hirohito, the author felt it neccessary to add that Truman lacked &quot;the patience and foresight&quot; to hold off on the atomic bombings.  I suggest anyone who wants a better look at the atomic bombings and Truman to look at Ferrell's &quot;Truman and the Bomb.&quot;<br />I also felt the book lacked the emotional punch that was in Iris Chang's the Rape of Nanking.  Bix, goes into detail about Hirohito's knowledge of the atrocities that were committed by the Japanese to the Chinese, but he does not do as good a job as Chang does in her book.<br />Also, the ending chapters in the book which cover the occupation of Japan and rebuilding of Japan after WWII pale in comparrison to &quot;Embracing Defeat.&quot;  While, Bix is more realistic and less an sympathetic toward the Japanese as the author of &quot;Embracing Defeat&quot; he did not do as good a job with the material.  Any fan of Japanese history that has read &quot;Embracing Defeat&quot; will really not need to read the last 50 or so pages of the book.<br />But I am being picky.  This was a much needed book.  Too often in the circle of Japanese history writers there is a tendancy to allow admiration for Japanese culture and the Japanese people to cloud judgement.  Too often the crimes committed by the Japanese during WWII are overlooked and forgotten about.  Bix has written an excellent biography of Hirohito.  It is a biography that is not afraid to be critical of the Japanese, which so many writers seem to be.  Bix makes it clear what Hirohito's role in WWII was.  Yes, I do not think he made the correct assessment on Truman, and yes I do not think his chapters on the occupation are as good as some others, but do not let these little things stop you from reading this book.  If you like Japanese and WWII history you will enjoy this book.<br />This book is money and time well spent.<br />In addition, anyone who liked this book should check out the historical novel &quot;The Emperor's General&quot; by James Webb.  It is a historical novel of the relationship between MacArthur and Hirohito.  It is a great novel...I highly recommend it!	2000-11-14

It is a court room mystery set in  a WWII POW camp in Germany.<br />I enjoyed the story and the characters very  much.  The mystery itself was OK and the resolution of it is OK, not great,  not overally memoriable but for genre the book itself is pretty good.  The  racial aspect of the book is again interesting but again not as good as it  could be.  The idea was there and some of the execution was there, but its  not to the level of a To Kill a Mockingbird or even A Time To Kill.<br />I  will not claim to be any sort of WWII POW camp expert.  But one of the  problems I had with the book was the whole &quot;good german&quot; guard  and warden of the camp.  To me it gave the book, despite its seriousness,  an element of Hogan's heroes.  I know that all Germans were not Nazis but  two of the main German characters in this book were a little to nice.  Also  the idea of the camp Gestapo officer testifying and answering questions at  a tribunal run by POWs was almost laughable.<br />But maybe I am making too  much of what this book is.  The book is a good paperback mystery novel.  In  fact it is above average.  But the history teacher in me wanted a little  more.  Like The War of the Rats which I read before this, I felt this was a  good book but not up to the potential book it could have been.  Both are  good WWII paperbacks for a nice day at the park of the beach but in the end  they are forgetable books that will eventually be passed on to a friend or  donated to the library.	2000-09-04

A friend of mine who is also a social studies teacher like myself high recommended this book.  As a fan of historical fiction, a teacher always  looking for &quot;readable literature&quot; for the kids, and a student of  WWII I highly look forward to reading this book.<br />The book is very  readable and will only take a couple of days.  The author does a good job  describing the total battlefield of Stalingrad while at the same time  providing well rounded and interesting characters.  As another reviewer  stated, the author also does a good job keeping the story human and avoids  making the book a technothriller.<br />Bottom line is the book is good but not  great.  The sniper duel itself is not overly exciting.  Its good reading  but its not very thrilling at all.  Also, I find it very hard to sympathize  with any of the German army characters in the book. And this is not limited  to Thovald the German supersniper.  Yes, the eastern front was horrible.   And Yes, not every German soldier was a Nazi.  But I still have a tough  time reading fiction or non-fiction that gives a German perspective on WWII  and feeling bad for them.  I felt the same way after watching the German  film &quot;Stalingrad&quot; which also looked at the battle.  Das Boot is  probably the only WWII story that made me feel bad for German military  personel during the war.<br />I am amazed that War of the Rats was based on  true events and find the story itself intriguing.  But I guess I was hoping  for something like a WWII Alls Quiet on the Western Front.  The book does  not do that.  This book while entertaining does not leave the reader with  much emotional impact.  I left Saving Private Ryan emotionally impacted.   The recent TNT film of Nuremberg left a deep impression on me.  At the end  of War of the Rats, I felt like I had killed some good time at the  beach.<br />War of the Rats is a book you will enjoy reading but its not one  that you will remember.	2000-08-30

Tom Clancy and his  novels are some of my favorite to read.  So Debt of Honor should have been  the perfect book.  Unfortunately it was not.<br />Bottom line was the story  was one of Clancy's most ridiculous.  And way too much on the finacial  stuff.  Pages and pages of the Wall Street and economic stuff was just too  much.<br />The ending is certainly a shock, but again too far fetched. Too  much on stocks and currency and not enough action.  The whole idea of a  Japan rising is old too and just a bit cheesy...maybe in 1985 it would have  been more topical.<br />I love Tom Clancy books.  And this is the only one I  did not like.  Parts of this book are very boring and others are laughable.   The ending sets a great new storyline while at the same time....COME  ON!<br />There are better novels about Japan and certainly better Clancy  novels.	2000-08-24

It contains a lot of information, its very dull at times, and it does not  go into great depth all the time.<br />The bottom line is that is exactly what  this book is.  Its a short basic history of China.  This is more of a  reference book than a specific look at a very specific event.<br />No, China  experts will not be in love with this book.  But anyone looking for a  survey of Chinese History or looking for a decent desk/bookcase reference  book on China will find this book useful.	2000-08-22

Christopher Hibbert is a great historian and writer.  His histories and  biographies read like novels and are often just as interesting.  His take  on the American Revolution is no exception.<br />However, Hibbert takes an  interesting perspective.  He writes of the American Revolution through the  eyes of the British.  This is a perspective we usually do not get in the  United States.<br />Interestingly enough, even though Hibbert told the story  through British eyes, at no time in the narrative did I feel bad for the  British.  Even though its the British story, I still was rooting for the  US!<br />Hibbert is a great writer and it does not matter which perspective he  used in this book because the bottom line is that it is a very readable and  informative book on the American Revolution.<br />I highly recommend this book  and any others written by Hibbert.	2000-08-22

Set in a time period a little after  the time period described in the classic book Shogun, these books are  pretty good.  They do a decent job with the setting, characters, and the  story.<br />The Concubine's Tattoo is up to par with the rest of the series.   Once again our hero Sano protects the Shogun and solves the mystery.  There  is some good period and historical detail and at the same time there is  some cheese.<br />If you are interested in Japan and Japanese history you will  like this book and the others in the series.  For mystery fans the books  are ok also.  Again, I think this book or any in the series are no Shogun  but if you like Japan and Samurai type stuff this is pretty good.  For a  more modern mystery series set in Japan check the Salaryman's Wife and Zen  Attitude.<br />This is not a classic book.  But if you are looking for a good  period historical mystery to read on the beach, plane or on the train this  book fits the bill.	2000-08-22

After a Year of teaching Global History I had no idea  who Kemal Ataturk was.  The only time I saw his name was on the New York  State Regents Final Exams in Global History.  When I saw his name the first  time, I did not think much of it.  It was when I saw his name on the test  several years in a row that I decided to pay attention.<br />For those of us  who teach Global History in NY, Kemal Ataturk is one of those people we  need to learn about and teach to the kids.  In was under that pretext that  I learned more about Ataturk and his importance in world history and not  just in my classroon.<br />Therefore I was very excited to find this spring  that a new English language biography of his life was written using many  Turkish sources.<br />The book itself is very needed.  It was something I knew  I had to read to improve my understanding of Ataturks life and his  importance.<br />Overall the book is good.  The book is best in describing the  state of the crumbling Ottoman Empire before WWI.  The book also does a  great job showing how the Young Turks came to power and the collapse of the  Ottoman Empire and the rise of Kemal and the Turkish republic after WWI.  I  enjoyed reading about the intrigue, the rival leaders, the disasterous  Balkan War, WWI, and the Greek Wars.<br />The book also does a great job  showing how Ataturk finally overthrew the Ottoman Empire while at the same  time dealing with the Greeks, and the victorious Allies after WWI.  The  book also clearly shows Ataturk's love of Drink and how it shortened his  life.<br />Unfortunately this is not an easy read.  This books takes a long  time to get through.  Too much of the book is also a laundry list.  To  often the author gives too much detail.  To many day by day descriptions of  events.  These faults make the book tough to read.  However, the ultimate  understanding one gains of Ataturk and Turkish history is worth the  effort.<br />I also feel the author failed to address the Armenian genocide.   The Ottoman Empire committed horrible acts upon the Armenians and this book  failed to address this and any role or thoughts Ataturk had on this  subject.  I do not know if Ataturk had anything to do with the Armenians  and I would have liked to find out.<br />Kemal Ataturk is the father of modern  Turkey.  He overthrew the Ottoman Empire, secured a sovereign Turkey,  modernized Turkey, westernized Turkey, and is a major figure in World  History.<br />This book is not the most exciting biography in the world but it  tells the story of an important man who needs to be studied.	2000-08-22

Hibbert writes about some  tough topics in history and makes them very interesting.  Hibber is one of  those few historians that write so well you think you are there.  His books  on the French Revolution and the English Civil War are two prime examples  of that ability.  His book on the Renaissance through the story of the  Medici family is another great example of his writing.<br />The Medici family  was a patron family in Italy during the Renaissance.  Basically they paid  for some of the art created in Italy during the Renaissance.<br />In telling  the story of the Medici family, Hibbert is really telling the story of  Italy and Renaissance Italy.  Hibberts gift is biography and his writings  make the individual historical figures become very human and alive.<br />I  found the most interesting section of the book the story of the Priest  Savonarola.  Hibbert does a great job discussing his role in Italy and the  controversies he created.<br />In short, anyone interested in Renaissance  history, Italian history, or good readable history will enjoy this work and  others by Christopher Hibbert.	2000-08-18

I have been fortunate enough to visit Japan 2x and encourage anyone with the time and the means to visit Japan.<br />Shogun  by James Clavell is one of the best books I have ever read.  Shogun and  Lonesome Dove are probably the only two books I have read that I was upset  when they ended.  They are great works and Shogun is great history and  story.<br />The Sano detective stories take place a little after Shogun.  They  take place during the Tokugawa Shogunate but during the rule of Ieyasu's  (Torenaga in Shogun's)third successor around 1700 I think.<br />The settings  of these novels are good and the mysteries are ok.   The problem I had with  the series starting with Bundori was how graphic the sexual parts of the  story have become.  Very often I think it takes from characters and the  setting.<br />These novels are fun.  Great reading for the plane or the beach.   These are not deep looks into Tokugawa Japan, however they are good  historical mysteries with good settings.<br />Read Shogun and then work on  these.	2000-08-17

The Japanese committed many horrible crimes and atrocities on the Chinese  population.  Red Sorghum in very graphic graphic detail describes some of  these atrocities and their impact on the Chinese civilian population.<br />But  the book is much more than that.  WWII does play a major role in the book,  but the book is also a look into Chinese culture, family, and is such a  moving window on China during this time period.<br />This is not an easy read.   The translation is very good, but the book is very detailed and again at  times very graphic.  I do not like to bash books like the Good Earth or The  Single Pebble as many people do.  I agree that neither book was written by  a Chinese person and I understand some of the criticism that orginates from  that fact.  I enjoyed both books and think they are valuable.  HOwever, if  you are from the school that demands a Chinese author and a Chinese voice  to Chinese literature you must read Mo Yan.  He is a gifted writer and he  brings to life some very difficult times in Chinese History.<br />This is a  very powerful book and parts of it will stay with you long after you have  read the book.  Again, this is not an easy book to read but well worth the  effort.	2000-08-17

The Cartoon Chinese Philosophy books of this series interest me for two  reasons: I like Chinese History and I have to teach it to high school  kids.<br />On a personal level I enjoy reading through these books and find it  much more useful than some of the straight translations even though they  may be more complete and more pleasing to academics.  In addition to the  Confucius book, I have enjoyed both Daoist books and the version of the Art  of War.<br />As a teacher, I like this book even better.  New York State  requires high school kids to have 2 years of world history.  In this new  political correct world, world history is no longer dominated by Europe.   In fact, must of the New York State exam is about Asia and Africa.  Thus  Confucianism is a very important concept to teach.<br />Filial Piety, the  concept of order and relationships, and the 5 Confucianian relationships  are extremely important.  But they are not fun things to the average  teenager.  There are many lessons we can get from Confucius as adults, for  kids its a bit harder.  However, these comic books make teaching Confucius  so much easier and effective.  The kids like to read them and they get so  much more from them.<br />So in short, yes this is not the complete Confucius.   But for anyone who wants to read a visually pleasing edition or teaches  this is quite good.	2000-08-11

Great dialogue, characters you care  about, great descriptions of New Orleans, and intelligent story lines are  just some of what sets these novels apart.<br />I feel as a fan of the series,  Sunset Limited continues that trend.<br />What I found a little different  about this particular novel was the lack of background information on some  of the series secondary characters.  I have found that any of the other  novels in the series give enough information that someone new could start  with any of them.  However, this is not the case with Sunset Limited.   Therefore, I do not recommend this particular David Robicheaux novel for  newcomers.  I was surprized at just how little his wife, Batist, his  daughter had to do with this story.  But again, other than that this was a  great book.	2000-08-11

I started at Dixie City Jam and worked my way back.  So I agree that in  the scheme of things Neon Rain is not the best in the series, but it is a  great start to a great thing.<br />To read about David as a cop in New Orleand  working with Clete.

Its not the best I have read, but I certainly enjoyed reading  it.<br />Robert Johnson is considered one of the greatest blues musicians  ever.  Just look at his influence on blues and rock.  Led Zepplin, Eric  Clapton are all heavly influenced by Johnson.  The legend is that Johnson  made a deal with the devil for his talent.  And many blame his early death  on the devil.  I liked how the book dealt with the legend of RJ's death as  well as what might have really happened.  <br />Personally, what I think holds  this book back is the lack of character development.  Perhaps that will  come.  I enjoyed the whole Robert Johnson aspect of the book but after this  first book I still do not know enough about Nick Travers the main character  and I actually cared less about him than I did some of the other  characters.  Hopefully as the series grows we will learn more about Nick  and care for him more.<br />Putting a mystery series in the New Orleans area  presents another problem.  James Lee Burke's awesome series of books  featuring Dave Robicheaux has a similiar setting.  Atkins should take a  lesson from Burke.  Burke is in my opinion one of the best novelists out  there and his books are hands down the best mystery books out there.  Plus  Dave Robicheaux is a very very complex character.<br />So again, blues fans  will enjoy this book.  But for this series to work Atkins needs a little  more work.  I look forward to reading the next one and seeing if he is up  to the challenge.	2000-08-05

Let me start off my saying that I respect Jesse Ventura very much.  I  loved him as a wrestler.  I loved him even more as a play by play announcer  for wrestling and more and more I respect him as a politician.<br />This book  is ok.  It reads very fast.  I read the whole thing in two days sitting by  the pool while on vacation in Florida.  Its an easy and interesting  read.<br />Somethings did surprize me about the book.  I thought that the real  good stuff in the book would be about his wrestling and military career.   That was not the case.  Those chapters in my opinion were not that  good.<br />What was great about this book was the story about his election as  both mayor in a small town and as Governor of Minn.  Those were very  exciting chapters and I really felt proud for Jesse reading those chapters.   This book does prove that anyone should and can run for office.<br />The more  I see Jesse as a politician on TV, talking about the conventions and the  two party system the more respect I gain for him.  Seriously, the more I  hear him talk, the more I believe what he says.  He really makes sense.   Alot of this comes out in the book.  The book is great for the political  aspects of Jesse's life.  Unfortunately, the book does not do the same for  his pre-political life.<br />It also made me very happy to read that Jesse was  very pro-Union.  Also, as a teacher I respect and agree 100% that a major  solution for any and most educational problems in this country across the  board is a reduction in class size.  The fact that Jesse talks about this  so much too me shows that he understands what really  goes on in schools  today.<br />So again, an easy book to read.  Interesting in the political  stuff, but a bit lacking in the SEAL, WWF, and movie career of &quot;The  Body/The Mind.&quot;	2000-08-05
US	52479865	R1PFBP22HOLGHJ	0446607851	784906101	Citizen Washington	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A Great Book!	In my opinion this has been a mixed year for historical fiction.  I was extremely disappointed with The Tides of War a book I looked very forward too.  I had mixed feeling about James Brady's look at the Korean War.   However, I was lucky enough to read the historical gems The Peking Letter  and the Emperors General.  The Peking Letter was a fictional look at the  Chinese Civil War and the Emperors General was a fantastic look at  MacArthur and the occupation of Japan after WWII.<br />William Martin's  Citizen Washington is a great example of a awesome work of historical  fiction.  I picked this book up after being inspired by the movie the  Patriot to learn more about the Revolutionary War Period.  And this book  was a great find.<br />The author tells the story of George Washington through  the eyes of several fictional and real figures.  However the author is  really telling the story of the colonial period, slavery, the French and  Indian War, the Revolutionary War, and the growth of  American Political  Parties.<br />The author did a great job and this book, even though ultimately  fiction really draws the reader into the time period.<br />Ultimately the most  accurate histories are going to be non-fiction secondary sources and the  actual primary sources.  However, anyone reading this book will really  learn alot about George Washington and his times.<br />I also enjoyed the end  parts of the book where Jefferson and Hamilton tell much of the story and  in doing so illustrate the differences between the Democractic-Republicans  and the Federalists.<br />However, the biggest and most important part of this  book is what a great man George Washington was.  From this book you see  what this man really did for our country as both a military leader and  President.  George Washington was not a saint, the book deals with his  flaws, but he is a genuine 100% hero worthy of all the praise our history  shows him.<br />If you want to learn about Washington and the Revolution READ  THIS BOOK.  If you just want to read a good book GET THIS BOOK.  This book  is time well spent.  I look forward to reading more of the authors  works.<br />Also, I recommend educators who teach American history on either  the high school or college level use this book.  Students can learn alot  from it while not being bored.	2000-07-28

First and foremost Colin Powell has led a very interesting and important life and that makes for a great story.  And second, the Ghost author of the book, who I assume does  most of the writting did a great job.  This is a memoir that reads better  than a lot of fiction.<br />While reading this book, I was teaching high  school in the South Bronx so it was extra inspiring to read about Powells  growing up in a neighborhood around the corner from where I worked.  I  enjoyed very much his early life in the Bronx and his experiences at CUNY  uptown, the same school my father attended.<br />But the book is so much more  than Powells life and actions.  The book, like the memoir of Stormin  Norman, does a great job of describing the Vietnam War.  I enjoyed learning  about the heroism of our soldiers in Vietnam while at the same time I was  frustrated to read about how the war was fought.<br />I gained a new  appreciation of what Powell and Schwartzkopf accomplished in the Gulf once  I had read about there experiences in Vietnam.  Powell's Vietnam  experiences certainly explain his Gulf actions and goals.<br />The book also  did a good job showing what goes on both on the battlefield and in the  Pentagon and Whitehouse.  <br />Powells story is very inspiring.  This was a  great book and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read about an  interesting life, military history, politics, leadership, character and on  and on.  This is an excellent book.	2000-07-27
US	52479865	R2I8S9BJ7YSTBC	0679763872	848188784	The China Reader: The Reform Era	Books	4	11	13	N	N	A Great Resource on China	In 1998 I had the wonderful opportunity to visit the People's Republic of China for One Month with the American Forum for Global Education.  I participated on this trip as a representative of a New York City High  School in the Bronx.<br />As part of the preperation for this trip of a  lifetime we did a series of intensive workshops on Chinese history,  culture, politics, society etc.  During one of these workshops we were told  the following which I feel describes this wondeful collection of primary  and secondary sources on modern China.  We were told that if you visit  China for a week you can write a book on China.  If you visit China for a  month you can write a magazine article on China.  And if you visit China  for a year you could barely write an article.  In short, the less of China  you see the more you think you know and the more of China you see the less  you think you know.<br />And I know from from more than just reading how true  this is.  But this collection illustrates this fact very well.  This is a  great collection of primary sources from Chinese and world leaders as well  as some great secondary source articles by many of the China experts.<br />I  especially enjoyed reading the contributions of editor Orville Schell.  I  think of all the China experts he is most on the money and I found his  comments the most interesting.  I encourage anyone interested in China to  look at his book Mandate of Heaven.<br />China is a complex issue.  The legacy  of Mao, their attempts at capitalism without democracy, relations with  Taiwan, the occupation of Tibet, and of course trade and human rights.   Again, I feel the more we know about China the less we know.  <br />But  regardless of your stance on any of these issues: trade, Taiwan, Human  Rights, Tibet anyone looking at this collection should walk away  understanding why we need to have as much contact with China as possible.   We have many issues with China and many disagreements but a nation of 1.2  billion people can not be ignored or punished by isolation.<br />This is a  great book but as with anything involving China more information often  means more questions and less answers.<br />I also highly recommend the recent  &quot;A Great Wall: Six Presidents and China&quot;, Mark Salzman's classic  &quot;Iron and Silk&quot;, Simon Winchester's &quot;River at the Center of  the World&quot;, and the recent novel &quot;The Peking Letter&quot; to  anyone interested in China.	2000-07-27

Theodore Roosevelt is by far one of our best and mostinteresting Presidents.  Theodore Roosevelt affected so many things inAmerican society.  Roosevelt affected social issues, the environment, the military, business, and foreign policy.<br />Roosevelt was the first American President since Lincoln to be a powerful President and Roosevelt used that power to change American for the better.<br />Miller's biography of Roosevelt starts out very good. Miller does a great job describing Teddy's early life.  The book is very good in describing the home Teddy grew up in.  It does a good job on his early health problems and how he overcame them.  The book is also great on TR's personal and family life.  Miller does a great job telling TR's story up until his Presidency.<br />I feel the book fails and fails badly in telling the story of Teddy the President.  I felt this book which had been so readable and so informative really crashes where it should be most interesting: TR the President.<br />So if you want a good biography of Teddy's early life check out the first parts of this book.  However, for a good look at TR's Presidency and its impact you must search elsewhere.<br />Nothing is worse than a book which is good for a decent number of pages and then falls apart.	2000-07-27

Religions has been a major topic on most of the statewide Global History and Studies tests for the last few years.  And of course,  when talking about Global religions it is very important to discuss  Buddhism and its founder Siddartha.<br />Having taught Buddhism for over 5  years now, I finally got the chance to read Hesse's novel Siddartha.  I  found it on a display of recommended high school reading.<br />I must say I  enjoyed sitting in a local park, looking at a nearby pond and reading this  book.  I especially enjoyed the parts when Siddartha gave up his material  items.  I found the passages when he realized life was suffering and that  he must rid himself of desires, wants, and material possessions.<br />However,  one aspect of the novel confused me enough to leave me with mixed feelings  about it.  Call me stupid, but what messed me up was that there was a  character in the book known as the Buddha, Gautama, and yet Siddartha was  another character.  Siddartha was the founder of Buddhism and his title was  Buddha, and yet they were two different people in the book.  Or were they?  Was Siddartha and the Buddha in the book really the same person but Hesse  just did not come out with it directly?  Or is Hesse contrasting his  character, a fictional Siddartha, with the real Buddha?  I am not  sure.<br />Also, as a teacher I would not assign this entire book to a 9th or  10th grader which are the grades who study Buddhism.  Personally, I do not  think this is the type a book most high school students would enjoy or  fully understand.  I had trouble with it and I am the teacher.  However,  there were certain parts and passages of the book that I certainly would  discuss in class.  So I recommend certain parts of this book to be used in  school and not assigning the whole book to kids.<br />I am glad I read this  book and look forward to reading it again and understanding even more of  it.  This strikes me as the type of book you learn something new from each  time you look at it.n more of  it.  This strikes me as the type of book you learn something new from each  time you look at it.	2000-07-23

As a social studies teacher and a student of history one can not deny the importance of Thoreau's views on civil disobedience.  The impact of his teachings on the world are amazing.  Thoreau's views on civil disobedience  and their affect on Martin Luther King and Ghandi helped make this world a  better place.  So again, I understand why Thoreau is important.<br />Now onto  Walden Pond.  Do people actually read this and enjoy it?  I was required to  read this for a masters course in early American Intellectual Thought and  man I will never read this again.<br />Pages and pages of boring unimportant  information about his daily life....zzzzz.  How does anyone enjoy reading  about how he built his hut or what clothes he wears.  Can he bore us some  more with his agricultural failures?  This book was torture.  Yes Thoreau  is important, but so is my time and reading this book was a complete  waste.<br />If you have trouble sleeping, pick up this book	2000-07-23

Confucius and Confucianism, Lao-tzu and Daoism, and Sun Tzu and the Art of War are just some of the Great Eastern Thinking we should look at and apply  to our everyday lives.<br />The Art of War is more than a book on warfare.  It  is a book about battle yes, politics yes, but it can be applied to  business, relationships, leadership, and other day to day life activities.   It is a book that should be looked at.<br />This particular version and the  other books in this illustrated series is awesome.  It is so much fun to  look at and read and yet we can learn so much from this work.<br />I agree,  this is not the best complete translation.  Personally, I enjoy the James  Clavell translation.

It is fun to read and at times an  interesting behinds the scenes look at the world of wrestling.<br />The book  is very good when the rock is telling his story and the story of his  family.  His wrestling grandfather and father, growing up, his days as a  football player, and the road to becoming a wrestler are great.  These are  the best parts of the book.<br />However, too much of the book is simply a  recap of his matches and performances at various pay-per-view events.  When  the book boggs down in the retelling, in character, of how the matches went  the book is stupid.<br />But when the Rock discusses the behind the scenes  action.  Then the book is very good.  Had the Rock gone into more detail  about Wrestling, the business, and gave less recaps of King of the Ring  matches, the book would have been great instead of just good.<br />Again, its  a fun book.  It is good autobiography at times as well as an interesting  behind the scenes look at wrestling.  However, what holds the book back are  excessive amounts of match recaps.	2000-07-19

Walter  Lord is one of those Historian writers who can recreate an event so well  its like you are there.  He has done it for the Titanic, Pearl Harbor,  Dunkirk, Midway, and the Alamo.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out this  is an older book.  Yes many books have been written on the Alamo since.   But none are as good.  Lord recreates what happened and even though we all  know the results, the book is still exciting.

The Professor and the Madman is a pretty good book.  Simon Winchester is  an excellent writer and the book for the most part tells an interesting  story.<br />The relationship between the editor of the Oxford English  Dictionary and the convicted insane murderer who submitted so many of its  definitions is very interesting.<br />Winchester does a great job telling the  story of their lives and how their paths cross.  Winchester is also very  clever with using definitions from the OED at the start of each chapter  that fit the chapters subject.  I thought that was neat.<br />This is not a  long book and reads very quickly.  However the parts I did not like were  when Winchester went off on a tangent on the history of certain words and  dictionaries.  That I found a bit much.<br />So other than the parts on word  origins and the history of dictionaries this was a good book.<br />I also  highly recommend Winchesters early book on travelling the Yangtze River in  China.

I would also like to say, right off the bat that what these brave  Marines went through and what our brave veterans in Korea did should never  be forgotten.  It is a shame that the Korean War is the so called  &quot;Forgotten War.&quot;<br />But let me say something that is pathetic but  true.  I am a history teacher, and let me unfortunately tell you many of my  students barely know the Civil War, WWI, WWII, or any other war let alone  the Korean War.  The lack of knowledge of our history in this country is  pathetic.<br />Now to the book.  Its a good book.  Well written and easy to  read.  It provides a good background of what happened in both the big and  little picture.<br />However, I felt the book was not great.  In fact, I have  found the Oral history of the Chosin by Wilson was a more exciting read.   Not to take anything away from Brady's book, it was a good read but again  not great.<br />I hope this book is a big best seller.  I hope many people  that were unaware of what happened during the Korean War and the Chosin  Resevoir learn from this book and want to find out more.<br />But again, the  book is not a classic.  Its a good read, but believe it or not some of the  non-fiction about the Korean War is better reading.	2000-06-27

Books	4	63	86	N	N	A Very Well Written Imperialist View of the Boxer Rebellion!	Let me say from the beginning that I enjoyed reading this book very much.  The author wrote an exciting, informative, and easy to read read book on the Boxer Rebellion in China.  I do not wish to take that away from the  author or to underscore how much I enjoyed reading this book.<br />Now to my  major problem with this book.  Let me make a similar comparrison.  I  recently read &quot;Embracing Defeat&quot; which looked at Japan right at  the end of WWII.  There was a chapter on all the poor Japanese soldiers in  Korea and China who were so far away from home. The author conviently left  out why those Japanese soldiers were there and what horrible crimes they  committed.<br />In this history of the Boxer Rebellion, the author makes a  similiar mistake.  Simply, this book might as well be Rudyard Kiplings  history of the Boxer Rebellion.  I am not saying that the Boxers didnt do  some horrible things, but the bottom line is foreigners whether imperialist  or missionaries..they simply did not belong in China.  And the onese that  were there were not doing the right thing.<br />The Boxer Rebellion was  China's attempt to kick out the imperialists.  Can u blame them?  Opium?  Spheres of Influence?  Unfair Treaties?  Christianity?  White Man's Burden?   The Europeans did not belong in China.  The Chinese were justified in  trying to kick them out.<br />The author sets up a picture of the poor  Europeans and the uncivilized and barbaric Chinese.  Again, I enjoyed  reading the book but this book might as well have been written in  1905.<br />Imperialists messed up China.  Plain and simple.  Not to defend the  last Empress Ci Xi or the Qing Dynasty or the means used by the Boxers but  heck can u blame them?<br />So to summarize, I enjoyed reading this book.  It  made great use of primary sources and told a good story.  However, this  kind of history is unfair.  The Boxer Rebellion was more than the  &quot;good Europeans&quot; vs. the &quot;bad&quot; Chinese.<br />RudyardKipling would be proud.	2000-06-22

This theory has been disproven so many times already.<br />Atomic Diplomacy is the mistaken belief that the United States did not need to use the atomic bombs  on Japan at the end of WWII.  Atomic Diplomacy is the belief the bombs were  used to scare the Soviets and not to end the war.<br />This theory is garbage  because it ignores the evidence.  The evidence is overwhelming that Truman  used the bomb to end the war and prevent further casaulties.  Truman's  memoirs, Truman biographers, WWII historians, all know this to be true.   Documentary evidence shows this to be true.  Yet, revisionists still  believe otherwise.<br />I am glad this book raised the questions that it did.   I enjoy historical debate.  But the debate is over.  Do not trust this  book.  It ignores evidence, facts, and history.	2000-06-19

I especially dislike revisionist history dealing with the ending of the Second World War and the Cold War.  Somehow, despite all common sense, reality, and historical evidence there  are people who believe, write and teach that Harry S. Truman had  alternative motives when he ended WWII by dropping atomic bombs on  Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />I am a big fan of Japanese history and culture.   I love it.  I have been to Japan two times.  However, it can not be denied  that Japan was not ready to surrender in August of 1945.<br />The Bottom line  is this, Harry Truman bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the Second World  War.  He did it to end the war quickly.  He did it to save American lives.   He did it to save Japanese civilians.<br />Truman did not use the atomic bombs  for nuclear diplomacy with the Russians.  He did not use it because of  racial biases.  Fortunately this book, which is really a collection of  documents sets the record straight.<br />Harry Truman was a great president.   He was honest and he was not afraid to make tough decisions.  The bombing  of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was one of those tough but neccessary decisions  that Truman fortunately had the moral courage to make.<br />Historians and  fans of history should look at this book and the documents discussed.   Revisionists will unfortunately ignore the evidence and spread bad  information.  But in reality, this book helps set the record straight.	2000-06-18

It cost the lives of over 25 million people.  In addition it helped set the stage for the collapse of the Qing Dynasty and the whole Dynastic System which ruled  China for 1000's of years.<br />Though also a biography, the Devil Soldier is  an interesting overview of the Rebellion and its eventual defeat.  This  book is much more readable than Spence's &quot;Gods Chinese  Son.&quot;<br />Carr is a great writer, his novels are great historical  mysteries of early NYC.  This book benefits froms Carr's ability to write  and tell a story.<br />Anyone interesting in this time period will enjoy this  book.  Again it is much better than the one on basically the same topic by  Spence.	2000-06-16

Taoism is one of the most interesting of the Chinese religion/philosophies.  The idea of &quot;The Tao,&quot; Yin and Yang, balance, and going with the flow of nature in my opinion is very  interesting and something we all need to look at.<br />There are many great  translations of Taoist texts and books that interpret them.  However, not  everyone is big into East Asian philosophy.  It is for those people I  recommend this version and this entire series of cartoon Chinese philosophy  books.  They are really cute, make good gifts, and are great in the  classroom.<br />I recommend this book for teachers and as a gift.  People who  are deep into this stuff, will understandably have problems with these  books.  However, for beginners, kids, and as a gift these books are great.	2000-06-10

And events would set  in motion Sun Yatsen's attempt at Democracy, the rise of the Warlords, and  a civil war that would lead to the Founding of the Peoples Republic in  1949.  So the Taiping Rebellion is a pivotal event in Chinese and World  History.<br />Spence is the big name in Chinese History.  This book got great  reviews.  The topic is interesting.  But personally I found the book too  tough to read and enjoy.  Too me a good history book is one that you enjoy  while reading and learning.  Just look at Orville Schell's Mandate of  Heaven.  In my opinion Spence did not write a good book.  Academic yes,  readable no.	2000-05-31

And let's face it, most of what we have you read is kinda boring.  However, there are a couple of books we assign which are really worth it.  NO, not a Seperate Peace or Alls Quiest, but books  like To Kill a Mockingbird, Julius Caesar, and Catcher in the  Rye.<br />Catcher in the Rye is a great book.  The adventures of Holden  Caufield will be enjoyed.  Holden's mental collapse and visit to NYC are  just as relevent now as when Salinger wrote this book years ago.<br />This is  a book that after you are forced to read it in school, that you will read  again on your own.

This book was great.<br />The stories all take place on the  border of China and the USSR during the early 1970s when the two communist  countries actually came pretty close to war.  The stories are actually a  microcosim of Communist China as a whole.<br />The stories are wonderful and I  highly recommend this book not just to sinophiles but to anyone who wants  to read a great collection of stories.	2000-05-26

Eastern religion is very different from Western Religion.  Rather than focusing on God and mans relationship with God, many of the Eastern Religions are more  philosophical and advocate a way of life.  This is why many people in East  Asia practice elements of all of these religions and in many cases do not  even know they are.  It is also with this in mind that Buddhism became to  popular in China and other parts of Asia.  Buddhism unlike Taoism or  Confucianism dealt with an afterlife.<br />Well sorry for the lecture, in  terms of Taoism I like this translation very much.  I found it well  presented and very easy to follow.  Taoism and the whole idea of the way,  Ying and Yang, balance and harmony with nature too me is one of the most  interesting of the world's religions.  Anyone who would like to read about  this philosophy/religion would enjoy this book.<br />It is food for thought.	2000-05-21

I think the whole idea of the McWorld vs. the Jihad is brilliant.  The author did a great job explaining both worlds and how in many ways they cause each other and how they effect society and democracy.<br />Personally, I  found the author to come off a bit snobby at times and I felt the last  couple of chapters wound down in economic jargon that I did not fully  understand.  I am a history person and I do not have much background in  economics, so it is easy to confuse me.<br />However, on the whole this book  was great.  It was very readable and the book always made you think.  The  world of religious extremism scares me.  Whether it is ultraorthodox Jews,  born-again Christians, or the real Jihad I am not a fan of religious  extremism.  The idea of McWorld really does not scare me that much.  I have  been to China and seen Pepsi posters on every corner and KFC's on every  street.  I really do not think that is such a bad thing.  What scares me  about McWorld was best illustrated in NY recently with Disney vs. Time  Warner.  The world of music, computers, sports teams, stadiums,internet,  movies, etc. is increasingly more and more under the control of a very few  people and groups.  I do not think that is a good trend at all.  That  scares me much more than seeing a Kenny Rogers Roasters in Beijing.<br />I  highly recommend this book.  It is easy to read, until the last few pages,  and will make you think.  Read this and then pick up any of the great works  of Robert D. Kaplan and compare.	2000-05-21

The novel is a interesting and entertaining look at modern Israel  and the issues of security and peace it shares with its neighbors.<br />I  enjoyed the book very much and was very interested in its depiction of  Israel.

However, the original Rogue Warrior autobiography was the only book I ever read where people actually stopped me to tell me they read the book and loved it.  It is that good.<br />Currently Marcinko and  Weisman co-author novels which are fiction but possibly based on real  situations.  the rest of the series is fiction but its the type of fiction  that borders on being or at least seems real.<br />But this book, the first  and the actual autobiography of Marcinko is unbelievable.  Exciting,  interesting, historical it does it all.  No fiction you will read will ever  match this book.

Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Albanians, Eastern Orthodox, Muslims, the issues are complex and there are many players.  It  is not an easy issue to figure out.<br />In 1989, Kaplan visited many of the  regions in the Balkans and simply talked to people from different ethnic  groups, areas, and religions.  The result is a informative, easy to read,  history of the region and its conflicts that was way ahead of its  time.<br />In Reading Balkan Ghosts, you see first hand how the various groups  in the region feel about each other.  YOu see first hand how old hatred,  very old hatred in some cases is the root cause of todays problems.   Grudges going back to the days of the Ottoman Empire are still held.  If  you want to learn why there are problems in the Balkans, what these  problems are than read this book.<br />Kaplan is a great author. All his books  are great reads, and unfortunately too true.  Kaplan predicted what  happened in the former Yugoslavia and his other books warn of the coming  global anarchy from places like the Balkans, Africa etc.<br />I highly  recommend this book.	2000-05-20

I have read Into Thin Air Twice now and it is just as exciting the second time around.  I do not know enough about mountain climbing and what happened in May of 1996 on Everest so I can not comment on who did the  right thing on the mountain.  What I can comment on is that this book is  great.<br />The author was originally on Mt. Everest to see and write about  organizations like Mountain Madness and Adventure Consultants who for high  fees would take less experienced climbers to the top of the worlds largest  mountain.  Tragically we see as the author does the result of a crowded  mountain, inexperienced climbers,lack of oxygen, and bad weather.<br />People  can point fingers all they want at who did what.  But the bottom line is  that the author has written a classic.  Read this book.	2000-05-19

Especially the chapter about  the USS Scorpion, while other chapters were incredibly boring.<br />So in  short, this book is a mixed bag.  The subject is very interesting.

It is incredibly short and pretty expensive for the amount of book you get.  So recommend taking this book out of the library or waiting for the paperback.  Enough said  about this.<br />This book and its essays are extremely important.  As with  his other works, Robert D. Kaplan has shown once again that he is right on  the money about the problems in the post-cold war 3rd world.  Or should I  say the places in the world other than North America, the Pacific Rim, and  Western Europe.<br />Kaplan, like in his excellend &quot;Ends of the  Earth&quot; has illustrated the effects of overpopulation, tribalism,  crime, famine, and AIDS.  He also writes a very interesting essay on  Democracy.  I also enjoyed his essay on Kissinger.<br />The bottom line is  this.  This book is about some very real and very scary stuff.  Kaplan who  accurately warned the West about the breakup of the the former Yugoslavia  in Balkan Ghosts, is again warning us of problems that can only spread and  spread.  Kaplan is a great writer and his warnings need to be listened too.	2000-05-12

I am a high school teacher, trust me on this one.  A Separate Peace, All Quiet on Western Front...boring.  However, two books did standout in my  opinion.  Catcher in the Rye and To Kill a Mockingbird.<br />To Kill a  Mockingbirg is such a good book.  The characters, the trial, but more  importantly about race.<br />I loved this book as a kid and I love it as an  adult.  Please, if you are assigned to read this book do so, I know the  temptation for cliffnotes is there, and use them for a Separate Peace.  But  if you are assigned To Kill A Mockingbirg, read it.

There are more books about the American Civil War than on any other subject in US history.  New books are written everyday.  Some are very good, some are not.  However, despite all the new enteries to the field of study in my opinion the best is some of the oldest.  In my opinion no one  writes better about the Civil War than Bruce Catton.  In this work he looks  at the Civil War from the Union point of view.  But regardless, it is one  of the best single volume histories of the war.  And despite its age,  Catton's works has stood the test of time.  His history is good and  accurate.  And he can write.  Catton discusses good history and tells it in  beautiful writing.  This could be a novel.  There are a lot of books on the  Civil War, however there are not a lot of writers as good as Catton.	2000-05-04

That may be true, I don't know.  However it is very clear that this is agenda history or left-wing propaganda more than it is history.  Like most of his works, the author's politics and obvious  dislike of certain President's has clouded the story he is trying to sell.   I am not saying the US was a saint regarding Latin America, but I would  trust a more neutral history of the issue rather than a book that is  biased.  The author is very selective in the quotes and other references he  uses to back his book.  Listen, we supported some bad people in Latin  America at times, the US certainly made mistakes...but if you are writing a  &quot;history&quot; book be fair and objective and not so obviously  political.  I get the impression that the author felt he would have been  the best President or Secretary of State as opposed to the people who  actually had those jobs.  He would have done everything great as opposed to  all the people who actually had those jobs and did not have the benefit of  historical 20/20 hindsight. It is easy to sit in Cornell and write how  horrible Kissinger or Reagan was knowing how events turned out.  Being a  diplomat is something else.  Diplomats and leaders do not have option  knowing how events turned out or what was really happening or happened  behind closed doors in other places.  This author has lost site of this.   The author needs to tell more history and preach less.	2000-05-03

The 5th Profession is a  great example of the good old Morrell.  From the dramatic opening,  retelling the Japanese 47 Ronin Story the book will grab you.  The contrast  and commonalities between a former Navy Seal and a Ronin Samurai make great  reading.  This is a fun book to read on the train, plane, or beach.

I liked this book because the author was very honest about his snoring problem and the problems it creates for  others.  It is a short book and does not take long to read.

Masks, surgery, nose strips, tennis balls, all  &quot;supposed&quot; cures which did not work for the author or most  snorers.

If you want to read and author who varies his work, is easy to read, is exciting, and creates great characteres: read his works.  Spencerville is pretty good.  It is not his best work.  The Gold  Coast wins that title easily, but the book is a good read.  An interesting  story about a former secret agent of some sorts returning home and starting  over.  If you have not read Demille: START!  If you liked this book make  sure to read: Catherdal, Word of Honor, and especially the Gold Coast.	2000-04-29

His Lady and the Monk: 4 Seasons in Kyoto is by far the most beautiful book I have ever read.  It was magical.  In many ways his stories in Video Night are just as  wonderful.  A bit dated, a believe the book was written in the late 80's  but still very topical, still very though provocating, and still awesome to  read.  Iyer has a wondeful ability to tell a story and to make u feel that  you are in the places he writes about.  Pico Iyer is a great writer and if  you like travel narrativer or are interested in Asia, check out his works.	2000-04-28

Like in his book about Okinawa, Operation Iceburg, Gerald Astor has written another oral biography of a major WWII battle. This time, the Battle of the Bulge.  And like Operation Iceburg, this book is terrific.  It is really like being there.  Astor has allowed the veterans to tell  their own story and in doing so one clearly sees the importance of what our  young men did in the 1940s to save the world from the Nazis.  Read this  book and thank a WWII veteran.	2000-04-28

To kill time on the plane and other down periods during the trip, I brought this book along with me.  I really enjoyed being in Portugal, in Lisbon and Sintra, while reading this book.  The combination of the setting and the  authors historical description was great.  However, the actual story took  second fiddle.  The mystery was OK.  So anyone interested in a good period  peace, a good fictional description of what happened to the Jews of  Portugal will enjoy this book.  Lovers of a good mystery will find the book  OK.	2000-04-28

IN a nutshell, Jordan and Nike are symbolic of middle class economic success.  This is the direction we want things to go.  If there is any chance for a  world free of anarchy we need countrys with strong middle classes.  Strong  middle classes usually leads towards democracy.  Unfortunately many  countries are going in the opposite direction.  They are chosing anarchy,  or fundamentalism.  It seems the author of this book, as he usually does,  has misinterpreted history.  As usual he finds fault with anything good  America does.  The author has a problem with the spread of American values,  American capitalism, and American Democracy.  I would hate to see the world  the author would like to live in.  However, we can see glances of it now:  look at the problems in Africa, or the Middle East.  I will take middle  class capitalism and democracy over fundamentalism any day.  If you want to  read some revisionist junk economics...read this book.	2000-04-15

I have read and heard that he is one of the top authorities on the Russian Revolution.  The book was well written and very informative.  However, while far from a revisionist, I found his explanation too  conservative and way too political towards the right wing.  His arguements  that WWI and the Czars oppressive government were not as important to the  revolution as we like to think is a bit much.  I can't buy into that even  as a traditionalist and anti-revisionist.  Pipe's just seemed a little too  preachy a little too political in his explanations.  I feel he, though from  another prospective, is no better than the revisionists in letting his  politics take away from his history.  I think it is a good investment of  time to read this little book, but take it with a grain of salt.  Right  wing salt.	2000-03-25

I am not Asian and I can not relate personally to what the author felt and was trying to say.  The book was eye opening and quite powerful.  I guess many of us have identity issues, no matter what our background.  This  society creates many self-fulfilling prophecies.  How everyone else thinks  we should act.  And unfortunately, we sometimes act like others want and  expect us to.  I read this book for a course on School and the community.   We were looking at the stereotype of the Asian wiz kid in education and  whether or not that was a true stereotype and the implications of thinking  a kid is smart just because they are Asian. I am glad I came across this  book, and even happier that I took the time to read it.	2000-03-20

For the money, I  figured this book was a better buy!<br />The book was excellent.  The real  strenght of this book was the great use of primary sources and the great  job the author did on Mao's early life and the history of China from the  fall of the Qing Dynasty to the founding of the People's Republic in  1949.<br />The only faults I had with the book were the post-1949 years with  the exception of the chapters on the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural  Revolution.  The author just did not do as good a job of the post-1949 Mao  and China.  However, the pre-1949 stuff was great.<br />The book was well  written and easy to read despite the size of the book.  I enjoyed reading  the book and learned a lot and felt it was time well spent.

Instead of focusing on his films, Jackie Chan spends most of the book describing growing up in Hong Kong and his days in an Opera school.  Sure there is some great stuff about  his films.  The annotated filmography in the back is awesome.  But what I  loved about this book was that it was not all about Police Story this and  Drunken Master that, instead it is a wonderful look at a different culture  and the rewards of hard work and training.

I have had the fortunate experience of visiting Japan twice and seeing some Japanese baseball.  It was an experience I shall never forget.  Curious about the subject I picked up and read this awesome book.  However,  as much as this book is about baseball.  And it is filled with some great  stories and information.  I wonder how much this book is really about the  cultural differences between the United States and Japan.  Using the  history of Japanese baseball and the rough experiences of many of the  American players who have tried to play in Japan, the author does an  awesome job teaching about Japanese culture.  This is much more than a  baseball book.  Its about baseball and culture, and cultural diffusion, and  the differences between Americans and Japanese.  This is a funny book, a  fun to read book, but you will learn alot about Japan by the time you are  done.  I have even assigned this book to my students.  This book is worth  it.

First and foremost it is a powerful and emotional look at Rabin, not as a world leader, but as a grandfather.   That is what made the authors speech at his funeral so  moving.  Despite praise from leaders around the world, when his grand  daughter spoke and spoke of Rabin in very human terms it was a powerhouse  of emotions.  But the book is more than just a look at a grandfather by his  grand daughter.  Its a powerful cry for peace between Jews and Muslims in  the Middle East.  It is a book about the effects of the Palestinian/Muslim  Israeli Conflict.  Because of the authors age while writing this book, it  is a good book for high school kids about the crisis in that part of the  world.  Prepare to be very moved if you read this book.	2000-02-27

Popular notion is that Lee was one of our greatest Generals and against  slavery.  Nolan makes some bold statements.  They are intriguing.

This is one of the best and most important books ever written.  This is the only book I ever read that I actually agreed with 100%  This book made me talk out loud and cheer.  The Disuniting of America looks at the  consquences of teaching false and sometimes incorrect multiculturalism.  I  agree, when did our country no longer become a melting pot?  American  History is something we all share in common, something that should be used  to unite us not divide us.  The author also makes a great case against the  teaching of often made up feel good multicultural history.  Having taught  the old New York state global studies curriculum I know first hand that  African-American Students are no more interested in African history than  they are of Asian history and so on.  This book should be mandatory reading  for all social studies teachers.	2000-02-26

Yes, a history of Feudal Japan.  Oh, yes its a novel.  Yes it is filled with action, romance, sex, politics, and cultural diffusion.  But other than  changing the names, the book is really a history of how the Tokugawa  Shogunate was established.  The book is a history of Will Adams, Tokugawa  Ieyasu, with background and references to Nobunaga and Hideyoshi.  But  again, though it is really a history Shogun is much more.  This is by far  the best book I have ever read.  As long as the book is, you don't want it  to end.  Honestly, I never liked Clavell's other books, Gai-Jin, Taipan,  etc.  but Shogun is the best.  Shogun is one of those books you will always  remember.	2000-02-26

It is an interesting mix and a fair look at both sides of the Cold War.  But there is the  problem as well.  Too much of the book and the evidence from both the US  and USSR at times contradict each other, while at other times supports each  other.  In short, the chapters are confusing.  Who is right?  Who is wrong?   For example their Cuban Missile Crisis chapters where interesting, but  heck if I can draw a conclusion as to what really happened.  Also, the  title.  The title is wrong.  It is clear that the US and the West one the  cold war.  I think that is an undisputed fact.  So again, the book has good  information, but it is at times too much.  The book is ultimately too much  info and not enough conclusions.	2000-02-25

However, the editors are revisionists and their explanation of the documents is very suspect.  The editors put this collection together and based their  commentary on the idea that United States foreign policy has always been  evil, all the &quot;dead white guys&quot; who made these policies are evil,  and everything we did during the cold war and Vietnam reflect that evil.  I  am not saying I agree with the Vietnam War.  However, what I am saying is  that if you are presenting documents present them fairly and in the proper  context.  The editors fail to do this.  Their commentary reflects what they  are trying to push: bad revisionist junk history.  For an even handed look  at the Vietnam War look at Karnow's Vietnam book.  This book is dangerous  in that if you don't have a background in the cold war or Vietnam, you  might buy into this revisionist junk.	2000-02-25

His World at War series, How few Remain, and his Great War Series.  I have hated them all and stopped half way through.  However, his plots keep intriguing me and I  always find myself buying his latest books.  Guns of the South was the one  book of his I liked.

Midway is a  Battle so exciting that fiction could never top it, and yet this was  history.  And this book captures the battle brilliantly.  Walter Lord also  did a great job in Incredible Victory.

This book, which is a culmination of many of his works on Jackson, is a masterpiece of biography.  Highly readable, Remini shows why Jackson was  one of the best Presidents we ever had.  Remini does a good job on not just  what Jackson did, but the man himself.  Jackson's personality and how and  why he was the way he was is a major focus of Remini.  I especially enjoyed  reading about Jackson's duels and his actions during the South Carolina  Nulification.  It is not political correct to like Jackson, but you can not  deny he was one of our best and most important Presidents.  This is a great  biography of a great man.	2000-02-22

David Mccullough's book on Truman is great.  It is well written, full of great information, and though many people think too pro-Truman it does show why he was a Great Man.  Unfortuantely many professors and especially those  with Revisionist Tendancies don't feel Mccullough's book is scholary.  They  see it as Pop History.  I think this is academic snobbery, and also  stubborness upon the part of the revionists to admit Truman was a great  President.  However, a good way to silence the revisonists and to read  another great book on Truman is to read Hamby's Man of the People.  Though  a little more critical than Mccollough, Hamby again paints a great portrait  of a great man.  For whatever reasons, Hamby is considered more scholary  and his book more scholary.  Whatever makes our Professors happy.  But  regardless, this is a great book.  Though long like Mccollough, it tells a  great story.  Hamby is a fine historian who was also on c-spans look at  Truman for its President's series.  So in short, a more  &quot;academic&quot; but just as great book on Truman.	2000-02-22

In telling the stories of Lee and Grant, Smith is really writing a neat book on the Civil War.  I found this book to be very informative and highly readable.

I had the unfortunate experience of taking a college level Vietnam Course that was completely one sided.  The course was openly hostile to the American point of view and too sympathetic to the Communists.  I am not  saying I agreed with the war, but I feel a course or a book on the war  should show boths side.  I feel Karnow does this in his book.  the book is  well written and easy to read.  Plus it does a good job of showing all the  points of view of the war.  Anyone looking for a book with a good  background and overall history of the war should get this book.

This was an excellent little read.  The book offers an unique look at the German army during WWII  under Hitler.  It was unique in that it focused attention the non-SS,  ordinary soldiers of the German army and their role and responsiblity in  WWII.  I recommend reading this book at Gordon Craigs's Politics of the  Prussian Army.	2000-02-21

I remember my Professor, Blakemore, hyping the book.  He was right.  Based on this book, it is easy to see why Gordon Craig is  considered one of the best Historians when it comes to Germany.  This book  is not only a history of the German army, but it is really a history of  Germany it self.  It was especially interesting to read about the  importance of the Blood Oath of Loyalty taken by the German Army to Hitler  before WWII.  If you are interested in Germany, I highly recommend this  book.	2000-02-18

It is in my opinion won of the best books written on Russian History.  So, I was excited to see he wrote a book on the Scramble for Africa and the actions  of Belgium in the Congo.  I have often heard people in my history classes,  who have come from black studies departments, compare Leopold II to Hitler  and Stalin.  I was always interested to know if that was an accurate  statement.  Hochschild supports that arguement and in the introduction and  the back of the book mentions the terrible atrocities committed by the  Belgiums in the Congo.  While, the book was well written, I don't think  Hochschild fully and adequately backed his statements and hypothesis.  Too  me, the book failed to prove Leopold II is in the same league as a Hitler  or Stalin.  Could he be? Was he? I don't know or still know even after  reading the book.  I found this book more informative about Henry Stanely  than about atrocities committed by Leopold.  The thesis still might be  true, but the book failed to prove it.	2000-02-18

Hitlers Willing Executioners makes an  important point, but is impossible to read.  This book did a nice job  explaining the work in plain English.  Also the book has an interesting  chapter on David Irving.  I also really enjoyed the chapters dealing with  Hitler's sexuality and Freudian Interpretations.

It compares the memory and guilt of WWII in modern Germany and Japan.  It looks at how the Germans of today and the Japanese of today look at their countries role in WWII and responsibilty  for many atrocities.  Readers will be shocked to see how many people in  Japan show no remorse or understanding for their role in WWII.  While,  Germans tend to carry an intense amount of guilt for the war.  This makes  for some thought provoking reading.  And unfortunately, as much as I love  Japan and Japanese culture...my visits to Hiroshima confirm the thesis of  this book	2000-02-17

The idea that the religious beliefs of the Japanese, a mix of Zen, Buddhism, Shinto, and a bit of Confucianism, created a Protestant like Work ethic in Japan.  It is intriguing.  The  Weber thesis of Western Europe and the North American states that the  Protestant religion ground in many a pull yourself up by the bootstraps  mentality is a good one.  Look at the economic and industrial success of  majority Protestant countries vs. majority Catholic countries.  Bellah  carries this type of idea to the Japanese.

This is a very telling fact and an interesting question.  Southern Honor is an interesting look at the concept of Honor in the south  and how it tied into the culture of the whole region and all classes.  When  Northerners attack the south for slavery, because of the concept of honor,  it became not just an attack on the slave owners, or the rich southerners  it was an attack on the whole region and culture.  This is an important  fact when looking at the causes of the civil war.  I enjoyed reading this  book, I learned a lot from it, and it helped to explain why many  Southerners did what they did.  This is an important book to read when  studying the civil war or the history of the South.	2000-02-16

It does such a good job putting you there.  You feel like you are at the meeting between Mandela and DeKlerk.  This is history at its best.  Anyone  interested in Current Events or the History of South Africa and its  transformation from Apartheid and White Rule to One Man One Vote and  Democracy needs to read this book.  I had no idea that Mandela and the  South African government had been in negotiation long before Mandela's  release.  I also had no idea how well Mandela used his ability to speak  Afrikaaner and his knowledge of Afrikaaner History to while negotiating to  end Apartheid.  You see the challenges DeKlerk, Mandela, and all of South  Africa had to overcome.  And they did.  This is a short book, but after  reading this you will become an expert on the events that led to the end of  Apartheid and the beginning of Democracy in South Africa.

However, it is more than just a travel narrative, it is also an interesting look at an American living as a Buddhist Monk in Japan.   The book is very cute and charming at times.  The only thing I did not  like was the constant lack of chronological order to the story.   Personally, it was a bit much at times.  However, the book is well written,  informative, and funny.  I stayed one night in a Buddhist Monk in Japan.   One unforgettable night in Kyoto.  Chadwick spent much longer, and some of  his stories are incredible.

I am a Japanophile and everyone thought this book would be for me.  I tried reading it and never got past the first few pages.  However, a few days ago  I saw the paper back edition and read the comments of Pico Iyer.  Pico Iyer  is the author of the great book on Japan called the Lady and the Monk.   Reading his comments, I decided to give the book another try.  I am glad I  did.  This book is wonderful.  I am not a liberal, I disagree with the  re-location of the Japanese citizens during WWII, but I don't think it was  as horrible as many of the revisonists make it out to be.  I am not  defending it, but people who compare it to the Rape of Nanking or the  Holocaust are going to far.  Again, it was a bad thing, but at least we  admitt to it and own up to it.  But anyway, that aside the book is great.   Not only is it an exciting courtroom drama/suspense...the characters are so  rich and interesting.  And the look at the effects of the re-location of  the Japanese Americans on themselves and the community they live in is done  in a very affective manner.  This is simply a great book.  Anyone who wants  a good read should pick this book up.  And guys, its not just a girls  book...this is a good read.	2000-02-14

The idea that the German people themselves were anti-semtic and the role  this played in the Holocaust and the ability for Hitler to do what he did  is something I agree with.

Its kinda slow, but its well written and quite interesting.  The setting: Kyoto...what a place.  This is one of those must see cities.  The book I feel makes more sense and one can  get more out of it after a trip to Kyoto.  Read this book while at the same  time look at Pico Iyers: Lady and the Monk 4 Seasons in Kyoto.

A fictional history of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the unification of Japan under his families Shogunate.  The references to Hideyoshi, Nobunaga, and other aspects of  Japanese history add to the fun.  Like Lonesome Dove, despite the size of  the book, you will not want it to end.  I suggest reading a little Japanese  history first and then read the novel.  Anyone interested in Japan or just  a good book should read it.	2000-02-04

Graphic, disturbing, and yet giving you a great appreciation  for what our WWII veterans accomplished in the Pacific.  This book should  be mandatory reading on WWII.

China is a must trip  but it is a mixed bag.  its so big and so vast.  The Lonely Plant Guide is  a must for both before and during.  The beginning of the book does an  incredible job preparing you for your trip and exposing you to Chinese  culture.  While there the maps and the listings are extremely helpful and  are must reads.  The guide is opinionated and most often accurate.  I will  always remember the description of the Ming tombs as an empty bank vault.   They were 100% correct.  Its a great book, and a valuable tool to get the  most out of your trip.

Manchester clearly shows MacArthur as a modern day paradox.  Manchester shows MacArthur's triumps and defeats.  What I enjoyed  about the book is how anyone reading this book as a MacAthur admirer would  find plenty of material to back up their position, while clearly seeing why  some people might feel differently.  Conversly, for MacArthur detractors,  there is a clear case as to why MacAthur was a bad general, but detractors  are exposed to why many people think MacArthur was great.  This is  biography at its best.  Balance and informative.  Read this along with the  novel the Emperors General and the non fiction Embracing Defeat.	2000-01-29

The book does a great job, in the form of very readable historical fiction, of showing how MacArthur help to defeat Japan  at the end of WWII and then peacefully transform it to a democratic highly  industrialized friend of the US.  You see that it was not an easy job and  that we did have to make some sacrifices.  Yes the Emperor and some of his  family committed war crimes, yes The Tiger was probably innocent, but  MacArthur saw the big picture and knew what had to be done to transfer the  Japanese mentality of Okinawa to the mentality that allowed for a peaceful  and successful occupation period.  A Great read and I recommend reading it  along side &quot;Embracing Defeat.&quot;	2000-01-23

It provides a very readable and informative look at the state of Japan at the beginning of the US occupation at the end of WWII.  However, later in the book I feel it drags  too much and tries to present too much information.  So, while I enjoyed  the first 300 pages very much I did not like the 2nd half.  The author I  feel is also a little to sympathetic to the Japanese.  Yes, Its reasonable  to feel bad for all the displaced Japanese soldiers in Korea, China  etc....but i the author i feel overlooks why those soldiers were there and  what they did.  Again, the book is well researched and at times brilliant.   But I feel it is too long and at times just a bit too Pro-Japanese.  I  recommend after reading this book that you read the novel &quot;The  Emperors General.&quot;	2000-01-23

At time Embracing Defeat is great and informative reading.  At other times it is too dry.  I felt the first 300 pages of this book were very good.  The second half was too dry.  Also, at times the book is too sympathic to  the Japanese.  It is difficult to feel much sympathy for the misplaced and  stranded Japanese left in places like China and Korea.  The crimes  committed by these troops far outweights their struggles to return to  Japan.  I believe the author is married to a Japanese woman which can cloud  his view of Japan.

This book as with most revisionist history is an attempt to  justify some sort of left-wing political agenda.  Just read how the book  makes Henry Wallace into some sort of hero while Harry Truman is made into  a villian.  This book often ignores the facts and current documentary  evidence.  For good cold war history read Gaddis, or Ferrell not this!	1999-07-27

Yet this book was extremely interesting and informative.  But, this should be no surprise because that  has always been Dr. Bowen's gift.  I had the pleasure of taking 3 Geography  courses with him at Mary Washington College and he was as interesting in  person as he is on print.  Dr. Bowen could turn the most dry Geography  course into the most interesting class on campus.  In a country where most  people do not know a thing about Geography, just watch Jay Leno, we need  people like Dr. Bowen who can teach and entertain at the same time.  He is  the Patch Adams of Geography!  Read this book and even better...go to MWC  and take his class.	1999-07-25

Hummel's writng is not too bad and the bibliographic essays at the end of each  chapter are interesting.  However, his history is off as is most  revisionist history.  The causes of the Civil War were not economic and the  results of the Civil War is not big government.  Hummels writing seems to  be a sort of justification for his personal political views.  One is much  better off reading Foote, Fields, or Catton	1999-07-22

This was the first James Lee Burke novel I had ever read and it was so good that within a summer of reading Dixie City Jam, I had read all of his New Iberia novels.  A beautifully detailed, exciting, well written myster.   Burke is the best, I recommend this novel and all his other works	1998-11-16

He was patient and brilliant.  He waited for just the right moment to make his move and unify Japan under his Shogunate.  Unfortunately little is  availible about this great man in English.  Clavell's Shogun is a  masterpiece based on Ieyasu's life, but ultimately fiction.  Totman's book  is a rare English biography of Ieyasu.  And Totman wrote an excellent and  highly readable account of Ieyasu's life.	1998-11-10

Maybe its how wondeful I  thought Kyoto was.  Maybe it was my failed romance with a beautiful  Japanese girl.  Whatever the cause, this book struck a nerve.  It was like  I was transported back to the beautiful city of Kyoto.  The whole time I  read this book, I truely felt like I was back in Japan.  The descriptions  of the city and its people, plus the contrast of Western expecations and  Japanese realities made this book almost magical.  This book is a must for  those who have been to Japan and still think about their magical stays  there.  It is a must for those of us who still try to cling onto the  memories of our visits.	1998-09-30

Down and Out in the Middle Kingdom is not the best book on China.  In my  Opinion &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot; by Orville Schell is, and Simon  Winchester's book on his journey along the Yangtze river are.  But Brown is  not far from the truth is portraying China as at times gray and depressing.   I have been reading and interested in China for years, but my recent trip  to China this summer was very anti-climatic.  China has some great stuff  and people, but the bottom line is that much of China is polluted, gray,  and depressing.  Anyone going to China and expecting Japan or the China of  Mulan is in for a rude awakening.  A trip to China is at times wonderful,  and at times very trying and depressing.  Its a mixed bag.  This book  acurately shows this aspect of China.  Its a place of magical places and  people, but its also a place of some not so great things.  This book is a  good read for its realism.	1998-09-07

As a teacher, Sinophile, and Japophile i get to read about these places  more than i can visit them.  So to hold me over between trips, I devour  travel narratives of East Asia.  Simon Winchester's beautiful,  entertaining, and informative narrative of his journey along the Yangtze  River is a classic.  If you are planning a trip to China or just dreaming  about it....Winchester's book is a must.  Grab a lonely planet guide,  Orville Schells Mandate of Heaven, and Winchester's book and you will be  set.  I could and read this book all day!	1998-09-07

Iron and Silk is one of those great  books that give you the feel for China and the Chinese people.  I read this  book before my trip to China in the summer of 1998.  Though the book is  dated a bit, it is a must read before any trip to China or for any armchair  traveller.  I loved the way Salzman combined martial arts, calligraphy, tai  chi with his other observations about China.  My only problem with the book  is that Salzman comes off a little to perfect...he always succeeds in this  or masters that.....just a little to self serving.   But that is just a  little criticism of an  otherwise great read about China.	1998-09-07

I remember before I left for my first trip to Japan in 1996, reading about  Feiler and his adventures  in an Onsen hot springs.  I remember his  description of having to take of all his clothes and bathe in front of all  these Japanese guys he just met.  Any yet, during my trip in 1996 the same  thing happened to me!  I felt just like Feiler!  The book is informative  about Japanese culture and at the same time a great read.  Its a must read  if you plan to visit Japan...especially if you are a teacher.	1998-09-06

A book that  you really learn something from.  Mandate of Heaven is such a book.  If you  really want to learn about modern post-Mao China, read this book.  It's  easy to read, enjoyable, and yet you learn so much.  This is truely the  best book out there on China.	1998-09-01

Having been a resident of Fredericksburg, Virginia for five years deep in  the heart of Virginia Civil War Country, I can relate to this book.   Horwitz truly, accurately, and intelligently looks at the people and the  issues surrounding the Civil War and its memory and lasting impact.

This neat little mystery added flavor to my trips between  the Japanese cities of Kyoto, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Himeji.  The book is  well written, the mystery  is suspensfull, and the book give you a great  feel for modern Japan.  I highly recommend this book to people with an  interest in Japan, or who just want a good read.	1998-09-01

I haved used the Gateway to Japan guide book on two trips to Japan.  And I  have to say, that this guide book is the best.  This book isn't the most  colorful, it doesn't list the best hotels and restaurants, however it does  much more.  The Gateway book tells you not only where to go, but also gives  you in depth information and history about the locations.  This is a book  that will complement your trip and add background information to make your  visits complete.    ON a personal note, I got lost one day in '96 while  trying to find the 47 Ronin temple.  And thanks to the Gateway book, I was  able to make it home.    Again, its the best.  This is the book to take to  Japan.	1998-09-01
