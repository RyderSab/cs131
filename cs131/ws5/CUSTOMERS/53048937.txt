Sensitively written, with attention paid to the emotional reactions of the children and adults who must deal with the death of someone they know -- even when it's someone they don't particularly like or who was mean, which is the case with Matthew (Stinky) Stern. The teacher's guides provided on the author's website provide discussion questions that will help when talking about this book -- whether you're a teacher, librarian, parent, or caregiver. This is another excellent addition to the Jackson Friends series, which many of the teachers we've talked to are using because of the varied backgrounds of the students in the book.	2005-09-12

The Water Gift -- a few rare people are given the gift of detecting water with a divining rod and a respect for the earth. These are two of the fascinating elements in this wonderful book, along with a young heroine who is an optimistic explorer. When her grandfather listens to one too many crabby neighbors and loses faith in himself--and the Pig of the Pig wanders away, it is Isabel who figures out what to do to set things right. A perfect combination of story and illustrations -- a lovely book.	2005-02-27

Carter's characters are well-drawn and believable, memorable months after reading the book. The book's challenges of everyday life have ties to contemporary life with themes of cultures clashing, labor struggles, gangs, and the desperation of poverty.

His retelling of the Arthurian legends is masterful. I'm going to read through all six of the books that make up the Squire's Tales (so far) to study how he develops in his writing. <br /> <br />This book is my favorite of his Squire's Tales. It isn't as jocular as the others, having a darker undertone with its themes of power and revenge, but it is gripping in its suspense. He also paces his twists and turns in a \\"don't put this book down\\" sort of way. <br /> <br />Sarah is a fully developed and complex main character and, while I won't spoil the surprising and delightful \\"battle cry\\" uttered first by Charis and then by Sarah, I completely intend to adopt it as my own. In fact, there are a number of girls and women who would gladly wear a t-shirt (the modern evolution of the banner worn into battle) that says ... \\"I am my own ...\\" Read the book and see. <br /> <br />This age has great good fortune to see the likes of Gerald Morris retelling the tales of De Troyes and Mallory.	2005-01-30

This dynamic duo has captured my imagination. I found myself torn between reading the footnotes and reading the story. I finally gave up and read all the footnotes through from beginning to end, even when I didn't know what they related to in the story. The history in this book is fascinating and I admire Millett's ability to turn his in-depth factual knowledge of the Twin Cities into a highly entertaining and deftly plotted mystery. There are surprising twists that I never saw coming, thorough characterizations, and--pleasingly--the emotional quality of the characters shines through without the restraints of Holmes' and Watson's prescripted personalities. Their minor involvement felt just right--enough to thread this book in with the series, but also enough to bring in the worldly knowledge that Rafferty wouldn't have. Highly entertaining. Millett has found the perfect heroes for the Gilded Age. Please give us more!	2005-01-28

The characters are cardboard cutouts of teens who don't seem to have any feelings other than the need to win--whether it's in class, training, love, or virtual reality. The characters quickly got on my nerves because they were so one-dimensional. The supposedly witty repartee felt forced. It was unbelievable. The chapter headings and endings (in a font that's nearly impossible to read) aren't tantalizing--because they float above the story somewhere, unconnected. This could have been a great series. It has a great premise, but it's nearly impossible to read--and I try to finish everything I read to give it a fair chance. Not this book.	2004-07-08

The daughter of a Scotswoman and a German farmer, Evie is by turns kind and ferocious, learning to deal with the death of her mother and the care of a loving aunt she has never met before. There are real characters in this book, painted keenly. Aunt Flo, who comes to live with Evie and Mae and their papa, her brother, is a shrouding woman. I confess to being reluctant to read this book because of Aunt Flo's work with death and funerals. Now I'm sorry that I waited so long. What did people do to care for their dead in a time before undertakers and mortuaries? With gentle explanation and intriguing description, this book is a look at this unusual aspect of history, woven deftly into a richly textured story.	2004-03-05

While it's true that many of the great fairy tales have morals, stories like Cinderella, Rapunzel, and Anansi the Spider have been re-told through the centuries because they are also whopping good yarns. There is no story here, no plot, no characterization (other than four girls who are apparently so alike that they can't--and don't wish to be--differentiated--and the fifth who soon becomes an indistinguishable part of the girl-group). If the author can apply her voice--which shines through the weak story--to a whopping good tale of her own, then she'll have a hit on her hands. Otherwise, this is destined to be one more celebrity book that will surely be discussed in future children's literature classes with a shake of the head and a \\"that was such a strange time in the history of children's books, wasn't it\\"?	2003-10-11

Each poem looks at geology (yes, geology) in a slightly different way and evokes a different perspective on tales that can be millions of years old. Peters' inventive word play depicts the movement of glaciers ... she dares them to get a speeding ticket. In \\"Instructions for the Earth's Dishwasher,\\" the continental plates get warned, \\"Remember, if anything breaks, it's your fault.\\" This book is sure to get heavy use in classrooms because of its approach to geology and the lively discussions that will follow. As examples of poetry, it'll be useful in all the grades, inspiring inventiveness and word play. Felstead's illustrations are right on the mark, adding to the energetic nature of the poetry, making use of predominant blues and greens to portray earthly elements. And what a terrific read-aloud at home: imagine the parent-child talks this will engender, making science a hot topic around the house. (It's fun for adults, too--all the better.) A must-have.	2003-09-04

When we left, I saw an older man reading it and he had a big smile on his face. My dentist said she's been giving a copy to graduating dental students ... of course. My cousin's graduating from dental school next spring, so I'm glad to have THAT gift problem solved. Besides, it's fun to read. Who would have thought that tooth-losing traditions would be different all over the world?

This young woman in the post-Civil War era leaves her confining Wisconsin farm home and journeys by herself to Chicago, a town she couldn't even imagine. The book realistically portrays how difficult it would have been for a lone woman (young girl, really) to find her way around the country, find a safe place to stay without any money (she has none to begin with and is robbed later on), and find a job without any skills or recommendations. Katherine is a winning character, with old-fashioned sensibilities that transfer well to the modern day. And, while this is a slower-paced book, take the time to savor the details of the era (A. LaFaye has a tremendous knowledge of history) and the friendships Katherine makes on her journey. I sure hope there's another Edith book forthcoming. I want to know what happened to her next!!!	2003-01-01

From The Year of the Sawdust Man to Nissa's Place to this book, Nissa has grown quite a bit, learning to accept her family's odd makeup. She still holds out the little-girl hope that her bohemian mother and more conservative father will find a way to get back together again, but with Papa and new wife Lara having a baby, the hope seems slimmer. Nissa's mother is more present in this book and she has grown quite a bit as well. I was struck by how well the adults are described in this book--from a child's eye view and yet I think Nissa understands them--and so does the reader. Nissa's industrious projects (so reminiscent of her mother) result in the East and West Harper libraries, a terrific analogy for the racial divide in the South of this time period. A. LaFaye is quickly becoming one of my favorite writers--her books are filled with humor, serious subjects, and a main character who walked off the page and into my heart. I heartily recommend this book.	2003-01-01

This story, told as it is from the alternating viewpoints of a girl and boy who shared a close-to-death experience, is full of powerful images and strong emotions. The cast of characters covers a wide range of personalities, some colorful, some heart-warming, and some downright mean. The plot grabs you and pulls you along, as the two teens leave their homes to live in town, meeting those who will be in their lives forever and others who'd like to send them back home. A wonderfully good read for older kids who enjoyed Little House on the Prairie.	2002-12-26

Her daughter, Nissa, has some of that spirit, but she also has a good share of her father's calm way of looking at the world. When something goes dreadfully awry in their family, Heirah Rae leaves, and Nissa and her father are left trying to understand. A book that will be enjoyed by teens and adults alike, A.

In turns winsome, funny, and heart-wrenching, Dear Papa is a book of letters from Isobel to her dad, who \\"went to heaven,\\" and her Aunt Izzy, her father's sister in California. We learn about Isobel's life in important moments, always through her particular lens on life. From being separated from her family when her mother can no longer cope with raising so many children and cleaning houses to support them, to being reunited when her mother (a Lutheran) marries a doctor (a Catholic), this is an observant, heartwarming book. Those of us who grew up in the Upper Midwest (a Lutheran) and married a gent (a Catholic) can most definitely identify with the words here. If you liked Jan Karon's Mitford books, or Lois Walfrid Johnson's Northwoods Adventures, or L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables, you'll enjoy Dear Papa.	2002-10-26

Written in free verse, Bessie's story is told by the people who attend her funeral, her family, friends, and acquaintances.

I've heard Frederick Douglass' name for years, all throughout history classes, but never had a really good idea of what he contributed to history. Ms. Weidt has done an excellent job of weaving pertinent facts about this hero's life into an intriguing narrative. Interesting for both children and adults, this book does much to evoke the strong-minded, highly-principled person who inspired so many others to follow his example. I highly recommend this book.	2001-06-07

What was real? What was just cinematic license? This book is enjoyable to read, the facts are presented clearly and well-documented, and there's no glossing over the uncomfortable parts as happens in so many books written for children. Ms. Thomas obviously respects the intelligence of her readers. I think a lot of adults will find this book the best place to start when finding out more about Good Queen Bess . . . or trying to figure out the conflicting views of her from the movies. On top of which, the book is just plain gorgeous--great drawings and color paintings. Thanks, Ms. Thomas!	2001-06-07

Even though I love fantasy novels, and the author said right up front that this wasn't a fantasy, the story caught me up and kept me going until the last page. I hope this isn't the only story about Tasha and their resistance movement. When she was in her father's house--which has been taken over by a thoughtless, uncaring dictator, just like the kingdom--my heart was pounding. This is a terrific adventure story, full of hope and all the right ingredients--READ IT!	2000-10-11

When Marius' little brother is born on Christmas Eve, the people in his 16th century French village are superstitious that Jean-Pierre is a loup-garou, a werewolf. This well-researched book relays so much detail about everyday life in a village 400 years ago that it's hard to believe Casanova wasn't there! However, it's the characters who make the book come alive. Marius, his father, Madame Troubene, Brother Gabriel (I hope we hear more about him in another book), the reprehensible Abbott, the all-too-believable butcher . . . these are memorable characters. And what a marvelous hero Marius is. I couldn't put this book down until I had finished it.	2000-10-11

This is an excellent book to share with children who are dealing with grief, whether it's for a grandparent, any friend or member of their family, or even a pet. Haynes' simple yet evocative text, and his soft drawings, present a gentle, moving story of a grandmother who takes time to say goodbye to everything she loves after she has died and before she goes to live in the stars. Librarians and teachers will welcome this book, recommending it to families with young children who are trying to cope with a death in their family.	2000-10-11

The author's illustrations, particularly the ethereal Grandma, are perfect for this book.	2000-09-28

This book was so evocative of my memories of Fourth of July celebrations  in my hometown in Wisconsin. From sparklers to grand fireworks, from wagons  to parades, from wiggling jello to yummy picnic fare, this book is  populated by a never-ending family--it's wonderful, joyous reading. And the  ending gives me shivers each time I read it--thank you Marsha Wilson Chall  for putting my memories into words.	2000-08-08

The inspiring nuggets of information in Catherine Thimmesh's book have my mind racing--do I have an invention lurking somewhere inside of me? The author's concise, information-packed, yet fun narrative will intrigue  children and adults alike, many of whom will turn page after page saying,  &quot;I never knew that!&quot; Judging from the chronology of inventions on  the endpapers, Ms. Thimmesh has many more stories to tell, and I can't wait  to read them. Melissa Sweet's collage illustrations are the perfect  complement, fascinating in their detail and ingenious in the textures and  materials she chooses. I've already bought several copies of this book; one  to keep and others to give as gifts. I can think of many children who will  pore over this book with great interest.	2000-04-13

I'm sure many of us share that special memory  place. It was a delight to learn that Roxaboxen was a real place, and to  discover the stories of the children who played there. The author does such  a good job of relating this &quot;story behind the story&quot; that one can  feel the summer sand and sense the Arizona winds. The photos and design of  the book enhance this experience, as does the special journal tucked inside  the book. Thanks to Alice McLerran for sharing her family's story with us  in this very special way.	2000-03-25
