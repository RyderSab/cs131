I read WISH YOU WERE HERE because Douglas Adams (DNA) is one of my favorite authors and I feel that his death is a tremendous loss to the art of the written word.  But unlike most his devoted readers, my favorite DNA novel is THE LONG DARK TEA TIME OF THE SOUL.  I have read it more times than I can count.  Why?<br /><br />During my life as student, I was compelled to study systems theory.  The systems theory developers have a very long tradition of being terrible writers - making systems theory much more complex than it should be.  I struggled though reading Parsons, Pinus and Minihan - among many others.  When I became a college professor, I did my best to clarify systems theory to my students.  It was at that time; I read THE LONG DARK TEA TIME OF THE SOUL and learned that Dirk Gently employs an ecological systems model in his search for the truth.  I had an epiphany.  My mind became clear and I was able to explain systems theory in a coherent manner.  DNAs' language and application of this theoretical framework enabled me to become a more effective professor.  In the early days of email (circa 1987-89), I emailed DNA to explain how I was employing his novel in the classroom.  I was absolutely shocked.  He replied to me and wanted more information.  His email was a real thrill!<br /><br />Webb does a excellent job of drawing a picture of the creator of Dirk Gently, Ford Prefect, and Zaphod Beeblebrox (among others).  I enjoyed and was quite surprised to learn about Adams' approach to writing.  As a reader, his writing appears to be an effortless joy, but he struggled to write.  The effect of his father on his writing and lifestyle was both intriguing and insightful.  The reader will immediately recognize the admiration that Webb has for Adams and become acutely aware of the pain the author feels with Adams' departure.  I deeply miss him also.<br /><br />Lastly, I fear that the publisher is doing a very poor job of marketing it.  I only learned about WISH YOU WERE HERE because it was given to me as a gift.  I hope that Amazon will use their data base to let SF readers know about this fine biography.ublisher is doing a very poor job of marketing it.

My 10 year old daughter has an interest in the history of the American Revolution.  As a result, I purchased BRAIN JUICE AMERICAN HISTORY FRESH SQUEEZED.  To pass the time on a plane ride, I started reading some of the poems to her.  After I stopped, she started asking questions like, \\"Who is FDR?\\"  \\"What do CCC and WPA stand for?\\"  She wanted to know more about the Great Depression and how the stock market works.  BRAIN JUICE opened the flood gates of questions and learning under the guise of playtime.<br /><br />I suspect that BRAIN JUICE would be a wonderful tool for history teachers.  The poems will get students to ask questions and learn about history in a painless manner.  I hope the Shields will do the same thing for science.	2005-07-01

As the title suggests, this is a story of a professional assassin; yet, I am not sure that \\"assassin\\" is the best word to use here. It sounds too harsh!  Nevertheless, the novel is not what I expected and there are two helpful points I can make.<br /><br />First, HIT MAN seems to be plotless.  Normally, one would think that a plotless novel would lack the richness to keep a person interested.  However, Block's writing skills maintains the reader's focus.  In many ways, HIT MAN is a series of interconnected short stories.  The progressive character development of the central figure, John Keller, is what keeps the reader turning the pages.  We observe him facing wide range of problematic situations - including ethical dilemmas (?).  The reader does not enter the mind of John Keller, but is able to witnesses the outcome of his critical thinking skills when he carries out his deadly tasks.<br /><br />Second, at least for me, the indication of an exceptionally good story is founded on the author's ability to create pictures in the reader's mind.  Some authors write with such vividness, they can induce readers to forget they're holding a book.  The reader leaves his/her body to become a witness of the events of the novel.  It is a feeling similar to watching a film, but more powerful.  That's the sign of an outstanding fiction author.  Block has this special gift of writing.<br /><br />Although, it ends abruptly, I recommend this book.	2005-05-31

When I first picked up the volume, I had two immediate reactions.  First, I was surprised by the size.  It is a short book (67 pages) and very small in physical size.  In academic circles, it would be classified as an essay - the length one normally would find in a scholarly journal.  However, I doubt that any philosophical journal would publish it.  On the other hand, if this essay were published in a scholarly journal, the general public would not have had an opportunity to read it.  Currently the book is a best-seller for the publisher!<br /><br />Second, it was a hoot to realize that a philosopher/scholar would give serious attention to the investigation of this phenomenon.  I stress the term \\"phenomenon\\" because my initial impression was that this essay focused on etymology.  It does not.  It is a philosophical essay grappling with essence.  So, don't let the title fool you.  The writing is serious and not superficial, but one cannot help but smile or even giggle while reading it.<br /><br />While reading the essay, I attempted to discover the \\"phenomenon\\" in the book itself.  I found a passage that seemed to illustrate that Frankfurt was guilty of employing the \\"phenomenon.\\"  However, I failed to underline it.  When I returned to find the passage, I had no luck.  I read the entire essay three times and couldn't identify an example of the book's content.  The exercise brought greater creditability to the content of the book!<br /><br />Excellent job of practical philosophy!  I hope that Frankfurt makes a bunch of money off of his effort!	2005-05-29

Although I do not have the words to describe my meaning, I can say that there is something different about hearing historical content on a recording when compared to reading the same content within the pages of a biography.  As a result, I was delighted to receive this CD as a gift when I was visiting Ohio.  I listened to it on the 11-hour drive home.  I can say two things about this CD.<br /><br />First, I learned a number of technical details regarding Zappa's guitar playing that I had not heard elsewhere.  He comments on many behind the scenes events which cannot be found in other sources.  In addition, he provides insight into his family life with focus on his children and Gail's last pregnancy.  I found Zappa's tone utterly fascinating.<br /><br />Second, Zappa would be absolutely outraged with the quality of the reproduction.  The CD includes (at least mine does) a great deal of hissing.  At times the hissing was so bad; it was difficult to hear the conversation.  The interviewer was inept and quite clumsy.  At one time, he seemed to have lost sight in the interview and there was a surprising amount of silence (or hissing).  At that point, Zappa jumps in and starts talking on this own.  Other times, the interview seemed very stilted - like the interviewer was doing a poor job of reading the questions to Zappa.  My hypothesis?  The interviewer had to be doing drugs.<br /><br />I think Zappa fans would enjoy the interview, but hate the hissing.  I'm glad I own it.	2005-05-23

Most of these books are exceptionally well written enabling the reader to be pulled into the world of the novel.<br /><br />In examining Grisham's work, one finds a \\"redemption\\" theme in most of them. On an NPR radio interview, Grisham discusses his joy of writing about  redemption and how his wife has been encouraging him to find an alternative theme.  In my untrained literary eye, I feel that his novels that lack this theme are visually limited.  That is, these novels lack the capacity to induce rich pictures in my mind.  In addition, redemption, in and of itself, does not necessarily mean that the main character is going to triumph or be enriched. THE PARTNER and THE KING OF TORTS are excellent examples.  Thus, the history of how Grisham handles redemption does not mean that the central sympathetic character is going to emerge prevailing or even surviving.<br /><br />While reading toward the end, those who are most familiar with Grisham's plot style will be acutely aware that there will be a variety of alternative endings to this novel.  I suspect that readers new to Grisham's style will be able to accurately predict the outcome.  Regardless of one's experience with Grisham, virtually all readers will find themselves sitting on the edge of their chairs as Joel Backman evades his diverse pursuers.<br /><br />There are two personal key points about the locations within THE BROKER. First, my family's origin is Northern Italy.  THE BROKER is the only piece of fiction that notes this geographic area.  In addition, the novel includes one of my favorite towns in the world -- Culpeper, Virginia.  How can I not like a book that includes these locations?cludes these locations? <br />	2005-03-27

THE LIONS' GAME offers the personality development necessary for understanding the social and psychological dynamics among the main characters.  Revisitation of a key character will make no sense without understanding the events in the THE LIONS' GAME.  In addition, reading the THE LIONS' GAME will offer a steamy plot alternative that includes Asad Khalil, the anti-hero.  In other words, reading the THE LIONS' GAME first will make the twists and turns within NIGHT FALL much more complex, compelling and nerve racking.<br /><br />This is my second DeMille novel.  I found THE LIONS' GAME so compelling that I had no alternative but to read a second novel.  Unlike THE LIONS' GAME, NIGHT FALL is written in the first person and through the eyes of the main character and hero, John Corey.  This style kept the reader in Corey's mind which was in a constant state of wavering suspicion.  A reader will move between seeing John Corey, a man who seeks justice; to John Corey, the man who wastes limited resources.  This constant process of bouncing between two different realities places the reader on the edge of the chair.  One radio commentator said the book made her sweat. Me too!<br /><br />The ending of the novel can best be described as anticlimactic.  According to a radio interview, the novel was written without an ending.  DeMille didn't know how to resolve the conflicting information that Corey had accumulated.  Eventually, DeMille's son offered a suggestion that would keep everyone guessing.  I suspect that most readers will be able to accurately guess the ending as soon as Corey establishes the meeting place.  Nevertheless, the lack of surprise does not spoil the novel.  I, for one, will seek out another DeMille novel.	2005-03-20

When I carry THE INTIMATE WORLD OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN with me, people comment on the book's content and express their opinion.  However, I discover that few of these people have actually read the book!  Clearly, this is a controversial book that generated a great deal of TV talk, but the talk lacks substance.  Mostly frustratingly, people will draw conclusion regarding the validity of Tripp's position without reading the book.  Thus, my first recommendation is to read the book and assess Tripp's methodology.  Don't buy the TV talk.<br /><br />Tripp (deceased just prior to publication), a well known clinical psychologist, has hypothesized that Lincoln was not a heterosexual.  This is considerably different from stating that Lincoln was a homosexual - which is how people who haven't read the book (i.e., Bill O'Reilly) interpret Tripp's findings.  Besides failing to read the book, many people lack the biological, historical and sociological background to understand Tripp's findings.  Here is where a solid liberal arts education pays off and perhaps herein lays the major criticism of Tripp's work.  Tripp fails to build the biological, historical and sociological foundation that provides the legitimacy for Tripp's conclusions.<br /><br />I can give examples of critical foundation issues that Tripp failed to address.  First, he needed to review the function of genes in human biology.  Many people with limited knowledge believe that genes provide discrete and clear cut outcomes - male/female; blue eyes/brown eyes.  Many genes don't function in this manner.  This biological tidbit has profound implications for sexual orientation.<br /><br />Second, Tripp needed to address the fundamentals of linguistic and sociological theory regarding the consequences for NOT having the term \\"homosexual\\" during Lincoln's life span.  \\"Homosexuality\\" as a social science concept didn't exist until after Lincoln's assassination.  The sociological and linguistic implications are profound and would have an impact on Lincoln's sexual activities.<br /><br />Third, he failed to address statistical theory.  Forty-two (42) men were presidents.  According to the current state of the art for estimating homosexuality among men, every 10th man is homosexual.  Thus, employing the central limit theorem, our best estimate includes the notion that less than 4.2 of our Presidents have homosexuality tendencies.  So, who are the gay presidents?<br /><br />The major contribution of Tripp's work is that he forces us to realize \\"so what!\\"  If Lincoln was gay, it doesn't change anything.  Nevertheless, Tripp's work is an excellent exercise of one' critical thinking skills.t on Lincoln's sexual activities.      Third, he failed to address statistical theory.

His writing style kept me on the edge of my chair and at times I started to sweat from the suspense.  It's very easy to get lost this novel.  Reading THE LION'S GAME was like watching a film in my mind.  I have often wondered what techniques authors employ to induce readers to become intensely drawn into the world of their novels.  I don't have the answer, but believe I am on the trail of focusing a few particular writing skills.  Two aspects of DeMille's writing are noteworthy.<br /><br />First, throughout the novel, DeMille is able to seamlessly move from first person pronouns (the hero, John Corey) to third person pronouns.  Later, he manages to employ the same skill with Asad Khalil, the anti-hero.  In particular, I found the phone conversation between the two men nothing less than fascinating.  It was written in the first person for both hero and anti hero.  What emerged was a life-like conversation - pictures in the mind.  Due to DeMille's skill of moving from first to third person, he was able to create a vivid picture of both characters' motivations.  Good and evil in this novel is not black and white, it is grey.  DeMille's writing skills, particularly his seamless ability to switch from first to third person pronouns, creates realism to his characters that we rarely witness in novels.<br /><br />Second, the capacity to make implausible situations plausible is another important skill.  A 747 jumbo jet independently and successfully lands at New York's JFK airport with the entire crew and all passengers dead - except for Asad Khalil.  To me with no technological knowledge of commercial jet travel, I accepted the idea.  Yes, although implausible, DeMille had me believing that jets can successful land without a pilot at the helm.  I remained lost in the pages of this book until the scene where Asad had cornered Corey and Kate behind a small boulder.  As a sniper, Asad employed a silencer and a telescopic lens, but Corey and Kate elected NOT return gunfire.  They feared that upon hearing their gun shots, the Secret Service agents would enter the situation thereby giving Asad additional targets.  At that point, the novel stopped creating pictures in my head - the implausible didn't plausible.  In my mind, by returning gunfire the Secret Service would be able to identify Asad's location and take him out.  In fact this scene forced me to stop reading.  With great frustration, I describe the scenario to a retired Special Forces sniper who later was part of a SWAT team. He informed me that the actions of Corey and Kate were common procedure under such peculiar circumstances.  Well - DeMille does his homework and I was able to finish this grand book.  What I thought was implausible was common.<br /><br />I found the end quite unnerving, but had a rare kind of realism that infrequently appears in such novels.  I am hoping that DeMille will bring back Asad and Corey for a final showdown.  Yet, I doubt this will happen - too implausible.<br /><br />I still don't have the answer to my question, \\"what makes an author create pictures in the mind of the reader?\\"  But - I do know that DeMille has this rare skill and I will continue to read his work.sniper, Asad employed a silencer and a telescopic lens, but Corey and Kate elected NOT return gunfire.

These include: THE MEDITERRANEAN CAPER, ICEBERG, RAISE THE TITANIC!, VIXEN 03, NIGHT PROBE, PACIFIC VORTEX, DEEP SIX, CYCLOPS, TREASURE, DRAGON, SAHARA, INCA GOLD, SHOCK WAVE, FLOOD TIDE, ATLANTIS FOUND, VALHALLA RISING and BLACK WIND.  I also read three novels he coauthored with Paul Kemprecos which include: SERPENT, BLUE GOLD, and FIRE ICE.  In addition, I read THE GOLDEN BUDDHA coauthored by Craig Dirgo.  His most recent novels (particularly the ones he coauthored) fail to meet the richness found in his earlier work.  I was particularly disappointed with GOLDEN BUDDHA and, as a result, I vowed never to waste my time reading another Cussler novel.  So, I lied.  After my GOLDEN BUDDHA vow, I received BLACK WIND as a Christmas gift and felt obligated to read it.  I am glad I did.<br /><br />In BLACK WIND, not only does Cussler return to the Dirk Pitt series, but also to an improved plot.  Reading a good story makes my mind travel; I forget about my surroundings and get lost watching the vividly described characters.  It has been awhile since Cussler has been able to do this.  In addition, we see the culmination of character development since his first Pitt novel was published (MEDITERRANEAN CAPER, 1973).  Through his 17 novels, Cussler paints a maturing picture of Pitt.  In BLACK WIND, Pitt becomes a man too old to continue to save the universe.  Enter Summer and Dirk Pitt, Jr.  They are the new generation of problem-solvers who inherited their father's wit and daring.<br /><br />Pitt senior is still around and active, but shares the adventures with his daughter and son.  Here, Cussler is able to produce a rare literary symmetry that most author cannot.  In a slow calculated manner, Pitt senior is passing the torch.  The entire Dirk Pitt series infuses a well thought-out character development that we see unfold over four decades (starting in 1973).  Like Dr. Who, Dirk Pitt is maturing out.  Unlike Dr. Who, Pitt doesn't have seven regenerations of himself, but Pitt does have two adult children who carry on the storyline and his genes - even if Cussler allows Pitt senior to die of old age, the storyline will continue (just like Dr. Who).<br /><br />One point must be stressed about Cussler's writing style.  Everyone who reads Cussler knows how the novel is going to end.  It is identical to knowing that James Bond will triumph.  We don't read Dirk Pitt novels (or James Bond) for the surprise ending but rather the twists, turns, and the imaginative encounters.  Cussler's skill with the pen is able to make an implausible situation plausible.  The \\"implausible/plausible\\" storyline is what makes Dirk Pitt series worth reading.  With this thought as my guide, I'll continue to read the Pitt novels.out.

There are no words in the English language to describe my distain for this assignment.  In my sophomore year, I was required to read HAMLET.  I vividly remember saying, \\"I'd rather someone rip out my kidney.\\"  In my junior year, I was required to read MACBETH.  It was then I decided that I could not let Shakespeare destroy my life by subjecting me to another failing grade.  In contemporary language, I handled it like a counterphobia, I read MACBETH five times.  By the third time, I understood Shakespearian English.  By the fourth time, I clearly understood the plot.  By the fifth time, I found myself enjoying the play.  I conquered Shakespeare! -- but it took me longer than my classmates.  During my senior year without being required, I read five plays:<br /><br />ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL<br /><br />THE TAMING OF THE SHREW<br /><br />MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING<br /><br />A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM<br /><br />THE TWO GENTLEMENT OF VERONA<br /><br />Because I read MACBETH five times, I understood and appreciated the artistry within these comedies.  I couldn't understand why we (high school students) were required to read the tragedies rather than the more palatable comedies.  During my freshman year in college, I wrote a term paper: a biography of Shakespeare.  I was stunned to learn that scholars knew very little about his life.  The paper had to be at least 10 pages long, mine was 11, but 2 1/2 pages included pictures of buildings (used for filler to comply with the course requirement).  With this background, the few who read this review can understand how someone like ME would read such a high brow book like WILL IN THE WORLD.  I simply wanted to follow-up on my term paper and to learn if it was Shakespeare's intent to torture high school students.  I read WILL IN THE WORLD because I thought Greenblatt might have some answers.<br /><br />I was introduced to WILL IN THE WORLD on C-Span's BOOKNOTES.  Two general points emerged in my head.<br /><br />First, Greenblatt writes in the same manner a social worker would write an assessment of a troubled client.  Social workers analyze a client's environment (work life, family relationships, neighborhood, etc) then draws inferences about the person.  Greenblatt examines the historical circumstances and anthropological findings then draws inferences about Shakespeare.  Actually, social science research has demonstrated a considerable amount of validity by employing this technique.  Here, Greenblatt does an excellent job, but he lacks a critical dimension of what social workers always include in such an analysis - psychological theory.  Greenblatt would have offered greater insight into Shakespeare's youth if he had incorporated developmental theories such as Piaget's framework for cognitive development.  Here, he could have hypothesized the developmental process of Shakespeare's capacity to write at a young age.  In addition, by employing Sternberg's theory of love relationships, Greenblatt could offer a more vivid description of the relationship dynamics between William and Anne.  Clearly, psychological theory is absent from Greenblatt's work.<br /><br />Second, the photo of Greenblatt in WILL IN THE WORLD hints that the author is pompous and arrogant.  However, within the hour interview on BOOKNOTES, he seemed like an earthy guy who hated reading Shakespeare in high school.  He projected the image of being humble and wanting to write a book for the general public to facilitate an understanding of Shakespeare as a person, thereby creating an atmosphere of greater esthetic appreciation for Shakespearian literature.  I think his interviewed succeeded in this goal, but not his book.  There are too many 25 cent words.  Too much goes unexplained.  People who walk in sneakers will not be able to finish his book!  Mmmmm, but I wear sneakers and I completed his book.<br /><br />In the end, one critical and serious issue is left unaddressed.  I was forced (very much against my will) to read Shakespeare in high school.  I dearly hated it.  Yet, I now can say that Shakespeare's plays have deeply enriched my life.  If I wasn't forced to read Shakespeare, I would be a different person - and I think - less of a person.  As professors and teachers, we often create course material that students \\"like\\" rather than the rigorous or painful material that has a long term benefit. Educators, in fact, are dumbing down courses to appeal to students.  Sadly, I see many colleges dropping the Shakespeare requirement because he's a white European male with little relevance to our technologically advanced society.  Forcing students to read Shakespeare is not a bad thing.  Greenblatt's book has reopened my eyes to the richness and importance of Shakespeare.  That alone makes WILL IN THE WORLD an excellent book.the end, one critical and serious issue is left unaddressed.   I was forced (very much against my will) to read Shakespeare in high school.

His most recent novels (particularly the ones he coauthored) fail to meet the richness found in his earlier work.  In a long process of excruciating reflection, I have drawn three conclusions regarding GOLDEN BUDDHA (coauthored with Craig Dirgo) that focus on changes in my personal enjoyment of Cussler's recent collaborative writing.<br /><br />First is intensive character development.  Within Cussler's Dirk Pitt series, I gained a great deal of reading enjoyment by viewing the character development.  He was able to offer his readers an intensive psychological profile of the main and secondary characters.  This process made the characters come alive by having an in depth understanding of their individual and often conflicting motivations.  In addition, Cussler was able to move the characters through their aging cycles and thereby produced changes within their psychological profiles.  I don't see this intensive character development in GOLDEN BUDDHA or in the other novels Cussler has coauthored.  I miss that aspect of this writing.<br /><br />Throughout the Dirk Pitt series, the impossible seemed possible.  Cussler was able to pull together a series of strange and twisted elements within a story.  These plot twists and turns emerged from the character's thought processes, dialog, and the reader's knowledge of history and archeology.  Within GOLDEN BUDDHA, the characters do very little thinking.  They merely heave money at problems.  For example, I became annoyed with the sewage system used to transport the Buddha.  I don't consider myself particularly creative, but I immediately thought of a more efficient, cheaper, and much less hazardous mode of transit.  Dirk Pitt used his head to problem-solve.  The characters in GOLDEN BUDDHA merely purchased stuff and staff to achieve goals.  I want to read about a character's action, not his use of nearly unlimited financial resources.<br /><br />In Cussler's earlier work, there was always a surprise element.  This is not to suggest that the endings were a surprise but the process to get to the preordained happy ending was nerve-racking.  The description of the escape from the Cuban prison in GOLDEN BUDDHA had me sitting on the edge of my chair, but it lacked the intellectual initiative.  In addition, it demonstrated that the future challenges within the storyline were going to be solved financially rather than intellectually.  Thus, when one reads the description of the Cuban prison escape in GOLDEN BUDDHA, the process for all the other tense moments become anticlimactic.

My gerontology students and I were impressed with the number of techniques, but the real strength of this book lies in the wonderful examples of how these group work techniques can be employed.  My students, in particular, liked the concepts of bibliotherapy and humor therapy.  The general weakness, which is found in most writings on intervention for the elderly, there is little to no discussion on counterindications.  We commonly see a discussion on counterindications for other age cohorts, but rarely for elderly groups.  Ageism?  I suspect that chapters 13 (Managed Payment Systems) and 14 (Alternative Funding for Elderly Groups) were outdated prior to the book going to press.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an excellent book.	2004-11-21

TRACE is the fifth in a series of Kay Scarpetta novels following POINT OF ORIGIN, BLACK NOTICE, THE LAST PRECINCT, and BLOW FLY (in that order).  I purchased an advanced copy of TRACE because BLOW FLY ended abruptly.  I wanted to find out \\"what happens next.\\"  Without destroying the storyline of BLOW FLY, I can say that Cornwell is clear about what happens to Jay Talley and Bev, but not the central character, Jean Baptiste Chandonne.  What happened to him!!!?  Because BLOW FLY ends so abruptly, I suspected that I would learn more about Jean Baptiste Chandonne in TRACE.  However, I found TRACE to be frustrating because Chandonne doesn't reappear.  For me, that's a problem.  However, TRACE is still a good story.<br /><br />Details of autopsy procedures and the mechanics of flying a helicopter demonstrate Cornwell attention to details and the level of in depth research she pursues in telling a story.  In addition, Cornwell is crafty in her use of the English language. She is able to play on the emotions of her readers. She has the rare skill of inducing discomfort in her readers' minds.  She remains a talented writer.<br /><br />Although I find myself a bit frustrated about the Jean Baptiste Chandonne storyline, I look forward to the next novel.  It wouldn't surprise me if Jean Baptiste Chandonne reappeared stronger and more cunning than ever in a future novel.	2004-11-07
US	51662980	R2V3TI422PMBOP	0440242002	430694437	Bleachers	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Tuesdays with Rake	I have read ALL of Grisham's works -- even before he was well known. I have never read anything of Grisham that I disliked.  Of all these novels, there are several that harsh critics commonly call \\"non-Grisham novels.\\"  These \\"non-Grisham\\" novels include: A PAINTED HOUSE, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, THE LAST JUROR and now BLEACHERS.  They're called non-Grisham novels because they do NOT include a lawyer confronting redemption.  When some booklovers anticipate reading about a lawyer caught in an unexpected state of affairs with intrigue and deception, they turn each page waiting for the lawyer to show up and become extremely disappointed when he doesn't appear.  Thus, if you want to read a lawyer's story, you'll be disappointed with BLEACHERS.  BLEACHERS is more like TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE than Grisham's expected storyline.<br /><br />TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE?  Yes.  In fact, Grisham could have entitled it, TUESDAYS WITH EDDIE RAKE WITH AN EDGE.  Eddie Rake, the small town football coach who is a combination of Woody Hayes and Vince Lombardi, is dying.  The most unique aspect of this novel is the character development of Eddie Rake.  Employing a writing style that Grisham has never used, the development of Eddie Rake's character emerges from the actions and talk of those who are mourning and/or waiting for his death.  I suspect that the successful employment of this technique for developing a character was an extremely difficult task.  I imagine that Grisham had to do many rewrites to get the story to sound right.  Using this technique, the reader learns from second-hand sources that Rake is a man with a powerful and intense influence on those around him - even a gay football player.  The novel unfolds with a series of stories of how Rake motivated those around him.<br /><br />Those who read BLEACHERS will find themselves taking a mental journey back to their high school days.  It doesn't make any difference if you were on the team, the players and coach had influence.  For me, I recall an English course in which a burly football player was disrupting the class.  Since the teacher was an assistant football coach, he laughed, but we all knew that if anyone else attempted those antics, it would be the end.  At mid term, the students were asked to complete a course evaluation.  I organized several students to criticize the teacher/coach for his football player bias.  The next time the football player acted out, he was shocked by the social crucifixion he received.  Star football players expect special treatment and according to Grisham need it because the rest of their lives move downhill.  For bringing back this memory, BLEACHERS gets an additional star from me.<br /><br />With no doubt in my mind, this is Grisham's best non-Grisham novel.ence.

When I began to explain who Frank Zappa was, I was struck by the fact that numerous books have been written about or by Zappa.

In many ways, it seems like I am not reading a book about the same person.  Each of these authors sees Zappa through their personalized lens.  Courrier presentation is different from the others because he offers details of the environment surrounding virtually every composition.  Since his book is one of the later publications on the list above, he often quotes and/or cites from the other works.  Interesting, I didn't get the feeling of reading the same information as I have read in the other works.<br /><br />I liked DANGEROUS KITCHEN: THE SUBVERSIVE WORLD OF ZAPPA.

BEING FRANK: MY TIME WITH FRANK ZAPPA by Nigery Lennon<br /><br />When I purchased MY BROTHER WAS A MOTHER from Amazon, I thought the theme was a cute idea -- until I read the Preface.  The Preface made the entire enterprise sound uncomfortably exploitive.  I was particularly distressed when I noticed that Nigey Lennon wrote the Forward.  I disliked her book entitled, BEING FRANK.  I was deeply offended by Lennon's portrayal of Frank Zappa, and as a result didn't write a review of it.  I feared that MY BROTHER WAS A MOTHER was going down the same path.  Fortunately, it didn't.<br /><br />I brought MY BROTHER WAS A MOTHER to keep my mind occupied on a plane trip from Lumberton, NC to Washington, DC via Charlotte, NC.  I was able to complete the entire book (87 pages) within the Lumberon/Charlotte leg (20 to 30 minutes).  Thus, this book isn't long enough to be a good plane book.  Regardless, I genuinely enjoyed it.<br /><br />MY BROTHER WAS A MOTHER offers some insight that others book about Frank Zappa do not.  For example, I was intensely interested in reading about the conflictual relationship between son and father.  Most of us who were reared in the 60's had the same experience with our parents. In one particular circumstance, Candy didn't offer adequate details.  Rock history records Frank's arrest for producing an adult film.  His dad bailed him out of jail.  I wish that Candy would have developed a deeper insight into the dynamics of the father/son relationship.  In the book she describes the contempt for each had for the other, but when the rubber hits the road, a good dad will come to the aid of his son.  Later, the son will come to the aid of his dad.

I have read most (or all that I could find) of Cornwell's novels and have noticed that her recent work has lost the intensity that could readily be found in earlier novels.  Several of years ago, Cornwell switched her main character from Kay Scarpetta to Judy Hammer.  The Hammer novels did not have the rich characters found in the Scarpetta series.  For this and other reasons, I was delighted to see BLOW FLY published.<br /><br />BLOW FLY is the fourth novel in a series following POINT OF ORIGIN, BLACK NOTICE and THE LAST PRECINCT (respectively).  After completing THE LAST PRECINCT, I knew that Cornwell would have to write a fourth novel.  KEY POINT: People who have not read or recall all the details of POINT OF ORIGIN, BLACK NOTICE, and THE LAST PRECINCT will be totally lost.  In fact, I want to skim these earlier novels to refresh my memory to better understand BLOW FLY.  One of the harsh criticism directed toward THE LAST PRECINCT is the 70 (or so) pages of psychotherapy between Kay and Anna.  I found the dialog particularly annoying.  However, after reading BLOW FLY, I now understand Kay's need for psychotherapy.  She has been hornswoggled by those closest to her (including Lucy, Marino and a totally unexpected character from one of the previous novels).  I suspect that she'll be receiving more psychotherapy in the fourth novel which I believe will be entitled TRACE.  Yes, BLOW FLY ends very abruptly, in fact, more abruptly than any other novel I have read.<br /><br />In BLOW FLY, Cornwell sees no need for character development.  All the main characters (both good and evil) are well-known from past works.  Thus, for readers who are intimately acquainted with the characters will see their bizarre actions consistent and well within the realm of reasonable behavior.  Those who haven't read the past three novels will be totally lost because the actions of the characters will be beyond explanation and logic.  The actions of the characters will be so far removed from reality, the novel cannot be enjoyed.  One has to know the characters to appreciate BLOW FLY.<br /><br />Cornwell is crafty in her use of the English language.  She is able to play on the emotions of her readers.

In addition, I failed to read any of the book reviews (like I usually do) until after completing it.  I'm glad I waited because if I did, I wouldn't have read this fairy tale.  I found many of the reviews overly negative.  However, I understand why.  Readers who have experienced \\"competitive\\" publishing would have a deep appreciation for the nuances and symbols within Kotzwinkle's work.  I can easily see how readers without such an experience would find THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN too quirky at best -- and too stupid at worst.<br /><br />As I was reading the description of how Hal Jam acquired his first manuscript, I began to think of a particular faculty member that has remained a tenured assistant professor for well over 10 years.  He's never been able to write or conduct research independently.  As it often goes, one thought leads to another.  I recall that during my own mentoring, senior faculty would constantly warn me to beware of sharing my ideas and work with other faculty.  Although I am a full professor, the ideas presented to me all those years ago didn't click until after I read THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN.  Now I am conceptualizing assistant and associate professors as bears or non bears.  I have concluded that I am in a department with at least one bear.<br /><br />A good novel has the capacity to induce a reader to rethink or broaden one's life situation.  To put it in another way -- to see old or familiar experiences within a new light (a paradigm shift).  For professors, THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN offers a fresh perspective for an everyday event.	2004-07-25

I have never read anything of Grisham that I disliked. As a result, I decided to read THE LAST JUROR while being subjected to rehabilitation therapy for my injured back. I was experiencing a great deal of physical pain but Grisham's novel was able to draw my attention away from my personal problems. It moved my mind from my location at the physical therapy center and had me travel to Ford County, Mississippi. Mind movement is the highest praise I can offer to a piece of fiction.<br /><br /> Grisham's novel came alive for me because his portrayal of Ford County Mississippi is similar to the small southern community where I live. The characters were lifelike and came alive. More importantly, many of them were quite similar to some quirky characters that I see in my everyday life. I think anyone living in a small southern town would enjoy this novel.<br /><br /> Immediately following the publication of THE KING OF TORTS, Grisham was interviewed on National Public Radio. Here, I learned that his wife was encouraging him to move his basic storyline away from the concept of redemption. I was saddened when I heard this because I thought this element was a refreshing characteristic for contemporary novels. When THE LAST JUROR arrived at my door, I immediately wondered if Grisham removed his redemption insight. I see the redemption theme in this novel but not with the great intensity of his past work. At any rate, THE LAST JUROR is worth reading.	2004-07-25

BEING FRANK: MY TIME WITH FRANK ZAPPA by Nigery Lennon<br />When I started reading FRANK ZAPPA: THE NEGATIVE DIALECTICS OF POODLE PLAY, I found myself having flashbacks to the days of my doctoral studies and to the philosophical debates emerging from the 60's liberation movement.  While a Ph.D. student I studied Postmodernism, Feminism, Liberation Philosophers, etc.  You know, all the stuff you'd think would have no application outside of graduate study.  As a result, I was fascinated because reading this book was the first time I had to actually reflect back to the philosophies I studied.  I actually found myself reading POODLE PLAY in the manner that I read my required readings as a Ph.D student.  I checked and read some of the citations; I searched for more information on topics for which I was unfamiliar (i.e.,\\" Situational International\\"); I discussed major themes and ideas with colleagues who were professors of economics, philosophy, sociology and political science.  After reading the several chapters, my first impression was that Watson's book was intellectually challenging - more challenging than any recent research I have been reading.<br />Two critical points can be made.  First, I was profoundly struck by Watson' critique of Feminist Theory within Zappa's work.  I never read such an analysis and found it refreshing.  I saw Zappa much more of a deep thinker and an intellectual giant.  Second, some of Watson's later analysis of Zappa's work seemed to be pushing the envelop to absurdity.  I began to see Watson as a pseudo intellectual particularly when he equated KING LEAR with Zappa's APOSTROPHE(').  Watson writes: \\"In 'Nanook Rubs It' Nonook blinds the fur trapper by rubbing his eyes with snow discoloured with ... [you know].  Blindness is also central to King Lear.\\"  (page 243).  I almost stopped reading.<br />Somehow I managed to continue to read and I'm glad that I did.  When I reached the epilogue, the entire book was made clear.  Here, Watson describes his meeting with Zappa and his wife, Gail, after they read the prepublished manuscript of POODLE PLAY.  At that time, Zappa had terminal cancer and the book made him laugh!  Clearly, this was Watson's intent for his book.  I finally got it!  In an attempt to define the humor found within, I spoke with Dr. Bowman who specializes in the study of humor and recreation.  Currently, there seems to be no formal label for Watson's brand of humor.  Bowman came to the conclusion that Watson's work can best be described as hyperbolic or benign fabrications - descriptive terms that were derived from the work of Erving Goffman.  Essentially, through a series of intellectual gyration, Watson takes classical literature (throughout the ages) and draws parallels with Zappa's work.  In many cases the linkages are fascinating, but other times they are absurd.  It is like a very good April Fools joke.  It is like tugging a barely fitting rubber band over the head of a jar.<br />The big question is how was Watson able to pull this off?  First, it is obvious that he studied philosophy and knows the subject matter.  Second, he intimately knows Zappa's work.  Third, Watson discovered reoccurring themes in the history of humanity.  Thus, the blindness we find in APOSTROPHE(') can be defined with the same symbolic value we see in King Lear.  Did Zappa create this deep symbolism in his lyrics?  Of course not!  Is there some kind of collective unconsciousness within humanity in which general themes for the understanding of the meaning of life continues to surface in a unique manner for each generation?  Well, that sounds like a theme for Watson's next book.manity.  Thus, the blindness we find in APOSTROPHE(') can be defined with the same symbolic value we see in King Lear.

As for TROJAN ODYSSEY, the best recommendation I can make is do NOT read it before VALHALLA RISING. The introduction of key characters in TROJAN ODYSSEY can be found on the last couple of pages of VALHALLA RISING. The introduction of these two new characters is a bit of a shock.  Thus, I cannot reveal who they are, but I can say that meeting them in VALHALLA RISING makes TROJAN ODYSSEY a great anticipation.<br />Without exception, Dirk Pitt has always been the source of the initial hypothesis for the cause of the earth shaking calamity about to erupt.  In this case, a computer beats Pitt to the punch.  As for me, I thought this was a sad commentary on plot development.  Following the thought processes of the hero is an extremely important component of my reading pleasure.  Thus in this novel, in the battle between man and machine, machine wins.  Although the hypotheses comes from the computer, Pitt is the one who develops the precise plan to save the earth, the European economy, and, of course, identify the true wrong doers.<br />In Cussler's past novels I have always found myself getting lost in the reading.  I traveled in my mind.  The TROJAN ODYSSEY did not share this characteristic with his other novels.  This is not to say that the story line is bad, the novel lacks that metaphysical quality and intensive writing style that makes me travel with my mind.<br />On the last couple of pages, Dirk is facing a gerontological crossroad.  He has to make a critical decision, but doesn't.  Clearly, Cussler will have Pitt make a decision at the beginning of an upcoming novel.  I feel sure I know the final decision (as most readers would); however, the implications for the decision are going to lead to a whole new series of twisted intrigue.	2004-01-26
US	51662980	RW8CNQ80ZNGJW	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Three recommendations	Prior to reading the DA VINCI CODE, I have three strong recommendations.  First, read Brown's DEMONS AND ANGELS.  In DEMONS AND ANGELS, Brown introduces the main character -- Robert Langston, the Harvard professor.  The reader will have clearer insight into Langston character develop. In fact, the DAVINCI CODE begins the day after DEMONS AND ANGELS ends.<br />Second, find a copy of the Mona Lisa on the Internet.  There is a URL that offers the contrast within the context of Brown's framework (da Vinci's smile/Mona Lisa's smile).  My friends who have read the DA VINCI CODE and have seen the constrast have developed a renewed appreciation for da Vinci's artistry.<br />Third, find a copy of the da Vinci's The Last Supper that enables you to enlarge it.  You'll need to revisit it several times while reading this great novel.  As a child, I have seen The Last Supper more times that I can count.  However, while reading THE DAVINCI CODE, I developed fresh perspective and a deeper appreciation for this masterpiece.<br />Like DEMONS AND ANGELS, THE DAVINCI CODE offers a series twists and turns that evolve into a series of difficult to predict outcomes.  The common question for this type of novel becomes, \\"who did it?\\"  The reader enters a struggle to uncover \\"who did it.\\" prior to the writer revealing the details.  I was totally taken off guard.  Brown is able to effectively distract the readerby bringing in a series of highly plausible evil doers.  In fact, reading DEMONS AND ANGELS first offers the basis for additional suspects.<br />The most thrilling aspect of this book is Brown's style.  Brown is a crafty writer who has the ability to take the reader to another place.  I was so absorbed, I lost track of time and forgot where I was.  Brown's vividness creates pictured in my mind -- making me forget that I am reading a book and creating the feeling that I am writing a great film.	2004-01-26

It is a bit more cerebral and thought provoking.<br />In variety of ways, MR. MAYBE shares many of the elements found in the HBO series, SEX IN THE CITY.  Of course, instead of New York, London is the backdrop.  In particular, MR. MAYBE shares three positive stylistic approaches that have made SEX IN THE CITY so trendy and fashionable.  First, we find a diary-like quality in these pages.  The Libby (the central character) is constantly asking herself probing questions about relationships.  Like SEX IN THE CITY, the answers to the questions emerge from the social interaction of the characters.  Second, the questions she asks herself and her close girlfriends are profound.  In a naive sort of way, Libby believes that she is the first person to question the motives and reasoning for getting married.  However, these questions and concerns internalized by Libby have been asked by young women and men for over a millennium. Third, Green has developed a seamless technique for character development.  Green has a rare quality of pressing the reader to understand the depths of each character's personality by social interaction with other characters and the intensity of the dialog.<br />Green clearly answers a critical question that plagues the mind of many young women.  Through the character of Libby, Green responds to the question, \\"Does a woman need to be married to be happy?\\"  MR MAYBE presents the struggle to come to terms with this question.  It sounds paradoxical, but MR MAYBE is light reading that offers profound insight.	2003-06-26

In contrast to his previous work, Sparks significantly changed his overarching theme for this most recent novel. THE GUARDIAN has a very different tone. Sparks was wise to institute such a change in his storyline. I think such an effort challenged his mind and made a superb reading experience.<br />Sparks is well-known for writing love stories that have a degree of realism but also pushes the envelop of mushiness. In THE GUARDIAN, Sparks writes a story of the affections between a man and a woman. As common in his other novels, we witness several emotional triangles. Sparks is quite skilled in painting a picture with words that illustrates the emotional trauma when a third party is thrown into an emotional tie between two others. What makes THE GUARDIAN different is the element of suspense and peril in which the major and minor characters (including a dog) are placed in life threatening situations.<br />More than any other other of his novels, THE GUARDIAN illustrates Sparks' talent for writing. He develops several layers of emotional complexity, without being incoherent, and retaining the reader's interest. In many respects, THE GUARDIAN maintains the same level of complexity as Raymond Chandler's THE BIG SLEEP. However, Sparks is able to do a much better job than Chandler in keeping the reader focused. In many ways, it is quite amazing that Sparks was able to hold this storyline together.<br />Frankly, I think that THE GUARDIAN is Sparks' best work.	2003-04-27

All of these are wonderfully written stories, but I think it is critically important that one reads RELIC first, followed by RELIQUARY and then THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.  I read THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES first and regretted it.  Perhaps we need a federal law requiring warning labels on such novels?<br />In RELIQUARY, all the main characters who survived in RELIC converge to uncover the hidden causal factors that explain their encounter in the museum.  As I stated in my review of RELIC, it ends with \\"a knock on the door.\\"  RELIQUARY does not begin by identifying who knocked on the door, but only toward the end of this second novel does it become clear who (or perhaps more accurately \\"what\\") knocked on the door.  For those of you who read this review, I hope I am able to convince you to read RELIC first.<br />Each time I read a novel by Preston and Child, I become more amazed that two authors are able to coordinate their efforts to write with such a penetrating style. The integration of science and technology provide a great backdrop.  In all of their books, I become so engaged in the storyline, I forget where I am.  I have gotten lost in all of their novels and am looking forward to finding another to read!	2003-04-19
US	51662980	R1HH4NO3LG60WY	0812543262	584815540	Relic (Pendergast, Book 1)	Books	5	122	130	N	Y	Made me sweat	I have read several works of Preston and Child.  I have read their works in the following order: THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, MOUNT DRAGON, and RELIC.  Currently, I am reading the follow-up to RELIC - a novel entitled, RELIQUARY.  I made one big mistake by reading Preston and Child's THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES prior to reading RELIC.  Some of the characters in THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES can be found in the RELIC.  If I explain the reasoning for my mistake, I will ruin the intrigue of the central plot of THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.  Thus, I will offer no explanation, but rather just ask you to trust me: read RELIC and RELIQUARY prior to reading THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.  RELIC ends with, \\"there is a knock on the door.\\"  This leads into the next novel RELIQUARY.<br />I cannot express my delight of reading Preston and Child.  There is an intensity of their writing that induces me to forget that I am reading a book.  When I am involved in reading their novels, my mind travels with the characters in the novel.  I find myself sweating and sitting on the edge of my chair.  Their writing is quite astonishing.  In addition, they bring in technology and the anthropological/biological sciences in a remarkable manner.  That last time I took a biology course was in the 70's.  Although I didn't believe this while I was in college, I certainly had a great biology professor.  I had to employ my basic of knowledge of biology to comprehend the storyline.  My biology course not a waste of time.<br />I will continue to read Preston and Child, but will make sure I'll read them in order of their publication dates.  I give you the same recommendation.	2003-04-06
US	51662980	R2W9P50H2YL0VI	0812564375	666062148	Mount Dragon	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Evil as Gray	I was given MOUNT DRAGON as a gift.  I read it because I thought CABINET OF CURIOSITIES (another novel by Preston and Child) was such a great reading experience.  Although MOUNT DRAGON lacks many of the qualities of CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, it is also an intense novel.  One initial thought: I don't understand how two authors can coordinate their skills and compose such a great stories.  In my experience, coauthoring is an extremely difficult task and often times the final product lacks lucidity.<br />The most artful characteristic of MOUNT DRAGON is the lifelike manner in which the authors are able to portray good and evil.  In real life, good and evil are not discrete entities, but rather they are a paradox existing within the shell of all of us.  Thus, Preston and Child portray good and evil as gray - neither black nor white.  Thus, we see redeeming qualities in all of the evil characters with the possible exception of one - Nye, the security director.  In addition, we see flaws within the \\"good\\" characters.  It is much easier to create characters who are obviously good or evil and extremely difficult to create realistic personalities that embrace both characteristics.  This complex writing task makes the novel suspenseful.  The reader doesn't have a clear view of the direction of at least two subplots (particularly after reading CABINET OF CURIOSITIES).  For example, the Scopes character is paradoxical, complex - thus, much less predictable, more interesting.  On the other hand, the actions of Nye were clear cut.  Readers will immediate catch his inherent evil and will be able to accurately predict his actions.<br />The best praise I can offer a novelist is that I will read his/her other work.  I was given a copy of Preston and Child's RELIQUARY to read.  However, when I read the cover, I realized it was the sequel to THE RELIC.  I'm looking forward to reading these novels.	2003-03-23
US	51662980	R2ZBYFRKHHE1Y6	0385508042	106527389	The King of Torts	Books	5	12	15	N	N	Letter of the law versus the spirit of the intent	I have read ALL of Grisham's works -- even before he was well known.  I usually like his storylines, but according to a National Public Radio interview, Grisham's wife is encouraging him to move his basic storyline away from the concept of \\"redemption.\\"  I hope he doesn't (I need some redemption in my life). Since I heard the interview prior to completing his book, I sensed the ending - and I was correct.  Yet, I don't think that people continue to read Grisham to get a surprise.  People continue to read Grisham because he is a master of the written word.  His words flow like a film and create pictures in one's mind.  Thus, the interview didn't damage my reading of his novel.<br />Without regard to the lack of a surprise ending, I immediately saw something extremely valuable in this novel.  As a college professor, I teach a policy course.  Policy courses are generally hated by students.  One policy concept I try teach is: \\"letter of the law versus the spirit of the intent.\\"  The central theme in the KING OF TORTS embraces this complex concept for which many of my students have difficulty in understanding.  In an effort to have students understand, I offered a brief outline of the KINGS OF TORTS (without destroying the story) and recommended they read it.  Here, tort lawyers comply with the letter of the law (perhaps some push the envelop a bit much), but it is clear that these lawyers do not embrace the spirit for which laws were designed to protect citizens against unscrupulous manufacturers.  Now, students understand what is meant by \\"letter of the law versus the spirit of the intent\\" without having to be punished by a lecture from me or the extremely dry writing from our textbook.<br />In the end, I like Grisham's writing and look forward to his next novel.	2003-03-05

Students are required to have a fundamental knowledge of biological systems.  Such knowledge is not the top priority of many students and oftentimes students have low motivation.  However, I suspect that when students are required to examine/review THE HUMAN BODY ATLAS as part of their closed reserve reading assignments, they will become more enthusiastic about understanding biological systems.<br />The illustrations are quite impressive.  Two points in particular are worth noting.  First, all the illustrations are artful and large.  Even the illustrations that extend over two pages have a high degree of clarity.  Technologically this is a complex task which would require the editor, publisher, and illustrators (31) to closely coordinate their efforts.  I suspect that they had to redo their work many times prior to getting the illustration to look just right.  Second, I have seen many such illustrative books on the human body.  THE HUMAN BODY ATLAS stands out because of its illustrations of the aging process.  Thus, besides being a great asset for a human behavior course, it is also worthy of being a closed reserve item for a gerontology course.<br />I highly recommend this book for undergraduate academic libraries.	2003-02-11
US	51662980	R96143BCLFZUA	0767907809	834442453	Bookends: A Novel	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Vivid Reading!	I took a chance on reading BOOKENDS because I read Green's JEMIMA J and found it to be light, thoughtfully written and most importantly amusing. Based on reading the dust cover, I thought that BOOKENDS was going to be less of a quality reading experience. I was certainly wrong. In fact, I would say that BOOKENDS has a much better storyline than JEMIMA J. Which just proves one more time, \\"you can't judge a book by its cover.\\" Several features make BOOKENDS a particularly good reading experience. I liked the character development, the vividness of the Green's written word and, of course, the unexpected plot conclusion.<br />Good character development requires a writer to have profound insight into human motivation. Green delineates past experiences of the characters in this novel to enable the reader to comprehend a variety of causes for each character's action. Green has the rare skill of offering the reader an in-depth appreciation and empathy for every character. She does this seamlessly and her skill appears to be effortless. As a professor, I can use this novel as an illustration of complex social science theory in the classroom. I am able to do this because of Green's understanding of human motivation and the richness of her composition. Over the years, I've discovered that teaching theory is much less dry to students when I employ examples of human behavior from a good novel.<br />The vividness of Green's writing skills makes each character come alive. Green's mastery of the written word transfers the reader to a different place. When one reads BOOKENDS, it is more like watching a film rather than reading a book. I don't believe one can offer a greater compliment to an author.<br />While being caught up in the vivid pictures Green created, I merely expected a thoughtful story. However, Green skillfully includes a couple of plot twists that took me off totally off guard. I wasn't expecting a surprise ending, but there it was. I laughed aloud! And everyone on the airplane heard me.airplane heard me.	2003-01-17

Normally I don't read this type of novel, but a friend gave me it to me.  Although he had not read THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, he highly recommended it on the basis of the authors' other novels.  I'm glad I read it.  The authors offer a number of interesting twists and turns -- some predictable, some not, but all intense.<br />With the exception of the first 10 pages and the last 3 pages, reading THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES can best be described as intense and unnerving.  In fact, the reading was SO unnerving, I found that I had to put the book down, walk nervously around the room, return to my reading to discover what would happen next.  I got lost in the book and forgot where I was.  Reading this novel was like watching a film rather than reading a book.  I was suppose to meet a group of friends for dinner, but became so immersed in the book; I lost track of time and missed my meal.<br />The elements of surprise are reminiscence of Hitchcock's PSYCHO.  There is no shower scene in THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, but there is an unexpected timing and unexpected victims of several murders.  For example, when one first sees PSYCHO, one does not expect Janet Leigh to be murdered -- so early in the film.  In addition, Hitchcock's shower scene offers such an unnerving and intense feeling because of the vulnerability and helplessness of the victim.  This same kind of intensity can be found in THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.<br />Although the violence is NOT gratuitous, if you offended by violence in a novel, don't read THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.  If, on the other hand, you get a thrill from an unnerving and intense escape from reality, you'll love THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.	2002-10-30

It caught my eye because of its color and picture on the cover.  It was not until then, I realized that Steve Martin wrote it.  After reading the reviewers' comments on the back cover - which I rarely believe - I purchased the book.  By the way, their comments were a quite accurate description of the storyline.<br />The strength of SHOPGIRL is the character development.  Martin has the rare talent of getting inside the heads of the key characters. He seamlessly moves from thoughts to feelings, dialog with another, then moves on to the second person's thoughts, feelings and finally the reply of the second character to the first.  He employs this strategy to illustrate emotional growth within ALL the personalities.  This is a difficult writing task because each time one character speaks to another; Martin performs six complex writing tasks.  When one analyzes his text, his writing is quite remarkable.<br />The storyline is sentimental, but not mushy.  The level of realism stifles any potential mushiness.  In addition, I suspect that Martin's character, Ray Porter, is a reflection of Martin's own personal experience.  This is a reasonable assumption since Ray Porter's character is quite profound.  Martin offers a greatest amount of depth in Porter's personality.  The realism of the storyline stems from the depth of the characters and corresponding personality development.<br />All in all, SHOPGIRL is a good story.  I highly recommend it - particularly if you are flying from Pittsburgh to Charlotte, North Carolina.  You can complete the entire book within that timeframe.	2002-10-27
US	51662980	R15YGA9FUDKJVQ	0446531332	939348220	Nights in Rodanthe	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	No surprise	I read the following novels written by Nicholas Sparks in this order: THE NOTEBOOK, MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, A WALK TO REMEMBER, THE RESCUE, BEND IN THE ROAD and finally NIGHTS IN RODANTHE.  My favorite is BEND IN THE ROAD.  I suspect that I like BEND IN THE ROAD the best because it is the least predictable.  Like most of his novels, NIGHTS IN RODANTHE is highly predictable.  Regardless of its predictability, I enjoyed reading it.<br />I am sure that those who have read his other novels will respond in the same manner as I did.  However, I don't think that people read Sparks to experience a surprise.  Sparks is a master of the English language and through his talent of constructing a sentence, he can induce a person to continue to read.  Sparks has the rare talent to draw a picture with words.  Characters come alive and make a connection with the reader.<br />The connection to real life that makes NIGHTS IN RODANTHE particularly compelling is the emergence of relationship triangles.  I related to at least four relationship triangles.  One of the three people has to make a decision reminiscent of Rick's final decision in the film CASABLANCA.  To follow a path that fulfill one's emotional needs or to follow a path that is less altruistic but clearly more noble?  Should a parent address the loneliness in one's life or focus on the needs of one's children?  \\"That is the question.\\"  In real life as in the book, one cannot have it all.  Like Rick in CASABLANCA and Paul in NIGHTS IN RODANTHE, only one decision can be made.  Once the decision is made, there is no turning back.<br />The elegance of NIGHTS IN RODANTHE is the author's ability to capture the feelings of making a critical decision and placing these feelings in the heart of the reader who vicariously identifies with the relationship triangle.	2002-09-28

All of his novels have been an `escape from reality' for me.  Yet, I must admit that all of his published work is not of equal quality.  Or perhaps a better way of articulating it, all of them are not equal in the quality of \\"escapism.\\"  For example, I have read the other two novels that Cussler has co-written with Kemprecos.  These include BLUE GOLD and SERPENT.  They were OK, but they were not able to achieve the quality of Cussler's other novels.  For example, I don't think that BLUE GOLD and SERPENT were nearly as well written as VALHALLA RISING and ATLANTIS FOUND.  However, I think FIRE ICE is a great improvement and has that `escape from reality' quality that I found in VALHALLA RISING and ATLANTIS FOUND.<br />To be more precise while reading FIRE ICE, I felt like I was watching a movie rather than reading a book.  When a book takes me away to a different place, it is a grand experience and my favorite type of reading.  I don't know what writing skills enable an author to accomplish this task, but feel sure that it has something to do with the disposition of the reader.  For example, Cussler and Kemprecos are able to make a highly implausible plot a plausible plot.  When this happens, I am locked into the novel and will not be able to put it down.  ICE FIRE and most all of Cussler's novels have this important quality - the implausible becomes plausible.<br />The bottom line is FIRE ICE has a quality far superior to BLUE OLD and SERPENT.  Let me know if you agree with me.	2002-09-18

For the last six years, I have been teaching Social Statistics to a wide variety of non-math majors (i.e., Nursing, Social Work, Sociology, Criminal Justice, Education, and Political Science). During the summer of 2002, I had an opportunity to teach a section of statistics exclusively to Nursing majors. Nurses are GREAT students. They seemed to have an intense interest in the application of statistics to nursing practice and evaluation. In addition, I learned that our local nurses are required to employ control charts to file a wide variety of reports to the hospital administration.  In an effort to teach relevant material, I searched amazon.com for \\"Control Charts\\" and discovered Kelley's outstanding book.<br />I can make a couple of points that may prove helpful to any reader of this review. First, Kelley is a wonderful writer. Making statistics fun, interesting, and relevant is a Herculean task. Kelley accomplishes this objective. Second, anyone who can get a C as a final grade in an introduction to statistics course will be able to understand and use control charts after reading Kelley's book. She offers GREAT examples and gives self-grading quizzes to facilitate the learning process.<br />Every nurse with whom I shared this book, seemed to appreciate it. Several of them actually purchased it. Thus, if you need information about control charts in a health care setting, Kelley is the best (and perhaps only) book on the market.	2002-09-02

I've been teaching statistics to students who have little interest in statistics.  In fact, most of them are math phobic.  Students who use STATISTICS FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED to supplement their learning just love it.  Jaisingh has a wonderfully creative mind.  He reduces complex concepts to the most fundamental meaning.  From that point, phobic students begin to understand the applications of statistics to their profession.  Most importantly, they experience success and become less math phobic.<br />One particularly section of his book stands out -- z-score transformation.  Understanding z-score transformation is a problem for many of my students.  After class lectures and reading Jaisingh's elaboration of these concepts, students gain insight.  Mose importantly than z-score transformation, students advance their knowledge regarding the relevance of normal distributions.<br />This is a worthy book for any math phobic student who is enrolled in a statistics course.	2002-07-13

The last two novels I started to read were so disappointing, I was unable to complete them.  CRITICAL MASS was incredibly intense; I could not stop reading it.  In fact, I read it to and from Dulles Airport (Washington, DC).  If you ever travel to and from Dulles after 911, you'll have a greater appreciation for CRITICAL MASS.<br />There are several comments I can make about CRITICAL MASS that will help one decide whether to the read this book.  First, I want to note that most the book reviews of CRITICAL MASS were written prior to 911.  Americans had a reality check since that dreadful day. If you read the other reviews, you'll note that some commented on the unbelievable elements with the storyline.  After 911, CRITICAL MASS seems VERY believable! Thus, I think CRITICAL MASS becomes much more meaningful after the events of 911.<br />Second, the author's writing is vivid.  His writing transports me to become a witness of the events leading to this horrific terrorist attack.  For me, reading CRITICAL MASS was more like watching a movie than reading a book.  The skills involved in writing to this degree of vividness requires the author to be a master of the English language.  His brilliance and command of written word is admirable!<br />The bottomline is, CRITICAL MASS is a wonderfully composed work of art.  The author's skill will enable your mind to leave your body and transport it to an adventure filled with intrigue and danger.	2002-07-13

It caught my eye because of its cover. At first, I thought it was pornography. However, a small group of women were also looking at it - [...] I picked it up and read the brief description on the back cover and concluded that this was not pornography. With the racy cover, I wonder what people would think if I read it on the plane. I bought it and read on my way home. I'm glad I did. I can make several points that might be helpful for others to decide if this is a good book.<br />First, Green has a rare talent. Effective character development within the pages of a novel is a formidable task. Most writers - even good ones - do not hit the bull's eye. Green does. She creates a moving picture of Jemima. The vividness of her words makes Jemima's physical transformation come alive. Her writing is quite remarkable and believable. After completing the book, I reflected on Jemima's weight loss program. Physiologically, I don't think Jemima's weight loss was possible. For me, this demonstrates that Green is a master of the written word. While reading, the impossible seemed possible.<br />Second, in addition to her vivid writing style, Green gets into the heads of Jemima and most of the secondary characteristics. Her talent enables the reader to appreciate the feelings and perceptions of the characters. This is what gives novels depth and a rich quality that can never be captured in a film. I enjoyed reading the thoughts of the characters - particularly during conversations with each other.<br />Third, I like a book with surprises. Although I found the end anticlimactic, there are great surprises in store for the reader. After the reader begins to empathize with Jemima, the story unfolds with a series and twists and turns that are totally unexpected. They are funny!<br />All and all this was a good read on a plane - but I hid the cover.	2002-04-23

Richmond, C.B.E.(1853-1949) : a discovery	Books	3	4	4	N	N	The Two Mary Richmonds	As I write this, I wonder if anyone will read it. However, if you are reading this, the information herein is critical for you.<br />I used amazon.com to search for a biography of Mary Richmond -- one of the historical leaders of social work. In my search, I found THE UNLIKELIEST LITTERATEUR: THE LIFE AND POETRY OF MARY E. RICHMOND. In stead of trying to purchase this out of print book online, I requested it through interlibrary loan.<br />First, THE UNLIKELIEST LITTERATEUR is a 4-volume set. I thought it was an incredible find when I read the first chapter of volume one. Wright (the author) indicates that Mary Richmond was an accomplished poet and a leader in social work. I continued to read. Something seemed strange. Wright continually referred to New Zealand (i.e., many of the citations were published in New Zealand). By the 4th volume, I concluded that there are two Mary E. Richmonds. One aspect of this research that made things difficult, the two Mary Richmond's were contemporaries!<br />The Mary E. Richmond, the focus of the book THE UNLIKELIEST LITTERATEUR, was a social worker in New Zealand -- who also wrote poetry.  Thus, I am very glad that I borrowed the 4 volumes through interlibrary loan rather than purchasing it as I normally would.<br />Bottom line: If you are interested in reading a biography of Mary Richmond author of SOCIAL DIAGNOSIS, FRIENDLY VISITING AMONG THE POOR, etc. don't trouble yourself by getting this 4 volume set.	2002-03-19

The second edition provides high-resolution color reproductions of the several graphics found in the first edition.  In addition, corrections were made. However, to most readers/users, I doubt that the changes would be worthy of purchasing the second edition if one already owns the first edition.<br />Edward R. Tufte is a noteworthy scholar and the presentation of the material presented in this book is awe-inspiring. Tufte has also compiled two other books that can be best described as quite remarkable. These additional books are entitled, ENVISIONING INFORMATION and VISUAL EXPLANATIONS. All three of these volumes are not merely supplemental textbooks; they are works of art.<br />My intent was to use VISUAL DISPLAY OF QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION as part of teaching my statistics course. Students, but mostly faculty, are overly impressed with inferential statistics. Graphics play an important role in the understanding and interpretation of statistical findings. Tufte makes this point unambiguously clear in his books.<br />Two features of VISUAL DISPLAY OF QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION are particularly salient in teaching a statistics course. First, the concept of normal distribution is wonderfully illustrated on page 140.  Here the reader is reinforced with the notion that in the normal course of human events, cultural/social/behavioral/ psychological phenomena usually fall into the shape of a normal distribution. The constant appearance of this distribution borders on miraculous. Just as importantly, it is the basis for accurate predications in all areas of science. Tufte's illustration (page 140) speaks to this issue much more clearly than a one-hour lecture on the importance of the normal distribution. Which goes to show -- once again -- \\"a picture is worth a thousand words.\\" Sadly, the illustration on page 140 is small and in black and white. I wish the second edition included a larger reproduction of this photo. A color presentation would have been helpful.<br />Second, Tufte continues his unrelenting pattern to reinforce the importance and impact of illustrations in understanding complex concepts. In particular, page 176 demonstrates the impact of Napoleon's march to Moscow. The illustration is both profound and eerie. The reader is left with a feeling of death and pain for the foot soldiers...r reproduction of this photo.

The last two Grisham novels I read were SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and A PAINTED HOUSE.  These are not what one would expect from Grisham.  Thus, when I purchased THE SUMMONS, I was a bit concerned that it was be in the same genre as the last two novels I read.  I was relieved to find that THE SUMMONS is a traditional Grisham novel.  It is going to be difficult to write about this novel without spoiling it.  I will be careful.<br />Grisham has a rare mastery of the English language.  He employs his skill to craft a story of two brothers - polar opposites.  One is a successful law professor who is held in high esteem within his academic community, while the other is a chronic addict with all the problems that substance abuse brings.  The bothers converge to deal with the death of their father - a man dearly loved by his community and hatred by both sons.  Like Grisham's novel THE TESTAMENT, this is a story that focuses on the mystery of a father's last will and testament.  Grisham takes his readers on a ride that is filled with intrigue and conniving.  I can't say more.<br />Grisham leaves us with an important thought - the right to self-determination.  If a legally competent person makes bad decisions, does a family member have the right to deny that person's destiny?  In his own way, Grisham's answer this ethical question.  As someone who teaches ethics, I will use this novel to illustrate the importance of this critical concept.<br />Although, THE SUMMONS may not be Grisham's best novel, it is a very good story.	2002-03-01

Among these, THE UNDERTAKER'S WIDOW is my favorite.  I don't believe that THE ASSOCIATE reaches the intrigue and peril that many of Margolin's other novels achieves, but it is still a worthwhile story.  Margolin has the uncanny ability to produce an element of surprise.  As a person reads Margolin's work, the reader attempts to predict the outcome.  Margolin seems to anticipate this and twist his tale in unexpected directions.  Thus, the reader sits on the edge of his/her chair waiting for the outcome - usually unanticipated.<br />Following is a description of what happened in my head while reading THE ASSOCIATE.  As I read, I anticipated an outcome.  I thought, \\"this is too obvious!\\"  I began to predict other less obvious outcomes.  My brain was twisted in different directions.  In the end, my initial prediction was the correct outcome.  And, of course, I wasn't expecting my thoughts to be correct.  I was surprised that I was surprised.<br />In the end THE ASSOCIATE is a good story.	2002-02-27

In this volume, Edward R. Tufte explores the visual and artistic aspects of the assessment of change, dynamics and most importantly cause and effect.  In my mind, Edward R. Tufte is one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century.  His work is magnificent!  He employs a powerful conceptual framework that has had a profound effect on the reader.<br />I own all three volumes.  I use VISUAL EXPLANATIONS: IMAGES AND QUANTITIES, EVIDENCE AND NARRATIVE when I teach statistics.  Students, but mostly professors, are too caught up with the power of inferential statistics leaving behind or seeing the visual display of data as insignificant or too simple to be introduced in a college course. Even worse, some are just plain ignorant regarding data presentation.  To dispel any attitude that inferential statistics are the heart and soul of the study of cause, I use the section about the Challenger space flight to illustrate the importance of graphic illustrations in the field of engineering.  The book hits home like no other visual presentation.  Students see how decisions are made on the basis of poor quality and high quality graphics.  These graphics produce a rare quietness in the classroom.  There emerges a respect for the deceased astronauts.  Students see how decision-makers employ graphic illustrations to determine a critical (in this case, life-threatening) course of action.  The illustrations played an important function in endorsing the liftoff of the doomed Challenger.<br />After students emotionally recover from the trauma of visually understanding the flaw in the O-rings, the graphics lead students to understand the statistical concept of \\"independence.\\"  This statistical concept is initially difficult for undergraduates to grasp.  However, the illustrations in VISUAL EXPLANATIONS provide a powerful springboard.<br />On the lighter side, I insist that students turn to page 90-91 to review the graphic that establishes the cause and effect of \\"rock `n roll.\\"  It, like all of Tufte's illustrations, is inspiring.<br />Every professor who teaches statistics should have a copy of this and Tufte's other volume entitled, THE VISUAL DISPLAY OF QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION.

US	51662980	RHCUR7N2H8LDF	0961392118	1623997	Envisioning Information	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Mapping at its best	ENVISIONING INFORMATION represents one volume within a set of three.  The primary objective of Edward R. Tufte is to demonstrate the importance of graphic illustrations in understanding the world around us.<br />In this volume, the central focus is to demonstrate how one can use static and a two-dimensional surface (i.e. a piece of paper) to show a world that is complex, dynamic and multidimensional.  The illustrations that he selects and his explanation of the impact of the illustrations is nothing less than magnificent.  Tufte is brilliant!  Unlike the other two volumes, the centerpiece of this work is mapping.  He addresses various artistic principles that offer a great clarity in guiding a scholar to reproduce distance and shapes.  I draw your attention to page 37. Here, we see a small piece of an &quot;Isometric Map of Midtown Manhattan.&quot;  The author gives us an opportunity to purchase the entire map.  I purchased the map for a close friend who calls Midtown Manhattan &quot;home.&quot;  It isn't merely a map; it is a beautiful piece of art.  According to the author, these mapping principles can be generalized to serve other functions.  For example, such techniques can be used to provide dance notations (see page 114-119).  That is, Tufte shows us how we can employ illustrations to teach people how to dance.<br />All of Tufte's three volumes are pieces of artwork.  All are awe-inspiring.  ENVISIONING INFORMATION is slightly different than the other two volumes.  I like to use Tufte's work as an example of how graphics can be employed to illustrate qantitative information to students.<br />Every academic library should own a copy of these three volumes.	2002-02-22

I found a copy of CIVIL AND SAVAGE ENCOUNTERS in a little bookstore while vacationing in Alaska.  The Alaskan landscape is beautiful and awe inspiring.  However, once I started reading this diary, I couldn't stop.  It is a treasure!  I stress, I became so engrossed in Golovin's exceptional descriptions, I totally lost interest in the beauty of Alaska.  I don't understand why this diary did not become a best seller.<br />I loved Golovin's comparative descriptions between his beloved Russia and Europe.  Americans will be mesmerized by his perception of the American Civil War.<br />Golovin has a charming and wonderful vividness in his writing style.  Could he have intended for his diary to be published?  On the other hand, I have often heard it said that we have lost the art of good writing.  We'll never learn the answer.  Regardless, CIVIL AND SAVAGE ENCOUNTERS is a wonderful piece of literature.	2002-02-21

US	51662980	R1KZMYWCUCPFID	0345402871	684823314	Airframe	Books	5	3	4	N	N	The plot is in the title	This is my first Michael Crichton novel.  At first, I hated it.  At the beginning, I found his style too slow moving for my taste.  Nothing seems to happen.  Yet, Crichton is a crafty writer.  Reading AIRFRAME is like putting together a fascinating puzzle. It starts slow but builds and builds and builds to the point of supersonic speed and intrigue.  He teases the reader to continue to read with mere tidbits of unrevealed clues - then he slaps the reader in the face.  Everything is laid out for the reader, but I missed it.  That's what makes this a great novel - the element of surprise.<br />Crichton's characters are also vivid.  In my experience, character development is the most complex and difficult task for a writer.  Crichton's mastery of the English language enables the reader to feel that the characters are real rather than fiction.  The pace in describing the main characters demonstrates his crafty writing skill.  His style produces a rare kind of realism that pushes the reader on the edge of the chair.  The vividness of being chased and falling are so genuine, one feels like one is watching a film rather than reading a book.<br />Lastly, and this will not spoil the plot, the story line can be found in the title.  Yet, I doubt that most readers will be able to put it all together until the last chapter.	2002-02-16

In addition, this volume is also helpful for practitioners.  It is a compilation of psychometric instruments that explicitly measure ethical concepts related to health care.  This book represents a gold mine of variable resources.  These instruments are extremely difficult and time consuming to find in the literature.<br />The authors include 31 instruments that are placed into the following categories:<br /> Patient Preference<br /> Patient Comprehension<br /> Decisional Capacity<br /> Advance Directives<br /> Withdrawal of Life Support<br /> Aggressiveness of Care<br /> Moral Sensitivity<br /> Ethical Practice Environment<br /> Recipient Selection<br /> General Issues for Health Professional<br />The authors include a summary of the psychometric qualities of each instrument -- validity, reliability and discussion of sampling to establish the norms.  This is what one would expect from the authors.  Unexpectedly, they include a critique of each instrument.  I found these sections quite fascinating and well-done.  One normally sees such critiques limited to the MENTAL MEASUREMENT YEARBOOK.<br />My research students are given an assignment in which they are required to review the reliability and validity of an instrument.  I have ordered a copy of MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS IN CLINICAL ETHICS for our academic library and requested that the book be placed on closed reserve with other books that also house psychometric instruments.<br />Those who are reading this review are also likely to require the same assignment.

In addition, I prefer to use psychometric instruments that appear to have some practical application.<br />Within THE THERAPIST'S NOTEBOOK we find approximately 83 different instruments that appear to have direct application to clinical practice.  Each instrument is discussed and the origin (i.e., methods of development, etc.) of each is cited.  The format for the describing each instrument is uniform and quite creative.  The authors do not employ standard psychometric jargon.  For example, they do NOT use common psychometric terms such as \\"reliability\\" and \\"validity,\\" but use clinical jargon -- \\"contraindications.\\"  Clinicians will appreciate the language, while academicians will giggle.  For academicians, the language is imprecise.  They want to know the reliability coefficient.  Clinicians need to know what type of client the instrument is best suited.  The bottom line is, clinicians learn a great deal of practical information, while at first glance academicians do not.  Academicians need not fret, citations are available.  Within the citations, one will probably find the details such as the precise coefficient.<br />Two additional points can be made.  First, I think many of these instruments are the exact tools many clinicians seek for the use within single system designs.  This is a GREAT book for those who use single system designs to evaluate the progress of their clients.  Second, ALL of the instruments are COPYRIGHTED!  This means that a clinician may NOT use any tools without written permission from the publisher.  It is illegal to do so.<br />All in all, this is a great book.  I will include it within my closed reserve readings.	2002-02-08

His mastery of the written word is best described as artful, clever, crafty, insightful and filled with emotion.  There is an uncommon vividness one reads within the pages of his novels.  He is an artist who paints a picture with words.  Good writers can create pictures in one's mind; thus, giving the reader a feeling of watching a film rather than reading a book.  I see this quality within the pages of A WALK TO REMEMBER.<br />Another rare quality within the pages of A WALK TO REMEMBER is much more difficult to articulate.  This novel brings forth an intense emotional reaction.  As I read it, my mind returned to a time in which I felt less jaded.  The feelings of \\"first love\\" experiences emerged.  For a time, I felt younger and later yearned for a past where I embraced optimism in a loving relationship.  \\"What could have been?\\" I privately asked in self-reflection.<br />As I ponder on the plot within A WALK TO REMEMBER, I am pulled back to reality.  My critical analysis suggests that this novel is nothing special.  There are no big surprises in the story line.  However, the profound elegance of this novel is not in the plot, but the grandeur of the author's ability to write and seduce the reader to unconsciously digging deep for emotions rarely felt.  There is a quiet intensity within these pages.  I have read all of Sparks' novels.  None of his other books possess such an emotional reaction.	2002-02-02

Some are better than others, but I love all of them!  Why?  I have a name for Cussler's books and his style of writing.  I call them process novels.  A process novel is a book in which the reader has a reasonably good idea of the ending, but nevertheless continues to read.  The reader realizes that a surprise ending is irrelevant.  The intriguing aspect of the story is the process by which the author \\"lands\\" on the last page.<br />Cussler has a crafty way of employing the English language to put his reader on the edge of the chair even while knowing -- in advance -- that the hero (i.e., Dirk Pitt) is going to survive.  His characters get into no-win situations and find a way out that has a nonfiction quality.  Thus, Cussler's rare talent is making the unbelievable - believable. VALHALLA RISING is a classic example of Cussler's rare talent --- with, and I stress this point - a surprise ending.<br />It goes without saying, that in this story, Dirk Pitt survives.  However, I can say with great confidence that none of Cussler's other novels ended in a manner that comes close to VALHALLA RISING.  Clearly, the ending is unexpected and uncharacteristic of all his other work.  In this respect, it is my opinion that VALHALLA RISING is Cussler's greatest novel.  I am anxiously awaiting the next novel in this series.  If it is as half as good as VALHALLA RISING, it will be stupendous.	2002-01-31

In fact, many Americans who love THE PROPHET don't realize the existence of his other work. This is too bad.<br />THE MADMAN was first published in 1918. Although written nearly 100 years ago, it remains timely. In addition, it was Gibran's first published verse. It went out of print several years ago, but has recently been made available.

By today's standards, the material written in this book is nothing we couldn't hear on TV.  However, that was NOT true in the 1970's.  On the other hand, some of the pictures would still never pass the TV censors in the US.<br />The authors take a scholarly and applied approach to the issue of sexual functioning for a wide range of disabilities.  I don't think they missed much.  The writing is sensitive, thoughtful and very much unlike what one would expect.  Since 1974, many other books have been written on disability and sexuality.  To my mind, NOT MADE OF STONE remains the best.  It is sad that this book is out of print.	2002-01-27

I find two critical elements within THE RESCUE.<br />The first is predictability.  I found no significant plot surprises.  As a reader, I liked being surprised.  However, as soon as the characters of Denise, Taylor and Kyle were introduced, I knew the direction of their relationship.  I suspect that my lack of surprise emerged from my knowledge of the author.  Thus, for the element of \\"surprise,\\" Sparks gets 1 star.<br />The second is imagery. One can easily be critical of Sparks' plot and story line, but HE is a master of the written word.  He has an extraordinary and crafty writing skill.  In many ways, Sparks paints a story with words.  He creates pictures in the mind.  There is a vividness within his words that induces the feelings of watching a movie rather than reading a book.  What a talent!  Thus, for the element of \\"imagery,\\" Sparks get 11 stars.<br />If the element of surprise is important to you, you'll be disappointed with THE RESCUE.  If you have passion for the elegance, grace and beauty of the written word, you love this book.	2002-01-27

I stopped to watch the morning news where the author, Umberto Eco, was being interviewed because his book, THE NAME OF THE ROSE, was just published.  I took pause because Eco was an Italian Sociologist.  So am I!  I watched with great interest and learned that Eco employed sociological insights and historical scholarship in the development of a highly praised and highly complex story.  I became very curious and made a mental note to read it after I completed my Ph.D.  I did.<br />In fact, I read it during the mid 90's and several times after that.  There are few novels that must be read more than once.  THE NAME OF THE ROSE is one of them.  The plot is not complex.  However, the dialog and symbols are.  Thus, if one doesn't have a handle on church history prior to the protestant reformation and sociological theory, one will strain to comprehend much of the story.  Even if one has an academic background in these various areas, one will need to read it closely.  In addition, the novel was translated from Italian.  I suspect many important ideas were lost in the translation.<br />This is not your basic detective story - although it has most of the elements of a good detective novel.  It is artfully done with wonderful descriptions.  This is a novel of process not of outcome.  It is a story of intrigue, mystery, and debauchery with a 13th century monastery as the backdrop.  I've enjoyed this story EVERY time I read it.	2002-01-27

I thought this monograph would help me with my undergraduate teaching duties.  Well, it didn't.  Thus, if that's your objective, don't buy it.<br />If you're interested in seeking the board range of directions for applied statistics, this is your book.  In my disappointment in realizing that this book is not what I thought it would be, I read it anyway.  It is quite well written.  For me, I thought I would only be interested in the social science section, but I found some of the Engineering and Physicial Science chapters helpful.  All the chapters are quite insightful.<br />The only disappointing aspect of the monograph was the incomplete information on the autocorrelation debate for time series data.  I wanted to know more.<br />Otherwise, it is a nice set of statistical readings.	2002-01-21
US	51662980	R2MTGYPBSYAR56	0684864657	2315012	A Personal Odyssey	Books	5	19	19	N	Y	Unexpected and Inspiring	Because Thomas Sowell is one of the great intellectuals of the 20th century, I felt compelled to read his autobiography.  I'm not suggesting that I wanted to read it, I felt compelled to do so.  I've always admired Sowell's positions (this is not to say that I agree with him) and have suggested that my minority students use him as a role model.  After reading his autobiography, I realize that thinking this way was a mistake.  Sowell must be a role model for all students (regardless or race) and for all professors.  Several aspects of this book struck a cord within me.<br />First although I always admired Sowell, but I never suspected that he had anything that came close to what I would call a sense of humor.  He never smiles during a TV interview (understandable after reading his book).  His writing is always scholarly and emotionally detached.  However, the pranks he pulled while a Marine were hilarious and made me laugh aloud.  It wasn't what I was expecting of Sowell.  Second, much of what I learned about him on the TV news was false.  Within the pages of this book, I was quite shocked to read about his political and economic positions during the Reagan administration.  News reports were outrageously inaccurate.  I always pictured him as a \\"Black Republican.\\"  In reality, he never fit into that category.  At best, he could be described as a libertarian.  More accurately, he ignores ideology and selects a position that includes some empirical support.  The bottom line is: Sowell's perspective is thoughtful and he embraces positions that are \\"right\\" rather than popular.  He has never followed the path of least resistance except for one possible exception.<br />I find only one sour note in the entire book.  While working for US Government, he was confronted with two conflicting theories regarding wage control for sugar manufacturing in Puerto Rico.  He was the only economist in the department that conceptualized a research design to resolve the theoretical conflict.  Because of some bureaucratic agendas within our government, he was unable to acquire the data.  The theory was never tested and this saddens me.  It is uncharacteristic of Sowell to surrender so easily.  Based on the rest of his autobiography, I am quite surprised that he never returned to the issue.  I'm sure he could get grant funding for this unfinished business.<br />This is a delightful book.  It is humorous and insightful.  Sowell sees himself as unassuming.  The best single word to describe him is courageous.  I wish I read this book sooner.  It is quite inspiring.cal conflict.

The last time I had an economics course was during the academic year 1967-68.  Since then, many of my courses included major components of economic theory and readings in economics.  In addition, as a director of a program, I am held responsible for the managing a budget.  I've never had an accounting course.  I am able to manage my budget with my computer knowledge and by directing questions to two friends who are accountants.<br />If you are like me, Slater's work SIMPLIFYING ACCOUNTING LANGUAGE is great!  The book accomplished two critical goals.  First, it breaks down accounting to its simplest components.  Anyone who has completed an accounting course will find the book too elementary.  Anyone who hasn't, but is forced to manage a budget will find the book to be refreshing.  Second, if one has to ask dumb questions to an accountant, SIMPLIFYING ACCOUNTING LANGUAGE will provide a person with an appropriate vocabulary to sound coherent.  Like all professionals, accountants have a language all of their own.  One needs the proper vocabulary to speak to them.<br />As I write, one of the biggest news items is the Enron scandal.  Apparently the Arthur Andersen accounting firm mismanaged the books.  This entire fiasco has had a major effect on several sectors of the economy and has place many aging working in financial jeopardy.  As I monitor the CNN web site, I must acknowledge that substantial amount of my understanding of news items comes from my reading of Slater's fine book.	2002-01-17

For each edition, the editors search the literature for instruments that demonstrate practical and research applications.  They study and report on the calibration issues for each instrument.  These issues include scoring, sampling, reliability and validity.  Of course, they include the citations of their sources.<br />Although the primary audience for these volumes are clinicians and researchers (in that order), I have been using these volumes as a teaching tool.  After giving a lecture on the meaning of reliability and validity, I have my students search out an instrument and assess the quality it.  MEASURES FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE Volumes I and II are ideal sources for this assignment.  They look at the instrument for face validity and read the editor's commentary on sampling, reliability and validity; then comment on the application in the practice arena.<br />Two limitations exist for these volumes.  First, these are instruments for clinicians.  The two volumes do not include any instruments that focus on macro variables that need to be measured.  Perhaps a third volume should be considered for the next edition.  Second, in terms of teaching instrument calibration to students, an expanded index would be most helpful.  In the index, types of reliability and validity could be listed.  Thus, students could hunt for an instrument that employs a technique they want to study.<br />Fischer and Corcoran must be applauded that their painstaking work.	2002-01-14

However, one day I shall go to New York City and will visit the Brooklyn Bridge.  As a one-time student of architecture, I find this bridge particularly inspiring.  Knowing of my interest in the Brooklyn Bridge, a very close friend and native New Yorker, gave me THE SPIDER OF BROOKLYN HEIGHTS as a gift.<br />Veglahn's work is an historical novel that describes the construction of this impressive landmark.  Although it lacks technical details and includes some factual inaccuracies, I love this book!  One factual inaccuracy includes her description of the pillars.  She has the order of them reversed.  Historically, the construction of first pillar was not problematic, the second one was.  If the first pillar were as problematic as the second was, the construction would have been halted.  Thus, the loss of life and physical damage to the workers (and primary architect) occurred at the point of no return within the depths of the second pillar.<br />THE SPIDER OF BROOKLYN HEIGHTS offers a sentimental view of the bridge.  It is a story of people not primarily of the technological marvel.  Despite some inaccuracies, I dearly love this book -- not only for the content, but also for the person who gave it to me.	2002-01-13

No, I am not having a senior moment; it is just that none of my readings have been inspiring.  Thus, none of them are memorable.<br />Proehl's book ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE IN THE HUMAN SERVICES does not fit the standard mold.  Proehl's writing is inspiring - almost to the point of being exciting.  I believe she will be able to induce students to think more seriously about pursuing management and policy as an area of practice.  Those students who do not pursue the macro path will have a greater appreciation for agency policy and management.  In addition, clinical graduates who read Proehl's work will be able to effectively integrate macro concepts into their clinical repertoire.<br />I am particularly impressed with her examples, use of measurement to address change, strategies for implementing change and most importantly - her writing.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-01-13

Outside of the death of a child, the most heart wrenching experience a parent can face is having a disabled child.  \\"Heart wrenching\\"?  Perhaps a word too strong?  Yes, Marshak, Seligman and Prezant make this clear in their book.  In some cases, the disabled child changes the configuration of the family into something unexpectedly positive.  Within this book, we see writing that is refreshing because the authors offer an uncommon perspective on disability and the family.<br />DISABILITY AND THE FAMILY LIFE CYCLE is the most comprehensive and up-to-date source book I have been able to find and read.  In addition to being helpful for professionals who work with families with disabled children, I think that some parents will find the book emotionally rewarding.<br />This is an excellent piece of thoughtful scholarship.

In fact, I've read all of DNA's books including his nonfiction such as THE DEEPER MEANING OF LIFF and LAST CHANCE TO SEE.  Of all the books, THE LONG DARK TEA-TIME OF THE SOUL is by far my favorite.  I must add, there is no piece of fiction that I have read as many times as THE LONG DARK TEA-TIME OF THE SOUL.<br />Why would a person read this novel more that once?  First, it is hilarious!  The dialogs and interaction among the characters are well honed.  This description of airports on the first couple of pages will induce everyone to continue reading.  Second, the story and the underlying theoretical principles that guide the novel are quite complex.  Thus, a person can read this novel ten times and still undercover an unanticipated wrinkle that sheds new light on the plot and subplots.  Third, from an academic perspective, Dirk Gently employs an \\"ecological system model\\" as the centerpiece of his investigative tools.  Gently's worldview represents an extreme form of a theory that student's commonly learn in college.  Teaching the theoretical principles of the ecological system model is a stuffy and arduous enterprise.  However, using Dirk Gently as an example opens the door for understanding among many college students.  Back in 1991, I emailed DNA about how I was using his novel in class.  He replied and was pleased with my efforts.<br />I love this book and feel sad that I will not have the pleasure reading more of DNA's work.	2002-01-12

First, her strong female lead characters are refreshing.  I've always had a particular fascination for the Kay Scarpetta character.  Second, Cornwell is a master of the English language and uses her skills to capture the depth of her characters.  In this manner, the reader acquires the feeling that \\"I'm not reading a novel.\\"  There is an uncanny vividness in the way Cornwell crafts her stories.  Third, Cornwell typically presents a technical dimension to her stories that demonstrate that she completed substantial research prior to writing the novel.<br />ISLE OF DOGS is different from her other novels.  The main character is not female.  For me, that was sad.  Many of the characters lack depth seen in her past work.  The central character in ISLE OF DOGS has no depth.  However, the governor's daughter adds an interesting flavor to the plot.  On the brighter side, Cornwell retains her vividness and mastery of the written word.  I didn't particularly like the story line, but I appreciate Cornwell's mastery of the English language.  In addition, Cornwell shows off her impressive knowledge of helicopters.  She did her research.<br />So what does this mean?  If you read ISLE OF DOGS because you like novels of about strong women figures, you will not be satisfied with this book.  Here you will find a well-written humorous story where the ending is predictable but the process of getting to the end of this tale is not predictable.	2002-01-11

I have adopted this text for my social policy course since the first edition.<br />The hallmark to Jansson text is that he offers the best framework for generalist practice.  Other policy textbooks perceive policy-making as an enterprise dominated by great persons who direct great ideas on a macro level.  Policy, in this sense, is the development and maintenance of programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  Jansson makes it clear that policy encompasses all aspects of social work intervention.  For example, Jansson offers students a framework to comprehend the lack of adequate parking spaces on campus and -- what to do about it.  Thus, Jansson enables the student to understand that policies operate on the micro, mezzo and macro levels.<br />Jansson spends most of his energy on the application of micro policy issues.  This is most appropriate for two reasons.  First, I estimate that 90% of social work graduates who are required to read this text will face micro policy issues on a daily basis.  Unless they reflect back on what they learn from Jansson, they won't realize it.  Second, for those who actually obtain policy positions, it is unlikely that they will be involved in making grand decisions in the arena of what is thought to be classic policies (e.g. Social Security).  They are most likely to be making policy decisions regarding the use of the copy machine, discharging staff, hiring (including issues like affirmation action for the agency staff) etc.  No other text will assist the student in these areas as much as Jansson.<br />There is no doubt in my mind that Jansson offers the BEST text for a social policy course.  However, he has one serious limitation.  His writing is terrible.  He can't seem to write in an economical manner.  In a discussion in an open forum, I made this observation.  Other professors thanked me.  Everyone in the room knew it was true, but no one wanted to say it aloud - except perhaps me.<br />The bottom line is, Jansson offers the best text for a social policy course.  However, his writing is overly sophisticated, students must be spoon-fed this framework.  Once students comprehend his essential points, they have a clear understanding of policy development and maintenance.  Some of them, because of Jansson, decide to pursue a career in policy rather than clinical social work.Jansson offers the best text for a social policy course.

It is, in fact, a story of how technology interacts with basic human feelings.<br />Several points about this novel can be made.  First, it is well written.  The entire book is e-mail correspondence - a very creative and difficult approach to story development.  Second, considering the fact that the author limited the telling of this story to e-mail transition, the character development and evolution is quite remarkable.  Third, people who are not perpetual users of email will NOT understand the content.<br />I have some relevant side issues. First, the quality of the writing doesn't seem fabricated.  It seems too real to be fiction.  If the text came out of the author's head, she has a marvelously creative head on her shoulders.  Frankly, it seems more like something like this happened to the author.  Second, I think the book was published prematurely.  In 1996, when the book was first published, less than half Americans had email.  Only those who were experienced with the Internet would have an inclination to read it.<br />Bottomline:  This is a GREAT story.  It is well written and creative.	2002-01-05

Next thing I knew, BRIDGES made the best sellers list.  This was in the early 90's.  The book became a common topic of conversation among my friends.  In fact, one friend and I spoke of the book a great deal.  It is a book to make one think and discuss.<br />A year or so later, I came across SLOW WALTZ IN CEDAR BEND - quite by accident.  When I made the connection with THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, I immediately purchased the book, read it, then shared it with my friend with whom I had long discussions about Walker's first novel.  Frankly, I liked SLOW WALTZ IN CEDAR BEND much better than THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.  I remember seeing myself in the main character.  This character, Michael Tillman, mesmerized me.<br />Twelve years later, I was looking for a book on tape to keep me company on a long lonely drive, I bought SLOW WALTZ IN CEDAR BEND forgetting that I read the novel 12 years earlier.  During the second reading (or listening), I found that I enjoyed the author's writing and his imagery, but didn't find any connection between the main character and me.  In fact, I didn't realize that I had read this novel before until I got to the part where Michael Tillman finds Jellie Braden on an Island in India.  Reading this book for a second time was a fascinating experience.  I continued to enjoy Walker's writing style, but the novel had a much different emotional impact on me.  I suspect that my two experiences were the result of the author's crafty skill with the written word.<br />For those, who read SLOW WALTZ IN CEDAR BEND when it first some out, I recommend to read it again.

He has a Masters in Sociology and a Doctorate in English Literature.  As a result, we find a well-written book with profound sociological insights.  Generally speaking, sociologists are not well known for being good writers.  Steele is clearly the exception.<br />From a sociological perspective, Steele employs an ecological system model as a tool to capture his personal experience enabling the reader comprehend his emergence into manhood in a racially biased society.  Yes, I admit my description sounds like a bunch of academic hogwash.  However, Steele masterfully strips away the academic jargon to create a meaningful book that everyone can grasp without being diverted by theoretical language.  His use of a theory as a backdrop provides the reader with a connection - a meaningful experience.<br />For several decades, sociologists have been attempting to link personality with the social structure in a manner that has some practical and meaningful application.  Up to this point, all attempts have been miserable failures.  Here lies Sheby Steele's great success.  He created this important theoretical linkage hitherto unseen in American social science.<br />What value does THE CONTENT OF OUR CHARACTER offer us?  Steele brilliantly portrays race relations as a connection between the micro and macro human experience.  In many ways, Steele succeeded to do what Parsons dreamed about in the 1940's.  Steele identifies that racial problems cannot be solved merely by instituting (macro) policy change.  He states that everyone has a personal (micro) responsibility to embrace the role of change agent.  Most interestingly, his primary focus is directed toward African American individuals.  Change yourself and change society simultaneously.<br />This is one of the most readable books on race relations.  I often assign college students (even minority students) to read this book.

In addition, Steele is a brilliant writer.  I never tire of good writing.<br />A DREAM DEFERRED reminds me of a rather poignant experience I had with an Ohio State University doctoral student.  Three of us were sitting together over some coffee.  Two of us were white male graduates, while the third was a Native American graduate student.  He lamented the racial discrimination he faced with one particular professor.  My colleague and I were quite distressed with the comments from this young man.  We had some power and could do something about this unsavory situation.  With some prodding, the young man eventually told us who the professor was.  Upon hearing the name, puzzlement came over our faces, then a smirk.  We were both familiar with the professor in question.  He was terse, pompous and arrogant - all common characteristics of doctoral faculty.  However, he was NOT a racist.  We were able to convince the young man that his experience was not racially motivated but rather the professor was simply a jerk.  No, he wasn't a racist; he merely treated everyone like trash.<br />A DREAM DEFERRED provides the basis for whites to understand the predicament faced by many minorities.  They have difficulty distinguishing between social activities that are racially motivated and social activities that emerge as stressful but have no elements of racial bias.  Steele suggests that whites must stand firm.  Funny thing is -- Steele is well aware that most white will not follow his directions.  African Americans must take the lead.	2001-12-09

It is an amazing and heroic story.<br />In some respects, A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN is written too much like a novel. For example, the book includes a substantial number of quoted dialogs and conversations. Clearly, Suskind wasn't present nor were these experiences videoed or tape-recorded. For me -- and I may be alone one this - the book loses much of its credibility in the telling of this true story. On the other hand, I suspect Suskind developed this strategy to make the book more readable for the general public. This leads me to have one thought. To what degree is this story true? I am reassured that most of the writing is an accurate depiction of Cedric's life story because Cedric would have read it and would have commented on the accuracy of it. In addition, pages 369-370 provide some reassurance.<br />I think in many ways, A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN is an unfinished book. For me, the book ends rather abruptly. Cedric merely begins his long journey. If he continues to progress successfully in his academic career, I feel sure that we will see an additional book. If not... well, you know what that will mean. Although the book ends abruptly, it ends with optimism.<br />The book, when taken as a totality, is the strongest argument for affirmative action. To bring the point home, I required my social work students to read CREATING EQUAL: MY FIGHT AGAINST RACE PREFERENCES by Ward Connerly. Regardless of their race, students begin to develop sympathy for those who oppose affirmative action. Immediately following their reading of Connerly's work, I require them to read A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN. Cedric's life provides the strongest argument for affirmative action. It is utterly fascinating to witness students synthesizing the content of these two well-written books. So, I recommend that everyone read both books - one immediately following the other.books - one immediately following the other.	2001-12-08

Ward Connerly book's CREATING EQUAL: MY FIGHT AGAINST RACE PREFERENCES will be one of the most memorable.  Why?  Ward Connerly does not take the popular position.<br />Readers do not have to like him or his ideas to realize that Connerly is a man a great courage.  He is well known and even hated for his position on affirmative action.  However, reading his elegant words within CREATING EQUAL creates second thoughts among those who are strongly opposed to his ideology.  Connerly lays out how his upbringing drove him to believe that Affirmative Action does more damage than good.  Most of his logical positions are solid well thought out and have a great deal of merit.  Nevertheless, we can find flaws in his position.<br />I have actually required CREATING EQUAL to be read by social work majors who are strongly in favor of affirmative action.  After reading this book, ALL of them changed their position.  This is not to say that all of them started to oppose affirmative action, but clearly, their positions in favor of affirmative action were softened.  Reading CREATING EQUAL creates second thoughts.<br />To induce students to use their critical thinking skills, I often require them to read A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN immediately after reading CREATING EQUAL.  Suskind, the author of A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN, chronicles the life of an African American young man's struggle to gain an education.  Cedric Jennings' life provides the strongest argument for affirmative action.  It is utterly fascinating to witness students synthesizing the content of these two well-written books.  So, I recommend that everyone read both books - one immediately following the other.	2001-12-08

As a gerontologist, I have read many books on drugs and drug interaction for elderly patients. All of them were thoughtfully written and had salient points. However, if you asked me to provide you with a list of books I've read on this subject, I couldn't help you. I didn't keep them. In fact, I gave them away. Nothing I have read seemed relevant to my work with elderly patients. However, I'll keep Salzman's book.<br />Two critical points can be made about this important volume.<br />First, it is well written. Salzman has a rare ability to captivate his readers. Please realize that PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS is an academic book. It is not suppose to be interesting, but it is. I think the case illustrations are particularly good.<br />Second, it is relevant to gerontologists who are NOT physicians. After reading this book, I can more clearly understand issues that physicians must address and comprehend how medication mistakes can be made.<br />Everyone who is concerned about drugs and elderly should read this book and retain it as a reference. It's a keeper.	2001-11-21

Sparks has a rare ability to create pictures in my mind.  Reading his words is like watching a movie.  Such a skill requires the author to be a master of words, have rare insights into the human experience, the ability to surrender one's soul to the reader, and to offer the reader the unexpected.  Clearly, Sparks has all four of these critical qualities.<br />I didn't enjoy THE BEND IN THE ROAD as much as I have enjoyed his other work.  I wonder why?  The quality of his writing has not diminished.  Reading THE BEND IN THE ROAD (as his other novels) is still like watching a movie.  After a considerable amount of thought, I think I understand.  Writers such as Sparks invest their heart and soul into their novels.  Not only does the reader receive a profound and enlightening experience from the words in the book, but also I suspect that unconsciously the reader comes to know the author.  Perhaps, the reader comes to know the author TOO well.  Thus, Sparks cannot meet the fourth criteria listed above.  Those who know his work -- know him.  Knowing the author too well handicaps the element of surprise.<br />Nevertheless, THE BEND IN THE ROAD is a charming story that is thoughtfully written.  In particular, people who have not read Sparks in the past will be captivated.	2001-11-09

Of these, I think MOTHER! THE FRANK ZAPPA STORY by Michael Gray is the second best.  Each of these biographies illustrates a different dimension of Zappa's complex personality.  It is almost like each author is writing about a different person.  Some book reviewers have suggested that some of the authors are not accurate (less delicately - lying).  No, it is simply a matter of focusing on a single dimension of the multidimensional, Frank Zappa.<br />Gray creates a picture of Zappa that the other authors missed.  Unlike other authors, Gray offers the reader details of Zappa's perspective on the political economy.  He was a libertarian! Fans of Zappa know he was a paradox and an enigma, but Gray is able to help the reader understand this perception with his focus on Zappa's interest in the economy.  This is a fascinating excursion into Zappa's life story<br />My favorite poster of Zappa can be found on the 5th page after page 64.  It is a poor reproduction of the original.  It's grainy.  The key point is, this picture of Zappa offers great support for Gray's thesis.<br />Gray's portrayal of Zappa is different from the other biographies.  Zappa is an enigma.

As a result, I believe I have reviewed most of the textbooks in the area. As a result, I feel I can make a couple of remarks regarding the work of DePoy and Gitlin.<br />First and foremost, this is a textbook. It was specifically designed for students in allied health professional studies and human service curricula. Compared to most textbooks, it is NOT dry writing. Clearly, the authors have a flare for words.<br />Second, the primary strength of this text is its evenhandedness. More so than any other text, DePoy and Gitlin address both the qualitative and quantitative methodologies. No text completes this task as effectively and as efficiently.<br />When Ph.D. students (within my doctoral cohort) were being educated, they shared an unsavory learning experience. Most of us were taught to become number crunchers. The value of qualitative research was downplayed. In some cases we were specifically taught that qualitative research methodologies were hampering the image and progress of the social sciences. Thus, qualitative techniques were portrayed as a strategy employed by professors to engage the interest of undergraduate students. Qualitative methods were often adopted as a &quot;play time.&quot; The possible exception for my observation is anthropology. However, even doctoral educators in anthropology noted the value of number crunching.<br />DePoy and Gitlin offer a doorway to turn our thinking around. They contend that the research question must drive the research method - not the other way around. During my education (Baccalaureate, Masters, and Ph.D.), I was taught to design research questions that could be answered by employing regression analysis or a variation of it. DePoy and Gitlin do more to legitimize qualitative methodologies than any current authors. They accomplish this task by systematically examining a wide range of methods by demonstrating the value of each.<br />I see two problems.<br />First, the authors have embarked on a Herculean task. They skim the surface of the various methodologies, but offer little depth. In the end, students will not have an adequate knowledge base to employ any single research method without some additional educational support. Perhaps such educational support is a role for the research professor. Thus, the lack of depth may be a blessing in disguised.<br />Second, few of my students (3 to 25%) will enroll in graduate school. Thus, it is highly unlikely that they will be actively involved in a substantive research project. These students need to employ research methodologies to improve their job performance and gain insight into self-evaluation. This is a flaw in the work of DePoy and Gitlin. The authors do not directly address self-evaluation.<br />In the end, I believe that DePoy and Gitlin offers the best preparation for graduate school. Nothing comes closer. I highly recommend this book.<br />First, the authors have embarked on a Herculean task. They skim the surface of the various methodologies, but offer little depth.

Of all of theses, Alter and Evans offer the most comprehensive work. They conceptualize six techniques to evaluate one's practice. These include 1) Case Study; 2) Target Problem Scaling; 3) Goal Attainment Scaling; 4) Monitoring Designs; 5) Baseline Designs; and 6) Multiple Baseline Designs. Besides offering an explanation of each approach to evaluation, the authors provide multiple examples on how they can be used. Their approach is excellent for student learning. Thus, more so than any other text on evaluation, Alter and Evens do the absolutely best job of embracing the generalist model.<br />Second, the authors do an excellent job of helping students understand the SUBSTANTIVE difference between qualitative and quantitative methods. Most authors merely offer a superficial acknowledgement of qualitative research strategies. Alter and Evens unambiguously define the nature of research methods: the question being asked must drive the research method, not the other way around. The sad fact is most textbooks address quantitative methods and train students to limit their research questions to number crunching. After reading Alter and Evens, students will understand the value of having a variety of evaluative approaches to employ.<br />Lastly, one major and serious problem arises within the pages of this book. It is filled with typographical errors. The large number of errors is embarrassing. Even students spot them!<br />All in all, the concept behind the book is excellent. Springer must produce a second edition without so many typos.	2001-09-16

In my more recent years, I have enjoyed reading about his work and life.  The books I have read include:<br />THE REAL FRANK ZAPPA BOOK by Frank Zappa and Peter Occhioigrosso<br />ELECTRIC DON QUIXOTE: THE DEFINITIVE STORY OF FRANK ZAPPA by Neil Slaven<br />NECESSITY IS...

Clearly this title accurately reduces Zappa's musical contribution to the fewest read possible words.  Thus, the title is a masterpiece of composition and creativity.<br />In many ways, the book's content is similar to THE REAL FRANK ZAPPA BOOK.  However, Slaven doesn't offer that whimsical and playful flavor that is found in Zappa's and Occhioigrosso's words.  Slaven lays out the facts in a well-written and humanistic manner.  Of books in my Zappa library, Slaven offers the most even-handed approach.  I didn't find this even-handed approach in any of the other Zappa books I have read.  However, being even-handed can lead to some dry reading, but nonetheless still worthy for those interested in Zappa's life.<br />One significant reaction emerges in my head.  I hope young musicians read ELECTRIC DON QUIXOTE.  Zappa made some critical errors of judgement early in his career that effected his entire life.  The evil characters - in this and other Zappa biographies - are record company executives.  In his naivet&eacute;, Zappa was too trusting or too hungry to make rational decisions prior to signing a record deal.  If young musicians carefully read ELECTRIC DON QUIXOTE (and COSMIK DEBRIS by Greg Russo), they can avoid making the mistakes that plagued Zappa and the Turtles.<br />The ELECTRIC DON QUIXOTE will be enjoyed by all Zappa fans.  In addition, I think it should be required reading for all musicians who intend to record.IC DON QUIXOTE (and COSMIK DEBRIS by Greg Russo), they can avoid making the mistakes that plagued Zappa and the Turtles.<br />The ELECTRIC DON QUIXOTE will be enjoyed by all Zappa fans.

I can summarize LOVE &amp; ECONOMICS with a true story: While I was a child, my (full-time) mother -- while in a state of total exasperation - lamented to me, \\"The hardest job in the world is raising children.\\"  Being the perfect child :-), I simply thought that her statement was a gross exaggeration.  Raising my own child and having a greater variety of jobs than my mother ever did, I can say that my mom's original comment is a gross understatement.<br />I think that Roback and her colleagues at the Hoover Institute may have heart attacks as a result of my first reaction to LOVE &amp; ECONOMICS.  Many of the ideas Roback presents carry the identical theme found in Clinton's IT TAKES A VILLAGE.  Here we find Clinton suggesting ideas like: We have two choices, to guide our children around negative influences and toward positive ones, or to allow our children to wander without us through a labyrinth of the predators which include violence, recreational sex, substance abuse, reckless conduct, and other immoralities.  Do we live in an evil world?  59% of the children born in our regional hospital are born out of wedlock.  Who is going to guide these children?  Familyless children are the peers of my child.  This is a fear that is shared by both liberals and conservatives.<br />Roback addressed the above stated concept by noting that in the late 60's, our society embraced a \\"me first\\" philosophy.  We remain egocentric.  This egocentrism that Roback has identified is the heart of the problem for the American family.  She shocks us with some critically important information.  Both Liberals and Conservatives embrace egocentrism.  They do for different reasons, but they both do it.  The important historical/sociological issue is, there are no credible voices that reject the \\"me first\\" philosophy.  In fact, Roback may be the first.  Even social institutions such as the Church (conservative and liberal) embraces egocentrism!  What hope do children have?  Roback states that our only hope is reshaping the American family.  Focus on children, not ourselves.<br />I can make three additional but unrelated reactions to LOVE &amp; ECONOMICS.<br />First on a scholarly level, Roback attempts to define, describe and/or explain the contemporary American family by employing one of two philosophical devices, reductionism and/or emergentism.  Both efforts fail miserably.  However, this is not the fault of the author. \\"Family\\" cannot be understood by employing either micro or macro concepts. There is simply no adequate language to articulate many of the complex concepts addressed in this book.  Roback did the best she could with the theoretical frameworks currently available.<br />Roback failed to provide an economic explanation for the current family structure - but maybe that wasn't the point she wanted to make.  She seems to be saying that children are an economic liability not an asset.  They consume economic resources.  They are economically unproductive and establish roadblocks for their parents' economic productivity.  Those who are preoccupied with seeking wealth should not have children.<br />Lastly, I know both my sisters would dearly enjoy reading this book, but neither one would even consider it.  Both found the title profoundly and patently offensive.  It took me a very long time to understand their perspectives.  I sensed that neither of them thought that the word \\"love\\" and \\"economics\\" should be in the same sentence.  I think they would have read it, if it was entitled something like, THE LAISSEZ-FAIRE FAMILY.<br />Don't be like my sisters.  Roback's work is worth reading.

Dr. Spivey's work entitled NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE CAROLINA BORDERLANDS: A CRITICAL ETHNOGRAPHY will interest a specific group of readers.  These include: professors and students of qualitative research methods (particularly ethnography), theory construction, Native American Studies, and those who reside on the eastern borderline between North and South Carolina.<br />I read a number of ethnographical research - mostly as a Ph.D. student.  I may be alone of this, but my general impression is... few were worthwhile to read.  My lack of appreciation for ethnography and other forms of qualitative analysis may be attributed to my background in quantitative methods.  Perhaps I just don't get it.  Unlike my past experience in reading such work, I DID appreciate the craftsmanship found within Spivey's book.  His writing is remarkably good for this type of work.  He has clear and specific goals that can be generalized and employed as examples for instruction of graduates and undergraduates students.<br />Native American students who are seeking degrees in the social sciences will find this book particularly useful.  In addition to the substance Spivey provides, his book offers a good research model that will enable others to effectively apply ethnography to the study of other Native American traditions.<br />All in all, Spivey does a fine job.  I strongly recommend this book for social science students and professors.	2001-08-03

Anyone who has read THE REAL FRANK ZAPPA BOOK will thoroughly enjoy NECESSITY IS... Two reasons:<br />First, Billy James is a good writer, but more importantly he is a good organizer.  His task was to take historical events and present them in a coherent manner.  He decided NOT to present this history in chronological order per se, but rather he addressed key events from different perspectives.  The events are not necessarily in chronological order. It is an unusual way of organizing one's thoughts, but it works.  He must be applauded for his creative way of organizing his thoughts.<br />Second, he examines each single historical event by getting perspectives of several people involved in the event.  Its a fascinating excursion into the study of human behavior.  In most cases, different people see the identical event in a contrary manner.  In some cases, the conflicting descriptions are quite humorous.<br />Others who have harshly reviewed this book have missed the point.  This is a book of perceptions.  It is not an objective assessment of reality.  It doesn't make any difference if the interviewees were frustrated or delirious.  James provides a fresh perspective.<br />In addition, James answers some questions that cannot be found elsewhere.  For example, I have often wondered how Zappa could include Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (bubble gum singers from the Turtles) in the Mothers of Invention.  In chapter six, James lays out all the events.  An impressive job of pulling together quotes and ideas!<br />NECESSITY IS...

It is an excellent resource for legislators and policy.  The book includes 36 short chapters (5 to 10 pages) that provide a comprehensive review and/or analysis of cutting edge issues related to assessment and/or treatment.  Although these chapters are short, they are comprehensive.<br />The various authors in this volume make use of the current literature to identify causal relationships associated with successful treatment. Chapter 19 entitled \\"Anger Treatment with Offenders\\" is an excellent example.  In addition and perhaps more importantly, we begin to see typology development.  For example, in chapter 23 entitled \\"Adolescent Sexual Offenders,\\"  Hudson and Ward begin to identify characteristics of offenders which are critical in predicting successful treatment.  An important policy question emerges, \\"Should we focus on treatment for offenders who have the highest probability of success?\\"  Chapter after chapter provides convincing arguments that intervention is \\"better than nothing.\\"  The question is, \\"Are these better results worth the expenditure?\\"  Hollin addresses this critical issue as well.  Chapter 3 entitled, \\"To treat or not to treat? A financial perspective\\" by Cohen offers a decision-making model.  The major strength of this book is that little is left out or forgotten.<br />Three additional patterns within this volume merit discussion.  First, and most obvious, the authors consistently lament the lack of research.  Although they do not offer an explanation, the reason is unmistakable.  The arrogance of the 1970's reduced funding for such research. I suspect that if  Martinson's paper had been given less credence, criminal justice intervention would be much more advanced.<br />Second, in terms of intervention, we see the concept of \\"thinking patterns.\\"  In virtually all types of offenses, there exists a need for intervention to induce changes in the manner in which offenders conceptualize their world.  There are, of course, many exceptions to this, but the focus of therapy needs to be placed on thinking patterns of the offender.  More research needs to focus on strategies of such patterns.<br />Third, nearly every author contends that a professional with experience must perform assessment and intervention.  Although their plea makes sense, one problem is that not one single author operationalized the \\"experience\\" required.  This point is the only frustrating aspect of the entire book.  What type of experience and how much experience are needed?  What kind of educational foundation is required to make the experience useful?  Where can these experienced professionals be found?  In providing an assessment, one must have insight into the reliability and validity of psychometric instruments employed for making decisions regarding the rehabilitation strategies for offenders.  How much knowledge and experience are required? No author addresses these critical issues.<br />\\"Comprehensive\\" is the single best word to describe this fine monograph.  However, as I read I found myself seeking out two treatment concepts that were never addressed.  First, we see a plethora of research on the negative influences and consequences of watching television.  It would be interesting to learn if constantly watching films with positive moral themes would have a significant rehabilitative effect on inmates.  If such research has been completed, Hollin did not report it.  Second, with the recent notoriety of Hong Kong's judicial caning and Hollin's wish to be comprehensive, it is surprising that no author addressed the recidivism effects of caning.  Data from the Internet suggest that caning is abhorrent, but little to no research has be completed on the behavioral consequences of it.  We simply do not know the social consequences of caning.  With the international list of authors, it is surprising that no one addressed this issue.<br />A minor flaw in this book is that it ends abruptly.  Hollin did not include a summary or conclusions chapter.  Such a chapter would have been helpful, but this lack does not detract from the overall quality of this impressive work.  In general, Hollin provides a most comprehensive volume.  Every institution of higher education that offer degrees in law, criminal justice, social work, policy and rehabilitation should adopt this excellent monograph.do not know the social consequences of caning.

I like his novels and seek him out.  He is a brilliant writer.  His mastery of the word puts readers on the edge of their chairs.  He constructs a good story and knows how to tell it.<br />A PAINTED HOUSE is different.  Although he employs his well-honed mastery of the English language, I didn't like the story.  This is not to say A PAINTED HOUSE is a bad story.  It simply is not what I expected from Grisham.  Two issues in particular: First, I was expecting a lawyer to appear on the following page.  However each page I turned, the lawyer never showed up.  The Chandler family could have used a lawyer.  Well, may be not.  Second, there are many loose ends and unanswered questions with this novel.  Some people like that, I'm not one of them.  I found the ending annoyingly abrupt.  However, if there is a part II to A PAINTED HOUSE, I will be first in line to read it.	2001-05-13

THE LAST PRECINCT is the second in a series starting with Cornwell&#8217;s BLACK NOTICE...Both of these novels demonstrate Cornwell's crafty use of English and her ability to play on the emotions of her readers. She has the rare skill of inducing discomfort in the mind of the reader. She remains a talented writer.<br />Two points I need to make -- plus one warning:<br />One of the harsh criticisms directed toward THE LAST PRECINCT is the 70 (or so) pages of psychotherapy between Kay and Anna. As someone who was trained as a psychotherapist, I found the dialog particularly annoying. While reading this dialog, the following thoughts popped into my head: \\"Cornwell, what are you doing to me?\\" \\"What does this psychotherapeutic dialog have to do with anything!\\" Yes, I too was annoyed. Yes, the dialog seems disjointed and out of place within the context of the story. HOWEVER, (and here's the warning I promised) I bet the psychobabble provides a significant element within the third novel of this series. Cornwell, if you're reading this, don't let me down. Some will read the 3rd (yet to be named) novel for no other reason other than to discover how Cornwell ties Scarpetta's mental health into the resolution of the Le Loup-Garou storyline.<br />My second point deals with the Jaime Berger character. Initially, I thought Berger's actions were totally unbelievable. No prosecutor would ever consider the path that Berger took. With premeditation she deceptively violated Scarpetta's constitutional rights. As I read it, I thought, no prosecutor could get away with this. So, I asked a retired federal prosecutor about Berger's outrageous actions. Much to my shock, Berger's action in the novel represents the normal course of how prosecutors \\"set up\\" defendants prior to a grand jury hearing. In fact, he gave me examples of how he employed Berger's strategy in a bombing case he successfully prosecuted in Northern District of Texas. It's so unbelievable, it's believable. The bottom line is, Cornwell really did her homework for THE LAST PRECINCT.<br />...This is a good story. However, be prepared to read the third in the series.s, Cornwell really did her homework for THE LAST PRECINCT.<br />...This is a good story.

Each shows a different dimension of the same person.  COSMIK DEBRIS is unlike the two because it provides greater technical details.  For example, Russo provides the greatest degree of information regarding the business and artistic aspects of Zappa's life and musical history.  He shows how classical artists had an impact on Zappa's musical proclivities, but explains historical linkages based on the artistical/musical techniques.  For years, I've been attempting to explain Zappa to a friend in Maine who is a classical pianist.  I don't think she understood me until I gave her some passages to read from COSMIK DEBRIS.<br />COSMIK DEBRIS provides an important dimension into the understanding of this artist that none of the other books do.  It is more technical than the others are.  However, and most importantly, it is a critical addition to everyone's Frank Zappa library.	2001-04-23

First, James McManus seems to have great insight into womanhood.  My female friend who recommended this novel agreed.   In this respect, the book is artful and ingenious.   The internal talk within the main character is utterly fascinating.   Second, McManus has a rare command of the English language.   He is able to put words together that creates such a vivid portrayal of the characters, they do NOT appear to be fictional.  Reading this book is more like watching a movie.  McManus creates pictures in my mind.<br />Now, I don't like many of the outcomes that happened in the book.   I suspect my uneasiness is related to McManus vivid writing style.   I would describe many passages in the book as \\"unnerving\\" and \\"distressing.\\"   McManus' writing can put the reader on edge.  You're not going to like it, but you won't be able to stop reading.<br />At the beginning, I had a great admiration for the heroine, Penny Culligan.  I was astounded with this disabled woman's courage.  My admiration for her grew stronger and stronger by each passing page.   However, in the end I felt \\"let down.\\"   She chickened out!   But then again, after some reflection (and this book WILL make you reflect), it couldn't have ended any other way.  My admiration was renewed.	2001-04-06

I immediately found and purchased a copy from the out-of-print section of amazon.com.  I am so glad I did.<br />Stuart offers a very unflattering portrayal of Ogden's wife Frances.  She appears like an exploitive, mean-spirited person.  After reading Ogden's letters to her, it is obvious that my interpretation of Stuart's biography is grossly inaccurate.  Frances Nash is a quiet person who was devoted wife and mother.  I suspect that Stuart misinterpreted her shyness as being aloof.  As I read Ogden's emotionally intense letters, I can easily see how a shy person would be reluctant to share her inner feelings with the general public.  I understand that Frances' letters (her replies) have been destroyed.  This is sad.  If I could speak to Frances Nash, I'd ask her to read DATA SMOG by David Shenk.  She would be assured that the most private place to store her letters is in a public place (i.e., Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Purloined Letter\\").<br />I love our age of information technology.  However, because of it we have lost the art of letter writing.  Email is not the same as receiving a letter from the US Post Office.  The elegance of Ogden's passion for Frances would have never reached its intensity via email.  If you want proof, read EMAIL: A LOVE STORY by Stephanie D. Fletcher.<br />Nearly 700 letters were written to Frances.  This equals one letter every 2 ½ days when Ogden and Frances were apart.  Most interestingly, the passion found in Ogden's letters did not waver after they were married.  These letters are delightfully charming and heart warming - even for a cynical person.  Reading Ogden's letters can help one restore faith in humanity.	2001-03-31

David Walley third and last edition of NO COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: THE SAGA OF FRANK ZAPPA was published in 1995.  After reading the 1st edition in 1972 (hot of the press) and in the spirit of \\"Absolutely Free,\\" I immediately gave my copy to the organist of a rock band called The Last Rite (well known in Columbus, Ohio at the time).  He, of course, was delighted and still has the book.  Thus, when I saw the 3rd edition availabl, I immediately purchased it.  However, this time, I won't give it away.<br />If you are like me, when you read this SAGA, you'll get flashbacks to your youth.  It's a great book for those of us who want to remember the 60's and 70's.<br />\\"The more things change, the more they stay the same\\" is a truism that hits the reader right between the eyes.  I was stunned when I realized Zappa's freedom of speech struggle did not change over his entire life course.  It is a book filled with paradox.  Although the serious theme of freedom of speech is found in the book, it includes much to make one giggle.  I read the entire book on an airplane and caught myself laughing aloud.<br />I enjoyed reading NO COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: THE SAGA OF FRANK ZAPPA just as much as I did the first time.	2001-03-31

It noted that THE LAST PRECINCT is conceptually linked to BLACK NOTICE.  So, I went to order a copy of BLACK NOTICE on Amazon.com.

Yes, I read it long ago but forgot I did.  However, unlike many of the readers, I throughtly enjoyed this work.<br />I've read at least 8 of Cornwell's books and BLACK NOTICE is far from her worst effort.  For example, I think BLACK NOTICE is a much better story than HORNET'S NEST.<br />I would be interested in reading more about what others think of BLACK NOTICE compared to Cornwell's &quot;Judy Hammer&quot; series.  In deciding if I should take the time to read a book, such comparisons are helpful for me.  I hope it's helpful to you.	2001-03-31

Winick does not include a preface in THE RIGHT TO REFUSE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, it is obvious that the appropriate audience for this book includes judges, lawyers (both defense and plaintiff), psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and counselors. THE RIGHT TO REFUSE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT can be best described as a comprehensive assessment of the decision making process regarding involuntary clients, patients and, of course, prisoners.  With 20 chapters divided into three sections, it offers a significant contribution both to law and to clinical mental health intervention.  The sections include:<br />* Mental Health Treatment Techniques (seven chapters) * Constitutional Limitations on Involuntary Mental Health and Correctional Treatment (eight chapters) * Evaluating and Implementing the Right to Refuse Treatment (four chapters)<br />Winick is an excellent writer!  Regardless of one's discipline (law or mental health), one will find this book a worthwhile asset in one's library.<br />When Winick initially introduces a complex legal concept in one chapter and the same concept must be introduced later, he employs one of two effective strategies.  He either writes a summary of his earlier work or he cites where the reader can find more details of the legal concept.  This strategy is critically important and useful for this type of book.  For example, many people will not read this monograph from cover to cover, but rather read sections that are needed to achieve a necessary goal for a client. Winick's artful style is particularly beneficial for this type of reader.  In addition, the index is excellent!  It includes both a \\"table of authority\\" (cases) and a subject index.  These indexes will be extremely useful for readers seeking to resolve a problem related to involuntary treatment.<br />Mental health practitioners will be most impressed with the four chapters in Part III.  Here Winick systematically evaluates the right to refuse treatment, and he does an exceptional job of synthesizing the ramification of court ordered or coerced intervention.  Simply stated, involuntary treatment does not work well.  Winick's lack of using mental health jargon is refreshing and most importantly  provides a rare insight.  This was my favorite section of the book.  It is directly applicable to the daily work of the clinician.  In the end,  the reader realizes that mental health research does not process a prototype of a successfully treated involuntary client.  Based on Winick's review and synthesis of literature, such a prototype may not be possible and mental health may need to refocus the direction of involuntary treatment research.  A sound conclusion from Winick's book is that we must begin to study the process by which a client/patient moves from being  involuntary to voluntary.  In other words, what can a mental health professional do to instill a desire to successfully complete treatment among court ordered clients?  This question sounds reminiscent of  Yochelson and Samenow's classic work on the criminal personality.  Perhaps we need to revisit and extend Yochelson and Samenow's research.use treatment, and he does an exceptional job of synthesizing the ramification of court ordered or coerced intervention.

First, she writes for women who have been sexual exploited by health care professionals.  Second, she writes for health care professionals.  She was a sexual victim of a practicing psychiatrist (also her professor) while she was a medical student.  Writing in two voices, one for professionals and one for laypersons, is an extremely difficult task.  Penfold is impressively successful in her endeavor.<br />My first  immediate and personal response was total disbelief.  Feelings are difficult to intellectualize, but I will make an effort.  The case illustrations are too bizarre and a professional  observer (one without an agenda) could easily interpret these client/patient complaints as being delusional.<br />A long list of questions plagued my mind during the entire duration of reading this well written book.  Most of my concerns have been left unanswered.  Most importantly, Penfold does not come off as a sympathetic figure, but rather as someone who should have known better and responded to her difficulty with greater immediacy.  The real problem with Penfold and perhaps all psychotherapists is that we possess sophisticated skills in employing rationalization to justify our mistakes and frailties to ourselves and others.  At the end, I remained frustrated because Penfold never had the guts to file a complaint, but claims she is able to shepherd her sexually exploited patients to do what she could not.  Her intellectual ability to explain her plight is eloquent, but nevertheless shameful.  I hate myself for these thoughts because they are classic illustrations of  \\"blaming the victim.\\"  In those circumstances, could I have done better?  I like to think I could, but realistically I do not know what I would have done.<br />The critical question is, if Penfold could not file a complaint, how can we expect our clients and patients to do so?  The bottom line is that most therapists (male and female) are going to have difficulty in believing these bizarre complaints.  However, here lies the saving grace of this book.  In the end, the reader will become a believer and more sensitive to the possibility of this type of sexual exploitation.  If Penfold's goal was to pressure health care professionals to be more considerate of the possibility of sexual exploitation among our peers, she has greatly succeeded.<br />Penfold offers a significant contribution to both health care professionals and victims of sexual exploitation from health care professionals.  She opens the door to the subject matter by scratching to surface of this problem.  Readers, professional and non-professional, will be left with more questions than answers, but I do not believe this feeling of ambiguity is a bad experience.  I strongly recommend this book to health care professionals who are on ethics boards and admissions committees of advanced training problems.  In addition, I think that professionals who come in contact with patients and clients who complain about sexual exploitation should recommend Penfold's book to them.

At the end, they appropriately encapsulated their presentation with  \\"The Hippopotamus.\\"  Their 10-minute offering had a surprisingly strong influence for years to come.  For example, I never understood poetry in my high school literature classes until \\"The Hippopotamus\\" induced me to read other of Nash's work.  My interest in Nash's writing prompted me to appreciate poetry in general.  I would have never survived reading T.S. Elliot's \\"The Wasteland\\" without the influence of Nash.  As a result (and 30 years later), I was excited to learn about David Stuart's THE LIFE AND RHYMES OF OGDEN NASH.<br />Anyone who has ever smiled after reading a Nash poem will enjoy Stuart's offering.  Stuart has a vivid writing style that might be considered overly sophisticated for a Nash biography.  Upon reading the first 10 pages, I thought the book was appalling shabby.  I soon realized the problem was not Stuart's writing, but Nash's early life.  His early life was uneventful (understatement)!  Nash's life becomes more interesting during his persistent courtship with his beloved Frances.  Stuart offers an unflattering portrayal of Frances.  With his lifestyle, the reader will wonder how Ogden was able to remain devoutly faithful to her.  He was.  Frances wasn't a \\"witch,\\" but might have been a word that rhymes with it.  Frances' personality and influence on Ogden will remain undocumented.  I get the impression that she is still alive, but was not interviewed as part of Stuart's research.  In addition, Mrs. Nash requested that the Curtis Brown collection be unavailable to Stuart.  Perhaps all of Ogden's dirt is housed with Curtis Brown collection?<br />Readers under the age of 30 might find sections of this biography difficult to follow.  Today's generation of poets use a word processor.  I doubt that Ogden ever saw one.  Yet, the word processor has had a profound effect on the composition of poetry.  I wish Stuart would have addressed or described Nash's writing process.  Nash didn't have a database to seek out rhymes as today's writers.  In addition, younger readers will have difficulty in understanding poetry payments and cost of living during and after the Great Depression.  A footnote about the value of the dollar during Nash's life would have been most helpful.<br />David Stuart's THE LIFE AND RHYMES OF OGDEN NASH is a wonderful contribution.

In addition, younger readers will have difficulty in understanding poetry payments and cost of living during and after the Great Depression.   A footnote about the value of the dollar during Nash's life would have been most helpful.<br />David Stuart's THE LIFE AND RHYMES OF OGDEN NASH is a wonderful contribution.   Anyone who likes Nash's work will thoroughly enjoy this volume.	2001-01-14

She is a great writer. Even non lawyers can understand the central message.<br />&quot;You can't judge a book by its cover&quot; is an old adage that may NOT be applicable with Sexual Harassment in the Workplace: Law and Practice. A colleague lamented to me about sexual harassment she was facing from the medical director of the clinic where she was employed. During our conversation, I suggested she merely place Conte's work on her desk. It is black, but the title is in gold lettering with a fire engine red background. Thus, eyes are drawn to it because it stands out. Like others who entered her office, his eyes were drawn to Conte's volumes sitting on her desk. The harassment stopped. Hiring a lawyer and filing EEOC reports are costly, time-consuming, and emotionally draining. Strategically placing a book on her desk was not, and may have been more effective than filing a complaint.<br />As I said before this is a well-written book that will assist law and policy students. I think anyone who reads this review should ask their local public library to purchase a copy of this fine work	2000-12-26

I have never read any of Blume's work and was impressed with her ability to portray the characters' feelings with the written word.  She is a crafty writer in more ways than one.  If you read this book while on a plane, you'll forget where you are.  Blume's writing will enable your mind to leave your body and join Caitlin and Vix in their life adventures.  HOWEVER, beware of the ending.  It took me by surprise and filled me with emotion which is OK, but not in an airplane -- sitting next to a stranger.  I was embarrassed.	2000-10-31

CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL is the third in a series of three novels with an angel theme. If you're reading this review, you have probably read the other two: ANGEL FIRE and ANGEL LIGHT. I thoroughly enjoyed both of these novels and have recommended them to my friends.  My friends who have read these novels have enjoyed them.  Although ANGEL FIRE and ANGEL LIGHT are wonderfully written books, CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL is even better!<br />Why is CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL better than the two other angel books? Greeley, a splendid author and a master of the written word, takes a creative twist within these pages. He turns the story of Faust on its head and pursues many unexpected turns and jolts. Greeley's crafty writing skills can be found in all his other books, but CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL has more than witty writing, it includes the unexpected. It's a great book.	2000-10-27

Two essential points must be made.<br />First, the  intended audience of this monograph is criminal justice students.  Schmalleger thought that students could learn court and legal concepts by  employing the Simpson trial.  This is a brilliant strategy.  For example,  students will learn and will not forget concepts such as \\"evidence,\\"  \\"direct evidence\\" and \\"circumstantial evidence.\\"<br />Second, when one is  finished reading this book, one will understand why OJ was found not  guilty.  The reason is simple, but not obvious.  Much of the book includes  court transcripts.  We actually read the exact words of the lawyers and the  judge.  This is the real eye-opener.  OJ did NOT win because of the \\"race  card.\\"  He won because his lawyers (F. Lee Bailey, Johnnie Cochran, Robert  Shapiro, Alan Derchowitz, Carl Douglas, Peter Neufeld, Barry Scheck, and  Gerald Uelmen) were much more competent than the prosecutors (Gill  Garcetti, Marcia Clark, Christopher Darden, and Hank Goldberg).<br />Reading  the transcript is much better than hearing the words.  With the written  word, the reader has an opportunity to analyze the sentence structure and  understand the power of the words being used.  Simply stated the defense  were better orators than the prosecutors.  The defense had command of the  English language and the prosecutors did not.<br />My conclusion from  reading this book: If OJ had an all white OBJECTIVE jury, he would have  been acquitted.  It was not the evidence; it was the manner in which the  evidence was presented.  Evidence was presented within the context of the  spoken word and the prosecutors -- particularly Christopher Darden and  Marcia Clark -- were seriously lacking.<br />There are many other books  written about the OJ Trial.  These include &quot;Without a Doubt&quot;  by  Marcia Clark and &quot;In Contempt&quot; by Christopher Darden.  The  central theme of these publications is \\"blaming.\\"  Neither Clark nor Darden  would take responsibility for their incompetence as prosecutors.<br />Another book by Vincent Bugliosi is entitled &quot;Outrage: The Five  Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away With Murder.&quot;  Bugliosi also  includes transcript pieces, but interjects his opinion.  Schmalleger has an  opinion but does NOT share it with the reader.  He forces the reader to  come to his or her own conclusion: OJ didn't win, Clark and Darden lost.Marcia Clark and &quot;In Contempt&quot; by Christopher Darden.

In addition to our sexuality course, I use data from The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States for  my courses in Social Statistics and Research Methods.  I note the  importance of employing random sampling by contrasting this data to data  collected found in Shere Hite's The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of  Female Sexuality (#06963).<br />The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual  Practices in the United States is clearly a scholarly book.  The authors  also published a volume for the general public entitled: Sex in America: A  Definitive Survey.  This title includes nearly the same information.  However, it is much more readable, but doesn't included all the scholarly  details.<br />At this point in time, it is not likely that readers can find a  more comprehensive study on human sexuality.	2000-02-13

I didn't like the first 10 pages.  It's what my female friends would call a &quot;chick&quot; novel.  At any rate, after about the 10th page I became  mesmerized by it.  Woodiwiss' writing is so vivid, I forgot I was reading a  book and felt more like I was watching a movie.  For example, I found the  description of the cuts, pain, and healing of the leg irons so vivid,  pictures emerged in my head.  I found much of the novel like that.  Kathleen E.

US	51662980	R3LXERISOMWC7W	0471163139	274185879	2: Sexual Orientation and Legal Rights	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Review	As a social work program director for 22 years, I have been concerned at the number of homophobics who want to be social workers. &quot;Strange,&quot; I think, &quot;don't these people understand that they  will have homosexual clients.&quot; I explain to our applicants, &quot;you  cannot escape from seeing homosexual clients.&quot; The homophobics who  want to become social workers are faced with two enigmas. First, as social  workers, they must anticipate that some will be homosexual and are  ethically bond must treat them as any other client. Second, would-be social  workers must respect the legal and social rights of homosexuals to become  social workers.<br />Recent litigation involving the Council on Social Work  Education (CSWE) has made screening homophobic students complex. To  oversimplify the issue, CSWE mandated an admissions policy that prohibited  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Many Christian  institutions that desire CSWE accreditation actively prohibit the  admissions of homosexuals. Based on a series of constitutional and federal  regulatory standards, CSWE may not exclude these Christian institutions  from accreditation -- even though these institutions violate accreditation  standards. Herein lies the immediate importance of Conte's Sexual  Orientation and Legal Rights. She clearly explains it all! As a reviewer I  can say that any social work educator who is concerned or perplexed by  CSWE's decision to allow these Christian institutions to be accredited,  must read Sexual Orientation and Legal Rights. ALL the legal answers lie  here. In addition and most importantly, Conte thoroughly addresses all  aspects of sexual orientation and the law.<br />With a total of 24 chapters,  Sexual Orientation and Legal Rights is a comprehensive two volume set that  addresses legal issues related to sexual orientation. Volume I is divided  into four sections. They include:<br />Overview (3 chapters)<br />Employment  Discrimination: Law and Practice (9 chapters)<br />Specific Employment Issues  (3 chapters)<br />Family Law (8 chapters)<br />&gt;From basic curiosity, social  workers would be driven to read the chapter entitled, &quot;Gays in the  Military&quot; (from the section entitled, &quot;Specific Employment  Issues&quot;).20<br />In volume II, the continued Family Law section is  followed by the final section, &quot;Statutes and Case Law by State.&quot;  In reviewing Sexual Orientation and Legal Rights, it is clear that social  workers will be most interested in the Family Law section which includes  chapters entitled:<br />Family Law<br />Same-Sex Relationships: Marriage and  Dissolution<br />Child Custody and Visitation<br />Adoption<br />Alternative  Reproduction: Artificial Insemination, Sperm Donor, and  Surrogacy<br />Financial Implications of Same-Sex Relationships<br />Domestic  Partnerships<br />Housing and Property Rights<br />In addition, the final  section, &quot;Statutes and Case Law by State&quot; should generate great  interest among social workers and attorneys. For each state and Washington  D.C., specific laws related to sexual orientation are introduced. Then  Conte summaries prominent antidiscrimination statutes and elements of  sexual harassment; interprets regulations, assesses judicial dispositions  regarding sexual harassment. She then reviews case law under the following  topics:20<br />Adoption<br />Adult adoption<br />Alimony<br />Assault<br />Attorney  sanctions<br />Breach of employment<br />contract<br />Citizen  initiatives<br />Constitutional  claims<br />Contracts<br />Credit<br />Custody<br />Death<br />Defamation  (criminal)20<br />Discharge<br />Dissolution<br />Divorce<br />Domestic  benefits<br />Domestic partnership<br />Domestic partnership<br />Domestic  partnership benefits<br />Donor insemination<br />Education<br />Emotional  distress<br />Employee handbooks<br />Employment<br />Employment handbooks<br />First  amendment<br />Foster care<br />Foster  parenting<br />Guardianship<br />Housing<br />Insurance<br />Intentional infliction of  emotional distress<br />Interference with contractual relationship<br />Labor  arbitration<br />Marriage<br />Negligent infliction of<br />emotional  distress<br />Negligent supervision<br />Polygraph  examinations<br />Privacy<br />Property distributions<br />Sexual  harassment<br />Supplemental jurisdiction<br />Taxes<br />Tortious interference with  an employment contract<br />Transsexualism<br />Unemployment  compensation<br />Union<br />Wills<br />Worker's compensation<br />Wrongful  discharge<br />Conte emphasizes the importance of this chapter for attorneys  when she writes (page 131, Volume II): &quot;Although generalizations may  be made regarding state antidiscrimination statutes and state court  treatment of common-law claims, the nuances of state law may render a  particular litigation strategy feasible in one state and inappropriate in  another.&quot; For social workers, this chapter provides the foundation for  an effective policy change tool at the legislative level. Contrasting  various state laws is a well-known successful strategy that induces state  legislative committees to introduce legislation.<br />Several positive points  can be made regarding Sexual Orientation and Legal Rights. First, Conte  writes well. Writing style is a critical aspect of these volumes. Although  the volumes were primarily written as a legal reference, social workers are  likely to employ these important volumes as much as lawyers. They are not  saturated with legalese as one would expect. The bottom line is that these  volumes are readable and comprehensible to social workers. Second, Conte is  a well-organized and highly skilled legal researcher. Readers (social  workers, attorneys and judges) can feel confident regarding the validity of  Conte's legal assertions. Third, and most importantly, there is no  published legal volume that is commensurate. Sexual Orientation and Legal  Rights stands alone. One will not find a comparable monograph.<br />The  strengths of Conte's work have important implications for social work  education. For example in the most recent accreditation standards, CSWE has  added several curricula areas. In particular, social work programs (BSW and  MSW) are required to address &quot;Human Diversity&quot; and  &quot;Populations-at-Risk.&quot; Sexual orientation is included as an area  of required study under both of these curriculum areas. Even Christian  schools are mandated to address sexual orientation issues in their  curriculum! Thus, Sexual Orientation and Legal Rights is the ideal  reference item for all accredited social work programs. BSW and MSW  students are likely to write term papers on homosexuality. Conte offers the  only reference on the legal and regulatory dimension of sexual orientation.  As a result, no social work or law library in the United States should be  without it.<br />Although I have submitted a glowing review of Conte's work,  there is a down-side. It is best articulated in Conte's own words (page  ix):<br />.historically gays have lived in constant fear of the discovery of  their sexual orientation and the possible ramifications. Law steps in, in  theory at least, to offer peace of mind. This book offers the theory and  the reality in seeking equal rights. Society is fickle; minds that operate  collectively one day are splintered on the next. Attorneys must be vigilant  and prepare for constant change. Constant change is the problem.  Researchers seeking cutting edge answers to social justice issues will not  be able to rely totally on Sexual Orientation and Legal Rights. However,  Conte and the publisher resolved this problem by composing and publishing  annual supplements. Cutting edge legal and regulatory changes will be  available. Without supplements, the rapidly changing law and regulations  would make Conte's two-volume work problematic. Most importantly, Conte  maintains her high standards of sociolegal research and synthesis in these  critically important supplements.<br />The most frustrating aspect of Conte's  work is its publisher. Originally, Wiley Law Publishers produced these  volumes. The Wiley Law Publishers was sold to Aspen Law and Business  Publishing. As a result, adopting these volumes for one's academic library  is cumbersome at best. Aspen Law and Business does not include this  important work on their web page with their other publications. At the time  of writing this review, purchasing this important Sexual Orientation and  Legal Rights is complicated. To resolve the ordering problem, reassure the  librarian that although Books in Print indicates that Sexual Orientation  and Legal Rights is published by Wiley Law Publishers, it is not. Aspen Law  and Business is the publisher.<br />In summary, Sexual Orientation and Legal  Rights is an exceptionally well written reference for students of law and  social work, practicing social workers, attorneys and, of course, judges.  Conte's ability to successfully write for such a diverse audience must be  applauded. Sexual Orientation and Legal Rights and its supplements are  one-of-a-kind and a necessary reference tool for law and social work  libraries.stands alone.
