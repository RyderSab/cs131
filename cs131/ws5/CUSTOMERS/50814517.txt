Besides having descriptive (i.e., old, non-algebraic) notation, the puzzle collection suffers from numerous other problems.  The positions often appear composed rather than naturally occurring, and no credit is given regarding who created the puzzles to be solved.  Further, the print quality of the diagrams is sub par, which means that solving the problems straight from the book isn't as easy as it should be.  Overall, this book is quite a disappointment.  I recommend that you pick up another tactics book for middlegame or endgame practice.	2005-09-11

Some of the ideas in this book are very worthwhile guidelines for the tournament player.  I especially like the suggestions regarding modified piece values in various situations.   My chief criticism of this work involves the unnecessary repetition of ideas that have been merely reworded from one \\"rule\\" to another. For example, once the author has stated that \\"a knight on the rim is dim,\\" there's no need to mention other rules that cover poor knight placement on the edge of the board. <br /> <br />Further, a few rules have contradictory rules elsewhere in the book.  For instance, Alburt lists the rule \\"don't exchange pieces with a patzer.\\"  Yet another rule states that beating a patzer becomes easier if you bring the game down to an endgame.  How does one move into the endgame without exchanging pieces? <br /> <br />Finally, a few of the chess maxims are little too rudimentary; they resemble Fred Reinfeld comments (e.g., \\"develop your pieces quickly\\").  I think these detract from a perception of the book  as one for advanced players. <br /> <br />Since I consider a book worth the purchase as long as I glean one or two good ideas from it, I still recommend this book -- just if it's purchased at a bargain price, not the list price.	2005-06-18

Written with a minimum of jargon, this book will be of use to clinicians who practice standard psychotherapy and those who have more thoroughly integrated hypnosis into their practice. Hypnotic Techniques, the companion volume to the acclaimed Handbook of Hypnotic Inductions, introduces a wealth of hypnotic applications for dissolving resistance and moving ahead in therapy. Broad in scope and flexible with respect to theoretical bases, this new work by Gafner and Benson assists clinicians in bringing the power of hypnotic techniques to bear in an extensive variety of therapeutic contexts. How do therapists establish a directive in traditional psychotherapy? In the first section of Hypnotic Techniques, the authors explain how to set up a task for a client by the skillful use of hypnotic language, supported by \\"seeding\\" the intended target ahead of time and buttressing it afterward with metaphor, story, or anecdote. Story construction, embedded suggestion, metaphor development, mindfulness-based group anger treatment, ego-strengthening, and combining direct and indirect techniques are among the many topics addressed that borrow from hypnosis and are widely applicable in standard psychotherapy.    Therapists are encouraged to \\"think hypnotically\\" -- to look for junctures in therapeutic sessions where hypnotic techniques are applicable, to select the most appropriate technique, and to discern and understand the client's response to the applied technique. The aim is not to make clinicians into hypnotic therapists but to show all clinicians the efficacy of specific hypnotic techniques in the context of their current practice. In the second half of Hypnotic Techniques, the authors address formal hypnosis in depth. Beginning with an examination of the limitations of evidence-based treatments for clinical problems such as anxiety and mood disorders, relational problems, and anger, as well as for medical problems, chronic pain, and habit control, Gafner and Benson propose a collection of alternate, hypnotic means. Many of these techniques can be used in isolation from standard evidence-based treatments, while others are designed to augment standard treatments.    Weaving dozens of stories and therapeutic anecdotes into rich clinical vignettes, the authors demonstrate such techniques as \\"short-burst\\" and metaphorical ego-strengthening, the uses of amnesia and other hypnotic phenomena, alternating stories, unconscious problem solving, and exposure-based and indirect hypnotic applications in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the hurry-up world of managed care, Gafner and Benson find that hypnotic techniques are particularly valuable because they require a slower pace in initial sessions when creating connections to both the conscious and unconscious minds of clients. Somewhat paradoxically, by moving slower and establishing bonds to the conscious and unconscious, resistance is more effectively overcome and both therapist and client move ahead more steadily toward the therapeutic goal. These techniques will help traditional psychologists, as well as those well-versed in hypnosis, as they seek to dissolve resistance and assist their clients in the therapeutic process.	2004-12-15

The authors start each chapter explaining a problem and then showing how a given implementation or two isn't flexible.  Then the text presents a design pattern and shows how to use it and how it solves certain issues.  Along the way, the reader is given general design ideas to keep in mind while architecting or refactoring a system. <br /> <br />Because key concepts are repeated throughout the book using different phrasing and examples, I found learning/reviewing each pattern to be straightforward and easy.  I haven't used Java since '98, but with C# skills I found the code examples fairly simple to understand. <br /> <br />Also note that this book doesn't explain in detail all the patterns explicated in the Gamma et al. text.  Instead, you will learn the Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Factory, Singleton, Command, Adaptor, Facade, Template Method, Iterator, Composite, State, and Proxy patterns will full explanations and code examples.  Other patterns (e.g., Bridge, Builder, Chain of Responsibility, etc.) receive only a brief overview in the back of the book.  The authors feel that those patterns aren't used as often and consequently necessitate less coverage. <br /> <br />If you're looking for no-nonsense writing that delivers design pattern facts in a most direct manner, then choose the original Gang of Four Design Patterns book instead.  But for a much friendlier introduction and explanation of patterns, pick up Head First Design Patterns right away and use Design Patterns by Gamma et al. as a reference.  Highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2004-11-22

I would expect college graduates to know many (if not most) of these words.  And wordsmiths will probably recognize all but one or two of the terms.  I think the GRE exam that I took over 10 years ago had more challenging vocabulary.   <br /> <br />The usefulness of this title, however, comes in its format.  The flash card pages enable the reader to review/learn vocabulary in a quick and easy manner.  Sample sentences and phonetic spellings are provided as well.  While the author's phonetic system is a bit inconsistent, it's probably easier for the average reader to understand than the more scientific IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet). <br /> <br />If you regard words such as augur, engender, vociferate, and stultify to be outside your recognition vocabulary, then this title might be just the right one for you.  I also recommend any book that uses mnemonics to facilitate word/definition recall.  <br />	2004-10-18

But if you want to be able to build and consume web services without using generated code, or you need in-depth knowledge of how web services work at the code level, then this book is a winner.  I've given it only 4 stars because it's a little out of date now.  I wouldn't buy Ballinger's book just for WSE information since at least one newer book is available on using WSE 2.0.  But to get a strong grasp on the specifics of web services and their implemention and extension, this title is an invaluable resource.	2004-10-12

When I read this book years ago, I found the information therein just as the title states: fascinating.  But upon further perusing of this work, I began to notice incorrect information presented as fact.  For example, the deer botfly does NOT fly at the stated high speed; that fanciful notion came from a quote by etymologist Charles H. T. Townsend.  His absurd estimation was proven false by Irving Langmuir.  <br />I've also found information in this book that contradicts &quot;facts&quot; elsewhere in the book.  And the statistics cited from years ago are often out of date and inaccurate.  I recommend this title only if you are willing to verify some of its information against other sources and have a keen ability to distinguish between fact and fascinating fiction -- however plausible it might seem.	2004-07-18

His tips are not always those found in other books on Photoshop or digital photography.  For example, Ken recommends slightly underexposing all photos you shoot.  Too much light, he explains, can wash out details.  But if the subject is slightly underexposed, then lighting can be adjusted in Photoshop without loss of fine details.  That's a very useful tip that I had not read anywhere else (in my PS books, at least).  He also affords readers sufficient photographic evidence to convince them to use RAW format whenever possible. I shoot in RAW mode all the time now.  <br />Not all of Ken's techniques will be new to digital photographers.  The need for a fill flash, uncluttered backgrounds, and a good photo printer are ideas that seem a bit incongruous in a book offering much more advanced advice in later chapters.  I think the author was just trying to target as broad of an audience as possible.<br />Upon reading this solid guide, you will probably notice Ken's preference for 3rd party plugins/filters.  He's the first Photoshop author I've read who so strongly advocates the utilization of  extra plugins instead of the direct use of Photoshop's built-in technologies.  While Scott Kelby would tell you to add a duplicate layer, apply Gaussian blur, and then reduce opacity to accomplish a given task, Ken touts the power of $200 plugins that accomplish the same goal more quickly and sometimes more effectively.  Fortunately, comparison photos are often provided to illustrate the differences between the results of Photoshop techniques vs. 3rd party plugins.<br />Overall, this book is worth owning if you would like some useful tips and tricks from a pro.  Just keep in mind the author's bias toward 3rd party products, and expect a few sections on topics that are perhaps too elementary for the rest of the book (e.g., &quot;Take Good Care of Your Printer&quot;).	2004-04-24

Chapters 1-3 are rudimentary in that they explain the different types of server controls (html controls vs. web controls, and user controls vs. custom controls).  Towards the end of chapter 3, however, you get into the real work that pays dividends. You create a custom web control that inherits from System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBox.  Great stuff!  Then the authors provide a quick overview of design-time attributes since these are found in the automatically generated code when creating a new web control library.<br />The remaining chapters, 4-14, are progressively more advanced and discuss custom control state management, adding events to your controls, data binding, mobile controls, validation, and design-time support (among other topics). You gradually learn how to create very sophisticated custom controls that reduce your need for any 3rd party components.  This book is simply a must for anyone serious about leveraging the power of inheritance to implement very useful - and ultimately time-saving - custom controls.<br />The authors also explain concepts in a clear, straightforward manner and assume little regarding the reader's knowledge of controls.  Rob told me in person that he put a lot of effort into this book, and his hard work is evident by the quality of what's written in Building ASP.NET Server Controls.

But upon receiving the book, I noticed that almost all the code samples have no code-behind files.  The C# or VB.NET code is in the .aspx files along with the presentation layer code.  What in the world?<br />One of the key best practices for writing ASP.NET applications is this: separate the presentation layer from the rest of the code for the project.  ASP 3.0 applications, for example, suffered from having all the code mixed together.  Then when graphics guys would add their work, or when the presentation layer needed major changes, the rest of the ASP code (business logic, etc.) was affected.  Since ASP.NET offers a solution to this problem, why would this author provide all his code examples in .aspx files with non-presentation code contained therein?<br />I hope that beginning and intermediate developers who read this latest edition understand that the author was merely taking shortcuts.  Whether Walther was using Notepad or not to edit his source, he still could have utilized code-behind files for the  examples, thereby setting a much better example for more junior developers to follow.<br />My second but much less important complaint is that the code samples in the book are all in VB.NET.  One must refer to the CD to see the C# versions of the .aspx files.  <br />I recommend choosing a different ASP.NET book  -- perhaps one published by APress or O'Reilly.	2004-01-22

But if you have neither the old nor the new edition of this masterpiece by Scott Kelby, then rest assured that some of the included ideas are worth the price of the book itself. I wish I had known about these shortcuts to photo enhancement a long time ago. I find this collection of easy yet powerful tips to be even more useful than Photoshop 7 or CS Down &amp; Dirty Tricks (two other Kelby books I own and like). Work smart, not hard with The Photoshop CS Book for Digital Photographers.<br />I gave this book only 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that more new material should have been included instead of using so many techniques from the previous edition of this publication.	2004-01-08

But if you already have a trained memory and want to take your skills to the next level, then I recommend this title strongly.  O'Brien explains his DOMINIC system quite well in this work; now I understand why he uses people instead of only objects.  While I don't believe that a beginner would find the DOMINIC system as easy to learn and use as the Major System, I still encourage people to try both apporaches to determine which works best for them.<br />Dominic also expatiates on his language learning approach, offers mathematical shortcuts, and presents ways to memorize quotes and speeches.  Some great ideas based largely on the loci system can be found here.<br />In many ways I like this updated version of How to Pass Exams better than How to Develop a Perfect Memory, another book by O'Brien that I own.  Dominic has contributed some unique refinements to the field of mnemotechny, so I view his books as worthwhile purchases for any memory training expert and perhaps for a few mnemonics neophytes, too.	2003-08-30

Milton H. Erickson, M.D., arguably the greatest hypnotherapist ever, often utilized metaphors to achieve breakthroughs with his patients.  Now 100 Ericksonian metaphors are available for you to use with patients thanks to the Lanktons' Tales of Enchantment.  Each metaphorical story in this treasure trove is preceded with information regarding what the story teaches, problems addressed, and the target audience.  I highly recommend this collection of therapeutic metaphors for any Ericksonian hypnotherapist or individual who wishes to read stories that will effectuate positive changes in his or her life.	2002-11-05

Erickson often worked his &quot;magic&quot; by telling metaphorical stories to his patients.  The construction of such effective metaphors has sometimes been difficult for Ericksonian hypnotherapists.  Burns addresses this issue by affording the reader a collection of 101 therapeutic metaphors.  For each story, the problems addressed, resources developed, and outcomes offered are listed.  <br />Equally important is Burns' explanation of how to use these stories.  Reading a story verbatim from this book is less likely to be effective than telling a modified version of a story so that it is isomorphic with the client's experience.  Burns provides a list of do/don't reminders that are almost essential in enabling the reader to utilize therapeutic metaphors successfully.<br />If you enjoyed Tales of Enchantment, you will also love this excellent reference and instructional guide.	2002-10-18

They explain how to induce trance and the language patterns to use.  They also dispel some myths about hypnosis and discuss how we all go into trance every day -- while we drive, as we doze off, or when we daydream. I have seen copies of this book sold for $.  I still would not sell mine for so little money, for the value of the information therein is worth so much more.  If you wish to learn Ericksonian hypnosis, then I highly recommend this book to you.	2002-10-08

I do, however, wish that the authors had covered the power of the Loci system with greater detail.  It is utilized by world-class memorizers to set new records in memory competitions.   And the system I employed to set a new U.S. record in card memorization cannot even be found in this book.  All the other memory systems and techniques explained by Lorayne and Lucas are excellent.  In my opinion, as long as this book is not the only memory guide in your library, it will serve you very well.	2002-10-08

Though NLP is more advanced now and includes topics not covered in this book (e.g., Submodalities), Frogs into Princes will teach you about the power of NLP to transform people's lives.  You will get an overview of how NLP enables you to change your thoughts and emotions easily.  Buy it and open up a new world of understanding yourself and others.	2002-10-08
