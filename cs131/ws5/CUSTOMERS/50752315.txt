The main characters in this story are: Jack and Emily Tallis, parents of Leon, Cecilia and Briony Tallis; Aunt (Emily's sister) Hermionne's children Lola, and twins Jackson and Pierrot; Robbie Turner, the cleaning lady's son whose education is subsidized by Jack Tallis; Marshall, the chocolate magnate friend Leon brings home for the break.  <br />In the summer of 1935, 13-year-old Briony Tallis witnesses and misinterprets a scene that occurs before her between Cecilia and Robbie.  From a second story window of the house, she sees Robbie standing in silence while Cecilia undresses and goes into a fountain.  Later on, she opens a letter meant for Cecilia (with vulgar language used) and witnesses Robbie forcing Cecilia into a corner of the library.  From these events, she judges Robbie to be a dangerous \\"maniac\\".  During a search party for Jackson and Pierrot one night, Briony sees the form of person running away from an assaulted Lola.  Naturally, she immediately suspects Robbie to be the culprit.  Her testimony to the police and her family grew more certain with each telling, and pretty soon it was accepted fact that Robbie had committed the crime and should go to jail.  He does.  This was also around the time WWII was beginning, and the second portion of the book walks us through a few days in the life of Robbie as he tries to return home to England after being conscribed to fight in France.  The third portion of the book takes us five years from that summer where Briony has had time to mature and realize that Robbie was, contrary to what she thought, passionately in love with Cecilia and that Lola's attacker was also someone else she knew.  She knows she has done Robbie grave injustice and seeks to make amends with him and Cecilia (who has patiently awaited his return from war).  The fourth and final part of the book occurs more than fifty years later (1999) and reveals to us the truth behind Briony's search for Atonement.<br />One can easily anticipate the twistsand turns the author has laid out in the beginning of the book (Robbie grabbing the wrong letter, what Lola's scratch marks meant, Jack Tallis' constant absence from home).  The final section of the book, however, contains a shocker in its last 2 pages.  It was not the ending I was expecting.  But it does leave the reader thinking Briony will write another even happier draft for her \\"atonement.\\"  With each version of the story as part of the penance for her sin.<br />The prose is wonderfully crafted with vivid descriptions of everything from the Tallis home to the British retreat at Dunkirk during the war.  McEwan struts his literary prowess with his metaphors such as Emily's migraine as an all-consuming beast.  Truly enjoyable.<br />On a more personal note, I found it refreshing how McEwan was able to describe how simple love was back then.  How the foundation of an entire relationship could rest on an event as trivial as a bus stop kiss.  Yet be powerful enough to last and sustain one person through the darkest and grimmest days of war.  And how fierce loyalty to someone you love could drive dividing lines between a family.  This is the type of writing that's severely deficient in current bestsellers.<br />Memorable lines:<BR>* \\"I'll wait for you.  Come back.\\"<BR>* \\"My reason for life.  Not living, but life.\\"<BR>* \\"They had... while others sipped their cocktails on the terrace.\\"<BR>* \\"It is quite impossible these days to assume anything about people's educational level from the way they talk or dress or from their taste of music.

The only reason why I picked up this book was the gaudy banner on the top of the cover that says \\"From the author of The Ellen Rimbaur Diary.\\"  I happened to like that book (which was even the basis for a Stephen King mini-series on ABC earlier this year).  But I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Ridley Pearson's Daphne Matthews series is reminiscent of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels.  They're both psychologists working with police officers (Lou Boldt in Pearson's case and Milo Simpson for Kellerman) to help solve crimes or stop them before they happen again.  In my opinion, the author dwells too much on the psychological makeup of the antagonists in the story as manifested by Daphne's profile of them.  I understand that as a psychologist, it's her job to provide a possible motive for the actions of a suspect.  However, in terms of storytelling such lengthy characterizations of a person's frame of mind seemed a bit distracting.  Moreover, since I cannot verify the medical basis of such analyses I had doubt in my mind as to its validity.<br />In this novel, several things are going on at once for the trio of Daphne Matthews, Lou Boldt and John LaMoia.  A series of murders preceded by reports of a peeping tom, an accidental drowning in a shady part of town, and a floating corpse retrieved close to a bridge all demand the resources of the CAP (Crimes Against Persons) unit of the Seattle PD.  They are all pulled this way and that, but what happens in the end is like a rubberband snapping back to shape.  It's tense.<br />There's also a love triangle in this story between the three protagonists.  Lou and Daphne used to be lovers, but Lou has a wife and kids.  John and Daphne develop a chemistry from working together that spills into their personal lives.  John owes Lou and Daphne his life for saving him from his drug addiction.  We clearly see how each one reacts to one another when Daphne's life falls in danger.  She's attractive and smart (and clearly steals most of the story's limelight).  There's detective Prair (a former patient) and Ferris Wheeler (the brother of the deceased floater) also vying for Daphne's attention.<br />I found Pearson's imagination of Seattle's Underground (a name given to the city of abandoned buildings built over by the current one) to be quite intriguing with its hidden passages through church cellars, building basements, and bus tunnels.  He describes the darker side of Seattles drug-abuse shelters and the shady Chinatown district.<br />I do agree with another reviewer that the ending felt a little bit rushed.  With only 4 pages left in the book, the author decided to split them up into 2 chapters.  Each like a footnote of what happened to each character in the end.<br />Nonetheless, it was a very suspenseful book from the middle to the end.  I found it hard to put down once the pieces of the puzzle started to come together.  I had no idea who the killer was till the end.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<br />============================<BR>L (Language) - 4 (vivid descriptions of Pearson's Underground, well thought-out dialogue)<BR>E (Erotica) - .5 (description of the victims' state Underground)<BR>A (Action) - 2 (interrogation room drama, wire surveillance, rescue at the end)<BR>P (Plot) - 4 (seamless dovetailing of sub-plots into a coherent murder-mystery)	2002-08-27

The series starts out with the fast-paced, action packed Ender's Game, then moves on to the relationship oriented Speaker for the Dead.  The next book in the series is the preachy Xenocide and finally ends with the long winded, highly incredulous Children of the Mind.  As a friend of mine said, Card milked it for all it's worth.  In fact, the author created another series devoted to a character in a parallel timeline to Ender's Game.<br />What did I not like about this book?  The dialogue for the most part was horrible.  At any point in the story a character is bound to be giving a monologue on something.  Some characters speak and bicker like kids one moment and turn around and sound like psychologists with measured words the next.  This is really a story about Jane.  Ender's role as a provider, healer and source of strength ended with Speaker for the Dead.  It's too bad the author decided to leave the second and third books incomplete.  You really need to read this book to have closure on Ender's life.  But to read this book is to devote time and energy to a particulary limp and lame story.<br />Don't you miss the days of the award-winning Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead?<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 2 (did Orson Scott Card really write this drivel?)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)<BR>A (Action) - 0.5 (the launch of the MD device was probably as exciting as it got)<br />P (Plot) - 3 (let's save jane, see jane save herself, see jane save the rest of humanity, ugh...)	2002-06-03

But, learning the book's lesson about what the world would be like if one's individuality were lost, I'll say what I truly feel.  I think this book is slow and depressing.  In fact, the only reason that I kept reading on was because of the introduction of Julia in the story.  I found her character intriguing.  Why was she put there?  Who is she?  Can her motives be trusted?  It was only after I read the story, that I realized she was created by the author for the sole purpose of being used as a barometer for Winston's (the protagonist in the story) individuality.  What Julia means to Winston is an indication of how much Winston has lost of himself.  His ability to think and remember the past.<br />In 1984, the world is divided into 3 superpowers.  Winston belongs to the Ingsoc Party (a contraction of [Eng]lish [Soc]ialism) where to have thoughts in opposition or in deviance with propaganda meant capture and subsequent brainwashing by the Thought Police.  Everyone in the Party is watched and monitored by telescreens (two-way TVs that broadcast as well as receive) and hidden microphones.  A new language called Newspeak is a rapidly decreasing subset of English created to make the expression of rebellious thought an impossiblity.  On top of this, all books and works of literature were being rewritten in Newspeak and their essential meaning contorted to serve the purposes of the Party.<br />If George Orwell's vision of the future haunts you, then his objective was achieved.  His main goal in writing this book was to both set a mood and give a warning.  The mood he sets is for what an extreme Socialist state would look like twenty years from the time he wrote the story.  His warning is of what would happen if Socialism were perverted by the ruling class where power becomes an end and not just the means.<br />The ideas presented in this book are powerful and well thought-out.  However, the story itself is dull and uneventful.  If you like a story that you can read and reflect on afterwards, this is your book.  If you like faster-paced stories, pass on this one.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<br />============================<br />L (Language) - 3 (humorless, basic English dialogue)<br />E (Erotica) - 0.5 (go Julia go)<br />A (Action) - 0 (n/a - goes hand in hand with the story being dull)<br />P (Plot) - 3 (dull story, good vision)	2002-05-20
US	50752315	R3J5QK1IG1UKPM	0140254501	27674487	Bombardiers	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Ingenious...	I read this author's second book The First $20 Million is Always the Hardest first.  I really enjoyed that novel as it involves characters I can relate to in an industry I'm in (high tech start-ups).  Naturally, I was a little apprehensive about reading this novel as it centers on Wall Street and bond trading.  I'm not a business person, but this is my reaction after reading the book:<br />A lot of the banking concepts such as bonds, savings and loans, securities I didn't fully understand.  But kudos to the author for structuring his prose in such a way that the specifics of bond trading is not important in moving the plot forward.  It's the characters and their personal ideosyncracies and relationships with one another that grip the reader.  The pace of the novel can only be described as frenetic, like a movie that incessantly cuts away to scene after scene every couple of minutes.  To have an author that is able to provide the reader with a 360-degree panoramic view into the heart and life of an industry while at the same time satirizing it is pure genius.<br />As a quick summary of the story: Sidney Geeder is the king of mortgages.  He's the best bond salesman Atlantic Pacific (AP) has.  He's also a couple of months away from retiring rich with stock options.  Sid's hatred for the bonds he sells is what drives him to be the best.  At the same time a new kid named Mark Igino (aka Eggs Igino) joins the company.  Egg's is a natural salesman and also somewhat of a renegade for not having been exposed to the house rules of AP.  As expected, Eggs turns the place upside down.  Sid and Eggs quickly form a friendship (more like an alliance).  Naturally, AP wants to control its employees, and how it does it is the focus of this story along with a supporting cast that'll keep you grinning till the end.  Truly engaging!<br />The author has an uncanny talent for humor in the subtleties of each character.  A statement as absurd as \\"he lost his job because of his need to floss\\"generates complete empathy on the part of the reader after reading through this novel.  I would recommend this book to any person with any background.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 4 (well-crafted dialogue keeps your mind off the technicalities of bond trading)<BR>E (Erotica) - 1 (let's just say, bond salesman have fun too)<BR>A (Action) - 0 (n/a)<BR>P (Plot) - 3 (fairly predictable ending, it's the characters that are important)	2002-05-12

I picked up this book when someone had mentioned they were required to read it in school as children.  This book is about the end of innocence and the heart of darkness.  Ok, before you get scared away by the two phrases I just mentioned, let me explain.  So without even reading the book, you probably know it's about a bunch of English schoolboys who get stranded on an island and are forced to survive without the supervision of adults.  This book is supposed to be full of symbolisms; each character and animal represent some idea or entity in society.  The end of innocence I mentioned begins with the slaughter of a pig for food.  The heart of darkness comes when the leader of the hunting tribe loses his mental stability and decides to hunt for more than just pig.<br />It's actually a very short story (208 pages), and the dialogue is very simplistic.  I found the author's descriptions of the jungle, beach, lagoon, and mountain to be quite boring.  (You'll also notice that I said schoolboys in the last paragraph; there are no girls in this story.  There is no underlying love story.  There is no humor.  There is no excitement whatsoever.)<br />To be honest, I don't like this book.  Even less so as required reading for school kids.  To not interpret the symbolisms would be to leave the book as a plotless story.  Yet to interpret it would mean exposing children to the horrors of savagery, abuse and survival.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<br />============================<br />L (Language) - 3 (You can put as much interpretation as you want in the &quot;symbolisms&quot; of this book, but I'm too lazy to let my mind wander in search of a deeper meaning.)<br />E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)<br />A (Action) - 0.5 (You really can't get excited over a bunch of schoolboys and a few pigs.)<br />P (Plot) - 2 (Boys get stranded, boys form a society, boys survive and wait for rescue.)	2002-05-07

Well, the author did warn us in the preface of Speaker for the Dead that Xenocide was going to be more philosophical and slow than his first two books of the Ender series.  (Perhaps that's why this book didn't win the Hugo award that year.)  The book's ending is set up for the fourth and last book in the series - The Children of the Mind.  (The reviews I've read on it are less than positive.)  This book deals with a wide range of issues such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, faster-than-light travel, interspecies tolerance, martyrdom, separation, etc.  It's no wonder this book seemed long preachy.<br />Here's what I really think about this book.  I hated the ending.  It's a ... ploy for the reader to buy the fourth book.  The rest of the book was so-so, a LOT of dialogue and positing.  And since all of the technology presented in this book is fiction, it's highly incredulous.  <br />Plotwise, nothing really exciting happens in this book.  It picks off from where Speaker for the Dead left off.  (It's like that movie Contact with Jodie Foster.  Did she really travel to space or was she just [imagining it]?)  The sources of conflict in this book are the same: the descolada, Lusitania fleet, Novinha's family, Valentine.  I'll keep you posted on the last book.  But I'm not getting my hopes up.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 3 (blah blah blah)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a - sigh)<BR>A (Action) - 0 (n/a - can you believe this?)<BR>P (Plot) - 2 (\\"we need to figure out what to do with the descolada\\" <- pretty much sums up the story)	2002-05-02

I was warned that this book was meant to be a parody of Communism (whatever that means).  I'd like to think of it as a nice fable with a sad ending.  But I can't escape the fact that it is overtly a criticism meant to poke fun at the Communists in Russia.<br />&lt;random thought&gt;I felt really bad for Boxer.  The horse that has a white stipe down his nose making him look stupid (these were the words the author used).  Here's someone with a steadfast character and a determination that if only he worked harder things would get better.&lt;/random thought&gt;<br />&lt;aside&gt;Only after reading this book did I come to understand how ignorance and illiteracy could lead to abuse and oppression.  I grew up in a country that was colonized by the Spaniards for over three centuries.  During this time, the Spaniards made sure none of the natives learned how to read or write.  They feared that once the natives learned what was going on around them, they would rebel.  And indeed they did.  That was the smartest thing they ever did.&lt;/aside&gt;<br />The author remarks, in the original preface in the appendix section of the 50th Anniversary illustrated hardcover edition, how the USSR took a good political ideal such as Socialism, and twisted it to an abomination that's worth mockery.  Indeed, George Orwell has even fought in a Spanish war to defend Socialism.  This was when he took a bullet through the neck and lived to write about it later on.<br />I can see why this book is a classic.  It's short, easy to read, carries a powerful idea and applies to more than just Communism.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<br />============================<br />L (Language) - 4.5 (very well written, clear and concise)<br />E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)<br />A (Action) - 2 (deaths do occur)<br />P (Plot) - 3 (not really a plot heavy story)	2002-04-22

In my opinion, The Diamond Age provides characters that are richer, more human and that the readers can understand and relate to better.  Take Nell for example.  I felt bad for her when people treated her unfairly, and cheered her on along her quest to free her brother.  And Harv, Nell's brother, what brother wouldn't want to protect, teach and provide for a younger sister when all they've got is one another?  John Hackworth is touted as a nonotechnological genius, but I thought that for him being a good father was more important than inventing some grand device.  Lord Finkle-McGraw I can picture as the benevolent-yet-mischievous grandfather every person would love to have.  I could go on and describe each and every character in this book and someone they remind me of in my life, but I won't :).<br />The Diamond Age envisions an extreme and futuristic world where all facets of life revolve around nanotechnology.  This future world isn't one happy world.  In fact, most of it is downright depressing.  People are differentiated depending on what phyle they belong to.  Beggars and thetes (people who don't belong to a phyle) line the streets.  There is no privacy out in the open.  Everything is watched.  Punishment in the form of caning exists.  Death by remote control is possible.<br />It is, however, an incredible world as well.  Almost any object from clothing and food to entire floating cities can be created using a device called a Matter Compiler (MC for short) that obtains its source of materials (atoms) from Feeds (think of these as huge pipes that tunnel through major cities).  <br />This is the world that Nell, the main character and a thete, grows up in.  Her life would've been inconsequential and she ignorant were it not for a book (entitled A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer) her brother gave to her.  This book, the Primer, is a wonder of nanotechnology and advanced enough to adapt itself to Nell's surroundings and circumstances in life.  It teaches her everything from reading to self-defense. The Primer is not merely a device though.  It also enables ractives (interactive movies) to be shown.  From interacting with the Primer... Exciting stuff!<br />The many plot twists are sure to captivate readers from beginning to end.  Perhaps even make the reader want to reread portions of the book to see how brilliantly the plot comes together.  \\"Wow!\\" was what I said as I put down this book.  I'm sure you will too.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 4.5 (incredible descriptions of Stephenson's vision of the future)<BR>E (Erotica) - 2 (some abuse)<BR>A (Action) - 3 (nanotechnology plays a big role in the action)<BR>P (Plot) - 5 (so many sub-plots that dovetail to a cataclysmic ending)	2002-04-17

In keeping with my personal philosophy of exposing myself to different literary genres, I picked up a copy of Snow Crash -- a cyber punk novel.  It's a different experience when you start out.  You're not sure whether you're missing some background information or a special dictionary to go through the book.  It starts off at a fast pace and uses words like Burbclaves, Franchulates, Kouriers, pooning, loglo, etc.  Our protagonist is called Hiro Protagonist, a pizza deliverer for the Mafia-controlled pizza chain Cosa Nostra, who also happens to be a hacker supreme in the Metaverse and greatest sword fighter in the world.<br />Did you do a double take on what I just said?  If you did, welcome to the world of cyber punk.  If you didn't, welcome to the world of cyber punk.  The author has to lay down the groundrules of his &quot;future world&quot; while at the same time using that as a foundation to tell a story.  (Everyone's vision of the future is different.)<br />This novel will be very different from the others you've read.  It is erratically paced.  The action scenes from riding a skateboard to sword fighting are exciting and fast.  The scenes in Hiro's office figuring out the mystery of Snow Crash with the Librarian is slow and sometime downright boring, preachy and dull.  The plot is really simple.  Once the dynamic duo of Y.T. and Hiro determine what Snow Crash is, the rest of the plot is predictable.<br />The seemingly self-contradicting characters in this novel alone make it worth reading.  Y.T. has real spunk.  Her attitude is that of a typical carefree 15 year old rebel.  She delivers packages on her hi-tech skateboard while keeping it a secret from her mom (a government programmer).  Her dialogue is true to her character.  Hiro is at times a curt, savage and indifferent person, yet at other times a loquacious, compassionate and loyal friend.  His dialogue and actions display both extremes.  Raven is described as Asian, but in reality he's a giant thug.  There are many other characters that complete the book.<br />Two weeks ago, if you asked me whether I'd pick up another cyber punk novel again I would have answered no.  But lo and behold, I'm finishing up The Diamond Age by the same author, and I thoroughly enjoy it so far.  Look for my review to come.<br />All in all, I did enjoy this novel.  It was a great intro to the world of cyber punk. <br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 3.5 (Hiro wavers, Y.T.'s a blast)<BR>E (Erotica) - 2 (one scene sticks out)<BR>A (Action) - 4 (pooning, katana-wielding, Reason)<BR>P (Plot) - 3 (simple, just complicated by cyber punk lingo and the &quot;future&quot;)	2002-04-14

This book is a random collection of short stories by Haruki Murakami, translated by two people.  Most people who read stories that have a definite plot (with a beginning and an end) might find the stories in this book slightly unnerving.  The author does a great job of building up the plot to a climax and has an annoying tendency to just end it there or have the story eventually go nowhere.  Almost none of his stories have a resolution or denouement.<br />A couple of the stories I liked are:<BR>* The Perfect Girl<BR>* Family Affair<BR>* A Slow Boat to China (particularly the third section about the second chinese in)<BR>* The Elephant Vanishes<br /><random thought>I find it curious that of the millions of names the author could have chosen for some of his characters, Noboru Watanabe is used twice.</random thought><br />The other stories are just borderline fantasy and ramblings.<br />The translations are crisp, clear and colorfully written.  I'm sure it does the author's original work justice.  The author writes in the first person voice for all the stories.  Sometimes, the protagonist is male, sometimes female.  Most of the stories have the protagonist as a married person.  Almost all of them come to a realization that their spouses aren't perfect and they hate them.  None of the wives ever have a name.  In the stories where the author writes in the voice of a bachelor, he always has a steady girlfriend and other acquaintances to have sex with.  Every protagonist drinks beer and smokes.

The author begins this book with his reasons for writing this book.  He credits this book for the novelette version of Ender's Game, which until that point was only a short story.  He had to rewrite this story from scratch several times over because he kept getting stuck with what to do with Novinha's children.  The very first version he wrote didn't give them any character.  They were there not to advance the plot, but as stubs for a family.  He later realized though that the cornerstone of the story had to be Novinha's children.  I really thought that bestowing Miro, Ela, Quim, Olhado, Quara and Grego with personalities of their own would just confuse me.  But it didn't!  The fact that I can name them off to you without referring to the book and have some brief description of each in mind shows you how memorable the author has made them.<br />What keeps the reader hooked on this book is the mystery of why Pipo and Libo get killed.  The author slowly trickles this information to the reader with clever document excerpts from research logs, official ansible messages, etc. on top of the daily activities of the key characters.  Ender, the original Speaker for the Dead and writer of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, is called for by Novinha to speak Pipo's death.  However, as far as star travel goes, 22 years will have gone by before he reaches Lusitania.  In the meantime, Novinha has given birth to her 6 children and has reneged on her call for a speaker.  Right before Ender arrives, Libo is killed and Marcao (Novinha's husband) dies from a genetic defect.  Miro and Ela each call for a speaker as well to speak respectively for their deaths.  So, in effect, Ender is there to speak for 3 deaths.  How the story unfolds truly is surprising and shocking.  It kept me wondering.<br />This is a very different book from Ender's Game.  Both of these books are enjoyable for entirely different reasons.  Ender's game was a lot more \\"earthly\\", had more action and described the world in the eyes of a child.  Speaker for the Dead starts off on another planet and leads the reader on a path of discovery through the eyes of a family.  It deals heavily with emotions, human interactions and communication.  This book has a very strong religious backdrop.  From the whole notion of Lusitania being a Catholic-licenced settlement, to the structure of their society and customs.  The three literary conflicts that can exist in a story between man vs. other men, man vs. himself and man vs. his environment are present in Speaker for the Dead.  The taboo of adultery, murder and incest are also mentioned.  On top of this, the author also manages to make this a work of fantasy.  The author describes another alien race with their own way of life.  To be able to pull all these together in a coherent and compelling story, truly is talent.<br />I highly recommend this book if you enjoyed Ender's Game and find the concept for a Speaker of the Dead interesting.	2002-03-26

I haven't had this much fun reading a Silicon Valley culture book since Jerry Kaplan's Startup.  It's very well-paced and easy to follow.  I loved it!<br />La Honda is a research center staffed by \\"ironmen\\" (the author's term for hard-core engineers) who want to design and build the latest and greatest technology (not for the money, but for the pride and thrill to be the first).  At the time the story starts, the latest and greatest was a processor called the 686 (a spoof on the Intel Pentium's successor).  Francis Benoit is the lead designer for this chip.  Ever since the beginning, he's had a grudge against Omega Logic (a chip maker that sponsors several of La Honda's projects including the 686) for \\"dumbing down\\" his previous chip (the Falcon).  He had designed the Falcon to be exponentially faster than its predecessor and capable of doing parallel processing.  But because of business reasons, Omega only used one of the two chips being shipped with every system while charging a higher premium.  That made the world think Francis wasn't able to deliver what he promised.  He will stop at nothing to make sure this never happens to him again.<br />Andy Caspar is the main protagonist of the story.  He's an ex-employee of Omega, and a new employee at La Honda.  All his life, he's wanted to develop software, but his first project was to do testing.  He exelled at this.  Naturally, when he had a chance to work on the 686 he quickly jumped in only to be talked down by Francis to work on another project (the sub-$300 machine) to guarantee him another year at La Honda.  Little does he know that what he thought was a hopeless project would end up forcing him (and his three other teammembers) to part ways with La Honda and try to start up their own business.  That's where this story gets interesting, and sheds light on the way Silicon Valley people work and think.  <br />This book shows what a dog-eat-dog world really exists in the realm of entrepreneurship.  You can never trust anybody to truly mean what they say.  Some people are master-manipulators and think it's the most natural thing in the world.  Yet others, like Andy, need time to absorb all that's being done to him and fight back.<br />The author has imbued Andy with a realism that endears.  He's sensitive, caring and smart, yet not perfect.  He's a good talker, but he's fairly gullible as well.  Each of the other characters - Darrel, Salman and Tiny - are just as human as well.<br />If there's one negative comment I could make, it would be to say that I wish the author pursued just a tad bit more the romance between Alisa (Andy's neighbor) and Andy.  They're a cute couple.<br />As the other reviewers have mentioned, this story pokes fun at the concept of Network Computers (sub-$300 PC) and the Java programming language (write-once-run-anywhere programs - the \\"Hypnotizer\\").  Don't let these concept overwhelm you or scare you into thinking this might be a book about technology.  It really isn't.  You don't need to know anything about computers to enjoy this book.  At the core, this book is about relationships.  The author does an outstanding job of revealing each character's vulnerabilities without diluting the plot.<br />I highly recommend this book!<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 4.5 (the interactions between each of the characters is what brings this book to life)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (a slight hint of romance between Andy and Alisa)<BR>A (Action) - 0 (n/a)<BR>P (Plot) - 4 (Francis Benoit did have a grand plan for how it was going to be played out, or does he?)	2002-03-22
US	50752315	R2O30GEAWSX7W0	0345426266	955062554	The Analyst	Books	4	0	4	N	N	Not bad...	The title Analyst is kind of misleading.  When I picked up the book and saw the blurred outlines of a man and a train, I figured this would have something to do with a financial analyst, you know, the Wall Street type.  Even though this book is mainly set in New York City, it's about a psychoanalyst (a shrink).  (I didn't even know this type of professional exists.  I've heard of psychiatrists and psychologists, but never psychoanalysts.  It sounds like one of those bogus professions like tarot card reading.)<br />So, Dr. Frederick Starks (Ricky) is a psychoanalyst that receives a threatening letter on his 53rd birthday telling him to find out the true identity of the letter writer (signed Rumpelstiltskin) within 15 days or risk losing his patients and relatives.  To show that Rumpelstiltskin means business, one of his patients commits an apparent suicide by jumping in front of a train.  At the same time, Ricky starts to understand how much control Rumpelstiltskin has over his life, his bank accounts, his relatives, his identity.  It's a race against time for Ricky as his every move is anticipated and thwarted.  It seems hopeless.  Ricky could end the game at any time by taking his own life.<br />Without giving away the plot, let me just say this story is divided into two sections.  Let's call it the Old Ricky and the New Ricky.  In the Old Ricky, Dr. Starks lives a really dull, predictable and mundane life.  In the New Ricky, he turns into a character right out of a Robert Ludlum novel.  We're talking about Ricky displaying spy-type characteristics and instincts.  To be honest, it bothered me a little.  The author made no mention and gave no inkling what abilities, talents and hobbies the Old Ricky had to justify the stuff he did in New Ricky (hence my comment for the P rating below).<br />This story is not as fast paced as I would like it to be, but the plot is original.  I hope my rating system below will help you decide whether or not this is a book you would like to read.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 3 (all the characters take on the tone of the psychoanalyst, each thought is clearly articulated, not much variation)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0.5 (one totally unnecessary flashing scene)<BR>A (Action) - 2 (two tame action sequences at the end, a lot of going around town searching for clues and meeting people)<BR>P (Plot) - 3.5 (interesting, but characters are not fully integrated into it)	2002-03-19

This is the first Mars/Venus book in the author's series of books that I've read.  I have heard several good things about the original book Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus.  Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, and I purchased a copy of this book.<br />I liked how the author was able to coherently build a framework to explain the differences between men and women.  His analogy to interplanetary species having to co-mingle here on earth struck me as original and humorous.<br />There were, however, certain aspects of this book that are a bit disappointing to me.  Whereas I agree with most of his points, I wish the author would have included more real world examples and scenarios.  In 290 pages of text, only 3 examples were given as to how effective this framework could be. <br />The book's recurring theme and lesson is that men and women basically misunderstand each other because they come from different planets where customs and traditions vary.<br />The book is full of 2-3 column charts on what men and women should or shouldn't say at certain situations.  It attempts to explain what is going on in the mind of a woman as a result of what a man does or says, and vice versa.  It also offer remedial dialogue for what to say when a \\"misunderstanding\\" is about to occur.<br />Another point the author drills into the readers mind is: Men are quick to arrive at solutions whenever a woman approaches him with a problem, not knowing that this is her way of including him in her world and a way of leading up to her solution.  It states, half a dozen times throughout the book, that women share their emotions with men in the workplace not as a way of putting blame or soliciting advice, but rather a way to make an emotional connection.  Men, on the other hand, view this as a sign of weakness and a waste of time.  The author terms men as Mr. Fix It because men seem to always quickly offer a solution not fully hearing out what a woman has to say.  Believe it or not, that was the single most important takeaway of the whole book.  Each chapter repeats a variation of this lesson.<br />Toward the end of the book, the author crams in a chapter about sexual harrassment.  Why it occurs (based on his framework of interplanetary misunderstanding) and what can be done to relieve or tolerate it.  I do think the topic of sexual harrassment in the workplace is relevant, but I felt it was glossed over.<br />The second to the last chapter is devoted to essentially two checklists: 101 Ways Men can Empathize with Women and 101 Ways Women can Empathize with Men.  And there really were 101 items on each list.  This struck me as odd because it reminded me of a little book called Life's Little Instruction Book by H. Jackson Brown <ASIN: 1558534903>.  It had suggestions like compliment her hairstyle, offer to bring her a glass of water, carry around a family photo in your wallet, etc.  It just seemed really odd to me that this would be included in this book.<br />(I'm curious as to whether this book stemmed from the author's workshop materials or the other way around.  Maybe this book is the summary of his specialized courses to institutions.)  Either way, I'm afraid I cannot recommend this book because what the author has spent almost 300 pages trying to explain, I can capture in 3 paragraphs.	2002-03-11
US	50752315	R3K8ZCEKCIKDQD	0812550706	401439625	Ender's Game (The Ender Quintet)	Books	5	358	405	N	N	The Epitome of Science Fiction	This was a book recommended to me by a friend who also happened to tell me the ending before I read it.  Remind me to give him a nasty stare!<br />Anyway, this book starts off with a rather long introduction which the author wrote himself about his influences and motivation for writing Ender's Game.  The author has had the idea of a Battle Room since he was sixteen.  Only much later did he piece together the story of Ender and his mission to save the earth.  <br />Ender Wiggin is a special boy.  He is the youngest (6 yrs old when the story starts) of a family of child geniuses (Peter being the eldest, then Valentine).  This story is set in the future where aliens (called Buggers because of their physical and mental traits) have tried to invade the earth twice.  Twice the Earth defeated them, but at great cost.  The government is scrambling to make sure this never happens again by training the next set of star fleet commanders from childhood.<br />In this futuristic world, only the government could sanction the birth of a third child (for population control reasons).  In a way, Ender was born for a purpose.  Peter and Valentine were both tested for giftedness and they both possessed it; however, he was ruthless and evil, and she was too soft and kind.  Ender was a perfect balance of decisiveness and innocence, and so chosen from the beginning to go through Battle School.  It is in Battle School that Ender learns military strategy and the history of wars between the Earth and the Buggers.  It is also in Battle School that Ender makes friends and molds the perfect platoon leaders.<br />What's really unique about this story is that Ender is forced to grow up so quickly by the \\"adults.\\"  The teachers of the school and high government officials all have one thought in their minds.  And that is to eliminate the alien threat at all costs.  Even if it means sacrificing the health and sanity of a child.  Ender is subjected to so much isolation and abuse throughout the story,that I felt really bad for him.  He has to learn to think like an adult through the eyes of a child.  His biggest fear is becoming like his brother Peter (who, in Ender's eyes, is a cold blooded killer -- keep in mind that we're talking about the thoughts of a child who hasn't even reached puberty) is slowly becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy as he matures.  The ending of this story is just amazing.  I will not give it away!<br />I recommended this book to a 13 year old boy before having finished the book.  Now I'm thinking twice about my recommendation.  Although this book's main characters are children and centers around the premise that child geniuses will save the world, there are a lot of adult themes and references to ancient history that probably only an adult would appreciate.  I believe references to the Warsaw Pact, the League of Nations, Locke and Demosthenes will confuse the younger readers.  Also the themes of murder, deception, isolation, rules of engagement in battle might be viewed as inappropriate by parents for their kids.  With this in mind, I urge the reader to consider the maturity of the intended audience before recommending this book even though this is a terrific story.	2002-03-06
US	50752315	R13RNRJ8HBKPCY	0060987049	70030622	Microserfs	Books	3	6	11	N	N	Ramblings...	Though the journal-entry style of this book is refreshing when compared to other fiction books masquerading as reality, I find it hard to discern anything more than the generic ramblings of twenty-somethings in the hi-tech industry.  They talk about completely random things, such as what programs pet animals would write if they could.  Each character also voices their personal opinions on the purpose of life throughout the book.  These odd bunch of friends start their \\"lives\\" (in the real world) influenced by the Microsoft-cult-culture.  Their lives revolve around work (usually past midnight and even on weekends) and sleep (they all live in the same house close to \\"campus\\").  Naturally an event such as a close-friend's proposal to start up a new company and recruit them as \\"equity partners\\" (aka employees) throws them off balance and threatens the humdrum existence and pseudo-harmony they've come to expect as employees in Building Seven on the Microsoft campus.  That's where the adventure begins for these people.  Moving from Redmond to Silicon Valley, they set up shop in Daniel's parents' home in the Valley.  From here, the book turns into a coming out party of sorts.  Dan's dad is having a midlife crisis after having been laid off by IBM.  Bug comes out of the closet.  Dusty gets pregnant.  Michael falls in love.  All these happen while they're trying to come out with a product they can showcase in the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas.<br />This book is unnerving in some sense.  It is able to accurately capture what many people in the hi-tech industry are like -- their habits, propensities, worries and fears (even their \\"language\\").  But it falls short in certain aspects.  The storytelling was at times uncoherent and lacked a fluid story-telling aspect.  It got too bogged down with the philosophizing.  And at times, it felt like writing for the sake of writing.  I particularly disliked the ending however poignant.  My thoughts as I finished the final pages were\\"That's not fair to the reader!\\"  I was referring to the whammy of Dan's family tragedy.  I couldn't find any reason as to why that was added except to reinforce the randomness and cest la vie attitude of this book.<br />This book is so random.  If you like to read what \\"geeks\\" have in their minds, then this book is for you.  If you prefer to read a story with a real plot about what the dot-com world is like, I would highly recommend Startup by Jerry Kaplan instead.	2002-03-03

I really liked it then.  It was different and original.  How many stories have you read where the first few chapters are grossly misspelled and carry the tone of innocent child?  Almost 10 years later, I decided to revisit this story in its lengthened book form.  I love it even more.<br />Flowers for Algernon is a collection of progress reports, similar to diary entries, by Charlie Gordon.  Charlie [has an IQ of 60 and] works at a bakery when the story starts.  He is motivated to do what he can to learn how to read and write so that he can be smart like the people around him.  Through an evening adult learn-to-read class, Charlie is introduced by his teacher Alice Kinnian to Professor Nemur and Dr. Strauss, a psychiatrist and a neurosurgeon, respectively.  Nemur and Strauss are searching for a subject to perform an intelligence enhancing operation on, which up to that point has only been tried on a mouse named Algernon.  They pick Charlie because of his friendly nature and tenacity to learn.  The operation is a success and slowly Charlie's intelligence begins to increase.  He slowly comes to undertand the world around him.  Before when people laughed at him, he laughed with them and considered them his friends.  Now he realizes they were just making fun of him.  He's also slowly unlocking the repressed memories deep in his mind of his childhood and trying to understand them.  Why did his parents send him away when he was younger?  Why does Norma (Matt and Rose Gordon's second child of normal intelligence) hate her so much?  As Charlie's IQ increases he realizes that people around him aren't as smart as he thought they were before the operation.  Slowly he surpasses them in intellect until he begins to alienate himself from the people around him.  He is alone again.  There's so much more left to tell about this story, but I could never do it justice with this summary.  I would urge the reader to read for themselves and be moved.<br />Ultimately Flowers for Algernon is a very sad story.  And as the subject of my review states, I was reduced to tears.  In fact, the last two pages of this book unlocked a torrent of emotions I never knew a book could.  To me, this book is singular in that sense.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2002-02-26

But somewhere in between childhood and adulthood a curse was cast upon me.  I stopped reading.  I used to read all sorts of books when I was young (if Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys sound familiar to you, then you'll know roughly how old I am).  I read whatever I could get a hold of and it filled me with a sense of wonder and imagination.  Reading filled voids during the lonely times, and gave me something to think about during the happy times.<br />It's kind of ironic that a children's book should make me fall in love with reading again.  But this book did the trick.  From Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I slowly read the next book in the series, then the next and the next.  Each book got progressively thicker, but that didn't matter.  The stories come to life with humorous characters and this world of witchcraft and wizardry.  I was beginning to imagine again!<br />After reading the four books in the series, I said to myself \\"Hey, that wasn't so bad.  I wonder why I stopped reading.\\"  From that point on, I started with The Hobbit, then The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien.  Then I saw the movie trailer for The Bourne Identity which stars Matt Damon and I looked for the book it was based on.  That led me to explore the world of espionage and international conspiracies according to Robert Ludlum.  From here, I realized that I should probably balance my reading between fiction and non-fiction.  So I read Good to Great, a business book by Jim Collins (the author of Built to Last), Jack: Straight from the Gut (about Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE), Made in America (about Sam Walton...).  With a seamingly endless sea of titles to choose from and written by authors I did not know, I started one book at a time from each \\"famous\\" (atleast to the world around me) author.  I've read current books by John Grisham, Jonathan Kellerman, Sandra Brown, Carol Higgins Clark, Robin Cook, Tess Gerritsen, and many many more.  From this sampling, I've developed a sense of what I like and don't like.  I've discovered what \\"formulas\\" these authors use.  All this in a span of 5 months.<br />I don't even realize how caught up I get when I describe to my friends the books I've read and the books I plan to read.

To label The Velveteen Rabbit as simply a children's book would not do it much justice.  I've read this story many times over and have gotten friends and other family members to enjoy it as well.  I guess I wouldn't have related so much to this story had I not seen it unfold in front of my very eyes for the past 16 years.<br />Teddy, for my sister knew no better names for teddy bears at the time, is a two foot tall pink bunny rabbit my sister got when she was about seven.  At the time, Teddy was sitting on a shelf in a large department store looking out at the hustle and bustle of customers go by.  My sister must've gone by that shelf three or four times before asking a store clerk help her bring it down.  It was at that point that she decided she wasn't going to go home without it.  She clung on to Teddy's neck defensively while approaching mom as if Teddy was body armor she couldn't live without.  \\"But you have so many of them already!\\" protested my mom.  \\"This one is different,\\" pouted my sister.  Teddy is cotton-stuffed rabbit, covered with short yarn hairs of dull pink.  She wore a white-turquoise sweater that covered her round bushy tail at the back.  It was my sister's velveteen rabbit.  \\"Ok fine,\\" mom conceded.  From that day forward, I saw as much of Teddy as I have my sister.  They're inseparable.<br />As the Skin Horse in the book said \\"Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in your joints and very shabby.  But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.\\"  Teddy too has grown threadbare in places and isn't as fluffy as she used to be.  Her eyes have gotten dull from rubbing and scratching.  Her neck has grown thin and fragile, but my sister loves her all the same if not even more.  To my sister, Teddy was made real a long time ago.  It's only more recently that I've come to realize that Teddy has become part of the family.  My sister was right.  Teddy is different.  Different from all the other toys we've had in the past.  Teddy is real.<br />After reading this book, I realize that love is a journey.  Perhaps not one from make-believe to reality, but from belief to truth.  There are many ways to interpret the lessons from this book.  I have several.  And my take away has been if you truly believe in your love for someone and care about them, then in time it will become the truth that need not be spoken and will last forever.  Applied to life, if you believe so much in something that you are willing to stick it out regardless of what other people think, then it becomes the truth that most people never find in their lives.  If you have a dream, believe in it, work towards it and live it.<br />This is a timeless must-read for any reader.part of the family.  My sister was right.  Teddy is different.

US	50752315	R1J8ELXVIXRLJA	0385503822	782272714	The Summons	Books	3	8	10	N	N	So-so book...	A friend of mine told me about this book.  And since I wasn't fully satisfied after reading Skipping Christmas (also by John Grisham) I decided to give this book a try.<br />It's a story about the two sons of a judge in a small town of Clanton, Mississippi.  One son is the black sheep of the family (Forrest Atlee).  The other is a professor of Law in Virginia (Ray Atlee).  They get summoned one last time to Clanton presumably to discuss the will of their dying father (Rubeus Atlee).  When Ray arrives home first, he discovers their dead father and a cabinet full of money - $3 million worth.  Questions arise in his mind about where the money came from and whether he should tell anybody about it.  Forrest, no doubt, would use any money to stoke his addiction for drugs and alcohol.  So Ray decides to keep the money for the meantime.  That's where his adventure begins.  He goes around town trying to ascertain the authenticity of the money (they could be counterfeit).  He also tries to hide it from a stalker who seems to know his every move and how to scare the living daylights out of Ray (letters in the mail, break-ins into his apartment).  In the end, Ray decides he wants to have nothing to do with the money.  So what happens to the money?  You'll have to read the book (or e-mail me) to find out.  :)<br />The editorial review mentions Harry Rex (a long time family friend to the Atlees) as being the only character that \\"jumps off the page\\".  I too felt that Harry Rex was given more life to than any other character in the story.  At the same time, he's only in the background.  He's like the voice of reason for Ray (a la Robin Quivers for Howard Stern).  He's not pretentious, righteous or cocky.  He's down-to-earth, practical and helpful.  It's unfortunate that we don't see him more involved in the plot of the story.  With more characters like Harry Rex, this book would've been much better.<br />FLAP rating:<BR>F:0.0 (not a romance book)<BR>L:4.0 (easy to read, genuine dialogue)<BR>A:2.5 (no murders or fight scenes)<BR>P:3.2 (has a twist in the end)<br />(* For more information about what the FLAP rating means, please visit my About You section and look for my review on The Bourne Supremacy by Robert Ludlum.)	2002-02-18

I'm not even writing this review because I own it or reread it.  I'm simply writing this review because I cannot forget it.<br />I first read this book when I was about 6 or 7 and I kept thinking \\"I wish I had my own giving tree\\".  A companion that will remain with me for all time.  I thought of it as a happy story.<br />Now that I'm older and have seen more of life, I sometimes think \\"I have been that tree\\".  Then I realize what a sad and touching story it has become for me.  <br />The nice thing about this book, is that it is timeless.  It will hold meaning no matter what your age.  A reader may interpret the story one way or the other depending on how they've lived their lives.  Have they been the tree or the boy?<br />I would highly recommend reading and owning this book, for it captures the essence of living life, of giving and taking, of love.	2002-02-18

I was watching the news right after the premiere of Stephen King's Rose Red on TV on ABC, and I did see the mansion that this book was based on.  This house in Washington is currently a Bed and Breakfast, and occupants have said on more than one occasion that they have seen apparitions in the mirror that disappear the moment they turn their backs.  That truly would be scary.<br />I do believe the diary was very well conceived and written.  There are a couple of points that I thought made the authenticity of the diary hard to vouch for (and after reading the other reviews on this site, I have confirmed my doubts).  The first of which is the website for Beaumont University.  The keen reader would at once notice the .net IP mask of the URL address.  A real university would have a .edu ending.  The content on the website is also severely lacking in content and seem to one way or the other focus on Paranormal activities (even the Contact Us link and the courses offered).  (By the way, the missing excerpts are also hidden at the end of the Diary Excerpts section.  Go through all the missing excerpts at the end, and you'll find the \\"Missing Excerpts\\" link.  And since when have authors been demure enough to replace profanity with \\"(_ _ _)\\"?)<br />I usually also like to comment on the language and tone of the author as they write the book.  I noticed a very consistent way each entry was written.  It was written as if to be read and it flowed smoothly (maybe too smoothly).  I've personally kept a diary a long time ago and my entries in it were somewhat erratic and non-coherent.  I never have doubts as to whether \\"I should entrust this knowledge on to your pages.\\"<br />Upon watching the mini-series on tv, and the way they  marketed and advertised the book (timing was too perfect) I knew something was fishy.  There is also no credit for  a Dr. Joyce Reardon on the show, and the way she was portrayed (if she were a real person) was not very flattering either.  (The mini-series uses the book for its background information and flashbacks.  You can read the book alone and still enjoy the story.)<br />Nevertheless, I found this book to be quite enjoyable and would recommend it to the readers.<br />FLAP rating:<BR>F:3.0<BR>L:4.0<BR>A:0.0<BR>P:3.0<br />* For an explanation of what FLAP means, please visit my About You area and look for my review on The Bourne Supremacy by Robert Ludlum.	2002-02-11

The funny thing about this book was that I bought my very first copy on a trip to China when I was about eleven.  I don't know how many times I've restarted the book since then, but I never finished it until now.<br />This book is a semi-autobiography of a very famous physicist by the name of Richard P. Feynman (RPF).  I say it's a semi-autobiography because Ralph Leighton compiled and chronologically ordered several stories told to him by RPF.  And I say he's famous because he was a Nobel laureate and named one of Time Magazine's Most Influential People of the last century.<br />Anyway, RPF is as interesting a character as you'll ever hear about in the scientific community.  He looked to science to explain things around him even from a very young age (you'll learn more about his father's influence on him in the second book).  His father always taught him to question things that don't make logical sense.  He was an analytical person.  <br />Yet behind his intellectual prowess lies his desire to live life and have fun.  In this book, he recounts his fear of being called a sissy when he was young, his attempts at hitting on girls, cracking safes, doing magic tricks, learning how to draw and paint, playing in a samba band, etc.  Throughout the book, he talks about his motivation in doing such things.  He's not out to impress or tell a tall tale that's impossible.  In fact, he's quite down to earth and very frank.  He speaks what's on his mind.<br />Richard P. Feynman has led a very colorful life.<br />If ever there were a non-fiction book that's fun to read and even humorous at times, this would have to be it!<br />(* NB: There is a follow up book called \\"What Do You Care What Other People Think\\".  Also a collection of short anecdotes told by RPF to Ralph Leighton.  This \\"sequel\\" is a looser set of stories that don't chronologically fit together (oh, and there are also some pictures in the middle of this book).	2002-01-29

Instead, I'd like to focus on my impressions of the book.<br />* It felt like a long Acknowledgement list.  In it, Jack must have mentioned over 50 names who have in any way, shape or form have had contact with Jack.  He naturally puts all these names in the context of a story.  Perhaps this was his intention.  After all, &quot;Straight from the Gut&quot; could've been what he felt when he wrote a list entitled &quot;My Heartfelt Thanks To&quot;.  But after a few chapters and dozens of names later, I was completely confused about the timeline and relevance of these names.<br />* It most definitely is NOT a business book!  If it were meant to be a business book, I believe the reader will be sorely disappointed.  In this book, he spends a short chapter in the end recapping some of the principles he's stood by as chairman of GE that have made him successful.  I felt it was &quot;too little and too late in the book&quot; to have made any impact on the reader as a business book.<br />* It's not exactly a groundbreaking autobiography either.  Although I wish he had kept his tone in the first few chapters (while describing his childhood) for the rest of the book.  Those first few chapters were precious.  In it, Jack described how vulnerable he felt as a child.  What his family situation was like.  His motivations.  His sources of inspiration.  After he started work for GE was when the book started a downhill descent and never recovered.<br />* After reading the book, did I think Jack Welch was &quot;King of the World&quot; and &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot;?  No, he made mistakes along the way (professional as well as personal).  Did I learn anything from him?  Maybe (to surround myself with competent people).  Could this book have been better?  Yes (I wish he talked straight from the gut).	2002-01-29

I usually don't read other people's reviews before writing my own, so that there won't be a bias (and so that I don't self-censor myself).  But I happened to scroll down a bit too far, and the first entry in the review section mentioned that the NY Times says James Patterson can't write.  I found that interesting.  This is the first James Patterson novel I've read.  I realized that this author also wrote the novels on which the movies Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider were based.  And I found the movies quite entertaining.  I figured &quot;How bad can his books be?&quot;.  Anyway, enough of my ramblings and onto my impressions of the book.<br />I found the book to be an easy read.  Several chapters are only 2-3 pages long.  It starts off with one murder, then another one.  And another.  And, oh, did i mention there was another one?  I'm actually not trying to be funny.  He writes in a lot of deaths into this book to establish the cold-bloodedness of Michael and William who are vampires who love to kill.  Yeah, you got that right... VAMPIRES.  I had to do a double take when I saw what the plot was about to lead to (&quot;Is this an X-File?&quot;).  I almost instantly thought I had made a mistake picking up the book.  Thankfully, there's a brief introduction that vampirism itself is like an underground cult, nothing more supernatural than that.  I just turned on my suspension of disbelief for a while.  And that got me through the novel.<br />Naturally, since this novel is meant to be the sequel to Roses Are Red the Mastermind plays a major role in this story.  He taunts and annoys Alex Cross by calling him every day on his cell phone and at the most coincidential of times (when a death has occured).  Later on in the novel, it's revealed that the Mastermind is someone Alex Cross knows (I wouldn't want to completely spoil it for you.)<br />Throughout the novel, Alex thinks about his relationship with his past partners and his current one, Jamilla.  He obviously doesn't have time to fool around with Jamilla, although there's a lot of flirting going on.  There are times when I found myself saying &quot;Dammit, just get it on!&quot;  But he never got it on.<br />As to whether the reader should buy this novel or not.  I would say you should PASS.<br />FLAP rating:<BR>F:1.5 (He give it a try on the female victims.)<BR>L:3.5 (Simple safe dialogue that doesn't sound too fake, but doesn't emote any feelings.)<BR>A:3.0 (What can i say?

I only realize now after reading the description of the author on the last page of this book that she started out as a romance novel writer.  Was I in for a pleasant surprise!  I had been reading a string of action-suspense books from Jonathan Kellerman and Robert Ludlum the past few weeks.<br />In many ways, this book accomplishes what it set out to do.  Plotwise it's very simple.  It's about two identical twins who couldn't be more different from one another that switch places for a few days.  All hell breaks loose when a friend comes to visit Ann's fiance.  This friend falls in love with the ersatz twin, Allison, who is a socially awkward researcher in a lab.  In the end, this friend (Spencer) makes a woman out of her and gives her the most precious gift a woman could ask for -- a child.  There are of course the requisite last minute conflicts that hint at a bad ending, but the reader should note that Sandra Brown likes happy endings.  (She hasn't strayed yet.)<br />This is an easy read (200+ pages in nice 12pt. font).

I would have urged the reader to pick up a copy.<br />It's the first Sandra Brown book I've read, and I was impressed.  (It wasn't until later on that I realized she was a romance novel writer.)  I had wondered how she so adroitly manages the emotional aspect of the novel while still maintaining a rythmic plot.  <br />I was skeptical to pick up the book at first.  Reading the back cover you know it's about a gifted writer who writes the first portion of a manuscript and sends it to a (married) publisher he has singled out.  The publisher soon suspects that the story being told might be truer to life than the author would have her believe (and a relationship forms).  And that's just the beginning.<br />The plot has all the key elements I look for in a suspense novel: murder, revenge, sex and a twist at the end.  The author is able to give each of the characters depth in the book through Parker Evans' (male protagonist in the novel) manuscript.  (I felt this was a more clever device than just flat out narrating a history.)  The author makes it clear what each character is thinking and feeling.  It's not just a whodunnit book like the ones Mary Higgins Clark writes.  There's real character development in this book.  Chapter-by-chapter a past is laid out, motives are formed and the plot crystallizes.  <br />The reader of this novel should realize that this novel doesn't have much physical action in it.  Most of the action is of the emotional sort.<br />Lastly, it turns out by reading the forewards of the author's other novels, she has a predilection for happy endings (undoubtedly from her romance novel past).  I truly hope that she continues to write novels of this romance-suspense sort.<br />FLAP rating:<BR>F:3.5<BR>L:4<BR>A:3<BR>P:4.5<br />* For a more detailed explanation of how my FLAP rating system works.

The remainder of the book is a collection of appendices. It includes some maps, family trees, description of the language used, references to time and events of Middle Earth around the period The Lord of the Rings was written in. While I found most of them not very useful, there are some sections in the Appendices which are interesting. The most poignant part of the book I actually found in the appendix. It's the story between Aragorn and Erwyn. It talks about how they met and what their love for one another made them do. Don't miss that part.<br />This is by far the best &quot;unabridged&quot; version of the books I've read. It also comes in one book, not a boxed set like most other versions of this book.<br />I think the movie released by New Line Cinemas with the same title does the book justice. A little trivia about the movie: 1) The whole film was shot in a continuous 2 year period in New Zealand. 2) The Tolkien family does not support the cinematization of this book. 3) Vigo Mortenson does most of his own stunts in the film.

Although the title of my review sounds kind of negative, it doesn't fully reflect what I think about the book.  We know the Bourne story had to end eventually.  Ludlum makes the characters age in real time, i.e. while waiting for this story to be published, the characters have also aged.  David Webb is now about 50 years old, and he has two kids.<br />It was kind of frustrating that the elusive Jackal was so... elusive.  Bourne had several encounters with his ulimate enemy throughout the book, yet he ends up getting injured with each encounter as if to reinforce what the Jackal has been saying all along that he is the ultimate killer and Bourne is second.  It was also kind of contradictory for the Jackal to have so much energy towards the end of the book considering how he was described at the beginning as being weak and frail.  Aparently, the characters take on bullets like immunization shots; they come out stronger for some reason.<br />The plot(s) zigs and zags in this novel and eventually dovetails to coherency at the end.  It's just Ludlum's style to have several parallel paths throughout his stories that eventually fit together like puzzle pieces.  <br />As I read through the trilogy, the most irritating character I've come across is Mo Panov, the psychiatrist.  He's a quack to me.  Maybe it's because I don't see Ludlum with a psychiatry degree.  Maybe the way he talks and the advice he gives sound fake.  It's definitely something about this guy that irks the heck out of me.  In the first novel, he was briefly introduced towards the end.  In the second novel, he doesn't say much even though he accompanies Alex Conklin to Hong Kong.  This last novel seems to be his coming out party.  He takes on a personality and in my opinion falls face flat with it.<br />FLAP rating (see Bourne Supremacy review for the meaning of this rating system):<BR>F - 0<BR>L - 4.5<BR>A - 5<BR>P - 5<br />Enjoy this novel... for closure.	2001-12-25

(I'm currently halfway through the third installment of the Bourne series by Robert Ludlum -- The Bourne Supremacy.)  There are several reasons why I liked this story better than the first.  The first is that it is set in places in Southeast Asia like Hong Kong, Macao and China.  Since I grew up in the Philippines and have visited these places during summer and Christmas time for roughly 18 years, it feels familiar.  This sequel recaps what happens in the first novel in a very seemless, unobtrusive manner (a good thing).  He reminds the user about why Bourne does the things he does and feels the way he feels.  There's definitely more action and ass-whuppin' in this novel.  He kills without compunction (when he has to) and his methods are, as noticed by his clone, that of a technician's.  There's less of the mental anguish he felt in the first book as an amnesiac; therefore, less random ramblings in his mind.  There are actually two stories happening in parallel.  That of Bourne trying to reach his wife, and that of his wife trying to reach her husband.<br />The only gripe I do have about the dialogue and the asian characters in the story is their flowery use of words and seemingly religious devotion to Christianity.  I can tell you for a fact that although Christianity has its influences and followers in Asia, we do not bring in gods, spirits, and Christ into every sentence we utter.  It's a symptom of the author mistranslating common colloquial sayings or metaphors.  He also seems to think asians use &quot;Aiyaa!&quot; a lot.  Grandmothers or old wenches in a marketplace might use this word when spreading gossip or haggling over prices, but typically not men -- military or civilian.<br />I'm going to try something new in my reviews.  I'm going to introduce my own criteria for ranking a book (recurring factors I seem to comment on over and over again) on a scale from 0-5, and hopefully the average will correspond to a more accurate rating for the book.  I'll call it the FLAP system:<br />* Flagpole factor (F) - In keeping with the bromide that sex, crime and violence sells, this covers the first aspect.  Were there any erotic scenes?<BR>* Use of Language (L) - How's the dialogue?  Is it affected?  Does it reflect the vernacular of the setting?  Is it preachy?<BR>* Action (A) - How are the action scenes described?  Are they as lame as Clive Cussler's?  What are the weapons used?  How gory were the kills?<BR>* Plot (P) - How predictable is the story?  Is it a page turner?<br />F:1 (there was a rape scene)<BR>L:4 (use of local speech)<BR>A:5 (describes tools of the trade, lots of kills)<BR>P:4.5 (keeps you guessing)	2001-12-20

I promised I'd read The Bourne Identity after having seen the trailer starring Matt Damon in next year's movie by the same name.  When I realized that Robert Ludlum had written the original book in 1980, I went to the library to pick up a copy.  There's a similarity between the leading characters in Robert Ludlum's books.  They're usually male, headstrong (and ultimately always the good guy), determined and they fall for a girl that complements the guy in some way.  <br />A couple of persnickety points I have to mention in my reviews(as always):  I found it irritating the way Marie St. Jacques (the leading lady) speaks to Jason Bourne.  She uses &quot;Darling&quot; a lot and her speech seems somewhat formal and affected.  The author also uses italics to indicate what's going on in a character's mind from time to time.  The recurring themes in this book are: be a sponge (because you've got amnesia), move! (because you're being hunted), don't kill if you don't have to (because deep down you're actually a good guy - a govt. guy).  But sometimes, it just feels redundant and tedious to read.  The first Ludlum book I've read is the recent bestseller The Sigma Protocol.  I rated and reviewed that book on Amazon as well.  In my review I ended by saying the author got preachy towards the end to do some last minute plot explanation before ending the book.  I see a slight hint of that in this book as well.  <br />Some good points to consider are: It is my opinion that the author makes improvements to the style and tone of the sequel to this book called The Bourne Supremacy (which I liked better).  I found it more action packed and rythmic.  (The fact that I had spent most of my childhood summers in Hong Kong also helped.)  I also enjoy his usage of local dialect interspersed in the characters' speech to give color and that authentic feel to the characters in his books.  (Turns out he's been using this technique for the past 20+ years.  You still see it in his latest novel TheSigma Protocol.)<br />If I had to give a more precise rating for this book, I'd rate it a 4.5.  I'm saving the higher ration of 5.0 for The Bourne Supremacy, which I'll write a review for next.  Stay tuned.	2001-12-17

I guess the final action scene at the end of a female cop walking into a darkened room with the antagonist waiting to spring at her just brought back memories of the film.  It's been a few months since I read this book, but the plot elements still stand out (a good thing).  I liked the way this author adds detail to the forensics findings/pathology reports so that the lay reader (like me) can understand the significance of a procedure or medical test performed.  I don't know why I'm so forgiving about the hackneyed theme of a lone female detective who doesn't have a life but does her darndest to put up with harrassment and misclaimed credit for her work in order to show the world.  I guess it just works in this book.  There are several relationships and source of conflict in this book between Dr. Corday, Detective Moore; that of love and conflict of interest.  Between Moore and the tomboy cop (I forget her name); that of a crush and admiration.	2001-12-04
US	50752315	R34PVHZIUDRJYG	0679459626	466482043	Flesh and Blood	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Set you expectations right, and you might like it.	This is the first Jonathen Kellerman I've read.  I was really engrossed after reading the first few chapters, but my interest kind of waned somewhere mid-way through the book.  Perhaps my expectations were set up wrong.  The back page blurb did such a good job of exaggerating what I was going to find out about the underground world of sex and whoring that it was too good to pass up ;).  Instead what I did find was the dynamic duo of Alex and Milo going around town interrogating people (i.e. not much action).  I guess that's what a psychological thriller is all about, and the plot twist at the end was pretty clever.  Nonetheless, I was less impressed leaving the book as I was starting it.  Perhaps this book does merit a 3.5~4, but reviews are subjective and the more I write about it the more convinced I am that a 3 fits.<br />All I'm saying is that you might enjoy this book more if you don't go in expecting to find insider information on illicit activities of the underground world, or a deep love story between two people.  I'd be interested in seeing what other adventures Alex Delaware has gone through.	2001-12-04
US	50752315	R1VMOVDV0X6CQ6	0312276885	840537150	The Sigma Protocol	Books	4	1	2	N	N	great book, but preachy ending	This is the first book I've read by Robert Ludlum.  And from the likes of it, I'd be encouraged to read more (there's always The Bourne Identity which comes out in theaters next summer to start with).  The author's technique of covering multiple story threads occuring at the same time was well used.  You could picture the scenes to a mental movie quite vividly.  He doesn't give the protagonist in the story unbelievable traits.  In fact, he makes the male protagonist (Ben Hartmann) downright sensitive with her interactions with the female protagonist (Anna Navarro).  There were lots of twists and turns in this story, until the last few chapters.  What seemed really suspenseful at the beginning, quickly degenerated into preachiness in the last few pages as the author explains the logical reasoning behind the sinister plot to preserve the world's leading industrial/political icons.  The story is mainly set in Europe around Switzerland.  I like the fact that the author describes his surroundings and interactions with people in these countries in their native vocabulary (usually in italics), then explains them again in English for the benefit of the reader.  I'd like to think I learned a thing or two about those countries he mentioned.<br />All in all, it was a fascinating read.  Pick up a copy today!	2001-12-03
US	50752315	R1OI611DA72AEC	0385505833	999720718	Skipping Christmas: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	N	quick read, felt like a short story	I've never read any of Grisham's other novels.  However, it was due to Grisham's &quot;bankable&quot; name (as one reviewer pointed out) that I even noticed this book at all.  The story is very well written and the characters' ideosyncracies add a touch of realism.  The main character's frustrations about Christmas and the cost it involves ring a bell.  (I would love to &quot;skip&quot; a christmas.)  When I read this book, I somehow felt as if it were one of O Henry's short stories.  Maybe it's just me.  But if you want a quick escape for a few hours on some light reading, then this is a good book for you.<br />On another level, I'm not sure if this novel tries to teach a lesson (if at all).  I'm Catholic, and to me, it's trying to say that if I were to pause and reflect a while I'd have realized that a lot of what we do in the name of tradition has no connection to the birth of Christ 2000 years ago.  Or maybe this novel has a motivational purpose.  It tells you to treat your neighbors (people all around you) right because you never know when you'll need their help.	2001-11-19

Instead, I'll focus on some random thoughts I have about this book:<br />* Even though this book is 300+ pages long, only 217 pages of that is the actual &quot;research paper&quot;.  The other pages at the end contain appendices on footnotes, interview notes, research methodology and a list of companies and how each fared after the 4 elimination rounds leading up to the 11 good to great companies.  It also contains an epilogue with some Q&amp;A about the applicability and accuracy of the research results.<br />* The framework talked about in this book is a product of close scrutiny of empirical data, i.e. all the conclusions were derived by looking at the data.  In my opinion, the conclusions derived at by this book is only as good as the researchers that made them.  A lot of the concepts in this book are the result of heated arguments and debates (down to which chapter should be included and why).<br />* The book presents some interesting stories to stress its points, but some of them are flat out horrible analogies.  I'm impressed with Mr. Collins network of friends/acquaintances.  He tries to convince the reader that research based on companies can be applied to life in general as well.  He goes as far to provide the analogy of his wife giving up everything (work, career, time and money) to win the IronMan competition in Hawaii as an example of the Hedgehog Concept.  There's also a flimsy story of a football staff that he wants to use to show that going from good to great requires no more effort than remaining mediocre.<br />* I feel the author was pushing it in some areas of the last chapter where he talks about how Good to Great relates to Built to Last.  He comes up with this table with all the Built to Last concepts on the left column, and for each of those concepts he writes a sentence including all the concepts from Good to Great.  Itfelt so artificial.  It was evidently just a bunch of words strung together to convince the reader that both books mesh perfectly with one another.  Whereas I don't deny that indeed there might be a link between the two research studies, I don't believe he was convincing in explaining it.  Don't get me wrong.  I like the idea of Good to Great as a prequel to Built to Last.	2001-11-16

Despite my hesitation at picking up an autobiography, I must say Made in America turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise.  In it, Sam intersperses story telling with quotes from his colleagues, family and the media.  After reading the story, you get a very clear picture of Sam's humble beginnings as a local boy who delivered papers, a boyscout who saved a person's life, a variety store franchise owner who was driven out of town because his lease expired and he didn't know that it was part of the contract he signed.  In it you also learn what the Walmart Way was about.  It's about hard work, passion for the job and thoughtful spending.  <br />He completed it just before he died of cancer.  And a good thing he did because nobody can tell the story better than the person who's lived it.	2001-10-29
US	50752315	R3COX3VSQGALW8	0671034014	378094364	Mercy	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Story ain't bad, but the dialogue seemed a bit flaky to me.	I thought the story seemed interesting.  It's about 4 guys who made a pact to amass millions of dollars until they hit a limit and split it when they retire.  It's just that one of them is more clever and brutal than the others.  Now back to what I was saying about the dialogue being a bit flaky to me.  What I meant was that the main protagonist, a Justice Department attorney who has an FBI agent as a best friend and whose wife died earlier from booze and neglect, was said to not know how to flirt.  But from the first few coherent lines that come out of him, he seems like a huge jerk with a huge ego.  I have no idea how the female protagonist, a small town girl who has above average IQ and becomes a surgeon, could have fallen in love with anything but a pretty face.  I really wish there was more of this book I can comment on, but as you can tell with my seemingly inane critique about the dialogue -- maybe there really isn't much to it at all.	2001-10-29
US	50752315	RJN1FMS4Z00DV	0446527785	916864624	A Bend in the Road	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Slow paced story with a twist at the end.  That's it, folks.	I was warned that this book would be a love story.  I don't mind love stories.  I just never expected the plot to develop so slowly and for so little action to be mixed in.  It's about a small town deputy whose wife's death has been eating away at him for 2 years.  It's also about a divorced woman trying to escape the embarrassment of not being able to have children.  They meet by virtue of the deputy's son's learning problem (the school just didn't want to force him to study thinking it would add to the stress of losing a mother). I really can't say any more that wouldn't give the story away.  It's a book that, at times, can make you feel like a schoolboy with a crush.  But that's about all I felt.  :(	2001-10-29
US	50752315	R7A6NMPKLD81S	0399146008	157310859	Shock	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Uninspired at best	One of the very first novels I read was Coma by the same author.  And I loved it.  I even got my sister hooked on him.  However, I have to agree with many of the reviews on this list.  My biggest complaint about this book is how fake the dialogue is between the characters.  The action sequences (or lack thereof) slightly builds and never finishes.  The psychological aspects of what the characters had to go through don't have any realism.  Sad to say that although this book is very simply written and easy to understand and follow, it contains a rather predictable plot.  Moreover, cloning has such broad implications that to waste it by focusing on the Wingate clinic and its facilities and security system is shameful.<br />I really hope the next novel I read by this author doesn't fall into the same pitfalls this one does.	2001-09-27
