Warshawski Novel)	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Masterful Detective Story; Really Good Novel	I enjoyed this book from start to finish, couldn't put it down, didn't want it to end. Why can't I give it 10 stars? <br />V.I. Warshawski has become a mature woman with a realistic lovelife and real friends. It was a pleasure to spend time with her (although I'm worried she's going to starve to death; she never seems to eat anything). The complex insurance and &quot;recovered memory&quot; scam she is &quot;detecting&quot; was interesting and I never doubted any of it. Plenty of blood, gore, action and surprises. As usual I enjoyed the Chicago scenery, especially the occasional notes on the Cubs.<br />The story of Lotty, finally revealed after all this time, makes perfect sense. I always wondered what her &quot;problem&quot; was, as no doubt did Paretsky. I think Paretsky handled it well, revealing it as if Lotty is telling her the story, which in the end it turns out, she is. <br />Why do so many people think less of a book because it's a &quot;mystery?&quot; This is as good a novel as many pieces of &quot;literature&quot; I've read, and way better than some of those lyrical and tedious first novels reviewers go nuts over.	2001-10-18

The main character, Max, is a kind of &quot;fifth business,&quot; telling the story and having things happen to him without his really being involved. His friendship with Charlie deepens over the course of the book, effecting him in ways he never would have imagined. The writing and langauge are exceptional in a modern author. The characters in this short but intense book (145 pages) have a lot in common with those that appear in the Schmidt books where they are further fleshed out. I recommend all of Begley's books: I've read four this year.	2001-10-09

I read it while suffering through a cold and it kept me entertained. However, I think the characters are not clearly defined. Both Gail and her boyfriend change to suit the mood of the book. Sometimes she seemed like an incompetent wimp, other times she seemed tough and intelligent. I didn't like her all that much. I wasn't pleased by the way she kept breaking promises to her daughter. Is that what it's like to be a divorced mom? And the sappy wrap up from Anthony's point of view made me cringe.	2001-07-23

Most of the characters were none too likable, including Schmidtie. But I am soooo glad I finished the book. It was an excellent character study and very well written. My only gripe -- why did the publisher/editor leave out the quotation marks around all of the conversation? Is that just an affectation, or is it supposed to have some significance?	2001-07-10

Terminal boredom had set in. I wish Jacoby had written her book in chronological order instead of dividing the chapters by subject matter. Maybe then I would not have had to hear over and over about her nasty grandmother, brilliant uncle and unloving grandfather. I never felt like I knew these people or empathized with their emotions. Jacoby added some interesting insights into the history of Jewish-Americans, but not enough to support a book-length account of her ordinary 1950s childhood. Turbulent Souls by Stephen Dubner and A Good Enough Daughter by Aliz Kates Shulman are far better examples of this genre.	2001-06-04

I really enjoyed the main character's company throughout. Her wry asides are pointed and funny. The love interests add tension. I was glad not to hear directly from the main character's mother, whom I find incredibly annoying. I enjoyed reading about Cuba and Mexico and thought the amount of space given to describe the two countries was just right.<br />I don't know if the plot is believable. I simply accepted it. The author convinced me to go along.<br />After reading books that are packed with extra junk just to make them longer so that the publisher can sell them for higher prices (consider Diane Mott Davidson's &quot;Killer Pancake,&quot; full of repetition and recipes for disgusting low fat creations), I am pleased to see that Matera has not fallen for that ploy.

But overall I liked it. The last 1/4 is a bore. The same emotions repeated and the same family interactions with no one really growing or changing. Everyone resigned to the status quo.

The complex relations among his family members are excellently drawn and the neighborhoods in Paris and Brooklyn well described. I really enjoyed reading this book, but I thought the ending was abrupt and that it didn't grow naturally out of the book's beginning. It felt tacked on.

She is too hostile and lacks a real sense of humor. Also she is too knowledgable about newspapers and life in general for being only 29. What I liked least about this book was the writing style. I never really got to know Tess because the book is in 3rd person. The &quot;narrator&quot; knows a lot more than Tess does and for pages at a time we are not seeing the story unfold through Tess's eyes but rather through this narrative voice. The entire scene where Tess's &quot;rival&quot; Rosita is being fired is told this way and that's when I lost interest and stopped reading. I didn't care about the newspaper mystery, or about what happened to Uncle Spike. The book was overly long, filled with hours of driving around. The dog was poorly detailed. I love dogs and didn't care at all about this one. Most of the other characters were &quot;stock&quot; as well. For better mysteries involving older woman-young lover try early books by Judith Van Giesen.	2000-11-13

Because I could not answer these basic questions, I stopped reading on page 100. I simply could not relate to her or her life. She accidentally wrote a best selling book and she has the nerve to be whining!! But that's beside the point. I really wanted to enjoy this. I liked Schine's &quot;The Love Letter&quot; a lot. But this was sooooo pretentious. I stopped reading the inserts from the book-within-the-book after dragging my way through one or two boring, opaque selections. There were other parts of the book I didn't understand because they were about academics. Let those in the know enjoy. The rest of us would prefer to have the author help us out. Just for your information, I like complex books. Last year I read Anna Karinena (sorry about the spelling). It was wonderful, deep, complex but understandable.	2000-10-17

And so indirect, too. Woiwode never comes out and tells the reader what it's like to be a writer, but he's captured it perfectly. The book is full of all kinds of images, too, which makes it an intense reading experience. I feel like I really know him. When I finished it, I went back to the beginning to see how he started.

If only this author had included a preface or afterward explaining the  basis for her fiction. Did she read real letters? Were there really such  botanical missions? The main character's coy use of initials to hide her  gender is too cute as is her ability to rescue a man in a snowstorm. The  men in the book are without exception pains in the neck.

This book included long chapters in flashback form, the characters were not believable and their relationships were too frustrating for the reader. No  one told anyone anything. The mother moves out of New York City with her  daughter to find a better life in rural America. Instead of moving to a  small town, she rents a house in the country, dumps her kid with a  ridiculous babysitter so she's basically alone all day, then commutes to  town to work. I kept thinking about what would happen to her commute in the  winter in New York state on dirt roads. Ridiculous! This was supposed to be  an improvement over the warm protective downstairs neighbor in NY? Too dumb  to believe. I had to quit reading it. The plot was as slow as honey and not  anywhere near as sweet. For a really poignant young girl story read  Elizabeth Berg's Durable Goods and Joy School. Those are truly wonderful.	2000-06-19

Also, I've read several Anna Pigeon novels now and find her a very depressing character. She hates people and has absolutely no sense of  humor. Plus, there are no women in the book besides Pigeon. She's a loner  which makes her a difficult character to like. I don't know...it's just not  for me.	2000-05-17

If a book doesn't fit neatly into a category, how will the booksellers know where to shelve it? And  because selling is what today's publishing is all about, the fact that  readers who buy a book like this expecting a typcial genre mystery will be  disappointed doesn't matter to publishers. The readers have bought the book  and that's all that counts. As for the Edgar awards, I've never agreed with  them until now and this time I'm agreeing for a book I feel is far outside  their frame of reference. Maybe they just felt like being intellectuals.  Meanwhile, this was one of the best books I've ever read. I was very  impressed by the writing, the characters and the atmosphere. Yes, there  were some anachronisms. But I was willing to overlook them. I wanted to  read quickly to find out &quot;who done it,&quot; but I also read slowly to  savor the voices of the characters.	2000-03-21

I like the main character and would be willing to try earlier books in the series before the author started padding the book to make it 300 pages instead of 200.  Three hundred is simply too long. Many scenes repeated themselves without  further revealing character or advancing the plot. I feel it's the  publishers who want the books to be longer so that they can charge more for  them.

I've read any number of books about 1970s friendships begun in playgrounds that become profound bonds between  women for 30 years. In real life I'm not sure I believe this happens.

No one is hurt (much), and everything works out for everyone in the end. The characters' lives are as routine as yours or mine. They don't even eat  anything interesting. The &quot;mystery&quot; is barely mysterious and the  perpetrator of the &quot;crime&quot; is extremely tangential to the story.  Her motive is pretty dippy, too. the writing is okay, but extremely  ordinary. Anyhow, can't recommend this one except maybe to someone who  likes reading about musicians in any fiction format.	2000-02-07

How can a book evoke such opposite responses? I found &quot;A Gesture Life&quot; too distanced to be really enjoyable. I read the whole thing because it was considered by The New Yorker magazine to be on of 1999's  five best novels. I would have to disagree. I simply could not connect to  any of the characters.

I was interested in Mahoney's family, but  the bits and pieces she offered did not keep me reading. I was interested  in Hellman, but how many times did I need to read about how she brought a  cigarette to her lips? The pace was glacial, all the similies annoying and  distracting.

For 8 years after his divorce he blames all his problems with his young daughter on her! I find it hard to believe that he and his new wife,  her daughter and his daughter, never considered family therapy. I know this  is a novel, but rich, educated people very often do see therapists to help  them with their problems. As these people did not, the disfunctions in  their family increased until they were broken apart by a deus ex machina in  the form of a car crash. Kind of predicatable and lame. On the other hand,  the writing was excellent, the characters very real if unlikable, and the  descriptions excellent. Some of the minor characters such as Emma's  parents, were especially well drawn. As a Jewish reader, I find it  interesting to read about WASPs. What would this book be like if the same  plot and characters were written by a Jewish author with Jewish characters?  Would the father hug his daughter sooner?	1999-12-06

We never found out in  any specific way what happened when Jesus didn't make his reappearance, or  even why this book needed to be set in 999.) It never occurred to me until  I read other Amazon reviewers that the wives had no names. Duh! But this is  a fable after all and in 999 maybe wives' names were less important.

A lot of details bothered me about this book. First, I never believed that this couple was in love. Second, Ruth's story  was more like a case study than a piece of fiction. Ruth herself was flat  on the page. I never got to know her, understand her motivations, or like  her. The link between Joseph's need to care for her and the suicide of his  older sister was forced. I just felt that this novel was &quot;built&quot;  on a topic, rather than growing naturally out of deeply realized  characters. Way too much time was spent recounting studies about eating  disorders. If I were interested in that subject as a subject, I'd read the  studies myself. The events and characters never resonated with me, although  I was once a young woman in love and living with my boyfriend in New York  City, as were Joseph and Ruth. The writing was very good and I did  particularly enjoy Ruth's parents, step-mother, and Ruth's mother's lover,  Ernest Flek.	1999-09-14

The book is soooo long. Every sentence does not need three or four adverbs. And the plot just could not sustain my interest. I  also felt that some of the philosophy spouted by Prewitt was way beyond his  educational level and merely the author giving vent to his own ideas. I  quit on page 500 because I felt trapped.

My only  problem here, as with all four Graham Greene books I've read, is the  Catholic symbolism. I'm Jewish, so I feel really left out.

It includes most of the standard Trollope elements: two people who are in love with each other, but too shy to say so; a fortune-hunting woman and the men  she's after; members of the clergy; a bit of Parliament; family life in  England in the 1870s; fox hunting; and satire of life in both England and  the United States. The characters are extremely well drawn. Although the  writing is &quot;old fashioned,&quot; the emotions and situations are  up-to-date. There is humor, pathos and excellent description.	1999-07-15

That they regularly picked up older men and were never raped? Give me a break. All this poetic writing  gives me a pain in the neck. Also the &quot;ugly duckling with beautiful  friend&quot; scenerio is nothing new and done better elsewhere. Moore can  write, but why does she write like this?

The characters are totally static. They say the same things again and again. The mother is a total idiot. Then, on page  203 or so, when an entire new cast of characters is introduced, I couldn't  believe I was meant to get involved with them, too. Who cares? It's back to  Dickens for me. When he introduces a character, there's a reason and the  character is fascinating.	1999-06-15

I enjoyed it without thinking about whether it could really happen. If I want to read about reality, I'll go to nonfiction like &quot;A Civil  Action.&quot; This is pure fun. My only quibble was with the editing.

How many ways can you describe a girl's long, blonde hair? Not enough to make them interesting. Also, each chapter begins with a mundane  description of the weather. Who cares? If you want to read two really  engaging books about a teenage girl, check out Elizabeth Berg's Durable  Goods and Joy School.

The characters were well defined, their mid-life crises interesting. I enjoyed it and laughed at the clever outcome. I agree with  other Amazon reviewers that the end is a bit contrived, but I prefer to  think of it as &quot;neat.&quot; Ian McEwan's books all concern moral  issues. They are excellent, too.

People who like a writer always say, &quot;Oh, but you read the wrong book.  You should try...&quot; I don't believe writers vary that much. This book  had an uninteresting plot, flat characters, and no suspense whatsoever. The  conversations were flat on the page, the men had no personalities  except  Marino whose character was delineated by his poor grammar. Scarpetta is  barely interesting, but even so, I never believed for a moment that she  would love someone as impersonal as Mark. I kept reading because I am a  sucker.	1999-04-16

It just didn't work for me. I never believed the main character, Jo, was attracted to Eli. I thought her  husband Daniel was way too saintly to be true. Her daughters were soooo  bitchy. I have sons, myself. Are all daughters so mean to their mothers? I  found the book boring with an excessive number of weather descriptions and  other details that filled space, but contributed little. Also, way too much  philosophical pondering without any enlightening conclusions. I would give  it fewer than three stars, but the flashback to Cambridge life was very  well done. However, it's not worth reading just for that description of  &quot;hippy/commune&quot; life.	1999-03-31

How often do I want to go with Erlich through her struggles about a kosher kitchen? How often do I want to hear how terrific her  mother-in-law is? That woman's perfectionism would have gotten on my nerves  if I were her daughter-in-law. I know she suffered horribly through WWII,  but I don't think that's a reason to assume she's now some kind of saint.  Anyhow, I liked the childhood memories a lot - many were like my own. And  the writing, if a bit flowery, is very good. I finished the book and was  glad it finally ended.	1999-03-01

Mr. Kuusisto's ability to survive was impressive. However, there were many places in the book when I didn't know  what he was talking about: references to obscure poetry and mythology,  words I needed to look up, and writing that was way too poetic for my  taste. I like straightforward memoir writing a lot better. Even a poet can  do that. See &quot;Fugitive Spring,&quot; by Deborah Digges. But I did  enjoy reading this book, and especially liked the end when Kuusisto gets  his guide dog.	1999-01-11

Then things started happening over again. How many scenes in &quot;The Horse&quot; bar does a reader need? After a few, they no longer reveal character or advance  the plot. I found Sully an interesting character and especially liked his  landlady. But some of the other characters were charicatures, the lawyer,  for instance, and Carl. Anyhow, the book got me through two international  plane rides so it wasn't all bad. The writing is good, if sometimes  careless. There were a few places were new information was suddenly given  about a character and never explained. Also, I'm not all that happy when an  author goes into the point of view of minor characters like Clive Jr. for  just one time so near the end of a book.	1998-12-25

I kept reading, borne along by the details, while at the same time I was bored by the plot, of which there was very little. I was interested in  the main character's feelings, but thought her husband was a jerk. I read  quickly to the end just to get it over with. I can't believe this book was  published when so few books of the &quot;mid list,&quot; non-violent,  non-sexy, type are. Oh well. The author probably had a two book contract.	1998-12-07

The descriptions are compact, yet they bring the scenes to life so that I can see them in my mind. I love this kind of visual writing.  Other authors offer long drawn out description that tells us nothing (see  Cold Mountain) while Bainbridge hardly seems to be describing anything and  yet shows so much. This book is completely absorbing. If it were longer it  might not be as good, but because I like the writing so much, I was sorry  to see it end.	1998-12-04

The descriptions of Congo village life are excellent, and, I assume, accurate. But the relationships among the characters are never  fully developed and the father remains a mystery. All the characters  are  just described and remain the same throughout. The last 100 pages or so are  boring, especially Leah's political viewpoint. Yet the book made me laugh  and cry and kept my interest. I don't think it's a great book, but it is  one of the best of the less-than-great, popular books.	1998-12-01

I know it's always a matter of taste, but it really surprises me to read other readers' negative reviews. Barrett did an excellent job of revealing the characters, drew me  into their conflicts, showed me the Arctic, told me about Victorian  naturalists, and kept my interest from beginning to end.

But for some  reason, I loved this book. I am basically a novel reader, but I do like  travel adventure and that's how I approached this book. I loved the part  about the ship in 1857 and really could picture what Mr. Kinder described,  although some illustrations and diagrams would have helped. I loved the  description of Tommy as a boy. I read all the technical stuff, didn't  understand it that well, but could follow it and that's due to a definite  talent Mr. Kinder has for description. The only thing missing for me was  some info about Tommy's adult life. He must have one, despite his monomania  about the deep sea. Does he have a wife, a girlfriend? Does he have dinner  with Mom and Dad on Sunday? Something to make him a bit more human.	1998-10-30

This had absolutely none of the emotional charge those books  have. Nor did the people in it seem to have been affected by the war. I  never felt anything for any of the characters, including the main character  Ian Rutledge. The pace of the book was glacial. The women characters were  interchangeable and straight out of a romance novel. I finished the book  just to see &quot;who dunnit,&quot; and that was certainly a  disappointment.

Most novels  are too long, too rambling and full of improbable occurances. Beard's book  is just like life, beautiful, horrible and without reason.

This author in just 250 pages manages to tell a story of real passion. I especially liked the detailed descriptions of the interactions between the husband and wife, Joe and Clarissa. That so much remains unresolved between them is completely realistic. Marriages between people who love each other go on despite these issues, as I think theirs will. I also liked the minor characters in this novel, for instance, the old hippies Joe visits in the country. Each is specifically described. Plus all of his writing makes it extremely easy to visualize the events in the novel. The novel had plenty of tension and in the end, I was left with Joe and Clarissa's differing views of the situation, never really knowing which was &quot;right&quot; and I liked that ambiguity. In fact, oddly enough, ambiguity is what made most of this novel so satisfying. I also thought the details about the dead man's life were excellently put together. Overall, a great read.	1998-03-02

After that it crawled forward at a snail's pace, one predictable event after another, rich people leading the good life, the main character a man for whom most everything works out brilliantly. Eventually the author became stuck for an event and so killed off the wife. Surprising in a book by a woman author that the male characters are much more interesting and well rounded than the female. They are all sweet and adoring of the main character. Best character: the dog, Ralph. If this book had been published in 1960, the year the story ends, perhaps it would have been okay. Now old fashioned and disappointing. The writing is good, but long-winded.	1998-02-25

The novel revolves around the lives of people in a small California town and includes inmates of a &quot;drunk farm.&quot; The plot was entertaining, if a bit contrived.

I am an impatient reader and critical, but I enjoyed reading about Benjy, even if he was whiny and ungrateful. The scenes in India and London are well done, and his wife is an interesting character. The author's italicized chapter beginnings are too mystical for me. I quit reading them after two or three.

In China Trade, Lydia Chin was interesting and witty, and her Chinatown background made her different. Bill Smith is as ordinary as his name. All his little quirks, like classical piano and his love of Lydia, are just that, quirks. They don't add up to a believable character. I got tired of his descriptions of fall leaves and his lonely, depressed personality. The plot was good and side characters like Mrs. Goldstein very well done. The African American dialogue some characters speak gets tedious. Lydia was a complete blank in this volume. She might have been a totally different person from the Lydia in China Trade. Her romantic feelings about Bill are vague. I would not recommend this book even though it did win the Shamus award.	1998-01-13

I have read many mysteries and this &quot;domestic&quot; variety is my favorite kind. The characters are realistic (for a mystery novel) and the setting is exotic. I liked the main character and look forward to reading another book about her. Problems were (1)less-than-realistic romantic interest with cliched &quot;is he naughty or nice&quot; theme. (2) Some of the people who helped the main character were rather unbelievably willing. (3) There was a clue that the main character had mixed up when it was obvious to the reader and should have been to her. Oh, well. It kept me entertained during the time I had for reading over Christmas. That's what counts.	1997-12-29

The characters in this book are borrowed from a dozen other southern coming of age stories, as is the plot. Three of the main male characters have last names beginning with the letter &quot;H&quot; which makes it hard to remember which is which. Each character is a stereotype, from the angry black cook to the mother who needs a rest cure to the vapid young girl. Also, the writing is poor. For example, what does this sentence mean? &quot;A hot, blue haze rolled in the window light with the greasy exhaust fan above the back door running wide open.&quot; Is that supposed to be poetic? The author uses &quot;laid&quot; when he should have used lay, as in, &quot;I laid on his bed while he hobbled around...&quot; Please. If you want to be an author learn grammer first and also, skip the poetic if it doesn't tell the reader anything. I rate this book a five because it is just the kind of average book that people think makes a good summer read. Take it to the beach and toss it in the trash	1997-07-16
