US	52679790	R37DO8BEPLIL0Q	1858285569	308646251	The Rough Guide to Southwest USA, 2nd Edition (Rough Guide Travel Guides)	Books	5	40	41	N	N	Best single guide for the American Southwest	I usually carry multiple guidebooks on my vacations, but during my recent trip to the American Southwest I relied exclusively on this book.  <br />One of the reasons I recommend this book is that it covers the Southwest as a single region, so it includes New Mexico, Arizona, southern Colorodo, southern Utah, and Las Vegas.  Most other books are State-based, so it would take multiple books to cover the entire region.<br />Another reason to pick this book is that it is opinionated.  It lists top ten sites in various categories (national parks, museums, etc.), so that you can plan your time effectively.   The auther even recommends against some things, unlike most guidebooks. <br />I am picky about maps, and the maps in this book were uniformly accurate and reliable.  Driving tips and recommended routes were quite useful.<br />You will also find this book compact and light.  While some other books are loaded with pictures, I find these books best enjoyed at home, before and after my trip, because they are too heavy to lug around during my trip.<br />Finally, I stayed in 5 hotels, all recommended by this book, and they were all safe choices.  If you are looking for a splurge, I recommend Goulding's lodge at Monument Valley, especially for fans of old movies.  To my surprise, I enjoyed the museum on site.  Also, I used the inroom VCR to watch Stagecoach, and this was the perfect setup for my Monument Valley visit the next morning.  At Canyon do Chelly NM, I would recommend not staying at the overpriced, dreary lodge.  It's cheaper to stay at one of the places just outside the park. In Santa Fe, the El Rey Inn is convenient, friendly, and has a Route 66 feel.	2001-12-22

While I was already familiar with the concepts of XP Planning from reading various articles, it was good to get the authors' complete message from start to finish.<br />While the XP process sounds great, and I would love to try it, I do not think it is realistic for most projects.  For one, it requires the dream client, who is knowledgeable of the problem domain, patient, decisive, documentation-averse, and trusting.  A second precondition is a project of small to moderate size and complexity.  (The authors speculate on how the process may be extended to teams greater than 10 in size.)  The third precondition is that the team should be staffed with the most motivated, creative, team-oriented, and skilled developers.  (At least that is what I deduce from what the developers must do.)<br />With all these preconditions satisfied, then of course a stripped down process will work!!  Unfortunately, most of us live in a different world.<br />That said, I did find the book worth a couple of hours, as it reinforces some concepts, provides a few new ideas, and gives you a complete overview of this latest fad.	2001-08-05

(I stopped in Brussels briefly and used the internet to plan my few hours there.)  <br />The small size of this guide gave me concern that it was too superficial.  To the contrary, it provides a surprising amount of information by focusing on only the sites that could be covered during 2 days in each city.  In 2 days, I covered all the recommended Bruges sites.  In one day I covered about half of the Antwerp sites.  I supplemented the information with books and audioguides available at the museums, as I would have done anyway, even with a thicker guide book.<br />In terms of contents, the guide provides a brief but useful overview of the region and for each of the three cities a city map (the usual great Michelin quality), listing of must-see sights (usual Michelin star system), and descriptions of those sites, even with several good pictures.  It also provides an abbreviated list of hotels and restaurants, but these are not budget recommendations. (You'll probably need another source to find a hotel - I found mine on the internet.)<br />Best of all, this book is compact and light, and really does fit in any pocket you have.	2001-05-14

Since the quality of these guides is so consistent I do not typically feel that reviews are necessary.  You always know what you're getting when you buy a Green Guide.<br />I am writing this review because the Germany Green Guide is particularly exceptional.  Since there are no supplemental regional guides for Germany, the country guide is packed with information for all regions.  This contrasts with the France and Italy country guides, which are superficial and significantly less useful than the regional guides for those countries.<br />Particular strengths of this book include the itineraries for driving scenic roads, such as the Moseltal, Schwarzwald Crest Road (particularly the southern parts), and the German Alpine Road.  The maps highlight (and rate with stars) amazing sites along the way, including waterfalls, spectacular views and panoramas, villages, churches, museums, castles, hiking trails, etc.  Required touring times are usually provided.  Depending on schedule and interests you can easily plan your time.<br />If your visit to Germany will be limited to Berlin, Munich, and a bus tour to Neuschwanstein, then this book is overkill.  But, if you want to explore more of Germany on your own then this guide is essential.	2000-10-14

Likewise, if you plan to stick to the Autobahn, this map is overkill.  <br />Michelin maps come in different levels of detail, and this  happens to be the most detailed one for this region.  Michelin maps are  universally accurate and I find them easy to read.  I particularly like to  follow the routes marked in Green because they are always worth the detour.  <br />For safety reasons, I recommend that you use this, or any map to plan  your route prior to driving, unless you have a passenger available to  navigate.	2000-05-21

All inns in the Red Guide have professional service and great  food.  Inns listed in both guides will also be unique and charming.  Coupled with the data provided by the Red Guide, the pictures in this guide  are very useful.<br />Best of all are the places in the countryside.  Easy  parking, phenomenal food, great wine, and usually a great setting.  This  is not a budget guide, but there are some great deals to be found.  The  cheapest place I stayed was an isolated Auberge in the Vosges mountains  that charged only $50 per person for half board.  This included a very  small room, great 3 course dinner, buffet breakfast, and all tax and  service.	2000-04-25

I found the Blue Guides for both regions outstanding.   Not surprisingly, both are quite worn (the best sign of a useful  guidebook).  <br />What makes this guidebook stand out is the incredible  breadth of coverage of all tourist sites in Tuscany, making it quite thick,  but not particularly heavy.  (The only guide that I have seen that even  comes close in terms of coverage is the Michelin Green Guide for Tuscany.)   Each chapter represents a tour which covers either a town and its vicinity  or a driving circuit.  Within each tour, every conceivable tourist  destination is identified, including small towns, churches, squares, public  buildings, museums, archeological sites, etc.  For significant museums and  churches, the guide directs you through the works in a logical order.  For  the most part, individual works/objects are listed but not discussed, but  notable works are identified with asterisks.  Particularly remarkable  works, such as Cathedrals and great fresco cycles, are discussed in more  detail.  <br />If you are interested in Italian art, architecture, and ancient  history, then this book tells you where to find it in Tuscany, and provides  brief descriptions.  The guidebook does not teach you the history of art  and architecture in Tuscany, nor should it.  For this, you will need to do  some additional reading. <br />Fine maps and a brief history are provided for  each significant town.  Parking advise is provided for most towns, and I  strongly suggest you follow this advise.  (I learned this the hard way.)   Also pay close attention to the opening hours, which are quite accurate.   The guide's hotel and restaurant recommendations seem quite good; they  overlap significantly with the Michelin Red Guide and Frommers.   Unfortunately, no descriptions or prices are provided, so most people will  want another guidebook for this use.  Some of the site closure information  was out of date, but I expect this to be updated with the 2000 edition.	2000-04-18

I did not expect much from this book, but it managed to disappoint anyway.  The  writing style is so conversational and unstructured that it quickly becomes  annoying.  <br />I could put up with the writing style if it was not so  obvious that the author was filling space to make up for the lack of  content.  Basically, if you plan to shop for designer clothes and purses in  the big cities and want to know where the designer stores are, then you  might get some use out of this.  Beyond that, the content is severely  limited.  Probably the worst example I can think of involves an outlet  store.  The author admits that she could not even find the place, yet she  still included it in her book!	2000-04-17

Since Vasari was a contemporary of the High-Renaissance artists, I thought it  would be interesting to read his descriptions of artists and their  technical development.  The book is organized into a series of essays  focusing on artists from Cimabue to Titian.  In this translation, the  editors have included only those artists still believed to have made a  significant contribution.  <br />To my surprise, this book was not only  informative, but it was also quite entertaining.  Vasari focuses mostly on  the artistic development of each artist, but frequently strays into  fascinating stories about their personal lives.  The writing style is  surprisingly readable, thanks to both Vasari and the editors.  The notes in  the back of the book are extremely useful.  They point out where Vasari has  been proven inaccurate, elaborate on some of Vasari's points, and provide  updated locations for some of the works.<br />This book was invaluable during  my recent trip to Tuscany and Umbria.  It was thrilling to read Vasari's  descriptions of great fresco cycles, paintings, and sculptures while I was  viewing them in person, whether in the Uffizi in Florence or the Duomo in  Orvieto.  I cannot recommend this book enough to all art lovers,  particularly those who are planning a visit to central Italy.	2000-04-08

If you are planning a trip to Italy, buy this guide first.  It is concise and will focus your attention on the most worthy destinations in Italy.   Once you have decided on which regions to visit you can buy supplementary  regional/city guides geared towards your specific interests.<br />As expected  with this series, the guide provides great coverage for compact regions  served by great public transport.  For example, the chapter covering the  Naples/Pompeii/Sorrento/Amalfi/Paestum region is particularly excellent.   The maps and directions for using the local commuter transportation were  flawless.  I used buses, trains, and boats to move around the region with  ease, avoiding the readily available and costly tour buses.  Rick also  correctly instructs you to stay in Sorrento, which is pleasant and safe,  rather than Naples, which is neither.  <br />I also visited Florence and the  Hill Towns of Tuscany and Umbria.  Once again, Rick's recommendations were  on the mark, correctly focusing you on the most enjoyable destinations such  as Siena and Assisi.  If you want to cover the region in depth, as I did,  you will need an additional guide (I recommend Blue or Green).  <br />Other  chapters that looked particulary good were those for Rome, Venice (great  maps and instructions for using commuter boats), Cinque Terre, and the  Dolomites.  I can't wait for my next trip to Italy!<br />I found the hotel and  restaurant recommendations somewhat low-end for my needs, but did have  success with 2 hotels and a few of the restaurants.	2000-04-08

The numerous pictures in this book helped me to visualize potential destinations and decide which regions were most appealing to me.  I did not find the hotel  recommendations useful, since they tended to be relatively expensive.<br />I  do not see much value in this book once you arrive at your destination.   The real thing in front of you is so much more awesome than the diagrams.   For the most part, other than the diagrams, the information provided is  superficial.  For example, the Duomo/Baptistry in Florence are alloted 4  pages, most of which are covered with pictures.  Many other guides provide  more information than this in a paragraph or two, while some devote several  pages to describing the incredible history and works of art.  <br />I ended up  leaving this guide home because of it's excessive weight, and now that I've  returned and looked through it again I do not regret my decision.  I would  admit that I am in the minority in judging this book, as it seemed to be  the most ubiquitous Italy guidebook, available at all the major sites in  multiple languages.	2000-04-02

If you are looking for an all-in-one guide this is not it, particularly due to the  insufficient historical, artistic, and other site-related information, as  well as the inferior maps.   Also, if you are using a travel agent, then  this guide does not add much value for you.<br />Where this guide is most  valuable is in the planning process.  If you are trying to figure out your  itinerary, then this guide provides an overview of all the major  destinations, without overwhelming you with a mass of unnecessary,  encyclopedic data.  Another useful feature is the lists in the front of the  book which recommend `bests' in categories such as museums, cathedrals,  small hotels, ancient ruins, etc.  These lists help focus your research on  particular regions of interest, and also in developing a varied itinerary.   <br />I also found the hotel selection quite good, especially for midrange  accommodations.  (Most guides seem to focus on either cheap or expensive.)   This book paid for itself easily by guiding me to less expensive hotels  that were within my standards.  Four of the hotels I stayed in were in this  book, and they were all exactly as described, and good values.  The  restaurant recommendations were uniformly decent, although it's fairly easy  to find decent, moderate restaurants in Italy.  I recommend asking for  advise at your hotel.<br />Admittedly, once I got to Italy, I did not often  find this guide useful, but occasionally it provided an unexpected and  useful tip.  For example, it may recommend a particular store or product,  or a particularly convenient bus/ferry and how to use it, or a good takeout  gourmet shop.  In my case, these tips saved me valuable time and money.   (Actually, I would recommend cutting this book up and only taking the  relevant sections with you on your trip, since most of the content is  geared towards the planning process.)	2000-03-31

Although it is not designed as a detailed site guide (you will need Green  or Blue Guides for that), it is definitely useful for planning where you  will go and how you will get around.  Also, given it's small size and light  weight, you can always find room for this guide in your suitcase or  backpack.  With regard to hotels and restaurants, some are a bit low end  for me, but I did stay at 2 of the pricier hotels and ate in a couple of  the restaurants and found them quite good.<br />I spent 3 days in the  Sorrento/Naples/Pompeii area and the chapter for this region was perhaps  the best I've encountered in this series.  Rick correctly guides you to  stay in Sorrento, and provides exceptional advice on what to see and how to  use the excellent transportation system in the region, including great  maps, trip durations and fares.  Other than buying site guides at major  sites such as Pompeii, this is the only guide you need for this region.<br />I  also spent a considerable amount of time in the hill towns of Tuscany and  Umbria.  I visited most of the Hill Towns that Rick recommends, as well as  a few others.  While I enjoyed all of these visits, I would say that Rick  does a good job of highlighting the most worthwhile towns (especially Siena  and Assisi).<br />If you are going to Rome, Florence, or Venice, then this  book will definitely help you to prioritize your time, decide where to stay  (area if not hotel), and figure out how to get around.  I did not go to  Venice, but noticed that there was a great map and text describing how to  get around the canals.  The chapters on the Cinque Terre and the Dolomites  also looked very useful.  My one disappointment with this book is that  Sicily is not included, perhaps because it is not practical to include it  in a whirlwind tour.	2000-03-29

Instead, cities and towns are listed alphabetically, with hotel and restaurant listings rated on a scale of 1 to 4.  For each listing, symbols  and numbers are used to indicate features such as credit cards accepted,  number of rooms, min/max price for a double room, etc.  Places that are  deemed particularly desirable are marked in red or with a special symbol  indicating a peaceful setting; in my experience, these establishments are  uniformly outstanding and worth seeking out.  Detailed and accurate city  plans are provided for cities of sufficient size.<br />If you are sticking to  major cities or just one region, then this guide is not really necessary.   If, however, you plan to explore less touristed areas and/or multiple  regions, then this guide will provide abundant and reliable hotel and  restaurant listings.  On a recent trip to Italy, I stayed in 6 hotels  listed in this book and was pleased with all of them.  I also ate in 7  listed restaurants, each providing a memorable experience.  Although this  is not a budget guide, there are many moderately priced selections; I spent  between $50 and $75 for single rooms and as little as $15 for a 3-course  dinner with wine (although $20-25 was the typical price for restaurants  with ratings of 1 or 2).  <br />The unexpected bonus with Michelin Red Guides  is the great city maps, which are particularly useful for drivers.  For  example, I used the town maps for San Gimingnano and Volterra to locate  public parking lots prior to my arrival, so that I could save time and park  in the most convenient location.  For driving in larger towns (which is  rather stressful given their medieval layouts) it helped that one-way  streets are marked with small red arrows, again allowing me to plan my  route in advance.	2000-03-28

Although I got to intermediate French in college, I did not learn how to  reserve a hotel room.  I first used this phrase book to make hotel  reservations (even with non-English speakers).  This book also helped me  get gas (don't forget, sans plomb) and find English language movies with  French subtitles (V.O. = version originale).

It looks like the 2000 version is hardcover, which  may help eliminate this problem.  I wish Michelin would come up with a  binding method that would allow me to remove and replace pages.  Then it  would be perfect.  As for examples of how one uses this atlas ..  Last  September I was in France and for the first time I had torn up my tour  books and brought only the relevant sections.  After arriving in Chamonix,  I realized this was not worth a 2 night stay (thanks, Rick Steves!),  so I  decided on a last minute detour to Burgundy.  Forunately, I had this atlas  and my Michelin Red Guide (with it's indespensible town and city maps and  suggested sites).  Sitting in my car, I planned my route for the next 2  days, which included stopovers in Tournus (a little difficult to find a   room) and Beaune (no problem finding a room).  Since I had no textual  guidebooks for Burgundy with me, I bought a Green Guide in Tournus.  With  this guide and my trusty atlas, I easily planned a drive through the  Burgundy countryside and visits to a chateau, abbey, wineries, and  panoramic viewpoints.  I drove into and out of Beaune and Dijon without any  problem.  Besides using the atlas for navigation, I also have used it to  find spectacular and often unexpected viewpoints and scenery in locations  as varied as the Corniche roads between Nice and Monaco, the Gorges of  Verdun/Lac de Ste Croix, perched villages in the Luberon, very green  farmland in the Indus River Valley, ruined/untouristed castles overlooking  Colmar, a moving WWI battlesite and cemetary (Le Linge) in the Vosges.   This atlas is for travellers who want their trips between destinations to  be as unforgettable as the destinations themselves.	2000-01-08

The excruciating detail can become repetitive, we do not all have access to the exact ingredients, nor the patience to deal with the  precise temperature requirements. That said, this book allowed me, an  amateur, to make some amazing bread. I follow the instructions fairly  closely, but use common sense where appropriate. I have not yet used a  thermometer, and yet have produced some great regular and sourdough loaves,  bagels, pitas, etc. What this book does is tell you the steps you need to  follow, techniques to use (particularly kneading), how the dough should  look and feel at different stages. This book provides everything you need  to learn the basics of bread-making (except patience, of course).	2000-01-08

Authentic Thai ingredients are becoming more and more available, both in Asian markets and even in regular grocery stores.  This book provides authentic recipes that  are easy to follow.  The book also has some beautiful pictures of both the  dishes described and the regions of Thailand from which they originate.   The author provides valuable background information for both eating and  (unexpectedly) travelling in Thailand.  In fact, I brought this book on a  trip to Thailand.  Since many Thai menus have dishes in both Thai and roman  letters, I was able to match some of the menu items with recipes in the  book, which was both helpful and interesting.

Later, he learned how to turn the pages.  Now, he uses it  less, but is starting to learn the names of some of the pictures.  As with  the other reviewers, I have also given this as a gift to newborns.  The  White on Black book was not a winner with my nephew.	2000-01-08

Of course, he loves anything related to peek-a-boo.  I like that the teletubbies are so original (and less boring for me, particularly after a dozen consecutive  viewings) compared to more generic children's characters such as Pooh and  Disney.	2000-01-08

If you want spectacular beauty, picturesque Swiss mountain villages, lots of cowbells,  and efficient transportation, then the Berner Oberland is your heaven.   Rick's book provides great maps, train schedules, and hiking  recommendations (I particularly loved the valley walk with the cows).  But,  I agree with the reviewer below from Atlanta on comments about where to  stay.  Unless you want isolation, do not stay in tiny Gimmelwald.  In  addition to Grindelwald, I recommend Wengen, which was the most convenient  town for me.  My balcony view from the Wengener Hof hotel was breathtaking  and reasonably priced (and easily reserved over the internet).  Grindelwald  is certainly a good alternative, and is the best for shopping.  With regard  to Lake Geneva, Rick is not a big fan, but I definitely recommend a visit.   Lausanne is the most beautiful city, I took a great cruise of the Lake,  Yvoire is a well preserved (and yes, touristy) small French town with great  views of the Lake, and Chateau Chillon was very worthwhile.  I didn't have  time for Geneva, but hope to return some day.  The tourist train from  Interlaken to Montreaux was unforgettable, but avoid Montreaux except for  the chateau.  I highly recommend a Swiss rail pass - I bought one from  Rick's site and it was a great convenience in both of my destinations.	2000-01-08

Rick Steves does a pretty good job of identifying the must sees in France, but, I think his itinerary  is crazy.  Those who follow it must spend most of their time on trains and  in cars. (If you plan to follow his itinerary you should take his bus tour  - less stress.) While I found this book useful to my planning process, I  could not imagine a trip in France with only this book.  It omits too much.   If you have already spent much time in France then I don't think this book  would be of much help to you.	1999-12-12

I found this book extremely useful in planning my trip to Japan, especially when selecting destinations outside of the obvious Tokyo and Kyoto.  In particular this book convinced me to stay over in Miyajima after  going to Hiroshima, and to spend a night at a Buddhist temple in Koyasan.   These were unforgettable experiences.  While this guide does not provide  adequate navigational information (I used Lonely Planet and Japan Solo) it  is more valuable for itinerary planning.  I also found the hotel and  restaurant recommendations reliable and interesting.	1999-10-09

I would not travel to Japan without this indespensible source of information.  If I had to pick one book to travel with I would probably pick this one for its navigational information, cursory cultural  information, etc.  That said, I have rarely had success with LP's hotel and  restaurant recommendations.  I ate in a particularly horrid restaurant in  Takayama (although I would not necessarily recommend that town for its  great cuisine.)  If you will be travelling independantly in Japan, you need  this guide.  But if at all possible carry at least one other guide as a  supplement.	1999-10-09

This book differs from other English language guide books to Japan both in content and delivery.  The book was useless for planning hotel and restaurant visits, but for maps and step-by-step instructions for visiting  a site it was extremely valuable.  Also, the writers often showed a sense  of humor and honesty in playing down some popular sites, while not  hesitating to recommend other less known sites.  The book is small and  light and definitely worth keeping with you on any trip to Japan.	1999-10-09

If you are travelling around France, especially by car then I highly recommend this book.  While I do not think the book contains even one full sentence it was perhaps the most used and worn out book upon my return from  my first trip to France, with my Michelin Road Atlas a close second.  If  you are a travel information addict like me you will revel in the details  of this guide, including perfectly accurate city plans, comprehensive site  recommendations, reliable hotel recommendations with all the info you  really need, including prices, ratings, facilities, and noteworthy  characteristics.  And best of all, great recommendations for those who care  about food.  While the recommendations are not perfect (some of the hotels  are generic) at least you know if you are arriving in a town without a  reservation you have a reliable list of &quot;safe&quot; places to stay.   Best case scenario, you may find an unexpected gem, especially if you hunt  out one of the places marked as peaceful or picturesque.	1999-10-09
