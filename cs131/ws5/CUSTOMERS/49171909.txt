The authors here do a great job of presenting their findings and then explaining how and why they made the assumptions they did based on those findings.  Anybody can follow their logic and come to their own conclusions based on the evidence.  It is also very well written and even the story of the researchers travelling to Africa is quite interesting.<br /><br />I saw another reviewer bashing the authors for making wild conclusions based on minimal evidence.  But that is the creative genius of these people.  They're not making wild conclusions, but rather the most logical findings they can working with tiny pieces of bone millions of years old.  For instance, at one point the authors discuss finding evidence of a specific type of disease in a pre homo-sapiens fossil.  We know that the person (or hominid!) would have been partially crippled for some extended period of time, and certainly unable to gather food and defend against predators.  Much like reading tree rings, the next layers of bone show that the infection or disease healed, and the being likely recovered and went on with life.  The fact of the recovery leads to the author's conclusion that at this point in pre-history, the (person) had someone else as a caregiver, helping gather water and food and offering shelter, etc.  This is important and offers glimpses into the mental and emotional development at that point in time.  It seems a rather simple idea, but it's just one of numbers of brilliant ideas the authors proffer that don't seem like wild conclusions at all.<br /><br />The entire book is fascinating and quite honestly makes me wish I could go back in time and change professions.	2005-01-21

That's fine though.  He's been cranking out books for nearly half a century, and in the twilight of his career shouldn't he write a different book?  I probably wouldn't recommend this book to be someone's first exposure to Kurt Vonnegut, but if you love his work then there is little doubt you will love this book. <br /> <br />He gives the readers even more random musings than usual, and also gives a lot more of his personal history than ever before.  He discusses being a \\"humanist\\" in really one of the most simplest yet profound brief exchanges he has ever created.  Some parts of the book almost feel like he just wants to throw in random thoughts or paragraphs that didn't have a proper home in past books.  This really works, though.  The odd structure of jumping back and forth time creates the perfect home in this book for all these thoughts.   <br /> <br />If this is his last book, it's an interesting way to end it all and not a disappointment at all.	2005-01-21

It's an appealing concept, but in the end the best thing about the book is the short summaries of all the listed novels. egardless, the division of old and new classics into useful cateogories and then short summaries to help the reader pick and choose the most suitable books for him / her is very helpful.    Here are the problems, however, with the 1/4 of the book that strives to teach you a self-education system.  First, the author writes down to the reader like the reader is utterly incompetent, such as the first step in \\"how to read a novel\\" is to \\"look at the title, cover, and table of contents\\"!!!!!   The author seems to say at numerous points that a liberal arts education is overblown and you will just learn to follow the herd, and then in the next sentence proceeds to tell you exactly how you should read a novel in lockstep with the herd.    Different people will take away different impressions and lessons from the \\"classics.\\"  That's the point.  This book is way too touchy-feely while at the same time way too strict in demanding that you follow this 12 step plan.  Buy the book if you want the summaries of what is admittedly a broad and great list of classics, but don't be fooled into thinking it is any form of revolutionary idea or self-education process.  It's really like a pompous professor dryly lecturing you in the privacy of your own home, which does not seem like \\"self education\\" to me.	2005-01-21

It's very short, and can literally be read in several hours.  It may, however, too quickly summarize and not quite put it all together. <BR>The author is obviously an expert in the field and very adept at touching on topics ranging from the status of Arabia in the time of the founding of Islam to political factors in the Soviet / Afghanistan conflict, etc.  But it just feels like maybe the author regurgitated this book to satisfy a timely niche demand on the subject of Islam.  Looking at the list of titles of all his other works, I cannot imagine that this book in any way offers anything new to readers. <BR>That said, it is good for introductory reading.  Consider it like an outline for an academic look at the history of Islam - covers the major points very quickly and moves on, which is OK for some readers but will be a dissapointment to others.	2004-05-10

Compared to similar style volumes in the same price range, I would rate it as exceptional.  The paper and bindings are very high quality and there are some incredible paintings, maps, and photos in the book.  Some of the maps dating to the 15th and 16th centuries are particularly interesting and add a lot to the book.<br />The chapters themselves are divided into rather geographical units.  There are chapters on the explorations of the Indian Ocean routes, the Atlantic routes to America, the Pacific Islands, etc., so it is not a chronological history.  But the presentation works very well and the reader doesn't get lost with the time jumps back-and-forth between chapters.  The author narrates the general explorations, and then includes passages from actual logbooks or subsequent accounts from involved parties.  The result is a very interesting take and unique point-of-view on the first European explorations of America, India, and more.  Many of the paintings included are caricture cartoons of the popular view of the various natives, and they really fit well when placed next to the words of the participants themselves and what they were really thinking.  The author adds just enough commentary to place the logbooks in perspective, but not enough to disrupt the focus of the book with his personal opinions and analysis.	2004-05-10

The reader is privy to inside decision making in the critical months and a view of the government machine in action across China in the period leading up to the massacre and immediately after.  <BR>The main point of this review is to give the opinion that this book is not a suitable introduction to Tiananmen for the novice on this subject.  I have always wanted to read an account of the massacre and the political factors leading up to it, and thought I'd start with this.  My feeling is that without any prior knowledge beyond what everyone has heard, the impact of this book will be lessened somewhat.  Which shouldn't take anything away from the book, only warn novice readers that this might be better put on hold until you've read something else.  The reason is simply the massive amount of unfiltered and not always well-organized information presented.  The book is so dry at times that it is hard to maintain interest, unless in fact questions were being answered that had been nagging at the reader, which is less likely to a new reader in the area.	2004-03-30

That makes the subject matter even more impressive, because it tackles several intertwined themes on a dark period in U.S. history for many reasons.  First, it humanizes ordinary Japanese-Americans who were swept up in the WWII hysteria and had their lives shattered.  You follow a young man as he struggles witht the difficult decision of whether to enlist in the U.S. army, which would spare him internment in the concentration camps out West.  It's a lose-lose situation, because either choice is painful and has harsh consequences.<br />An interesting side theme that often doesn't get discussed is the portrayal of the fiercely pro-Japanese mother who never wavers in her belief that Japanese warships will appear on the West Coast and liberate her family and the rest of her Japanese brethren.  This is interesting because while it certainly doesn't soften what the U.S. did to those groups during the war, it does help explain somewhat one of the justifications used to whip people up into an anti-Japanese frenzy.  The Japanese residents of the West Coast were unlike European immigrant communities on the East Coast in that many Japanese desperately longed to return home and saw living in the U.S. as a temporary solution to economic woes.  Coupled with the fact that in the early part of the war the U.S. was in real danger of losing to the Japanese and facing attacks on the West Coast, the mistrust and resentment of Japanese living here was much greater than the feelings toward German and Italian immigrants at the time.  Again it doesn't justify U.S. actions during the span of this book, but neither do blanket labels of racism get to the root causes of why these camps were established.<BR>  <BR>Overall, this is a powerful book that could be enjoyed as a fictionalized story or a non-fiction history.	2004-03-30

This book does a great job going over the two decades from Israel's founding to the outbreak of war, in brief yet sufficient form.  The Arab countries are disorganized messes unable to even unite based on their hatred of Israel, which is their ultimate downfall.  <BR>In contrast to the waves of Palestenian suicide bombers today, one gets the feeling that the established Arab nations have always really lacked the heart to follow through on their professed desires to see Israel destroyed.  The actions of the Arab leaders during this period are much more concerned with saving face and placating the public than making realistic plans for war.  How else can Israel deal such crippling defeats to several countries at once that have way larger populations and military resources?  In this sense the book does touch on the other major social cause of Middle East unrest today, mainly the warped leadership these countries have had for decades and the result today of widespread poverty, listlessness, and religious fanaticism.  <BR>The book also highlights to what extent Israel really went it alone in this war and up to this point in its history.  While Israel obviously had to buy its limited number of tanks and planes from somewhere, most of the Western countries and the U.S. were loathe to help supply them with a large army.  In contrast, the Soviets did everything they could to funnel arms to the Arab countries and establish a foothold there.  The U.S. seemed to want to hedge its bets, and also provided arms to many of the countries staunchly opposed to Israel.  The view today is that Israel is propped up by the U.S. in military terms, and that if the U.S. ceased to back Israel then their country would be destroyed.  After reading this book it would be very hard to believe that.<BR>Finally, this book helps explain why Israel cracks down on terror the way it does today in such a harsh manner.  For decades they have been surrounded by fanatics who want to destroy them and are just looking for signs of weakness.  While that is somewhat of a cliche, this book illuminates the scope of aggression Israel has faced by giving concrete portraits of the military action.  <BR>The downside I felt to this book was that the prologue was very rushed, and could have devoted at least 10 or 20 pages to discussing the 1973 war and beyond.  In that, the book really rushes through the link it tries to make between 1967 and the Modern Middle East.  The prologue is devoted more to briefly following up on the careers of the major players from 1967 and doesn't even discuss the status of the conquered areas today.	2004-03-28

This one is at least as good, and may be slightly better.  Great short stories are harder to write than novels, and that is why there are so few noteworthy books out there today.  But Jones is fantastic and in complete control of his work.  If there were more writers like this, I would probably stop reading overdrawn novels completely and only read short stories.  <BR>I once loaned this book to a friend who needed to find some short stories to use as models for form, etc. for school, and crossed out 3 of the 10 titles in the table of contents as probably suitable for skipping.  While every collection like this will have its high points, 7 out of 10 seem to be must-read hits to me, and you are looking for too much in a short story collection if you expect more than that - even Hemingway's collections have their duds thrown in.	2004-03-28

What's most impressive is that this book was written before O'Brien had cut his teeth on later more successful books like 'Things They Carried.'<BR>Some reviewers have complained about the distortion caused by the intertwining storylines and shifts in time and focus, but they are not muddled at all and the book is very easy to maintain.  This is what elevates the book beyond mere storytelling or fictionalized factual accounts.  You can read other reviews for a synopsis of the story - my two-cents is that this book lives up to the hype and works to perfection.  O'Brien is one of only two fiction writers still in their 'prime' so to speak and putting out books somewhat regularly that I will look for and buy (other being Phillip Roth).	2004-03-28

While his study of the Spanish war is detailed yet broad and provides a great history in a modest-sized one volume, it just fails to be as gripping or even interesting as 'Stalingrad.'  That could be due to the subject matter, but I don't think so because the Spanish conflict directly preceded WWII and many of the day's powers were substantially involved and had vested interests in the outcome.  <BR>Rather, the canvas of this entire conflict is broader than what Beevor tackled in 'Stalingrad,' and perhaps he is better suited to a more narrow focus.  There are so many competing political factions before and during the war, and competing interests from outside countries, that Beevor seems overwhelmed.  Frequent confustion results where he makes too many presumptions on each and every name being remembered by the reader, etc.<BR>Still a fascinating purely for the amount of information contained in a rather short book.  At least initially, the leftists in this conflict truly endear sympathy for their cause and are one of the few examples in the past century of a communist movement even somewhat capable of evoking sympathy.  By the end, both sides mean nothing but heartache for the future of Spain, and certainly helped stir up the already rumbling war clouds elsewhere.	2004-03-27

I was more than pleasantly surprised.  He has some very interesting and, more importantly, very unique ideas on a variety of social and political issues.  He is incredibly smart and doesn't engage in the pure logical fallacies or rantings that many in this genre do.  While I don't agree with a number of his ideas, they are challenging and require critical thought if you wish to dismiss them.<br />As a simplified example, he raises the point that it is a complete fallacy to retrospectively judge 20th-century socialism as a failure simply by comparing the status of past and present communist countries with capitalist ones.  At the turn of the century, Russia and most of Eastern Europe were extremely backwards in comparison to the West.  He posits that Russia was closer in economic and social development to Brazil than the U.S., and has similar population and natural resources, etc. to Brazil.  Brazil has been under the sphere of U.S. influence the last century, but compare Russia and Brazil today and you cannot roundly say the Russian system failed.  i.e., look at how much technological and scientific and industrial progress Russia made in the twentienth centurya and take a look at Brazil today.  Similarly, it is not proper to compare Eastern European nations to France or England; rather find countries that were comparable in their development when communism was instituted and compare those nations.  If you compare U.S. satellite nations, i.e. nearly all of Latin America, to Soviet satellite nations, today who can really say that Nicaragua or Venezuela is better off than Bulgaria or Hungary?  <BR>This is just one example of an idea that merits consideration and requires you to formulate your own reasons why you may disagree, rather than just denouncing him.  The only reason I would not give the book five stars is that the town-hall style presentation of the materialis distracting and times and makes some chapters a bit rambling.	2004-03-27

Suffice to say that the book is extremely powerful and thought provoking.  Whether or not one agrees with Diamond's conclusions, they are well-established and inspire critical thought.  He has presented some of the simplest answers to questions of monumental historical significance, and the scientific presumption should always be that the simplest answer is most likely correct.  While some reviewers slam Diamond as psuedo-Marxist and completely unbalanced, no competing theories of human development are as compelling as his nor as scientifically substantiated to this point.	2004-03-26

Wong was one of only a handful of Westerners allowed to study in China during the 1970's, and as such her perspective is nearly unparallelled.  Most people really don't much about day-to-day life in China and this makes for a very interesting read.<BR>Her story, however, is so fraught with self-deprecation that it's hard to take her seriously and one must question what really goes on inside her head.  She tells stories of slaving on state farms and in communist machine factories and witnessing horrible societal abuses.  She consistently relates stories of her questioning of her own Maoist faith and how easily she allowed herself to be manipulated by half-wit propaganda agents.  The problem is she never establishes why she was such an ardent socialist and why she so passionately wanted to reject the West.  Rather, she comes across during her time in China as an immature hippie / marxist wannabe brat incapable of any form of advanced thought.  Now that she is 'reformed' and sees those Chinese regimes for what they were, she can write this book.  But the reader is frequently overcome with an urge to shake the author and pull her head out of the sand; since there is no reasonable justification for her actions and why she in fact stuck her head three feet down in the sand, one cannot have much sympathy for Wong and she loses credibility.	2004-03-26

When a conservative black man raised in poverty initiates a frontal assualt on black society in America, too many people will refuse to hear him with an open mind.  Which is a shame, because Hamblin makes more compelling arguments than most black political leaders on many of the root causes of ongoing social turmoil in black America.<BR>Hamblin obviously believes that his background entitles him to lash out on topics that would be politically incorrect suicide for most commentators.  At times he takes it too far and loses focus, and at times the book begins to read like a transcript of his radio show rather than well-organized writing.  And, some of the late chapters lose their zip because they are no longer shocking just to be reading, and digging into their arguments they are really just rehashing the earlier stuff.<BR>That said, some of the chapters will shock, outrage, surprise, and gratify you.  Hamblin is not afraid to say what a lot of people are really thinking.  Even if you disagree with his views, you must accept that they are legitimate and worthy of consideration.  Simply dismissing him is counter-productive and does nothing to address the issues he poignantly raises.	2004-03-26

While not condemning the religion per se, the book should make anyone who reads it seriously question what is going on out in Utah and similar confines and question some of the general policies of that church.  <BR>It's also a frightening example of religious extremism pervading our own backyard; these fundamentalist communities described in this book pose a much more direct and cognizable threat to our country than anyone in the Middle East could ever hope to.<BR>The book is well written and easy to stay hooked on - it was actually rather impressive investigative work and easily surpasses what was a good (albeit overblown) Everest book.	2004-03-26

The Gulag system was frightening in its sophisticated operation and scale.  It illustrates the complete lack of logic, reason, and compassion that human beings are capable of.  <BR>The book is expertly researched and sweeping in its coverage.  The downside to reading it is that rather then being presented as a straight chronological history, some of the chapters are presented by topic instead.  While it generally moves forward, where the chapters jump back and reevaluate a given period from a different perspective, the effect on the reader is rather plodding.	2004-03-26

While sitting on your bookshelf the neon green spine jumps out and the lettering makes it look like some cheesy sci-fi tripe.  Which is unfortunate, because it's a very informative book and full of excellent research.  It's odd that the great flu epidemic got relegated to an historical footnote, because it's scale was devastating and frightening.  It's also likely that sometime in the future a similar outbreak will jump from animal to man in south China or somewhere similar.  And the results today would dwarf the original flu epidemic and make SARS seem like a mild fever.  This book makes for fascinating reading on these counts and it's very interesting to follow how the scientists went back to uncover the flu's origins.<BR>Like many psuedo-historical books of this nature, however, the author is much less skilled as a writer than she is as a researcher.  She tries too hard to inject the book with drama when the subject matter itself is sufficiently dramatic.  Thus reading it becomes irritating at times because the prose and bad melodrama gets to you, but you nonetheless don't want to stop reading and not get all of the information.	2004-03-26

The book does a great job of setting up the brewing tensions in 1914 that caused pandemonium on all sides.  I have long read legions of works on WWII but have not read much on the first war beyond standard accounts such as &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front.&quot;  For a beginning study of WWI history this book is great, and the reader can clearly grasp all the issues and see how the same causes directly to the even greater pandemonioum of WWII.  As the book progresses into accounts of the combat on the various fronts, the writing gets a little plodding to follow at times.  But it is still accessible.  The maps and photographs are first-rate and quite impressive.  There are also numerous insets with brief sidebars on topics such as propaganda posters, women in the factories, etc., that allow the book to serve as a genuine coffee-table book that someone can just pick up for twenty minutes.<BR>This is the type of expensive book that makes it worthwhile to join a low-committment book club such as History Book Club, where you get 4 or 5 books for $1 each and agree to buy one more at regular price and then just cancel.  You can generally find enough excellent expensive books like this that can count as only one choice for the introductory $1 and make it well worthwhile to join, rather than shelling out $35 - $50.	2004-03-26

I devoured his books in junior high and high school, and that's about the level of writer he is. He is very good at what he does, which unfortunately is recycle and regurgigate a good novel in fifteen different forms annually until it degenerates into pure garbage. That said, this is the one work that stands out above the rest. The level of character development, if not higher, is much more interesting than in his typical works, as is the entire grandiose concept of The Stand. Just the sheer imagination that it takes to write and read something like this makes it worthwhile. It's unreal, but also written well enough to make the reader wonder &quot;what if&quot; and give it some element of reality which is necessary to make the work really stand out and grip you.

It gains more relevance since it occurred right in our back yard, albeit in the highly impoverished and very black caribbean island of Haiti that reminds no one of their favorite tour destination. That's also what makes it an interesting read. How much does anybody really know about this tortured little slice of land that, if you live in the right area of the nation, is closer to your front door than New York or Oregon or numerous points in between? The author writes as a journalist, but injects enough humour here and there to liven up the work. The book is very well researched and full of fascinating historical and modern factoids. The culture of Haiti is both comic and fascinating and desperate at once, while the culture of the U.S. military is seen as it really is in these situations - ridiculous. The most powerful military in history intervening in places like Haiti and Somalia and Grenada, albeit in a &quot;peacekeeping&quot; role, really shows what a stupid bunch of apes we let people elect to rule us.	2001-08-24

In that, it was brilliant, but anyone in their twenties really has no business reading this stuff to begin with. It's of course not the Lord of the Rings, rather an imitation, but a pretty good and entertaining one. I read a few of the sequels, and understand there are now too many to count, which is rather a shame. But this one is a thrilling read and loaded with enought imagination and adventure to set it apart from its peers.	2001-08-24

It's expertly written and narrated, it's politically explosive, it's imaginative, and it's blending of the real and surreal could only have been done by such a great writer. It's completely and utterly different from any of the &quot;classics&quot; you have ever read. It's modern and a relic at the same time. There surely are dozens of other reviews outlining the plots and characters of the novel, so let this one just recommend it as a must-read and one of the true masterpieces in all aspects of the word.	2001-08-24

Perhaps it's better to say that novels aren't Thompson's strength.  That said, it's a good book, full of his trademark sarcasm and wit and a funny story.  Anyone who reads Thompson will of course want to read this book and will enjoy it immensely.  However, those who haven't and want to get a taste of Thompson will be ill-advised to begin here.  His best works will always be the offbeat Gonzo Papers collections, and provide the most variety	2001-08-16

That said, it's a moving story and grips the reader with its pain and anguish. But it's also rather poorly written, and were it not for its subject and the time period it came out in, no one would dare call this a &quot;classic.&quot; The author's tone and perspective is muddled and the &quot;Christian&quot; themes she promotes in her characters seem rather ludicrous to me. &quot;Good&quot; slaveholders are warped into demigods filled with &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;refinement,&quot; and it's easy to see why the title character has become such a source of resentment for many people. But, on the other hand, it is what it is and has influenced a great deal of readers and our society in general, and that alone makes it a necessary read. But it can't compare to something like Alex Haley's novel, because she simply isn't on the same par as a writer.	2001-08-16
US	49171909	R3K9REEV1K5PAO	0553258478	734532649	Exodus	Books	3	4	8	N	N	The grueling melodrama ruins what could be outstanding	This book is definitely hit-and-miss.  On the one hand, it is full of fascinating mini-stories of Jews in the aftermath of WWII, and the struggle to establish the state of Israel.  It's great just for the sheer historical value of the many monumental events it depicts, from stragglers emerging from Aushwitz to the first Arab conflicts to the world uproar surrounding the founding of Israel.  The other side is that Uris has created as the main character a ridiculous Superman in the form of Ari that belongs in a comic book and detracts from all the realism that the historical background of the book creates.  He is Godlike as a lover, caregiver, fighter, diplomat, farmer, spy, and anything else he undertakes.  It the featured characters were more human in this otherwise very engaging novel of humanity, it would be five stars.	2001-08-16
US	49171909	R1EAGPH5JJHF	038000321X	399926886	Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors	Books	4	0	0	N	N	The reality drives it home	This is the original action-adventure survival tale, and far better than the self-gratifying Into Thin Air or the generic Perfect Storm.  For one, the soccer players stranded in the Andes really didn't do anything to put themselves in that situation other than getting on the airplane.  They didn't pay untold thousands to climb a mountain they had no business being on or pilot their fishing boat into a hurricane out of sheer stupidity.  In that, it's much easier to feel for the victims and marvel at their ordeal.  You will constantly find yourself thinking about the gravity of their situation and at what point you yourself would begin devouring human flesh.  It's a story that could be great as a work of fiction, but being that it really happened, it's transformed into something amazing and grotesque at the same time.	2001-08-16
US	49171909	R2HGVQWGF29VL5	0767902041	856306137	Tomcat in Love	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Non-combat work shows a different side of O'Brien	Some readers may have a hard time getting into this book just because O'Brien has been so identified as THE guy when it comes to combat, Vietnam, their effects on society and ordinary men, etc.  But there's a score of writers stuck on war-themed novels, and what always elevated O'Brien was that he is such a stronger and more imaginative writer than any of them.  And that hasn't changed just because the genre of this novel has.  It's highly entertaining, if not as socially poignant as his previous works, and expertly written.  Had I read the premise of the story and it was by your average top-selling author of this genre, I wouldn't have given it a second chance.  But it's O'Brien, and he would be hard-pressed to create a bad novel.  The characters are memorable and almost Vonnegut-like in many of their odd traits and quirks.  A good lawn-chair read over a slow weekend that will entertain you without the weight of his usual works.	2001-08-16
US	49171909	R39POLYRWSZMP3	0385334206	739505736	Breakfast of Champions: A Novel	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Vonnegut's most entertaining read	This book doesn't hold quite the weight as &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; or &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; to critics and many readers, but I believe it to be his funniest work without a doubt.  Even thought it doens't make quite a grand of statement as those two books, it nonetheless is filled with brilliant satire and comments on our ridiculous society.  The book may be even stronger because it was probably more difficult to make this subject matter work so well.  The characters are memorable and you won't stop laughing.  Any first-time Vonnegut reader would be doing fine to start here if they aren't as inclined to delve into his science-fiction works, and for those who started with them, you will not be dissapointed with this one.	2001-08-16

It's a different style for him, but works wonderfully.  He does a good job of putting the book in a realistic historical perspective and makes some great statements about war, espionage, the human soul, and misguided racism and politics.  I wouldn't call it his best work, but the worst thing he's written would still warrant at least 4 stars, and this gets 5.	2001-08-16

The short stories range from life in the oppressive border factories pumping out goods for America to the lives of those who control this commerce, to workers entering the U.S. for menial jobs, both with a visa in relative comfort and with nothing to lose in the deserts along the Rio Grande.  This book is ten times more informative, realistic, and well-written than most of the works shoved down a student's throat in any type of ethnic literature or sociology course concerning these issues.  Highly recommended book by Latin America's most overlooked great author, Carlos Fuentes.	2001-08-16

That is more or less what Beevor does in this book. His style is overly dry and technical, but nonetheless loaded with information that is hard to fathom. Anyone with an interest in WWII history or warfare in general will want to pick up this book, chronicling surely the most important battle in the history of mankind. Anyone who still subscribes to the theory that the Americans and Brits made Europe and the world save from fascism will do well to begin here. Had the Germans triumphed at Stalingrad, everyone from the Russians to the Greeks to the war-God French would be speaking German today. The author comes armed with loads of fascinating research, factoids, and statistics that chronicle the build-up throught the aftermath of the battle. Again, it's just too dry in too many parts and also dehumanizes many of the ordinary participants in the siege. The enormous historical importance of this makes the book worth reading, even though in the hands of a better and more inventive writer it could have been twice as good.	2001-08-16
US	49171909	R6DJ4WQ7EOYNW	0080374379	329455826	The Forgotten Soldier: The Classic WWII Autobiography (Brassey's Commemorative Series WWII)	Books	5	4	6	N	N	German or Russian or American, war is war	This book does a good job of humanizing the average German foot soldier who marched off to die in Russia not because he hated Jews and wished to spread fascism to the godless communists, but because he did rather love his country and wish to see it prosper and more importantly, because he had no choice.  Many of them were young and powerless, and like their counterparts, just wanted to go home.  They suffered and cried and went hungry just like Americans did.  The novel is gripping and well written, and really the nationality isn't overly important to the story.  It's much more about confused boys killing and being killed and never really knowing why.  An easy read that's hard to put down.	2001-08-16

Also, like most of his novels, Mexico is full of ridiculously heroic characters that drag the book down into Michener purgatory.  The story goes from fascinating glimpses into Aztec culture and rituals to stories of bullfighters who, while eating dinner, `wield a fork in the graceful manner that only a matador could'.  It's during these sections that you ask yourself why you're wasting your time reading this, but usually the historical stories of the land and cultures reach you just in time to grab your interest and force you to continue reading, albeit at times rather regrettably.	2001-08-16

Anyone who considers themselves remotely interested in reading or literature should read this novel immediately.  Hemingway reached the peak of his craft here, from the storyline to the characters to the prose itself.  It's part war novel, part love story, and part historical documentary of the Spanish Civil War.  All three blend together seamlessly to create a book without any recognizable flaws.	2001-08-16

He is sick, depraved, perverted, cruel, and highly entertaining.  He probably also exists in many forms in Modern America more than we would like to think about.  This novel has exactly zero literary merit, but nonetheless deserves its five stars for the sheer lecherousness of it.  You can read it in a few hours and be none the worse for wear because of it.	2001-08-16

However, he deserves his place among them and may perhaps be better. &quot;Making Waves&quot; displays the writer's usual quick wit and sarcasm as he muses over everything from Peru's Shining Path to Hemingway to Rastafari to Che.  It's a collection of essays spanning many decades, and often they are merely his take on a particular social, political, or literary trend.  The book makes for enjoyable reading in bits and pieces.  A highly intelligent work!	2001-08-14

The idea that Guevera didn't die and that Castro ultimately gives up power and all the consequences following is quite tantalizing. But it's just too far fetched to be taken seriously, especially when the narration focuses on the thoughts and musings of Guevara. Che is warped into some type of soap opera character coming out of hiding to reclaim Cuba, and the story also fails in large part because of the awful dialogue. Every time Che appears in the story and you are forced to read the dreadful dialogue you almost become angry at the author. The writer seems to have done some good research and has some great imagination, but just can't put it all together and write it. I had great expectations for this book and was more dissapointed than I had been in a long while.	2001-08-14

But that's what makes this book great.  He does a good job of transporting the reader into the lives of nobody important but who are filled with great dreams and aspirations.  And there's enough intelligence and political and social commentary to elevate it beyond the typical hack drama and movie of the week dribble that books like this often are.  It won't change the world, but it's an engaging and enjoyable read.	2001-08-14

The only downside is that, being over forty years old, much of the &quot;science&quot; half of the science-fiction seems a little more absurd than it must have when it first appeared.  But as a societal satire it still can't be beat.  This book may not be the best place to start for someone unfamiliar with his other works, but is a must read for anyone who has enjoyed his other classics.	2001-08-14

It does this through good personalized accounts as well as broad perspectives on the history and nature of the three-sided war.  The only thing keeping the book from getting five stars is that at times it's tough to take Loyd's wandering chapters about his ... addictions and family traumas.  By seeking the reader's sympathy and approval, he somewhat demeans the much greater tragedies unfolding throughout the narrative.  Beyond that, though, it was a chilling and highly informative work that any reader would take something out of.	2001-08-14
