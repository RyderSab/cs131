Not about design, or the elements of design, or how various design elements might be used either separately or in conjunction to evoke feelings or images.  <br />The book is broken into sections, one for each design element such as color, texture, etc.  The first page of each section is a very general description of that design element.  This is then followed by 15 pages or so of full-page pictures highlighting that design element.  Looking at 15 pages of colorful objects or highly textured objects may be mildly interesting but it isn't terribly informative or useful.  <br />This book may be marginally adequate if you just want to flip through the pictures looking for inspiration.  But the pictures are largely mediocre and too few to really exhaust the topics at hand so it isn't even terribly useful as inspiration.  No matter what your needs or purpose you would do well to pass on this book and look for something better.	2004-02-12

This book is a marvel of efficiency as he covers topic after topic in highly succinct fashion.  While keeping each section brief, he manages to teach a lot in the clearest way possible.<br />Many tips on how to get correct exposure and strong composition are in here as well as techniques for macro photography.  Also, a significant portion of the book is devoted to considerations when purchasing equipment and the information is invaluable.  <br />As others have pointed out, the equipment he favors is not cheap but some seem to miss the entire point of those chapters.  Shaw does not give the reader a shopping list.  He discusses the pros and cons of various equipment and encourages you to weigh the trade-offs to develop your own equipment list.  Since much of the better equipment is expensive, this may mean rationing your money to get the best bang for the buck.<br />This is an excellent book.  It covers a variety of topics with a rare clarity that makes it a must have for any serious photographer.	2003-12-20

There are a number of truly beautiful images scattered throughout the 112 pages.  <br />Unfortunately, many of the pictures are considerably less impressive.  Some are extremely grainy and unattractive, some aren't well focused, and still others look like they have been shot using color-altering filters to poor effect.  In addition, there is a heavy preponderance of sunset/dusk shots.  Dusk is a great time to shoot photos, but when one technique is used in such great repetition in a single collection of photos the effect becomes monotonous and the photographer begins to look like a one-trick pony.<br />The author is an experienced photographer and is obviously capable of producing very good work.  Sadly, he too often settles for shots that are not worthy of publication in a book like this.  The uneven quality of the photos makes it impossible to recommend this book.	2003-12-11

It is written to help give you a chance to get great shots of northern California landmarks.  It not only points out the best locations from which to take pictures but also provides other info such as which time of day proviides the best lighting.<br />On a recent trip to SF I got some amazing shots of the Golden Gate Bridge from places I would never have known even existed without this book.  It shows you perspectives from several different locations for each landmark so you can choose your favorite.

The book is well written, very clear, and has a tremendous amount of information.  It covers hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc.  The authors provide several possible itineraries depending on what kind of trip you want and how long you intend to stay.  In short, the book is an excellent tool to help you plan your entire trip.  <br />The only drawback is that there are no pictures at all and SF is a visually exciting and diverse city.  When deciding what you want to visit, a picture or two could go a long way in deciding what is a must see and what is not.  For example, I had never heard of the Palace of Fine Arts but when I saw a picture of it in another book I knew I had to go there.  This is an excellent book but it would be better still if they could add some color photos in the next edition.	2003-03-07

While the book does a decent job of condensing descriptions for the top attractions it can't begin to offer any real coverage of hotels and restaurants in its 96 pages.  <br />Practically speaking, you will need a full sized guide to do any serious trip planning and if you get one of those then the need for the Citypack is limited at best.  The map is useful but you can buy a roadmap separately for far less money.  The plastic cover that is supposed to make it easy to carry is wrapped so tightly that you can barely get the book out and getting it back in without destroying it is almost impossible.  Overall, this is a product with some helpful information but not enough to make it a must when planning a trip.	2003-03-07

The strategies offered for avoiding long lines at the theme parks are spot-on. The book also gives descriptions and ratings of every ride and attraction at each park. The descriptions are almost too detailed (if you want any surprises) and their ratings are sometimes a bit generous. Still, the material is quite helpful in deciding which rides to make sure you see and what can be skipped if time is short.<br />All in all this is an excellent book that was extremely helpful to me on my trips to Orlando. The writing is clear and concise, the information is organized logically, and the information is accurate and useful.	2003-02-26

He is impatient, domineering, egotistical, and almost certainly there are other unflattering things you could say about him.  Yet he is a true rarity in my mind because he tells you he is all of those things repeatedly in his own autobiography.  He does a fantastic job of honestly outlining the major events of his life.  He acknowledges the things he has done well but spends far more time detailing his excesses and failings as well as being generous in giving credit for his success to others.  <br />What makes this book so interesting is that it is neither a tearful apology nor a chest-thumping self congratulation.  Cramer matter of factly details his journey to success as well as the toll it took on his personal life including his utter insensitivity in dealing with his family.  <br />The passages dealing with His wife alone are worth the price of the book.  The woman is nothing short of amazing both as the &quot;Trading Goddess&quot; that truly lives up to her name as well as the woman who puts up with a workaholic husband that is virtually never around when she needs him.<br />All in all, this is a fascinating book that anyone would do well to read.	2003-01-07

If the name Golightly sounds somewhat contrived to your ear as it does to mine then you might not be shocked to learn that the character seems just as contrived and unrealistic.  Holly is meant to be one of those exceptional people who breeze through life on sheer force of personality, oozing charisma and eccentric charm.  Unfortunately, she never quite rings true.  Her dialog is just a bit too breezy and her manner a touch too above-it-all.  She's such a stereotype of this type of person that she comes across as more of parody than a real person.<br /><br />Breakfast at Tiffany's is not awful by any means.  Capote is a master wordsmith and at times his prose is compelling enough to draw you into the story.  Unfortunately, there are too many moments that don't quite ring true to make this a must read.  If you want to try Capote for the first time I would recommend [[ASIN:0679745580 In Cold Blood]].  It is a far better book with much more substantial characters.	2002-08-22

His life prior to joining GE receives all of 1 chapter.  After that is a description of his rise to the top and several of the major deals and initiatives that helped make his reputation as one of the great CEOs of the 20th century.  <br />Unfortunately, one book is insufficient to go into a meaningful level of detail and tell the stories of all these different events in a compelling way.  Consider that whole books such as &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; focus on individual similar acquisitions or initiatives to tell the story well.  One chapter each for huge subjects like the attempted Honeywell acquistion just doesn't cut it.  What you get is a brief outline of the events including the list of people who helped him move the initiative forward.  He will then tell you what these people went on to accomplish in their careers.  You won't care, though, because you never get to know these men in a meaningful way.  They are just names.  Almost every person in this book is two dimensional including Jack himself.<br />I've followed Jack Welch's career in the pages of Business Week and other publications virtually his entire time as chairman of GE.  I was expecting to learn about the man behind those stories.  Instead, I read a rehash of those stories with very little additional detail.  His family life and divorce are given almost no mention.  Indeed, any difficult or defining moments on a purely personal level are few and far between here.<br />I would only recommend this book if you know very little about Mr. Welch and are interested in his career and accomplishments.  It is not a management textbook, nor is it much of a biography.  It simply skims the surface of the career of perhaps the greatest CEO of the 20th century.	2002-07-29

The text does a decent job of briefly discussing various topics although it is far from comprehensive.  In the section covering fabrics and upholstery, for example, I was a bit shocked to see that leather is never even mentioned (nor does it appear in the index).  Unfortunately, this type of omission is typical.  By trying to cram every decorating topic under the sun into 400 pages there is no subject that really gets the attention it deserves.  <br />Perhaps the biggest problem with this book is that it has such a strong &quot;house style&quot; that, despite their lip service to different styles, most of the rooms seem to end up looking remarkably similar.  Virtually every room has either a loud floral print or a large vase of flowers dominating the room.  And lots of clutter is usually found keeping those florals company.  <br />For those who love the country cottage style, I can see this book offering a treasure trove of great ideas and photos.  For those like myself who prefer a cleaner, more contemporary feel there is little here of interest.  The text is occasionally useful but the discussion on each topic is too shallow to provide a real blueprint.  Overall, this book was a real disappointment.	2002-06-29

At my peak, I struggled to bowl over 140 in a game and more recently as a very occasional bowler it was all I could do to crack 110.  After reading this book, I decided to focus on just a few of the most basic issues such as how to hold the ball, how to aim correctly, etc. to see what it would do for me.<br />The results were dramatic.  After struggling for a game to adjust to the new mechanics my score shot up by 40 pins the next game.  Even more amazing, I didn't bowl again for 6 months, then went out and shot a 177 which was the best score of my life.  If I hadn't tightened up the last 2 frames I would have broken 200.  <br />An essential primer in the fundamental mechanics of bowling, this book is a great resource for recreational or beginning bowlers.

Honestly, even if you have learned the concepts for a chapter through another source this book can be hard to follow.  <br />Want an example of the murky text?  Try this typical run-on sentence quoted directly from the book.  &quot;In the same way, the normal random variable is an abstraction, because in theory any numerical value, negative as well as positive, is possible, and the probability histogram is a smooth, symmetric, bell-shaped curve.&quot;  Try stringing together 800 pages of similar prose and you have an idea what awaits you here.<br />I watched an entire class including the professor disown this book because it was useless.

It's routinely called one of the best stories ever published in the comic book genre.  For those of us who didn't fall in love with it all those years ago, does it live up to the hype?  Not quite in my eyes, but it's an excellent story that is well worth buying, reading, and re-reading.<br />\\"The Watchmen\\" is set in a unique universe where superheroes have been banned and the world is on the brink of nuclear war.  The story starts off as a murder mystery and grows into a tale of truly epic proportions.  Alan Moore paints a largely dark picture of humanity and weaves a story that is so intricate it absolutely demands your full attention.  The characters are far from stereotypical or shallow.  Everyone from the heroes to a street vendor seems real and three-dimensional.<br />At the same time, what was very edgy and groundbreaking in the 80's isn't quite as revolutionary today.  It's thought provoking and an excellent story that runs much deeper than almost anything else you can find in comics today.  Just don't buy it thinking this is the ultimate thing you could ever read... it's \\"only\\" excellent.	2002-06-06

Some of it is very quantitative and objective but a good deal of it is personal opinion.  The opinions are what allow the book to offer far more depth than the Places Rated Almanac but they also make for a somewhat unreliable set of &quot;facts.&quot;  What I like best about the book is that it touches on almost every aspect of living in each of the cities profiled.  Medical care, the job market, recreational opportunities, and much more are explored.  <br />Because a lot of the information is anecdotal in nature, however, your mileage could vary considerably from the people they spoke to.  I have visited multiple cities they list in the book and found that beauty was very much in the eye of the beholder.  This book is a worthwhile resource but don't just jump in and assume that their recommendation will mean you would enjoy living there.  <br />If you are considering moving, I would suggest purchasing both this book and the Places Rated Almanac to draw up a short list of candidates.  Then go there and do as many things as possible that you would if you lived in that city.  Go to a movie, check out the local mall, look at a few houses, etc.  Get an idea of what it's like to be there on a daily basis.  You won't get that from this book or any other but Fabulous Places just might help you find a place to start looking.	2002-06-05

The Firm is certainly an engrossing read and the story zips along at a good pace.  Grisham does a nice job of building tension and suspense as events progress and the book is quite successful as a page turning thriller.<br />If The Firm has a weakness, it's that none of the characters are very well developed.  There are many ethical and emotional dilemmas raised during the story yet we seldom learn how Mitch feels about them other than him finding a pragmatic solution to escape the trouble he's in.  He fears the consequences of his actions and situation but if working for the mob troubles him in and of itself the reader really doesn't see it.  All in all this is a good book that is well written and fast paced.  But only buy it if you're looking for a mental version of a light snack... there's no food for thought here.	2002-05-07

If you want to see a lot of action and fight scenes, Astro City is definitely not the series for you to read.  This compilation presents compelling tales about people who seem very real and happen to live in a violent, colorfully costumed world.  <br />Astro City itself is a rich setting with a lot of references to other heroes and events that would be worthy of a long established universe such as Marvel or DC.  You'll meet Samaritan and discover how precious time is to a hero with the power of Superman.  And a story featuring Crackerjack shows that not all &quot;heroes&quot; are truly worthy of the name.  In addition, there are stories told from the perspective of ordinary people whose lives are affected by these larger than life figures.<br />Life in the Big City gets my highest recommendation.

We often say things that come across as hurtful to those we care about whether we mean it that way or not.  Gray tries, and mostly succeeds, to give us a way to break the harmful patterns we're so used to and start relating to each other in a more respectful way.  <br />I can virtually guarantee that if you read &quot;Men are From Mars...&quot; you are likely to see many many arguments and/or problems that you've had in current and past relationships laid out almost verbatim.  Fortunately, along with those examples he also offers advice on how to prevent them from ever happening or resolve them if they do.<br />I'm not going to pretend that every word in here is solid gold and some of his examples of positive dialog actually did make me laugh because they were so over the top.  The bottom line here, though, is that there is some very helpful information here that we can all learn from.

These are not stereotypes, or shallow charicatures.  Somehow, Capote seems to have captured their true natures and distilled them down into words that allow us experience them.  As I progressed through the book, I found myself caring more and more what happened to these people until I couldn't bear the thought of the Clutters dying let alone the horrible details.<br />This book is so engrossing and so very real that virtually any reader will find it powerful and compelling.

Faced with the desire to decorate a new home and overwhelmed with the choices of color, I was hoping to find a palette that would work for me. In actuality, it's unlikely you'll find a palette that matches your tastes so perfectly that you'll choose to use the exact tones offered in the examples. What you will find is a collection of 50 palettes that should help give you some idea which color combinations are most pleasing both to your eye and are approved by a professional decorator. While you might not want the exact green and yellow in the example, you might learn that you really like the combination and you can start trying to find the shades you do want.<br />Where this book really falls short is in helping you take that next step. The pictures are too few to help you visualize the possibilities. Worse, each palette gets one page of text to describe it and its possibilities. Without fail, the first half of the page (at least) is taken up with flowery prose describing the natural setting that inspired the palette. This leaves a paragraph or so to describe the rooms best suited to the palette and advice on how to implement it. The book badly needs more details on this area and the author should either add another page of text for each palette or replace the nature guide material with more practical information.<br />When I finished this book, I felt like the color palettes were the result of years of experience but the book itself might have been produced in a week. This book is useful mostly as an idea generator and given its relatively low price it might well be worth the money to pick it up on that basis alone. I can't say it's the best color book I've purchased, but it did ultimately help me get to my personal color palette.	2002-04-07

While they offer several recipes for each basic color, it is still an extremely limited color palette to work with.  Worse, the blue section is extremely weak as most of the colors have a decidely purple tinge despite the fact that purple gets its own section.  There are some nice colors in here, however, and people interested in making their own colors might do well to buy this book.<br />Perhaps most helpful to me were the brief discussions of each color and their best uses in the home.  This includes a feng shui section for those who are interested in that.  <br />Finally, the book also contains examples of which colors go well together which is a nice idea.  At the same time, many of the example photos of these supposedly compatible combos are quite garish and ugly from my perspective (unlike some other color books that I've read recently) so its actual usefulness is limited at best.<br />In summary, this book is probably best for those who want to mix their own paint and perhaps want to learn about the feng shui characteristics of individual colors.  Neither topic is explored exhaustively, however, and prospective buyers might do well to look for more comprehensive guides on these topics.	2002-04-07
