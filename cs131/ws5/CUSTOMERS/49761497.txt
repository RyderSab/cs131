Her story caught my attention as Leni R. was about the only person still alive who had participated in some close way in the events of the IIWW and the Third Reich.<br />Now I have no doubt in my mind that she indeed was a personal supporter and admirer of Hitler. Never ever she regreted the fact that she colaborated in a way (her films) with the Third Reich. This alone is a reason enough to apologize, and Leni not only never did, but she insisted she had nothing to apologize for.	2004-01-16

I am a &quot;Sex and the City&quot; fan. My husband and I have watch the T.V. serie for years, we have also bought the first and second season on DVD to watch it again. Thats why we bought the book. <BR>It turn out to be boring and poorly written. The worst of all was the third story, I had to make a great effort to finish it. <BR>Its almost amazing how someone can do so well in one thing and at the same time so bad on another one.<BR>Well, I guess I will keep watching my favorite &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and forget I ever read this book.	2002-01-04

I liked this other book from him, although I do not understand his critics to the Russian climber, whom to me was a hero in the hole tragedy.<BR> Anyways,in this book I clearly got the feeling of what might have happened to Chris McCandless,as well as to other characters on this book.<BR>  I think sometimes people overvalue superficial things. I personally love to get disconected from the city.<BR> Ive seen many people looking for an answer, a reason to exist, a diferent way of living. Some find it in religion, others travelling constantly. However, the tipical critisism to them will be to catalog them as disfunctional for not accepting the typical american values as their own. Please let live!! (but carefully)<BR> I agree with Chris McCandless in that if you do not accept and dont want to live under so many rules and laws you dont necessarly have to. But then find a way of life that suts you and dont fight the system hiding and living irresponsably.<BR> I guess my only critic to this book is the personal story on the autor s climb to mount McKinley in Alaska. As this book was not about him, this story turned out to be extremly long and detailed.	2001-09-02

There are many books about holocoust survivors during the war years and inmediatly after, but there ae not many who talk about this subject in a totally setting (miami) and 50 years after the war, wich makes th book interesting. <BR> Unfortunatly I think this book is more about police,detectives and shooting than anything else.<BR> However, I think the book repeats the same information already given to the reader over and over which makes it a little boring.<BR> Being spanish my first language, I would like to tell the author that the idea of including spanish sentences and words every now and then is not a bad idea, however please have it check out by a native speaker because the number of grammar mistakes is amazing!!!	2001-09-02
