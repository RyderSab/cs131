However, being the loyal fan that I am I started to read it and boy was I surprised!  The characters in the book were well developed and their lives expressed so vividly that you could picture their faces, where and how they lived.  This book really took me with the characters.

Lolita, girl you shole' can  write, fo real!  I laughed out loud reading some of those lines!  When I  finished this book, I was full, ready to just bust with emotion, when it  seemed that Dandre wasn't going to take Reesy back I thought I was going to  die!!!  Whew! that was too close!

The book was  completely flat from beginning to end. I would say the most exciting part  was the pregnancy and even that was just like.... over???  I couldn't  really figure out what this girl's problem was?  What could have may her so  bitter, Astor?  Well, probably but the author didn't explore enough of the  happening at Astor to show that to the reader.  None of the relationships  with Malcolm, David, Travis, Stephanie, for that matter, any of them were  explored, resolved, or thought out.  I think the relationship with  Stephanie could have been much more powerful had it not been lightly  brushed over.  I gave this book 1 star, instead of no stars, because the  mother's character reminded me of so many mothers I know.	2000-08-03

I could totally relate to their  friendship/sisterhood. <br />While reading the book I could see these people  in my neighborhood, at my church, on my job, everywhere.  The author does a  excellent job making you know these characters through her descriptions,  word and attitudes.  <br />The relationship between Regina and Charles was  detailed enough not to overwhelm you, but give you a strong sense of how  much they loved each other and how Charles broke through to Regina's heart  and soul.  And the love making at the hotel...WHEW!  Is all I can say!  It  nothing like reading a tastefully, yet trashy at times, well written book  on the train to work everyday! <br />READ THIS BOOK!

Maybe that is part of the sequel?  But  overall, the book is an attention holding, great read! <br />I definitely  could see a screenplay in this book, but who would play Imagany?  I think  Malinda Willians or Regina King could play Caprice.  Boris Kodjoe  (Soulfood, the series) could play Elliott.  I could picture Mekhi Pfiefer  playing Carl.  I say go for it Robyn!
