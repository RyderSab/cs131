It is written in a clear, concise prose, and although it is loaded with facts and anecdotes it is never dry.  Morgan starts out by describing the peopling of North America via the Bering land bridge.  Then he moves into the stories of the European explorers and early settlers, and how they deal with the Native Americans.   After many hardships and failures, the Spanish end up with permanent settlements in the south, the French in the north and the English on the Atlantic Coast.  Morgan then describes the emergence of the Americans and how they eventually dominate the continent and displace Europeans and Native Americans alike.      I highly recommend this if you enjoy American history.	2004-09-30

I was happy to see the wizards back in action in this always entertaining Discworld series.  I have always thought the wizards (along with the witches) are among the funniest characters.  Pratchett has crafted an interesting story set in the land-down-under, a story about gods and creation and the blending of past and present, as Rincewind tries to save the continent from a massive drought.  As usual, Rincewind falls into things (literally and figuratively), but despite the familiar Rincewind antics, Pratchett keeps this novel fresh and, as with all of his books, sharply satirical.  There are so many one line zingers I am sure I missed some, but I found his commentary on university life to be exceptionally funny.  I do not think this is a good place to start into the Discworld novels, but for Pratchett fans, you don't want to miss it.	2004-09-10

This is an original and well-written science fiction novel that jumps back and forth from Ancient Greece to the far future.  Not only is it a richly imagined story of the future, but it also provides you with a refreshing insight into the main characters of Homer's Iliad.  <br />Simmons combines chariots and spaceships, robots and Greek Gods, Earth and Mars, the moons of Jupiter and prehistoric Indiana, into an epic tale of mankind, past and future.  This novel (and hopefully its sequel) should stand the test of time as one of the classic science fiction novels of this generation.	2004-06-25

But despite all that, the book is a fun, fast-paced, enjoyable crime novel.  Cole is an easy-to-like wisecracking hero with a heart of gold.  Pike is the cold, matter of fact, partner that you can always rely on.  In this novel, Cole and Pike are hired by an egotistical and pompous movie director to locate his ex-wife and son.  Finding her isn't much trouble, but then Cole decides to help her and learns that she is in a terrible predicament.  Cole and Pike eventually run into the NY mob, and from there the story blisters towards a satisfying (and very violent) conclusion.  I highly recommend this for fans of the hard-boiled PI genre.	2004-01-23

It is a grim and depressing story about the harsh realities of inner city life.  Sex, drugs and racism are all a part of this story.   Pelecanos portrays two characters, Quinn and Strange, who are trying to do the right thing in a place where right and wrong do not seem to matter much. Both characters are complex and flawed, and amongst the most interesting in all of crime fiction.    <br />The book is well written, and expertly plotted.  The conclusion may not satisfy you, but it is memorable if not haunting.  Hell to Pay is a top-notch crime novel and I highly recommend it.	2003-10-30

Perhaps I expected too much, but the book seemed cartoonish, reminding of an R-rated Scooby episode, the ending notwithstanding.  The story is original and Laymon does a good job depicting the rural 60's setting.  The characters are interesting, but their actions are sometimes puzzling and not believable.  At times the teenagers acted like 10-year-old kids.  If you are a big fan of vampire novels I think you should read this, but otherwise I can't recommend it.	2003-10-22

He does a good job in depicting DC, and his plot is intricate and fast paced.

The second Cornwell novel I have read, and I thought it was spectacular!  A couple years after the setting of Sharpe's Tiger, Sharpe is now a Sergeant with aspirations of moving up into the ranks of the commissioned.  The characters and setting are brilliant.  The depiction of the battle is suspenseful and detailed without being boring.  Not only will you be entertained, but also you will learn some history and about some famous historical characters.  A superbly told tale that leaves you immensely satisfied.  I can't wait to read on in this series. Highly recommended for anyone who likes history or adventure.	2003-02-06

Angels Flight, a suspenseful tale of murder and police corruption in Los Angeles, a city on the brink of imploding, is one of Connellys best.  As usual, the characterizations are superb. Bosch and gang are memorable in the pursuit of a murderer that could be from their own ranks and the depiction of LA is atmospheric and grimly realistic.

It was entertaining and fast paced, but it felt a little too much like a \\"made for TV\\" movie.  There are some funny scenes, but I thought a lot of it was just silly.  <br />You will get a pretty good sense of Seattle and suburbs, and Waterman is an interesting PI.  But there isn't enough here to have me rush out and get the next in the series.  There is too much better stuff out there.

This was a superb novel and easily one of the best works of fantasy I have read in many years. Game of Thrones is a massive epic story set in an imaginary world that resembles Europe in the middle ages.  The story centers on key members of the prominent \\"houses\\" (a.k.a. clans) that are competing for power.  It is a story of intrigue, suspense, adventure, romance, murder mystery, and coming of age, all rolled into one great absorbing novel. There are heroes you will love, enemies you will hate, and a host of others in between.<br />A warning: at over 800 pages this book (the first of several to come) is a big investment.  It is not fast reading; there are numerous characters to keep track of, and the scope of the novel is huge.  Thankfully, Martin gives us a helpful appendix that lists the major families and their members.  In the first few hundred pages I found myself flipping back to the appendix regularly. But it does not take long to become familiar with the players, and your investment soon pays off.  I am completely hooked, and I can't wait to read the rest of this magnificent and complex tale.  I highly recommend this for all readers of fiction.	2002-09-09

This was my first experience with Bernard Cornwell, and I was most satisfied!  Sharpe's Tiger is the first chronologically in the career of Richard Sharpe.  He is a private in the British army and the action takes place in India around 1799.  Cornwell is a good writer, and the story is superb.  There are shades of Indiana Jones, as Sharpe is a resourceful and immensely likeable hero.  There is adventure, suspense and superb characterizations.  It was one of the most fun books I have read in a while, and I can't wait to read the next installment.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes history or adventure.	2002-07-10

Burke maintains his usual high standard in this complicated and disturbing crime novel.  Like always, the novel is loaded with atmosphere and interesting, fully evolved characters.  Burke eloquently portrays the violence and injustice that lurks beneath the surface of our world.  His world is a dark place in which in many people have not progressed beyond the mentality that existed in the pre-civil war era.  <br />In Sunset Limited there are many crimes that needs to be solved.  You need to pay attention or you could easily get lost.  I thought the story suffered a little because of its slight lack of focus, and for this reason I don't think it was as good as some of his previous books.  But overall, it was a gripping and well-written crime novel that is clearly a cut above the genre.	2002-06-17

The Cadfael novels were all finely written and satisfying as mysteries and historical novels.  In this last installment, there is a murder mystery, but Cadfael ends up solving much more than a crime.  In fact, the crime solving aspect is a small part of this story that mostly surrounds the relationships between a father and an estranged son.  I think most fans will agree that it isn't one of the best three or four, but it was very good, and is a fitting conclusion to the Cadfael story.	2002-05-31

It has been a long time since I read a top-notch mystery novel from someone other than by one of my favorite authors (a short list that includes Lawrence Block and James Lee Burke among others).  Pelecanos has written a stylish and gritty PI novel set in the lesser-known parts of DC.  He introduces two new and very interesting characters, and I hope we will be seeing much more of them in the future.  <br />The novel is loaded with atmosphere, much like Block does for NYC.  It is well written and moves along at just the right pace.  It is a story about perceptions and betrayals, and Pelecanos cleverly portrays the gray areas that exist between right and wrong, black and white, and love and friendship.  I highly recommend this novel for anyone who likes to read fiction.	2002-04-24

It is a comprehensive look at the various civilizations that rose and fell from the Sumerians to the Romans.  Starr gives you the big picture and puts the contributions of the ancient world in perspective.  <br />It is written in a clear and concise prose style.  There is just the right amount of attention to detail, but not so much as to make it tedious. It was enjoyable to read and I am happy to have this book in my library to keep for future reference for my children and myself.	2002-03-20

Bosch, one of the most interesting and compelling crime stoppers in the genre, is a sort of Dirty Harry with an even darker side.  Trunk Music has a strong plot with nice twists and plenty of surprises.  As always, Connelly does a superb job at portraying that gray area between good guys and bad guys.  Once again Bosch is being investigated by IAD, but the telling line of the novel is Bosch's: \\"Who polices the police who police the police?\\"  Things wrap up a little too neatly at the end, but otherwise I highly recommend this book.  I rank it a little behind some of Connelly's earlier novels, but it still stands out amongst today's best crime fiction.	2002-03-06

This was my first trip into the world of Inspector Morse, and I am happy to say that it was well worth it.  I can see how Morse has become one of the most beloved crime solvers in the genre.  <br />There are plenty of plot twists and several suspects in this case, and you need to pay attention. But Dexter is a fine writer and although you may sometimes feel puzzled, you are never confused.  The story moves along at a perfect pace and is brought skillfully to a satisfying conclusion.  <br />It was a wonderful mystery novel and I am looking forward to reading about the further exploits of Inspector Morse.	2002-01-24

If you want to be picked up and dropped in the jungles of Vietnam in the middle of a major operation, then read this book.  It was one of the best Vietnam War books I have ever read. Written with both detail and compassion for all involved, it is a brilliant portrayal of the soldiers who fought in the \\"boonies\\" during that horrible war.  Unlike many Vietnam novels that concentrate heavily on the psychological effects of fighting an invisible enemy, this novel is also about the military aspects of the war, and makes the often-overlooked point that our military had some brilliant successes brought about by the heroic actions of the thousands of valiant soldiers who fought the battles.  I highly recommend this dramatic and finely written novel.	2002-01-09

As entertaining as always, there is an added layer of depth to this one as Parker explores the relationships between father and son.  There is an interesting parallel between the Spenser/Paul relationship and the Joe Broz/Gerry Broz relationship.  <br />If you are looking for Spenser the \\"private investigator\\" you only get about half of the equation.  There is plenty of \\"private\\" stuff, but not much of an \\"investigation\\" as Spenser and Paul go about the relatively easy task of finding Paul's mom who has been missing for a couple of weeks.  But you DO get plenty of what we love the most: Spenser wit, Spenser justice, and Hawk, too.	2001-11-08

Written in the mid-eighties, the book describes in chilling detail the nightmare of the times, i.e., nuclear holocaust. Some of the background events may be a bit outdated, but in light of the recent terrorist attacks we know there is still the threat of mass destruction. So my point is that the book is still pretty darn scary!  The first couple of hundred pages that describe the nuclear attack and immediate aftermath are terrifying.  The horrors that are described throughout the book are gruesome.  America has become a scorched and barren landscape.  The survivors miraculously scratch out an existence and somehow keep alive the hope of a future in which the sun will shine again and the land will bear fruit again. Ultimately, the story is about the struggle between good and evil, and how the stress of tragic events brings out the best in some and the worst in others.  <br />For a book of over 900 pages, it is a surprisingly fast read, and there are no lulls.  McCammon is a superb storyteller who has created memorable characters and a detailed setting.  Swan Song is a great book that I think ranks along side The Stand, which for years has stood as my favorite horror novel.	2001-11-06

We know from reading the prologue that Kenzie and Gennaro are about to go through a harrowing experience.  Still, I was not prepared for the chilling and gruesome events that unfold. There are many twists and turns as Lehane sustains a high level of suspense throughout. The writing is very good, although not flawless, and the mystery is well plotted.  There are little details here and there that seem implausible, but they are easily overlooked under the sheer weight of the narrative. <br />I was mildly disappointed in the first Lehane novel (A Drink Before the War) mostly because it seemed like Kenzie was too much of a cheap imitation of Spenser, and the writing seemed a bit amateurish at times (but I still thought it was very entertaining and a good introduction into a new series.)  In this one, though, Lehane seems more confident as a writer and Kenzie has become a much more realistic and convincing character. Angie Gennaro is a wonderful character that you cant help but fall in love with.  With this novel, Lehane has definitely become one of my must read authors.  Highly recommended!	2001-10-05

If you want to be picked up and plopped down on a British Navy Sloop during the Napoleon wars, then pick this book up and get ready!  O'Brian writes and convincing and detailed novel about Captain Aubrey and his friend, the physician, Stephen Maturin.  This was a superbly crafted introduction to what I expect will be a long and enjoyable series.  You don't need to know anything about boats or sailing (I sure don't!) to enjoy this book.  Stephen Maturin knows as little as anyone, and through his experience we are educated about the workings of the ship, from the topsails down to the lowest holds.  <br />There is a very good story here about the maturing of the Captain and the relationships that are tested when thrown together in tight confines for lengths of time.  I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to move on to Post Captain.	2001-09-28

The story revolves around the mysterious death of President Harding, who, on the night of his death attended and participated in Carter's magic show.  Carter then becomes the target of a secret service investigation. The novel goes back and forth in time, from Carter's childhood to the surprising resolution of the mystery surrounding Harding.<br />Gold colorfully brings to life San Francisco/Oakland of the time.  He has fun with the secret service and sheds a new light on one of the least respected presidents ever.  He spins an interesting mystery tale while giving an insightful study into a character that will learn to see past the illusions he has created around his life. <br />All in all a very entertaining and meaningful debut novel that deserves the praise and attention that it has been getting.	2001-09-28

This is a true gem of a novel that is a masterpiece of two genres, mystery and historical fiction. It is a superbly written, skillfully plotted novel set during the early stages of the Civil War when the North still hadnt realized the enormity of the situation it faced. Owen Parry brilliantly brings to life the era with his detailed and unglamorous portrayals of Washington and Philadelphia. <br />Abel Jones, a wounded Civil War hero, is as interesting a protagonist as any I have ever read in mystery fiction. He has to find his way through corruption, racism and deception to get to the bottom of the murder of a well-loved abolitionist. Along the way, he meets up with several notable figures from the war, including General McClellan and Abe Lincoln himself. There are several twists and the plot moves along at a perfect pace, all leading up to a powerful conclusion. <br />I have read many Civil War books, both fiction and nonfiction, and this easily ranks along side such memorable favorites as The Killer Angels and A Stillness at Appomattox. If you are a fan of mystery and/or historical fiction you must read this novel.	2001-09-07

The strengths of the novels have always been the characters, especially our hero, Bosch, who is a complex and very interesting, fully developed character. That being said, I had very high expectations for the Concrete Blonde and I was NOT disappointed! I thought it was the best yet. Bosch and company is in top form, as usual; but there is also a compelling and superbly plotted mystery that needs to be solved.  There are several plausible suspects and Connelly keeps you guessing until the end. One of the minor criticisms I had with the previous novels was that Bosch was too much of a loner; he never had anyone on his side and he didn't have any friends. In this one Bosch has some allies; it isn't \\"Bosch versus the world\\" and that makes for much more of a plausible and compelling story, and Bosch seems fore human. It was a nearly flawless novel of the genre and I consider it to be one of the best that I have ever read.	2001-08-24

I have read several of his books now, and I continue to be surprised at how fresh and original each books is.  This one is a continuation of the witches' series, and it is one of the funniest I have read to date.  Granny, Nanny and Magrat are among the most comical of Pratchett's creations.  The three witches travel to foreign lands to prevent an allegedly &quot;good&quot; fairy Godmother from forcing a \\"happy\\" ending to a \\"story\\" against the wishes of the story's unknowing participants.  <br />Witches Abroad contains a collage of many well-known fairy tales.  The novel is loaded with irony and the story happens to be poignant.  I loved this one and highly recommend it.

It is a fast paced, well-written page-turner with a dramatic and satisfying conclusion.  Smith and Chin are interesting and likeable characters, but possibly a bit underdeveloped.  (But I'll attribute this minor complaint to the fact that I did not read the first Rozan book.)  The Smith/Chin relationship seems a little familiar, and the relationship with the burned out detective also seems overdone, but overall, Rozan creates a believable and original story that blends big-city corruption and inner city violence.  <br />The minor complaints mentioned above notwithstanding, I give this a strong recommendation and I am looking forward to the next installment.	2001-08-03

Feist is a competent writer and he does a good job of creating a world and filling it up with a colorful cast of peoples and creatures.  Although I thought this was very good, I thought the first installment was a little better. I was more interested in Pug, Tomas, Roland, Carline, et al, as they grew up together at the Keep in Crydee.   In trying to keep up with the details of the war between worlds, Feist occasionally lost sight of the superb characters he so intimately brought to us in the first installment.  <br />Feist sets the plot at a nice pace and despite the length of the two volumes they can be read relatively fast. Overall, this was entertaining and a worthwhile addition to the fantasy genre.	2001-07-10

After reading A Catskill Eagle I started to worry that Parker was losing me with his &quot;Spencer as Rambo&quot; style.

There is a lot of police involvement in this one as Spencer agrees to help out our favorite detective, Martin Quirk.  Hawk helps out, which is always a plus, and there is the added suspense of Susan being put in the path of danger as she becomes involved in her role as psychotherapist.  <br />A Crimson Joy is a top notch Spenser novel and I highly recommend it for all fans of the crime novel.  I can't wait to read the next in the Spenser saga!	2001-06-13

McCaig gives us several viewpoints, from slaves and slaveholders to the soldiers fighting the war.  I was reminded of Gone With the Wind, Roots, and Glory at various times during the novel.  As you would expect in a civil war novel, there are plenty of gory battle scenes.<br />It was a very good, though not the most original, telling of the civil war period.  But McCaig makes up for the lack of originality with a strong narrative and some really memorable characters.  You will be left with a good sense of what it was like during the darkest period in American history.   I give this a strong recommendation for those who enjoy historical fiction, and especially those who enjoy civil war novels.	2001-06-05
US	51107353	RHNWSG3D5YJIV	0375701907	635714194	Straight Man: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Should not be missed!	William Henry (a.k.a. Hank) Devereaux, Jr. is a wisecracking middle aged college teacher going through all kinds of crises.  He is the beleaguered chair of his English department in a college that is about to get downsized by at least 20%.  His oldest daughter is having marital problems.  His father, who left him and his mother when he was a young boy, is returning to live with his mother in his old age. He also has fears (fantasies?) that his wife is cheating on him with his friends. On top of it all, he is having a physical problem of a highly private nature.  Seemingly beset from all sides, Hank rarely takes things seriously, even as he knows serious and potentially tragic things are happening.  <br />The novel is told from Hank's point of view.  Hank is a colorful character, and we get a very colorful view of his world and the people around him.  Russo writes this in a way that we get to know Hank more than he knows himself, just as those closest to Hank seem to know him better than he knows himself.  Hank is one of the most memorable characters in recent contemporary literature that I have read about.  Another book or two like this one, and I think Russo will gain the stature of the likes of John Irving and Phillip Roth.  At once comical and serious, this was a great moving novel; I highly recommend it.	2001-04-29

This was a wonderful book that deserves wider attention. It is set in an alternate early America, during the time of the Tecumseh and the Indian Wars.  As much a frontier western as it is a fantasy, this novel will delight fans of both genres.  <br />Card is an excellent writer who weaves his story with moral and religious overtones.  He exposes the best and worst of the frontier Americans, as well as objectively showing the impossible and inevitable conflict with the Native Americans.  Card doesn't ignore his characters.  Alvin, Tecumseh (renamed Ta-Kumsaw) and his brother, the Prophet, are all deep and vividly portrayed characters.  And William Henry Harrison, notorious in history for being the president with the shortest term, is portrayed here as the darkest of men.<br />If you want to read this book, you will have to read the first in the series, The Seventh Son, also a very good novel, but as you read it keep in mind that you have this one to look forward to.  The Red Prophet is a well-written, highly entertaining and original story that ranks among the best fantasy fiction available.	2001-04-17
US	51107353	R9F6NG0TK1WIT	0440222680	557216593	Fade Away (Myron Bolitar)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Very good	Coben writes a skillfully plotted, entertaining hardboiled PI novel that falls just a little bit short of my favorites (Parker's Spenser, Block's Scudder, etc.)  Our hero, Myron Bolitar, is a wisecracking sports agent who literally enters the world of the NBA to track down his team's missing star.  He gets help along the way from an enigmatic tough guy \\"sidekick\\" and a spunky female assistant named Esperanza.  Doesn't sound all that original, does it?  But Coben pulls it off by making his characters interesting and human.  The story is fast paced and has lots of twists and turns as Bolitar tries to find the missing star, tries to solve a related murder, and deal with the problems of his own past.  Very entertaining, and like all great mystery novels, it leaves you wanting more Bolitar.	2001-04-01
US	51107353	RGVIKHIZXQHNF	0886774314	137588323	Downbelow Station (Alliance-Union Universe)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Worthwhile	Written over 20 years ago, this has the timeless quality that all of the great epic sci-fi novels have.  The story revolves around a struggle between old Earth and the outer colonies (called the Union) that no longer depend on Earth for trade and sustenance; there are some obvious parallels to the American Revolution.  Caught in between this galactic struggle is Downbelow Station on a world called Pell, which is trying to remain neutral.  <br />This is a complicated and intriguing story that is for the most part entertaining, but sometimes a little flat. For such a big book, there are some sections that seem sketchy, almost as if this was a trilogy that was condensed into a stand-alone novel.  But for these relatively small problems, the novel was well written and is worthwhile reading for science fiction fans.	2001-03-20
US	51107353	R565PTS3EKTVD	0552134627	390521147	Guards! Guards!	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Highly Recommended!	This is the eighth Discworld novel and the sixth I have read. Why does it seem that they are getting better?  Is it that I simply can't remember how good the previous ones were?  <br />The story is set around the city guard, led by Captain Vimes, who is a composite of many well-known detectives/cops that we are familiar with. He is a cynical, bumbling alcoholic, but goodhearted and ultimately heroic in all his failings as he goes about saving the kingdom from a usurping dragon.  The supporting characters are just as entertaining and fully developed, including the librarian (oook!)  <br />Needless to say, I highly recommend this one.  It was at times hilarious, thought provoking (I'm not kidding), suspenseful (the last half of the book is set at a blistering pace) and overall a brilliant satire. Pratchett gives us a scathing commentary on the human condition while providing us with superb entertainment.	2001-02-14

In this superb novel, the recently dead relatives and the not so recently dead relatives of an orphaned boy and his Aunt come back to \\"haunt\\" them in a way that changes their lives forever.  This was a beautiful and moving novel, told with humor and written in clear stylish prose.  I was immediately swept up in the world created by the author and became totally immersed in the characters and their drama. I consider this a masterpiece and I highly recommend it.	2001-02-08

I have read several Spenser novels chronologically starting with Mortal Stakes.  This was my least favorite so far, but I still give it high grades.  Parker is really stretching credibility in a story that boils down to a fight between two boys over a girl.  It is a really big and complicated fight, and it involves mercenaries, gun manufacturers, CIA, FBI, so on and so on.  But Parker somehow pulled it off.  I can't help but enjoy the dynamic of Spenser, Hawk, Susan, et al.  As with all of Parker's books, the strength lies in his characters. <br />Overall, it was an entertaining but not quite great book; it was just a little too farfetched to get a five star rating.  But if you are a fan of Spenser, you have to read this book.  It is of crucial importance if you are following the relationships and the development of the characters.	2001-01-25
US	51107353	R2LKD5WGTE6UJ6	0553564943	930626996	Magician: Apprentice	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Epic Fantasy Classic	I read The Lord of the Rings many years ago and it is still one of my favorite works of fiction.  Since then I have read many \\"epic fantasy\\" novels and I have learned not to expect much.  There is a lot of junk out there, but there are also a lot of fun and entertaining books.  Magician falls into the latter category.  It will never be considered a literary classic, but in its genre it certainly stands out.  It has the standard ingredients: good elves, bad elves, dwarves, goblins, etc.  There are dragons, magicians and enchanted weapons.  The twist here is that the enemy comes from another dimension.  So, while it isn't the most original work of fiction, there is enough to make it interesting.<br />Feist tells a great story; it is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.  It is light reading, the pages just melt away, but it doesn't insult the intelligence.  For those who like imaginary world fantasy I highly recommend this one.	2001-01-19

I've always known about this book, and I knew it was considered a classic, but somehow I ignored it.  Don't ignore this book! It is a flawlessly written true account of the brutal cold-blooded murder of a family of four in 1959. There are certain chapters of this book that are absolutely mesmerizing.  Perry's confession may be one of the most harrowing accounts I have ever read, fiction or non-fiction.  And what makes it more compelling is that it's true.  In retrospect, I can see the influence this book has had on the mystery and crime genre. It adds credibility to all of the fictional criminals that you read about in your favorite mystery novels. I highly recommend this book.	2001-01-15

This was another immensely entertaining and satisfying novel from Connie Willis.  It was humorous and filled with colorful characters; Cyril the dog is one of the best nonhuman characters in recent literature.   Willis doesn't bog us down with the physics of time travel; she asks us to believe the possibility and proceeds with a charming mystery/romance set in both the future and in Victorian times.  As in her previous novel, The Doomsday Book, the strength of the novel is in her detailed imagining of the past.  The tone is light and it doesn't quite pack the emotional punch of her grim previous novel, however, it is very well written and cleverly plotted.  The last fifty pages will leave your head spinning as you work out the possibilities.  Another memorable novel, I highly recommend it.	2000-12-19

The story is a little familiar, reminiscent of old Dirty Harry films, but this isn't just a novel about plot.  It is about style, Matthew Scudder and New York City.  My favorite flawed hero, Scudder, is a complex character who has several fascinating and oddly compelling relationships with the various types of citizens of New York.  It is also a novel about alcoholism, loneliness and friendship; at one point Scudder reflects that his best friends are a prostitute and a career criminal.  Ironically, it is the prostitute and the criminal who lifts Scudder from the depths; not his law abiding friends.  A moving, reflective and skillfully written novel, it is about as good as crime fiction gets.  Highly recommended.	2000-11-17

Yes, there are some headless bodies that show up on Gordianus' property, and a significant portion of the story centers around this mystery, but this novel is more about the intrigues of ancient Roman politics and family life.  The novel is superb in every way: there are memorable characters, especially Catalina; the plot is suspenseful; it is well written; and you get an entertaining and informative look at ancient Rome at a crucial time in its history.  I highly recommend this for fans of mystery and/or historical fiction.	2000-10-28

It is a story about a \\"virus\\" that infects the galaxy and the quest to retrieve the \\"antidote\\".  But there is so much more to this epic.  There is a deep space setting, and a setting on a primitive world inhabited by packs of sentient, dog like creatures.  Vinge expertly plots the story and brings the two worlds together in grand style.  It is a long book, but it is well paced and suspenseful most of the way.  The characters, both human and alien, are convincing.  An amazing trip through the deepest reaches of the galaxy, I consider this one of the top sci-fi novels of the past decade.  Like all great science fiction, it stretches your imagination to the limit.	2000-10-10

Thankfully, this did not turn out to be the case.  It was an exceptional  first novel, with interesting and fully developed characters.  I  particularly liked the male-female detective duo.  It was a little choppy  at first, and some of the jokes seem forced, but Lehane eventually makes it  work.  It isn't as funny as Parker and the dialogue isn't as sharp, but the  story is superb and the race element adds a compelling dimension.  A very  promising debut and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.  A couple more strong efforts like this and he may crack my top 5 mystery  authors (Block, Burke, Connelly, Parker and Saylor).	2000-08-30

Filled with personal details, the strength of this book lies in the  recounting of Lincoln's most intimate moments.  Read this book and you will  get the full picture of the man behind the legend.  He was truly an  American hero, and I daresay that if you read the book you will come to  love the man.

Very different from its predecessor, this novel has very little warfare or space action.  However, it is just as absorbing and suspenseful and probably the better of the two.

A stylish mystery novel, Hill sustains a high writing level and keeps the story moving with  plenty of twists and turns.  As the story moves along you can't help but  despise the villain more and more.  All of the police are likeable and well  developed characters.  <br />Although it is a bit ponderous at times, the  novel is never boring and you will not be able to put it down until the  surprising ending.

Travis Lee Stanhope, an American soldier fighting for the British in France, eloquently tells the story.  We suffer with him not only as he fights the  war against the Germans, but also as he fights an internal war against the  ghosts that haunt him.  Travis fights loneliness, alcoholism, homophobia  and anti-Semitism.  <br />There are all kinds of nastiness in this novel.  It  is gory and realistic.  Some scenes are as horrifying as you could imagine.   But ultimately, this was one of the most sensitive and moving novels I  have ever read.  Recently I have read some excellent war novels (The Black  Flower, Fields of Fire, among others). This was as good as (if not better  than) any of them.  Highly recommended, do NOT miss this one.	2000-06-10

It was so gloomy I was reminded of New York in the classic sci-fi movie Escape from New York.  Is it really so horrible?  But the characters sparkle,  especially Rostnikov, as they somehow survive and cope amidst the  corruption, crime and depression.  <br />This book is composed of three  interesting and suspenseful crime stories.  Rostnikov's team is split up  into three pairs and each pair is assigned to a case.  All three tales are  compelling and all of the characters, both good and bad, are fully  developed. <br />This was as good as A Cold Red Sunrise, which won an Edgar.   Recommended reading for all mystery fans.	2000-06-01

Beautifully written, this is a novel that without doubt transcends the genre.  It is a great novel and one of the best war novels I have ever read. It is reminiscent of  The Red Badge of Courage in its style, except for the highly gory scenes.  Not for the squeamish, there is one scene in which there are piles of  amputated limbs that reach as high as a house window.  More than anything,  this is a novel about friendship, love and survival in the midst of a  nightmarish tragedy.  Highly recommended!	2000-05-13

A solid, original and interesting work of science fiction, Sundiver has the important elements of good science fiction: a convincing future, a story filled with wonder, and thoughtful ideas about man's ultimate role in  the universe.  But frankly, I was a little disappointed.  The writing level  is low and the characterizations and dialogue are weak.

A suspenseful, character driven mystery novel that grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the satisfying and surprising conclusion.  Bosch, a true maverick hero, is one of my favorite characters  in the genre (and I love his taste in music). <br />Connelly skillfully  overlaps law enforcement with the criminal world.  Some of the so-called  good guys seem just as rotten as the bad guys, and Connelly doesn't make  excuses for anyone.  The only complaint I have with the book is that  everyone seems to be against Bosch, and it gets a little frustrating.  But  it is a very minor complaint and isn't enough to take away from the  five-star rating.  I can't wait to read the rest.	2000-03-22

Hersey shows all that is good and bad about America, while telling a good, tightly plotted story.  There  is a perfect blend of sarcasm and honest characterizations.  Despite the  lighthearted tone the book makes quite an impact and stays with you.  In my  opinion this is a masterpiece of 20th century American literature.	2000-03-13

The fourteenth Cadfael book I have read and it was as enjoyable as the first thirteen. I admit that some of the plots have been predictable, but this is easily overlooked because Peters does such an expert job at bringing the 12th century to life, and Cadfael is such an entertaining character. <br />This particular installment happens to be one of the better mysteries in the series. Like the previous thirteen, it is a well-written and finely crafted story, but there are also some clever surprises. It is a cut above the average Cadfael book, but doesn't quite reach the five star qualities of the first two (Morbid Taste for Bones and One Corpse Too Many) that are true mystery classics.	2000-03-03

When the story begins, Guenevere is already  middle aged, and Britian is on the brink of chaos.  As the story progresses  we learn of the maturing of Guenevere as a person and as a queen.<br />The  novel starts off fast and furious with battles and betrayals.

The seediness of NYC becomes the backdrop for the flawed hero that you have to love. <br />This was  the third Scudder mystery I have read, and they have all been excellent.  There are several fast moving plot lines that are expertly intertwined;  there is quality writing; and the dialogue is sharp and accurate.  But,  like any great work of fiction, the novel goes much deeper.  An  unforgettable novel, I highly recommend it.	2000-02-04

On Celestis, humans have done what they have always done well throughout history: conquer, subjugate and assimilate the conquered without regard for the native culture.  Then comes revolution and unrest.  This is the setting  for an alien - human love story that is like no other.<br />This was a darkly  poetic, thought provoking novel.   Park presents a gloomy picture and there  isn't much here to cheer about.  The relationship between human and alien  is seen from numerous points of view.  But it is the alien's point of view  that is most disturbing and unfortunately most accurate. As the drugs wear  off she begins to thinks of humans (and her \\"lover\\") as dogs.  <br />This is  an important work of science fiction.  But if you are looking for fast  paced sci-fi adventure this isn't for you.  If the characters weren't all  so pathetic I may have given this 5 stars.  Recommended reading for the  serious reader.	1999-12-24

I thought the  ending was a bit cliched; but otherwise I highly recommend this one.	1999-06-07

Suspenseful and funny, it has all you can ask for in a mystery novel.  Elvis is a riot.  My only fault with the book is that the violence, especially at the end, is a bit overdone.  It is a half a  notch below Parker or Block.	1999-02-02
US	51107353	R1UD4HWRG6UPLE	0553576216	168955433	Ferman's Devils	Books	2	1	3	N	N	A mildly amusing but unremarkable satire.	I was disappointed.  I was hoping for a harder hitting futuristic satire; what I got was a lightweight story with mostly uninteresting characters.  Perhaps if you are really into advertising and marketing the novel is  worthwhile.  For the average casual reader I would say skip this one.	1999-01-28

The characters are interesting and there is a witty charm that is sustained throughout the novel. However, it is deliberately predictable which takes away from a  level of drama that could have made this a great novel.	1998-12-31
