The author covers the concept of big and small, but even more importantly makes children understand that just because something (or someone), seems very different than you doesn't necessarily mean you won't have something in common. And, just because something (or someone) is bigger than you doesn't mean they aren't feeling scared, too. I love reading this book to my children.	2003-02-05

She's captured all of those elements once again in a very entertaining way. She combined a study of sociology, a tangled mystery and a riches-to-rags-to-riches theme all into one great read.	2003-02-05

As with all first drafts, it needed some polishing, and some filling in. The author had a great plot, but, not enough details. I wanted to know how she struggled and what all she went  through to succeed in her business, instead we read that she opens her  business on a shoestring and boom, she's rich and owns stores everywhere.  The &quot;urst&quot; element was there, (unrequited lust), but was taken a  little bit too far and began to get a bit tedious. I would have given this  book three stars except that for several chapters the author kept  mentioning &quot;ice tea&quot;, over and over. Now one grammatical error is  understandable, but to keep saying it over and over again really gets on  one's nerves and takes away from the story. Why not serve lemonade or  bourbon, at least she could spell it.	2000-04-22

I don't usually enjoy reading Word Books aloud to my children, but this book is one we've memorized from so many readings. It has a story line as well, and the best part is playing a game my daughter and I made up. After reading each page, I ask her, &quot;Where's the bug?&quot;, because there  is a little bug somewhat hidden on every page. My daughter was very young,  under 2, when we started this game and it really made her think and enjoy  this book so much more.

As with all Curious George stories, I disagree with the generalmoral that this book carries. And that seems to be that all's wellthat ends well, or the end justifies the means.  I disagree with this philosophy, and especially think it a bad philosophy to teach young children, who, due to their inexperience and lack of reference, need stricter boundaries than do adults or even adolescents.  I give This book 2 stars, instead of just one, due to sentimental reasons, I suppose. Curious George was one of the first set of books I remember that had a little more vivid color than the standard red and black library books of my early youth.  END	2000-04-02

The  story itself is a Cinderella type theme, the &quot;fairy god-mother&quot;  is a rather jaded, crafty, old society girl, which is a delightful twist  and  by trying to help truley good girl (the Cinderella), she learns alot  herself.

The author, again, not only told you the story of survival of an incredible person, but also a story based on fact. This book tells what it's like to be a real woman, a woman  of strength and dignity. This book tells what it really must have been like  to be a (Native) American back in those horrid times. I'm ready to plant my  garden and I want to plant in the natural, efficient, grateful way the  natives did, and this book speaks of, and compare it to the  &quot;wapsi&quot; ways I have been taught all my life. To me, had the  natives had a better understanding of Christ,( perhaps by better examples),  they would have lived as close to Eden as any culture has ever achieved.  Too bad greed and alcohol and fear devestated that Eden so thoroughly.  Thank you, James Alexander Thom, for reminding us and refreshing our view  of  who we are, and how we got here by your historic novels and  accountings.

But this one will! A very tangled web, rags to riches, struggle and survival story with a red herring ending. Wish all her books were this  good! Read this book, be amazed,but don't tell anyone how it ends!	2000-03-16

If it hadn't had her name on it, not only would I have not recognized her, but I wouldn't have read past the first page. The lead  characters were unlikable at best.They both had the temperament of three  year olds, were uncontrollably violent, (sorry, I don't find shoving each  other in anger acceptable, much less sexy), and who would have a dead  person lying on top of them and wonder if they are looking sexy? The plot  jumps around and contradicts. It was as if the author,(whoever that was),  got tired of the whole thing and decided to end it suddenly.And, it  couldn't have ended soon enough for me. C'mon Jude, we want you back!  I  hope this isn't the first Deveraux book someone reads, because she is  usually an extraordinary author. Read my favorite, &quot;Wishes&quot;, or  &quot;Knight in shining armor&quot;. Those are classics in the romance  genre.	2000-02-23

Using items common in the pantry of most Americans, you're able to use this book to guide you through making the favorite snacks, desserts, and even some entree's we grew up on. Even has tips on \\"gilding the Lily\\", making those classics just a wee bit better.	2000-02-22
US	50817171	RJ1Z7U75RFPNM	9992679824	380807670	The Prince of Tides	Books	5	2	4	N	N	The movie was nothing......	I read this book shortly after it came out. It is the kind of book that will make you burn dinner, miss appointments and neglect hygiene, you can't put it down. I had the sense all through this book that it was somewhat  autobiographical, There is alot of symbolism, and pure Southern,  particularly Charlestonian, culture that Ms. Streisand completely neglected  in the disappointing film version of this great story. Nick Nolte was  perfect for the character he played, however. Very southern, very  Charleston. This book is graphic in it's violence and tortuously painful in  it's hardest parts, but so real. If you're not Southern, you might not be  able to fully appreciate the subjects he deals with. But, it's one of my  absolute favorite books of fiction, ever.	2000-02-20

If you're looking for a complex plot or deep philosophical discussion,look elsewhere. This is pure entertainment for those days when your brain has been used enough  already! I also found that it inspired me to do my housekeeping, which is a  minor miracle. I hate housecleaning, but reading  how Evangeline  &quot;made-do&quot; with the meager supplies and accomadations she had  while being so isolated with her daughter gave me a new perspective. I'm  looking forward to the rest of this series.	2000-02-20

This was an extremely well written book, and I should know,                      having grown up in the area these stories originated from. Mr.                      Morgan writes in the language of the Carolina Mountain  people.                      A language that soothes the soul, and calls us  home. As we would                      say here in NC to this  author,&quot;You done your Mama proud.&quot;	2000-02-18
US	50817171	RX5Z345JDYQF4	0345338545	92131502	Follow the River	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Amazing	This is one of the best books of fiction I have ever read. If you can stand to get through the massacre scene at the beginning,( which is extremely violent, graphic and involves the murder of a baby),and read  about the journey of this woman, you will be amazed. I cried and prayed for  a woman who was long dead before I was ever born. The sheer strength of  will, and spirit of survival is enough to put those of us living our  comfortable lives to shame. Read this book, then read &quot;Tecumseh;  Panther in the sky&quot; by Thom. Great books, teaching history, sociology,  and geography while entertaining.	2000-02-17
US	50817171	R3RKYCZNEAVJ35	0821753975	574287886	Prince Of Swords	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Good, twice	I rarely ever read a book of fiction twice, even if I loved it the first time. I had picked this up in preparation for a snowstorm, without realizing I had read it a couple of years ago. About three pages into it, I  rememberred having read it, but found it entertaining enough to finish it  again. It was very well written, a very tangled web, and it is hard to  discern exactly how it will turn out. Tough, but not unfeminine, female  characters,  and all the characters were very well defined.  I did dislike  the forceful seduction scenes, however. But, I'm looking forward to reading  more by this author.	2000-02-13

However, if you can use this book as a reference, with an open mind, and  with the sense of reality that there is more than one GOOD way to do  something, then this is an excellent choice.   I liked the way it was lain  out, month by month and also indexed. You can get a basic idea of what's  going on in there, what could happen and also look up what you are  specifically concerned about.    But, remember, this isn't the Holy Bible,  every woman and every pregnancy is different. Just keep an open mind and  diversify your references. Oh, and congratulations!	2000-02-08

But after beginning this book, my opinion of him began to fade. I was ashamed to have people know I was reading it, the language was that filthy. It was funny in places, I'll give  him that. I just wish he, and most other comedians and humorists realized  that it takes more talent to be clean and be funny. Anyone can tell a dirty  joke. I don't recommend having this book anywhere near children, unless you  want to answer alot of uncomfortable questions and have there perception of  you drastically alterred. Sorry, Drew.	2000-02-07

It is unbelievable how this man predicted so much of the technology of our age. More importantly, he will make you think and re-think about behaviors we  take for granted. He, in all his books, will make you question just exactly  what you believe and why you believe it. Strangely, perhaps, he made me a  stronger Christian, though he shook me up and made me ask why I believe the  way I do, I was even more assured, and knew why I was assured after reading  the books of Heinlein. Read him for yourself, it's  hard to describe the  way he affects you.	2000-02-06

It holds your attention, even though you have a basic idea of how things will  turn out, after all it is a love story, but the  descriptions of daily life and customs are well written enough to make the  story interesting. Not high brow intellectual stuff, but  well above soap  opera drivel. I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.	2000-02-06

I made a promise to myself when my son was born that I would read a book of fiction a week.Well, that has been over 12 years ago and I've met or exceeded that. When folks ask me which ones are my favorites, this is  definitely one of them! I could not put it down, I was so mad when I  reached the end because it was the end! I wanted more! Luckily, there is  The Prodigal Daughter. Read this book, you'll love it!	1999-11-25
