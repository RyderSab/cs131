The story this time centers around a painting purchased by the Duke of Dusntable and a troubled romance.  In the beginning, Lord Emsworth is troubled by the news that his sister Connie, a dragon of a woman, is returning to Castle Blandings for a visit.  The troubled Lord Emsworth calls on his brother Gallahad Threepwood, a member of the Pelican club and the Pelican mentioned in the title, to provide him moral support in the face of his sister.  Before going to the castle, Gallahad finds out that his godson is engaged to the neice of the Duke of Dunstable, which his sister Connie has invited to the castle.  However, the engagement goes bad, and Gallahad must think of a way to get his godson into the castle to mend the relationship.  Pure Wodehouse. <br /> <br />This story is a good read, but not the best of the series.  However, if you're a Wodehouse fan, you probably should pick this up.	2005-10-03

Despite being over 100 years old, this novel still packs a punch.  In fact, I found that I like the novel version much better than the movies.  The Martians seem somewhat more terrifying through the eyes of the 18th century, while at the same time seeming more realistic.  For example, in the novel, the Martians are a little careless in the begining, and one of them is killed by a lucky artillary shot.  However in more recent versions, the aliens are even impervious to nuclear attack.  This takes the science of the Martians from advanced to super or almost magical.  The novel does a much better job I think.  H. G. Wells proves that science fiction doesn't have to be ephemeral--it can last despite the advances in science.	2005-09-27

It seems like it was originally written as a blog, and then it was compiled into a book later, so the writing style is very blogish.  In other words, agressive and egocentric.  Also, some people may have issues with Mike's political views.  Mike is a self-proclaimed anarchist, and he'll irritate people on the left and the right, and even in the center at times. <br /> <br />Despite these weak points, I think this book has a lot going for it.  We Americans tend to be very egocentric and blind to our own faults.  Sometimes it takes an outside perspective to see the big picture.  Perhaps Americans would be surprised to see how others see them and their place in the world.  Of course, there are those who would say that they don't care about what others think, but that's just sad.  If you manage to offend everyone and alienate all of your friends, you'll be in a lot of trouble later. <br /> <br />As an American living overseas, I can see a lot of Mike's points, but I also found myself disagreeing with some of his points as well.  But in the end, I found that it was a worthwhile read.  Again, don't expect great prose, and you'll enjoy this quick read.	2005-09-27

The authors attempt to build a theory of cohesion.  Cohesion is the phenomenon which holds a text (a term which also applies to spoken English) together as a whole.  It starts off pretty well with Reference and Substitution as ways of providing cohesion, but when it gets to the section on Clausal Ellipsis, the structure breaks down.  What you learned was verbal ellipsis is also propositional ellipsis which could also be another type of clausal ellipsis.  Getting a headache yet?  Just imagine reading over 300 pages of that.  In the end, the authors don't make it clear what they want you to classify things as, and you also get a sense that this theory of cohesion doesn't really tell you much about the language anyway. <br /> <br />As I mentioned before, the text is packed with jargon and obscure terminology, so it takes forever to get through this text.  Perhaps with a second or third reading it would make more sense, but I don't know many who would put themselves through that voluntarily.  If you've been assigned this text, all I can say is good luck.  If you have some control over the choice of your reading material, avoid this and try something in Discourse or Genre Analysis.  You'll get more out of it and you won't get such a strong headache.	2005-09-07

Unfortunately, some of the Harry Potter magic is gone.  Basically, this story moves along as Dumbledore shows Harry memories from the past in the pensive, other than that, not a whole lot goes on.  Also, J. K. Rowling tries to add a serious romantic element to the series, but from what she shows us in this book, romance is not her forte.  Also, I'd like to add that I didn't like the ending at all.  I won't spoil it here, but it ends on a big downer without much hope. <br /> <br />So should you buy this book?  Well, if you've read all of the books up until now, just admit to yourself that you can't quit until you read that final seventh book.  As a story in itself, book 6 isn't much, but it may add something to the final book, so just think of it as a two-parter.  If you're a fan, go ahead and pick it up, and if not, give it a miss.	2005-08-25

His writing style just pulls you in as you try to figure out the mind of the protagonist, Duanbai, the fifth emperor of the Xie Empire.  The tale starts out with the death of the fourth emperor and the unexpected appointment of his fifth son, Duanbai, as the emperor.  Duanbai is only 14 years old, and is completely unprepared for the job.  While he wastes his time with his pursuits, the real government is his overbearing grandmother who rules with an iron fist.  On commiting his first act of cruelty, he feels regret, but his grandmother tells him that he would do the same, so he goes down the road to being a cruel and thoughtless ruler.  His frustration at his powerlessness and his complete inability to rule leads him to strike out at those around him.  This tendency is made worse by his poor mental health.  As his empire crumbles around him, though, he begins to see some things which offer him some comfort and perhaps a path to a better life. <br /> <br />It may be difficult to imagine the cruelty which the protagonist enjoys, and some may be put off by it.  Some may even claim that such cruelty is unimaginable, but I don't think that is true.  The world around us is surrounded with cruelty which is just as bad as anything this emperor does.  The only difference is that we have come to accept that cutting out prisoners' tongues is unacceptable, while we rationalize the cruelties of our modern age.  In reading this book, I hope that you step back from the fictional world of Duanbai's empire, and take a look at our own world.  If you do that, reading this book can become a powerful experience.	2005-08-14

Among the things provided here, are a hundred adventure ideas, descriptions, maps and adventure ideas of dozens common locations such as cantinas and so forth, descriptions of several environmental items, such as computer ports and escape pods, planet generators, and GM character generators.  The list goes on.  This book comes in really handy when you need to whip up a quick adventure, location, or character.  It takes some of the backbreaking work out of planning a campaign.  Also, I would recommend this for beginning gamemasters.  The advice here will really help beginners get into the swing of things.  However, if you're an experienced gamemaster, the advice section will probably be common knowledge for you, so you'd only be able to use this for the locations and generators. <br /> <br />The downside of this book is the art.  A lot of the artwork is done in a cartoony style in which the Star Wars world is mixed with the modern world.  You end up with ridiculous art like a Star Wars alien wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers.  They could have done a much better job with the art. <br /> <br />If you're a beginning gamemaster, be sure to pick this up.  If you're an experienced gamemaster, you could probably skip this one.	2005-08-06

In this book, he chronicles the adventures of a German professor, his nephew, and an Icelandic guide into the depths of the earth.  When I read it, it was very different from what I expected.  Having been exposed to various film and television versions of this story, I imagined some sort of drilling machine was involved.  Also, I had thought that there was some interaction with primitive tribes in the underground realm. <br /> <br />On reading this book, you'll discover a very different story.  The professor buys and old book, and finds an ancient manuscript written by a famous alchemist in which the alchemist claims to have journeyed to the center of the Earth.  The professor inspired by this claim rushes to Iceland to retrace the alchemist's footsteps.  He drags his reluctant nephew along with him, and hires a guide in Iceland.  These three men proceed to walk into the crater of a volcano, and they follow the empty lava tubes into the depths of the Earth.  This is more of a survival story than anything else.  They face shortages of food, water, light, and more.  Verne really knows how to keep a story moving.  For adventure fans, this is a great book to read!	2005-08-06

I bought this for my research on the role of World Englishes in the TESOL classroom.  From my perspective, there were a few problems with this text.  First of all, there is no overall theme, so the individual articles didn't form a complete whole.  They seemed more like a grab-bag of ideas rather than a comprehensive review of the field.  Also, there are a lot of articles which feature fairly detailed research without tying into a larger theme.  For example, there is an article on the pronunciation of one vowel group in Australian English.  This is great if you're writing a paper on Australian pronunciation, but it doesn't really tie into the theme of World English, so you'll probably skip it.  There are quite a few articles like this.  In short, this book suffers from poor editing. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I was able to find some useful articles.  The sections on South Asia and Africa were particularly useful for me.  In the end, though, I have to say that this book shouldn't be your first choice.  I recommend \\"The Other Tongue\\" by Kachru or \\"English as a Global Language\\" by Crystal instead.  If you have these already, and you would like to get another source, then this might be one to pick up.	2005-08-04

First of all, I have to say that I'm really pleased with the full-color format.  There's a nice mix of scenes from the movie and original artwork.  As for the system, it is based on the D20 system, and it is quite easy to learn, especially if you are familiar with other D20 systems.  Another great plus is that this book is a complete package.  In other words you can start playing with just this book.  I was really pleased with that because a lot of systems will make you buy a player's book for character creation and another for gamemastering.  Of course there are lots of other books that will help you add detail to your campaigns, but if you're short on cash, don't worry.  This one will be enough to get you started.  Check it out, and make the world of Star Wars come alive!	2005-08-04

I would definitely recommend buying this as your second book after the core rulebook.  Basically, it's just pack from front to back with a few hundred alien species.  All stats are given, so every alien type is available for player or GM characters.  Some have complained that there are no creatures in this book, but the Star Wars series has never been about dungeon crawling.  If you need creatures, the famous ones are in the core book, and if you want new ones, there's a good creature creation section there too.  This book, on the other hand, gets to the meat of Star Wars encounters--facing down aliens of all races and types.  You'll definitely want to pick this up to populate your campaigns.  Before long, you'll be able to recreate your very own alien cantina.  Perhaps my only complaint is that the artwork was done by several artists, and some of the artwork isn't as good as it could be.  Hopefully in a future edition, some of the sketchy artwork will be replaced.	2005-08-04

In particular, he goes into detail about the use of English loanwords in Japanese for advertising, packaging, pop songs, and so forth.  According to Stanlaw, these are not really loanwords, but English inspired creations.  In other words, Japanese are using English for their own purposes in ways which they can appreciate rather than copying the usage of native speakers.  It's a very interesting theory.  The only reason for giving this four stars instead of five is that Stanlaw fails to make a distinction between English terms that are standard in Japanese and faddish terms, so quite a few of the examples that he provides are out of date and not used anymore.  It would have been nice to make this distinction, and to elaborate on the processes behind both forms of usage.  Other than that complaint, the ideas he presents in this book are very fascinating.  I would recommend this to those who are thinking of teaching in Japan, or those who are studying Japanese overseas.  You'll gain some insight into the Japanese use of language.	2005-07-25

When Deng opened up China for business, the author, Tim Clissold, was one of the first into China with western funds to invest.  However, the dream of endless profits turned into a nightmare.  In this book, you'll face conflict after failure as China is dragged into capitalism.  The experiences in this book may serve as a warning for those who are doing business in China.  In the end though, it seems that many of these problems could have been avoided by a little more research and cultural sensitivity.  Also, in being first in China, Clissold came face to face with a clash of systems.  Westerners assumed that they could do business as usual without concern for the loose business practices of a formerly communist China.  They run into thousands of unexpected problems.  Clissold tries to put a positive spin on it in the end, but after reading the book, you'll wonder where he gets his optimism from.  Overall, it's a quick and interesting read on the opening of China.  If you're doing or thinking of doing business in China, check it out.	2005-07-22

Kachru has collected some of the best articles on the changes that have taken place in the English language.  As English is adopted by more and more people in countries where it isn't a native language, it is changed and molded.  An interesting point which is brought up is that when native speakers use deviant language, it is termed as dialect, creativity, or a slip, but when non-natives use the language, it is called an error.  In this book, it is argued that English belongs to all those that use it.  In other words, to use a language means to have mastery over it, so it can be used as the owner pleases.  To provide further support for non-native varieties, many authors say that non-native Englishes are not necessarily for use with natives, but with other non-natives. <br /> <br />A lot of the points brought up in this book are very interesting.  I recommend it for all who are studying Sociolinguistics and for those who are interested in English's role in the world and its possible future.	2005-07-22

If it doesn't come in a can, or with a toy, we don't eat it.  What we are doing is poisoning ourselves. These chemically processed frankenfoods damage our bodies, not to mention the other goodies such as sodium and saturated fat.  In this companion book to his documentary \\"Super Size Me\\", Spurlock points out some of the dangers of a fast food lifestyle.  The predatory marketing practices of fast food companies, hook children into the habit of eating their greasy, disgusting food.  It seems we Americans have lost all touch with food as culture.  We neglect flavor and skill and instead pour our dollars into the chain restaurants in order to get a meal microwaved by a teenager.  That's not cooking and that's not food.  It's time that we wake up and realize that we haven't eaten real food in a while, and reclaim our food culture before it disappears. <br /> <br />Particularly disturbing is what we are doing to children in the school cafeteria.  Children are given loads of junk food and teaching them a lifetime of bad eating habits.  I remember when I was in high school, we basically had a choice between cheeseburgers or pizza.  Eating that kind of junk everyday as a child can hardly be called healthy.  So it's no wonder that we are experiencing a health crisis now.  Sure everyone expects fast food to be unhealthy, but we deserve more from the schools.	2005-07-16

In this volume, it gives you the basics of character creation and gameplay from the player's point of view.  It's a pretty simple and flexible gameplay system.  However, there are a few complaints about this book.  First of all, I feel that it wasn't organized very well.  There isn't a checklist for character creation (I had to get that from another GM), so at first it's a little confusing.  You have to jump around to different chapters to get all the information you need on character creation.  Even just adding a checklist would have helped a lot.  A second complaint is that a lot of skills, especially racial skills and abilities, are not listed on the character sheet, so again, you'll have to use resourses created by other GMs or make your own. <br /> <br />Even though this book has weak points, they can be overcome with resources available on the internet.  Just be warned, this book only presents the game from the standpoint of the player.  While the book claims that the  game is playable with only this book, it's very difficult because there are no adventure seeds, or even many races or creatures to play with.  If you're planning on running a game, you'll definitely need to pick up the Narrator's Book as well.	2005-07-08

According to Crystal, non-native speakers of English outnumber native speakers of English, so it could be said that English has become global.  Add to this the fact that English has become the de facto language of business, science, technology, and diplomacy, and it becomes apparent that English belongs to the world.  Crystal argues that English will become more influenced by non-native speakers in the future, so we will have to rethink the idea of the \\"native speaker\\".  As a world language, English doesn't belong to the native speakers in countries such as England and America, but to all who speak it.  To speak a language gives you the right to use it as you will.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book on the spread of world English.  I really recommend it.	2005-07-04

Wardhaugh helps the reader to understand that English works the way we use it, and that the grammarian's rules are nothing to be concerned with.  It is pointed out that people have been saying that English has been falling apart for over 400 years!  However as we can see, English is still alive and kicking.

Predictably, Rall goes after the Republicans for their hate filled rhetoric and their disregard for future generations of Americans.  The Republican party is cashing in now, but future generations will have to pay off the mounting debt (I thought conservatives were supposed to be fiscally responsible types).  What may be even worse, the Republicans are alienating people and nations all over the world.  Sure, we're the superpower now, but nothing lasts forever.  Do you want other nations to give us a helping hand or kick us when we're down?  That depends on how we treat other nations now, while we have power.  Pre-emptively invading countries doesn't win any brownie points. <br /> <br />The Democrats get criticized for being too moderate and too nice.  Instead of using the same dirty tricks and viscious political rhetoric that the Republicans use, the Democratic Party just sits back and takes the blows.  This isn't good for the image of the party.  Also, Rall believes that the Democratic Party is too disorganized.  There is no central message for liberals everywhere.  There are only small groups who only care about their own issues.  If the Democrats hope to come back to power, they're going to have to get their act together.  This book is an interesting read for those who consider themselves free thinkers.	2005-06-05

First of all, the writing style skips around.  This book wants to be a serious work of nonfiction, but the authors keep drifting in and out of a diary style of writing, as if we cared how long the ride from Marsailles to Nice is.  What's worse, they tend to start every third sentence with \\"we\\", so after a while the writing style starts to irritate the reader. <br /> <br />The writing style is not the only problem.  The content of this book is laughable.  The authors make numerous claims without support or evidence.  In fact, most of the theories in this book are based on speculation.  To give an example, they often start a line of argument with the phrase \\"it could be imagined\\" or it is entirely possible\\", and then present one of their theories.  A few sentences later, they then take the previous speculation as pure fact and then build their arguments on that.  It is nothing but a house of cards.  Also, it should be noted that the authors are self-proclaimed paranormal investigators--hardly a source of serious knowledge.  Any educated person would laugh or moan on reading the theories presented in this book and the so-called evidence they bring to the table to prove them.  Save your money and buy another book.  Any other book.  It couldn't be worse than this.	2005-05-22

What this book teaches you is that there are many ways to teach grammar.  The three main methods outlined are teaching grammar as a product, as a process, and as a skill.  These three ways of teaching have different advantages and disadvantages.  Through examining the examples in this book, you will be able to take advatage of these different methods of grammar instruction, and learn to judge which methods are appropriate for which situations.  For teachers who are using a communicative approach, but are disappointed with the results of purely communicative method, the approach of teaching grammar as a skill will provide the missing element that is needed in the lesson to improve accuracy.  This book belongs in every language teacher's library.	2005-05-22

Basically, it covers the history of Second Language Acquisition from the beginning of modern linguistics up to the publication date.  If you are studying to become a foreign language teacher or a teacher of English to speakers of other languages, this will prove to be an invaluable resource.  You can find a wide range of studies covered in this book.  If you find something that you're interested in, you can use this to find other studies that may be useful.  If you're studying the teaching of languages, you should pick this up.	2005-04-17

Basically, you should look for well-established companies with a good track record of dividend increases, invest, and wait 30 years.  If you have less than 25 years until retirement, this stategy might not work so well for you because the real wealth development tends to kick in at around the 25 year mark and shoots up from there.  If you have less time than that, then you'll only see a modest return on your investments. <br /> <br />The author provides her pick of top performers historically.  Of course this doesn't mean that these will continue to perform in the future.  The only weak point of this book is that it is based on data from the tech bubble era of the late ninties.  If you plan on taking the authors recommendations, be sure to do your homework and check up on the companies to see how they have weathered the years since the burst of the tech bubble.  I would say about 75 percent of the recommendations are still good, while a few such as AIG may not be so smart right now.  Just be sure to do your homework.  It might be time for the author to give us an updated version of this book.	2005-04-17

It gives officers an idea of how to manage and develop the soldiers under them.  Particularly it gives good advice on how to recognize and deal with certain types of soldiers based on a skill, will, and teamwork scale.  To tell the truth, I'm not in the army, but I bought this book to gain some insight into the army's way of managing and developing soldiers.  I believe that if you are a businessperson or a teacher, you can learn a lot about how to treat different employees or students.  Each person has individual needs that need to be handled in different ways, and I think this is something that this book does a good job of introducing.  If you're in the army, you definitely need this, and if you're not, you can still gain a lot of knowledge by reading this.	2005-04-17

It begins by going over the basics of grammar and then eventually builds up to more complex constructions.  Towards the end of the book, there is a short section on style.  This gives beginning writers some tips on how to make their writing a little more professional.  Finally, there is a useful section on words that are easily mistaken for each other.  I found that section to be very useful even for advanced students.  Basically this is a book for beginning writers.  It would be a good reference for high schools students, college freshmen who haven't had much experience in writing, and students who are studying English as a second or foreign language.  If you have lots of writing experience, you won't find anything new here.  Give it as a gift to a high school student and their writing skills will improve if they read it.	2005-04-13

First of all, the main characters of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" don't appear until the end of the book.  In addition, when the characters finally do appear, its seems as if they had undergone a personality change.  Speaking of personality, I didn't feel that the characters were well developed.  In fact you never really care for the main character of this book, especially after you learn of his urges to kick cats.  Whether he finds his princess or gets turned into a toad, it's all fine as far as the reader goes because the reader never gets a chance to feel any sympathy for the character. <br /> <br />As far as the action goes, it never develops into a coherent story.  It just seems like an endless stream of minor incidents thrown together.  When you finally get to the end, you'll groan at the simple trick used to resolve the final confrontation with the villian.  Not even an elementary school student would fall for it, but it works in this story. <br /> <br />In the end, my recommendation is to pass on this book.  If you haven't read \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\", I recommend reading that instead.  If you have, don't get this book.  It doesn't add anything to \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\".  It shouldn't be labeled as a sequel.	2005-04-13

Books	4	5	7	N	N	Some good ideas	First of all, you have to realize that this is not a business book, but more of a self-help or inspirational type of book.  Kiyosaki doesn't give the reader any business advise or investing tips here.  Basically, he's trying to help people readjust their thinking.  In this consumerist society, people often think that having things makes them rich.  Having a big car or a big house will prove to the world their wealth.  However, in doing this, they drive themselves into debt.  Kiyosaki's basic message is that to gain wealth, one must buy assets rather than liabilities.  This seems like a very simple idea, but many people have misconceptions about what an asset is and what a liability is.  For example, many people consider their homes as an asset, but in reality it is a liability.  By helping readers readjust their definintion of these terms, Kiyosaki helps them on the way out of debt. <br /> <br />This book is a fast and interesting read.  The writing style is very casual, but on the other hand, sometimes seems a little repetitive.  Readers who are thinking of getting out of debt or who are thinking about investing for the first time will find this book very interesting.  People who are already investors, however, will find this to be a little simplistic since it probably covers things they already know and perhaps paints an overly simplistic view of investing.  If you're such an investor, give this a pass.  If you're not, give it a try.	2005-03-28

It was written with the language teacher in mind.  Many of the other books on the subject are focused on the researcher rather than the teacher, so this book fills a gap in the literature.  The explanations of the major theories are carried out without frequent use of jargon, so it's easy for the beginner to get a handle on SLA theory.  I even recommend this for students who are studying SLA in graduate school.  This will provide an excellent introduction that could be read before reading more difficult texts.  After readinging \\"How Languages Are Learned\\", you'll understand more in depth discussions about the theories covered.  A must for all practicing language teachers.	2005-03-28

The key word in the title is \\"research\\".  This book prepares graduate students who are going to do SLA reasearch in the course of their studies.  It provides an excellent introduction to research by first presenting the different styles of reseach used in the field as well as research methods.  The rest of the book consists of the major studies that have been conducted up until the publication of the book.  A graduate student can use this as a resource book for their research.  The methods of each study are well described.  Also, students will be able to see what kind of research has already been conducted, so they can check whether the problem they want to research has already been done.  Also, some new questions have arisen from these studies which would make excellent research projects. <br /> <br />I assume that the previous reviewers were not interested in research, but in application.  If that is the case then they bought the wrong book.  For an introductory text to SLA research, I recommend Lightbrown and Spada's \\"How Languages are Learned\\".  That book is designed for practicing educators, and it gives good explanations of the research without using much jargon.  Please be sure to choose the book that suits your purpose.  In other words, the previous negative reviews are more due to the reviewers' poor choice of material rather than any defect  in the material itself.	2005-03-28

The Input Hypothesis attempts to account for the processes in which languages are learned.  According to Krashen, the only way in which learners can acquire language is through comprehensible input which is slightly above the learners level.  One surprising point he makes is that formal learning never leads to acqusition.  The primary method of getting comprehensible input is through listening or reading.  In other words, it is not so important for learners to practice speaking to acquire language. <br /> <br />While some of Krashen's claims are interesting, in the end his hypothesis doesn't hold water.  Several of his terms aren't well defined and his theories prove impossible to experiment with.  The studies which he claims support his hypothesis either don't really support it or only support it indirectly.  A final complaint is that some of the assumptions he makes rests on faulty concepts.  For example, he misapplies the concept of Chomsky's Language Acquisition Device (LAD). <br /> <br />In the end, the input hypothesis proves to be less than promised.  However, students of applied linguistics may find this book interesting as it illuminates some of the assumptions that we take for granted.  In bringing these assumptions into question, this book provides something of benefit to the student of applied linguistics.	2005-03-06

This epic could be considered the Shakespeare of the Chinese language.  It depicts the decay and collapse of the Han dynasty.  In the process of this decay, the nation is split into three kingdoms which stuggle for supremacy.  In the process of this struggle, we find tales of friendship, heroism, betrayal, and tragedy.  This novel has thousands of characters, but perhaps the main character is Kongming, the military strategist of one of the kingdoms.  It's a pure pleasure to read his elegantly executed strategies.<br /><br />This translation has a modern feel, so it was easier to read than other translations that I have read.  Robert Moss does a good job of making the story flow.  However, as some other reviewers have said, it doesn't have a poetic feel.  While the story has been translated, it is always difficult to translate literature into other languages.  Having said that, I think this is an excellent translation for those who want an easy read or those who are reading Three Kingdoms for the first time.  Also I strongly recommend an unabridged version, such as this one.  If you read an abridged version, the story won't seem well developed.  The full text is necessary.  I especially recommend this novel for those who are studying politics, military science, or business.  You'll learn lots of strategies for living life.	2005-03-06

It's a beautiful companion to the film.  It's filled with beautiful full-color art from the production of The Incredibles.  This art is strongly influenced by 60's era design principles.  There is a smooth simplicity to the designs.  Also, the use of color is a joy to see.  For those who are looking for art from the process of animation, you might be disappointed, because there is none.  You wouldn't want to look at process art for computer animation anyway.  You'd just see a bunch of cubes and spheres on a computer screen.  This book is for those who relish the dream that occurs in the formation of the story and in the development of character and scene designs.  To see this pre-production art is an inspiration, and gives insight into what might have been, and how it had developed in the early stages of production.  As for text, there isn't much, and a little more would be better.  Hopefully we'll get more in depth info on the bonus disk of The Incredibles DVD.  In the meantime, all Incredibles fans should pick up this beauty.	2005-02-09

Dee Brown tells this story from the Native Americans' point of view.  He details how Americans used a series of treaties to swindle the natives out of their land.  Time and time again, these treaties were broken.  Land was continually stolen from the natives, and when they tried to stand up for their rights as outlined in the treaties, then the U.S. army was there to murder and torture the natives until they could no longer resist.  This book will prove to be an eye-opener.  As an American, I was spoon-fed the theory of Manifest Destiny in American high school.

The great symbolic prose of Moby Dick is not to be seen here, but it is interesting to get a sense of the development of Melville's writing.  This book is a semi-fictional account of Melville's experiences in the South Seas.  While his own visit was a brief one, the hero of this book ends up in the Typee Valley for four months.  Melville used numerous current accounts in order to flesh out this story.  A strong point of this Riverside edition is that it also includes several of these sources, so that the reader can get a sense of what else was available on South Island life at the time.  Most of these contemporary sources are imperialistic or surprisingly inaccurate.  This is a good read for those who are interested in the development of cross-cultural relations between Westerners and the natives of the South Seas.  Not surprisingly, Westerners come out in a bad light.  It will make you question what the word 'civilization' means.	2004-12-03

The character at the center of this tale is Dr. Katsumi, a scientist who sets out to created an AI computer capable of predicting the future, in imitation of a successful Soviet model.  As he get closer to his objective, the government begins putting up obstacles to slow his progress.  He is no longer allowed to test political questions on his machine, but when he tries to develop questions that will be acceptable to the committe overseeing his research, it turns out that everything is connected to politics.  Finally he decides to reduce the scale of his research.  He'll focus on a single human instead.  He goes out with his assistant to choose a suitable subject.  Later, they are surprised to learn that the subject they chose has been murdered.  This murder pulls Dr. Katsumi unwillingly into a conspiracy that involves genetic engineer on a massive scale. <br /> <br />This novel is surprisingly fresh for a novel that was written in 1958.  The topics covered--AI computers, genetic engineering, and global warming are all very current.  The story spirals to a tense conclusion, so the reader is pulled in.  The story also has a strong psychological edge.  It explores the difference between what a person wants to do and what a person has to do.  Also, it brings up a lot a questions about the nature of the future.  Can people in the present judge the future?  Abe argues that the future cannot be judged.  In Abe's words, who could say whether the people from the past would consider our present a heaven or a hell.  Only the present can judge the past, not vice versa. <br /> <br />For those who aren't sure where this fits into science fiction, I think I could recommend this to fans of Phillip Dick.  It has a similar dark undertone with a strong psychological basis.	2004-10-06

Books	5	11	12	N	Y	Super Thief	Most English speakers are unfamiliar with Arsene Lupin.  He is one of France's most famous fictional characters--a gentleman master thief.  He's the sort of anti-hero who uses his brains and his carm to escape from any situation the police may put him in.  In this novel, the police have failed to capture Lupin again, so one of the victims calls on the famous English detective Herlock Sholmes (obviously Sherlock Holmes).  The Holmes of this novel is a little different than the Holmes of Conan Doyle.  This Holmes is a little more rigid and cold-hearted than Doyle's Holmes.  He works like a machine and is always hot on Lupin's tracks.  The world's greatest detective verses the world's greatest thief--who will win? <br /> <br />This novel seems to use an old translation.  Some of the phrases are a little old-fashioned, and it seems that the translation was perhaps a bit too tight.  If they retranslated this and used a more modern writing style, it would really improve this book.  However, this is the only translation available that I know of.  Despite this, I still give this book five stars because once you start reading this book, you forget about the structural problems.  You just want to find out who will win.	2004-10-06

Of course there are some superficial physical differences, but if we look closely at the genetic record, there is no evidence of any great differences, and certainly not any differences great enough to divide humanity into races.  One of the discoveries on which he bases his claim is that of the scientific Eve, a woman from which all living humans have descended, which makes us all related.  He goes on to present the fact that through the continual mixing of ethnic groups throughout history, it is likely that we are all related even more closely than we think.  For example, almost all African-Americans have European ancestors, and many white Americans have African ancestors. <br /> <br />With these scientific truths coming to the fore, one hopes for an end to racism in the world.  Unfortunately, racism isn't based on rational thought, but on irrational culture.  Only through education can we eliminate it.  I strongly recommend this book.  If you're teaching any kind of multicultural studies class, you should definitely use this book as one of your sources.	2004-09-20

New York detective Elijah Baley is famous all of the galaxy after having solved the crime on Solaria covered in the previous novel.  It's no surprise then when he is called on when a serious crime comes up on the planet of Aurora, which is the foremost of the Spacer worlds.  The stakes are much higher this time.  Ther person who is accused of the crime is the leading supporter for Earth on the Spacer worlds.  If he is convicted, then Earth's hopes to settle new planets will be crushed, and the Spacer plan of using humanoid robots instead of humans to settle new worlds will go into effect.  Baley is reunited with his robot partner Daneel Olivaw.  On his home planet, Daneel acts a little more robotic than in previous novels. <br /> <br />I felt that this novel was a great read.  I couldn't stop turning the pages.  Asimov is a master at telling stories.  I also liked how he dropped references to \\"I, Robot\\" and the Foundation series in this novel.  I recommend that science fiction fans read the entire robot series and pay tribute to one of the great masters of the genre.	2004-09-20

It is arranged like a FAQ, in a question-and-answer format.  The beauty of this book is it's simplicity and it's objectivity.  Hedges doesn't try to convince anyone to join the military nor does he protest against the military.  He just provides facts, and the readers can chose to use the facts as they please.  For example, will you rush to join the army infantry after finding out that you have a 1 in 5 chance of getting seriously injured if you go into combat?  He also goes into psychological problems that soldiers may develop such as Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  You'll also find out what will happen to you if you are wounded or killed.  Some people may say that this information will just scare off recruits, but don't you think we should tell the men and women who defend our country the truth?  Why should we lie to those we claim to honor?  If you know someone who is thinking of enlisting, buy them a copy of this book before they do so that they will have more than a recruiter's promises to base their decision upon.	2004-09-20

In this book, he outlines the dangers of the rampant outsourcing that American corporations are doing.  By exporting white collar jobs to countries such as India and China, these corporations are undermining American society.  In fact, it's a betrayal of the American worker.  When manufacturing jobs went overseas, corporate America promised their workers that they would have more opportunities to get higher paying white collar jobs.  Well, now those white collar jobs are disappearing, and there aren't any other jobs to turn to other than low paying jobs such as waiter, janitor, and sales clerk at Walmart.  If the American worker is forced to compete with the low wages of third world nations, the standard of living in America will be pushed closer to a third world level due to this competition.  Only the corporate elite will prosper in this new world order of wage slavery.  These corpoate elites don't pay into the tax base, and neither to their foreign workers.  With the declining tax base, the American government goes further into debt.  All it would take is for a country like Saudi Arabia to dump it's reserves in dollars to destroy the American economy.  It's a very precarious situation.  This book does a good job of presenting this issue.  The reason I give this book four stars instead of five is that it is a little short.  It's doesn't give enough case studies to illustrate it's points, and even though it's short, it tends to repeat itself sometimes.  However, I do believe this is a good introduction to the issue.  Check it out.	2004-09-06

They are written from a scientist's point of view.  The emphasis is on creating theories, and the proces in which theories are developed.  This is hard science fiction, so action fans may be disappointed because there isn't much action until the end of the third novel.  The first and second novels are resolved by discovering a truth unrealized before. <br /> <br />The first novel begins with the discovery of a human corpse on the moon which at first doesn't seem so unusual because there are lots of humans on the moon.  But the odd points start adding up.  First, no one is missing on the moon.  Second, the suit doesn't match any of those used by the governments of Earth.  On opening the suit, they find the body has been mummified, and when they date it, they discover that the body is 50,000 years old!  Everything that humans had believed about their origin is put into doubt.  Will they be able to unravel the mystery of this early visitor to the moon?	2004-09-06

There are two important things that this book teaches.  First of all, it helps new writers with their approach to writing.  There are a lot of probing questions which the writer can use to evaluate their story, characters, and dialog themselves.  These reminders help to keep the beginning writer on track. <br /> <br />The second point that this book teaches well is formatting.  It teaches the beginning writer the best way to format a spec script.  Also it helps the reader to tell the difference between a spec script and a shooting script.  A beginning writer needs to write a spec script, so there is no need to worry about camera angles and so forth.  That's the director's job.  As a writer, your job is to tell a story, and that's what a spec script is all about. <br /> <br />There is one weak point.  This book doesn't do a good job with the section on selling the script, but I don't think that it's such a bid problem.  Just consider this a guide for writing and the section on selling as an add-on.  The writing section alone is worth the price of this book.	2004-08-18

Unfortunately, this is a big mess.  It tries to cover too much ground, and it jumps from one thread to the other without warning.  For example, one of the threads is about the zanzibar chest mentioned in the title, but he rarely touches on it.  It covers just a dozen pages or so.  Why he chose it as the title, I can't figure out.  He tries to tell the story of a young man growing up in Africa, about his father's generation of colonialists, about his seperation from his father, about his drug and sex binges, about his work as a journalist in Africa, and about the drug and sex binges of his friends and co-workers.  He jumps from one storyline to the next without rhyme or reason.  The only storyline worth following is the one in which he presents his work as a journalist.  All of the others could be cut out, and it would make this a better book.  As for those who would like to get a little insight and learn something about Africa, you'll be disappointed with this book as I was.  It's not about Africa, it's about Hartley.  If you're not interested in Hartley, then this book will bore you to death.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like was his attitude toward Africa.  He puts on a great show about his love of Africa , but in the very next breath his cynicism betrays his true feelings.  Also, he displays a terrible attitude toward women.  In one section, he gives us a sad story about African prostitutes, and how they are living a hopeless life, and then he turns around and says that he really enjoyed their company.  He goes on to detail how Africa is a prostitution paradise for foreign journalists in Africa.  Really, if you're interest in helping Africa, you shouldn't be part of the problem, and act as a cheerleader for the exploitation of women.  And in a salute to bad taste, a few pages later he tells how he met the love of his life.  That just left a bad taste in my mouth.  I recommend that you avoid this book and find another if you're interested in Africa.ecommend that you avoid this book and find another if you're interested in Africa.	2004-08-10

Daneel Olivaw in this second book of the Robot Series.  This time Baley is summoned to solve a case on the distant planet of Solaria.  Baley wishes to refuse, but his reputatition for solving crimes involving Spacers leaves him as the only choice.  On arriving on Solaria, he is glad to see his robotic partner from the planet Aurora, R. Daneel Olivaw, waiting there for him.  It seems that many planets have a stake in solving this crime on the usually crimeless world of Solaria.  Baley and Daneel discover a strange society in which humans shun personal contact and prefer to view each other through a sort of holographic transmission system.  The problem with this murder case is that only one person could have committed the murder, but it is impossible that she could have committed it.  Baley has to unravel the mystery of how a man was murdered on a planet where it is impossible. <br /> <br />Asimov has a light style that is easy to read and which pulls the reader into the story.  It's difficult to put down.  One word for those who have read the first novel, The Caves of Steel.  If you're a bid fan of Daneel, be aware that he plays a smaller role in this second novel.  Baley is the star here.	2004-08-09

For those who are looking for more in depth coverage, this obituaries style of writing may leave you looking for something else.  If you cut out the phone numbers, lists of business hours, and transportation information, then the page count would be cut in half.

Also she has worked in the Harvard Writing Lab, so she has a great deal of experience with writers of dissertations.  This experience really shines in this book.  She approached the problem of writing from a psychological angle.  She covers some common problems faced by graduate students and gives practical advice for overcoming these obstacles.  The key to writing is to write while you are thinking, or even before.  If you attempt to write after thinking, you will block out a lot of ideas before they have a chance to mature.  The important thing is to get your thoughts out onto paper, then after you collect lots of ideas, go back over what you wrote and pick out the pearls.  If you edit yourself while you're writing, you tend to be overly critical and the negativity blocks the flow of the writing process.  Actually, I think this book would be great not only for dissertation writers, but for writers of any kind.  If you're facing a wall in your writing, this book could help you out a lot.	2004-08-01

In this adventure, French naturalist Pierre Aronnax is taken aboard the Nautilus, a secret high-technology submarine capable of high speeds.  Aronnax meets the enigmatic Captain Nemo, a renegade against society with a strong desire for revenge against the enemy that drove him under the sea.  This novel is one of the first examples of modern science fiction.  The world of science fiction owes Jules Verne a great debt.<br /><br />This edition is particularly valuable.  Most people aren't aware that the standard English translation is filled with lots of translation errors which botch the science of Verne's masterpiece.  Also, the standard version cuts about 25% of the original French novel.  This translation fixes the errors, and returns 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea's scientific accuracy (for that time).  Also, the cut parts have been restored, so we can now enjoy reading a complete version of Verne's novel.<br /><br />If you love classic books, and you're interested in reading about one of the greatest characters in science fiction, you have to read this.

Basically this is two books rolled into one, so you really get your money's worth.  The first half mainly deals with Wilson's career in the foreign service.  The second half goes into the recent struggles he has had with the Bush admininstration.  In particular, the administration's penchant for lying and the criminal act of revealing the identity of his CIA agent wife.  Both sections are very compelling to read.<br />The section dealing with his career takes us on a whirlwind tour of life in the foreign service in Africa.  He vividly show us the low and the high points of his career--from stuffing bodies into makeshift coffins to jetting around with the European Command.  You get a real sense of what it is like.  You can see that Wilson has given his best in the service of America, and he's proud to be an American who loyally served both Republican and Democratic administrations.  He worked on several projects to bring democracy to Africa and I respect him for that.<br />Flash forward to 2002.  A retired Wilson is asked by the administration to check out a report on the sale of uranium to Iraq in Niger.  Niger is one of the countries in which Wilson had served and he knew the rulers who were in power during the alledged sale.  Therefore he was the most qualified for the mission whether his wife recommended him or not.  To get lectures about nepotism from Republicans, is like getting diet advice from the candy store.  After his trip, he concluded that the reports were false, and reported that to the administration.  Several months later, Wilson finds out that the President used the report of uranium sales in Niger in his State of the Union address to justify war in Iraq.  When it was exposed as false, the administration claimed ignorance despite having the report from Wilson, and also reports from two other sources disclaiming the sales.  Wilson, angry at the bald-faced lies, exposed them.  The administration, instead of finding the culprit who put lies into the President's mouth, went for revenge on Wilson.  They tried to smear his reputation, and when that didn't work, they revealed the identity of his undercover CIA agent wife, putting national security and intelligence assets at risk.  This is plainly traitorous and illegal.  This is the same Bush administration that might be re-elected this year.  Be sure that you read this book before you go to the polls.  Don't let this administration stab you in the back like it did to Joseph Wilson.	2004-07-13

Then you could use the advice in this book.  First of all, this is not a how-to book.  It doesn't show you how to develop characters, or structure a story, or tell you how to write.  What it does give you is information on the daily life and habits of professional screenwriters.  One of the most important pieces of advice is to just write.  Too often, a beginning screenwriter will spend years to write one script and then shop it around.  This is a big mistake for several reasons.  A movie producer is looking for someone who can work reliably at speed.  If you've only written one script, they're going to be suspicious about your abilities.  Another thing is that producers are very busy, so if you get one of them to finally read your script, it's going to be the first and last chance.  Do you really want to show him your first script?  It's trash to him.  Would you send your first painting to an art gallery?  Of course not, so you shouldn't do the same with screenwriting.  You should have written 5 to 10 screenplays before you think of showing your work around.  Most aspiring screenwriters don't want to put in this work, and it shows.  If you write, you will get better.  If you love writing, and you can apply yourself to your writing, then you can have a chance to work in Hollywood.	2004-07-05

Unfortunately the stories are deadly boring.  It seems like they passed off the writing to the writers who were rejected from the show.

Herman and Noam Chomsky, it is far from free.  They argue that the media in America serves to promote the agenda of the elite class in American society.  In other words, the media only provide one-sided news coverage.  Their main point is that while the misdeeds of enemy nations are widely criticized, the misdeeds of America and American client states are rarely publicized.  It's sad when Americans wonder why they are hated by those in other countries.  They wonder because they simply don't know what's going on in the world in the name of the American people.  The press refuses to print it, not due to any direct control by the government, but because those who control the halls of power are a small elite, and the chiefs of media are a part of that small circle.  They have the same boss--multinational corporations.<br />Let's look at one the examples from the book--Central America in the 80's.  During this period, the media spent a lot of time demonizing the Sandinista government of Nicaragua.  Herman and Chomsky claim this focus was hypocritical considering the conditions in nearby El Salvador and Guatemala, both ruled by American-supported military governments.  In these American client states, there were government-controlled death squads which terrorized and killed political opponents in a bloodbath beyond imagining.  If you were going to start labelling terror states, these two states at the time would have been at the top of the list.  However, the coverage of these atrocities was weak because it's easy to do business with a tightly-ontrolled military government.  On the other hand, Nicaragua, with a type of communist government, was difficult to do business with, so we get lots of negative reports about Nicaragua even though the level of violence wasn't anywhere near the level of violence in the American client states, and if you didn't notice, the majority of violence against Nicaraguan citizens was committed by American backed Contras.  So much for America's support of liberty and freedom across the globe.  I guess the freedom that really matters is the freedom to grow cheap bananas for the world's supermarkets.<br />As an American citizen myself, I'm worried about such media propoganda leading us down the wrong road.  For example, if the media had bothered to do its job before the Iraq War, they would have done a little more investigation inot the Bush administration's bogus WMD claims and its close ties with the oil industry.  We would have saved a lot of American and Iraqi lives.  I recommend reading this book so that you can see what is really going on with the coverage of the American government's activities overseas.  Don't let a few bad men ruin our international reputation.	2004-06-12

A lot of the book on ninjas cover either ninja legends or &quot;ninjitsu&quot; which is a kind of reconstructed martial art which is practiced mainly by American ninja fans and Japanese who are working at ninja theme parks.  Turnbull strips all this away and shows us what an authentic ninja was like.  The real ninja was a mercenary who specialized in espionage, sabotage, and assassination.  The image of a black-clad ninja is perhaps inaccurate.  The point of espionage is not to get noticed, so ninja were more likely to be dressed as everyday people in order to infiltrate towns and castles.  There are, however, lots of illustrations and photos of black-clad ninjas.  Perhaps undercover ninjas are not so interesting to look at.  The time period covered is 1460-1650 which was the golden age of ninjas, and which roughly corresponds to the Sengoku (Warring States) period of Japanese history.  After this time period, Japan was in a state of peaceful unification and isolation which rendered the ninjas obsolete.<br />One great point of this book is that it introduces the excellent ninja museum in Iga-Ueno in Mie prefecture.  I've visited this museum and they have a ninja house and a wonderful collection of fascinating ninja tools.  The highlight of visiting the museum is the excellent ninja show.  If you visit the Osaka or Kyoto area, and you have an extra free day, I recommend that ninja fans visit this place and check it out.	2004-06-09

It consists of mainly two parts.  The first part consists of essays and interviews with Adams that have appeared in magazines and on the internet.  Hitchhiker fans will especially love &quot;Young Zaphod Plays it Safe.&quot;  The second part is an unfinished novel by Adams.  The first part is satisfying because you can see Adams' character shining through.  In these writings, different facets of his personality sparkle for all to see.  The second part is unsatisfactory though.  It is patched together from a few early drafts, and it is unpolished.  Second, it only consists of a few chapters, so the story stops midway through without any resolution, which is a little frustrating.  Perhaps this volume would have been better if it had focused on the essays and letters of Adams and left the unfinished novel alone.

He is particularly critical of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.  The worst trait of the Bush administration is it's obsession with secrecy.  Not since the Nixon administration have we had a President who is so secretive.  Dean worries that this secrecy endangers our democracy.  For example--why won't Dick Cheney release the names of the members of his secret energy commission?  Is he afraid that it will be discovered that the White House did favors for criminals such as Enron's Ken Lay?  If there is nothing to hide, why is Cheney going to so much trouble to keep this information secret?<br />When you think of Nixon, you think of enemies lists.  Bush certainly likes to keep track of his enemies and he likes to see them punished.  The biggest example of this is when the cover of Ambassador Joe Wilson's wife was blown.  To blow the cover of an undercover agent is an impeachable offense and it is considered to be treason.  However a senior staff member of the Bush White House though nothing of this, and released the information after Ambassador Wilson made statements critical of the Bush administration.<br />Also Dean goes into the deception behind the Iraq War.  The lies that went into starting this war are so numerous, it's hard to count them all.  How can American citizens exercise their democratic duties when the average American doesn't even know if his government is telling him the truth or not?  Our freedoms are in danger and it's time that we wake up and seriously look at what's happening in the White House.  This was a great read and you should read this before the election, if you have a chance.	2004-05-15

For many English speakers, it is difficult to explain some of the more esoteric points of grammar.  In my experience, I've found that most grammar books are too basic, are filled with lots of unnecessary grammar exercises, or are difficult to use.  This book, however, is easy to use and is created for the English teaching professional rather than for the English student.  It's a breeze to check up on difficult points.  All of the grammar points are listed in alphabetical order in an encyclopedic manner.  In my teaching career, I've been asked many difficult questions that were difficult for me to answer.  Every time, Swan's Practical English Usage came to my rescue.  Every English teacher should have a copy of this one.	2004-05-15

The activities here are not short activities.  They generally range from 30 minutes to 1 hour in length.  This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your requirements.  If you're looking for short warm-up ideas to begin class with, this book is not a good source.  Also, if you have a tightly planned curriculum, you may find it difficult to fit these activites in.  I find that these activities are good when you have to teach a class unexpectedly and you need a quick plan.  Most of these activities can be stretched to a whole hour.  Be warned though.  These activities are for fairly high level students and include a lot of discussion and story-making ideas.  If your students are mostly low-level students, you may not find this to be very useful.  If your needs call for long activities for high-level students, this is a wonderful book.	2004-05-15

As any classroom teacher knows, games often add life to a class that is about to fall asleep.  They add energy to a class and give the students a little burst of motivation.  This book covers a wide variety of games for teaching English as a second language.  The games are divided into discrete categories.  For example some of the categories are psychological games, magic tricks, story games, and memory games.  Since the games are divided in this way, it becomes easy to find the game that will suit your classroom goals.

When he talks about music, he means pop, but not in the narrow sense of the term.  Pop by his definition includes rock, reggae, country, R&amp;B, rap, and so on.  Through examining 31 songs, Hornby explores the many facets of pop.  Some people would claim that pop is just junk or throw-away music, but Hornby claims this is actually one of the good points of pop music.  Pop doesn't reach for immortality because it has the maturity to admit that immortality is impossible.  Hornby is particularly critical of classical music.  He claims it makes no sense to listen to music that has already been over-analyzed and has had the life drained out of it.  There's nothing new to learn or experience.  Whereas pop fans will always find something new or refreshing.  Fans of pop enjoy the mystery of &quot;figuring out&quot; a song and when they're done, they move on to the next one.  The puzzle is never complete.  The challenge is eternal.<br />If you're a fan of music, you have to read this book.  Even if you don't agree with Hornby's opinions, you'll think about pop music in a different way.  You'll find new life in your CD collection.  Rediscover your love of music.	2004-05-10

One day her father, a hat seller, dies and leaves the girls with their step-mother.  The youngest goes to live with a witch to learn magic.  The second sister goes to work at a bakery.  Sophie is stuck with the hat shop.  One day, an evil witch, the Witch of the Waste, comes in and without explanation turns Sophie into an old woman.  Sophie decides to leave the hat shop and find her own destiny.  After leaving the town, she runs into a huge moving castle.  This castle belongs to Wizard Howl who is know to steal the souls and eat the hearts of young girls.  Believing herself to be too old for Howl's morbid tastes, she decides to enter the castle.  Perhaps Wizard Howl can lift the spell she is under.  This begins Sophie's adventure.<br />For fans of fantasy, this is an excellent book.  Diana Wynne Jones is an excellent storyteller.

The information is classified by spice or ingredient type.  Each spice is given a two-page spread in which information is given about the taste, appearance, source, history, and cultural signifigance of the spice.  Also two recipies are given which use the spice mentioned.  The recipies are nice, but I think that the main function of this book is to introduce the spices common in the Indian kitchen.  The book is filled with full-color pictures throughout, and it will please any serious foodlover.  If you already know a lot about the spices used in Indian cooking and are more interested in recipies, perhaps you should look for a more focused cookbook.  For beginners to Indian cooking, this is a perfect introduction.	2004-05-05

Daneel Olivaw, Book 1)	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	Thrilling Detective Story	In the future of Asimov's Caves of Steel, human society has been spit in two.  On the Outer Worlds, 50 planets that had been colonized by humans, populations are low and humans work hand-in-hand with robots.  On Earth, the population has exploded out of control, and the humans live in giant city-hives (the Caves of Steel mentioned in the title), and they never venture into the open air.  They live in a tightly controlled socialist system and most humans detest robots as job-stealers.  Elijah Baley, a police detective, gets a call from the New York City police commissioner.  A Spacer, as the inhabitants of the Outer Worlds are known, has been murdered by an Earthman.  If the crime isn't solved, then there will be terrible diplomatic problems for Earth which may even lead to the invasion of Earth by the Spacers.  To help him out, he is given a Spacer partner who also happens to be an advanced robot.  Can he get along with his partner?  Can he avert the destruction of human society on Earth?<br />This is a very easy read.  It's easy to see why Asimov is considered to be one of the best science fiction writers of all times.  He keeps the plot twisting and surprises you in the end.  Recently, we've been bombarded with the image of robots as out-of-control menaces.  It's refreshing to see a robot as a true helper and friend fo mankind.  I would like to see more emphasis on this type of robot in the future of science fiction.  It give us more to think about when the danger in a story comes from human attitudes rather than from blood-thirsty robots.  You really have to think about how you would react if you were placed in a similar situation.  I'm really looking forward to reading the next book in this series.	2004-05-05

It has become increasingly popular in the last few years.  Maeroff looks at the main issues confronting it.  For instance, many people are concerned about the legitimacy of degrees earned online.  Can people learn as well through the internet as they do in a classroom?  Is the personal contact that students get in the classroom a vital part of the education process?  Despite these problems, internet education is growing in popularity, not only for college students and professionals, but also for high school students as well.  This book looks at how this is affecting the world of education, and it examines what problems face learners and instructors in implementing this new style of education.<br />Basically, Maeroff comes to the conclusion that online education is mostly suitable for professionals looking to improve their job skills.  It's not very suitable for liberal arts students who need more personal contact to discuss abstract ideas or high school students who tend to have trouble motivating themselves to keep the schedule required for online study.<br />If you're looking for a guide to online programs, this is not the book for you.  This book is for education professionals who want some insight into this new educational method, or for students who want to learn about online education from the inside perspective.	2004-04-29

It gives a lot of history for the period and a few character types, but I found it to be incomplete.  It doesn't give enough information for running a game.  For example, if you want to run an Indiana Jones type game, you'll need to buy the WWII sourcebook for information about Nazis.  If you want to do the Mummy, you'll need to buy the Egypt sourcebook for information on mummies and pyramids.  If you want to steal jewels in an ancient Aztec temple, you have to buy the Aztec book.  The list goes on and on.  If you have a good idea of what kind of story you would like to play, it would be better to get the sourcebook directly related to that story.

During this period, Japan was shattered into dozens of minor statelets.  This period see the destruction of the shogunate, a long period of civil wars between the statelets, and the eventual reunification of Japan and the return of the shogunate under the Tokugawa.  This period is of particular interest to fans of the samurai.  This period is the last time in history in which samurai were the fierce warriors they are depicted to be.  After this period, the samurai become glorified bureaucrats during the 250 years of peace during the Tokugawa shogunate.  They only take up arms for a brief period during the fall of the shogunate, but it doesn't match anything that happened during the Sengoku Period.<br />This book is a fairly thin volume at only 96 pages.  However, it is filled with lots of details and colorful illustrations.  For samurai fans, this can serve as a great introduciton to the history of the greatest period of the samurai.	2004-04-20

He takes a look at their heros--ancient gods, samurais, kamikaze pilots, and yakuza.  He presents the idea that Japanese are free from a sense of morality and are governed by a sense of social obligations.  This, he explains, is the reason that we find sex and violence so openly in Japanese entertainment.  He also states that these act as a sort of release for people who are burdened with overwhelming social obligations.<br />I found this book interesting, but this book was published in 1984 orginally, so when Buruma refers to popular culture, it is quite outdated.  When talking about movies, he refers primarily to movies from the 60's.  For other forms of entertainment, the references come from the late 70's and early 80's.  His references don't reflect the current impact that Japanese pop culture is having on the world today.  Also the strong cultural institutions, such as lifetime employment, that he talks about have been breaking down since the Japanese economy collapsed in the late 80's and early 90's.  Presently, Japanese society is in a state of flux.  Despite this, you'll still find lots of interesting observations in this book.	2004-04-16

In this book, Nabokov presents us the Native American perspective from prophecy to present.  By reading the testimony of Native Americans themselves, we get a clear picture of their plight.  This book doesn't give a detailed history of Native Americans, but rather gives us a finger on the pulse of the Native spirit.<br />Native Americans have lost a great deal.  When Europeans first arrived in North America, they did what they could to help these new brothers, and were happy to share what they had.  However, the Europeans kept on coming and they started taking what didn't belong to them.  The Europeans started fencing off the native lands.  They destroyed the land and the animals with their greed.  The Native Americans were continually pushed off their ancestoral lands and were driven to less desirable lands.  They suffered the loss of their lands, traditions, and way of life.  It's important for us as Americans to examine this sad episode of our history.  We should take this lesson and apply it to our lives, and think about how we treat others who are different from us.  I really recommend this book to those who are interested in reading the other side of the history of our nation.	2004-04-07

The prisoners are all Union men being held by the Confederacy in Richmond.  After they escape in the balloon, they get caught in a great storm and are wrecked on an unknown island in the Pacific Ocean.  They start with absolutely nothing, but they manage to build a comfortable life with their knowledge.  The members include an engineer, his servant, a journalist, a sailor, and a boy.  The engineer is the main hero.  It is his knowledge which helps the party to build their perfect little world.  Without him, the party would probably perish.  The sailor serves as comic relief.  He is always making funny remarks.  Basically they enjoy their life on the island, but they face some crises, and receive help from a mysterious source.  As the book progresses, the mysterious coincidences build up.<br />This is a good book for survival fans.  It's interesting to see how they are able to build their mini civilization from nothing.  If you're not interested in island survival though, you may get bored with the details on how to make a pottery kiln, or building a blacksmith's forge, or the search for edible plants.  One point I didn't like very much was the character of the servant.  As an African-american, he's a little too subservient--a kind of Uncle Tom type who lives to serve his master.  That's really out-of-date now, which is why this is not one of Vernes better works.  If you haven't read any of Verne's works, I recommend 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and Journey to the Moon instead.  If you've read a lot of Verne, this is a solid book, but not his best.	2004-03-26

Chalmers Johnson presents this idea in this book.  America, the lone superpower, is setting up an empire not of territory, but of military bases and economic policy.<br />The first point he sets up is the militarization of the American government.  He argues that the increasing web of military installations (over 700 in a post-Cold War world!) drains more and more resources from our nation.  As the superpower within our own government, the military has become powerful with the cooperation of the military-industrial complex.  One of the key features of this military style of government is the increase in secrecy.  Americans have a right to know what their government is doing, but more and more documents are labeled &quot;Top Secret&quot;, so increasingly, Americans are unaware of what their government is doing around the world, and the government is working harder and harder to make sure that no one finds out what it is doing.  What kind of government would seriously consider setting up an agency to dispense disinformation and lies to cover its own tracks?  If you answered the United States, you're correct.  Also, the military is taking over many of the functions of the civilian government.  During the Bush administration, the responsiblilites of diplomacy (stolen from State) and information gathering (stolen from the CIA) have drifted into the military's sphere of influence.  As more responsibility is pulled into the secre world of the military, Americans risk losing control of their government.<br />Johnson also looks into the idea of globalization, and how it is used by the American government to control the world economy and keep smaller nations under control.  For example, Johnson points out that nations that followed IMF stipulations in recent economic crisises are now in worse condition, while those who did it their own way (which is the same way that America had built its power) could improve their economies.  In other words, globablization is a way of kicking away the ladder after getting to the top.<br />As an American, I am worried about the direction America is headed in.  If you're worried about the future of America, I recommend this book.	2004-03-15

First things first--this is not a regular guidebook in that it doesn't show an endless list of cities that you will probably never visit.  Instead, he figures that you'll have less than two weeks for your vacation, so he picks out the places that he thinks you will enjoy the most.  If you are looking for a more complete listing, then another guidebook would be better.  Getting back to the guide, he has a particular flair for finding the scenic beauty of this region of Europe, and he gives lots of advice for finding those picture perfect spots that you're looking for.  Also, Steves is good at tapping into the beer hall scene, so if you're thinking of checking out Bavaria, you'll be able to get some good tips.  Of course, you can get better recommendations from a local though.  Just think of this as a starter kit, and once you make a few contacts and start talking to the locals, you'll be able to find the places that aren't list in any guidebook.<br />Another good thing about this guidebook is that the maps are fairly easy to follow.  The downtown maps for cities are especially good.  However, this book is for train travelers.  If you are going to be driving, you'll need to pick up a seperate road map because there aren't any good road maps in this guidebook.	2004-03-15

However, John doesn't give in and he holds onto his faith.  With each rejection, she becomes angrier and angrier.  In the end, she is driven to bloodlust, and orders for the head of John the Baptist.<br />The language of this play is beautiful to read and highly poetic.  This is one of the best plays for reading.  Of course you can draw your own conclusions as to the relationship between lust and bloodlust.  False passions lead to bad ends.	2004-02-27

He wasw a samurai in the middle of the nineteenth century.  He is considered a hero by his native Japan.  His story begins when Commodore Perry brings his American ships to open Japan by force.  Many samurai were insulted by this gunboat diplomacy.  Sakamoto was one among many who called for the government to expel these foreign interlopers.  However, it was more easily said than done.  As time passed, Sakamoto came to realize that Japan was in no position to challenge the West because the West had vastly superior weapons.  He came to admire the position of strengthing the country through international trade and emulating those institutions that were admirable in the West.  For Japan to defend itself, it had to become a strong country and the only was to do that was by modernizing.  To modernize, the military government of the Shogun had to be overthrown.  This leads to the Meiji Restoration in which the Emperor takes back the power to rule from the Shogun.  Unfortunately, in the process, Sakamoto is assassinated, which made him a martyr for the process of modernization.<br />This book follows the events leading up to the Meiji Restoration, and it especially focuses on Sakamoto's role in setting it up.  It provides an overview leading up to this period and shows that there were many factors which lead to the overthrow of the Shogun.  Perry's arrival was only a trigger that unleashed years of frustration.  To get a better grasp of Japanese politics, I think this book is an excellent source for understanding the founding of the modern Japanese state.	2004-02-27

There are three main parts in this book.  The first part deals with how to obtain a position in Japanese university.  This part is a little bit dated because this book was published in 1993.  The market is a bit tighter now with universities feeling the crunch of a declining university population.  However there is some useful information concerning the fact that most Japanese universities don't usually give foreigners tenure track positions.  In fact, foreigners are usually limited to a three or four year contract and then booted out of the country.  Don't take this kind of position.  It's exploitation.  Also these positions tend to give instructors heavy class loads of nonacademic classes, and as a result, foreign instructors rarely publish, which is of course not very good for your career.  Don't perpetuate this system by signing on.<br />The second part deals with teaching certain subjects in the Japanese university class.  Some of the subjects covered are listening, writing, literature, and so forth.<br />The most valuable part of this book is the third part which goes into detail about the culture of Japanese university students and the politics of Japanese academia.  This section is good reading for anyone who is interested in the workings of the Japanese education system.<br />Overall, this is a great book and the only problem is that it's due for a new edition.  If you're looking for a university position in Japan, just remember it's all about networking.  Get this book for it's cultural insights rather than for jobhunting advice and you'll be satisfied.	2004-02-10

Unfortunately, this style clashes with the highly ideological Bush administration.  From the beginning, O'Neill was shocked by the ignorance of the President.  Bush never read the reports O'Neill sent and didn't even bother to read the newspapers (yes you may be better informed than the President).  He only listed in a bored and disengaged way.  In other word, the administration is adrift without a rudder.  It's no wonder that lots of unfortunate decisions have been made.<br />By reading this book, you can gain an inside view of what is happening inside the White House.  You can see how this disfunctional administration is controlled by the political arm headed by Karl Rove and Dick Cheney, and how they viciously pursue their radical right agenda without much concern for the real world or hard facts.  If you care about the future of America, you should pick this up before the election, so that you can make an informed choice.	2004-02-10

If you are, this is a necessary guide which gives you all the basics--from applying to graduation and beyond.  One of the most important points is that you have to prepare for graduate school early.  Don't wait until after you're accepted to choose your advisor.  You shouldn't even apply until after you select your advisor.  This point of advice saves a lot of heartache later on, because having a good relationship with your advisor is one of the single most important things in graduate school.  If you have a suitable advisor, graduate school will go more smoothly.<br />Another thing I like is that it doesn't try to sugarcoat the graduate school experience.  It tells you exactly that graduate school is a rough experience and that out of all the people who enter graduate programs, only 8% go on to academic work.  If you can't face these facts, then you probably aren't driven enough to succeed in a graduate program.  If you're still burning for higher education and are willing to face the difficulties involved, you're ready for graduate school.  Basically you should go in with both eyes open.  I recommend picking up this guide to help you through your postgraduate life.	2004-02-10
US	52700359	RGCUAE9J9OMCN	1573229326	319964836	How to Be Good	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good	Hornby does it again with this great story.  He is an expert at depicting troubled human realationships.  In this one, the main character is Dr. Katie Karr, a self-professed good person who feels that all that was good in her life has melted away.  She's married to David, who writes an angry newspaper column called the &quot;Angriest Man in Holloway.&quot;  In his free time, he writes a mostly worthless novel.  They have two children who cause a lot of stress.  Katie has just started an affair because she feels unloved by her bitter and angry husband.  However, by the time the secret is revealed, David has come into contact with DJ GoodNews, a new age faith healer.  This encounter with GoodNews causes David to completely flip his personality.  He becomes a complete angel, but over time he starts making grandiose plans to save the world.  Which is worse, the angry David or the crazy David?  Can they hold their family together as David becomes more eccentric?<br />While it's true that this one is not quite as good as High Fidelity or About a Boy, it's still a great book with lots of insight into the crazy conformity of suburbia, and what happens when it is disrupted by some original thinkers.  Is it bad to be too good? Is there such a thing as &quot;too good?&quot;  Read and decide for yourself.	2004-01-27
US	52700359	R3259TVET0RU5V	0061015725	245555180	Prey	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Fun, but fluff	Crichton shows us the dangers of nanotechnology in his latest novel.  In this case, a swarm of nanomachines escapes a military sponsored lab and go beserk as they evolve an even greater intelligence.  It's a really fun read, as Crichton novels tend to be, but I can't give this book full marks.  As usual, Crichton falls into his usual patern--a group of scientists or professionals, who by chance are also beautiful supermodels, face the current scientific hot topic, except it has gone terribly out of control.  In the process, half of the members die, and those who survive face an ambiguously happy ending which gives Crichton the option to make a sequel.  This describes about 90% of Crichton's novels, and it describes this one pretty well.<br />Another weak point of this particular novel is that the solution to the problem is presented fairly early in the story, and you have to read through hundreds of pages and witness several pointless deaths before the hero figures it out.  Usually Crichton is good at giving you some twists at the end, but in this book, it plods straight ahead to the ending you expect.<br />In the end, I can't say this is a great book, but it is an entertaining book.  If you have enjoyed Crichton's formulamatic books before, you'll probably enjoy reading this one.  If you got bored to death reading one of his other books, be warned, this is more of the same.	2004-01-20

Other than that, this book is a bit of a mess.  The problem comes from the layout of the book.  The game itself is a nonlinear game, and the book tries to be a nonlinear book.  THe problem with that is that it jumps around too much.  Using this book, it's difficult to follow the course of action, and impossible to get a 100% complete.  It would have been better if they had chosen a certain course, and then presented a walkthrough for that course.<br />Another thing which wasn't very good in my opinion was that the item list wasn't very helpful.  If an item isn't sold in a store, then you wouldn't know how to get it.  You'd have to spend about 15 minutes looking through the creature list to find out if you can get it from a creature or not.  If you can't, then it would be impossible to find where to get it using this book.  You'd have to find it by chance.<br />Basically, I found that this book gives you lots of information that you already know, or is in the game, or is easy to figure out.  The really difficult things are hardly covered and the detailed information that you need isn't even covered.  I would pass on this.  You can find better guides elsewhere.	2004-01-15

During this period, Japan was shut off from the outside world and developed a unique culture.  When people think of old Japan, this is usually the period they think of thanks to the great number of period dramas that depict this era.<br />The book examines the social divisions of this period.  The four main groups are the samurai, the farmers, the craftsmen, and the merchants.  Each group has an entire section devoted to it which details the lifestyle of each group.  After this, several outsider groups are considered.  The book ends with a general overview of life in the old capital Edo which is now called Tokyo.  For those who are looking for a resource for information on the world of the samurai, this book gives a good overview of their world.<br />My only complaint about this book is that it was published in 1969, so the writing style feels a little dated and it seems it was written for a Western audience which was unfamiliar with Japanese culture.  Basically, it's style is dated, but the information is accurate and useful.  Anyone who is interested in Japan and doesn't know well about the history of Japan will find this to be a great introduction	2004-01-15

This will bring it all back to you in one book.  The topics covered are current events, fashion, music, TV, and movies.  Special attention is paid to the last three especially.  I think fans of 80's music will love this the most.  It covers everything from Lionele Richie, to Madonna, to Depehe Mode.  As for movies, don't forget E.T., The Breakfast Club, and Back to the Future.  In the realm of TV, The A Team comes on strong, the Dukes of Hazard wreck their car, and Arnold says &quot;Whatchootalkinabout Willis?&quot;<br />This will be a great gift for anyone who was a TV child in the 80's.  If you're a child of the 80's, you should get it for yourself.	2004-01-15
US	52700359	REG3DLVAYBHPF	0805074007	932608591	Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance (The American Empire Project)	Books	5	25	38	N	N	Keeping the World Safe	In theis book, Chomsky lays out his opinion of American power in the world.  His basic premise is that the American government will do anything to protect it's economic interests and it's global power, even if it includes supporting acts that could be considered terrorism.  For example, all of the worst war crimes that Saddam Hussein committed were during the time when Iraq was a client state of the United States.  Chomsky argues that the definition of terror isn't applied equally to all nations.<br />For example, consider the case of Emmanuel Constant.  Constant was a leader of a paramilitary force in Haiti which was responsible for the deaths of thousands in the early 90's.  Haiti has repeatedly requested for the extradition of Constant, so that he can face trial for his crimes.  However, the U.S. refuses to do so.  Would it be justifiable for Haiti to bomb New York in an attempt to recover Constant and to punish the government that protects him?  Most people would say no, but they would support a similar case--the invasion fo Afghanistan to find Bin Ladin.  Why the double standard?<br />ANother point he covers is the atrocities committed by the Israeli government against the Palestinians and by the Turkish government against the Kurds.  These campaigns kill thousands and terrify the local populations, but they aren't call terrorism because they are campaigns supported by the American government.  If we're going to have a war against terror, shouldn't we be a little more objective?<br />This book was an excellent read.  I recommend this book for those who want to think seriously about America's role in the world.	2004-01-11
US	52700359	RHEGX2PQYWF82	0226300412	97204488	001: The Meaning of Shakespeare, Volume 1 (Phoenix Books)	Books	5	57	58	N	N	Simply the Best	This first volume covers Shakespeare up to Hamlet.  For later plays, see volume two.  In my opinion, Goddard is by far the best critic of Shakespeare's plays.  He far outranks Bloom, who seems to be the popular Shakespeare critic these days.  Goddard gets to the heart of the characters and stories without being sidetracked by modern ideologies and -isms.  He doesn't try to distort the plays for something they are not.<br />I particularly love the comedies of Shakespeare and Goddard gives them the attention they deserve that other critics don't.  His insight into these lighter works are quite interesting.  If you are more interested in Shakespeare's tragedies rather than his comedies or histories, you should get volume two instead, however I recommend getting both.<br />As for the writing style, it is very enjoyable and not at all scholarly or incomprehensible.  Actually I've read both volumes over and over, and I consider them to be a few of the best books in my library.  They are a must have for Shakespeare fans.	2004-01-04

It includes over 600 enteries of Japanese grammar points listed in alphabetical order for easy reference.  For those looking for a text for learning Japanese, this isn't a good choice because most of the enteries have only one example for each usage.  However, it's great for people who have studied or are studying Japanese.  I use it for checking points which I don't often use and easily forget.  If you're going to study Japanese, you could use this as a reference for your studies.  If you are looking for clear explanations rather than reminders, you should find a more comprehensive book.	2004-01-04

It covers the history of piracy from the ancient world until the modern age.  The bulk of the material, however, covers the golden age of piracy in the Carribean Sea and the Indian Ocean.  The format of the book is very large with full color pictures on every page.  Basically it's a coffee table book.  The color pictures definitely stir the imagination.  Fan of pirate lore and fans of the recent movie &quot;Pirates of the Carribean&quot; will be pleased to read this.<br />My only complaint is that the text is a little light.  Even famous pirates such as Blackbeard and Captain Morgan only get two pages each.  I realize that some text space had to be sacrificed for all the color pictures, but I was hoping for a little more information.  If you're interested in pictures or if you aren't such a heavy reader, this will be a great book for you.  If you would like something a little meatier, perhaps another book is for you.  I do think this is an excellent source for pictures of pirates though.	2004-01-04

He finds it impossible to connect with his fellow humans, and in fact, fears them.  He is afraid of what they think of him.  He puts on the face of a clown, but he is totally crushed when he is found out to be a phoney.  As he enters University, he comes to battle with alchohol and drugs.  The center of his misery is his inability to have a normal relationship with women.  However, the fault lies completely within himself and his terribly pessimistic attitude.<br />This was an interesting book, but I found it difficult to get into the head of the dark hero.  In this book, he finds no hope, and there are no ways to escape from his depression and his fear of society.  He can only escape.  It was difficult to fathom his point of view, but I think it helped me to understand the feelings of people who shut themselves away from society.	2003-12-28

First of all, this book is made up of Krugman's columns from the The New York Times and Fortune magazine, so there isn't a lot of new material in this book.  The good point is that these columns are collected into different categories, so you can see the flow of Krugman's reasoning clearly.<br />For me, the most interesting thing I learned is that Bush's tax cuts were completely unnecessary and benefited mostly rich and wealthy people.  For example the much talked about death tax is only applicable to estates over 3 million dollars.  The average person doesn't even pay death taxes, but the way Bush talks about it, you would think everyone is paying through the nose.  Krugman also goes on to outline how Bush lies about his budget numbers, something people don't often double-check.  It's good to see that consciencious economists such as Krugman are keep us informed.  Also Krugman points out Bush's crony capitalism.  It's commonly known that Bush only invites his friends to play, but Krugman gives some concrete examples.<br />This book is a must read before the 2004 election.  Inform yourself of the facts.	2003-12-28
US	52700359	R3ED8VJIRXITI2	1566915228	896846994	Rick Steves' Paris	Books	3	32	36	N	Y	Disappointing	I'm a fan of Steves' guides, but this one wasn't up to my expectations.  First, let me say what I liked.  Steves' recommendations for sights to see are excellent.  Also, his hotel and restaurant recommendations are on target.  Also, his city walks in Paris are very enjoyable.  This book is a great source for this kind of information.<br />The part which I found useless was the section of museum guides, which take up half of this book.  Steves seems to have written his museum guides for junior highschool dropouts.  I can't respect a guide which uses, for example, &quot;cultural fart noises&quot; to describe the Dada movement.  Throughout the museum guide section, he continues to make these kinds of childish remarks.  You get the impression that Steves doesn't like to spend time in museums, and he tries his best to rush you through them too.  As for the content, it't very light and tends to be of trivial nature.  He never goes into why the art is great.  If you get this book, just skip the museum guides.<br />One other thing that really bothered me was an out-of-place political comment in the section about the Babylonian collection in the Lourve.  He mentions that the area of Babylon has bee plagued by war and violence for over 5000 years (true enough).  Then he makes the unbelievable comment that in 2003 the violence came to an end when &quot;peace, prosperity, and democracy were established . . .by George W. Bush.&quot;  First of all, Iraq doesn't have any of those qualities in 2003, so it's just plain accurate.  Second, any progress made in Iraq is thanks to the American soldiers who risk their lives every day, not to Bush.  Lastly, strong political comments like that don't belong in a guidebook unless Steves plans to change the title to &quot;Rick Steves' Paris 2004 for Republicans&quot;.<br />As for my rating, the three stars are for the useful information in this book.  THe two missing stars are for the museum guide section which takes up half of the book.  Thepolitical comment didn't cost any stars, but a little bit of Steves reputation was tarnished.  Aside from the museum guides, it's a good book.	2003-12-18

Thankfullly, the reason is not due to racial or genetic sueriority, as some experts have claimed in the past.  In fact, according to Diamond, the reason beginins in the prehistory of humans.  The most important factors are the physical environment and the availability of easily domesticated plants and animals.  Also, Eurasian cultures benefited from an East-West axis, which promoted the spread of agriculture and crops, while other continents suffered from a North-South axis which retarded the spread of crops.  Those cultures which had access to these crops and a good environment to grow them in could increase their food production and population which in turn led to the development of government, writing, and technology.<br />Jared Diamond's background as an evolutionary biologist helps him to see the big picture. He's able to back away from the small details of history which often mislead other researchers.  I'm particularly interested in his idea that opportunity, not race or culture, was the prime derterminant in the rise of western culture.  My only complaint is that at times it seems that Diamond is repeating himself.  Perhaps if the editing had been a little tighter, he could have cut this book by about 25 to 30 pages.  Anyway, it's just a small complaint.  Overall this is an excellent book with some great ideas.	2003-12-11

Hanafuda was developed in Japan after the introduction of Western playing cards over 350 years ago.  Instead of the usual Jack, Queen, King configuration of cards, the Japanese developed a 48-card deck consisting of 12 suits, each of which has 4 cards.  The twelve suits represent the 12 months, and each month features a flower or plant that is in season for that month.  This reflects the Japanese sensitivity to the passing of the seasons.  Another difference is that the cards are smaller than Western playing cards and are made of a heavy card stock.<br />This book shows how to play this game.  It is basically a matching game in it's simplest form.  You attempt to match cards in your hand with those of the same suit in the discard area.  After you master the basic game, then you can try more complex forms in which you try to assemble special hands, similar to poker or mah jongg.<br />This is a really fun game, and it's cool factor is increased due to the fact that this game is traditionally associated with the Yakuza.  Try it out and show off your tough side.	2003-12-11

It follows the adventures of Holden Caulfield.  At the beginning of the book, Holden has just been expelled from his elite prep school.  In fact, this has been the third prep school he has flunked out of.  Holden's problem is that he is hypersensitive to the faults of others and he easily recognizes the hypocracy in the world.  He's always spotting out phonies and the irritating habits of others.  He goes into the city and falls into a depression and nearly loses his sanity.<br />This is a very powerful book.  If you have serious problems with depression, I would recommend avoiding this.  It won't be very good for your mental health.  However, if you are well-adjusted, this is an excellent book.  You can really delve into the mind of someone who is really losing their touch with society.  I'm sure that everyone has a little bit of Holden Caulfield in them.	2003-12-07

He doesn't defend the terrorists of 9-11, but he does say that there is cause and effect at work here.  According to his belief, he states that the United States has been one of the biggest terror states in it's support of dictators and repressive regimes throughout the world.  One such example is Turkey.  Turkey is executing a program to destroy the culture of the Kurds.  Chomsky insists that this is done with the knowledge and support of the U.S. government.  Also he puts forth the repression of the Palestinians in Israel and the farmland destruction in Columbia as other prime cases in which the U.S. in involved in terror.  <br />I thought one of the most interesting points made in this book is that Saddam was made by the Bush family.  All throughout the 1980's, Saddam was the U.S. pet to defend against a supposedly dangerous Iran.  During this time, he used poison gas on the Kurds.  The Republican administration then in power said nothing about it at all.  It's so ironic that the current Bush keeps bringing up the point of gas attacks against the Kurds, when it was an American supported and supplied Saddam who did it, and at the time it wasn't considered worth mentioning.  It only got brought up after Saddam refused to play the game.  It's ironic that our worst enemies are our own creations.<br />I found this book to be very insightful.  As some of the negative reviews have said, this is not really Chomsky's book, but edited together from various speeches and interviews that he has done.  Even though this is the case, I think it is very readable, and it contains a lot of information that is useful and thought-provoking.  Check it out.	2003-12-01

First of all, this isn't a guidebook.  This is basically a how to travel book.  It shows you how to travel the back door way.  In other words, travel as a guest rather than as a tourist.  It's unfortunate how many tourists are happy to be herded into tourist ghettos to be stripped of their cash.  This book shows how to avoid that, and how to enjoy Europe as the Europeans do.  Also this book gives good advice on how to travel cheaply.  I particularly admire Rick's philosophy of travel.  He advocates socially responsible travel, getting to know the local people, and experiencing what's unique in each country.  On the down side, Rick tries to be humorous, but a lot of the jokes are too corny.  However this doesn't bother me too much.<br />In the second half of the book, he gives some recommendations for back doors into Europe.  He covers all of the Western European countries.  The back doors are little touristed spots which really breathe the magic of Europe and reflect what tourists expect to see before they go.  After reading these, you won't be able to stay away from Europe.  I just felt that I wanted to visit all of the places he recommended.  At least visit one of these places, and I'm sure you'll be impressed with his skills for finding those perfect places.<br />If you're interested in a guidebook, you might want to buy one of Rick's country or city guidebooks.  In those, he goes into detail about the sights and places to stay.  If you're interested in some strategies for travel, and in recommendations for some very special places to visit, pick this book up.	2003-11-18

The main point he makes is that money is ruining the democratic system.  He backs up his claims with lots of exhaustive research.  I found his arguments to be quite persuasive.<br />One of the first points he covers is the 2000 election.  Being from Florida, this really touched me.  He shows how the Bush campaign used Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris to disenfranchise poor black Democratic voters.  Literally thousands were purged from the voter list in an election that Bush &quot;won&quot; by just over 500 votes.  This sort of vote tampering is just sad and immoral.<br />Another point that Palast covers is the inner workings of international organizations such as the IMF and the WTO.  He outlines how third world countries are being pillaged by the introduction of IMF requirements and free trade.  With the privitazation of national utilities, citizens in third world countries must face the tricks of American global corporations such as were experienced in California.<br />With all the money, corporate America has too much influence in the government.  Palast gives us a warning, so that we can wake up and take in interest in politics before it is too late. Check out this book.	2003-11-18

Sultan has lived through several represive regimes, all of which burned and censored his beloved books.  Now with the Taliban gone, he is free to pursue his business and his dreams of turning his large collection into a library for Afghanistan.<br />However, this story isn't all roses and sunshine.  The dark secret of his family (and of many others in the region) is the horrible mistreatment of the women in his family.  The lives of women are completely controlled by men in his society.  The women have to wera very restrictive clothing even after the fall of the Taliban.  They can't leave home by themselves and they have no say in who they marry.  They often have to marry men many years older than they are.  In one situation, a girl secretly spent 30 minutes alone with a boy just walking in the park.  As a result, she was severely beaten almost to the point of death, and she was locked in a room for more than a month.  After reading this book, you'll cry for the women in Afghanistan.  It's  a little heavy, but I recommend this book for everyone, and especially for those who are concerned about the well-being of women around the world.	2003-11-11

Huey is an activist type who does his best to bring social justice to the world and to expose hypocracy.  Riley, on the other hand, is obsessed with the thug life.  They mix like oil and water.  This is the first collection of th ecomic strip, so we get to see the boys movie to their grandfather's house in the white suburbs.  It's interesting to see the reactions of boys to the neighborhood and the neighborhood's reaction to the boys.  In his comic, McGruder uses his insight to highlight problems or misconceptions between the races.  It's important to have this kind of open format to discuss racial issues in order to improve racial relations.  Of course there are some closet racists out there who would like to have this comic disappear.  This comic is always threatened by cancellations in the newspaper, so pick up a copy of this book to help McGruder get the word out.  Also it's about time that we have a mainstream comic with black characters.<br />My favorite Boondock comics are the ones that make fun of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; Star Wars movie.  Those are included in this collection.  My favorite is when Jar Jar Binks becomes a black millitant in the vein of the Black Panthers.  Check it out.  It's hilarious.	2003-11-11

He chooses the cases of Bin Laden and Timothy McVeigh to illustrate his points.  He doesn't defend the actions of these two, but he makes the case that they were both provoked by the actions of the American government.<br />First in the case of Bin Laden, he focuses on the American government's interventionist streak.  Bin Laden is a man who was trained and supported by the CIA during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, and he subscribes to a fundamentalist form of Islam which is supported by the ruling Saud family which in turn is supported by the US government.  Basically we make our own villians these days.  Also he points out that many people in third world countries feel that having America or American supported troops in their country to do the bidding of corporate America is just humiliating.  As the poverty becomes worse, people will just become more desperate.  He makes the case that we should at least pretend to care, but too many Americans are caught up in their own minor problems to see that other people have it worse.<br />In the case of McVeigh, he thinks that Americans are becoming increasingly desperate due to the infringement of our freedoms, the build-up of a fascist-like police state, and the abuses of corporate America.  As Americans see their rights slipping away and come to feel more and more powerless in a corporate sponsored government, the will increasingly rebel in the future (although this seems to have been put on the back burner since we're focused on foreign terrorists now).  He makes the case that McVeigh was directly provoked by the government attack at Waco.  Basically he says that as long as the government treats the people violently, the will respond in kind.  Monkey see, monkey do.<br />Gore Vidal makes some very good points, and even if you don't agree with him, it's very interesting to read.  I recommend you try it.	2003-11-05

His time was spent teaching English literature at a teachers' college in Fuling city in the province of Sichuan.  The notable thing about this experience was that he was one of the first foreigners allowed in to that city since the communist revolution.  It's very interesting to see how the Chinese react to him.<br />One of the points I really liked was the point of view that the Chinese students had toward Western literature.  They have a very different way of interpreting such authors as Shakespeare and Cervantes.  Needless to say, they run into political problems as they delve into the themes of Western literature.  As an English teacher, this exploration and sense of discovery is what really inspired me in this book.  You can tell that Hessler really reached out to these kids and that they will be touched by their experiences in his class.<br />Another point is that this book presents the good and the bad sides of living in China.  Often these kinds of books degenerate into a forum for the author to vent his frustrations, and they become very negative.  Or in other cases, the authors become arrogant and show the people in other cultures as dancing bears to be laughed at or to be considered as oddities.  However, Hessler is able to keep this book well balanced, and you get a sense that even though there were some bad experiences, he really loved his time in China, and that it was an experience that he would treasure forever.  I'm glad that he decided to share his experience with us.  Hats off to Peter Hessler.	2003-10-29

The sotry is set in the late 19th century, and age of colonialism in Africa.  It is told by Alan Quartermain, an expert game hunter in South Africa.  He is contacted by Sir Henry Curtis, who wished to hire Quartermain as a guide to look for his lost brother.  Two years earlier, Curtis' brother left to find the legendary mines of King Solomon.  Fortunately, Quartermain had come into possession of a map showing the way to King Solomon's mines.  The pair are accompanied by Captain John Good, a naval officer whose habits of cleanliness become comic, and Umbopa, an African porter with a mysterious secret.  Needless to say, they encounter quite a few adventures along the way.<br />Something that might be found objectionable is the racial attitudes in this book.  There are several comments that modern readers may find uncomfortable.  However, if you keep in mind the time period this was written in, it's racial attitudes were more advanced than the general attitude of the time.  The African characters appear as human, but some of the characters make remarks which would not pass today.  If you can keep in mind the time period this was written in, I think you can enjoy this adventure, but if you are sensitive about racial remarks, then I recommend you give this a pass.	2003-10-23
US	52700359	R2WYIBS9884HU2	1888963123	933883208	BONE Treasure Hunters The Complete Bone Adventures VIII	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Less than expected	This is the eighth installment of the Bone series.  It continues to follow the adventures of the Bones and Thorn.  The big change in this story is that it moves from the outdoors to the city.  Nearly all of the action takes place in the city of Atheia.  Thorn comes closer to understanding her role in the world.<br />Generally speaking, I love the Bone series, and I have rated all of the previous books with five stars.  However there are some weak points in this book which prevent me from giving it five stars.  One point is that the shift from the outdoors to the city gives this book a rather cramped feel.  I believe that Jeff Smith has a certain talent for drawing outdoor scenes, and that talent doesn't seem to be in use in this book.  Another point is that a lot of new characters are introduced, which takes away page space from the characters we already know and love, and what is worse, the new characters are not in the least bit interesting.  They are all stock types.  Also I cringed to see the appearance of dwarfs and gnomes in the city.  One of the points I liked about the Bone series is the freedom it had from the typical swords and sorcery fantasy, but I guess he ran out of ideas.<br />Don't get me wrong.  It's not a bad book.  It's just not as good as the others.  Of course if you're following the Bone story, you have to get this.  Let's just hope that Smith regains his touch in the next book.  Oh, and no more gnomes please.	2003-10-23

Will Ferguson, the author of this book is one of the most arrogant persons to write a book.  Throughout the whole book, he shows a very negative attitude.  He complains about everything--the cities he visits, the people he meets, the culture, and anything he can get his hands on.  I was particularly irritated by the mean-spiritedness he displayed toward the people who picked him up during his hitchhiking trip through Japan.  He takes every opportunity to make trouble for them and he always insults them.  The impression I got was that he was a smart aleck.  It's no wonder he felt alienated in Japan.  He was doing his best to keep people away from him with his repulsive attitude.  I'm surprised he didn't title this book &quot;Why I Hate Japan&quot; or &quot;101 Stupid Japanese People I've Met.&quot;<br />Due to the bitterness in this book, I recommend you to avoid this one.  I've been living in Japan for 7 years now, and I can't see where he gets all of his negative ideas.  If you're interested in reading about experiences in Japan, I recommend &quot;Learning to Bow&quot; or one of Alan Booth's books instead.  Whatever you do, don't read this book.	2003-10-18

I don't agree with all of his points, but that's what it means to live in a free country--the freedom to have your own beliefs.  Basically, Maher makes some important points.  For example, Americans love empty gestures, but don't do anything to solve the problem.  Like putting a flag on their SUV, when it would be more helpful if they traded-in their SUV for a sub-compact.  As you can tell from the title, most of the issues he discusses deal with the issue of terrorism.<br />One of the great points of this book is that it is illustrated with full color posters done in the style of World War II posters.  These really drive home the message.  I've had friends who refused to accept some of the ideas in this book, but once they saw the poster illustrating that point, they admitted some truth to the point.  A picture really is worth a thousand words.  I give this book my highest recommendation.  Please read it and see for yourself.	2003-10-18

However this book is a little dated now.  Originally this was published in the 1960's, so it reflects a Cold War era point of view.  This especially comes through when he isn't talking about western cultures.  For example, he expresses a fear that the Islamic cultures, due to the large number of desperate and poor people, would abandon their traditional religion, Islam, and take up the banner of Communism.  Well, as we can see today, Islam will last a few thousand years longer than Communism.  Also there are a few mistakes in this book.  On a map showing the division of Spanish-speaking Latin America and Portuguese-speaking Latin America, countries such as Jamaica and Haiti are shown to be a part of Spanish-speaking Latin America.<br />It's not all bad though.  The section on the development of Europe is excellent.  Also this might be useful as a sort of time capsule.  Those who are interested in a Cold War view of history would like this. If you're looking for the history of civilizations though, you should look for a more modern and complete source.	2003-10-18

I found that it covered all the basics.  It covers all of the island nations in the Micronesia area.  The section on Palau and Yap were particularly useful to me.  However, I thought that there wasn't enough information about scuba diving.  Most of the people visiting this region are interested in scuba diving.  There isn't enough information on dive shops or dive sites.  In fact, there aren't any maps of dive sites at all.  If you're going to go diving, I would try another guidebook.  If you're just going to go sightseeing, this is just fine.  Also another thing I would like to see in the next edition is a few more photos.  Sometimes photos can help you decide whether to go to a place or not.  With more photos, I think this guidebook would attract more people to these lovely islands.	2003-10-12

It's packed with full-color photos on almost every page.  It seems almost like a National Geographic magazine.  In fact, this is why I like this guide.  It also has a lot of information about the culture, history, and people of Taiwan in the first half of the book.  The second half is dedicated to an overview of the major cities and sights in Taiwan.  Again, these are well illustrated with full-color photos on almost every page.<br />This guidebook has a few bad points though.  The section on hotels and restaurants is very weak.  You could probably find more information at the information counter at the airport.  Also, the maps are a bit difficult to read.  And finally, the transportation information is  entirely inadequate.  It doesn't tell you how to get around the country at all.  For me, this is the weakest point.  I feel uncomfortable traveling with this kind of guidebook.<br />I don't recommend using this as your primary guidebook.  I do recommend this as a secondary guide though.  It can help you choose destinations because it has a lot of full-color photos and also the culture section is excellent.  I think this book is especially good for armchair travelers.	2003-10-12

It's no wonder since Lonely Planet is based in Australia.  This guide is much more comprehensive than any of the other Lonely Planet guides I have used.  To get an idea, the Lonely Planet Australia guide is about the same thickness as the Lonely Planet Western Europe guide.  Is there really as much to see in Australia as in Western Europe?  I don't think so, but I'm not complaining.  I just wish the other guidebooks were as complete as this one.  This guide goes into great detail for every region of Australia.  There even listings for minor towns with populations of 200 or 300.  I don't think anything is left out.<br />As is usual with Lonely Planet guidebooks, this give great listings for reasonably priced hotels and restaurants.  Also it gives you great information on how to reach each location.  Oh, and it covers all the main sights, and a lot of the minor ones as well.  Basically, if you're going to go to Australia, you should pick this up.  You won't regret it.	2003-10-12

He challenges the Bush administration to answer some tough questions which have been boiling up recently.  For example, did you know that the Bush family has close personal ties with the bin Laden family?  It seems hard to believe, but it's true.  Do you know why we haven't put more pressure on Saudi Arabia for their support of terrorists?  It's because the Bush family is also close friends with the ruling Saud family.  Remember Enron?  Well, Ken Lay, the CEO of Enron, hasn't been charged with any crimes.  Could this be because he is a close friend of George W. Bush?  Are you starting to see a pattern?  It's a cozy little world, isn't it?  Too bad you aren't a part of it.<br />My favorite chapter is th eone in which he outlines how to stop terrorism.  Creating a PR department in the White House isn't one of the solutions.  Already people can't trust what the White House says, of the create a PR department to churn out propoganda, then it will just decrease people's confidence in what the government tells them.  The real solutions are things like treating our allies like allies and not like enemies.  Stop taking care of dictators and strongmen in third world countries.  And at least pretend to care about people's lives in third world countries (even better--actually CARE).  There is a lot of arrogance in our current foreign policy, and everyone notices that but us.<br />Also Moore goes after the filthy rich (as usual).  These rich are becoming richer and richer at the expense of everyone else.  He goes on to show how these rich have set up a system in which average people protect the priveledges of the rich because they dreat to be rich themselves someday, but the system is rigged.  The dream is still there, but the reality is different.  It's becoming more and more difficult to enter into the new aristocracy of the hyper-rich.  How much longer will it take for people to see the reality of the situation?<br />Well, this book is an entertaining and enlightening read.  If you enjoyed Moore's other books, you shouldn't hesitate to pick this one up.  Also, he give advice in his last chapter for action you can take to help change this administration.  Check it out and do what you can do to make this country and world a better place.	2003-10-12

Bush's America	Books	5	92	107	N	N	A Must Read Before the 2004 Election	Molly Ivins really lets the cat out of the bag in this one.  We've been living in the shadow of the Bush administration for a few years now, and she goes on to outline how the common man is getting along these days.  Unfortunately, the news isn't very good.  It seems that the common man is always getting the short end of the stick.<br />One of the major points she outlines is Bush's very close relationship with big business.  It's no secret that Bush was an oilman, and that oil companies had a big hand in forming the current energy policy.  She also points out that in many agencies meant to regulate industry, the head is someone from the very industry that is meant to be regulated.  How can we trust them to do their jobs?  And how can we tolerate government policy dictated by industry?  For example, the weakening of laws to protect workers, while fat cat industrialists get away with massive tax cuts and offshore tax shelters.  If Bush protects the loophole that allows offshore tax shelters, then he can't point his finger at anyone and call them unpatriotic.  Not paying taxes is unpatriotic.<br />Another point covered is Bush's nonsensical foreign policy.  During the Clinton administration, our country built up a lot of goodwill with the international community.  However, after Bush entered the White House through a Supreme Court appointment, we pulled out of the Kyoto Treaty (a treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emission--no mystery where he got that idea), the International War Crimes Court (perhaps he didn't want to be tried for starting a war in Iraq under false pretenses), and many more.  He goes to the UN with his mind made up to have a war, and when the world tried to talk him out of it, he stormed out and had his little war anyway.  Then he goes back after he made his little mess, and &quot;challenges&quot; the world to jelp rebuild Iraq.  I don't know what he was thinking, but nobody likes to be bullied around.  Americans have become targets not because of their freedoms (which are quickly being eroded by Bush's Patriot Acts), but because of the arrogance in foreign policy coming from the White House.<br />Also highlighted is Bush's two-sided domestic policy.  This book shows how Bush publicly states that he supports an issue, but when it comes down to it, he destroys it with the budget process by underfunding or cutting funds completely from those programs.  His No-Child-Left-Behind policy actually eliminates a lot of educational opportunities for children from poorer families.<br />I could go on and on, buy you should just read the book.  If you're an open-minded voter, you should check it out.  Also if you know someone who will be a first-time voter in the coming election, the best thing you could do would be to buy this book for them as a present.  Think of it as an investment in the future.	2003-10-07

You'll find that this book will help you to see the old traditional Kyoto.  It gives some history, background, and cultural information on old Kyoto.  The meat of this book gives information on shops, restaurants, and inns which represent old Kyoto.  Each one covered gets about two or three pages of description, so you can get a lot of information about each place featured, and you can really understand why each place is special.  Because the descriptions are so complete, you can enjoy reading about these places even if you aren't going to Kyoto.<br />I'm a resident of Kyoto, and I find that most of the places listed in this book aren't in the mainstream guides, so if you pick up this book in addition to a mainstream guide, there won't be much overlapping.  Also the places list here really give you a feel for old Kyoto.  If you have a few days in Kyoto, you should definitely stop by a few of these places.	2003-10-03

This book consists of enteries of common style, grammar, and word choice mistakes.

If you're a beginner, this book is a necessity.  As for me, I'm a casual photographer and I don't have my own darkroom.  I rent a darkroom about 4 times a year.  When I go to the darkroom, I always review this book the night before.  That way I can refresh my memory on the darkroom process.

It covers a wide range of art materials including paints, grounds, pencils, inks, printing equipment, cereamic tiles, stained glass, and so forth.

Basically it's a complete guide to the 2D mediums of art.  if you're interesting in 3D arts such as sculpture or pottery, you're not in luck.  Those fields aren't covered.<br />For me, it's interesting to just look through this book and examine the wide range of techniques and materials presented in it.

In this book, we can see how a mind can be driven along to evil through obsession.<br />The main character of this book is Mizoguchi.  He is the son of a poor rural priest.  He is taken by his dying father to become an acolyte at the Temple of the Golden Pavillion.  All throughout his childhood, his father had told him about the spledid beauty of this temple.  Mizoguchi builds up an image of ideal beauty in his mind based on this Golden Pavillion.  However, this ideal image causes him to feel disappointed in any supposed form of beauty, including women and even the actual physical Golden Pavillion.  Nothing can live up to this image of supreme beauty.<br />As he enters university, he comes under the influence of Kashiwagi, a fellow student with a very bitter view of life.  Under this influence, Mizoguchi's dark feelings bubble up inside him.  One of my favorite parts is Mizoguchi and Kashiwagi's discussion of knowledge and action.  Kashiwagi asserts that an unbearable life can be made bearable by just having the knowledge that it is unchangable.  However, Mizoguchi argues that knowledge is a dead thing, and that only action to change to change an unbearable life can make it bearable.  This attitude leads him to his final desperate attack.<br />I think that this book is particularly important in this age of terrorism.  Often people ask why do terrorist do what they do, and they ask this because they don't understand the obsession (whether in ideal beauty as in this book, or with fundamentalist religion as in the case with terrorists), the hopelessness, and the desperation that they feel.  I think if you read this book, you can understand how a mind is turned to evil acts through these means.  Please read this book, if only to understand this point.<br />A previous reviewer complained that ther isn't much action in this book, and that is true, but that's no reason to give it a low rating.  It's apsychological novel about the process of a mind on the road to evil, so naturally the main part of the story takes place in the mind.  If you want a novel with exploding cars, you should try a Tom Clancy novel instead.	2003-09-28

Samurai, ninjas, tea ceremony, karate, and kabuki?  Can you imagine a Japan without these things?  Actually this book describe just such a Japan.  In the Heian period (950-1050AD), Japan was dominated by life at the imperial court.  The ideal man was a gentle, poetry-writing aristocrat and the women were some of first novel writers in the world.  It contrasts greatly from the macho military culture that Japan is known for.<br />Morris gives a run-down of the world of Heian Japan.  As he gives this cultural information, he also offers passages fro &quot;The Tale of Genji,&quot; a literary masterpiece written by a woman (Murasaki Shikibu) in this period.<br />This book is great for people who are reading &quot;The Tale of Genji.&quot;  It gives you a lot of background and cultural information that will help you understand it.  Also it's great for those who want to learn about a totally different Japan.  It's a definite must read.	2003-09-24

The key figure which holds this book together is William Adams (of Shogun fame).  Adams is an English pilot who finds himself in Japan after a particularly perilous journey.  Being a stranger in a strange land, he faces many difficulties, but through luck and skill in adaptation, he becomes someone of importance in his new home country.  Years later, a group of Englishmen from the East India Company come to set up a factory (trading post).<br />Even though the title of this book is Samurai William, it would be more accurate to describe this book as a history of the East India Company trading post in Japan.  Throughout most of this book, Adams appears only as a supporting character.<br />This book is useful for it's descriptions of Japan in the early 1600's.  It's interesting to read about the reations the English and the Japanese had to each other.  For example, the English reacted to the violence and strict justice in Japanese society, and the Japanese reacted to the uncleanliness of the English.  It's definitely worth reading.	2003-09-18

Unlike his conservative rivals' books, his book is well researched and his preparation pays off again and again in his conflicts with conservative icons.  He points out that the right is going for power at all costs by telling lies and being mean-spirited (which anyone who has seen right-wing media can confirm).<br />This book is utterly a pleasure to read.  Of course it comes down with the hard facts, but it also serves them with some top class comedy.  You won't be able to put it down for a second.  In the changing climate today, I think people are more open-minded about the Bush presidency, and they should really read this book so that they can understand what is going on in the Whitehouse and in the Republican halls of power.  Some of the things that you will learn will have you laughing out loud, but others will just make you shake your head and wonder what this world is coming to.  Check it out.  You won't be disappointed.	2003-09-18

This guide has a complete listing of the books and movies up to &quot;The World is Not Enough.&quot;  It's a light and entertaining read for casual Bond fans or for people who don't know much about the older Bond movies, like myself.  However, I can't imagine that hardcore Bond fans could enjoy this.  Probably those fans know more about Bond than is included in this book.  The listings for the books are about a page each, and for the movies rarely exceeds two pages.  So if you've seen all the movies or read all the books, then I don't recommend it for you.  However, if you'd like to have an introduction into the world of Bond, it's an excellent book.  I thouroughly enjoyed it from cover to cover.	2003-08-09

However these peasants are just reformed opium growers, and it is doubtful whether the boys will be able to learn anything other than other than pain and injustice.  Fortunately, one of the boys has a remarkable talent in storytelling.  This captivates the villiaers who have never seen any kind of modern entertainment.  This gives the boys an opportunity to go to the city to see movies which they must relate to the villiagers on their return.  On their trips they encounter the lovely tailor's daughter.  Also they come across a suitcase full of western books.  These books are banned, but the boys thirst for them, and in reading them, they become aware of a completely different world.  In exploring this different world, they learn some hard lessons in life and love.<br />I have to disagree with the reviewer who disliked the ending.  Perhaps the reviewer wanted to get an ending that vindicated the power of romantic love as set forth in western literature.  However the reviewer must keep in mind that this is not a western book.  And however much you hoped, the ending that you hoped for is not very realistic.  What these boys went through is something that every boy goes through in their life.  This is just an extreme case of growing up.	2003-08-09

The two main characters are Will and Marcus.  Will is a professional at keeping disconnected.  He lives off of the royalties from a song his father wrote.  This has allowed him to live a carefree life of unemployment.  However, there is a dark side to this.

They paint a vivid picture of a China caught between two futures.  Even though there has been great progress in certain things since the Mao era, there are still many things that are terribly wrong with China.  Will progress overcome corruption or vice versa?<br />This book was published in 1994, so many recent developments (Hong Kong's intergration into China, and the spy plane incident for example) are not included.  Despite the age of this book, the commentary on the Chinese government still seems to be accurate.  It provides a window into the government of one of the most important countries in the world.

It really seems to miss the point of foreign travel.  For example, in the section on Taipei there are 23 listings for Western restaurants and only 13 for Chinese restaurants.  Taipei is one of the best cities in the world for Chinese food, and the writer could only manage 13.  This seems terribly unbalanced to me.  To make it worse, some of the western restaurants introduced are Planet Hollywood (yeah, I went to Taipei to get the Hollywood experience), TGI Friday's, McDonald's and Subway (which in the author's own words, \\"needs no introduction\\" -- my point exactly).  I went to Taiwan for the food, so this was a big shortcoming in my point of view.  Another point , he only lists two teahouses and both are in (or near) a museum.  He gives the excuse that teahouses are always closing all the time (of course that didn't stop him from listing a lot of nightclubs).  It just seems like he wasn't interested in researching teahouses.  He just couldn't be bothered.  Also, he writes very little about the excellent night markets.  In fact he devotes an equal amount of space to tell us about food courts.  Come on!<BR>  It's sad, really.  I've used a lot of Lonely Planet guides with good results before, which is why I bought this one without looking at it.  However, I can't recommend this one unless your idea of a good vacation in Taipei is eating at TGI Friday's, having coffee at Starbucks, and going to a club (why are you going to Taipei?  You can do that at home.)  Well, to explain why I gave it two stars instead of one, the transportation and hotel information is useful, so I couldn't bring myself to trash it completely.	2003-02-22

(This books claims to be about Asia, but most of the examples and stories are based in Japan).  Actually, I've been living in Japan for over 6 years, so it's difficult for me to remember what it was like to come to Japan for the first time.  By reading this book, I rediscovered some of my feelings and thoughts that I had at that time.  Putting that aside, that is probably the major flaw of this book.  It comes across as someone spouting off about his trip after his first time in a foreign country.  There are too many generalizations and minor errors for someone who has lived in Japan.  Also his overly-literal translations are just silly.  If you've lived in Japan or have a lot of knowledge about Japan, you're not going to learn anything new.  However, for those who are visiting Japan for the first time, this book will prepare you for your experience.  It's an iteresting introduction to Japan and Japanese society.	2003-01-30

He examines the philosophical root to be exact.  Basically what he says is that Americans are so focused on their rights that they forget about their responsibilities.  he shows how this came about by explaining the way in which the American acedemic community had been influenced by German thought.  According to Bloom this was bad.  Very bad.  Well, to be honest, this book was a little heavy on the philosophy.  Nearly half of the book is a histroy of western philosophical thought with barely a mention of America.  It's interesting, but I don't think that is what the title of the book lead me to believe this book was about.	2003-01-30

This book presents itself as an encyclopedia of the mysteries of the ancient world. First of all, the authors of this book tale a very rational view towards the subject matter.  They present all of the theories for each ancient mystery side-by-side.  When you see them this way, you can start to tell which ones are reasonable and which ones are just pure speculation. To be honest, the authors really dig into and destroy a lot of theories, but when you look at the evidence, you have to agree with the authors.  If you're a true believer type, this book may not be for you, but those who are just interested in an overview of the unsolved mysteries of the ancient world will find this a very informative and interesting book to read.	2003-01-30

Of course Lonely Planet has lots of information about restaurants and hotels, but you can get the tourist information center to help you with hotels and wherever you walk you can find plenty of nice restaurants.  What you really want is a purpose to visit the places that you are visiting.  Lonely Planet just tells you what things are, but this guidebooks tells you the history of each place, so you can understand why each place is important.  If you're looking for a guidebook to tell you where the clubs, hangouts, and youth hostels are, then maybe this isn't the book you're looking for.  However, if you're looking for a nice meaty book to feed you mind on, this is it.	2003-01-19
