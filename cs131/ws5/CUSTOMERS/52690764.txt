Written in the best English childhood storytelling style, this is all quite witty and wicked at the same time.   <br /> <br />Disturbingly wicked at times.  Threatened infanticide, child abuse, and attempted statutory rape are not exactly topics you want to expose younger children or the over-impressionable to.  But face it.  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny would hever reach their potential without good 'ol Count Olaf to spur them along.  He's the villain that too many stories need (including the aforementioned HP) but never get. <br /> <br />At this writing I have not read past the first volume, and I am wondering how thin the subject matter will get by the tenth.  My unfortunate event is now I will have to find out!	2005-02-28
US	52690764	R7IMH8D9TT1Q9	0553803115	677542320	Forty Signs of Rain	Books	4	6	11	N	N	Very savvy	Robinson knows a lot about how the world works and it shows in this story.  He obviously has dealt with venture capitalists and startup companies, Bhuddist monks, Lobbyists, NSF Government grants, senate staff offices, and raising a hyper little kid.   <br /> <br />I agree with some of the other reviewers that this drags a bit.  We really don't need that much text about all the annoying antics of the aforementioned little kid.  The stay-at-home dad parent, Charlie, comes off as some sort of saint.  Personally I would have tossed the brat into the Potomac by page 50. <br /> <br />One other thing, since nobody else seemed to mention it.  The President who appears in the book is obviously George W. Bush, without the name, and his staff and the Congress are obviously the right-wing Republicans of 2004.   When he was writing this Robinson probably figured the Democrats to take a one seat lead in the Senate and narrow the gap in the House to two seats and obviously that didn't happen.   But the story doesn't suffer for it and the authors contempt for the faith-based and lobbyist-based pseudo-science of these characters is made abudantly and eloquently clear. <br /> <br />The short sightedness of this U.S. government really is a problem for our age, even if it can't be pinned on any one set of individuals, and this story takes it on in a real, if fantastic way.	2004-12-24

I think five stars that other reviewers here are handing out are a bit excessive, given the story's flaws.<br />What is best about Traviss's writing is her main character, a police woman who comes off as gruff and cynical as any gothic alchohol-saturated private eye. (Although she doesn't drink.)  Her beat seems to be enforcement of ecological laws in the bleak future of the world.  She expects the worst of people and generally gets it, so what is interesting is what happens when she is plonked down in the midst of an otherworldly colony of vegan eco-fanatics that are sheparded by some sort of super-altrusitic alien.<br />That's where the story breaks down a bit.  The motiviations of the super-alien are recognizable, but unconvincing.  You can cut the author some slack because after all it is an alien we are talking about here but the entire history of the story here is turning about his whim.  That is too small a fulcrum for the size of the lever -- the possible movement at the work-end is too limited.<br />Also, the resolution is a bit too predictable.<br />Perhaps this will be improved in the sequels, so I am looking forward to seeing them.	2004-07-07

She is an \\"Original\\" or one of the \\"Ur-Humans\\" which is close to our kind.  Close as is desirable, since Supras in resurrecting our species added to the basic gene type telepathic abilities and the ability to live several centuries.  It is so hard to latch on to her motivations that the author had to resort to more-extensive-than-necessary explorations of her sexual development.  Her first affair is with a Supra, who dies in an attack that nearly kills Cley as well.  It does kill off her entire tribe and she is the only one left.<br />The rest of the story is about the journey Cley has in the battle against the thing that attacked.  In this she is saved, then abetted, then led by a raccoon-type creature that turns out to be another higher intelligence.  Through all this she is understandably but frustratingly passive, doing little other than surviving while events unfold around her.  Through it all she has obscure and occasionally enlightening conversations with Supras and her raccoon friend, centered around Benford's well-founded ideas of astrophysics, biology, and sociology. <br />Only if you are interested in these topics will you get anything out of this book. I give it four stars because I think Benford rises to much of the challenges of his topic, even though the resulting story will confuse the average reader and leave them unsatisfied.<br />Favorite line: \\"Cley could not help but smile.  `I think I prefer my lust insmaller doses.'\\".	2004-05-31

So far more than a dozen novels and short stories have been wrung out of it with no sign of slowing down. Fans will certainly hope the franchise keeps going. The fact that the founding character Honor Harrington has only a cameo role in Chapter 40 should not stop any fan of the series from thoroughly enjoying this story.  <br />Almost all the characters are flat out fun and the immersion in both global and galactic politics really works to make the story interesting.  The action centers mostly on two young women: Berry, the adopted daughter of a superspy and Ruth, a princess of the Kingdom of Manticore are sent on a quasi-diplomatic mission with Berry impersonating Ruth and vice versa under the supervision of Berry?s father.  The place they are going to is a star system?s whose leader was assassinated and whose alliance with Manticore is shaky. Another superspy who works for Manticore?s enemy is there, along with an ambitious naval officer from the Solarian league.  To add to the fun a cadre of terrorist religious fanatics have designs on the princess and there are ex-slaves that are active in revolt.<br />In short, a lot is going on.  Yet none of it is too hard to follow, particularly if you are up to date on the Honor Harrington series.  The authors are clearly as much interested in pontificating on political philosophy as space-opera action, which puts this on quite a few levels above something like the Star Wars potboilers. They are clearly knowledgeable, which helps, but I can see why some readers find it ?talky.?<br />For this reader a few problems did manifest. Much in the plot depends on the ability of the Berry character (aged only 17) being able to form deep bonds with other characters very quickly. This charm seems a little forced, and is used over and over again to form the basis of alliances that otherwise wouldn?t exist.  Overall, the two girls are justtoo savvy ? at one point mixing it up in lethal action with space marines and at other times ?oh no my dad is going to kill me!? mode when they realize he will find out what they?ve been up to.  Of course that?s fun too.<br />All of it is fun.  Go get it.	2003-11-27

Personally, I would have no interest in a \\"liberal Rush Limbaugh\\" and I doubt any fans of Al Franken would either.<br />This would have been a best-seller even without Fox News' lawsuit for good reason. If you read only one political book this season, this should be it.	2003-09-02

This book is an all-out attack on the right-wing, not conservatives, which is a point that will undoubtedly be lost on most of cable news and talk radio should they dare to take up the topic of _Big Lies._ Conason is always careful with his facts and journalistic integrity, which sets him quite apart from the swarms of right-wing pundits cashing in on their market segment's credulity with endless anti-liberal, anti-Clinton and, ultimately, anti-American diatribes.<br />Many of us who have been regularly reading center and left-of-center publications and web sites for some years now will be familiar with the material covered here.  In fact the acknowledgements include a long list of web sites (\\"blogs,\\" a term I dislike) that seem to herald the importance of this medium in the future.  Conason has packed the most important parts of it into a slim volume, easy to read in just a few sittings, good for busy people who do not have time to read the web.  I did not find a page that failed to deliver something significant. We can just hope it gets into the hands of well-meaning voters who have been duped so long.<br />I am still looking and waiting for a credible debunking, or at least a solid rebuttal, to Joe Conason's and Gene Lyon's _Hunting of the President._  It has been some years now and it has not happened.  My guess is it will not happen with _Big Lies_ either.  Instead you are going to see a lot of shrill denunciations from those who hope to keep the right-wing myth alive with yet more lies, heated adjectives, and spin on trivia. It will be interesting to see what the response will be.	2003-08-17
US	52690764	R1XEMPMKOH19WT	0374125023	937296219	The Clinton Wars	Books	5	99	136	N	Y	Should be required reading for all high-school and above	Blumenthal packs a lot of punch in this summary of American national politics at the end of the century.  For years the right-wing has had its own way in the national media, all the while claiming \\"liberal media\\" over and over again so many times from so many sources that most people believe it.<br />This book doesn't waste much time on that (for the Liberal Media canard, see Eric Alterman's masterpiece).  \\"The Clinton Wars\\" does have to visit the media frequently, because that is where the offensive part of the war took place.  In many cases, as Blumenthal points out, the Clintons were permitted no defense whatsoever.  Reading this story makes you wonder how they survived, even though you know by now how it turned out!<br />If you are turned off by political hate-books (like Coulter, Noonan, Hannity and others) you won't be disappointed by Blumenthal.  If his narrative seems a bit sharp at times, it is only because Clinton's enemies were so hate filled that it seems that even to fully describe them there is no way to not appear partisan.  Blumenthal is always careful to back up his assertions with footnoted facts and direct quotes, and so far I have not found any faking of footnotes of the type that were discovered in Ann Coulter's book.<br />This will all be very unhappy reading for the demographic for whom it is an article of faith that the Clintons are vile, corrupt power-mongers who only \\"got away with it\\" and were never innocent of anything in their lives.  \\"The Clinton Wars\\" takes the trouble to go back in history to explain how this mind-set developed as well, back to FDR's time and before.  History was my least favorite subject in high school, but it wouldn't have been had this book been around.<br />As it is, I'm glad that Blumenthal got this on the record.	2003-05-28
US	52690764	R3GFPS2SHPG4G7	0345447557	291220673	The Speed of Dark	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	A real treat	Elizabeth Moon is one of my favorite authors for her space-opera series, but here she takes a break from that to deliver what turns out to be a surprisingly interesting and entertaining story.  I hadn't thought that I would care all that much about an autistic character, but Moon has obviously carved herself out the task of making people care by way of showing the autistic point of view.  It worked for me.<br />Of course it helps that Lou, her protagonist, is not only a functioning autistic, but a functioning genius as well.  His understated superiority, which manifests to the consternation of the villians and delight of his friends, is quite appealing.  Because of his disability he has to spend a very large portion of his mental effort on simply not being offensive to the &quot;normals&quot; around him.  Anything acerbic he has to say is kept in the narrative and not spoken in the dialog.<br />If the book loses a star it has to be because of the bad guys.  They are simply too one-dimensional to make the challenge of knocking them over anything more than perfunctory.  Perhaps that is OK, because that's not really what the story is about.<br />So go ahead and enjoy it.	2003-04-11

What Alterman has done here is to compile the most significant parts of it into a cohesive narrative, filling in the gaps with well-chosen references.<br />For those that haven't had the time to pay that much attention to it, What Liberal Media should hit them like an avalanche.  There are a lot of people around who have a vague idea that something is wrong with the media when it comes to politics, but still have the illusion that &quot;the Press&quot; (as we are taught in school) is free, and is a liberal guardian of our civil liberties.  Few people can imagine how much the media has been captured by right-wing and conservative interests, but here is irrefutable proof.<br />There is very pointed criticism here of some current icons, including the likes of O'Reilly, Russert, and Matthews.  If you are looking for amusement there it is.<br />This books should be required reading for all undergraduate journalism students.  It should also be required reading for all practicing pundits, who should then be forced to write a rebuttal publically.  I doubt they could without abandoning the facts.	2003-03-11

Afflicted with her own poor decisions she tells how she was swept up in events that landed her in jail and the unwanted media spotlight.<br />There is very little in this book about the Clintons, which is noteworthy in itself.  Even the OIC was forced to conclude that there was no crime partnership between the Clintons and the McDougals, in spite of everything they could do to force Susan McDougal to testify that was the case.<br />The big question has been, which this book is about and answers very well, why did Susan not simply testify the truth as she now tells it to the grand jury, and thereby save herself the better part of two years in jail?  To find out get and read the book.  I was fully convinced.<br />This will be unwelcome reading for the hordes of Clinton-haters who will always be convinced that the Clintons were never exonerated, that they simply \\"got away\\" with it.  The pattern has been so far, as with Conason & Lyons book, as with David Brock's book, as with most other recent books dealing with ultra-conservative perfidy, to simply ignore it as much as possible.  Or perhaps pick nits and find one or two small errors and claim complete fraud thereby.  Don't be fooled, read it for yourself and decide.<br />Politics aside, the story itself is quite compelling.  About half of it has to do with background and events that have nothing to do with Whitewater.  With very little work this could be morphed into a Lifetime-TV-for-women script since it matches the pattern so well.  (Which is, a noble-but-naive woman is afflicted by all sorts of hellish events but comes through in the end older-and-wiser and gets her life together. Unfortuantely most of the bad guys get away in this one.)<br />As I said, a good true-life story.	2003-02-11

In his Coyote future, the Dixiecrats of the 2000's have won complete control at last, and set up a totalitarian regime that names its ships after Jessie Helms and George Wallace.  Although the Northeast and the West have broken away from what was the United States what remains is totally contemptible.  If you are a straight Republican voter you won't like any of this.<br />The male hero, Robert E. Lee, rejects for reasons never fully explained his position of status and privilege to lead a rebellion that steals a starship.  <br />This story is told as a series of somewhat unconnected vignettes, each well written and from varying points of view.  The female central character, Wendy, starts out interesting but never somehow develops.  Her ultimate mate, Carlos, never seems that likable but again his development seems obscure.<br />There's another character that seems to have utterly nothing to do with the story.  He wakes up on the interstellar voyage and incredibly has no way to go back into hibernation.  So he spends the first part of the 230 year voyage wandering the ship and writing a novel until he dies.  Nobody else in the story has any interaction with him other than to read his legacy.  I would have preferred the 5,000 or so words to be devoted to after the exodus and it would have been a better story.<br />There are other loose ends, other unexplained motivations, but those aren't important.  You will have to read this for yourself to see if you end up caring about the characters or not.	2002-12-28

All of them were quite a bit worse for wear, physically or mentally.  <br />The cover has a review quotation that says \\"he reminds us war can be funny as hell.\\"  Combat trauma-induced hallucinations and dementia is funny?  Broken families, psychotic levels of homophobia is funny?  <br />There were a lot of books like this that came out of the Vietnam conflict, and I always wondered if they did a disservice to the majority of veterans that did go there, fight, suffer, and came out without being loony or feeling they were victims.  Not that the minority that were destroyed the way this book describes weren't real; their stories do need to be told but this leaves us with no sense of balance.<br />I suppose it is better than pretending these stories aren't for real, which I guess would be the \\"patriotic\\" thing to do according to some.	2002-12-28

Doctorow, and although he did not grow up in NYC (visited there at times) he says that this novel is a close description of his own experience.  It is about a very peculiar ethnic sub-group, New York jews who are not particularly religious and having &quot;modern&quot; ideas and lifestyle.  To me Doctorow's book is one well-preserved verbal photograph after another.  Somehow he conveys the scenes in a pre-Ektrachrome feeling, where bright colors are rendered in endlessly subtle shades of grey.<br />I hope that when I am Doctorow's age I will be able to summon up the wealth of memory detail he does.  The images are authentically pressed from a the mind of a child not yet 12 years old.  There are things that a child notices that an adult would not, such as how he likes how a particular door latch works or details from favorite comic books.<br />From there the narrative effortlessly moves to other characters in the story, written in the form of letters to the author.  Everything is in place, and all of it wonderful to read.  <br />This should be standard reading for any high school.	2002-11-04

After 9 books in the series you would think that Weber has run out his topic, but here is the story still going strong. Some reviewers thing there isn't enough \\"action\\" but that is not justified. More of the \\"action\\" they crave would just make it a rehash of the earlier books in the series and that is not what this is.<br />It is well understood by now the Weber is drawing much of his inspiration from the C. S. Forester novels (check the acknowledgements). However, it is also clear that Weber is drawing from current events as well. For example:<br />* Evil and hypocritical politicians use sexual innuendo to cynically damage an opponent -- and it turns out that the \\"false\\" rumors have some truth in them that makes them no less unfair?<br />* A weak chief executive wants to isolate the nation and act unilaterally, thereby alienating all the nation's allies, and further bumbles into war that was avoidable?<br />* The elevation of \\"chickenhawks\\" who have no real military experience but many political connections to oversee the operation and budget of the military with disastrous result?<br />My guess is that Weber's politics in real life are centrist. He goes out of his way to make sure it is never the ultra-conservatives or the ultra-liberals that are always in the wrong. Perhaps the best part of Weber's writing is that he has excellent empathy for the \\"bad guy\\" in the story, rarely flattening them out to two dimensions.<br />There are other examples where the story follows real life, but I want to point out a serious flaw that stems from real life. A big part of the story is based on what amounts to selective and malicious alternation of electronic mail.  You would think that empires and republics that have mastered interstellar travel and AI systems would have equally mastered public encryption keys and digital signatures, a technology invented in the 20th century!  Sheesh.  But if you can get around that particular \\"suspension of disbelief, this is a great story.  Well worth following.	2002-11-04

The newer edition is much improved from the new material, but the message is the same.<br />This appears to be a vastly misunderstood work.  I understand that some bookstores stack this in the \\"humor\\" or \\"political humor\\" (if they have one) sections.  That's like placing \\"Animal Farm\\" in the children's section because it has talking pigs and horses.  Personally, I don't find disabilities amusing (Bush's no less than any others) and Miller seems to make it clear he feels the same way.  Also, the joke has been running on too long by this time to be funny.<br />The other mistake is that this is simply an attack by a liberal professor against the conservative Bush president.  Yes, Miller is obviously a liberal and does attack Bush with a near lethal precision of insight and logic -- the kind Peggy Noonan wishes she had -- but \\"Dyslexicon\\" is every bit as much about the rest of us as it is about Bush.  It is about how our superficial media allows a creature such as Bush to exist and even flourish.<br />Regardless of how you feel about the current president Bush, reading Dyslexicon is very instructive in understanding the psychology of others, particularly politicians.  That's a useful skill in this day and age.	2002-09-23

But he exists in a future world, at home with the technological gadgets and hip speech of that age.  And Foster creates a whole new language for this fictional era, and it all hangs together.  Like Burgess' Clockwork Orange but not that mean.  Most of the time you don't have to refer to the glossary to figure out what is meant because the context is so well crafted.<br />There's a murder mystery here that is not too hard to figure out, but twisty enough to keep the story interesting.  If I had been totally surprised at the end I would have given it one more star.  As it is, this is a great book to take to the beach or on an airplane flight.	2002-09-23

With a great deal of insight and nearly zero partisan rhetoric, Judis and Teixeira (how DO you pronounce that?) offer an easy to read political primer about how social and economic cycles fit in with political cycles.  Many political events that were mysterious to me were clearly explained, drawing on historical precedent right up through Election 2000.  I found myself convinced that the authors know what is going to happen next in American politics.<br />The conclusion: the Democratic party will emerge as a new majority by the end of the decade.  The Republicans may or may not retain the House this year, and GWB may or may not win re-election in 2004.  The authors don't pretend to be fortune tellers; instead they chart trends based on comprehensive analysis.<br />The text backs up its logic with lots of figures, sometimes charted.  Part of the book goes state by state for key states and regions, sometimes down to the county level to show what has been (and will be) happening.  Each and every explanation made sense to me, without being too tedious to follow.<br />The only negative thing I can say is to echo something Joe Conason mentioned in Salon.  The authors completely ignore the mainstream media bias against Gore in Election 2000.  However, since that really isn't the topic of this book it doesn't take away from the five stars I give it.	2002-09-02

The star of the show is the SheVa gun (shown on the back cover of the hardcopy version), weighing in at 7,000 tons and 100 meters in length.  It is fueled by a pebble-bed reactor and unfortunately is so big it has a tendency to crush small villages in the way of its present mission.

And lots more weapons systems.<br />The bad guys are aliens, who have mastered interstellar flight but are completely hopeless when it comes to ground battles, where they get waxed over and over again in fights with Americans.  Somehow they can handle powered missiles but not ballistic artillery. They overran the rest of the planet without much problem but the good ol' US of A has what it takes to fight a holding action with kill ratios of thousands to one.  Problem is there are so many of the enemy it is a losing war of attrition.<br />If you can get past the implausibility, you have a setup for plenty of heroism, which is what Ringo is clearly after in this story.  In this kind of story there is no one central protagonist, so you are never really sure who is going to die and who isn't.  The pace is quick and detailed, so it keeps your interest.<br />The story is leavened with plenty of non-violent scenes, to give the \\"human\\" side of events without which we would have nothing but a series of battles.  The non-battle events seem disjointed and almost random, which gives the impression that Ringo is anxious to get that part done and back to the joy of mayhem.  Either that, or there is a sequel in the making.<br />It is clear that Ringo has problems with people who can not (do not) draw a distinction between \\"good nukes\\" and \\"bad nukes.\\"  Ringo makes sure you know the difference, with pointed commentsabout how this or that geographic feature is going to be \\"fertile again, someday\\" even though it is the site of a nuke explosion.  The Chinese, you see, have \\"bad nukes\\" which means the Yangtze valley is going to be contaminated for about 10,000 years, but the \\"good nukes\\" the good guys use can wipe out the enemy at the expense of losing use of the land they were on for just a few years.   (For the record, the science Ringo uses on this point is sound.)<br />As I said, there are plenty of problems with \\"Dances\\" but I'll give it four stars, because when all said and done Ringo tells a good story, making the result better than three stars.  The jacket says he is collaborating with David Weber, who is better at this kind of fiction than Ringo is.  It will be interesting to see what they come up with.	2002-07-29
US	52690764	R2YP0XE6P9ICRO	0743435338	531654219	Diplomatic Immunity	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Bujold has not missed yet with this growing series.	This is the first story in which Miles is married, but it seems he has chosen the right partner.  The whole story I was waiting for him to get in trouble with her, but it never happened.  Even when Ekatrin, wife, gets to meet Bel, \\"old flame.\\"<br />Not that Miles doesn't get in plenty of trouble.  In this case, none of it is his own doing, and Bujold is masterful in unfolding the mystery onion, layer by layer.  His diplomatic mission is not helped by the lug-headed thinking of the military of his own nation, but somehow he prevails.<br />I was worried when the story series made Miles Vorkosigan an \\"Imperial Lord Auditor.\\"  It's an office that carries almost as much power as the Emperor (in some ways more, since he has mobility) so it was hard to see how the character would have any difficulty in overcoming future obstacles.  That turns out not to be a problem.<br />The most notable thing about this series is the rare and good-natured humor that Bujold sprinkles into the story.  Miles is often the butt of the joke, but takes it in stride.  When his wife says, \\"You were an absolute lunatic when you were younger, by all accounts. I'm not sure, if I'd met you back then, whether I'd have been impressed, or horrified.\\"<br />Miles simply says, \\"I'm not sure, either.\\"<br />Well done.  Five stars.	2002-07-29

It it an intriging idea to have a self-aware machine build a self-aware bio-form (the star-child) out of component molecules based on nothing more than an imperfectly understood DNA record.  The part that doesn't sit so well is the resulting person -- with utterly no connection to any human society -- could nonetheless end up with so much culturally in common with people living on a planet.  <br />Hogan also skates over the massive problems that would accrue if you had a person raised in a sterile environment (no bacteria or viruses at all) and plonk them down into a fully functioning Earthlike ecology, even eating the local food.  I'm no expert but I think it would be unlikely that such subjects would survive.  At least not easily.  <br />And if you would be interested in the star-child's first experiences with sex, you will be disappointed.<br />The part of the story about the machines were more believable, actually.  I like the part where they developed multiple personalities to serve different functions: the Scientist, the Skeptic, the Mystic and so on.  <br />Worth reading, but as I said it has shortcomings.	2002-07-10
US	52690764	R3KFAA8O9P7YUV	0812930991	150767402	Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative	Books	5	16	20	N	Y	We already knew most of this; good to have validation	Was he lying THEN or is he lying NOW?  You will have to decide for yourself, but before you do you should do a little homework by reading THE HUNTING OF THE PRESIDENT by Conason and Lyons, FOOLS FOR SCANDAL by Lyons, ONE SCANDALOUS STORY by Kalb, A VAST CONSPIRACY by Toobin, and there are many others.<br />All of them pretty much corroborate Brock's story. I have recently seen conservative pundits try to dismiss Brock out of hand at this point as eagerly as they embraced him when he was cranking out Anita Hill-hating or Clinton-hating material, but their protestations fall pretty flat. The good news is that they aren't going to be able to ignore him.<br />The political significance of this book is what rates it five stars.  In other aspects it is between three and four.<br />In a biographical format Brock is pretty unflinching when he comes to examining his own motivations and mindset.  He isn't the first young idealist to be seduced into a values-shredding cult, nor will he be the last, but his trip in and out of the \\"movement\\" seems a little too clinical for me.  Not that I don't believe it; but I am left to believe that if it weren't for the fact that he was a closeted gay man he would still be there cheerfully rubbing elbows with Ann Coulter and Bernie Goldberg cranking out right-wing hit pieces for the GOP.<br />As it was, he borrows a metaphor to call it \\"being a Jew in Hitler's army.\\"  You don't need to be politically well read to know how the right wing feels about gays.<br />I have to disagree with another reviewer who called Brock's narrative \\"precise.\\"  For this book's next edition, I think it should have more clippings (quotes from Brocks and other hit pieces), dates, and at least an index.  In spite of all that the story is quite understandable, and compelling.  I could not spot any inconsistencies.<br />By his own account, Brock has much to atone for.  This book is a good start, but there is much more to be done.  This story is about how we was in theground floor of a poisionous new trend in presidential politics.  If that is ever going to be undone, the events in this book will have to become common knowledge.	2002-03-15
US	52690764	RUFIL7EMEL7FW	0345435281	796467564	Vitals	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Global Techno Mystery Gone Flat	It's hard to say what's good about this book without writing a spoiler.  Suffice it to say there is a loner-type scientist, who happens to be working on a cure for aging, and happens to have a twin brother that happens to be working on the same thing.  The twin brother dies, and Dr. Hal Cousins spends the rest of the story trying to uncover the global conspiracy that is trying to stop him and murdered his brother.<br />This isn't anything that many bestseller authors like John Le Carre, Tom Clancy, and others have served up for years.  Greg Bear makes it into a technothriller, with an interesting theory about bacteria and how they \\"communicate\\" with each other.<br />Although the characters seem a little underdeveloped, they depth they attain is not out of line for this type of novel.  Even though you learn a fair amount of his history, there is not a lot for the reader to hang onto with regard to Hal.  Then again, there isn't supposed to be.  Nobody gets close to him and his quest is for one man only, aside from an interlude with his brother's widow.  You are supposed to hang on to the mystery and the action, and for the most part Vitals is vital that way.<br />Side note: I used to live a few blocks in Berkeley where some of the action in this story takes place.  That made it sort of fun for me, but not for the average reader.<br />Greg Bear has become an important enough author to make it worthwhile to read this book, even if it doen't become one of your favorites.	2002-02-18
US	52690764	R73PEOJIM2MQJ	0671318489	671131382	Shiva Option	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Space Opera on Steroids	I'll give this book four stars, but only in the acknowledgement that it represents the ultimate of its kind.  If you don't like this kind of fiction, you wouldn't rate this even one star.<br />After all, if you want to follow this story, you are going to have to know and care about the difference between AFHAWK2 from an SRHAWK from an SBMHAWK. Or all sorts of ship classes like MT, BB, GC, a \\"gunboat\\" and so on. Further, you will wade through literally tens of thousands of words about all of these munitions and vessels that will never exist, let alone that ever existed, are used.  If none of this turns you on, you will be bored beyond all imagining.<br />On the other hand, you will be treated to an in depth tactical description of one bloody, desparate space battle after another.  Each one is successively worse than the last, serving up wholesale slaughter that is bloodlessly reported.  The destruction of dozens of large ships, each carrying thousands of crew, most often merit no more than part of a sentence or two.  It is repetitive.  Consider the phrase \\"thousands died, but nothing could have stopped them all\\" (or some slight variation) and that must be repeated at least seven times over the space of 600 pages.<br />When the characters aren't fighting, they are talking about fighting.  (Except for one G-rated post-coital scene.) The plot takes the cheap way out and avoids all possible moral doubt about the war going on.  The enemy, the \\"Bugs,\\" which invoke the artifacts from \\"Starship Troopers,\\" are so alien that they cannot be communicated with and so implacable that there is no option but to destroy them, or be destroyed.  So there is nothing to get in the way of all the fun.<br />As I said, for what it is this is the best you will find.	2002-02-18
US	52690764	R35OCIYBIULUAZ	034540856X	685150972	The Collapsium	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Quite different	This is one of the most original works of SF that I have seen in a while.  Of all the stories that deal with the subject of black holes, I don't think it ever occured to anyone before that they can be mere tools in the hands of humans.  What would that mean for human endeavors and history?<br />McCarthy creates a world where this does happen, and it so happens that a public works project goes awry, the consequence would be the death of the sun!  Oops.  It would be a spoiler to tell you what happens.<br />There are some disturbing aspects to this world that arises from very specualtive technology.  For example, they have &quot;fax&quot; machines that can transmit a human from one place to another, a form of travel.  But the device can also be used to create a complete duplicate of that person.  With memories and everything, the duplicate has no idea that they are not the original.  The problem is that the law is that the duplicate does not have any legal rights whatsoever.  Imagine an enemy being able to steal a copy of you and torture that copy for their own amusement, then dispose of and then go get another.  Would that bother you?  Yikes.<br />Very much worth it.	2002-01-15
US	52690764	R1Q5GPWQNP0BQH	0446529540	552279058	Futureland	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Flawed but compelling work	I think Walter Mosley is one of the top writing talents working today.  It is deceptive how easy he makes it seem, but he draws you into his stories (nine of them in this case) each time with a few spare paragraphs.  Futureland is an example of what all writing students should study, regardless of whether they are interested in the story, to see how he does it.<br />Futureland is not a place anyone would want to live in.  Mosley's vision of the future is not very optimistic, but what I find most depressing is how he always always always makes race the central issue in what is going on.  He is clearly capable of other plot motivaters, but he is so good at sketching racial attitudes and politics his stories fall into black-folk-po-victim-rich-white-folk-is-de-debil themes no matter what.  Mosley socks you in the jaw over and over again with the race conflict.  It gets old.<br />Fortunately, Mosley has a lot more in Futureland than that to think about, so the result is worth reading.  Imagine a civilization with a population so dense that prisons become fully automated, the nonworking population have virtually no civil rights, and rich corporations write all the rules, even to the point that CEOs can style themselves God-on-Earth.  Mosely's characters live in their niches in such a world, sometimes managing to do more than merely survive.<br />At times Futurescape dips into farce and satire, often enough that makes me wonder if that was what the whole story was originally intended to be, or if Mosely changed his mind while writing it.  Perhaps he meant to lighten what otherwise would be a fairly grim text.<br />Four stars.	2002-01-06
US	52690764	R377KVGK9VOESD	0671318608	248449563	The Excalibur Alternative	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Entertaining but predictable	Any fan of David Weber's work will be on familiar ground with this one.  The story follows the same idea of &quot;local boy becomes Emperor&quot; that you will find in Weber's Mutineer's Moon series.<br />Probably the biggest flaw in this book is the central character's uncanny savvy-ness.  A medieval baron simply would not be able to cope with the situation in which Sir George and his wife find themselves in.  It is all just too neat.<br />But if you suspend that bit of disbelief, the story is fun to follow and an easy read, and Weber's superb grasp and ability to explain military situations is delivered once again.<br />So go for it, but not with too high an expectation.  A good way to spend a cross country flight.	2002-01-01
US	52690764	R2AZNRYGYHT83Y	0441008445	639669735	Empty Cities of the Full Moon	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A skull cracker	The story gets intensely wrapped up in its explanation of the universe, much to the detriment of what is really interesting.  At times I was reminded of reading Frank Herbert's &quot;Destination Void&quot; where long passages are devoted to jargon filled essays. The problem in this type of work is that the characters are flattened to two dimensions under the weighty arguments, and the plot becomes nothing more than functional.  <br />The way that Hendirx jumps back and forth over a period of 30 years doesn't help.  It puts quite a demand of concentration on the reader (not necessarily a bad thing).<br />I can't blame him for trying; anyone who loves science and the truly exciting things happening currently in biology and cosmology will appreciate this book.  In spite of the recent (2001) copyright he seems to be a few years out of date with regard to the latest of string theory, but that doesn't matter.<br />Any library of current SF should have this book.	2001-12-29

This story is both heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  You will be surprised to see how fully you will be drawn in.<br />Helice Trust and her two daughters, Chena (age 13) and Teal (age 10), are refugees, with as little personal civil rights as refugees typically have.  Determined to better their condition, Helice applies for and gets admittance to the villages of Pandora.  She is aware that the global government, at odds with the rest of human civilization, has determined that her genetic makeup is nearly perfect to solve a problem they have to solve, and want to use her for biological experiments. In spite of being offered an easy way out (they're willing to pay everything she wants), she will not bear a child for them to be used as a lab rat.  Although we don't get to know Helice that much in this story, she is certainly the moral center.<br />Tam is the remote but protective official who has charge of the village, and he is determined to support Helice in her free choice.  But he may be overmatched by the planet's politics.<br />What fuels this books emotional impact is that Chena and Teal are fully convincing as real sisters.  They love each other, and are capable of annoying each other only as real siblings can.  One moment they are quibbling, the next playing a shared game that they made up.  One of the games is to make up heroic stories about their missing dad, which they indulge in fully aware they are fantasies and not likely to be for real.  Both girls are outgoing and inclined to get in trouble, but are still fully devoted to their mom and accept her corrections without question.  <br />Chena is more than willing to fight for what she wants, even willing to take on a fistfight with a bigger boy her first day on Pandora rather than take an insult, but is then perfectly willing to make friends with the guy's sister.  It's hard not to like someone like that.  Determined todo her part and help her mom, she finds a way to make money in their new home, and eventually ends up in a fight with nearly the whole planet.<br />If this story has a flaw I think that the galactic crisis seems somewhat contrived.  There is really very little explanation or theory why every human colony would go into an irretriveable death spiral, and the proposed solution really makes no sense.  But that is the storm in the ocean; what this story is about is what is going on in the boat.  Well worth reading.	2001-10-30

I went through this book twice looking for something that Chronospace adds to the idea, and the only thing that I could find was a description of how the mechanics of time-travel might work.<br />Steele does his best to develop his characters, but the &quot;chrononauts&quot; seemed a bit stale. Don't look for any romance here.  The designated &quot;primitive,&quot; Dr. Murphy, is somewhat better but a lot that is initiated has no follow up. <br />Favorite line: &quot;It was only slightly less cold than Donna's voice the terrible night she demanded a divorce, ...&quot;	2001-10-13

In this volume McCaffery it seems that tries to include as many characters from prior books as possible, even if all they get is a bit part.  A lot of the plot hinges on the extremely simple-mindedness of &quot;the Abominators,&quot; and it wears quite thin after a chapter or two.<br />In spite of this, I give this book four stars simply for the workmanship, and the clear talent McCaffrey brings to the mix.	2001-07-04

In a slim volume (I read it in two sittings with no problem) Krugman very clearly spells out how the Bush campaign and administration hoodwinked the public into thinking his tax cut was for the middle class.<br />The fact is that 45% of the tax cut goes to the wealthiest 1% of families.  Even \\"working stiffs\\" earning $400,000 per year get it bad. The truth is revealed in the Treasury departments own released numbers (see Table 7 on page 111) which are cleverly packaged in such a way that they SEEM to say the exact opposite.   But Paul Krugman is not fooled, and he explains why you should not be either.<br />Favorite line: (on last page) \\"But there's a special reason to oppose the Bush plan, quite aside from its actual merits or lack thereof. This is the utter dishonesty of the sales campaign. At every stage of the debate Bush and his people have tried to obscure what they were really proposing.\\"<br />For your own good, you must read this book.	2001-06-02

I had not expected to be so much entertained by this book, but I was.  Tomasky goes all the way back to the 1920s to explain how the political situation that made Hillary a senator arose, and he makes it make sense.  Even if you are not that interested in HRC, this book makes a good tutorial of New York politics, its history and psychology.<br />As for Hillary herself, Tomasky makes it seem clear that just about everything you read about her in regular media is wrong. That's not to say that you will like her from reading this, but you will most likely begin to understand (and understand why) your opinion has been built at least partially out of distorted information.<br />My favorite line comes in the prologue: &quot;Hillary has been so reluctant to fill in the blank spaces of her life that people filled them in for her, according to the few clues she dropped along the path, and according to their own ideals and neuroses.&quot; I can't see how you can hit the nail on the head more squarely.<br />How else do you explain the reports of more than a few white, professional women (a demographic that was unexpectedly against Hillary) began spending their $185/hour therapy sessions talking not about themselves, but about Hillary?  <br />More questions: Why did she do so well upstate, where she was not expected to?  Why did she finally get the jewish vote?  Why did she run in the first place?  What happened to change her from such a lousy candidate at the beginning to a winner? Tomasky provides most of the answers, and they probably aren't what you are expecting them to be.<br />Good reading.	2001-05-30

It has enough mystery, action, and adventure to keep you engaged, and the personality is enough to make you care somewhat about the central character, Grant Archer.<br />Now for the romance.  There isn't any.  The story has Grant getting married early on, then the newlyweds are separated for the rest of the story.  The only point of it seems to be to set up some level of continuous frustration, but it somehow seems to be felt by the reader more than by the protaganist.<br />Favorite line: The next few weeks were quickly dubbed &quot;The Wrath of Wo.&quot;	2001-05-27

Unfortunately too many people are going to see this book as a partisan thesis in support of Gore and against Bush.  Although Mr. Bugliosi is clear and up front about the fact that he would prefer Gore to Bush, that is not what &quot;The Betrayal&quot; is about.<br />What Bugliosi does, simply, is put forth with irrefutable logic how the Supreme Court stole the election for their favored candidate.  The evidience is clear from their own self contradictions, lack of support in law, and bizzare conduct, which mainstream media is far too timid and/or superficial to properly report.<br />Most of the content has shown up on The Nation's web page under the title &quot;None Dare Call it Treason,&quot; and this edition fills out the basic text with footnotes.  You can read that if buying this volume is too much of a burden.<br />My favorite line, which is in response to those very confused souls that thought the Florida Supreme Court was trying to steal the election and the noble U.S. Supreme Court merely stopped them, is as follows (paraphrased):   You do not steal an election by wanting all the legal votes counted, which is what the Florida Supreme Court wanted.  You steal an election by stopping the counting of all legal votes, which is exactly what the U.S. Supreme Court did.<br />Tough to get around that kind of logic, although many try.	2001-05-21

He's obviously turned off by GWB and I get the feeling he really doesn't like Gore.  But he does take some time to document both honest Repubs and honest Dems (believe it or not there are some) at the county-government levels of the election machinery.  Reading this, I feel mostly for those isolated individuals that were mostly concerned with doing the right thing, and ended up screwed no matter what they did.  There is a lot of text in this book that says what the players are thinking (as opposed to doing) which gets you closer to the characters but seems out of place in journalism.<br />Tapper documents perdify, misadventure, and out-and-out stupidity on all THREE sides:  Dems, Repubs, and the media.  For whatever reason the media clearly ended up influencing the events in favor of the Republicans, and had they not the result might have been quite different.<br />The fact is that the GOP simply out-manuvered the Dems all though the campaign, and right through the post-election mess.  If you want to see how they did it, this book is a good view into it.  A must-read for anyone to be informed on contemporary politics.	2001-05-06

What this book is mostly is the author's recipies (disguised as the aliens) formula's for the world's ills: domestic abuse, overpopulation, women's rights, and the drug war.  Heinlien and others have always done this unabashadley, mixing in their own politics in hefty doses.  Sheris S. Tepper continues this tradition in bulldozer fashion.<br />What saves &quot;The Fresco&quot; is that it turns out to be a pretty good story; delivering the right amount of action and interaction with a bit of resonable theological speculation and debate.  Don't look for space opera here.<br />PS: Although never mentioned by name, two of the active characters in this book are Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton. (Always referred to as &quot;the president&quot; and &quot;the FL.&quot;) There are other current political characters modeled under different names, although interestingly enough Ken Starr is mentioned under his own name.  If you happen to be a Clinton-hater, you probably won't like the politics in this book.	2001-04-08

And there are many things you need to know other than who pulled the trigger.<br />The Ripley character is fascinating in some ways since you can get in his head sometimes, but that doesn't let you know why he does what he does.

If you have a logical mind Flanagan will teach you not only Java but some good basics for object-oriented programming techniques.<br />What impressed me most was his ability to understand what a C++ programmer would be going through to learn Java, and he writes with that in mind. Just one example: in Java the &quot;+&quot; operator has a special meaning for the &quot;String&quot; object.  In C++, this is just an overloaded operator commonly used the way Java uses it.  A less astute author would have neglected to point out this difference (and why it is that way) and as a result I would have wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how the String class implemented the &quot;+&quot; operator.  I could cite a bunch of other examples of this, but you will no doubt find them for yourself.<br />This definitely should be on your bookshelf if you are doing anything with Java.	2000-12-22

Esmay Suiza has finally grown out of her victim-character (that's a relief), and we get to see more of Heris Seranno in action.  Even Lady Cecelia gets to have a good whack at the bad guys again.<br />Don't start the series with this book; go back to the beginning and read them all.  You're in for a treat if you do.  Along with Weber's Honor Harrington series, this is the best space-opera currently running.	2000-12-06

This is a rich and complex trilogy about an Earth girl who is swept up into the politics of a vastly powerful space-faring family.  The author appears to understand hard science better than most SF authors, and she uses it judiciously.  It is a shame this is out of print; it clearly deserves more recognition than it ever got.	2000-10-16

Hypers are not necessarily outlaws, but Dana, a hyper with his  own starship, ekes out a marginal living by smuggling.  He picks the wrong  cargo, and falls into the hands of a ruthless slaver named Zed Yago.  Zed  is also a sexual sadist that satisfies himself with Dana before giving him  (&quot;I don't own slaves&quot;) to his sister.  The planet they live on is  one big desert (see Dune) that has an economy based on legal  slavery.<br />Lynn makes no apologies for this, or anything else that happens  to Dana.  Dana spends very little time feeling sorry for himself, and of  course the story is about his attempts to escape this fix.<br />It is also  more about sexual expression in a setting that allows exploration that  would not be plausible in a less extreme setting.  Although I felt that  Lynn could have gone deeper into this, perhaps she arrived at a better  balance between action and introspection than I would have.  Good fun, in  any case.	2000-04-30

If you have been following this series you will have to read this one (kind  of like the second Dune book) but don't expect much satisfaction out of  it.<br />Ms. Moon, if you're reading this take your time on the next one.   We'll still be here.	2000-01-16

The rest is a great presentation of where string theory is up to 1999.  I would have liked to see more equations, (about the only math in  the book are in the footnotes, and those are well-known formulas) but  Greene is clearly wary of frightening the average bookstore browser off.   It is also possible (he does mention this) that the math is so complicated  that there is no way to provide a cohesive introduction.  Still, I would  very much recommend this book to anyone who is the slightest bit interest.	1999-10-16

VHDL is hard learn and Perry managed to get me through to my first model.  However, this book has a lot of problems as a reference work.  As a tutorial, it is OK, but there are often concepts  that are used but never defined.  For example, nowhere in the book is there  a list of primitive operators for VHDL!  Still, what he does explain well  is what each individual language concept is use for.  That is what makes it  for this book.	1999-06-04

For the first time in this series, however, her lead character seems to have gone astray.  We pick up Esmay Suiza where she  left off in _Once a Hero_.  Only by being totally dense does she get in  trouble again, even managing to alienate the only lover she's ever had.   What saves it (the novel, not the heroine) is Moon's talent for somehow  weaving the most inexplicably incongruous topics into science fiction.   This time something called &quot;The Texas Rangers&quot; are the bad guys.   Good fun but damn if I don't want to knock some sense into the heads of the  main characters.	1999-02-01
