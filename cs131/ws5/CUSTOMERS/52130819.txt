The book is so dense in its ideas and characterizations that a little simply went a long way. Don't get me wrong: I found Clarke's writing superb and her imagination on par with J.K. Rowling's (and for me that's saying a lot); but I kept losing patience with the book as a whole.  It went on and on and didn't seem to be going anywhere.  Finally, having read the last half on an extended vacation, I have to say that this is, all things considered, an extraordinary novel.  All great works of literature introduce us to characters we come to care a great deal about, characters who transcend the page and become as real to us as ourselves; and they make us either see our own world in new ways or introduce us to worlds we couldn't possibly imagine.  \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" works remarkably well on all counts.  Norell, Strange, Childermass et al. are all beautifully realized characters, and the world Clarke has them inhabit is both familiar and extraordinarily, delightfully new.  As long as you don't let the length of the book deter you, and you can give in to the richness of its wonders, you'll be in for a helluva ride.  Trust me -- and Clarke: all the disparate, seemingly unrelated strands come together in the poignant, bittersweet finale.	2005-09-05

I thought that George was back in top form with her latest mystery, \\"With No One As Witness,\\" until right before the end when...well, I guess you know already that a major character dies.  (A minor major character, as far as I'm concerned, and not the one I would have picked, but that's just me.) Don't get me wrong.  I have absolutely nothing against killing off a character.  I think it can invigorate a series -- and God knows this one needed invigorating.  But the thing that really suprised -- and annoyed -- me is that George seemed to do the dirty deed to deflect us from the fact that she had no interesting or twisty way to wrap up the actual case that takes up almost the entire book.  When the killer is revealed, he/she turns out to be one of the four or five people Lynley and Havers have suspected all along.  So, where's the payoff?  OK, you think, it's that person as opposed to one of the others.  So what?  It's a remarkably weak, perfunctory denouement.  And one that certainly can't compete with the vicious, distasteful, undignified death George has in store for...whomever.  (I'm certainly not going to tell.)  Ultimately, with such a disappointing ending, I can hardly recommend this as one of George's best.	2005-08-29

(Theory/Spoiler Attached)	OK, that's a little harsh.  But I'm not really sure that the identity -- let alone the existence -- of the Half-Blood Prince has ANYTHING to do with...well, anything.  Rowling could have exised the whole sub-plot of the Prince and the story would not have changed one iota.  I was expecting the identity of the Prince to be a mystery that, when revealed, would unlock the key to Book 6.  Instead, it comes quickly at the end, not from Harry figuring anything out, but by the Prince simply exposing himself.  And, unfortunately, it was pretty obvious who he was going to turn out to be anyway.  I miss the mysteries and events that have propelled previous books: Who's trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone?; What is the Chamber of Secrets, and who has opened it?; Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban; The Tri-Wizard Tournament. There was no prevailing \\"event\\" to Book 5, which, as far as I'm concerned, should have been called \\"Harry Potter and the Lost Prophecy\\" in keeping with what the book was actually about. And there is certainly no prevailing \\"event\\" to Book 6, which should have been called \\"Harry Potter and the --\\"  Well, I don't know, cause I'm not sure WHAT it's about.<br /><br />That's not to say there aren't some wonderful moments in the book.  Rowling's characters and vibrant imagination are always pleasurable company, even as things in her world have become much, much darker.  Chapter One is vintage Rowling (very amusing), and there's a revelation about the Defense Against the Dark Arts position that will send chills down your spine.  The scene in which Harry obtains Slughorn's true memory is poignantly bittersweet, and the \\"horcrux\\" is a thrilling new invention and challenge for Harry.  But I cannot wrap my head around the book's finale.  Not the shocking death, which was probably inevitable, but Snape's betrayal.  Having set it up in Chapter 2, I was sure Rowling would have spun it somehow NOT to be true.<br /><br />My theory is this: That it was Dumbledore (having taken Polyjuice Potion) that made the Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa Malfoy.  (Hence the burnt hand he tells Harry he received while locating a horcrux.)  And in agreeing to fulfill Draco's task should he be unable to do so, Dumbledore is, in a sense, agreeing to commit suicide.  So this is what Hagrid overhears Snape and Dumbledore arguing about: Dumbledore (being a marked man either way) has enlisted Snape to kill him should he convince Draco not to -- and that's exactly what takes place on top of the astronomy tower.Potion) that made the Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa Malfoy.

Banks himself continues to be an interesting character, and Robinson's writing is never less than superb, but this particular mystery was a big \\"who cares?\\" for me.  The mystery itself isn't really much of a mystery and its solution has more to do with blind luck and a piece of evidence that just happens to appear, like a deus ex machina at the last moment, than it does with any brilliant deduction on Banks's part.  \\"Innocent Graves\\" seems far more interested in the psychology of the suspects (one in particular, whose story concludes in an all too predictable fashion) than in satisfying its readers with a great solution to the crime.  I've always found this kind of mystery a bit of a bore; give me a couple of corpses and some brilliant twists and I'm happy.  There are a couple of corpses here, but no twist; just a far too unbelievable and uninteresting ending.	2005-02-20

In fact, if I'm not mistaken, this was her first mystery, period.  And it's surprisingly dull, as far as I'm concerned.  The \\"shocking\\" conclusion to me was obvious from the first few chapters -- I can't tell you why without giving it away -- and now, 30 years later, not so shocking.  In fact, by today's standards, it's pretty tame, even quaint.  The caliber of Rendell's work soars with her next mystery \\"Wolf to the Slaughter\\" and from there she just gets better and better.  But this first effort didn't do it for me.  Don't base your opinion of Rendell on this book -- unless you love it, of course! -- but do check out the rest of the Wexford mysteries, which are sublimely written and -- yes, truly -- shocking in their conclusions!	2005-01-11

Of course I started with the first of the Inspector Banks series and was surprised to find no similarity to the Rankin books at all.  The Robinson novel was a modern variation of the cozy English village police procedural made famous by so many other writers.  Where was the grit of Rankin, the complicated psychology?  Well here it is, finally, in Robinson's sixth Banks mystery, recently reissued.  This is a fine piece of work, masterfully written, with a truly surprising ending.  Now I know why reviewers have mentioned Rankin (a must read) and Robinson in the same breath.  And I'll definitely be reading more.	2004-11-22

I've recently started reading the Christie mysteries I've missed along the way, including this, her second full-length Poirot.  I found it tough going at times, somewhat confusing...but I've rarely been so blown away by the denouement of a whodunit!  I can only imagine that this was the book that cemented Christie's reputation after her debut with \\"The Mysterious Affair At Styles.\\"  Sure, the writing is old-fashioned (it was written in the late 20s, after all), but the intricacies of the plot and the way Christie keeps you off-base and guessing until the very end are simply stunning.  You may not have heard of this Christie (it was new to me), but it truly ranks up there with \\"...Roger Ackroyd\\" and \\"...the Orient Express\\" for sheer suprise value.	2004-11-02

Call me a spoil-sport, but that issue with the dates REALLY bothered me as well.  It's a very sloppy mistake which seems to epitomize how I felt about this book.  It's clever at times, but Dorcas (the narrator) goes from being a funny, irreverent sage to an out-and-out pill awfully fast and Willett's narrative style is wildly inconsistent.  Literary and thoughtful at times, a messy spew of words the next.  And that date mistake.  How does a writer do such a thing?  How does an editor not catch it?  It only indicates that no-one involved in the writing or publishing of this book cared enough or took enough time with it.  So why should I or any other reader?	2004-10-08

OK, so the authors are no Dan Brown -- but Brown is hardly Tolstoy, is he?  The intellectual thriller is a disposable genre to begin with, and as such, \\"The Rule of Four\\" is a terrific example of what makes it so much fun.  No, its protagonists aren't globe-trotting academes with the police and/or international cartels nipping at their heels.  They're Princeton seniors, working on a 500-year old Renaissance -- well, you know all this already.  For my money, Caldwell and Thomasen have written (and beautifully, at that) an engrossing, taut -- albeit subdued -- first novel, extremely literate and  stimulating.  Is it the most brilliant, exciting book ever written?  Of course not, but then -- be honest, folks --neither is \\"DaVinci Code.\\"  I enjoyed \\"Rule of Four\\" tremendously, and while I wasn't blown away, I was not for one minute bored.	2004-08-08

(At the same time, does anyone really know what pittosporum and eugenia shrubs look like?) There are some wonderful scenes (particularly a seduction over mac-and-cheese that's pretty hot -- and beautifully written) and vivid characters -- but it doesn't add up to much.  Perhaps the problem is mine, that I've graduated to Michael Connelly and Ian Rankin, whose twisty, fast-paced, grittier works mooooove.

But when a compelling, beautifully written biography like Edmund Morris's \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" or Antonia Fraser's \\"Marie Antoniette\\" comes along, I devour it happily.  I did not find Robert Asprey's \\"The Rise of Napoleon\\" to be that kind of book at all.  This is a military history, first and foremost.  If you want to know (and can keep track of) every move of every division of every army in which Napoleon ever fought, or fought against, this book is for you.  I wanted much more personal information, much more about the inner thoughts of the man and what might have made him tick.  Nor does Asprey do much towards explaining the world in which Napoleon lived or the political forces that made him what he became.  Honestly, I couldn't finish this first volume, and will certainly not go on to read the second.	2004-06-08

(SPOILER ENCLOSED)	A middling Donna Leon mystery is better than just about anyone else's best, but I must say that \\"Uniform Justice\\" left me quite disappointed.  The actual whodunit side of her novels has never been Leon's strong suit; instead she excels at creating atmosphere, and her characterizations are marvelous.  (Brunetti and Signorina Elettra are two of my favorite mystery characters ever.)  In \\"Uniform Justice,\\" however, the mystery is perfunctory at best.  We all know that the young Moro didn't kill himself, and by mid-book we pretty much know why (if not by whom) he was killed.  When we do find out, it's not that much of a suprise, nor is much done about it.  Perhaps this is an aspect of the Leon mysteries that is beginning to wear thin for me: the Italian judicial system is so rife with corruption that rarely are the killers brought to justice.  All her books seem end the same way, with no-one being punished, nothing being accomplished by Brunetti's investigation.  So what's the point?  Part of the satisfaction of crime novels is the pleasure of seeing the wicked punished.  When they never are, it leaves me, as a reader, feeling that the whole enterprise was something of a waste of time.  With each new Leon novel, I resign myself to the fact that no matter whodunit, it won't really matter.  So from page one my expectations are low.  I would love to experience, just once, the \\"wow\\" I feel at the end of a Michael Connelly or Magdalen Nabb mystery.  Leon seems to be in a formulaic rut.  I suppose it's proven successful for her -- but not necessarily for me.	2004-05-21

This is one of his Kenzie/Gennaro mysteries.  They're darker (if you can believe it), pulpier, extremely violent, but highly readable page-turners.  I have to admit that, for me, all the killing (psychotic torture, in this one) became more than a bit wearing, and ultimately produced an \\"oh,come on -- enough already\\" attitude on my part.  I guess serial killers really do exist, but the plot of \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\" ended up being just a bit too ridiculously unbelievable.  And I'm beginning to sour on Pat and Angela, whose ethics are, at best, questionable. (Are all cops and PIs in Boston truly this cavalier about justice and the worth of human life -- even the bad guys' lives? And if their good pal and psycho bodyguard Bubba is comic relief, I guess I have no sense of humor.) Lastly, the main villain's identity was pretty clear from mid-book.  All-in-all, in \\"Darkness\\" Lehane seems to be trying to muscle in on Hannibal Lecter territory, with limited success.  It's a good disposable read, but one that's highly flawed.	2003-12-28

I know that the introduction of characters and the analyses of their daily lives and inner struggles is meant to serve as so many red herrings, but too often George just comes across as enamored of her own voice.  And when the denoument is as pedestrian (and predictable) as it is here, I for one resent how long it's taken to get there.  Add a cast of characters that range from grating (the hippie-dippy Californians) to downright unpleasant (Adrian's abrasive mother) and two detectives (not George's usual pair) whose romantic moaning and groaning are tedious at best...and you have sub-par George.  But George nonetheless.	2003-11-13

He's a writer's pretentious idea of what a deep, troubled intellectual must be like.  I kept waiting for Carrie to slap him and tell him to get over himself, but no such luck.  Mike, for all his confinement, is the most active person in the book.  Ultimately this is nothing more than a plain, old-fashioned Harlequin-type \\"women's novel,\\" tarted up as literature.

Huge clues (like shoe boxes full of cash) are dropped into the story and then ignored by our heroine Alexandra Cooper and her wise-cracking sidekick, Det. Chapman. The plot twist that propels this tired tale to its conclusion doesn't pop up until page 300 of the paperback addition, and by that time you probably won't give a hoot whodunit or why.  (Besides, it's patently absurd.)  I did find the historical information on Blackwell's Island fascinating (hence the two stars), but again, Fairstein has no idea what to do with it.  And isn't it strange that in four books, we've never met anyone in Alex's family?  The poor woman seems to spend every holiday alone!  Worst of all, the \\"thing\\" that the murderer is killing everyone to get his/her hands on is never even found.  Whatever happened to a writer wrapping up her plotlines?

There are 9 more books to go, so I'm not sure that Grafton has time to reinvent herself (and Milhone), and honestly I'm not sure that I would want her to do so.  After all, the Patricia Cromwell books took a serious dive when Scarpetta went from being a local medical examiner to trying to save the world single-handedly.  But some imagination and invention is clearly needed.  There is still good writing and humor here (hence the 3 stars), but continuing with a beloved series should be a pleasure, not a tedious obligation.	2003-03-21

The letdown of the ending doesn't quite justify the book's length, which is padded with too many scenes of Alexandra Cooper (the feisty prosecutor heroine) lecturing -- and I do mean lecturing -- at various posh affairs about the prevelance of sexual crime in our times.  Not an unimportant message, but not one that we need to hear over and over.  Still, Fairstein writes relatively well, and the book is never boring.  I just wish it had had the type of surprise ending that her first book had.  After all, isn't that why we read mysteries in the first place?	2003-03-20

In one of Martha Grimes's most recent books, a mystery writer complains about how she's become shackled to her fictional detective series to the degree that she'd be laughed at if she wrote &quot;serious&quot; fiction.  Well, if Grimes herself is having the same kind of identity crisis, and this is the kind of &quot;serious&quot; fiction for which she wants to be known, then I'd rather she stop writing altogether.  It won't be that great a stretch, as &quot;The Grave Maurice&quot; is hardly &quot;writing&quot; at all.  It's some plotting, some character description and a lot of pontificating -- but it's not much of a book.  I would say it's not up to Grimes's usual standards, but unfortunately, as her usual standards have plummeted in the past few years, this is sadly par for the course.  So many of the once great mystery series out there (this one, Sue Grafton's Alphabet Series, Janet Evanovich's once-hilarious Stephanie Plum novels,  most particulary Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta books -- even the great P.D.James's latest) have taken on a stale, musty been-there-done-that, send-me-the royalty-checks quality.  Writers do nothing more than insult the intelligence of loyal fans when they churn out chewed-over, by-the-numbers tripe.  If you have nothing to say, ladies, don't say it.  (And that goes for James Patterson and any number of male mystery authors who could never put two words together in the first place.)  My apologies, folks, for the over-hyphenated (there I go again!) diatribe.  I guess I'm just madder about wasting my time than I'd thought.	2003-03-07

No-one is as good as she at dropping bombshells (in this case, practically at the end of each chapter) which completely send the story in opposite directions to where the reader thought it was going.  George always keeps you on your toes, at no time in her career so brilliantly and masterfully as she does here. Could \\"Traitor\\" have been shorter?  Of course.  But I loved losing myself in the vastness and complexity of the plot.  To be fair, I have found George dull and a little too enamored of her own voice at times, but surprisingly not in this, her lengthiest book.  Start it, stick with it, you won't be sorry you did.	2003-02-04

Morgan's analysis and explanation of what caused the American Revolution is step-by-step crystal clear, beautifully written and spelled out.  As a primer on the Revolutionary War and it's genesis (at least from Franklin's point of view), I can't imagine any book topping this one.  As a definitive biography of Franklin -- again, I'm no expert -- it seems a bit lacking.  Morgan has purposefully kept things short, and repeatedly qualifies that if there's not much in the book about Franklin's day to day life, it's because not much exists in the historical record.  Fair enough, but one gets the sense that with a bit more effort, Franklin's story could have been fleshed out better.  Regardless, this is a terrific read, informative and very entertaining.  So glad I got it.	2002-11-15

How surprised I was to discover just the opposite.  Ambrose may have been a great historian, but he was no writer.  Incidents that in the series were presented with drama and suspense were written of in a flat-footed, perfunctory manner.  What I came away with most after reading &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; was less respect for Ambrose and more for the producers and writers of the series, who so successfully fleshed out Ambrose's skeletal text.  I don't think I've ever said this before, but skip the book and rent the movie.	2002-10-29

A bit cut and dry, the book manages to hold your attention without sparking much excitement. There's not much gossip here -- and what there is seems warmed-over (probably culled from other sources) and is presented in a leaden, flat-footed manner. There's none of the juice and (more importantly) the wit of Manuela Hoelterhoff's delicious \\"Cinderella & Co.\\" Your time might be better spent re-reading that (or, better yet, discovering it for the first time) than slogging through \\"Molto Agitato.\\" The main problem is Fiedler's poor writing skills. Some examples:<br /><br />- While discussing German artists fired during World War I she states that artists such as \\"...Melanie Kurt, Margaret Ober [and others were replaced by] the French conductor Pierre Monteux and Roberto Moranzoni, an Italian conductor.\\" Huh? Female singers were replaced by French and Italian conductors?<br /><br />- Fiedler states that \\"In the fall of 1968, two extraordinary singers made their Metropolitan Opera debuts, only weeks apart. No one could have known then that Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti would go on to define opera for the next quarter-century.\\" Only two pages later she writes \\"...two singers joined the Met roster in 1968 who, thirty years later, would still be singing and selling out the theater...Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo...\\" Sloppy, unnecessary repetition.<br /><br />- She refers on one page to \\"Cosi fan Tutte\\" (on the assumption that her readers are familiar with the piece) and then on the next to Mozart's \\"Cosi fan Tutte\\" (as if they've never heard of it!) Again, inexcusable sloppiness.<br /><br />And the examples go on and on. What's up here? This is a major, not inexpensive Doubleday publication. Where were Fiedler's editors? Whole chapters -- like the one entitled \\"Star Power\\" -- come out of nowhere and lead nowhere, seemingly just plopped into place without the slightest forethought.<br /><br />All in all, there is a rushed, routine feel to \\"Molto Agitato\\" that prevents it from being the truly valuable history that I'm sure Fiedler thought she was writing.l in all, there is a rushed, routine feel to \\"Molto Agitato\\" that prevents it from being the truly valuable history that I'm sure Fiedler thought she was writing.	2002-09-25

Malone, speaking in whomever's voice, is still head and shoulders above 95% of every other mystery/humor writer out there. His ear for dialogue never fails, his plotting is always taut.  All three of the Justin/Cuddy books are literate, twisty, witty -- just plain great.  Start with the first (\\"Uncivil Seasons\\") because there are characters and history there that will make \\"Time's Witness\\" (wow, what a book!!) and \\"First Lady\\" resonate all the more.  Why Malone isn't as successful as Grisham is beyond me.  He's only 100 times better.	2002-09-12

I love his voice, his take on life, his ability to find humor in even the most bleak of circumstances. &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Straight Man&quot; are two of the most consistently funny books I've ever read. I approached &quot;Empire Falls&quot; with great anticipation, especially after it won the Pulitzer. Having just finished it, I have to say that I found it less successful than its two predecessors. Ultimately, there seems to me to be a lack of consistancy in its tone and focus. Whereas Miles is definitely meant to be the main character, we spend too much time in other people's heads. For the most part Russo is right on (more than right on) in his depictions of these people. His characterization of Janine is so insightful, and Cindy Whiting's final speech to Miles is brilliantly to the point. Russo nails the human condition far better than most writers out there, and he does it in consistently disarming ways. The flashbacks are lovely, and there is heart and an emotional richness in this book that are missing from his previous works. (I've read everything but &quot;The Risk Pool.&quot;) But Miles is as frustrating for the reader (this reader, at least) as he is for so many of the other characters. Ultimately, somehow, somewhere &quot;Empire Falls&quot; goes just a bit off track, enough to make me, at least, a little puzzled by it. I found the ending both inevitable and unsatisfying, almost as if Russo had boxed himself into a corner and didn't know where to go. A lot seems unresolved, but perhaps that's the author's point...so much in life is just that. Look, if you like Russo you must read this. But a friend who didn't know his work found &quot;Empire Falls&quot; just too long and pointless. I can't say I'm completely surprised, but at the same time, there's enough in there that makes you glad to have someone like Russo around to champion the underdog, the Everyman, and make you think about life and its complexities in a fresh way.fresh way.	2002-08-21

In fact, there is a scene halfway through the book (a phone call between a priest and a music teacher) that is one of the most moving I have ever read in any piece of fiction.  There is more about the human condition and Man's need for artistic sustenance in those few pages than in most complete works of literature.

Okay, so maybe it's not fair for me to judge this book, seeing as how I'm only on page 60-something -- but I'm a huge Stephanie Plum fan, and already \\"Hard Eight\\" is a major disappointment. I can hardly believe this latest adventure is written by the same Janet Evanovich whose previous books were so hilarious, irreverent, raunchy, and just plain laugh-out-loud wonderful. This honestly reads like some college student in a mystery writing class who's decided, \\"Oh, I can do that\\" -- and can't. The humor (such as it is) is terribly labored (the running gags have officially run out of steam) and the prose is endlessly repetitive, clunky and -- what's most shocking for an Evanovich book -- boooring.  If I finish \\"Hard Eight\\" it will be in the spirit in which Ms. Evanovich seems to have written it: as a not particularly pleasant chore because she had nothing better to do -- or a publisher's deadline.  Only for the most undiscriminating reader.	2002-07-25

Iain Pears is two writers: One writes breezy, funny, ingenious &quot;Art History&quot; mysteries (whose main character is Art expert Jonathan Argyll), and the other writes...well, dull, intellectual exercises such as &quot;The Dream of Scipio.&quot;  Don't get me wrong, I admired this book for its scope, and Pears should be lauded for his ambitions.  I just lose patience with him as an author when he writes &quot;important&quot; fiction.  Because this novel is fairly dripping with &quot;importance&quot; -- or more to the point &quot;self-importance.&quot;  As you can guess, I was no great fan of &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost.&quot;  The impenetrable quality of that title gives you an idea of the type of writing we're dealing with.  Pears certainly knows his History, but never -- in either the previous book or this one -- creates characters that are more than one-dimensional.  Their loves, their betrayals...who cares.  As I said, there's much to admire in &quot;The Dream of Scipio&quot; and it's, for the most part, interesting -- there's just not a helluva lot to enjoy.	2002-07-17

I, for one, have not embraced the increasingly high-tech nature of McCone's practice over the years, so it was good to see her relying more this time around on good old-fashioned leg-work.

There are so many great books out there to discover (not just mysteries, but fiction, biographies etc.) that I can't justify spending time on a story of so little substance.  To be fair, Hess's books have never been much more than trifles, fun ways to waste some time.  But really, enough is enough.  What was once fun has now become tiresome, each book nothing more than a retread of the one before.  And the mysteries themselves (the actual whodunit aspect of these whodunits) have never been their raison d'etre.  So I'm just not going to bother anymore.  Sorry, Joan, but P.D.

Honestly, I've been unimpressed by the past four or five Kinsey Millhone books.  Grafton has been slipping into lackluster formula, putting her heroine into less-than-gripping situations, the outcome of which I haven't given a hoot about.  But with &quot;P is for Peril,&quot; she's back in top form, with not one, but two intriguing plotlines.  Reading this book, you know why this series is consistantly on every best-seller list.  By the denouement (on the last page, no less!), I had re-discovered why I became a Millhone fan in the first place.  Brava!	2002-01-31

Around page 200 she complains frustratedly that she's spinning her wheels, that the case is going nowhere. I could relate. \\"When is something going to happen, here?\\" I was thinking. Finally Judith comes across some information that turns things around, and from then on the book flies by fairly quickly. (With a great jolt of a twist on page 298!) But, honestly, the first 200 pages are trying, especially when you realize (I hope I'm not giving away too much here) that they have NOTHING to do with the outcome of the mystery. Still, the 3 stars are for Isaacs deft writing, her wry one-liners. I won't say \\"Long Time No See\\" is a waste of time, but if there's a Number Three, I won't be buying the hard cover. That's what libraries are for, you know?	2002-01-18

I was surprised at the clumsiness of some of Isaac's plotting.  I mean, even if I hadn't seen the film, the culprit is pretty darned obvious.  And my affections for the heroine, Judith Singer, were severly tested by her carrying on with Lt. Sharpe (a complication Isaacs wisely dropped from her screenplay of the book).  On the other hand, I was delighted by the author's sparkling wit and delightfully wicked insights, something I recalled from the hilarious screenplay.  The comic elegance of the writing is the real reason to read &quot;Compromising Positions.&quot;  Isaacs is no Elizabeth George or P.D. James, but of the &quot;lighter&quot; mystery writers, she has few equals.	2002-01-11

Agatha Ludlum?	&quot;Unsolicited,&quot; billed as a Booklover's Mystery is a bit of a mystery itself. From its setting, the world of London publishing, one might expect a cozy British whodunit. Instead, we get a mini-thriller about international intrigue during World War II, something that might have been penned by Agatha Christie and Robert Ludlam's love child.  It's not always (if ever) an easy mix.  One wishes that Kaewert were less ambitious.  Her main character, Alex Plumtree, is an affable fellow, but we never quite believe the situations in which she places him.  Perhaps if she were a better writer (an Elizabeth George, for instance), she could pull off the &quot;ordinary man in extraordinary situations&quot; scenario, but she simply is not.  Two other points: The truly vicious feud that Plumtree has with his crack-head brother leaves an unpleasant aftertaste (where can it possibly go in further books?); and Alex's lascivious salivating over the woman he loves unrequitedly is never worthy of an English gentleman. I suppose I shouldn't criticize &quot;Unsolicited&quot; for what it isn't; I just wish I enjoyed what it is a little bit more.	2001-11-05

I know that I'm in quite a minority, but on re-reading &quot;The Fellowship...&quot; in anticipation for the film, I'm finding it quite dull.  (And I'm someone who loved &quot;War and Peace.&quot;)  Don't get me wrong: the story of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is fantastic, and Tolkien has my undying admiration for the magical world he has created.  But his writing is not -- to me -- particularly interesting.  There are far too many topographical passages, along the lines of &quot;Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys.&quot;  And then there are the historical passages: &quot;Under [the mountains] lies Khazad-dum, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit...Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil and Bundudshathur...between their arms lies the deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimril Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion.&quot;  And on and on and on.  Sorry, folks, but I can't get into it.  If that makes me a philistine, so be it.

This is the first of her books that I've read, and she was indeed a splendid writer. But the mark of any good mystery author (as far as I'm concerned) is the ability to dazzle the audience with the denouement, usually at the hands of the brilliant amateur or professional sleuth who's trying to solve the case.  Tey's Detective Grant seems remarkably able at the start of the book to pull together loose strands of information and reach those impressive conclusions that readers expect from fictional detectives.  But the actual solution of the whodunit is literally handed to him (by a minor character who simply confesses out of the blue) and is due neither to his brains nor his instincts. It comes, in fact, at a time in the story when Grant is absolutely stuck and has no idea what to do next.  By this time he's made as many mistakes and ignored as many important clues as he's followed.  Perhaps this was Tey's way of showing us the fallibility and humaness of the police, but is that what we want in our fictional sleuths?  Give me someone omniscient like Poirot or Peter Wimsey any day.	2001-05-02

While never as good, the Malloy books were always a fun, quick read.  Lately, however, the series seems to have taken a distinct turn for the worse.  While the Maggody books continue to be ribald, wry and blissfully silly, the Malloy books have become muddled, badly written and stale (culminating in this negligible installment).  It's interesting how the same writer can miss so consistently with some characters and hit the target so often with others.  I've decided to skip Claire Malloy's future exploits and stick with Sherrif Arly Hanks and friends.	2001-04-16

With &quot;Missing Joseph,&quot; however, one begins to feel that she's falling a little too in love with the sound of her own voice.  Is it really necessary to describe every moment of every day of every character?  The real nuts and bolts of solving the &quot;whodunit&quot; doesn't really begin until nearly page 400 (of the paperback edition).  And I, for one, find the romantic travails of the four bed-hopping protagonists more intrusive than enlightening. More filler...George has been compared quite often to P.D. James.  Both fair and apt.  But what she could learn a little more of from James is BREVITY.	2000-11-22

I truly admire his sardonic wit, sense of the absurd  and insightful prose.  That said, I found this book, his first, to be a  disappointment.  Russo's storytelling abilities were not yet as strong, his  characterizations weak.  In fact, all of the people who populate the town  of Mohawk seem to be more archtypes than fully realized individuals.  The  book is divided in two parts, with a jump in five years, leading to abrupt  shifts in focus, inconsistency in character development and some hasty and  murky plotting.  The second half was just not as interesting to me as the  first, and almost seemed like a different book.  Russo's rapier-sharp wit  is in short supply, as well, which is one of his strongest assets as a  writer.  Any Russo is better than none, but if you haven't read him, I  would stick to the other two aforementioned books.	2000-05-08

In this, his fourth book, Russo takes on academia, marriage, middle-age,  parent-child relationships, loyalty to ones co-workers, father-son  conflicts -- all weighty issues -- and does so with brilliant insight and  laugh-out-loud hilarity.

It's a terrific debut, beautifully written, intelligent and complex.  If I have a single reservation, it may be that the story is a tad too complex, with some messy plotting that exists -- after all is said and done -- simply to provide red herrings. Also, there are so many surprise revelations (even involving  secondary characters) in the last 20 pages, that you almost expect to find  out on the last page that the whole thing was a dream, a la \\"Dallas.\\"  It's as if George, not knowing if there'd be a Book #2, threw into this one volume every plot development and twist she'd ever wanted to write.  In addition, it's somewhat unbelievable that Detective Havers would speak to her superior officer in such a demeaning, insulting fashion and still be kept on the job.  All that said, it is to George's immense credit that none of this seriously detracts from the pure pleasure of this First-Class mystery, one that ranks up there with the best of P.D.

Two plot lines are interwoven: the 1831 trial and execution of young Frankie Silver, and  Sheriff Spencer Arrowood's present day reinvestigation of a 20-year old  crime.  An additional two murders are thrown in for good measure, but have  little to do with anything.  Unfortunately it all adds up to very little.  The 1831 diary is a bore, mostly because we know the outcome from the  beginning.  It ends up being little more than an unending catalogue of  vintage minutae, interesting if historical fiction is your bag.  The  present day reinvestigation is not much more involving, despite McCrumb's  always valuable insights into human nature.  The solutions to the  &quot;mysteries,&quot; as they are, are obvious and not particularly  revelatory.  All in all, not McCrumb's best.	1999-11-26

In &quot;The Hangman's  Beautiful Daughter&quot; she pontificated about water pollution; in this  book it's the overdevelopment of the wilderness by unscrupulous realtors.  I sympathize with the issue, but feel sometimes that all the talk gets in  the way of the plot.  Also, the seven year old in this particular story is  just a little too well-spoken and philisophical for her years.  All that  said, time spent with McCrumb is time well spent.

The results are suprisingly rewarding, a succinct distillation of all that makes Dickens great.	1999-09-08

Perhaps she was feeling her way around a new protagonist with a less broad style.  In any case, I found the plot far-fetched, what with Alban's &quot;castle&quot; in  the middle of nowhere.  Eccentric is one thing, but this I found beyond  credibility.  I'm wary of investing more time in the McPherson mysteries,  and will probably stick to McCrumb's masterful Appallachian novels, in  which the writing is simply superb.	1999-09-08
US	52130819	R2VN9YHJVM3HW8	038533401X	186149727	City of Light	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Recommended, with reservations	&quot;City of Light&quot; is a wonderful, richly detailed evocation of a fascinating time and place; what it isn't is a great mystery.  I'm a huge fan of the mystery genre, and would have preferred either more surprises,  or revelations that were...well, surprising.  That said, Belfer knows how  to write, which is in itself a blessing these days.  Worth the time, but  don't expect plot twists and shocks.	1999-08-24

In the final analysis, it seems not much more than an exotic  Harlequin romance.	1999-04-22

With great warmth and humor, he deftly weaves together the personal and  political.  Never boring (miraculously so for such a long book) this is a  good bet for anyone who appreciates historical sagas.	1999-04-21
