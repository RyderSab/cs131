After \\"Casino Royale\\" (1953) introduced James Bond to the world, Ian Fleming quickly followed up with his second novel, the vastly superior \\"Live and Let Die\\" (1954).  Whereas its predecessor is an apprentice work and one of the weakest of the whole series, \\"Live and Let Die\\" is fine Fleming, with all the characteristics that mark the best Bond novels: quick pacing, deft characterization, a solid plot, and Fleming's own inimitable style.<br /><br />The plot is straightforward: someone is smuggling gold coins into the US and the British Secret Service wants to find out who.  M sends Bond to America, where he hooks up Felix Leiter to pursue the nefarious Mr. Big, a gigantic Haitian who works for SMERSH and uses voodoo to maintain his control over his minions.  Bond, of course, succeeds, but only after much death, suspense, and sexual tension with Solitaire, his delicious female companion.<br /><br />I would rank \\"Live and Let Die\\" in the second-tier of Bond novels, along with \\"From Russia, With Love\\" and \\"Moonraker.\\"  It doesn't quite reach the level of such absolute masterpieces as \\"Doctor No,\\" \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\\" or \\"You Only Live Twice,\\" but it's certainly superior to such relatively weak entries as \\"Goldfinger,\\" \\"Casino Royale,\\" and the disastrous \\"The Man with the Golden Gun.\\"  All in all, a classic Bond thriller.	2005-07-28

John Hardman's superb biography of this much-maligned king has many virtues.  First, it offers a sorely needed examination of the personality and motivations of Louis, and does so with a refreshing lack of bias.  The reader encounters the king without prejudice--a man who was much more intelligent, self-aware, and courageous than one might think, given the constant Louis-bashing that characterizes most accounts of the final days of the old regime.<br /><br />Second, Hardman offers a concise and clear overview of the numerous interacting forces that ultimately spelled disaster for both Louis and, in the end, France itself.  Louis bears the blame for much of this, but he was also a product of his time and lineage.  In a number of situations, he could have turned the course of history had he seized the initiative.  He didn't, and paid with his head, as did tens of thousands of his subjects.  Ultimately, however, the roots are to be found in the social and political structure of early modern France itself.<br /><br />Finally, Hardman gives the reader an excellent synthesis of the historiography of both the twilight of the ancien regime and the dawn of the French Revolution.  These various interpretations, consisting of both primary and secondary sources, give insight into how those momentous years have been interpreted through the centuries.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent and necessary book about a kind but unfortunate man.	2005-01-09
US	50589118	R2VHWLOPSSXVM3	0142002070	215240726	From Russia with Love	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Solid and suspenseful Bond novel.	Ian Fleming's fifth James Bond novel, &quot;From Russia, With Love&quot; (1957), remains one of the most popular and exciting in the series.  Here we see all the attributes that made Fleming such a remarkable thriller writer--the brilliant descriptive passages, the superb characterization, the ability to inject tension and suspense into the narrative until the inevitable explosion of violence.  &quot;From Russia, With Love&quot; has it all, and then some.<br />The plot is among Fleming's most ingenious.  SMERSH, the Soviets' dreaded counterintelligence agency, hatches to a plot to kill Bond and humiliate the British Secret Service.  Using an unwitting girl and a valuable piece of Russian hardware, the Russians lure Bond to Istanbul, setting the plot in motion.  Along the way, we meet the grotesque Rosa Klebb, head of torture and murder for SMERSH, and Red Grant, SMERSH's chief executioner.  Grant, in particular, is a chilling character, a bloodthirsty psychopath with a lust for killing.  When Bond crosses his path, Fleming produces some of the most gripping writing of his career.  Fantastic stuff.<br />All in all, &quot;From Russia, With Love&quot; is a superb thriller, though I found the narrative rather slack during Bond's time in Istanbul.  That minor quibble aside, this is a must-read for Bond fans and one of Fleming's finer accomplishments.	2004-05-28

After the magnificent &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1964), which carried the Bond series to a level beyond its previous heights and remains Fleming's finest novel, many readers had high hopes that Fleming's final Bond outing would be of high quality as well.  They were bound to be deeply disappointed.<br />This is the worst published fiction (albeit posthumously) Fleming ever wrote; indeed, it is, by common consent, the worst of all the James Bond novels (including the much maligned &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;).  Even some of John Gardner's later forays from the 1980s are better than this.  Fleming is clearly uninspired, even bored, and the limp plot is in no way helped by the character of Scaramanga, who, rather than being menacing, is reduced by Fleming to an obnoxious, stupid, loudmouthed bully.  Easily the worst villain Fleming ever conceived.<br />This was written in the last months of Fleming's life, and it may have been a rough draft.  Let us hope it was very rough.  It probably should never have been published, but it is not worth reading unless one is a Bond completist.	2004-05-25

It introduced readers to James Bond, a character who is now firmly ensconced as an icon in the popular imagination.  So how does it hold up now, 41 years later, after the character of Bond has been reduced to a self-regarding poseur in film after film?  Unfortunately, not that great, especially when compared with the stronger novels in the series.<br />Here we have Fleming finding his voice, and also feeling out the character of Bond, who is not fully realized.  The brilliant descriptive gifts that Fleming shows later in the series (it is already more pronounced in the second novel, \\"Live and Let Die,\\" published in 1954), the ability to bring characters to vivid life, to capture the tension of Bond's life as an agent--in other words, the techniques that a novelist acquires with practice--are seen here in rather primitive form.  The plot is disjointed, with the villain eliminated only two-thirds of the way into the book.  And the last third--well, it contains some writing that is downright embarrassing, especially compared with the talent Fleming shows in later works like \\"Doctor No\\" and the magnificent \\"You Only Live Twice.\\"  Again, this is an apprentice novel.<br />As for the character of Bond, he is most unappealing here.  He lacks the humor and personal likeability that Fleming gave him as the series progressed; here, he is a humorless, dour, arrogant man, and when Fleming injects the last chapters with bogus melodrama, it makes Bond even less interesting.<br />That is not to say that \\"Casino Royale\\" doesn't have its good points, but they are relatively small compared to its shortcomings.  This is worth reading for Bond fanatics only.	2004-05-23

It is unlike any of the other Bond books, with a pervasive gloominess that was as much the result of Fleming's rapidly declining health and unhappiness with the world around him as it was the result of Bond's clinical depression after the tragedy that finished the last book.<br />Bond, recovering from the death of his wife, is falling to pieces.  Taking the advice of a friend, M sends him on a vital mission to Japan, which he hopes will restore Bond's spirits.  What seems at first to be a rather placid visit soons turns dangerous as Bond agrees to accept secrets about the Russians in exchange for carrying out a delicate mission for the Japanese government.  What he encounters is the culmination of the previous two Bond novels, and the last half of the novel is virtually unputdownable.<br />This is the best writing of Fleming's career, and his descriptions of Bond's disintegration are surprisingly moving.  The final hundred pages or so are horrifying and gripping; never before had Fleming demonstrated such mastery of his craft or technical skill at setting up a denouement.  The tension becomes almost unbearable.<br />&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; is not an uplifting book, but it is a vital book in the Bond series, and much better than its successor, the pale and posthumously published &quot;Man With the Golden Gun.&quot;  Those expecting slam-bang action will have to wait until the middle and final chapters, but the rewards are worth the patience.  This is a fine novel, but I wouldn't start here if I were just discovering Fleming's Bond novels.	2004-05-22

He would churn out one Bond novel a year, during the summer, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica.  This kind of routine can be deadening when one writes without inspiration, and, unfortunately, that's what apparently happened when he wrote &quot;Goldfinger.&quot;<br />This isn't a bad novel, but compared with the better Bond books, this is pretty weak.  The plot seems hastily assembled, is far-fetched, and the ending seems rushed and improbable, even for Fleming.<br />That said, it does have its good points.  The villain, Auric Goldfinger, is one of the most fully realized characters Fleming ever created, and Oddjob is certainly a menacing strongman.  The early chapters, where Bond teaches Goldfinger a lesson and then trails him across Europe, are mostly good, but the golf game goes on WAY too long and seems indicative of Fleming's general lack of ideas here.  The last several chapters are a mess; the whole idea of robbing Fort Knox wasn't that great to begin with.<br />All in all, &quot;Goldfinger&quot; is little more than a mediocre addition to the Bond series.	2004-05-20

Like most pipe smokers, I have a passion for pipe history, trivia, and tobacciana.  Our hobby can become consuming, and this aspect of pipe smoking is evident in Jeffers' \\"The Perfect Pipe.\\"  Trivia and anecdotes abound.  Unfortunately, so do recycled facts about pipe making and the inevitable list of famous pipe smokers.<br /><br />All in all, this is a solid introduction to the hobby.  But do we really need yet another chapter on how briar pipes are made?  Or another witty quote on smoking from Mark Twain?  I don't think so.  I would have liked more information about various tobaccos (a history of, say, My Mixture 965 or Prince Albert would have been welcome), or perhaps about the tobaccos of choice of these famous smokers.  Alas, I get another chapter on how to pack a pipe.<br /><br />For beginning smokers, this book is a fine introduction.  For more seasoned and experienced devotees, Richard Carleton Hacker's books on the subject offer more stimulating reading.<br /><br />\\"A pipe in the hand proves that there has been no mistake--you are undoubtedly a man.\\" -- A.A.

A solid, suspenseful plot; an evil, over-the-top villain; M puffing away impatiently on his pipe; and Bond, ready for action and maybe a little love.<br />Sir Hugo Drax is a national hero in Britain, and is donating millions of his own pounds to create the Moonraker rocket, which can hit any city in Europe and, therefore, protect England from invasion by any enemy.  But when M discovers that Drax cheats at cards, a plot is set into motion that will eventually lead to Bond uncovering the tycoon's true designs.<br />This is a perfectly respectable entry in the series, but does not attain the heights of, say, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; or &quot;You Only Live Twice.&quot;  There is less action than one might expect, and the suspense sometimes sags.  But still, this is a solid thriller and I recommend it to anyone interested in the original Bond novels.	2004-05-19

Ian Fleming (1908-1956), a reactionary, nationalist, misogynist snob, was, at his best, a superb writer of thrillers.  Not all the Bond books are first-rate, but when Fleming's imagination was firing on all cylinders, he was capable of great stuff.<br />&quot;Doctor No&quot; (1958) shows him at his finest.  Its story is one of his more outlandish, and the romance a little more mushy than usual, but in terms of plot, suspense, and non-stop danger, this is as exciting as the Bond books get.  If you've seen the movie, you basically know the plot, though there are a few minor differences.  If you've never read a Bond novel before, this is as good a place as any to start.<br />Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a Secret Service agent.  It is soon apparent that there is much more afoot than he had anticipated, and a third of the way into the novel, Bond is sailing by night to the island of Doctor No, determined to find out the truth.  Along the way the loses a friend, charms a babe, and foils the nefarious machinations of the evil doctor.  Oh yeah--and he kills a giant squid.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-05-18

Thanks to such books as &quot;The Lives of the Great Composers&quot; and &quot;The Great Pianists,&quot; Harold Schonberg (b. 1915) remains a very well-known critic and historian of music.  In his time (1960-1980) as the senior music critic of the New York Times, Schonberg was a controversial figure, a vociferous opponent of the serialism that reigned as the dominant idiom of the era, and a man who expressed his opinions with a self-assurance and superiority that many composers and readers found infuriating.  No matter what one's feelings about Schonberg's taste, however, there was no denying his passion for music and his erudition on any number of subjects, from opera singing to piano performance practice.<br />This collection of essays runs from the 1950s (when he was one of several music critics at the Times) to the year of his retirement in 1980.  It includes many superb and compelling essays on everything from Rossini's late piano pieces and the brilliance of Scott Joplin to the provincialism of translated opera and Max Reger.  Lovers of classical music will inevitably find numerous pieces here that will alternately delight and enrage them.  Schonberg's range of interests and his trenchant prose make most of this book a treat, and the preface, a long autobiographical piece in which the author recounts his career and experiences as a critic and &quot;music addict,&quot; is particularly fascinating.<br />However, it must be said that there are far too many pieces of a dull and superficial nature to make this collection a complete success.  &quot;Jiggery Pokery, Musical Jokery&quot; and &quot;The Story of Santa and His Awful Symphony&quot; might have conveniently filled space in the Times, but in a career-spanning anthology, they really have no place.  Surely there were much more worthy selections among the hundreds of essays Schonberg wrote during his time as a critic.  Unfortunately, he chose these.<br />Despite its sometimes poor selections, &quot;Facing the Music&quot; remains a book that no serious music lover or student of modern music history will want to do without.  It is a witty, largely wonderful guide to classical music by one of that beleaguered art form's greatest writers.	2004-05-03

The 1920s were his prime years, and none of his novels was more renowned than &quot;Babbitt,&quot; which merited special recognition from the Swedish Academy when Lewis won the Nobel Prize.<br />So what is one to make of this novel now?  It can be dreadfully dull, and could (indeed should) have been cut in half.  It wanders around in search of a plot, and though many of its insights can be funny, overall one has to marvel at how genteel the literature of 1920s was in order to make this book a national sensation.<br />Basically, it is the story of George F. Babbitt, a solidly Republican, supremely self-satisfied, deeply stupid real estate man, who has a sort of midlife crisis in the course of the novel before returning desperately to his earlier state of censorious complacency by the last chapters.  Lewis designed him to be an exemplar of his class, and many thought he was.  The term &quot;Babbitt&quot; became a popular way of referring to chubby, materialistic businessmen.  And then, by the 1940s, the novel had largely faded into oblivion, except in college classes or high school reading lists.<br />Why?  Quite simply, because it's not a particularly good novel.  It is a reasonably well-written slice of satirical social commentary, and little more.  Today, it is merely a cultural relic from the twenties, kind of like the abominably bad &quot;Great Gatsby,&quot; which dilettantes rave over as if it were actually a good novel.  It isn't, and neither is &quot;Babbitt.&quot;  But for those interested in how America saw itself just before theGreat Depression, books like these might be informative.	2004-05-03

Music theory is kind of like math.  Some people are good at theory, but hate studying it; some have a complete theory block and can't understand even the fundamentals.  And some, like me, love it, are good at it, and enjoy it for its own sake.<br />For those who are interested in this vast and sometimes intimidating subject, Kostka's &quot;Tonal Harmony&quot; is a superb, well written, extremely thorough, and largely lucid guide.  This is the text I used in both college theory classes and in the independent study I did with a University of Oregon doctoral student, and in both cases I found it very useful.  To get much out of it, one really should have some background in theory, but with at least a modest understanding of the subject, this book is one that can be used alone by the self-motivated musician.<br />Everything from four-part writing and figured bass to secondary functions and French augmented sixth chords is covered here.  In fact, unless you are getting a Ph.D. in music theory, there's a lot here you'd never need to know.  Kostka and his co-writer include many exercises at the end of each chapter, and there are a couple of chapters on post-tonal theory at the end of the book.<br />There will never be a perfect guide to music theory, since it's such a complex subject.  There will also never be a perfect guide to physics.  That doesn't mean this book can't be of use to you.  Highly recommended.	2004-05-03

Rudolf Bing (1902-1997) is best remembered as the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera between 1949 and 1971.  During this time, he established himself as a celebrity in the US and re-established the Met as arguably the greatest opera house in the world (though Georg Solti's decade, 1961-1971, at the Royal Opera is still reckoned as its best).  By the time of his retirement at 70, Bing had left an indelible mark on the international music scene.<br />But, surprisingly, the most interesting parts of this memoir are the pages concerning Bing's life before the Met.  He served his apprenticeship in various adminstrative and management roles at opera houses in Germany and Austria before coming to help at Glyndebourne in the early thirties; by 1936, he was the general manager.  In the mid-forties, he founded and organized the Edinburgh Festival, before taking over the Met at the age of 47.  These early chapters form a revealing portrait of life in the European opera houses of the early 20th century.<br />Upon arriving at the Met, Bing's memoir loses steam, at least to this reader.  There are several fascinating anecdotes, especially of his problematic dealings with Callas and Karajan, but the last two-thirds of the book are much less riveting than the first.  Overall, however, this remains an invaluable document for those interested in classical music and the history of opera, and is well worth reading.<br />On a sad note, it should be remembered that Bing spent the last twelve years of his long life being robbed blind and taken advantage of by his grasping (and mentally unstable) second wife, whom he barely knew, suffering as he was from Alzheimer's.  Their marriage was annulled by the state of New York and he died, alone and forgotten, in a nursing home, his bills generously paid for by the Metropolitan Opera.	2004-05-01

Like his fellow chickenhawk and laptop liberator, Andrew Sullivan, Hitchens is a transplanted Englishman who came to the US to tell us what our foreign policy should be, what constitutes American patriotism, and where our soldiers should be sent to die.<br />This book is a good example of his work.  Hitchens became a right-wing courtier to such politcal titans as Lindsey Graham and Rick Santorum during the Clinton impeachment era, and is now firmly ensconsed as a reliably right-wing commentator on a host of issues.  Here he argues that Saddam was a threat that had to be eliminated--this despite that fact that, after over 700 US deaths, no WMD in sight, and the creation of our very own quagmire in the heart of the Middle East, we still have no good reason to be in Iraq.  And Osama continues to plot.<br />Perhaps Hitchens should stick to what he does best--getting drunk, cheating on his pregnant wife, and making an ass of himself at Washington soirees.

Instead, Nietzsche uses his discussion of this art form to analyse trends he saw in the Germany of the early-1870s and to examine the similarities between the Hellenic world and  the world of Bismarckian Germany.<br />He begins with an explanation of the dual Apollonian and Dionysian tendencies in art.  The Apollonian, based on illusion, form, and restrained aesthetic contemplation, is contrasted with the Dionysian, which is characterized by a visceral, ecstatic, transcendental state.  To Nietzsche, Greek tragedy was the only art form which was able to merge these two conflicting aesthetics into a successful union.  He likens the operas of his then-hero, Richard Wagner, to the tragic drama of ancient Greece, and suggests that this similarity should be a cause of hope for the renewal of the \\"German spirit.\\"<br />Crazy?  Of course.  Nietzsche was not a man noted for his intellectual restraint, and his associative thinking is never wilder or more disputable than in \\"The Birth of Tragedy.\\"  It is this very wildness which would later lead the philosopher to all but disown this book.<br />But \\"The Birth of Tragedy\\" is more than far-fetched theorizing--it is also a penetrating gaze into the destructive side of pure reason and the sunny optimism of the Enlightenment, which Nietzsche posits as being embodied in ancient Greece in the form of Socrates, whose withering, anti-aesthetic thinking Nietzsche finds deadening and repugnant.  In the hyper-rational, heavily bureaucratic world in which he found himself at the dawn of the 1870s, Nietzsche looked to the colossal operas of Wagner to find a counterbalance to the icy skepticism of Socrates (and the Enlightenment) and what he considered to be a fundamental misunderstandingof ancient Greek culture on the part of his contemporaries.  In stark contrast to their appraisal of Greek culture as serene and harmonious, Nietzsche located the enduring greatness of the Hellenic world in its brave and fierce pessimism, which he saw best represented in tragedy.<br />\\"The Birth of Tragedy,\\" then, is a cry of hope from its author for what he considered a renewal of German myth and unity.  It does not make for easy reading, however, and the reader should be prepared for many, many pages of exhausting and often ludicrous \\"insights,\\" not one of which makes much sense from a logical point of view, but all of which play a vital role in Nietzsche's brilliant and brilliantly original analyses of ancient and modern culture.	2004-01-16

Al Franken must be commended for his ambition.  To write a book about the lies of the Republican Party would be a multi-volume task, but Al has done a remarkable job of limning the blatant and exuberant dishonesty of the Right in a mere 300-plus pages.<br />The simple facts are that the Right in America is determined to undermine our freedoms, strip away civil rights, destroy Social Security and Medicare, and institute an all-white evangelical Christian theocracy.  They seek to silence dissent and use the tactic of lying on a Goebbels-like scale to undermine those who don't toe the party line.  Their true religion is fascism and they are defenders of the faith.<br />The constant and relentless telling of lies is the heart of their strategy.  When one has no genuine credibility, lies are the only recourse.  Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Bernard Goldberg, Andrew Sullivan, Robert Novak, Tucker Carlson--all the Propaganda Ministers of the Bush regime are professional liars who are fanatically devoted to The Cause.  The depths of their duplicity and immorality are carefully examined in &quot;Lies,&quot; and it's a truly enlightening experience to understand the agenda of our conservative media.<br />This is one of the most important books of our time, as we face an incredibly important election this year.  In 2004, we will decide whether democracy in America is worth keeping, or whether the cowardly millionaire draft-dodgers who are slaughtering American soldiers for their own corporate gain will continue to lead us down the road to serfdom.

Max Weber (1864-1920) is usually considered (with Emile Durkheim) one of the founding fathers of modern sociology.  Weber's interests in economics, law, bureaucracy, and religion led to some of the most scintillating writing ever produced in the social sciences, and his strenuous originality of thought, dense but lucid prose, and formidable analytical gifts invested his writings with lasting significance.  For a good place to start in exploring the works of this great scholar, &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the 'Spirit' of Capitalism&quot; would do nicely.<br />This is one of the definitive texts in the history of sociology, and its power and resonance can be seen in the fact that it remains in print nearly a hundred years after it first appeared.  In it, Weber traces the history and philosophical components of what he calls the &quot;spirit of capitalism,&quot; which is the worldview, arising originally out of the Calvinist concept of &quot;predestination,&quot; of the fulfillment of a worldly occupation (or &quot;calling&quot;) as the appropriate task of pious men who were understandably worried about their fate in the afterlife.<br />Because Calvinism and later forms of protestant religious practice placed an emphasis on overcoming the anxiety induced by predestination, the methodical distraction of immersion in a worldly occupation evolved into a view of lawful financial toil and accumulation of capital as an ethical end in itself.  With the eventual stripping away of the spiritual components of this idealism, we were left with the tradition of the following of a calling and the moral &quot;goodness&quot; of this worldly profession, the moral goodness, in other words, of economic participation and productivity.<br />Weber's brilliant and tightly argued thesis I find persuasive, though it has never ceased to be controversial.  We can see reflections of his ideas, however, in the modern tendency of &quot;conservative&quot; Christians to be radically anti-government and anti-regulation when it comes to business.  The idea of poverty as a gift from God to motivate the lazy, which many of the Christians described by Weber used to justify their own obsessive accumulation of wealth and refusal to redistribute it, is also evident in the social Darwinist tendencies of contemporary American Christians.  The fact that this approach to worldly life is diametrically opposed to Jesus' example and his teachings in, for example, the Sermon on the Mount, does not at all trouble these people, many of whom are about as likely to actually read the Bible as they are to vote Democrat.  Like the Calvinists and Puritans in Weber's analysis, their self-satisfaction exceeds any pangs they might receive from their inconvenient consciences.<br />&quot;The Protestant Ethic and the 'Spirit' of Capitalism&quot; is often held up as a stinging refutation of the Marxist concept of historical materialism.  In short, Weber proposes culture and society as the fundamental influence on historical and economic change, whereas Marx held that economics alone was the base which dictated to the superstructure.  To me, both ideas are compelling, and a full understanding of the implications they contain can only come from reading both and deciding for yourself.	2004-01-08

Sigmund Freud, whatever the variations in his posthumous reputation, remains the most compelling, daring, and persuasive analyst of the human condition we have.  His psychoanalytic theories of sexuality, sublimation, repression, etc., offer original insights that profoundly influenced the course of Western consciousness in the 20th century.  In addition to his gifts as a thinker, Freud was a master stylist, a man whose luminous prose and skillful argumentation make reading him a genuine pleasure.<br />\\"Civilization and Its Discontents,\\" one of Freud's last works, remains one of his most vital and important.  Don't be fooled by its brevity; this is a deeply complex and wide-ranging examination of Western civilization and its tensions.  Freud speculates about the origins of our modern societies, the difficulties of assimilating ourselves to them given our own individual psyches, and ends the book with a rather pessimistic look forward.  Clearly, Freud felt that civilization's \\"discontents\\" were an unresolvable fact of life.<br />What makes \\"Civilization and Its Discontents\\" so fascinating is Freud's application of psychoanalysis to Western society as whole.  He examines how the factors at play in our own psyches--family conflicts, sexual desire, guilt, the \\"death instinct,\\" and the eternal battle between our own self-interest and the interests of the human species at large--cause the problems that human beings encounter on a daily basis.  As always with Freud, his ideas are put forward not as a final statement, but as a tentative first step.<br />This is one of Freud's indispensable texts, and its accessible and absorbing style make it an ideal introduction for those who are seeking to discover this colossal mind for the first time.  A must read.	2004-01-05

Fredric Jameson (b. 1934) is one of the most influential and original thinkers of our time.  He first began to publish important work in the 1960s.  After earning a Ph.D. in French literature at Yale in 1959, Jameson revised his dissertation and published it as \\"Sartre: The Origins of a Style,\\" a book which is still one of the finest examinations of its subject.<br />Throughout the Sixties, Jameson read deeply in Marxist literature, from Mehring and Plekhanov to Adorno, Lukacs, and Sartre, and his extensive research and immersion in Marxism resulted in 1971's seminal \\"Marxism and Form,\\" a landmark in Marxist criticism and an unsurpassed dialectical survey of the 20th century's most important communist writings.  With this book, Jameson established himself as the foremost Marxist critic of his time, rivalled only by Terry Eagleton, whose approaches to criticism and the dialectic are highly disparate from Jameson's.<br />Jameson's interests and expertise are catholic, and his prose style, so often referred to as \\"difficult\\" or \\"impenetrable,\\" has always struck me with its elegance, precision, and singularity.  No one else writes sentences like him, and no other critic's prose offers as much sheer aesthetic pleasure.  In his criticism, Jameson's allusions and insights are always profound and original.  His powers of associative and lateral thinking are unique.  Whatever his subject, from critiquing a Balzac novel to limning \\"The Godfather,\\" Jameson's approach is resolutely Marxist and his dialectic fluid and densely erudite.<br />\\"The Jameson Reader\\" offers readers an excellent introduction to the world of Jameson's thought, with essays ranging from the state of Marxist criticism in modern academe to \\"narrative as a socially symbolic act.\\"  His groundbreaking examinations of postmodernism are included as well.  The introduction and commentary by the editors are superb throughout.<br />Anyone seeking familiarity with the work of Fredric Jameson should start with \\"The Jameson Reader.\\"  No one looks at our modern world with a more penetrating gaze, and if any modern critic's work will last, it is his.meson Reader.\\"  No one looks at our modern world with a more penetrating gaze, and if any modern critic's work will last, it is his.	2003-12-30

Rabbi Harold Kushner takes a hard look at difficult issues in \\"When Bad Things Happen to Good People.\\"  Written out of his own personal grief and struggle with spirituality, this book is an important and groundbreaking reassessment of what it means to believe in a god and how to reconcile that belief to the cold fact that horrible things happen in this world on a daily basis.  This is the fundamental tension of religion, and Kushner approaches it from an original and profound perspective.<br />Kushner is a Reconstructionist Jew and a former student of Reconstructionism's founder, Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan.  Reconstructionist Judaism examines spirituality from a metaphorical perspective, seeing God as the impulse in us that brings out our best traits and leads to live honestly and ethically.  It does not see God as an all-powerful father figure in the sky, interfering in people's lives and letting things like the Holocaust happen for a \\"reason.\\"  It is, in other words, a religious worldview that takes a more mature, probing approach to divinity than the standard \\"God controls everything and we cannot understand His ways\\" religious line.  There are numerous precedents for the Reconstructionist view in Jewish history.<br />Thus the negative reviews here from fundamentalist Christians, who believe every word of the Bible literally (though they can't be bothered to actually read it) and are unable to consider the thought of a more abstract god because their entire intellectual and spiritual house of cards would collapse.  This sort of \\"God-is-my-protective-daddy\\" view inevitably forces people of this mindset into a state of denial, obfuscation, and pretzel logic when they try to explain or defend their faith--even to themselves.<br />\\"When Bad Things Happen to Good People\\" is an enormously powerful book which offers a vital glimpse into a more humane and compassionate view of God.  I recommend it to everybody.	2003-12-19

Terry Eagleton is perhaps the best-known academic literary critic writing in English today.  Author of nearly 30 books on topics ranging from critical theory to Wittgenstein, Eagleton remains the political conscience of modern criticism and (with Fredric Jameson) the foremost Marxist theorist of our time.  His deep literary and philosophical erudition and commitment to a more humane approach to looking critically at our culture have made him an important voice in academia since the mid-1960s.<br />In &quot;Figures of Dissent,&quot; Eagleton turns his penetrating gaze to topics ranging from Lukacs to David Beckham, and his wit, learning, and elegant prose make this his most accessible and diverse collection of essays yet.  Unlike such earlier essay collections as &quot;Against the Grain,&quot; this book contains many of Eagleton's mainstream writings.  While it includes reviews of critical theorists like Gayatri Spivak, Paul de Man, and Stuart Hall, there are also examinations of popular history, fiction, and the culture of late capitalism.  Those with little interest in the abstract world of literary theory (Eagleton's academic specialty and principal interest) will find essays on other topics to entice them.<br />Overall, this is a fine collection from Eagleton, who remains an indispensable and passionate voice for Leftist thought in our tumultuous times.	2003-12-09

The pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty is one of the best-known and most renowned academic philosophers of our time.  In \\"Achieving Our Country,\\" he turns his ever-penetrating gaze to the state of Leftist thought in American history, focusing on both the important gains Leftists made in our country in the past, and why the Left is moribund today.  What results is a highly accessible, brilliant examination of what makes the Left the sustainer of hope in our modern era of quasi-Fascist brainwashing and chest-beating militarism.<br />To Rorty, the modern Left has abandoned the dreams of Debs, Dewey, and DuBois in favor of scholastic \\"theorizing\\" and defeatist fatalism, as exemplified by the unlearned scholars who populate most of the nation's humanities departments.  In exchange for any movement toward authentic social change, we are left instead with Foucault-reading pessimists, disillusioned by the aftermath of the Sixties and less interested in effecting actual progress than in \\"resisting\\" the system through barren exercises in jargon-laden \\"thought.\\"  This development over the last three decades, with its concomitant anti-Americanism, has made the Left largely impotent in the face of the well-organized, practical, and methodical assault from the Right.<br />To remedy this, Rorty proposes an abandonment of pointless theory and instead an active, pragmatic, dedicated effort toward the realization of the true principles that have made America great: diversity, social justice, civil rights, and a movement toward actual equality rather than the social Darwinist \\"conservatism\\" which dominates our current political landscape.  This is what the author means by \\"achieving our country.\\" As someone who has spent considerable time in English departments, I wholeheartedly agree with Rorty that a transformation is necessary if the Left is not to decline into total oblivion in the near future.<br />This is an important and insightful assessment of our culture and politics, anda superb primer for Leftist regeneration.	2003-11-29

Harry Lonsdale is little known outside Oregon, but he shook up the state's political world in the 1990s.  A millionaire scientist/businessman from central Oregon, Lonsdale's environmental concerns spurred him to run against Oregon political titan Mark Hatfield in the latter's 1990 run for a fifth term in the US Senate.<br />Hatfield was the aging golden boy of Oregon politics.  Elected to the Oregon House and Senate, as Oregon Secretary of State, two terms as governor, and then five terms in the US Senate, Hatfield owed much of his success to his reputation as a moderate, dovish Republican, who opposed defense buildups and used the power of the Senate Appropriations Committee (of which he was chair) to funnel billions of dollars into his home state.  Hatfield's persona as a gentleman politician was a false one, however, as Lonsdale demonstrates throughout his account of their 1990 battle.  Hatfield abused his power to control the Oregon media, instigate investigations into Lonsdale's past (which proved fruitless), and to raise millions of dollars in PAC and special interest money, which he used to fund a series of negative TV ads--ads which eventually won him the election.  If anything, this book is valuable as an insight into the real Mark Hatfield, a dishonest, career politician whose only interest was staying in office and maintaining his own power.<br />Lonsdale, on the other hand, initially had little going for him beside his own millions, which he poured into his campaign.  They came in handy.  By using his fortune, Lonsdale won the Democratic nomination and was able to get his message--against clearcutting of Oregon's forests, pro-choice, pro-campaign finance reform--out to the public.  By September 1990, Lonsdale was leading in the polls, and Hatfield rushed back from Washington, desperate to retain his position.  The race remained virtually neck-and-neck until election day, when Hatfield finally won 53%-46%--a result unprecedented in its slim margin of victory for the \\"invulnerable\\" incumbent.<br />Two years later, Lonsdale ran again, facing Congressman Les AuCoin in the Democratic primary.  Again, money made the difference, and with the Oregon press leaning characteristically towards well-known politicians, AuCoin's special interest cash and the media's anti-Lonsdale editorials eventually led to AuCoin's triumph--by only 300 votes out of over 300,000 cast!  AuCoin went on to defeat against the notorious Bob Packwood.  Lonsdale's final race in 1996, again in the Democratic primary, was less successful than the first two, as he was swamped early and decisively by a millionaire whose financial clout proved overwhelming.<br />\\"Running,\\" then, is more than just a fascinating and gripping political memoir.  It is also a revealing and somewhat depressing examination of the state of American electoral politics, with the incessant fundraising, special interests, and a politically controlled media proving more decisive, in the end, than the will (let alone the best interests) of the people.  It gives readers a behind-the-scenes view of how modern campaigns are run, financed, and ultimately won.  It shows how truly out of touch we are when it comes to dictating who we want to represent us, and it shows us how both of the two big parties work to maintain their own hold on power rather than work for the voters.<br />I highly recommend \\"Running\\" to all political junkies and concerned citizens.  It should be a wake-up call--and a call to arms.  We all need to work to preserve what little control we have over how our country is run.  And we should all thank Harry Lonsdale--a decent, honest citizen who wanted to make a difference--both for running, and for writing this book.	2003-11-13

After decades of lies, attacks, charges of \\"treason,\\" and millions of taxpayers' dollars spent to investigate nothing, the Republicans' extremism and penchant for divisive politics are catching up with them.  Clinton's victories in '92 and '96 showed that their grasp of the electorate was slipping, and Gore's victory in 2000 clinched it.  With the rise in immigration, women's education, and a movement to the left in social views, America is moving closer to an inevitable Democratic resurgence.  Moderate and liberal Republicans might survive (though the GOP is eating them alive--see Arlen Specter and Lincoln Chafee), but the hard-right ideologues who run and dominate the party right now are headed towards disaster, no matter how many elections they steal and voters they disenfranchise.<br />The Gingrichites have designed their own undoing.  Dubya has proven--yet again--that rigid Reagan/Hoover economics leads to disaster for the middle and lower classes (not that he cares).  Republicans quite simply cannot handle an economy to save their lives, and with their current destruction of our military at the hands of Ph.D.s and CEOs like Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld, their chest-beating militarism is backfiring as well.  They are not the party of \\"fiscal responsibility\\" and they are not the party for a strong \\"defense.\\"  Their duplicity is coming back to haunt them.<br />While it's good to acknowledge the emerging Democratic majority, it's still important to be vigilant and serious about bringing it about.  The 2000 Florida theft and the rigging of elections in Georgia last year (which cost patriot and war hero Max Cleland his rightful senate seat to a draft-dodging millionaire lawyer) show that the GOP is willing to do ANYTHING--even undermine the democratic process--to retain power.  Democrats need to fight them every step of the way to make sure honesty and integrity prevail.<br />This is a fantastic book which makes the case for our imminent majority clear, while supporting its claims with evidence on every page.  All progressives should read it and take comfort.  And remember--only 14 months to go before Bush gets the boot.	2003-10-31

It presents itself as the party of morality while preaching a hypocritical doctrine of social Darwinism.  David Limbaugh, whose only qualification as a \\"conservative\\" writer is his misfortune in being born Rush Limbaugh's baby brother, amply demonstrates the duplicity and hysteria of the modern Right in his new ghostwritten book on the plight of white Christian fanatics, \\"Persecution.\\"<br />This book is a terrifying chronicle of modern America.  Christians are no longer free to practice their religion on any level; they cannot attend church, pray in public, hold religious public gatherings, teach their beliefs to their children, or acknowledge \\"God\\" in any manner.  Actually, they can do all these things, and do all these things on a daily basis.  Apparently, Limbaugh feels that Christians are persecuted because they cannot force prayer on others at public events (eg, football games), endorse fundamentalism through government (eg, Chief Idiot Roy Moore and his law-flouting monument to himself in Alabama), or inflict their skewed and hellish worldview on everyone around them, try as they might.  This is the \\"victim mentality\\" at its least subtle.<br />One would think that having fanatical Christians in power in the White House, Supreme Court, and both houses of Congress would appease fundamentalists like those who run the Republican Party.  But, of course, it doesn't.  As long as gays live freely without punishment, as long as women are free to exercise control over their own bodies, and as long as our government refuses to endorse Jesus Christ as the supreme ruler of our land, fanatics on the Right will have something to whine about.	2003-10-05

Peter Singer's \\"Marx: A Very Short Introduction\\" is a superbly lucid and concise introduction to the subject of Marx and Marxism.  Assuming the reader has no background in Marx's thought, Singer covers most of the important issues of Marxism and then assesses Marx's achievements and shortcomings in a refreshingly balanced manner.<br />What makes this book such a valuable introduction is Singer's clear understanding of what lies at the heart of Marxism: the issue of human freedom.  Too many works on Marxism reduce it to a merely economic philosophy, which has the destruction of capitalism (and subsequent liberation of the world's workers) as its end.  This is a gross misrepresentation of Marx's thought.  Marx saw the destruction of capitalism and the establishment of a classless society as means toward the true end which he sought: the liberation of humanity from oppression and exploitation and a return to our true nature as creative, self-actualizing beings rather than mere laboring appendages to an economic machine.  Marx envisioned a world in which humanity toiled with its individual and universal fulfillment as the goal, rather than a world in which a few grow rich while the many dig ditches or work in Asian sweatshops for Nike.  Freedom, true freedom, was the purpose behind Marx's work and also his life.<br />I highly recommend this book as a serious, thorough, and fair introduction to this complex subject.

Not surprisingly, there are numerous rave \\"reviews\\" of this book here by other Amazonians.  Most of these people are the types who think \\"Don't Eat the Yellow Snow\\" is a significant work of late-20th century music and who throw around words like \\"genius\\" and \\"philosopher\\" whenever Zappa's name comes up.  They think that Zappa's songs, which they always rush to point out were \\"complex,\\" included serious, penetrating social commentary in addition to their \\"killer solos\\" and \\"freakin' funny\\" lyrics.  Unfortunately, for most of this book, its author, David Walley, also falls into this category of Zappaphile.<br />I'll be honest.  Frank Zappa's serious music (read: \\"instrumental music\\"), from the early \\"Hot Rats\\" to \\"Jazz From Hell,\\" his guitar solo discs, \\"The Perfect Stranger,\\" and \\"The Yellow Shark,\\" I find fascinating, exciting, and worthy of placement beside the works of other major late 20th century composers.  I write this as a classically trained musician with a background in piano, theory, and musicology.  Zappa loved (LOVED) name dropping Varese, Stravinsky, Webern, Takemitsu, and Penderecki, and in my opinion, his best music ranks with theirs.<br />His other music (read: anything with lyrics) I find about as scintillating, witty, and sardonically insightful as the latest opus by Weird Al Yankovic.  This is the junk by which he made his fortune, and while I respect the demanding nature of much of it, it's also ephemeral, juvenile, utterly worthless stuff.  Sadly, this is what attracts a lot of his fans, most of whom are not musicians and many of whom are fanatics who mistake FZ for a philosopher.<br />What does all this have to with this book?  David Walley is obviously not a musician, and so his relentless references to the \\"complexity\\" of FZ's music and his inevitable references to Webern, et al., mar this book with the stupidity of the musically unlettered geek who tries to write about music.  His attempts to write a \\"with-it,\\" Zappa-esque book make his social commentary approximately as riveting as his attempts at musical analysis.  His humor is heavy handed and usually annoying.<br />On the personal side, when he's not writing embarrassingly sycophantic psychobabble about Zappa, he does manage to reveal some interesting aspects of his subject.  Zappa was a control freak who used and abused musicians, stole many of their ideas while crediting himself, endlessly recycled his own material rather than spend his time coming up with worthwhile new works, and, in three decades of near-constant labor, managed to produce only a handful of worthwhile discs.  Not an appealing person.  His annoyingly smug cynicism had a dark side; Steve Vai once claimed that he almost had a nervous breakdown after leaving Zappa's band, thanks to his own adoption of Zappa's startlingly bleak and nasty worldview.  Apart from the (relatively little) good music, that is the man's legacy.<br />I hope someday a biographer will approach this subject responsibly and from a position of musical knowledge.  In this book, we have an author with no knowledge of music who is blinded by his personal feelings both for and against his subject.  From his early ecstatic proclamations of Zappa's genius (\\"philosopher\\"! \\"composer\\"!  \\"social critic\\"! \\"film maker\\"! \\"scientist\\"!), he descends into a scathing attack in the afterword.  Over three decades after its first appearance, this book remains as amateurish as its author's prose.	2003-07-05

For those who wonder why Marxism persists as an inspiration to millions throughout the world despite the collapse of &quot;communism&quot; in the late 1980s, this book will provide a lucid and inspiring answer.  Terry Eagleton, the foremost Marxist critic of his generation, takes only 57 pages to explain this extraordinarily complex (and fascinating) subject in lucid, straightforward prose, but he covers the subject with such enthusiasm and precision that this little book is worth any number of large, ponderous tomes on Marxism.  This is, quite simply, the best introduction to the subject.<br />Covering such ideas as surplus value, alienation, commodity fetishism, and other elements of Marx's thought, Eagleton touches only briefly on the subject of dialectics, which he reserves for the reader to investigate on her own.  He describes the truth of Marxism and dispels several myths, and by the end of this book, readers should have the preparation necessary for perusing the great man's work themselves.<br />We live in an era in which capitalism, imperialism, and Fascism are the rules of the game (see the Bush administration), and for those who wonder what other options exist in this world, Eagleton offers a tantalizing and important alternative.	2003-05-03

Most books that style themselves as &quot;introductions&quot; to literary theory fall short of their promise, often resorting to the same jargon the novice is trying to decipher or operating on the assumption that the reader already has a background in the field (which would preclude the need for an &quot;introduction&quot;).  This is the main flaw with Terry Eagleton's much used &quot;Literary Theory: An Introduction,&quot; which is as obscurantist as it is lucid.  Peter Barry's &quot;Beginning Theory,&quot; on the other hand, is the ideal primer for theoretical studies and is, bar none, the least polemical and most straightforward introduction to critical theory yet written.<br />Barry takes the reader step-by-step through most of the significant areas of literary theory (passing over reception theory and substituting an analysis of liberal humanism for the New Criticism), explaining their basic theoretical foundations carefully and clearly, with an emphasis on understanding through example rather than unfocused summary.  He provides basic examples of what critics try to do when they apply certain methodologies and then demonstrates the methods himself with short analyses.  If you have absolutely no background in critical theory, this book is the place to begin.  Barry is painstaking without insulting the reader's intelligence.<br />In short, if you're looking for a readable, thorough examination of the main trends of critical theory, &quot;Beginning Theory&quot; is the best starting point available.	2003-01-24

Terry Eagleton's &quot;Literary Theory&quot; advertises itself as a clear, lucid introduction to the topic, written for the unitiated.  In many ways, the book fulfills this promise, particularly in its discussions of the New Criticism, reception theory, hermeneutics, deconstruction and the overall arch of literary theory's history.  Eagleton also does a superb job of placing each of these theories within their sociopolitical context (no surprise there).  Most of this book is engaging and well-written.<br />There are weak areas, however.  In his discussions of structuralism, phenomenology and a few other areas, Eagleton gets bogged down and its difficult to get straight to the heart of these methodologies, which is ostensibly the point of this book.  Overall, though, I recommend this to anyone interested in literary theory as an historical and academic phenomenon, and as a fascinating subject in itself, even if you find much of it obscurantist and even devious (which many do).<br />People looking for other introductions to this topic might also look at the equally superb &quot;Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction&quot; by Cornell deconstruction guru Jonathan Culler, or Peter Barry's excellent &quot;Beginning Theory.&quot;	2003-01-17

Philip Roth's sixth novel, \\"My Life as a Man,\\" first appeared in 1974, after the author spent several years trying to use the material of his first marriage (to one Margaret Martinson) in a fictionalized setting. Readers of Roth's autobiography, \\"The Facts\\" (1988), know that his brief cohabitation and extensive legal battles with Martinson were harrowing enough to leave psychological wounds the author continued to lick for decades following her death in a car accident. \\"My Life as a Man,\\" according to \\"The Facts,\\" was a book that took an enormous toll, both artistic and emotional, on the author. But it's a good thing he was able to write it, because what we have is a tremendously gripping, chilling, bitter and often hilarious look at the dark side of \\"romantic\\" relationships.<br />The first section of the book, entitled \\"Useful Fictions,\\" includes two stories \\"by Tarnopol\\" documenting his carefree childhood and eventual entanglement with the psychopathic \\"Lydia.\\" Then the novel itself starts, under the title \\"My True Story.\\" What follows is enough to make anyone feel fortunate for a) being single or b) having a stable relationship. Martinson, who was \\"Lydia\\" in the first section, is here renamed \\"Maureen,\\" and is one of the most unforgettable women in American literature. Self-loathing, neurotic, violent, manic-depressive, grasping, hateful and literally insane, her relentless attempts to control and keep \\"Tarnopol\\" (Roth) are what gives these pages such intensity. Her hatred for Tarnopol and his hatred for her make this book unputdownable. Reading \\"The Facts,\\" one learns that much, if not most, of what occurs here actually took place in real life. No wonder Roth has \\"women issues\\" (or so the critics always say).<br />This remains one of Roth's most intelligent, finely crafted books. His use of dialogue is virtually unparalleled in modern fiction, and his sentences are as chiselled and graceful as one would expect of an artist of his caliber. In short, \\"My Life as aMan,\\" though not the most uplifting book of our time, is an extraordinary (and extraordinarily bleak) accomplishment.	2002-03-28

Golding's \\"The Inheritors\\" was originally published in 1955, and was his first book after \\"Lord of the Flies\\" made his name. Unfortunately, while his first novel was intriguing, well-written and suspenseful, \\"The Inheritors\\" is one of the most bizarre and confused novels of its time.<br />There's no real story here. Neanderthal man encounters cro-magnon, and is killed off. While it sounds like an exciting premise, this book actually consists of little more than endless, repetitious, vague landscapes, repeated over and over and over again. These landscapes, which describe each and every leaf, rock, patch of dirt or sparkle of light on the water of a flowing river, take up literally sixty percent of this brief but agonizingly slow moving novel's pages. Along with the landscapes, we are told in painfully tedious detail of each character's physical movements as he or she walks among the minutely described leaves, rocks and patches of dirt, while looking at the sparkle of the light on the river. These details take up most of the rest of the book. There is very little here that actually constitutes narrative; instead, there is only description and accumulation of sentences.<br />The two main characters, Fa and Lok, are quite different. While Fa is a smart and resourceful Neanderthal, Lok, who stands at the center of the descriptions, is extraordinarily dense and slow-witted, even for a caveman. Within a few pages, this reader found Lok annoying and exasperating. Why Golding chose to make him the center of the book is a mystery.<br />One last point. This novel seems to have been edited severely (and not particularly carefully) from a longer manuscript, since many pages and the entire second-to-last chapter don't flow together in a coherent fashion. This only adds to the book's inertia and mystification. It's amazing that this was ever published in any form.<br />I really wanted to like \\"The Inheritors.\\" Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish it and ended up loathing it as much as any book I've ever read.	2002-03-26

Originally appearing in 1959, \\"Advertisements for Myself\\" remains one of the most unusual books ever published by a novelist. Containing stories, essays, reviews, interviews, novel excerpts and poems, all with detailed, italicized annotations courtesy of the author, this book displays a massive, raging talent assessing itself and the world around it. It is sometimes poignant, sometimes maddening, but never less than compelling. I love this book.<br />Today, Mailer's reputation is rather up in the air. To me, his career is an example of an artist constantly pushing himself, writing with breathtaking ambition even if it exceeded his skill. There has never been another writer like Norman Mailer, and it is touching to read here of his desire to write a novel on the level of Dostoyevsky, Mann and Tolstoy, and to read his pithy, sometimes hilarious assessments of his contemporaries. His commentary on the ups and downs of his career and his disgust and sadness about the decline of American literature are illuminating, but his self-aggrandizement and egocentricity are often difficult to stomach. However, one has to stand in awe at the monument of his talent and his passion.<br />Reading this book today, one has to ask, \\"Did he fulfill his expectations?\\" I think so. \\"Harlot's Ghost,\\" \\"Ancient Evenings,\\" \\"The Executioner's Song\\" and numerous other works, both fiction and nonfiction, will endure, in my opinion. But I, for one, would like to know whatever happened to the self-promoted masterpiece of a novel he excerpts here. The small sections make for very stimulating reading.<br />All in all, \\"Advertisements for Myself\\" is a required text for everyone who loves great literature or aspires to write it for themselves.	2002-03-17

Kenzaburo Oe, the Japanese novelist who won the 1994 Nobel Prize for Literature, was 28 when his son, Hikari, was born.  This event was the most important in Oe's life.  Born with a herniated brain, Hikari has needed almost constant care since birth.  &quot;A Healing Family&quot; is Oe's first non-fiction attempt to make sense of Hikari's life and the effect it has had on the people around him, most importantly his family.<br />This beautiful book shows the profound love, affection and pride the Oe family take in Hikari's accomplishments and happiness.  From the age of five, Hikari has been obsessed with classical music, and eventually began to compose pieces for piano and violin.  Much of &quot;A Healing Family&quot; concerns Oe's attempts to understand his son through music.<br />&quot;A Healing Family&quot; is a book everyone should read.  Finely crafted, perceptive, intelligent and moving, it shows us again that compassion and empathy can make all the difference in the world.	2002-03-13

Scott Fitzgerald for being a terrible writer prone to injecting his novels with \\"bogus emotion.\\" He was right on the mark. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a pedestrian, pretentious book that has somehow made its way into the Great Novel section of American literature. This is by no means a great novel; it isn't even a particularly good one.<br />The story is thin and forced. Annoying, self-consciously clever characters (reflections of their creator) preen and weep through 185 pages of would-be Greek tragedy. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is annoying, as is virtually every other character in the book. In fact, there isn't a single person in this entire novel who is worth caring about. The prose is laughable and usually downright bad. Sometimes it was so incoherent and overwrought that it seemed to be poorly translated from another language.  Fitzgerald's attempts to be \\"poetic\\" invariably fall flat.<br />\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is little more than a relic of a past era, and not a very compelling relic either. Obviously, other readers will have to come to their own conclusions, but for me, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" should have been retitled \\"The Mediocre Novel.\\"	2002-03-06

Paul Theroux's \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" has taken quite a beating in some quarters. Many feel Theroux betrayed V.S. Naipaul by writing this memoir, but the fact remains that this is Theroux's story as much as it is Naipaul's. This book has been attacked for being nasty and unfair, but is actually an evenhanded and penetrating look at writing, friendship and human frailties.<br />Theroux meets Naipaul in Uganda in 1966. Over the next 30 years, they remain friends through wide distances, triumphs and failures, divorces and deaths. Naipaul emerges as an extraordinarily compelling character. Perceptive, brilliant, egocentric and obsessed with writing, he abuses and uses his friends, family and professional acquaintances. He is also generous, needy and sometimes kind. What we end up with is a portrait of a supremely gifted but infantile man who is a fascinating but sometimes repugnant human being. Theroux is brutally honest not just about Naipaul's faults, but his finer qualities. He uses that same objectivity towards himself as well. In the end, \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" betrays Theroux's hurt feelings after Naipaul terminates their relationship following his second marriage; it does not display meanspiritedness.<br />This superb memoir is a gripping read, from the first page to the last. The story it has to tell is well worth reading, and Theroux writes beautifully (as ever). All in all, I highly recommend \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow.\\"	2002-03-04

If so, it's a respectable way to end his literary career. Not really a novel, \\"Timequake\\" is something of a memoir/social commentary mixed with short bits of fiction featuring everyone's favorite homeless SF writer, Kilgore Trout. Vonnegut looks back on his life, marriages, family and friends and the state of our modern world while using Trout to illustrate the incredible stupidity and self-destructive tendencies of mankind at large.<br />Many of the stories are touching, as are the episodes featuring Trout. Several parts are laugh-out-loud funny. Vonnegut takes his by now familiar shots at greed, war, ecological destruction and meanspiritedness. There is a definite air of sadness that hangs over this book, but one has to admire the high polish and craftsmanship of Vonnegut's prose. He will be missed.<br />Overall, \\"Timequake\\" is a quick, witty, satisfying read, though no \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" or \\"Sirens of Titan.\\"	2002-02-20

During a career that lasted over five decades, Asimov wrote on more topics than virtually any other writer in literary history.  From the sciences to history and Shakespeare to the Bible, his clear, concise writing style and ability to simplify even the most complex ideas earned him the nickname \\"The Great Explainer.\\"  His fiction, with the exception of his early Foundation novels, \\"The Gods Themselves\\" and some shorter pieces, consisted largely of filler.  Nonetheless, by the time of his death, he was quite possibly the most famous SF writer of his time.<br />Asimov's first volumes of autobiography were published in 1979 and 1980.  As his health declined and the end drew near, his wife, Janet, encouraged him to write a third volume, less explanatory and more introspective.  He obliged.  \\"I, Asimov\\" lacks the surface detail of the early memoirs, but is rich in thought, emotion and self-revelation.  The man that emerges from these pages was witty, intelligent, kind, loyal and genuinely devoted to sharing his knowledge and talents with others.  He could also be vain and arrogant, but he is so honest about these less-attractive attributes that the reader is willing to forgive him anything.<br />There is a cloud of nostalgia and approaching death that hangs over most of \\"I, Asimov.\\"  The book was written when the author knew he didn't have long to live, and the book reflects that state of mind.  In the end, however, it is uplifting and optimistic rather than depressing and gloom-ridden.  What keeps me from giving it a full five stars is the rather dull middle section, which is significantly less interesing than the beginning and ending.  The first 150 pages of the book are particularly unputdownable.  All in all, this is a superb memoir and well-worth reading.  I highly recommend it.	2002-02-15

Stanley Kauffmann was born in 1916 and worked at various jobs (actor, director, novelist) before sending in an unsolicited review to The New Republic in 1958.  They accepted it, and soon Kauffmann was TNR's full-time film critic.  Except for short stints as drama critic for The New York Times and as a book reviewer for TNR (during which Pauline Kael served as the magazine's film critic), Kauffmann has retained his position ever since.  Today, at nearly 86-years-old, Kauffmann continues to write literate, penetrating, lucid essays for TNR.  He is, quite simply, the greatest critic the world of cinema has produced to date.<br />&quot;A World on Film&quot; was Kauffmann's first collection of film criticism.  Consisting of reviews and essays written between 1958 and 1965, it amply demonstrates the insight, passion and probity of Kauffmann's approach to film.  It also displays his extraordinary talents as a writer.  Each review is a finely-crafted work in itself.  While Pauline Kael tended to ramble (and ramble) in her reviews, departing far from the subject at hand in order to write about herself, Kauffmann is focused and concise, saying in a few words what most critics say in several paragraphs.  His assessments are fair and evenhanded; Roger Ebert once aptly described Kauffmann as the &quot;sanest of critics.&quot;<br />In short, &quot;A World on Film&quot; is a fine introduction to Kauffmann, film criticism and cinema circa 1958-1965.  It also makes for very pleasurable reading in itself.	2002-02-03

Maynard Solomon's writings have always been the source of controversy.  His application of Freudian and Marxist theories to his research makes his work unlike that of any other musicologist, and in terms of sheer scholarly erudition, there are few modern historians who can rival Solomon.  His biography of Beethoven was immediately acclaimed as a groundbreaking work upon its publication 25 years ago, and after decades of research, his long awaited life of Mozart appeared in 1995 and was, not suprisingly, the source of much discussion and rethinking about the great composer.<br />Many people have difficulties buying into Solomon's psychoanalytical, sociopolitical approach to biography.  His deep analysis of the psychological motivations of Beethoven was striking in his earlier work, but it reached new heights in his Mozart biography.  Each and every word, thought or action of the composer (and his family members) is explained and analysed in in painstaking detail.<br />As an admirer of Solomon's work, I was surprised to find myself sometimes annoyed with his overwrought Freudian psychobabble, but don't let that discourage you from reading &quot;Mozart: A Life.&quot;  This is easily the most illuminating, comprehensive and rewarding book ever written on its subject, and Solomon's accomplishments as a researcher cannot be overstated.  This has been rightly recognized as one of the great musical biographies yet written, and will probably remain the definitive life of Mozart for a long time to come.<br />Let us hope that Solomon (who turns 71 this year) has enough time left to write at least one more enlightening, shocking and profound musical biography.  Wherever Solomon turns his attention, the result is always compelling.	2001-08-02

Malzberg, who had aspirations (and certainly the talents) for a career in &quot;serious&quot; fiction, turned to science fiction during the mid- to late-60s after numerous rejections from literary magazines.  He went on to write over 76 novels and 300 short stories (not all of them SF) in a creative white heat that ended when he realized that, despite this formidable streak of artistry and prolificity, he remained unknown outside SF and maligned and misunderstood within it.  What remains is a body of work that is as uncompromising and challenging, but ultimately rewarding, as one is likely to find.  That Malzberg had been forced to write paperback originals and fall into obscurity when he had the gifts to be winning National Book Awards and heading PEN is a situation with implications not lost on the author; it is, indeed, downright Malzbergian.<br />Which brings us to &quot;Down Here in the Dream Quarter.&quot;  This volume features several late stories and two scathing essays (in addition to an illuminating preface) and is a fine introduction to Malzberg's short fiction.  Each story includes a short introduction by the author.  &quot;The Best of Barry N. Malzberg&quot; remains his finest collection of short works, but &quot;Dream Quarter&quot; is a more than respectable anthology and demonstrates not only the understandable bitterness the author felt at the end of his SF career, but also the fact that, in terms of ambition and skill, Malzberg was lightyears ahead of all but a handfull of his peers.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-08-02

Smith is no Mickey Spillane--he is a literate, cerebral writer and a first-rate novelist with an unusual gift for both probing, insightful characterizations and heart- pounding, edge-of-your-seat storytelling.  His Renko novels can best be described as Saul Bellow meets Robert Ludlum, and Smith's voice is distinctive and unmistakable.<br />&quot;Red Square&quot; finds Arkady in post-Cold War Russia, investigating murder and intrigue in a society rife with corruption and desperation.  He also reunites with his great love from &quot;Gorky Park,&quot; and Smith's description of the reunion is among his very best writing.  &quot;Red Square&quot; also features Smith's characteristically convoluted plotting, which can at times get confusing, but eventually resolves itself with the most satisfying ending he has yet written for a Renko novel.<br />All in all, &quot;Red Square,&quot; despite a rather slow first 40 pages or so, was one of the most fascinating and unforgettable thrillers of the decade.

As an opera and orchestral conductor, Fritz Reiner had few equals and no betters during his lifetime. From his apprenticeship at the Dresden Opera through his decades at Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, the Met and finally Chicago, Reiner displayed a consummate musicianship and technical prowess that were truly awesome to behold. His death in 1963 terminated one of the outstanding conducting careers of the 20th century.<br />Reiner's greatness as a musician, however, had little in common with Reiner the man. Fritz Reiner was one of the most feared, hated and tyrannical of conductors, and his extraordinary meanspiritedness and pettiness towards his players extended into his private life. In this biography, Philip Hart, who worked with Reiner in Chicago, shows him as a man with few discernable redeeming qualities. A more in-depth psychological portrait of Reiner would have been welcome, though Hart does address what he calls a &quot;deep seated psychological insecurity in his character.&quot; Reiner's heinous treatment of his musicians was carried over into his interactions with his wives, his children and his friends. He seems to have been a deeply self-loathing individual who took these feelings out on those around him, but also sublimated these same feelings into his art, with astonishing results.<br />Hart's biography is a decidedly mixed bag. It is often skimpy and superficial concerning personal matters, but also insightful and generous concerning his musicianship. The value of this biography, however, cannot be understated. Being the only biographical and critical profile of this colossal musician, Hart has done us a great service with this book, despite its obvious shortcomings. Anyone interested in great music or conducting will love this book.	2001-01-05

Love her or hate her (or both), it cannot be denied that Pauline Kael was the most important, witty, insightful, maddening, funny, infuriating, exhilirating and incisive movie critic of all time. For me, the only critic that equals her is her antithesis, the great Stanley Kauffmann. Kael burst upon the scene in the 1960s (though her first review appeared in 1953) and movie criticism has never been the same since. With her conversational, waspish prose style and absolute belief in the rightness of her convictions, Kael had a talent for inspiring both intense debate and intense thought. Her reviews were often more anticipated than the movies she wrote about. Her retirement in 1991 due to Parkinson's was a great loss for both movies and American literature: she was definitely one of the great essayists of the 20th century.<br />&quot;For Keeps&quot; is the definitive one volume Kael collection. From some of her earliest 1950s reviews to her last reviews for The New Yorker in 1991, virtually every important essay she ever wrote is here. Her most famous and controversial reviews (on &quot;Nashville,&quot; &quot;Last Tango in Paris,&quot; &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;) are all included, as well as her legendary &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; essay, &quot;Raising Kane.&quot; While Kael was an intellectual, writing for a (presumably) literate and educated audience, she was no cinema snob. Her joy in movies extended from Ingmar Bergman to &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me.&quot;<br />This is one of the great books on film ever published and a must have for any movie fan.	2000-12-30

Norman Lebrecht's &quot;The Maestro Myth&quot; is one of the most unique and controversial books on classical music ever published.  In it, Lebrecht chronicles the lives, careers and conflicts of several important maestros (many notable conductors are left out) from Hans von Bulow to Sir Simon Rattle.  I can scarcely think of another book on classical music that is as unputdownable or consistently fascinating, yet I had some strong reservations after finishing &quot;The Maestro Myth.&quot;<br />Though the stories are invariably fascinating (with the exception of one excruciatingly dull chapter entitled &quot;The Search for a Semi-Conductor&quot;), there never seems to be an overall central idea or theme to &quot;The Maestro Myth,&quot; despite its subtitle: &quot;Great Conductors in Pursuit of Power.&quot;  Very often, Lebrecht's writing is simply a collection of unflattering or embarrassing facts about various well-known musical personalities.  Also, Lebrecht can be extremely inconsistent.  Sympathetic towards Hans von Bulow, he follows it with an inexplicably nasty attack on Bruno Walter (who is portrayed generously and kindly in Sir Georg Solti's memoirs--and Solti was not one who minced words) and then ends with ten pages of bizarre sycophantic raving for Simon Rattle.  In between, he compiles the usual litany of grievances against Toscanini and writes a hyperbolic and often blatantly dishonest thirty plus page attack on Herbert von Karajan.  There are other examples.  The bottom line is that Lebrecht often lets sensationalism interfere with fact.  That is the biggest drawback to &quot;The Maestro Myth.&quot;<br />That said, &quot;The Maestro Myth&quot; is well worth reading, indeed required reading, for anyone interested in the politics and tumultuous insider dealing involved in the 20th century conducting world.  Fascinating overall, &quot;The Maestro Myth&quot; needs to be read with a grain of salt.	2000-12-01

Most people who would be interested in reading &quot;Knowing When to Stop&quot; are probably familiar with Rorem's diaries.  His memoir ends the year he first started the journals contained in &quot;The Paris Diaries,&quot; and &quot;Knowing When to Stop&quot; not only fills the autobiographical, pre-diary gap, but also stands as one of most extraordinary self-portraits ever written.  Rorem recounts, in his graceful, inimitable style, his childhood, musical training, early sex life (of course), his first years in Europe and, most absorbingly, his friendships with some of the most famous artists, both musical and otherwise, of the century.  Bernstein, Cage, Katchen, Thomson, Copland, Boulez, Capote, Paul and Jane Bowles--Rorem describes them with sympathy and insight.  Rorem's own mortality hangs shadowlike over every page of &quot;Knowing,&quot; and his assessments of his work and life are penetrating and brutally honest.  All in all, one of the best books I've ever read and a poignant, profound meditation of life and art.	2000-11-20

First, it tells the story of one of Hollywood's most enigmatic and legendary icons without resorting to hyperbole or the sort of highblown psychobabble so many other, lesser writers would have stooped to.  Second, it is meticulously researched and tells Garbo's story honestly, responsibly and thoroughly, including her mysterious days as New York's Most Famous Recluse.  Finally, it delves deep into the heart of what made, and continues to make, Garbo one of the enduring figures in 20th century popular culture.  Paris reveals the woman behind the dark sunglasses--and she turns out to be much more interesting than one might think.  Garbo, it seems, was a woman of vast contradictions, who ultimately became the victim of both her own compulsive need for privacy and her vast emotional ambivalence.  This is the biographical art at its finest, and highly recommended.	2000-10-20
US	50589118	R2ALAYAQYIG3WY	0684833743	451667811	The Unruly Life of Woody Allen: A Biography	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Well written, but uneven biography.	I've always wondered why people would bother to spend considerable amounts of time and energy researching, interviewing, compiling facts and writing biographies of people they obviously intensely dislike.  Marion Meade's disdain for Woody Allen is almost palpable on every page of this book.  Basically, she presents Allen as a contemptible, meanspirited, self-absorbed, self-loathing misanthrope capable of teutonic cruelty and with nary a redeeming quality.  So the question is: why bother?  Sure, her subject is full of flaws (big surprise) and probably won't be publishing a guide to successful relationships anytime soon, but he does deserve better than this.  That said, this book isn't your usual Kitty Kelley trash.  It is meticulously researched and gracefully written, at times insightful and illuminating and extensively annotated.  The author has done her homework and written this book with considerable effort and care.  However, I couldn't get over the fact that she seems to more or less hate Woody Allen, even while describing the factors in his childhood and background that might have led to the behavior she condemns.  This is, however, the best of all the Woody Allen biographies (the others were poorly researched or simply sycophantic), and worth reading, if one reads with an open mind.	2000-09-24

Prep school- and Ivy League-educated son of an aristocratic, rich Connecticut US Senator, he transplanted himself to Texas  and (with a resounding lack of success) tried to re-invent himself as an  old-school Texan.  He lost two consecutive attempts to become a US Senator  himself, and would have been a completely forgotten political wannabe had  it not been for the charitable help of Presidents Nixon and Ford, who  appointed the &quot;wimp&quot; to some key positions, which obviously made  Bush think he was competent enough to become president, because he then ran  in 1980.  After being destroyed by Reagan in the primaries (and denouncing  Reaganomics as &quot;voodoo&quot;), he then received some more remarkable  charity when Reagan picked him for his running mate.  After eight years as  Vice President, Bush finally won the presidency (although he never would  have won if he hadn't have been Reagan veep) and soon proved as incompetent  at that job as Dan Quayle at a spelling bee.  In short, Bush was a  politically unsuccessful, rich New Englander who happened to have been  picked for the right jobs by a couple of America's other worst presidents,  and was then able to become President himself.  An uninspiring, dull story  and an OK book at best.	2000-09-03

Bush calling himself &quot;bold and decisive&quot; is funny?  Republicans have always been renowned for their biting satirical  skills (think of Gordon Liddy and Put Buchanan), but this is perhaps the  finest example of the fact that Republicans can do more than speak at  racist, anti-Catholic colleges and triple the national debt in eight years  ('81-'89)--they are also sans peer as political satirists.  With this book,  &quot;J.P. Mauro&quot; demonstrates that someone can actually write three  hundred pages worth of &quot;jokes,&quot; and still fail to include one  that is actually funny.  No small feat.  This book is a truly pathetic  attempt to counter Al Franken's brilliant, hilarious &quot;Rush Limbaugh is  a Big Fat Idiot&quot; (perhaps the most accurately titled book of the '90s)  with some right-wing barbs.  I hope everyone in America buys this book.  It  will prove everything I've been saying for years about Republicans.	2000-09-02
US	50589118	R2WF21QYVEIE2J	0671707418	954430457	RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon	Books	3	9	31	N	N	Fascinating read.	Richard Nixon was the closest America has ever come to electing a Fascist to the presidency.  His neurotic, spiteful contempt for his country and his  office were truly mindboggling to behold.  He would sink to virtually any  depth to destroy enemies and, more importantly, further himself.  All these  die-hard Republicans writing worshipful reviews of this book should bear in  mind that no-less a Republican icon than Barry Goldwater disdained Nixon as  &quot;the most dishonest man I have ever met.&quot;  Inevitably, Nixon was  his own worst enemy, as his self-destructive, self-loathing personality  triggered the greatest disaster in the history of the presidency:  Watergate.  That said, however, &quot;RN: The Memoirs of Richard  Nixon&quot; is about as compelling an autobiography as you're going to come  across.  Nixon was a key player in many of the great conflicts of the  century, and his accounts of his political life make for truly fascinating  reading.  The glimpses into the personal side of Nixon reveal a cerebral,  compulsive man, ill-equipped to deal with the dark sides of his own psyche.  These insights are what makes &quot;RN&quot; by far the most gripping  presidential memoir yet written.  Camille Paglia once wrote of this book  that Nixon's fall and unprecedented disgrace unleashed a &quot;Proustian  flood of remembrance&quot;--and &quot;RN&quot; is indeed Proustian, as  Nixon recounts, almost obsessively, virtually every conceivable detail of  his political life in well over a thousand pages.  His desperate attempts  to perform damage control on his legacy aside, &quot;RN&quot; is an  extraordinary self-portrait by one of the most important players in 20th  century American life.	2000-08-15

Gene Lees's &quot;Inventing Champagne&quot; is a terrific look at the partnership that spawned &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; &quot;Gigi&quot; and &quot;Camelot&quot;--the collaboration between lyricist / librettist Alan  Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe.  Based upon exhaustive research  and hundreds of interviews, this is the only book that tells the story  behind some of the greatest works ever written for either stage or screen.  Lerner comes across as a supremely gifted neurotic; Loewe as equally  gifted, and vastly arrogant, yet free of the wild ambitions and assorted  personal problems that plagued the obsessive Lerner.  An unlikely pairing,  yet one that had few rivals in the creation of theatrical songs.  Lees'  readable, in-depth portrait of Lerner and Loewe is a fascinating,  well-written book that is more than worth reading.	2000-08-01

Meryle Secrest's book is one of a kind (so far): a story of Stephen Sondheim, the man, rather than simply Stephen Sondheim, the artist.  No other book has attempted to do this, and Secrest does a fine job.  This  book is an absolute feast for Sondheim fans, because the Great Man himself  reveals several illuminating insights into his own life, conflicted  personality and peerless work.  I read the other reviews here at Amazon,  and people seem to be missing the point--this isn't a critical biography,  but a personal one.  And it is one of the very best books written about  this enigmatic, thoroughly fascinating man.	2000-07-24

What Stanley Kauffmann is to film criticism, Virgil Thomson was to music criticism--with one major difference: Thomson is himself a major artist within his critical area, classical music. While Thomson was one of the significant classical composers of his era, his name is perhaps more famous courtesy of his music criticism, which, like his music, is straightforward, erudite, graceful and concise. From the early 40s until the early 50s, Thomson was the most important music critic writing in English, and this rare collection is the finest compilation ever assembled of his reviews, essays, portraits and memoirs. Thoroughly annotated, this is the best place to start for those interested in acquainting themselves with one the finest essayists in our language.	2000-07-13

Regardless of your feelings about either Muhammad or the NOI, he's worth a well-written, honest, balanced biography, but this isn't it. That book is &quot;An Original Man: The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammad&quot; by Claude Andrew Clegg III--well-written, well-researched, intelligent, honest and balanced.
