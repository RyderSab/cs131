It is the only thorough, comprehensive, wide-ranging work of its kind.  He writes with great flair and sense of humor.  He does everything you would like to see in such a work, giving etymologies in Old Savic, the other Slavic langauges, and links to other European langauges including English.  Sort of a Polish OED on a smaller scale.  It replaces the badly outdated Bruckner.  There is a second volume in print, but unfortunately Prof. Bankowski will be unable to finish the third volume due to illness.	2005-10-11

Many other books cover the topics in greater depth.  For example, there is no mention of becoming more involved with groups such as churches, many of which thrive in proportion to the time which retired people like my wife and me donate to them.  Forty per cent of the pages cover retirement places, which is not the main goal for most retirees. Buy it cheap and move on to books specializing in medical or financial issues.  A chirpy pop psych introduction is no substitute for a serious discussion of the real issues involved.  Definitely for people with pensions and professions.  Invest in a retirement seminar instead.  Or that 40lk.	2005-08-01

I'm not in it.  The author's life is focused on both books and teaching, and this tale certainly reflects that.  If you like vampire stories, gothic novels, and multi-layered suspense stories where you know from the first page where it is heading and love the ride, by all means buy it and read it.  The publisher has invested over two million dollars in The Historian and Hollywood will film it.  It could have used a potted history of the Ballkans and the impact of the Turkish invasion, the role of the Greek Church (Cyril of Cyril and Methodius is there) and the conflicts with Islam which she mentions in scattered references.  A couple of historical maps would have helped with context on a most obscure part of Europe. If you are bitten by Bela Lugosi and the Dracula theme, this is a must buy.  Otherwise, skip it.	2005-07-12

Clumsy writing, plowing through chatty verbiage to get to the main points, not up to the usual high standard of the Teach Yourself series I have been using for years. A combination of assertions and questions leave me puzzled as to the intended audience.  Could have used a good editor to sharpen in on all fronts.	2005-06-21

This book describes some aspects of their experience, mainly fascinating domestic incidents well worth preserving.  Unfortunately, the book lacks a scene-setting introduction or epilogue to place her story in Eastern European and Midwestern history.  What happeened to Sopie and her family after these events?  Who are the others mentioned in the acknowledgements?  The Rachel Calof memoir, which closely parallels this one, is a model of its kind and can be highly recommended.	2005-03-22

The advice is generally commonsensical, assessing each partner's preferences and goals, and getting about enjoying retirement especially for an educated, healthy, professional audience. Unfortunately, it is short on advice for developing interests after a lifetime of work, such as getting training in a new field, which could have made a bibliography quite valuable.  For those who remarry in retirement, there is nothing about our issues we face, which are similar to any newly married couple, namely, adjusting to a new person in the house, children, pets, likes and dislikes.  This is mainly for couples together for 20 or 30 years.  It is a good start in an unexplored field and is easy to read and search out useful ideas.	2005-02-23

I ordered the system based on the writeup in the New York Times.  At least I can save the $40 price by ordering books from Amazon.com.  First, I could not open the CD-ROM, but apparently the program is not useful.  Second, book's main virtue is as a general discussion of book cataloguing and organizing, best suited to a collector of fine books rather than someone (like me) who buys too many and needs to find them at home, rather than duplicating an academic library setting. For the basis of my collection's organization I used The Reader's Catalog.  It works great because of its index to over 40,000 books, a well thought-out plan, and the convenience of being a paperback book with complete bibiographic data on the books. Why type in an ISBN when they are easily available from Amazon or in a book like the Catalog?	2005-02-16

This is not a detailed analysis of the works themselves.  Rather, it summarizes currently scholarly thinking and reviews the main trends in Mozart studies, with brief comments on major works, a bibilography, and extensive footnotes with citations pointing toward further study and research.  Highly recommended as a supplement to other standard works.  Especially fascintating is the discussion of the role of the movie \\"Amadeus\\" in stimulating interest in him.	2004-09-25

It is a collection of impressions and interviews with successful cheerful retired professionals, rather than a hard look at our choices and how to make major decisions on jobs, families, finances, health, and spiritual well-being. Her subjects are uniformly propserous, well-educated, self-aware, and articulate.  It reads like an expanded article from the Washington Post, and since the author is a Post writer there, no wonder.  Lawyers and doctors are her featured subjects.  Some of the books and studies she cites may be worth pursing, but it is hard to tell.  This book fills its market niche, but a wider audience could use a more comprehensive and analytic guide to these potentially productive and enjoyable years, as another reviewer puts it.  This it reads like Gail Sheehy for 2004.	2004-07-13

All British and thousands of students overseas follow this standard curriculum on the basics of written classical music.  It is a well-organized introduction to the basic elements of standard diatonic harmony and musical structure.  It accompanies an eight-part syllabus of amplified instruction, musical examples, and thorough instructions on how to pass the ABRSM standardized tests given for each level.  It is most valuable used in conjunction with the course, since it is densely written and in a compact format, so the other course materials are necessary to make the most of it.  It is invaluable preparation for the standardized ABRSM music tests, but has limited usefulness as a standalone text.	2004-06-02

Its major virtue is to tell obsessive parents to let their burgeoning adults take more control of their lives than they are willing to grant.  For the parents of a teen with unresolved issues, or one with a clear idea of how to handle college admissions and their lives in general, the book is silent.  The major point is:  Back off, parents.  If you are not a parent who needs this message of allowing kids to find their own path, you may find it without much utility.	2004-05-16

He assumes you know something of classicla music and the difference between flats, sharps, and minor and major scales.  As a self-taught musical enthusiast, now working with an experienced teacher, I love this approach--copious examples, enthusiastic style, thorough explanation of basic principles.  Get both volumes.  (Piston and the others are pendantic and dull, too dense and hard to follow, or too simplistic.) The workbooks are of less value and need a professional to provide most of the material for exercises.	2004-04-10

The most notable omission is the lack of discussion of Jewish experience outside the Middle East except for Spain, North Africa, Ethiopia, China, and Cochin.  There is nothing about the great migration of Jews into the tolerant Polish Commonwealth, so there is nothing about the role of Jews in Eastern Europe until Zionism and anti-Semitism spring up in the nineteenth century.  He describes the destruction of the Jewish communities in Poland, but how did they get there and what was their anthropology?  I bought the book to find out, but there was nothing.  Also, his footnotes and bibliography make no reference to sources that place this vital topic in a wider historical context, as a general history of Eastern Europe or even of Jews in the Habsburg Monarchy, for example, or Russia.  What is the culture that gave us Freud, Marx, and Mahler?  Nothing on that. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a refuge for Jews from Western Europe.  Nohting on that.  This is definitely not a book for the general reader.	2004-01-24

For the amatuer wanting a well-designed guide to develop an understanding of how classical music works, this is by far the best.  The steps are clear and logical, the exercises just what the learner needs, and the accompanying book of music examples a highly advisable purchase.  You could do this on your own without a guide, given the fact that the materials have been tested in the classroom.  The bibliography is also useful, if for nothing else than to show you why this vademecum is the most user-friendly and helpful.	2003-08-08

He has no axes to grind, and explains clearly how the many ethnic groups and their main oppressors sharpened theirs by adapting western concepts of nationalism and group identity, shifted these powerful ideas from an intellectual elite to the masses, and helped bring about the horrors of two world wars and the current mess in the Balkans.

It is a model of its kind, unique in scope, shows a mastery of multiple langauge sources, and is a scholarly yet readable account of the history of the largest European country of its day, the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealthy of 1569.  Prof. Snyder's account is masterly, even-handed, and scrupulously fair with a clear and valuable thesis.  It brings the complex strands of a neglected part of Europe into focus and explains while Poland and its Eastern neighbors were able to reach a peaceful accommodation after the downfall of the soviet Union.  Tragically, the Balkans did not enjoy the longterm fencebuilding that kept this corner of the world at peace.  Snyder's account of the Polish-Ukrainian conflicts during World War II is groundbreaking and fills a vital gap in this story.  Not since &quot;God's Playground&quot; has the story been told so well.

Schonberg; Structure: short introductory essays on the composers and major pieces; more performances included and rated, including deleted ones; reviews flow in a standard paragraph format, rather than having discography information at the head of each collection of performances; easier to find a single work in the haystack.  There is no discernable American or British bias, but it does omit, for example, both Daniel and Sidney Jones.  Best would be to buy BOTH as happy complements to each other.

Nothing of political role or organizational issues with the Austro-Hungarian, Russian and German multi-ethnic armies and their impact on the fighting and eventual collapse of the three empires.
