Zane Grey was my first western author. After reading one book as a young teen, I began to read all his books.

We identify immediately with middle-aged Jo as she tells us about her life both present and past. We understand her frustrations and her secret thoughts and desires. And as she deliberately brings her past into the present, we wonder about the wisdom of her choice as she plunges into a relationship that might destroy all she cares about now. I worried about her and wondered how it would all end. The novel hold attention and interest. (However, I doubted Jo's freedom of choice, for in reality, she would have had to be more involved with her husband's church ministry than she was in the novel. It seemed his vocation was one in which she shared little with him,and this is not true of minister's wives I have known who must serve equally with their husbands.)<BR>Evelyn Horan - author<BR>Jeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three	2003-06-19

What an interesting and insightful read into the views of a &quot;younger man&quot; who later became an honored Pulitzer prize winner! As a native Texan, about McMurtry's age, I can recall a l960's Texas.  He has treated his account with wit, energy, honesty and humor! I loved every page of the book and found myself chuckling at life the way it once was in the Lone Star state. As some have mentioned, it would be interesting to have a modern-day follow up of the Texas of today, but perhaps since Mr. McMurtry has now chosen to return to his roots, in Archer City, leaving the Eastern cities to other folks, he might be completely satisfied and comfortable with life as it in his small hometown in rural Texas where on each corner of the town square, he has placed a sizeable bookstore housing rare and collectable books, his legacy to future generations of Texans and others interested in such matters.

Not only have I read the series, I also have them on audio tape and listen to them constantly, over and over again. McMurtry's characters are alive and are our friends.
