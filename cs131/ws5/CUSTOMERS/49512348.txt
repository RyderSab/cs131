US	49512348	R1OJDQ0WLI96Y0	0738705977	422879767	Gay Tarot (English and Spanish Edition)	Books	5	37	38	N	N	Deep, modern, colorful, empowering	I have had an interesting journey with this deck.  When I first got this deck I projected what I wanted in a gay tarot deck onto it instead of fully allowing the cards to speak for themselves.  With any themed tarot deck there is always a feeling for the fans of whatever particular theme is being used that the creator makes some glaring omissions/mistakes/blunders and that. With the monumental task of creating a deck that will touch people at a very personal level, I feel that Lee Bursten and Antonella Platano have created a cohesive deck that is accessible to people of all levels of tarot experience.    The art: As is common with decks by Lo Scarabeo the artwork in the Gay Tarot is what American tarot readers would call \\"comic bookish\\".  The illustrations are slightly \\"cartoonish\\" without ever looking silly.  The style actually reminds me quite a bit f the artwork of Joe Phillips, my favorite gay artist.  Platano does lovely work with color and the deck is primarily made up of soft jewel tones.  There is a light dreamlike quality to most of the cards.    The setting: The deck is set in a very modern world, other than the Guides all of the cards depict scenes that could be easily encountered by a contemporary reader.  There is little overt occult symbolism but Bursten and Platano have cleverly inserted many little nods to traditional tarot imagery in creative ways that do not upset the setting (the four suit symbols appear on a curtain behind the Magician, a crocodile appears on a blimp fling above the Fool).  Of all of the attempts at a modern setting in a tarot deck that I have seen this one does the best job of creating scenes which are both familiar but also profound and complex.    The Courts: The courts are Youth, Man, Guide, and Sage.  Traveling through the court we see a progression of gay men's lives and experiences.  The youth shows us at our most buoyant and awkward stage.  The Men show us making our mark on the world.  The Guides are winged nude spirits/angels/faeries in four different races.  I believe they connect the Men to the Sages by representing the spiritual awareness that takes place between before consciousness/self actualization.  The Sages show gay men in the dusk of their lives, profound elders we can look to for guidance.    The Gay: For a very long time gay readers have had a handful of unofficial gay decks.  The Renaissance (Williams), Light and Shadow (Goepferd), and especially the Cosmic Tribe Tarot have a lot in the way of queer symbolism but it is subtle and involves a lot of reading between the lines.  Bursten was the first non-erotic deck to to \\"come out of the closet.\\"  There are men in this deck that some people feel represent stereotypes (theater for example).  Otehr folsk (admittedly myself at first, thought needed a bigger dose of \\"gay.\\"  But like us the deck is as gay as it is meant to be and doesn't need to be more or less so to please anyone.  The deck is also racially the most diverse deck on the market next to the World Spirit Tarot and also showcases more middle aged and elderly figures than any deck I have ever seen.  Bursten has claimed that he wished for the deck to be a spiritually empowering deck for gay men in the way that the Motherpeace deck was for women and many men will be able to find themselves in these cards (and quite possibly some may not).    A very readable deck - and that's what ultimately counts.	2005-07-12
US	49512348	R33NXMKEJ7U88S	0007164653	507547026	The Element Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts	Books	5	24	27	N	N	The Mother of All Spellbooks	I am picky about spellbooks so when I saw this one on the shelf I was sure that it had to be terrible.  A collection of 5,000 spells was just too much for me to believe that there was any real value to the book.  I was sure that at very least it would just list a bunch of spells with no real information about how to work with them.  I opened the book at random and came to the chapter on working with herbs.  I was very surprised to read a detailed account of creating herbal infusions that matched up with an herb class I had recently taken.  Upon further inspection I found that there was a plethora of supplemental information for nearly every section in the book.    One great aspect of the book is the way the spells are organized.  Most (smaller) books will have a section labeled \\"Protection\\" and list a handful of spells on the topic most of which the reader will never (for various reasons) implement.  In this book under Justice spells it begins with the most accessible, least involved spells \\"(Burn brown and purple candles) and then steadily increases the level of involvement (here's an oil you can make to anoint those candles).  Many spells have a handful of various versions to try out.  The famed \\"beef tongue\\" justice spell has 8 different versions including one for vegetarians.      There is a wonderful mix of traditional customs, vodoun, ancient formulas, herbal, candle, oil, sympathetic, entity summoning, and just about everything you can think of.  Now, obviously I would imagine that Ms. Illes has not personally cast all 5,000 of these spells but I got the impression that she had a nice level of familiarity with the material.      And on a purely aesthetic level it feels very nice to pull a gigantic spellbook off the shelf and start flipping through its pages.  After owning this one for about a month I bought copies for each member of my coven.	2005-07-07
US	49512348	R26REXNLU1KTFC	0758206178	361062878	The Trouble Boy	Books	3	6	8	N	N	fun, contemporary, shallow	I worry whenever a main character in a book is compared to Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye.  This often means the book will be the angsty stream of consciousness philosophy of a person who thinks they are more complex than they really are.  Toby (probably an alter ego for the author TOm dolBY), Trouble Boy was quite a bit more fun and less pretentious than that but the book did fall short in a couple of places for me.    I got the book mainly because the main character was my age an it was NOT a coming out novel.  It is nice to encounter a story where the main character has moved beyond that overused stage of life.  Toby is easy to relate to for many gay 20-somethings, he's in the scene but not obsessed with it, he has a group of friends who can be as challenging as they can be supportive, he's a little shallow (I think most guys are to some degree no matter how much we might protest).  There were many scenes with which I could immediately relate.  However, at times, it was a little hard to feel sympathy for a Yale graduate at 22 living on his own in Manhattan, in an apartment paid for by his affluent parents, who can afford to go out drinking nearly every night of the week.  When he says he probably wouldn't have dated a guy if he knew he worked in retail it put me off a bit.    In its favor there are many fun chapters especially those revolving around the foppery of the social elite and the book is quite the page turner; flaws aside I couldn't put it down until I was finished.	2005-03-04
US	49512348	R36PZVMHF8F8PA	1567185002	668940814	The World Spirit Tarot	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A beautiful deck	The World Spirit is a truly beautiful deck and one that gives the clearest readings.  Here's Why:  The Art - really stands out from other decks.  The block print style makes for beautiful deep black lines and jewel-like colors.  The colors are bright and vibrant but without being hard on the eyes.  With some bright decks when you lay out more than three cards everything seems to swim and it's hard to make anything out.  This deck has a nice balance and I haven't had trouble in this arena.  The Diversity - This is the mother of all diverse decks.  Some diverse decks have an African suit and a Japanese suit etc, or feature the occasional ethnic person.  Here you have every flavor of person sprinkled evenly throughout the deck.  Also, where some decks make the same outline for every person and just use different crayons to color them in this one really this one makes everyone look like members of their race.  Also there are a number of cards that feature folks of different races playing, very rare.  The Courts: Courts are Seer, Seeker, Sibyl, Sage, follows the system where the court levels are different ways of experiencing the suit's element.  The whole deck is element heavy and will work well for people who relate to the cards in this way.  Will be nigh impossible for those who have a wands/air, swords/fire outlook.	2004-07-29

I've been following this series from the beginning and some of the books were quite fun but this one was difficult to get through (and it's not that long).  My first issue was that the main troupe of characters is entirely made up of fighters.  A human fighter, an elf fighter, a dwarf fighter, and a dwarf fighter cleric.  Having Mialee or Lidda around usually helped the books... anything for a little more variety.  Jozan the cleric makes a cameo in the beginning and returns and we know Naull will appear at some point... but when you get four fighters as the party you can be assured that there will be some hack and slash on its way.  As to the fights... Lain writes a very interesing fight with folks feinting and ducking and blades nicking or pommels hammering... but there were a few too many of these just in the first few chapters.  I'm still going to read the last book as I'm hoping this one just didn't come together.	2004-01-31

It begins at the beginning (Gaia and Uranus), chronicles the Titans, the major Olympian gods, \\"minor\\" gods, and heroes.  The stories flow chronologically and the authors make many references back to earlier sections without any confusion.<br />The stories are told at a beginner level but without a feeling that a lot is missing from them as can happen in Edith Hamilton's Mythology.  The art is appealing and nervous parents will be pleased to know that the pictures are at an appropriate level for young people.  Also som of the more risque sections are dealt with without omitting important information.  In the story of Perseus, Zeus does the Golden shower of light transformation to appear in Danae's room and she becomes his bride.  Cute isn't it?<br />Just knowing the information in this one book was enough to give me an edge over fellow college students and professors (yes professors) in ancient history and humanities classes.  For some reason most of teh American public seems to get their informationon mythology from te film Clash of the Titans (a movie I guiltily enjoy by the way).	2003-10-02

Just take your other Wicca 101 books and every once in a while say \\"And gay people can do this too\\" and you will have everything this book has to offer.  It seemed almost as if he wrote a regular Wicca 101 and then sprinkled things in randomly once it had been finished.  Gay Witchcraft by Christopher Penczak looks much more promising.	2003-07-29

This deck has given me more breakthroughs than any other... and I have almost no idea why.  At fist glance it seems slightly comic bookish in style with a lot of pale white women.  Also rather than getting stuck in a pseudo-renaissance it seems to exist in all times as Julie Taymor's Titus does.<br />Some of the symbolism incorporated is just brilliant and was revealed slowly, a little at a time over a long period.  I wondered what was going on with the Ace of swords... a sword is stuck in a piece of stone work with an engraving of a strange bird-man creature devouring a fish on it.  This boggled me until one day I looked and got it, the bird (air intellect logic) devours the fish (emotion, felling, understanding) and thus the card represents a triumph of the mind over the emotions.  The otter on Temperence was a wonderful idea: a creature that can survive both on land (solidity) and water (emotion again) but has been largeley forced to retreat to the waters (emotion) when it is in danger.  I preferred not to use the little white book at all (read the first paragraph of it once) when learning with this deck, I had a much better time observing the cards on my own.  <br />I try to read with a number of decks so that I can continue to get new information from the cards but the Secret Tarot is the one I turn to when I want to know what is going on.	2003-07-21

I feel that what makes this a good beginner's book is its sense of structure and organization.  Many beginning books stress over and over again that you can do things however you wish and re-structure things as you see fit, and they aren't wrong, however I feel that it is best to see a full working model before making any alterations to suit your beliefs.  The \\"big blue book\\" is very thorough, covering many subjects without just glossing over them.  After reading this book I had a better idea of the seriousness of what I was taking on and I believe that is why I am still practicing where many friends who dipped their toes into the craft never got very far.	2003-06-24

It never claims to teach the religion of Vodou (or Vodun ore any other number of spellings) nor does it claim to align itself with Wiccan philosophy.  As a practicing Wiccan I can differentiate between spells I (personally) should and should not cast.  As to problems with karma it's not so bad, it doesn't have nearly as much baneful magic as the venerable Modern Witches Spellbook.  If you want to work with this one you should try and find access to a botanica to get many of the supplies.  If you don't want to hunt around for the more exotic herbs try The Supermarket Sorceress series, all of the ingrediants for those spells can be found at the local grocery store.  I have other spellbooks that I look to more frequently but it's nice to have something with hoodoo flavor in the collection.	2003-05-30

Regdar is still troubled over the loss of Naull and Lidda is... well Lidda, gotta love her.  The new character in this one is Sonja a druid who feels much more like a druid than Vadania did in Treachery's Wake.  <br />I liked that this story does not flash back and forth between heroes and villains, it just sticks with the party and we make discoveries as they do.  In this way you are actually surprised once in a while about what is causing the ice plague and why.<br />I did have one gripe that keeps this one from getting 5 stars and that is while Sonja uses a nice variety of different druid spells to get throught the novel Hennet seems to only know magic missile and web.  I understand that sorceres know fewer spells than wizards and priests but come on.  For example when the characters encounter a dragon he fires a magic missile at it.  Magic missile on a dragon, is that wise?  He did acquire an invisibility spell in Oath of Nerull but hasn't found a need for it in this one.  But as I said Sonja does use a lot of interesting magic.<br />There are some very interesting cold terrain monsters to be encountered in plague of ice which I liked and also two encounters with orcs and gnolls which I found tiresome.  Don't get me wrong Lain has really gotten orcs and gnolls down I just wanted something new this late in the series.<br />I was liking the dialouge quite a bit, there are a couple of memorable lines especially from Sonja.  And of course Lidda kept things lively.	2003-05-26

Hamilton wrote down absoultely everything she was thinking and then they published the book without editing it.  I liked it better than Narcissus in chains but it's still not on par with the earlier novels.<br />This one made me realize why I liked Obsidian Butterfly so much.  In that novel Hamilton got to write a story with some new characters without having to parade out every single person Anita has ever met.  Is it really necessary to bring up every living preternatural in the St. Louis area?  It felt at times that the personal lives of every wereleopard were more important than serial murders, assassins and the first vampire.<br />The sex bored me.  I like sex, I think it's ok to have sex in the novels but it should really be interesting.  And why are the gentlemen not taking on a very active roel in the foreplay?  I'm not a fan of the ardeur.  I thought it was interesting to give Anita's powers some complications but making her stop every 20 pages to have sex just so she can let off some psychic energy was too much for me.<br />It's been said before but is there any doubt in anyone's mind whether or not Hamilton likes long haired guys?  Why is every guy Anita meets described as being very close to but not quite feminine with amazing eyes and long flowing hair?  <br />All of the conversations felt like they could have been edited for brevity's sake.  There seemed to be pages and pages of unending dialouge any time Anita made any decision.  <br />I felt that the villains were underused.  Musette was billed as being Belle Morte's right hand vampire and she doesn't do much but act as a psychic surrogate for Belle Morte.	2003-04-26
US	49512348	R1TNC2TXWKRPXJ	0886773520	42355391	Magic's Pawn (The Last Herald-Mage Series, Book 1)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good Stuff	After reading all of the reviews I think most of the book's detractors focused on 4 reasons that they didn't like the book: Vanyel's whiny, gay romance, cliches, and poor writing.  <br />Yes Vanyel is whiny... but people ARE whiny.  Anyone who has ever worked in retail can tell you that people love to whine and complain.  Luke Skywalker is particularly whiny in the beginning of Star Wars (\\"But I wanna go to Tosche station\\", \\"But I CAN'T go to Alderaan\\").  Bilbo complains about he discomfort of adventuring quite often in The Hobbit.  Personally the character who is strong and capable from day one and takes every personal tragedy with a stiff upper lip and chin held high is the real cliche.  So yes Vanyel complains a lot in the beginning but like Luke and Bilbo he gets over it.<br />Some readers weren't thrilled with the gay characters.  Well sci-fi fantasy literature is chock full of heterosexual relationships.  How many romances popped up in the Dragonlance Chronicles?  Is there a female character in those books that didn't have a romance with one of the male characters?  Magic's Pawn isn't obsessed with homosexuality.  It's not a treatise on gay rights; if Tylendel had been a girl I doubt people would be so upset about the place of romance in the series.  Some readers complained that the book poses the notion that gay people are born gay.  Well folks I hate to break it to you but some of us are.  <br />Some people felt that the plot was too cliched.  A LOT of sci-fi fantasy is cliched especially if you subsribe to the Jung/Campbell idea that stories and myths are universal.  A character we liked is killed to move another character emotionally?  No way?  Yes it's been doen and a lot of peoples aw it coming but I think thaht is because people can relate to it.	2003-04-15

I work in a new age bookstore and the original Book of Spells is most often purchased by children and younger teens who look at it and are impressed by the cover and the title as if the thing was written by merlin back in the dark ages.  The book isn't going to teach spirituality but it didn't ever make that claim.  It teaches a litle bit of magical theory in it's opening chapter but I think there are better choices for successful spellcasters (I recommend Magic for the Solitary Practitioner by Nancy B. Watson.)<br />BUT... after you've been doing all of the regular candle spells and seasonal rites for a while and coming up with your own stuff and working with divinity SOMETIMES it's fun to crack open a cute lil spellbook and try it that way.  Most magical folk I know are playful people and sometimes the idea of getting yer spells from a \\"tome\\" like this one is appealing.  Plus it looks so neat on the coffee table with the beautiful photos and well OCCASIONALLY it's fun when your non-magical friends see something like this in your house.  <br />This one is much better than its predecessor (I have, to date only felt compelled to cats one spell from the original).  The chapters are organized in a way I haven't seen before.  I am used to spells being listed either by need genre (love, prosperity, protection) or alphabetically by spell name.  Green organized them by planets, zodiac, elements, kitchen magick, dreams etc. an approach I liked.  Also the spells in this one have a LOT of room for personalization, for example a Wreath created for career success will be decorated with objects that appeal to your career choices.  Also the elemental spells are geared toward using the elements to improve other magical works and taht's always a good idea.<br />So it's a fun book for the person who already has 20 books on paganism in general, it's actually useful, and the art is great (i bought the bookoriginally just because the guy pictured in the Pluto and sweet dreams spells is pretty cute).	2002-08-08

The Icewind Dale guidebook was amazing. It had a complete walkthrough that took you through all of the little nooks and crannies of the game and separate sections for every item type and creature you can find/encounter.<br />The main section of this book is vague journal entries that are intended to take you throught the major plot moments. This was an awful idea as a typical entry reads something like \\"We hurried through the cavern encountering countless skeletons, spiders, and mercenaries\\". That will get you nowhere! If you're reading the guide you wanna know what corridors you will walk down and exactly who you will encounter.<br />The main narrative ignores almost all of the little subquests in the game. If you don't take on a good number of these quests your characters aren't going to have the experience you will need to beat the game. The section on subquests is nearly indecipherable.<br />The most inexcusable sin committed by this guide is it's horrible maps. The maps are not no help at all. The map of the sewers in Baldur's gate will not tell you what you will find in any given room or corridor.<br />I usually buy the guidebook for any rpg i play just to make life a little simpler, this book was no help at all. the game's non-linear setup would be challlenging for any writer but they coudl have at least labelled the maps!	2002-07-13

It has everything a sci-fi fantasy fan is looking for: it has an epic scale, a beautiful setting that has many ties to welsh myth and characters that really grow as the saga progresses.  I loved each of the books and have re-read them several times.  I owuld even venture to say I liked these book seven more than sertain other books dealing with hobbits and rings.

If every book had the same Anita not really being affected by everything that happened to her it would get really dry really fast.  Series like that spend all of their time developing the villains because they are the only dynamic parts of the story.  <br />There has been a build in the last couple of novels where Anita has noticed thaht she has become more and more comfortable with killing.  She was genuinely bothereed that she was having less and less resistance to taking life and I for one wondered if she really was becoming a sociopath.  The issue was dealt with heavily in this book and I was relieved that all of this building wasn't for nothing.<br />For a little while i was felt like Anita no longer lives in the real world.  As others have said she deals more with the monsters now than humans.  This too was dealt with well, as we see that the spooky folks can't just have huge fights in the middle of suburbia.   <br />Why not 5 stars?  Ok I like the sex scenes, I think it's great but it seemed like every one was identical, in the end i was skipping over the pages and pages of everyones power spilling over each other.  The fight scenes and sex scenes are great and all but I needed just a little more variety.<br />This is a great step in Anita's saga and everyone who's been following her should read this one.	2002-03-15

Illness, Ward Off Evil Spirits and Much More	Books	1	8	17	N	N	Someone please turn this woman into a frog!	While this was probably the best (and by that I just mean this one wasn't full of death spells the author had never tried before or references to God's wrath against homosexuals) I don't think it's a very good spellbook.  Many of the bad reviews come from the more conservative Wiccans but I would say that even if you are a non-wiccan this book is useless.  Even if you are ok with delving a litle into the dark side (not everyone believes in the rule of three) there are better books out there that deal with this.  Embracing The Moon by Yasmine Galenorn was a great book that included sexually charged spells and spells to mete out justice.  The only peple who might like this bok are those who already have a background with either Polynesian or West African magic (but if they do they are probably ahead of Morrison's work already).	2001-06-28

Morrison's spellbooks are terrible.  I'm sure some people get her stuff to work but there are just so many better spellbooks out there.<br />I have a serious problem with some of her conservative perspectives.  This is, after all, the woman (I won't say witch) who wrote that you have to believe in Christ to be a witch.  In this book, however, Morrison included a spell to protect you from Sexually Transmitted Diseases in which she described how homosexuals were responsible for the AIDS epidemic.  She even mentions that this is because of God's clear views on homosexuality.  What?!?  So God (who apparently has the power to wipe out people in a very specific way, say the firstborn son of every household a la the tenth plague of Egypt) is going to destroy a people who have been around for thousands of years with a disease that actually infects everyone?  This is the kind of garbage I hear from Southern Baptists.  It almost makes me want to compromise my morals and start using her own vile spells against her.	2001-06-28

Bethany mentions that her dad was dating a psychologist a month ago but as I recall he was engaged to a lawyer.  The book was also pretty violent.  Now I know thath it's murder mystery but it got to the point where I couldn't buy that people were willing to accept that much violence and not need therapy.  The end is filled with bloodshed and the teens manage to take it all in stride.  I thought that the first book handled their reaction sto violence much more realistically.	2001-03-17

It wasn't as formulaic as I had feared, the main character Billy wasn't the usual confused boy next door with a heart of gold that you usually find.  Read this one after your first boyfriend dumps you.. trust me.	2001-02-17

Most Wicca 101 books come with a chapter on magick spells and Magickal Correspondences. This book basically takes that chapter and blows it up into something a little more useful.<br />However it doesn't contain any info on raisng and focusing power or using visualizations so if you don't already have a book on that (Laurie Cabot, Scott Cunningham, Silver Ravenwolf etc.) yer gonna have a recipe book. I think it makes a good companion piece to a book that teaches a specific magickal path.<br />Note: Conservative Wiccans aren't gonna like this one, it challenges the Law of 3 and the idea of not using person specific love spells. If you have serious problems with that i'd stay away from this one.	2001-02-03

The faeries are often very direct in what they want to tell you with this deck.	2000-12-18
US	49512348	R1DCIKY0O6TK42	1567183042	620514344	Embracing the Moon: A Witch's Guide to Rituals, Spellcraft and Shadow Work	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Fun	I liked this book quite a bit.  Every book on magick has the usual visualization techniques but the ones presented in this book were quite unique.  I liked her non-Wiccan status (I think that's what kept her from getting too stuffy).  This book also has a good approach to the &quot;positive-magick-only-or-else&quot; stance most books take.  Galenorn suggests ways you can deal with very negative situatons without breaking out the voodoo doll.  This book is great if you're tired of certain Wiccan authors self-righteousness.  <br />What kept this book from getting 5 stars?  Well occaisionally Galenorn forgets that men work magick too.  Some of the sections were a bit light but I think that's just her style. <br />Oh, and I really loved the book's dedication	2000-11-24
US	49512348	R1FRW177ZVXXFE	0764150987	184346775	The Book of Spells: Over 40 Secret Recipes to Get Your Own Way in Love, Work, and Play	Books	3	11	13	N	N	Nice Variety	This book has two redeeming values. <br />1) It's very pretty like others have mentioned the pictures are all very fun and magical 2) It includes spells from MANY cultures and systems.  Almost everything on the market today sticks to just one culture but this book had Celtic, Native American, German, Middle Eastern, etc.  Also the little sections on all types of magic were cute.<br />I think this book is a fun addition for someone who's getting a little tired of doing the same old thing everytime they work magic.  It spices it up a bit.	2000-11-12

Not because she has black magic in it personally I think the Wiccans need to lighten up, but because it just isn't that useful.  The spells don't lend themselves to be personalized which causes problems unless ou want exactly what the author did.  Also most of them don't really have any room to build up power and focus.  There is one excpetion.  the magic ESAU square talisman seemed to be a very interesting spell.<br />I've owned this book for about 5 years and to be honest I've never even tried one of her spells.  They might work, but it seemed easier to belnd candle magic and herbs and the like and go from there.  A lot of her spells involve visits to th ejewlery store to have things specially made.  So before you buy it flip through and ask yourself do I really see myself doing this? (be sure to check out the ESAU talisman I mentioned).	2000-11-12

Notice that the people who liked this book usually also said that it was their first book (it wasn't mine but it gave me a couple of ideas).  I would recommend this book to a beginner in magic who thinks they want to go Wiccan but also feels they want to have a Celtic flavor to their practice.  <br />No, you shouldn't read only this book and think you have celtic mythology down pat but you should NEVER read any one book on magic or Celtic history... let's say it togeteher... &quot;perspective&quot;.  I don't think Conway was trying to give you the be-all end-all book on Celtic Magic.<br />So if you're an aspiring witch who wants to put a Celtic spin on your next circle casting get this book and a couple of others and have fun.  If you want an authentic no holds barred 100% Celtic experience, get on a plane to teh British Isles.	2000-09-27
US	49512348	R2CJUANZ2UR5PC	0877288747	838022534	Practical Solitary Magic	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Very User Friendly	Most books on magic suffer from being either far too esoteric and almost arrogantly mysterious for a person to make any good sense of or so watered  down and too user friendly that they are completely devoid of any  inspiration.  I found Ms. Watson's style to be quite out of the norm.  This  is not the first book on magic I read but it is one of my favorites.  On a  practical level, I loved both this book's take on the four magical planes  and also on the elements.  On an aesthetic level I loved her conversational  and anectdotal style.  I think this book is a good read for both pagans and  ceremonial magicians and while it's not the be-all end-all of magic it has  become the cornerstone of my practice.	2000-08-05

Trhere are very few  good books for non-beginners because most books of them end up as  extravagent and overly complicated.  Ms. Ravenwolf took the basics of magic  and looked at them a littl emore deeply.  For example most practitioners  know how to summon the watchtowers but Silver disects shows you some of the  deeper meanings and then shows you how you can personalize it.  I would  recommend this for the practitioner looking for something more.	2000-08-05
US	49512348	R1GTUHTFNEN77S	157353109X	512331579	The Spell of Making	Books	3	5	12	N	N	Informative but fluffy	Blacksun stresses the need for overstatement when writing your rituals.  This makes sense for ritual purposes but unfortunately he also overstates anything he says in the book.  There are some good points in there but they  are buried unders layers of superfluous banter.  I much preferred Watson's  anecdotal approach in her Practical Solitary Magic, it just felt more real  to me and I was much more interested.  This is not the book for you if you  already understand how to make up your own rituals, it doesn't even really  help you refine the technique very much.  I'd say it's more for the person  who has immersed themselves in the religious side of the Craft and now is  taking a first side int practical magic.	2000-06-15
