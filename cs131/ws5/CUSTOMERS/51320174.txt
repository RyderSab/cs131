I especially found the chapter \\"You are not your mind,\\"<BR>inspiring. Just by reading the possibility that I am separate from the constant positive or negative thoughts I have about myself, others or situations, I felt a sense of freedom. I am able to distingish myself from my thoughts and live my life in a sincere and authentic way. Not as a result of my mind's concept but as a direct expression of whom I am. The idea that Tolle presents of how living in the present moment I am able to discover that I am complete and perfect is also truly remarkable.<br />Another inspiring book about living a meaningful life is called \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work,\\" written by Ariel & Shya Kane. Enlightenment is no longer an elusive state for a chosen few, but has become a realty for many people through insightful and practical guide books such as \\"The Power of Now\\" and \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work.\\" I highly recommend both of these books.	2002-12-06

That's right, if change didn't happen the world we live in would be lifeless.  This quick, easy to read little story is wonderful.  I appreciate the author's presentation of how to deal with change in this pleasantly simple story-telling format.  It made it easy to look at how I deal with change. <br />What came to mind when I read the section on fear was my current situation of needing to find a new tenant for a vacant apartment I have.  At first I wanted the current tenant to remain in our apartment-but realized that she needed to move on.  I am now moving with confidence in the direction of finding a new tenant.<br />If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend another book called \\"Working On Yourself Doesn't Work\\" written by Ariel & Shya Kane.  The Kanes' book is a guide for personal transformation, where the discovery of life's magic is a daily habit.	2002-09-21

Covey's book is a great guide for creating a life of your own choosing.  A life you want and not one that is run by mechanical habits.  Habits seep in when you are not paying attention to what works and what doesn't work in your life.  <br />     The Seven Habits are based on an individual's principles, not on a predetermined way of being.  I particularly liked Covey's idea of &quot;Production Capability,&quot; or PC.  In order to have anything in your life function well, say your relationships or your job, you need to pay attention to the maintance of what is producing the end results you wish to have.  Treating others or even material things with respect and care is as important as how we would like to be treated by others.   <br />     Another great source for self awareness is a book called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN&quot;T WORK&quot; written by Ariel and Shya Kane. In their book, the Kanes present life transforming definitions and experiences on such subjects as awareness, happiness, listening and personal transformation. <br />     I highly recommend both of these life-inspiring books!	2001-07-23

The simplicity and humor of this story make for an enjoyable read, while also delivering a way in which to enhance your life.  I live and work in New York, where the pace of life is constantly changing from fast to really fast.  Along with my co worker I handle the legal documents for 20 domestic and international currency traders for a major investment bank.  When my desk is piled high with tasks I need to accomplish, I sometimes forget what this book reminded me: &quot;the universe gives you only what you can handle.&quot;  Reading Spencer's book reminds me that change is something not to be over analyzed or resisted.  When I have wasted time disagreeing with my work the result was that I became stressed out over the thought that I would never be able to complete my tasks! The way out of my maze at work was to look at what needed to be done first, do it, and then move onto the next thing.  My desk is now a source of pleasurable anticipation of additional work.  Thank You Spencer!<br />Another book I highly recommend is called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane.  The Kanes are expert guides through the maze of life where &quot;finding the cheese&quot; (i.e. satisfaction and fulfillment) becomes a moment to moment occurrence.	2000-12-14

Debbie Ford's The Dark Side of The Light Chasers has some very valuable ideas.  I found Debbie's writing to be inspiring in looking at all aspects of myself, including the ones that I thought I needed to hide from others, those being the &quot;dark shadows.&quot;  By acknowledging or &quot;owning&quot; these preceived unacceptable aspects of myself I became more aware of my true self.  In other words, I can act appropriately and not react inappropriately to situation that come up in my life.  The concept of &quot;projection&quot; where you recognize a quality in another person as being a trait that you have yourself is an interesating one I had not heard of before reading this book.  This concept has enabled me to see my own potential for greatness.  I also appreciated the sense that Debbie convened of how in each of us lies a masked solid gold treasure that can be revealed thru awareness.<br />Another book I highly recommend reading is called 'WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane.

The timing of my reading this book could not have been better.  My husbad  &amp; I recently moved into a new home and I have used this wonderful book  in organizing our new living space.  Many people have used Ms.  Morgenstern's system to successfully organize their existing home and/or  office, while I have used it to create order in our new home, office,  laundry room, etc.  In setting up our home using Ms. Morgenstern's system,  I have also gained more self confidence.  I can quickly locate items I  need, where in our previous home, I would have had to look for them and  ultimately second guess where I had placed them before finding my keys,  notes, cell phone.  <br />Another book I highly recommend that has facilitated  a greater sense of self confidence in me, is called 'Working On Yourself  Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This book is similar to Ms.  Morgenstern's system where the basis of transformation in your living space  is not based on &quot;problem solution&quot; but in seeing what is true for  how you work or live in your office or home and seeing what works and  doesn't work for you without judging what you find.  In that sense you are  able to create lasting ease in your life as well as in your office.  I  highly recommend reading these insightful books for anyone interested in  creating an easy, satisfying and efficient life for themselves.	2000-09-14

I am an investment banker  living and working in New York, and have a great life which at times has  disappointments.  I particularly found encouragement in how Lance chose to  see his illness as part of his life and not as a departure point from  living and enjoying his life, bicycling, family and friends.<br />If you  enjoyed this book, I recommend you read another great book called  &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This  book has facilitated a consistency in all areas of my life as being  rewarding and satisfying.  Both these books are full of insights into how  to enjoy the uphill as well as the downhill on your bike ride, where you  are the winner over the finish line of your life!   ps If you like audio  tapes check out the Kanes' &quot;The Roots of Satisfaction&quot; it's  great.	2000-09-06

A WONDERFUL BOOK! <br />The Kanes' book was easy to read, fun and life transforming. One of the many miraculous transformation I have seen in my life after reading this book, is of my relationship with my husband as being one of a constant fight to one of love, fun and satisfaction. <br />And yes I agree with the recommender that this book is a must read for anyone who wants to have all their relationships and life be great.	2000-05-12
