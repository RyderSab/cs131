US	52992299	RP4PFBP1EMWUX	0471355143	160219119	How I Trade for a Living	Books	5	6	9	N	Y	Highly Recommended	As a number of reviewers before me mentioned, this is a terrific book that belongs in every trader's library. It is that good, and is easy reading. You will probably want to read it more than once just to get all of the concepts down.<br />While reading Gary Smiths book, a light went on in my head. He mentions somewhere that approximately 90 per cent of new traders don't make it. Another words, less than 10 out of 100 people who set out to do day trading wind up making consistent money (a profit). This ratio is very close to the number of people who don't make it (or don't even try) to be self-employed - about 94%<br />Think about this: 94% of the working U.S. population, is employed for the other 6%. Why is that?  It's because most of us are not taught as children to think for ourselves. Our schools teach us to obey the rules and prepare us for a career or trade working for an established company (i.e. someone else). At our job, we are usually given instructions on what needs to be done, when it is due, and in some cases, how to do it. Nothing wrong with that, but this training can work against you if applied to the stock market. <br />Day trading, is very much a self-directed profession. It requires you to make ALL decisions. There is no one to tell you  when to start, when to stop, what securites to buy or how to buy them or especially how many to buy. In Gary's book he discusses all of these topics in detail, but not in a general way.<br />Is it any mystery that so many don't succeed? I believe, that in order to be a good trader, even if you are working for a trading firm, you must have a self-employment mindset. Most of us do not.<br />I recommend reading the following book along with Gary Smith's book in order to learn those ideas that were not taught to us when we were young. Reading this book will improve the odds of success significantly for traders just starting out and who have not previously run their own operation.<br />The book is &quot;Secrets of Self-Employment&quot; by Sarah and Paul Edwards. Amazon.com carries this title ISBN 0874778379. This book will help you establish the right mindset for working on your own. These two books alone are not going to make you a super trader, but they are a very good start.	2004-07-16

Yes X-Rays do carry a certain amount of risk, and an intelligent person should weigh the harm X-Rays and other forms of radiation might do, against the benefit one will receive from the prescribed treatment. Your doctor probably will not tell you about this book, its contents, or the dangers of low level radiation.<br />The book is very well written and can be understood by someone with a good high school education. It was designed for the layman as well as individuals in the medical and legal professions. I recommended it to anyone who is concerned about their long term health and who wishes to understand the risk of getting cancer from any form of ionizing radiation.<br />Note that the reviewer is an Engineer.	2003-11-16

A very good starting point for those who have heard about Hayek and his ideas, but are not ready to jump into the details of his other works.

This is true whether we are at peace or at war. The President of the United States is the commander and chief of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. Our federal government's MAIN job is to protect us and our property from harm.<br />It is clear that many of the mistakes Bill Clinton made, were due to his lack of training in and early disrespect for the U.S. Armed Forces. How can we expect a 60's hippie protester turned lawyer, to recognize the signs of impending danger, and make correct strategic decisions? Bill missed many clues along the way because he simply did not have the required experience with defense related issues, and therefore was unsuitable for the office of President. This is in addition his aledged lack of moral fiber.<br />This book documents in clear form the many errors in judgement which the Clintons made, and how they affected the events which hurt our country, and caused thousands of Americans to die needlessly.<br />The book is written in a easy to read style and is interesting all the way thru.

He refers to it in other terms.<br />He completely neglects to mention that the main source of ideas for the US Constitution was Christian beliefs as interpreted by John Locke, an English Philosopher and Scholar, although he mentions John Locke in passing.<br />Don't waste your money.

Mr Buchanan explains it in clear English. More importantly, he successfully connects all of the dots for you concerning many seemingly unconnected events which have taken place in the United States and elsewhere. There are plently of references cited in the back of the book if you wish to check his assertions out for yourself.<br />For example: Did you know that the \\"Frankfort School\\", formerly located in Germany, which was an ultra left wing Marxist school, has relocated to New York City at Columbia University? They are alive and well in 2002.<br />This book is literally flying off the shelves in every bookstore including Amazon.com for a good reason - It pulls back the covers  and exposes the bedbugs who have been among us (and still are) for the last four decades.<br />Whether you are a Republican or Democrat, whether you like Mr. Buchanan or not, you will find that his book is informative, and well written.

The medical industry is a business, just like any business, that depends on people being sick for their money. Same story for the pharmacutical industry.<br />Is it not strange that their are so few doctors practicing preventative medicine? Why - because there is NO MONEY in it!<br />Is is not strange that the medical industry has been working on curing cancer for almost 70 years, using billions and billions of taxpayer dollars, and the problem just keeps getting worse. The cure rate is no better than it was in 1935, despite what you may read in the newspaper.<br />The info in Barrett's book is pure garbage. If you wish to prove that to yourself, look at the many fine books Amazon sells on Vitamins, written by MD's and PHD's. People like Lester Packer, a top biochemist, he does his own research - see \\"The Antioxidant Miracle\\". Look at any of the many books Amazon sells on Biochemistry. For example, \\"Harper's Biochemisry\\". It is not light reading, but a quick scan thru it will show the most casual observer just what those vitamins and minerals actually do to preserve your health, and why the body needs them. You would die fairly quickly if certain vitamins were removed completely from your diet.<br />Vitamins and minerals alone will not cure disease but it is very clear from reading any biochemistry book that they will help prevent it from occuring in the first place.<br />Check it out for your self and don't believe Mr. Barretts lies.	2002-04-13

Ignore the comments about the style of writing etc. The style could have been a little better but this is not the important issue. The information contained here is of significant value and it is based on good science (in my opinion). If you care about your health and long term survival then buy this book, read it carefully, and follow Dr. Packer's advice. Your medical doctor will probably not tell you about this new information but he is no doubt, following it himself at home. By the way, Dr. Packer is a Phd., not an MD. What is not stated in the book but I'm sure Dr. Packer is aware of is that there is new research which suggests that many presently incurable diseases are caused by certain types of viruses, bacteria, and fungus. These microbes are too small to see with an ordinary microscope (while they are alive), and are dead when viewed under an electron microscope. The process by which they work has been missed up until recently. New techniques are available now which allows microbiologists to see and study how these organisms work, and this is beginning to create new science. New science in any field takes a long time to be accepted by many practitioners for various reasons. You will not hear about this on the evening news or in your local paper, probably for another 5 to 10 years. If you want to learn more about it, you must study it yourself. For more info see Dr. Mattman's book on &quot;Cell Wall Deficient Forms&quot;, 2000, available on Amazon.com. Also, see Dr. Gregory's book, Pathogenesis of Cancer, 1955, out of print but may be available from Amazon.com Zshops or Auctions. This book shows that this subject has been around for awhile (and is highly controversial). Another good one is &quot;The Cancer Microbe&quot;, by Cantwell, 1990, available on Amazon.com. These three books explain what is going on with the germs while Dr. Packer's bookexplains what you can do to help prevent disease. There is strong evidence that Antioxidants do help. The key to controlling the microbes before they cause trouble is to have a strong immune system. One way to have a strong immune system is to counteract oxidation of our cells and provide them with proper nutrition. This can be accomplished with a very specific mix of Antioxidant vitamins which work as a team, a bit of exercise, and some common sense. Dr. Packer tells you exactly how to do this and why, and it is not complicated. I do not know Dr. Packer or anyone affiliated with him, but would like to meet him someday. The only thing missing from the book is what to do about taking other vitamins and minerals, which are not Antioxidants, in conjunction with Dr. Packer's mix. This is however, a minor detail.

This book is powerful because it begins with what scientists call first principles. First principles are the starting point where scientists begin to analyze new ideas or explain complex phenomena they have recently witnessed in the laboratory. The authors are not scientists, but philosophers, and perhaps without realizing it, they are using a similar approach.<br />This book is fundamental.<br />The book explains what has gone wrong with America in the last 50 years, but explains it with a high level discussion. High level means that the book takes a very general approach which can apply to many different problems or topics, and leaves out some details that are available in other works. Relativism is an abstract topic, but Beckwith and Koukl make it easy to understand.<br />If you are interested in political issues, social issues, IQ issues, racial issues or even education, this book will give you the foundation to understand some aspects of those topics that you will not see mentioned elsewhere, even in the well known books on these subjects. <br />The book is written by religious people, however most the discussion is not about religion. Read it and ignore the religious discussions if that subject does not interest you. It is still worth the time and effort as it contains a valuable message.<br />Relativism started with Kant and Hegel's ideas and has now permeated American society. It has gone unnoticed because it came thru the back door very slowly, a little at a time. This book will teach you to recognize it when it's about to slap you in the face.	2001-04-14

You might be surprised at the list. <br />He mentions Hayek, a Nobel Laureate in Economics, and how his work is related to the Libertarian ideas. What is interesting is that Libertarian principles are mostly common sense, are built into the U.S. Constitution already, and are consistent with Judio-Christian teachings for the most part.<br />You cannot go wrong by buying and reading this book. I predict that many people will be talking about this subject in the next 1 - 2 years. If you liked this book, you might also want to order Hayeks book titled &quot;The Return to Serfdom&quot;. <br />If you think that our country is begining to smell like a Socialist state, with the endless welfare handouts in one form or another, high crime rates, and government spending taking a larger and larger cut of your salary (currently 47% overall), then this book and others like it (there are several others on Amazon.com) are especially important reading.	2001-01-31

Apparently, the previous three reviewers lack the  education and/or  mental wherewithal to objectively write about someone  else's writings.

It is an introductory level work which assumes that the reader is  starting with a limited knowledge about buying stocks. Yes it does contain  a number of appendixes, but the information is useful if you don't already  have it, and it is all in one place. There is a list of on-line brokers,  sources of information and so on. There is useful information about how to  get started in day trading.

For those of you who are targeting long term results exclusively, you may want to look elsewhere.  What I liked about the book, is that the articles are very specific, and  they follow the format of A. Here is my idea for a model, B. This is how I  tested it, and C. Here are my results, with plots. Some of the book is easy  reading while other articles are more difficult and require some knowledge  of calculus and probability. Most of the articles assume some knowedge of  statistics. The writers and editors are well known in their field. Some are  professors from business schools, others are from investment comapanies,  and some are have an engineering or physics background. No lightweights  from what I can tell.<br />If you are serious about modeling the market using  your computer (and making money on your investments) then this book may  help you do that. It is a serious book for academically oriented  individuals. It has none of the fluff usually contained in consumer  targeted books (aka - get rich tomorrow with my new stock picking plan...).  One thing I didn't like about it is the smaller print on some of the  articles, but this was not a big factor in my decision to buy it.

It is well written. This authors style is not the usual page after page of formulas. He explains the meaning of the equations. The  authors other books are worth a look. Highly recommended.	2000-02-15
US	52992299	R2PDQ5XT9WLW3H	0130821829	396729943	Business Data Communications and Networking: A Modular Approach	Books	5	2	4	N	N	High Quality Material	I recently purchased this book to learn about networking, various protocols, OSI layers etc. Mr Panko does a very nice job of explaining difficult concepts in a way that makes them easy to understand. Every  author who writes a book on a popular topic, choses to emphasize some areas  and deemphasize others. For this reason, I usually buy at least 2 books on  a given subject in order to get greater coverage of the subject. Sometimes  I buy 3. <br />For a more technical discussion of some of the  areas covered  in this book, I purchased &quot;Data and Computer Communications&quot; by  Stallings, 5 Ed. This book appears to be written more for EE's and CS  people. It is also a very well written book. <br />I would recommend Mr.  Panko's book for a first reading of the subject and perhaps one of  Stallings, or Tannenbaum for more detail in certain topics.	1999-12-12

I am using this book as part of a college course. Although the explainations are a bit wordy, it is overall a very good book. It clearly defines items such as Object Oriented Programming and all of its  components, and many other topics. If you are a beginner you will read most  of it carefully. If you have some prior experience with programming, but  not visual basic, you will probably skim past parts of it. I liked the  book.	1999-09-21

Revised & Updated Edition	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A balanced presentation written for Intellegent readers	In reading some of the prior reviews, I have to wonder whether I am reading the same book as some of these other people. This book is excellent in the respect that it gives you an overview of what MAY happen, in WHAT  time frame and how you COULD prepare for it IF you choose to, depending on  your level of risk comfort. The fact that the writing style or the length  of the book are not to your liking is completely irrelevant. The point of  the book is to arm you with some facts and potential problems you may  personally face and how to deal with these issues before (and If) they  happen. It does a good job of accomplishing those goals. In engineering we  have a saying &quot;Trust but verify&quot; which could be extended to this  situation. Since we cannot verify anything but our own PCs, the best course  of action is to put a few dollars under the mattresss every week, and buy a  little more food and water just in case.	1999-07-24
US	52992299	R3MNS32TWRQE9R	0471621692	665127655	Radio Communications Concepts: Analog	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Excellent for Receiver Design Engineers	Although a bit expensive, this book very clearly explains the various topics and calculations related to the system level design of Receivers. It includes linear and non linear mixing, two chapters on noise, AM &amp; FM calculations, and three whole chapters on superheterodyne characteristics, spurious, and the intercept point concept. There are block diagrams and schematics. The math used is mostly algebra and light calculus except for the chapter on special functions. The answer to most end of chapter problems is included.	1998-07-26
