They always make you feel as if you are walking in her footsteps.  I, being an X-member of an Old Order Amish sect, was curious to see if there were any differences within her sect and mine.  I learned alot from, \\"Born Amish.\\"  For my sect was a little different-which isn't shocking when there are so many Amish sects.  I can't wait until she publishes another book.  For she is a remarkable writer.  I always recommend her books.  I also recommend, \\"My Amish Heritage\\", by Ruth Irene Garrett; and, \\"True Stories of X-Amish: Banned-Shunned-Excommunicated\\", by Ottie Garrett and Ben Garrett.	2005-03-09

Finding that her new neighbors are more than willing to lend a hand, makes her transition easier-at least for awhile. <br /> <br />I recommend it to anyone who loves a great fiction book! <br /> <br />Teresa Phillips(Sicily Yoder) <br />Author of, \\"Leaving Lancaster County.\\"	2005-03-09

I really enjoyed this book enough to pass it on to my personal assistant and bodyguard's sister.  For it really hits home.

After reading this book, I sat down and pathed out my real dreams and solid goals for my life.  I was on track for some; however, there were some that I was totally unaware of at this point in my life.  I know, according to Beck, that the transition isn't going to be paved with all roses.  However, I have created my life \\"careplan\\" and will implement it.  My situation was simular to others' lifes. For I didn't want to be a nurse; however, I was to return to my Old Order Amish sect as a \\"plain\\" nurse.  Therefore, I openly accepted my sect's \\"calling\\" for my life and finishing nursing school.  I added social work as a double major; however, my Bishop and deacon drove down to EKU and made me drop it because they felt that social workers weren't needed.  By branching out on my own as a bestselling author and business owner, I finally was gearing toward some of my life goals and purpose.  After finishing this book, I added more goals and a bigger plan.  Thanks, Ms. Beck! Your the best! <br /> <br />Sicily Yoder aka Teresa Phillips <br />Author of, \\"Leaving Lancaster County.\\"	2005-03-09

This book was a wonderfully written book that portrayed how the events behind the Amy Fisher Story unfolded.  Amy does a great job at showing her life through the eyes of a young sixteen year-old.  She explains about her falling for an older married man because he said he \\"loved her.\\"  Her mixed-up relationship with her parents and her need for love caused her to fall into a trap.

I thought I would be  a little overwhelmed with all the data mentioned; however, it was all mentioned in a clear cut way.  I was interested in this book, as I help my personal assistant market my books.  Mr. Gladwell is really correct about many things that he mentions in this book.  For, \\"word of mouth\\", is the most important marketing tool- at least for my book sales.  I sold more books that any other for my publishing house in November, 2004.  All I did was hand out business cards or tell people in stores.  The fact that, \\"who you know\\" is also correct.  For I know that my merchandising and speaking to groups in four states has me knowing more people than most.  I really think this is a great book for authors, business owners, or anyone wanting to see how our society reacts to certain things that trigger, \\"tipping points.\\" <br />Sicily Yoder aka Teresa Phillips <br />Author of, \\"Leaving Lancaster County.\\" <br />	2005-03-08

It is easy for one to absord all the negative press; however, after reading this book, one sees an innocent sixteen year-old that was taken advantage of by an older man's charm.   She fell for his charm's sweet-toned voice and false love for her.  It was this false love that made the fall of Amy Fisher.  I related to her book because I was once taken advantage of in my former Amish religion.  I know how easy it is when you are young and inexperienced in the world.  You keep hearing things like a tape-recorder.  Then they become reality.  If you want to know the real Amy, buy the book.  I also recommend her new book, \\"If I Knew Then.\\"  For Amy is now a wonderful mother and a wife. <br />Teresa Phillips, <br />Author of, \\"Leaving Lancaster County.\\" <br />	2005-03-08

This book is one that you will want to keep in your financial library or pass along to co-workers.  I even recommend it when I see people looking at financial books in the local library.  I have even had bankers tell me that they liked it so much that they bought a copy of their own.   <br />   For me, I think the story about the couple that were millionares was a moving source for me.  Although I used to be Amish, I had gotten caught up in the business world.  I wasn't watching my spending like I should have been doing.  According to Mr. Bach, watching your, \\"latte factor\\" can save thousands of dollars a year.  I saved $300.00 last month just on taking my own bottled waters and fresh salads in a cooler. Over a year's time, that will almost be enough to make my Roth IRA allowable contribution!  Lastly, none of the cuts I made in my budget were painful to me.  By basically thinking before I spend money, I can retire a millionare!

This book is an asset in today's tough job market and high use of credit cards.  I bought it for my cousins, all of whom are in their late twenties.  I wish I would have owned a copy of it when I was in college fifteen years ago.  I had no idea when I went out on  my own what a FICO score was or a retirement plan.  I was broke in no time.  I defaulted on a student loan.  Sure, its not the most positive thing to mention, being that I am an author whose books are sold on Amazon.However, my errors and comeback may be able to help many folks. It took me years to recover. I did it with the help of Suze Orman's advice.  People that aren't too sure about buying the book, think about the possible path that you or your loved-one may be going down.  Sure, our society does not like to talk about money.  But with the high divorce rate, foreclosure of homes, and defaulted loans, it is time to talk.  You will be happy that you bought the book.  I just paid off one of my student loans; am saving for retirement; and started a successful business and writing career. Suze's sound advice will help you too. Buy the book.

I have to say that being an Amish author has some advantages.  One is knowing about great books before they even hit the store shelves.  \\"The StoreKeeper's Daughter\\" is the first book in a 3-book series. As usual, Ms. Brunstetter has lively Amish characters in this series.  Her usual warmth and sweet aroma is also portrayed in this book.  The simple yet touching life of a young Amish girl is openly welcomed into our homes with every page that you turn.  A great book and a must read!  I also recommend all of Ms. Brunstetter's books.

Dave is a favorite author of mine for several reasons-all of which are portrayed in this book. Firstly, his Biblical advice can help everyone- no matter what their income is.  Not letting things control us, as well as our emotions, was a big step for me. I had to learn to not want things in stores just because I had never been to a mall when I was younger.  It is all about being content and patting yourself on the back when you are coming out ahead by driving a ten year old car; brown bagging your lunch to tuck money away; or paying with cash instead of plastic.

It takes alot of courage to tell the truth - especially if it is an addiction-related problem.  It is easy to say that you are going to share the truth; however, when it comes time to send it to the publisher, it becomes a wild animal that you fear so much. I know this because you don't want to hurt your family's feelings. I am an Amish author who actually deleted my, \\"Leaving Lancaster County\\" entirely from my hard drive before rewriting it. It took me another year to get the courage up to pour my emotions into Miriam Yoder's life.  To tell the story in a non-fiction state and include names is just remarkable to me.  She has so much zest and courage. I knew that she had been through a tough divorce; however, I did not know that she had a cocaine addiction.  The fact that she thought about killing herself really made  me sad becauae I once felt that way when two elders attacked me.  You feel isolated- all alone.  Hopefully, the book will make her aware that she is not alone. We fellow writers and her fans are here on the sidelines, cheering her on! She is such a stunning lady with great power on the screen.  A great book!	2004-10-23

I bought this book because I had a penpal from that area of the country years ago.  She was always wondering what I was reading.  Now I understand that she didn't have access to alot of the materials we have here in America.  I enjoyed the way the material was presented in a diary-like form.

I can not say that I am not addicted to Mr. Lucado's books because I am very addicted.  The reason is simple- he always has a angle that we aren't leaning toward although we should eb doing so.  In this book, it all about glorifying God and realizing that He want s us to live a happy stress-free life.  But we must be content.  It is only then, can He shine through us and multiply His Kingdom.  Just this week, I was invited to go shopping with a friend and realized that she was so miserable because she was focusing on the rainy weather, the $500 suit she yearned for, and the mortgage payment.  I handed her my book from my \\"mission\\" box in the back of my car.  She called me tonight and said that Mr. Lucado \\"rocks!\\"  She sounded much happier!

My sister gave it to me because it has a theme, much like my life- \\"the good guy sometimes wins.\\"  When she told me that it was like my experiences, I had to read it.  After publishing a book, I was really wondering if I had the zest to read someone else's book, as sleep deprivation was still kicking in.  Well, little sleep I got as I curled up under my skylight with, \\"R is for Ricohet\\" and a hot cup of black tea.  Like in \\"Q is for Quarry\\", we are at the desk of Kilsey Millhone- the beautiful, brainy detective who always finds herself \\"into hot cases.\\"  Nord Lafferty needs her help and he needs it fast.  His daughter is fixing to be paroled from  prison.  He needs her to babysit his daughter.  This seems like \\"free\\" money that she can't pass up.  However, she soon realizes that she gets more than she bargained for when she finds his daughter is rebellious; ends up in the park with the man that sent her to prison, and wants no babysitter.  Trying to book Alan Beckwith only adds to the drama.  For, in order to get Reba to talk, many could fall.  Although it is a dangerous and risky task, Millhone takes it all on.  As usual, she rocks will doing it!	2004-10-22

Yet, we have another exceptional book from Jamie Lee!  She has such compassion for her craft of writing books for kids.  I just bought several copies for family, as I cannot have children.  But I do remember the problems with waiting in line, pushing, and the first day of school for my foster children.  It can be a fearful transition for a child.  Buying this book which explains everything decreases that fear. In nursing school, we are taught about the importance of teaching plans.  What about the kids?  They need it too!What I learned in nursing school and foster parent training about development and the many obstacles that tag along with it, is  explained on a child's level in this book; therefore, I highly recommend it!

It takes alot of energy and inspiration to not \\"throw the towel in.\\"  I know because My dad is in a wheelchair after a sudden stroke.  Mr. Reeve's determination has served a s a role model for my dad.  There is alot of things that he will never do, as he discusses in the book and many interviews: however, it is the attitude that it wouldn't stop him from dreaming and going for his goals that made him succeed with zest. A remarkable man that has not only changed his life with his books, spinal cord research sponsership, and leadership, but also our own.	2004-10-22

I totally support this book because of its theme of the horrible treatment of Jews during the 40s(Holocaust survivors could tell you vividly!) that could have happened here.  Think about it- FDR is defeated and now every Jewish household is in constant fear.  I actually did a book report in high school on the Holocaust.  It was then that I realized - Yes, it could happen here.  The people in the Netherlands who were eating tulips as a luxury item probally never thought it could happen there until Hitler spread his reign out further.

Anyway, I thought I was in history class again at moments like the social differences and political influences.

For I realized that, even in my prior Amish and Mennonite religions, I tried really hard to get a guy's attention. When the fact was that he wasn't attracted.  I have seen many an Amish girl never get married(I talk about this in \\"Leaving Lancaster County\\") because \\"Mr. Right\\" never asked her.

Although the book didn't go into detail in some aspects of Mr. James' life, it did shine a light to let us see what type of person the famous author was and how he used his personality to write such hit books.  The fact that he takes his friends for granted, at times, until they are no longer there, made me feel a little on the edge.  But his incorporating some of their characteristics into his books made me  appreciate such a man.  I had read Mr. James' and Mr. Moore's, \\"The Portrait Of A Lady\\", last year and feel it, along with his own life, will always be sought-after material.

I find this especially true in  the part about the Mennonite friends; conflict of interest; and shunning of family members. For  all of these things were so real in Lancaster when I was living there.  It brought me back in time, as I turned every page!
