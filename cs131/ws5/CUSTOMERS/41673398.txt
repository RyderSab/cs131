Unfortunetly, most of it did, however I did kept reading. <br /> <br />I liked the idea and most of the story, and I think it was a good \\"1st try\\", but it is a bit flawed, and I thought the ending (the last 60 pages or so) was a total disaster. <br /> <br />I didn't like the way the author kept pointing out the obvious, all throughout the book. I also didn't enjoy the way he recounted the past of many characters (At times it made me feel it was just to fill pages), and I saw no need for a love story. I will not comment on his facts, because this is a work of fiction, and it shows. <br /> <br />Still, I believe this is an enjoyable book, and would recommend it, as long as you remember... this is FICTION  <br /> <br />	2005-07-29

There is one beautiful picture for every day of the year.... thats a lot of doggie pictures!!... and each day also comes with a quote, fun fact or something else about dogs!....You could spend hours looking at the pictures and reading the small bits of information!<br />The size is just perfect to put either on your desk, or your bedside table, and the plastic container/display  is very sturdy and a bit hard to knock over (according to my dog)<br />The only reason why I didnt give it a 5 star rating was because it doesnt feature a lot of breeds. It seems to focus on: Basset and Blood Hounds, Bull Dogs, Daschunds, Weimareners, Bull Terriers and Retrievers.  I would have loved to see more terrier breeds featured... at least one schnauzer and maybe some  rare breeds.  Also.. it doesnt provide captions for the pictures, so if you dont know what breed it is... you wont be able to find out!<br />All in all, lovely pictures, beautiful dogs, pretty cool calendar for 2004!<br />Im happy!	2004-01-09

It has lots of space for writing stuff in, including   notes sections and a special dates to remember page for every divider.<br />The only thing I dont like was that apart from the front and back covers  Doggie pictures, it only has SIX more dog pictures inside which also work as two month dividers. The breeds featured are:  Golden Retriever puppy, West Highland White Terrier, German Sheperd puppy, Beagle, Wire Hair Daschund and finally 2 Jack Russell Terrier puppies.<br />It is very handy and it covers my needs, but if you are looking for pictures... this one isnt for you!!	2004-01-09

I honestly thought this book was brilliant.... <br />Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.  It is written with an incredible British humour (Bridget Jones type... but  funnier), plus it is filled with very realistic situations, and real life places making it easier to picture.<br />The book is about the very complicated life of a superficial Becky Bloomwood, who lives to shop and shops to live... <BR>What I loved about her was that she could be anyone... of course... she goes a bit too far.. but I am sure most of us have used our credit cards when we shouldn't have, or  bought things we didnt actually need but convinced ourselves we couldn't keep breathing is we didn't have them, and afterwards couldn't figure out how to pay for them, and so on...<br />The book is also filled  with very specific details (which proves the author did some research concerning shops and prices) and is, in my opinion a wonderful insight into Becky's  mind, especially when trying to justify her shopping habits.... simply fabulous!!  <BR> <BR>It kept me laughing from cover to cover... and thats a bit hard to achieve.<br />READ IT!

Its Cinderella, so I knew what I was reading from the beginning, no big surprises there.  I also liked the perspective from which the book was written, and I especially enjoyed the description of different places, people and costumes.<BR>It is by all accounts a very well written book, easy to read and to follow, with tri-dimensional characters, although they tend to be stereotypes, and an exceptional twist in the end.<br />I think the problem for me was that I read Wicked first, and that book is a work of art.  So, when reading this one, to me it was just.. a novel.<br />It is a fun book, and a very good adaptation on a very well known story, however, no &quot;food for thought&quot; because it is not as profound as Wicked	2003-12-04

I cant say I loved this book, but I cant say I didnt like it either.<br />Some parts were amazing, very funny, well written and with many divine secrets and rituals... having said that, I would have left the book at that, because I didnt really like the main character. Her &quot;horror stories&quot; really took out most of the fun of the rest of the book. She is a very complicated person, who had a rough life, but who made very strange decisions that deeply wounded the people around her.<br />The 4 friends are truly amazing... I really wish we could all have received that kind of support when we have needed it, but I dont think they could exist in real life.<br />In the end, I have mixed feelings about the book, if I could... I would have read only the funny parts, and skipped the rest.	2003-12-04

It is a little different from what I normally read, but I am so glad that it finally found its way to the top of the &quot;waiting pile&quot;.<br />The book is a collection of short stories. Stories full of drama and tragedy, stories of exiles and fugitives, stories of hunger and misery, stories of foreigners and strangers. Yet, it is also the life story of two women, and of their two mysterious companions... Lola and Petroushka, and once you begin reading, you will find it hard to stop.<br />So, give it a chance, I assure you that you will find yourself wrapped around the surreal but highly believable world of Elena Garro.	2002-07-19

I feel a bit guilty about not putting 5 stars as everyone else, but I guess I just need to let others like me know what to expect when they read this book.<br />The main reason why I bought it was  because everyone put 5 stars on it, and I do have to admit I liked it. It is filled will lessons of life, some of which are very funny, others are a bit sad, but in the end the messages are encouraging and motivating.<br />Now, the reason for the 4 star rating is that I found some of the stories a bit unbelievable, and although I love happy endings, there were way too many here. Also, I found the writing style hard to understand sometimes, since it uses a lot of &quot;argot&quot;, which made it difficult to focus and keep the stories flowing.<br />Having said that, I do have to point out that  this is definetly a Happy Book, full of funny characters, nice stories and  lots of love ... it will put a smile on your face and fill your heart with joy.	2002-06-27

However, it is not the events that make the book, but the reactions and thoughts the different characters have.<br />The main character, Mersault is simply intriguing... you learn about his life, his thoughts, his feelings... and yet, you know nothing at all... in my opinion, he is one of those characters that grows on you and in some instances you can even feel  identified with him, but in the end he is a Stranger whom you dont understand. <br />The plot itself is not very interesting, and it is a bit depressing, starting with a funeral and then moving on to a murder and finally a trail and  life in jail... still  it keeps you reading... I know,  it is hard to explain, and I guess that is exactly what has made this book a classic, it is impossible to categorize, analyze or even try to make sense of it.... but it is also impossible to put it down.	2002-06-27

It seemed to me way too unrealistic... especially the way a mother would write to her child. It sounded just too objective and straight forward and so unpersonal, it simply didn't feel real.<br />Also, the characters are, in my opinion, like cookie cut characters... flawless, beautiful, nice, good... too perfect....<br />Still, I gave the book 3 stars because it does have some good advice, like the 5 balls of life theory, and it is a fast read with a nice, although 100% expected fairytale ending.	2002-06-18

I do however like and enjoy his books, and I simply can't consider this one as &quot;his&quot;.<BR>Having said that, let me go into what I think of The Family. <br />To me this book was a light and easy read. Probably a little bit too light, with not as much information or detail as I would have liked, but still the history of this family makes for a good story. <BR>The characters are not very well defined, but I guess this is due in part to the fact that two different authors wrote the book, and also to history itself, because it is much harder to know the thoughts and feelings of real people than it is to know those of whom you have created. <br />About the book in general, I loved reading about the Renaissance, especially in  Italy, and I liked the fact that famous figures were included such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Maquiavelo.<BR>I also enjoyed reading about the Church, about the feud for land, power and religion. I did however found the book a bit lacking, and not providing enough information to make things clear enough.<br />Now, about Mr. Rodrigo Borgia, even if you know the type of sins that have been committed in the name of God, this book will shock you. I couldn't believe the extremes that one person could go to, and as I kept reading I just read about more and more shocking episodes.... and about the sacrifies everyone had to make for... The Family...<br />All in all, an entertaining read, as long as you keep in mind that Mario Puzo wasn't there to see it come to life.  Still, BRAVO to Carol Gino for making this last dream come true....	2002-05-20

Also, I thought some of the books passages were very realistic, such as his encounter with President Lincoln.<br />Finally, this is a book about family, about different points of view, about tragedy, but most of all, about an event that changed this country forever.	2002-05-14

I will never regret reading it!<br />Simply put, I loved this book!!! It had a very well developed and believable plot, it had enough malice to make me mad, romance to make me happy and funny episodes to make me smile.<br />This book just lays down a road into an unknown and secret world, and lets you walk it yourself, experiencing everything, from the sweetest smells to the most horrible sights.<br />I was very pleasantly surprised by what I read and I found the book constantly pulling me in, letting me experience Japan, Gion, and being a Geisha....<br />All in all, a very entertaining and satisfying read, five solid stars.	2002-05-03

It just seemed like an excellent idea to be able to experience an author in this extraordinary way, communicating with his number one fans: kids.<br />Sadly, when I read it, I didn't like it that much. First of all, it was a very short read. I finished  reading it in one afternoon. Secondly, I found the book to be lacking information, because letters are presented here and there, but most of the time we don't get to read a \\"two-way\\" conversation, so it is hard to follow. Also, I expected to read letters to and from many children, and was a bit disappointed when I realised only a few children's letters were featured.<br />Still, I love C.S.

The characters are not totally believable, but you can still picture them quite well.  <br />As for Bridget.... I just kept wondering WHAT NOW?... there's a limit to how many stupid things a person can do... sometimes she made me laugh and I identified with her, but others I just felt pity.... <br />I put three stars because I admit I liked the film better, and it made me laugh a lot more than the book.	2002-04-23

It also lets  you see humanity at its best and worst, and decide what truly is or becomes evil.<br />I honestly found myself not only liking, but admiring Elphaba, and wondering what could have happened had things been different.<br />I have to admit I was slightly dissapointed with the ending, because it left so many questions unanswered ... what happened next? What happened in Munchkinland? What happened to the Animals? to Nor? to Nanny?, and... to the Wizard?<br />Finally, I really liked the fact that although we know what happens to Elphaba before we start reading, the storyline is brilliant and keeps you hooked page after page, always wishing something will change the course of events.	2002-04-23

I also enyojed  the description of what life is like in a very small and tight community, where everyone knows everything or mostly everything about everyone else. I live in a very large city, so it was a nice change.<br />I think the problem for me started when the book, which seemed like a very realistic and believable story at first, turned into a complete fairytale with Prince Charming and Fairy God Mother included... Its not that I don't like fairytales, I just wasn't expecting this book to turn into one.<BR>Also, I found the characters to be extremelly stereotyped, although most of them were nice.<br />Still, I loved the fact that in the end the  book is a happy, lift your spirits book, and it is definetly an easy read.	2002-04-23

It could have been a very sad book, but surprisingly it isn't. It is however a book about family, happiness, LOVE, Childhood memories, dreams, wishes and wonders, and especially about Mum.<br />One of the things I liked  most about the book was that it really felt as if an eight year old was telling the story, and, for a few moments I was allowed to go inside her mind and her heart. Through her account of what was  probably the worst day of her young life she makes you laugh, cry, sing, dance and above all... REMEMBER.... you go back to being a child, when everything was simple, when anything made you laugh, and where just hugging your mother made everything alright.	2002-03-13

She's not your picture perfect mother... but then again, no one is... still...the author makes you feel what she's feeling, even if you don't understand her... and her family.<br />The reason why I put 4 stars was that I felt the book was a bit incomplete, because we never find out so many things that in my opinion should have been explained... also... in the end, we really don't know what happened to the family, and after NINE years of KNOWING every single detail, it was a bit hard to let them go. <br />Over all, a good, entertaining, but extremelly frightening book. However, I would love to ask the author a few questions that remained unsolved...	2002-03-08

I loved them. They were simple, had very nice endings, the characters were not only children my age, but in most books girls, and, above all, they made me feel both happy and safe.<br />Now, many years later, I ordered this edition, which has beautiful colour pictures, and contains the seven books (in a different order) and decided to read them again. This time around I think I grasped  how DEEP the meaning of  these books really is, and understood why they make me feel so good!... Reading them again was like eating my favourite ice cream flavour...<br />These are books for any age, beautifully written, with extraordinary characters, interesting sotries, and with a fantasy world that comes to life immediatly in your mind, and specially in your heart.	2002-03-05

I didn't love it, but I'm glad I read it.<br />Parts of it were very good, such as the description of what life was like in the 17th century, how things were done, how life was seen through a painter's eyes, how families lived, etc...<br />Others were dull and tedious to read, but I won't go into that.<br />The main character, Griet, is a 16 year old girl, who is &quot;forced&quot; to work as a maid for Vermeer, a very famous painter. She is very bright, and she has the ability to know exactly what everyone thinks about her, feel when someone is behind her and  when she is being looked at, know exactly what people want from her, and even make changes that make paintings perfect, which makes her very unbelievable, but, apart from that, she is likable and you do find yourself in her shoes from time to time.<br />The storyline is simple, not very elaborate, and the characters are either pure white or  midnight black. <br />The story is definetly fiction, yes, it is based on a true painting, and on the life of the artist who painted it, but so little is known about the painter's life that Chevalier really let her imagination flow when it came to the feelings and attitudes of all the characters.<br />Finally, if you really want to read this, you will enjoy it, if you don't have very high expectations, and it is a simple easy read for a relaxed afternoon with a nice cup of coffee!	2001-12-17

It is confusing, the characters are very shallow and unbelievable, and the stories seem to have no beginning and no end... which is sometimes good, but it doesn't work in this case.<br />I also have to say that Fuentes still writes beautifully, he is a virtous writer and his choice of words is exceptional, but all in all, I wouldn't reccommend this book unless you are a true fan; but if you are just getting to know him, please read Aura,  magical realism  at its best!(...)	2001-12-17

I have to say the story is good, and if developed properly it would have been a fantastic read, but, it is not very well developed, it is very slow at some points, too fast at others, and  it sort of  felt like homework.<br />The book is divided into three parts. The 1st part is basically about childhood and teenage memories of the daughter. You end up thinking the mother is totally mad and belongs in a nut house!<br />The second part (the best by far) is the life of the mother in China at the turn of the century. This part was nice because it gives the reader a pretty good idea of what life was like, the traditions, the beliefs, the hidden emotions and the fears of normal people; but it tells a very sad story.<br />Finally the third part is again, the daughter, who, after reading about her mother's life finds out she really loves her, and forgives her, and well... a fairytale ending.<br />In my opinion the book was very descriptive in the first two parts and then it went into a very quick and short, extremelly nice and unbelievable ending.<br />The life of Ruth, the daugther, seems very hollow and unimportant after reading the mother's, and the characters are very black and white, not very realistic.<br />If you really want to read it, I would recommend burrowing it from someone, or reading it at the library.	2001-12-03

Honestly, after finishing Lord of the Rings, I can't help but feel sad because it's over!!!<br /><br />This story is incredible, the characters are profound, and very real, the Middle Earth comes to life in such a way that it becomes impossible to think that it doesn't exist, and there are so many different tales left untold that would be worth telling.<br />There really isn't enough I can say about this books, and especially about the Return of the King. We find each character following his own destiny, and facing his deepest fears, we see inner struggle, a huge war where each piece is as important as the rest and where they all move wisely and bravely into what awaits them, we discover courage in whom we least expect, and above all we find ourselves celebrating with them  victory and love.

These decisions that they make, take each character on its own path and the events that take place in this book really help in developing the complete tale.<br />The whole story really takes shape in it. Loads of things start happening, and many different characters take center stage. There is a lot more action, and the plot takes a few unexpected twists.<br />Unlike the first part (The Fellowship of the Ring), this second book actually does have a season finale ending! so make sure you have the Return of the King (3rd part) close by, because you will want to start reading it straight away!	2001-11-07

I also liked and appreciated the fact that he did a lot of scientific, social and historical  research for this book, which really comes through when you are reading.<br />Still, this isn't an easy book, because it covers many different stories, sad ones, and goes back and forth in time, but, if you let yourself go, and just give the book and the author a chance to take you into this marvelous trip throughout Sri Lanka, and the lives of its very shaken and frightened people, I am sure you will enjoy it.	2001-10-15

It is extremelly well written, simple yet very profound and manages to take you through a very sad and painful road we will all eventually go through, in a very loving way, the loss of a loved one. <br />It sometimes made me laugh, most of the time I had to remove tears from my face to keep on reading, but I am very thankful to Isabel Allende for  sharing with  me the most difficult time of her life, her story, and her suffering. I had never felt so identified with an author, and never had a book given me the chance to enter the author's mind, heart and soul. <br />What is trully remarkable about this book is that it wasn't inteded for us to read, it was only meant for Paula, so she wouldn't feel lost when she woke up, and yet you can immediatly identify with what goes on, and sense the everlasting, unmeasurable love of Isabel for her daughter.<br />It covers many subjects... history, family, war, illness, success, failures, but most of all, this is a book that celebrates life and LOVE.	2001-10-15

I loved it because it is a very different love story, a story of a love that could never take place, and still, it did... The story line is simple, well developed, enigmatic and very different, in one word... BRILLIANT<br />This is a fantastic book, with magical but very realistic characters, sometimes loving, other times very cruel, and at all times very human.<br />It tells the story of Sierva Maria, poor little rich girl... she never felt the love of her parents, was raised by her African servants, got bitten by a dog with rabies, and was believed to be possesed by demons.<br />I must warn you, this is not your happily ever after story, but it is definetly well worth your time. It is exquisite!	2001-10-15

This book grabbed my attention the minute I read the title...&quot;Drowning Ruth&quot;...no...that looks like a sad and morbid story...ok, pick it up, what does it say on the back cover? <br />&quot;A gripping psycholigical thriller... In the winter of 1919, a young mother named Mathilda Neumann drowns beneath the ice of a rural Winsconsin lake. The shock of her death dramatically changes the lives of her daughter, troubled sister, and husband...&quot;<BR>-Francine Prose,  Us Weekly<br />Even after reading that, I still didn't like the title, yet...the red letters on the cover kept calling my name, so after almost an hour I bought it!... I'm so happy I did!!... It was no mistake!!! This is an excellent book, and took me only three days to read. I could barely put it down, and it is the type of book that stays in your mind all through the day, even while you are doing other things.<br />It is honestly hard to believe that this is the first book of Christina Schwarz, because she is amazing!... She manages beautifally to develop the story from very different points of view, bringing the characters to life, and to go back and forth in history without causing confussion, and if you add to that the incredibly well developed characters and a simply but magnificent story line.... you can only take your hat off and applaud!!.... I loved it so much I'm buying more copies to give away... I really want her to write many more books!<br />Ok... enough about what I thought... let's talk about the story. It starts in 1919, told by Amanda, or Aunt Mandy as Ruth would call her, on the night when Mathilda, Ruth's mother and Amanda's sister dies. Aunt Mandy has no choice but to take care of Ruth, and raise her, until Ruth is old enough to start asking, remembering and finding out the secrets that surround her mother's death, and Aunt Mandy's obession with her.<br />Ok... I won't tell you more, just that I highly recommend it.	2001-10-10

It is a great story about life, death, family, friends, war, and everything else you can think of. <br />Isabel Allende manages beautifly to mingle fiction with reality, and tells the story of a family, and especially the relationship between a girl, who is telling the story, her mother and her grandmother. They are not the only characters in the book, and, as in real life, the story is filled with many different people that come through the door of anyones life, some stay for just a few seconds, some become best friends, some even enemies. But, even with so many different characters, they are very complex, yet very simple and real, which makes you laugh and cry along with them all through the book.<br />I loved this book in part because it is an excellent story, but also because it gave me an insight of what was happening in Chile during the 20th century, and how the people that lived through it were able to make it, and also because it showed me that the people we love are never gone from our lives, even if their physical selves are no longer with us.	2001-10-05

It is a name that says POWER, LOVE, INTRIGUE, MYSTERY, ESCAPE, TRAGEDY.... but it is also a name that for Nicholas, Alexandra, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and Alexei meant FAMILY, and as a family they stuck together, through illness, war, infamy, and even death.<br />This book tells an incredible love story, that could beat any novel out there, and proves that life is always more mysterious, magical but also more cruel than fiction. It portrays the Romanovs as a family, and gives you an insight on their lives, their thoughts, their letters, their friends and their sufferings. It also lets you take a peek at Tsarist Russia, its power, its magic, its fancies, its relations with other empires,  and many other things.<br />Robert Massie is an expert on this subject, and you can see that a lot of research went into creating this book.<br />I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because it is a bit outdated when it comes to the finding and retreaval of the bodies, but this is covered in a latter book by the same author.<br />Highly recommended, especially is you like history.	2001-10-01
