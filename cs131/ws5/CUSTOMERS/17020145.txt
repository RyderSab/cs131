I especially loved the pages devoted to his time on the spaghetti western The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. I have watched Mr. Wallach's films for years and never realized he was a method actor. But a good, sensible one. Marlon Brando, Mr. Wallach relates, was crazy with the method and treated Eli with strange verbal and physical cruelty on stage due to it. That was Brando for you, Eli. Just one tiny point. Charlton Heston, by Mr. Wallach, is said to be 6 feet tall. I think Chucky's closer to 6'3 or 6\\"4.	2005-04-24

The former Iraqi leader got a million Iraqis and Iranians killed in the war between the two nations from 1980 to 1988, Saddam killed thousands of ethnic Kurds in Iraq and robbed those Kurds he didn't kill of almost any rights, caused 25% of Iraqi kids to starve (a Unicef report made in 2002 showed this), took over the nation Kuwait to pay off war debts, afer being expelled from there in the deadly Desert Storm he tried to take over again in 94, etc. What did the guy have to do before we decided he had to be taken out of power---destroy half of Japan?  Tragert you should know better than almost anyone else that Saddam was worse for his own Iraqi than the coalition has ever been.	2005-04-15

Feldman, just how would we have done that? Saddam was very determined to keep his postion in Iraq as leader. He even provenly employed doubles of himself to thwart any attempted assassination overthrow of him by plotters. Also, Saddam killed over a million of his own Iraqis amd terrorized close to all of them while he was in power. Strong state you claim he had, huh? Sure! Terrorizing, national dictators often do manage to have strong states under their sway. Also, he sent SCUD missiles at Israel. Feldman, aren't you Jewish? He was bad for your Jewish cousins, if you are. Think about that for a while. Lastly, the USA has 350 million people. Iraq had around 23 million. We have a right to put ourselves before them in importance due to our much greater numbers.	2005-03-14

The Jew today is usually shown to be one by the fact that they have far more semitic dna than the non-Jewish folks they live among (for example, Russian Jews compared to Russian Orthodox Christians). Rigg slightly obscures this fact early in the book when he talks of Jews having no DNA unique to them. Being descended of Jewish tribes who fled Israel in disapora times is the only way all the Russian Jews today could have so much semitic blood.	2005-03-06

He does repeat himself a lot. The part that bothered me most, though, was his overly critical analysis of the '98 Godzilla film by Tri-Star. Look the new film did have good effects and I didn't think they killed Godzilla as easily in New York (again in the film) as this author claims. And what was wrong with making Godzilla pregnant in the film? That was to imply the menace of the creature could ontinually be reeborn even if they destroyed the creature. Another thing. The author somewhat sympathises too much with Japan for being nuked in 1945. Look fella! Invasion of Manchuria by Japan 1931. Rape of Nanking by Japan in 1937.Pearl Harbor bombed by Japan 1941. Hong Kong invaded by Japan 1940's.And more big aggresive acts by Japan. The Japanese were not such victims in Hiroshima as they and you claim.	2005-02-27

The author of the preface deems that Jesus, Mary, and Joseph must have all been black skinned to go into Egypt and hide there. The faulty thinking is that all Egyptian people were darkskinned and thus black. Far from all egyptians were actually blackskinned. There were white Greeks living and (until around 31 BC) running Egypt, remember Cleopatra. White Italians running and rsesiding Egypt as it was now a Roman province and so on.

BG admits to having one night stands! He's also too frank in his discussing his sexual habits while a married man.

This was a belief that the Lost 10 Tribes of Israel made their way to the British isles and settled there. This theory was suppported by the fact that the English actually did resemble Jewish people (Lyndon Johnson and Golda Meir). We now now through DNA studies that the theory is false. The English only look like Jews because 10,000 years ago a bunch of neolithic syrian farmers came and settled in Europe, especially Britain. The author, when writing this book and section about the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, doesn't mention how someday the descendents of Britain would be mistaken for Jews.	2004-12-13

The author really thinks he is going to be more impressive by quoting some actual scientific facts (like the number of genes we have as opposed to the number a fly has). He also picks on Darwin's theories and talks as if late 20thcentury conventional scientists completely turned against Darwin's theories. Realize this people. Darwin died over 120 yearsa ago. Of course some of the stuff he said about evolution wasn't going to be true. But a hell of a lot of it was. Many conventional scientists now realize Darwin was certainly partially right and furthermore disbelieving a couple of Darewin's many evolutionary theories doesn't mean a scientist is against evolution in general.	2004-11-22

That Al Pacino was too busy doing The Godfather to appear in it. Huh? Pacino played Michael Corleone in 1974's The Godfather Part 2 and didn't play him again until 1990's The Godfather Part 3. How was Pacino too busy with The Godfather to play in HG in the late 70's early 80's? Also, the movie claims  Robert DeNiro was too busy to appear in what became the Kris Kristofferson role in HG. Ok but he book claims getting KK for this role was the thing that hurt HG the most. This is mostly wrong as an analysis. DeNiro isn't much suited for westerns. Kristofferson with his countryboy way was better suited for it. Also, the problem with HG was the badly photographed and terribly edited sequeances and terribly written screenplay by (also) director Michael Cimino, having DeNiro in the lead would not have helped one bit in fact it would have just hurt the film more.	2004-11-22

My ninth grade english teacher told us that maybe Finny never existed and that he was probably just a part of Gene. I saw in the section when they describe \\"A. Hopkins Parker\\" that no proof of Finny's remarkable athletic accomplishment gets listed on the plaque (as only Gene witnesses it) and that if Finny's name had gone up on the plaque (replacing A. Hopkins) it would have proved Finny had actually really existed.
