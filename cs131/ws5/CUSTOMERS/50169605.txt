I thought it was unique and enjoyed a lot of it, but I was ready for the story to be over long before the end.  For me it became a shallow observation spanning 8 years of the lives of Susie's family and friends from her view point in heaven.   <br /> <br />I thought there were a couple of opportunities that were missed, action and philosophical depth.  I don't require action in a story.  Some good old fashion haunting may have helped or may have hurt the story, but Susie's unexplained and uncontrolled appearances didn't do anything for it.  And for depth, I don't expect a treatise on death a la Peirs Anthony's `On a Pale Horse' but some philosophical exploration would have been nice.   <br /> <br />There are some great books that are simple observations of average individuals, `Plainsong' by Kent Haruf, `I Know This Much is True' by Wally Lamb, `The Heart is a Lonely Hunter' by Carson McCullers.  If the intent of this book was to take a poetic journey through the lives of the Salmon family, then the writing just didn't compel me in that direction.  `The Lovely Bones' had potential but, for me, it missed the bull's eye if there was even a target.	2005-09-13

She adds a few plot devices that lack inspiration and toys with them long enough to fill the book... take Bender in already.  The lost handcuffs got tired.  The Rabbit.  And I'm glad Albert Kloughn's, Joe Pesci character got distracted from bounty hunting midway through the book.  Lula's character is good, but there only needs to be one.   <br /> <br />I'm ready for Stephanie Plum to get some skills.  I want Stephanie to get the upper hand on Abruzzi and to be a part of bringing him down.  I like that when she gets scared she walks right up to her fear and tells him to back off, but why not put some bullets in the gun and keep it handy instead of half loaded at the bottom of an overstuffed handbag.  This ending was a disappointment. <br /> <br />This series is fun enough to continue following, but I'm glad to be almost caught up so I can cut down to one book a year.  Maybe that will help keep it fun.  2.5 stars	2004-09-21

Half way through the book, I wasn't wowed. Then while I was telling somebody else about it, it dawned on me how deep the characters and the story had grown.  It's a coming of age story for a whole town and one young girl.  Every character is so natural through the story that a rich diversity of music, politics, philosophy, and religion is subtly and radically revealed.   <br /> <br />Mick Kelly's experiences at her \\"prom\\" and the swimming hole, her relationships with her siblings, and obsession with music provide a parallel for the life of each other person.   A deaf-mute as a focus to share a secret with each character was inspired.  We're all individuals in the same boat.  The abrupt last sentence of Part 2 is brilliant.   <br /> <br />It's a simple story to enjoy with plenty to discover and digest throughout.	2004-08-10

With terrible outcomes expected and certain individuals suspected, I was constantly worried about these characters.  Sapo is a scary guy, but absolutely hilarious.  Neno was obviously a lot of fun for Quinonez to write and was a blast to read.  I'm not going to give anything about my opinion of the story and the finale, because I'm afraid it would give too much away.  Excellent debut!! <br /> <br />One problem with audio books is that I wonder if I would have gotten as much out of the story without the superb narration of Robert Ramirez.  He is fantastic.  He brings the characters to life and really makes you feel them.  I'll be looking for every other book he has narrated.  Great Job!!	2004-07-28

I didn't really enjoy reading 'Almost'.  It was kind of a tedious, repetitious ramble.  All of the characters felt thinly developed which made them appear really unstable and shallow.  I'm sure unstable was what the author was after, but shallow made them hard to connect with or care about. Then there was this strong `happy ending' closing paragraph that brought all of the rambling events into a very tight wrap and I was able to step back and enjoy.  Interesting.	2004-03-01

When the character's adrenaline rises, the reader's does too.  The scene of newspaper staff trying to reach deadlines at the offices of the Chronicle was nearly as intense as rush hour in the TRACON.  Great fun.  The quality of these scenes made me feel like the author had a strong grasp on the subject matter and I loved it.  Senator Master's ego and political gaming was also very well done and it brought about a very satisfying conclusion.<br />I would have enjoyed this book more if the extortion section would have been left out.  It was too unbelievable that this character could have stolen items from a crash scene to begin with, but it was totally unnecessary and really a distraction from an otherwise perfectly exciting story.  Overall a great book!	2004-02-25

The concept of this story felt contrived and the rest of the book was trying to convince me that it wasn't. You could almost hear the author asking the 'What ifs' that gave him something to write about. &quot;What if a former secret serviceman?&quot;, &quot;What if the former secret serviceman wanted revenge against the President?&quot;, &quot;Let's see, Ok, what if that former secret serviceman's son was...?&quot; That's it. Write it down.       And it isn't a terrible story. It was fleshed out pretty well, but never enough meat to become fully convincing. I couldn't pinpoint what 'The Fourth Perimeter' lacked until I started reading, Paul McElroy's 'TRACON', which had everything this book was missing, the intimate details about the subject that allows a reader to truly experience the events of the story. Maybe if we could have had more inner workings of the secret service and a better portrayal of Kurt Ford's business operations as he divested himself of his security software company, I would have cared more. As it was, the focus is on Kurt Ford's barely contained lunacy while the author tries to hold our interest with justifications for Ford's actions. It didn't work for me.    Made me wonder if I could write a better story. Heads 2 stars, tails 3 stars. tails	2004-02-25

I liked having the threat of Soneji in Jack and Jill, but as a main character, he becomes a tedious, repetitious attempt for Alex Cross to create a psychological profile.  It is plain annoying. Then Mr. Smith felt like a scrap of writing that Patterson had lying around that he wanted to use somewhere.  The second, first person narrator through the mid section of the book was an obvious and unsatisfying attempt to attach it.  Bad!<br />What's good?  I love the primary characters.  Alex, Nana, Jannie, Damon, Christine Johnson are excellent.  The relationships are outstanding.  John Sampson is also a very cool character and was severely underused in this story.  Tom Pierce got too much focus and Sampson was forgotten.  James Patterson falls way short in this one.	2004-02-17

Spenser is a great human character, with nicely developed strengths and weaknesses, and a beautiful ability to downplay both in every conversation.  He gets the job done no matter which obstacles his client throws in the way and finds something good in each person no matter how unpleasant they are.  I like this guy.	2003-12-03

I didn't find very much humor in this book which was fine because I really enjoyed the characters, felt like they were given much more depth than the characters in the Stephanie Plum novels, and actually missed them when I was finished with the book.  I don't really read romances, because I get so tired of innocent conversations between the characters resulting in internal suspicion, doubt, and questions, but if the book would have stuck with romance I probably would have gone with a 7/10 rating.  <br />Maybe if the bad guy would have been developed better he would have worked.  He was just too inconsistent.  There was new material and new characters added to the original 1980's version of this book?  I never read the original, but I believe I know what character and scene was added and unfortunately it didn't get worked into the story well and didn't belong.  However, Janet Evanovich remains a gifted writer.  4/10	2003-12-01

The first 40 pages read so true that I off and bought myself the next five books in the series knowing I would not be disappointed.  On his web site, Robert Crais mentions that he started writing novels because there are just some things that can't be done on TV.  Very true.  This quality of writing would not be evident on the screen.  The written characters, scenery and situations are superb.  <br />Complaints?  Very minor.  A couple extraneous wise cracks and a small weakness in plot in that the bad guys had no reason to pick the battle they chose.  The weaknesses are easily overlooked because each paragraph is so visually and believably written.   <br />After reading other reviews, it sounds like even my minor complaints won't be present in future Cole novels.  Excellent!  Crais is definitely capable.	2003-04-24

Tolkien but ambitious enough to continually remind me of their work.<br />I really liked the set up of the story over the first half of the book.  A reader can experience a very foreign place and time that feels increasingly familiar as each event creates more insight into prehistoric landscape, society, species, races, thought, religion and language.  The description of the mental, physical, spiritual consistency of the Clan race and the Others was fascinating and believable.  The use of a five year old girl trying to fit in and bridge the gap between her younger forward thinking race and the more ancient memory ridden Clan of the Cave Bear was a perfect way to show differences and similarities.  <br />Through the second half of the book, it settles into a good story but doesn't reveal as much of Auel's amazing depiction of the prehistoric world that I found so captivating in the beginning.  The characters started to remind me of people today with the same free thinking, tradition bound differences and similarities that we enjoy and struggle with.   <br />I really enjoyed the end of the book and found myself out the next day purchasing the next in the series.	2003-04-04

Every paragraph is flawless and creative.  Like the ultra smooth transition from revulsion at the scene of a murder to Joe Morelli's perceived snub that resulted in Stephanie Plum's contemplation of adding red highlights to her hair.  New chapter. Immediately Stephanie is slapping down her last $60 to alter her hair.  <br />Janet Evanovich is a craftswoman.  Once again we have an author that can anticipate the thoughts of the reader and write every scene and transition for maximum surprise and amusement.  And it is done so simply it is possible that a reader may not recognize that it is all intentional.  Strong writing plain and simple.	2003-03-25

Stuart Woods' writing strolls along effortlessly yet has more twists and turns than about any author I've read.  The very effective element of surprise in `New York Dead' stands this one up beside a Robert Ludlum novel.  The surprises were truly unexpected and kept me completely disoriented.  <br />Stuart Wood's characters are also very well done.  Stone Barrington's exclusion for being `white bread', as well as his financial difficulties and bout of unemployment was interesting, realistic and refreshing.  Dino Bachetti and the self preservation of the precinct created an extremely appealing obscurity around the case.  Even Cary Hilliard's duality worked for me which was surprising in itself.  <br />Too many characters became somehow connected kind of making Manhattan feel like it was inhabited by about two dozen people, but I was able to overlook most of that.  I do wish Scoop Berman's role had been a completely anonymous character or left out completely.  He was one too many and kind of an eye roller. <br />In my opinion, Stuart Wood's smooth delivery puts him next in line to John Sandford.  This could be the author I've been looking for!	2003-01-28

Plum walks right up to every situation with fierce determination that nobody takes seriously but everybody admires.  She's dogged in her pursuits and hounded by the pursued (and one cop).  Then Janet Evanovich drops these hilarious one line surprises out of nowhere that have you busting up for weeks afterward.  `Next time I find ...

I actually liked the villians, but was very happy to see them go.  And Lehane uses some thought provoking social commentary to create some depth for his leads.  Nice.<br />I like what Dennis Lehane is trying to do with his character's personal lives and professional flaws to make the story realistic and believable.  It works pretty well, but I often had to forcefully put myself in Patrick Kensie's shoes to understand a situation or give reason for an error in judgment.  The conversation with myself:  'Ok, now if I was Kensie and it was the middle of a night of pleasure that was just interrupted by a phone call, maybe I, forgetting that a genius killer has threatened or killed everybody in my circle of friends, would have unhesitatingly answered the front door at 2:00 in the morning.'  Of course there is more to it than that, but I felt like I was a step or two ahead of the detective through out the book, \\"Dude, you better send somebody over to protect that kid\\".  It felt like Lehane was creating suspense for the reader that the main character was oblivious to.  It required effort from me to justify the detective's stupidit... um... perspective.  <br />Regardless, `Darkness, Take My Hand' is a good, fun book.	2003-01-15

US	50169605	R2JLHV7KVTPNCH	0451203054	281774869	Praying for Sleep	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Nicely Layered Suspense	Jeffery Deaver always makes sure to create multiple layers of suspense and does it very well. The weather alone in 'Praying for Sleep' is a very effective layer. A clear, bright unseasonably warm November evening is threatening to turn into the storm of the century and you see, feel, and smell it coming.  The humid silence before the storm becomes increasingly dark and creates a vivid backdrop for the impending. As the water levels creep higher and begin sloshing over the lake dam on a property adjacent to Lis Atcheson's, a series of events in other various New England locations occur. It's freaking ominous! Man, all the lady wants to do is save her roses from the flood! <br />Deaver has a good method for filling in details evenly over four or five subplots as the story progresses. Yeah, filling in details for four or five subplots takes time which can feel like slow going at parts of the story. But I prefer an author to err on the side of too much significant detail than one to cut out information assuming I'm not interested, so it's mostly ok by me. You know how some subplots are less interesting and you can't wait to get back to the characters you really care about? That just seems to happen, but I'll say that Deaver fleshed out all the subs well enough to keep them meaningful, suspenseful, and necessary. Most notably, I enjoyed every scene at the Atcheson house and felt the paranoid schizophrenic Hrubek was a very well developed character.<br />Writing a review lets you relive the story. I'm finding that I am effortlessly getting right back into the feel/mood of the story that I finished reading three weeks ago. That's a good sign. A very good sign.	2002-12-02

The exasperating situation of being framed and having nowhere to turn was really felt throughout.  The characters were likeable.  Overall a fun fast read, until...  the end.  Maybe I didn't want the suspense to end.<br />The last 40 pages when the chase is wrapping up and the conspirators were revealed, I just lost interest.  The suspense and build up was great, the action sequence at the end was bland.  I say 6 out of 10 because I did enjoy the story for about 90% of it's pages, but the end was just too flat to say it was a great story.	2002-11-23

Is the story complex or muddled?  Is the writing style brilliant or ponderous?  Is the plot intertwined with unexpected surprises that challenge the reader to keep up, or is it just plain vague?  I asked myself these questions often when I read a Ludlum novel, but I never stop being completely absorbed, challenged and entertained.  <br />It's been several years since I have read Ludlum.  It's good to be back.  The international spy genre is fascinating because seemingly small people and inconsequential events can bring about cataclysmic results.  I loved 'Thirteen Days' (the movie).  There was no action but the dilemma and subtle decision making created an intense build up.  My favorite Tom Clancy novel... 'Cardinal of the Kremlin'.  Small seemingly inconsequential bits of information extracted from the Kremlin and we have a rip roaring adventure.  Ludlum is just like that.  The plot can be subtle, but it requires lots of conspiracy and heavy action in order to divert worldwide disaster.  <br />I could pick this story apart and possibly find holes, but is that Ludlum's fault or did I not read diligently enough.  I mean, how did the title underground organization exist for so long, then make unnecessary errors that nearly brought about its demise?  But then, who in the underground organization was working against the underground organization?  Who in the upper echelons of international governments are working against the people they serve?  Who is friend? Foe? Trustworthy?  <br />Robert Ludlum has just the right muddled, ponderous, vague method to deliver a surprising, brilliant, complex story.  Always a fun challenge!	2002-11-22

The often present suspicion hanging around Lucas at the end of a case, is masterfully handled.  While Lucas is assuaging his conscience, his peers hold the hush, information leaks strategically to the press, and politicians praise the department for the way the case was handled although everybody knows something wasn't quite right.  Mission accomplished.  Justice served.<br />Once again... beautiful.  <br />Think about it.  Sandford doesn't start out with anything new.  A serial murder and an investigation.  Lots of people write that.  Sanford just writes it right.  He is a master of leading and feeding the mind of the reader.  He leaves no stone unturned, no twist unraveled, and no question unanswered.  Timing is flawless.  The balance between plots and between characters, perfect.  <br />This time we get the subtle, strong character of out of town Deputy Terry Marshall tagging along, stepping up when the heat is on, and stepping in to flip steaks on the barbee.  Marshall is obscurely and perfectly developed for his supporting role here.  Lucas and Del never give an opinion of Marshall.  They more than tolerate him accompanying them on the case, but Sandford leaves it to the reader to form the opinion.  Then we get Weather's opinion at the exact perfect time.<br />There aren't any words strong enough to describe the quality of John Sandford's writing.  If you find a 'weakness', it is there deliberately.  If you find a hole... Forget it! You're not gonna find a hole!  Sandford could write Lucas Davenport all the way into the nursing home and it will be a blast!	2002-11-21

I haven't been a big reader of westerns, but I have been wanting to do some historical reading.  'Desert Gold' interested me because it was a western that covered the times that it was published in: 1913.  <br />The characters are just good people surviving a harsh environment, protecting whatever and whoever they can.  It took me a while to get my mind adjusted to Zane Grey's style of writing, but I really enjoyed everything about it.  This is a unpretentious story of finding root, pursuit, escape and survival and it provides a medium for Zane Grey to get philosophical on us during long dusty nights in the desert.  Although it may have bogged down a little, I liked the philosophical.  Always have.  The book has a satisfying ending even if it did finish a little cleaner than it was set up to do.<br />I read this in the 1964 paperback edition, but it would be great in audio!	2002-11-21

I was not mistaken.  Well, considering it starts out in Aunt Pol's kitchen and the story progresses through the eyes of a young Garion, it's fitting.  <br />'Pawn of Prophecy', on it's own, may not be much, but it is a nice set up.  Even though I have not yet read further in The Belgariad, I can say it had to start right here. A coming of age tale of an unsuspecting farm boy who loves legends and stories, it's not an overly exciting book, but a quick, comfortable, and relaxing read.  <br />David Eddings has a real grasp on maintaining a very diverse set of background and personality in his characters.  From the inexperience and youth of Garion, to the power and impatience of Aunt Pol, the power and nonchalance of Mr. Wolf, the strong simple Durnik, and of course, the constant comedic conniving of Silk, each character is consistent.  <br />Slow at times but this book is everything I expected and wanted it to be!	2002-11-15

The characters are great and the situations Beau puts himself into are quite entertaining.  All the way up to the last 30 pages I was waffling between a four or five star rating.  The ending just didn't work for me.  I've never been a fan of the bad guy thinking he's got the upper hand spills his guts to the cop ending.  That knocked me back to 3.5 stars.<br />That said, Judith Jance really has something going on.  It was fun riding along with the investigation, meeting the suspects, attending events uninvited to harass politicians.  Something that I particularly enjoyed was that the list of suspects was assembled complete with negative perspective and suspicion and then as Beaumont moves through the list, the suspicion dissipates and we meet every day likeable people.  Well done.<br />There were some very funny and creatively developed scenes that went a long way toward establishing me as a fan of J. A. Jance.  The word-picture memory trick was hilarious.  And the Pasco police chief's office as well as the Mary Kay convention were stand out scenes.	2002-11-15

It's quite fun.  Good characters.  Strong writing.  I wonder if I maybe should oughta shift gears here and pick up a new genre for a while.  The best way to describe my experience:  I just couldn't bond with the book.<br />The characters are well developed, but I didn't find myself caring a lot about them.  Angie Gennaro was probably my favorite character.  Patrick Kenzie seems to lack patience and a sense of humor.  Kenzie explores some of the ghosts of his past, anger toward his father, attempts to understand racism.  Some of the explorations work, some don't.  We don't get any real answers, there aren't any.  Lehane's way of keeping it real and I appreciate that, although some of Kenzie's self analysis and heated discussions about racism felt manufactured.  I will have to agree with the reviewers who say 'Preachy'.  Quite a bit of action, which I will have to agree with the reviewer who said cartoonish.  So there is some strong writing, but you can certainly see my reservations.<br />I'm going three stars because I believe the book is better than I what I put into it.  At least I hope so.  I WILL read the others.  And I hope that with familiarity I will be able become more involved in Lehane's writing.	2002-11-07
US	50169605	R32WYIGP06HA4P	0425178765	323998329	Easy Prey	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Slightly less than 5 stars on the Sandford scale	I may have an advantage over a lot of Sandford fans... I was introduced to him earlier this year. I have had 13 completed novels all lined up to read in rapid succession. One episode after the other. Each episode differs, some more fun than others, but each one is a faultless delivery which wins Sandford five stars every time. <br />Sandford is such a rewarding read. He anticipates the reader's thoughts and flawlessly adds information that confirms those thoughts with impeccable timing. I'm not saying that Sandford is at all predictable. He simply involves you in the story, gets you thinking with the characters, and then rewards you by affirming your awareness. <br />For example, Davenport is called out of bed at 5:00 AM. Thirty pages later, the scene is mid morning in Chief Rose Marie Roux's office. I, the reader, am thinking, \\"Davenport is running on 3 hours of sleep. He's gotta be tired\\". Not only that, I know Davenport is not an early riser. Chief Roux, in conversation with Lucas, pulls her cheeks back and makes mention of a face lift just as the Mayor walks through the door. \\"What?\\" the mayor says. And here we get a most memorable and beautifully crafted paragraph capping a brilliant scene... '\\"Face lift.\\" Lucas said. He yawned; he liked late nights, but not early mornings.' (P. 42)<br />To plot out and deliver a story is one thing and, considering the majority of failures that make it to publication, a very difficult thing. But an author that can not only wrap a story, but ties together the thoughts of the reader throughout each scene of the book and does so with characters that have become so familiar that you actually know their fictional thoughts, is beyond amazing. <br />Don't try to mislead me to one of your 'surprise' endings Sidney Sheldon. I can't enjoy good writing when the plot/subplots aren't held together, Mr. Kellerman. Sandford makes it seem too easy. Be smooth. Connect the big dots to make a cohesive plot and add a few small lines for detail, fun and consistency in between. <br />Here's another one... Lucas is slipping along Minnesota back roads and, on arrival at the crime scene, Sloan asks the same thing I, the reader, have been wondering. <br />Sloan anxiously: \\"What did you drive out here? ...I'm driving back.\\"	2002-11-05
US	50169605	RH0ZHBRSJP3RT	0451205421	835415534	The Door to December	Books	3	0	3	N	N	Nice 'n' Creepy	I'm a big Dean Koontz fan! His work gets classified as horror, which makes it all the more appealing that this author emerges from his writing, as a highly philosophical and deeply moral man. <br />Koontz writes some of the best characters, because he knows these characters. He is these characters. He delves into the darkness of human nature and creates a villain. Then he creates a hero that balances between an ideological existence and a very dark reality and arrives... human. Scathed, beaten, stronger.<br />No Dean Koontz novel is ever wasted (not even a page) and I intend to read everything he has written. 'Door to December' is a good story and one of the creepier Koontz novels that I have read. It is also the weakest Koontz novel that I have read. Unfortunately there isn't the distinctly defined villain, that Koontz does so well, because... well you can read about that. I could not get involved with Laura or Melanie probably because no real relationship developed between them and any of the other characters. There were plenty of strange happenings and elements of the investigation were intriguing, but I don't know, as a whole, something just didn't gel. It just felt like an interesting story that wasn't fully developed. The abrupt ending makes me feel like the whole project may have been rushed. Very cool title by the way especially when you discover what it applies to.<br />Funny, as I read other reviews lots of people find this to be the best ever. I'm glad to hear that. Koontz is worthy. I think the difference for me is that my favorites are those with a human villian. 'From the Corner of His Eye', 'Dark Rivers of the Heart', 'Servants of Twilight'. Koontz invests so much of himself into his writing that you really get to know him as a person and this book is not an exception. If I met him on the street, I would expect to pick up as old friends. I trust this guy and... he even looks like my dad.	2002-10-18

Very promising.  I liked the introduction to the characters and the set up that will allow readers to hopefully bond with J.P. Beaumont and Detective Ron Peters as they learn to work together as newly partnered Homicide detectives.  There was some fun dialog and situations and the slow elevator provides for several amusing incidents.  Occasionally I would start to suspect whodunit (just like Beaumont) and then my suspicions would be allayed (just like Beaumont).  That was pretty nicely done.  Surprisingly, to me the ending was quite a satisfying wrap even though many a book with a similar ending has left me very disgruntled.<br />Midway through, I was concerned.  A lot of focus was placed on Beau's whirlwind romantic relationship.  If characters in a book can be said to have chemistry it would NOT be these two, although they did become more believable in the end.  There was a fairly lengthy section where I was rather disengaged, wedding showers, shopping, setting up house, suspicion, and &quot;Isn't there a guy named Beau in on of those mid-day soaps called 'Days of our Lives'?&quot;.  I began to loose faith.  Then a so-so grand finale and, surprise surprise, a thorough and believable enough wrap up to make me almost forget the tedium.<br />I remember being reluctant when I started Sanford's 'Prey' series and I have been COMPLETELY won over there.  If we can build up from this one, Jance may develop another fan.	2002-10-18

The words in this book are so well placed that the readers mind is filled with the mind of the Author.  I'd say that's a good thing for a diary.  The characters are well developed.  One of the strongest elements though, is the conversations complete with voice inflection, emotion and unspoken thoughts.  I always enjoy a conversation or situation that is so well worded that I can visualize it happening.  Many times I sprouted a smile that didn't quit for hours or days afterwards. <br />The story is one of a rich woman who works so hard to maintain an appearance of high society, to the expense of her dignity and decency, that she cannot maintain a relationship with anyone including her 4 year old son.   The story works because it is told through the eyes of the nanny who is an accomplished student until she is completely consumed by the demands of her 'superior'.  This story is a justification for those lower-middle class folk who take comfort in their blue collar origins.  (the thought popped into my head at least.)   <br />A book called 'The Nanny Diaries' may not be one that a 32 year old guy would normally pick up, and though I take pride in being versatile reader, I probably would have missed this one.  My primary criteria for a good book, believable characters, situations, and dialog, were nicely met. And, being the audio version, having Julia Roberts reading to me on the drive to and from work for a few days was quite enjoyable.  <br />I've tried to keep this review of this audio book separated into two parts: the book, and the reader, Ms. Roberts.  I'm not sure how well I've done.  The pairing was perfect.  Julia had good material to work with, but the attitude and masterful characterization she delivers took the story to a higher level.  In my opinion, Julia makes whatever she is handed shine.  But this reading stepped my appreciation of her up yet another notch and brings her back to the front of my mind as a top performer and this was a top performance.	2002-10-17
US	50169605	R1Y9442XSUIJPE	0425174271	51899905	Certain Prey	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Another Winner	This book has some of the far-fetched, convenient 'coincidences' that in another author's hands, would have failed miserably.  But not Sanford's.   He works everything into the story so convincingly that instead of a wrap up at the end of the book to explain who done it and how, we get a comfortable and casual conclusion as Sanford coasts to the end of another winner.  Of course a winner from Sanford is no longer expected on the onset of a new episode it is confirmed beforehand.  With so many best selling authors, it is quite obvious that elements of the plot have been resolved in the author's head without being written down for the reader.  John Sanford is so thorough in translating his thoughts to paper that we are not left with unexplained holes and more importantly not insulted by obligatory explanations to fill in said holes.  What Sanford has done here is an amazing success.  <br />Clara Rinker is my favorite Sanford villain yet and one I actually didn't mind spending time with.  I was actually pulling for her.  The very elaborate murder series and ensuing cover up was so meticulous that it had me thinking Sanford should be careful before he becomes a consultant for hit men everywhere.  All of the characters, including the villains, are fun.  And the dialog... well if I start itemizing it would get repetitious.  An outstanding piece of work.	2002-09-04

Theone's characters and events are so convincing that it seemed I could feel and understand the era. The pure evil is vivid enough to keep you angry while the romance truly soars with some very well written pictures and emotion. It is like she was able to inhabit each character and scene as she wrote. <br />The emotions, events, and relationships during this historical period are experienced here so that you can't help but trust the accuracy of this work. Although a couple of times we are taken out of the story for a short history lesson, I felt that the historical facts were perfectly placed throughout the story. <br />I was amazed by one scene where Theone captures Nazi Field Marshal Hermann Goring's jealously of Theo Lindheim. 'Goring was... the glutton of the Reich. What he saw, his appetite demanded. He had not admired the honor of Theo Lindheim, but he had coveted the respect Lindheim's honor seemed to bring him. The contrast between the two men was an impassable gulf... One thing was certain, someone like Hermann Goring would never fill the shoes of Theo Lindheim...he would try...then he would strip the house bare of everything of beauty and value... (p. 154)' This childish lust for power and the total inadequacy as a person portrayed here translated into a perfect picture of Hitler himself.<br />One problem I did have... the dialog and interaction between characters was a little weak and unnatural at times which was a surprising to me given the outstanding strength of every other element of the book. <br />What a discovery! It makes you wish every book could be written so well. I didn't want it to end because it is going to be a few weeks before I get to start the next one.	2002-09-03

I was completely into the first 80 pages of this book.  His characters and relationships are well developed in the beginning and I was ready for another great series.  But once the plot takes hold, the focus turns away from the characters and becomes a tedious investigation that conveniently results in an implausible outcome.<br />I guess what I'm saying is that Kellerman is a great writer, but not quite the story teller I was hoping to find.  I would have preferred that more time was spent with the core characters, and the plot was kept simple.  As it turns out, the core characters may as well have not been developed because they weren't used after they were introduced.  The plot plods on.  Note: Every bad guy does Not have to be related in order to complete a story.  Go ahead and leave some loose ends, just make sure the loose ends are intentional and not there because an important character (Milo) was forgotten.  Or, unless you're Larry McMurtry, keep it simple so the story can be resolved naturally.  (Read 'Lonesome Dove' to see a perfectly successful ending that has no resolution.  All ends are left loose.  Do I digress?)<br />I may have read this book while I was half asleep which wouldn't be fair.  But then again, I may have been half asleep because I was reading this book.  As I got closer to the end, I became more convinced that the latter was true.  I could not wait to get it over with.  I will take into account that this was a debut book and intend to give the next 2 or 3 books in this series a run before I write it off.  I've already been disappointed by one 'Billy Straight' by the same author (published in 1998) so I just don't know if this is going to work for me.	2002-08-16

The characters are so completely enjoyable.  The situations heart rending yet so vividly described that it is entertaining/amusing.<br />The story is not so much amusing because it is humorous.  The smile is pure amazement over Steinbeck's ability to create this work where I could be a first hand witness to the characters and events.  Some situations are laugh-out-loud funny although serious.  Even the tragic events bring a smile and a lump to your throat at the same time.  Every page pulled at my heart, my mind, and my face.

The author is a master. The writing is effortless and unpretentious. The reading is involving and realistic. Once again the characters live and the dialog amuses. And once again, Sandford does not create artificial suspense so that he can attempt to surprise you in the end. The events unfold simply and naturally.

Rich in it's sparcity.  Such a solid bunch of characters and impeccable dialog is rare.  I've taken to scoring the way a story like this handles death and this book deals with it many times and the same sparce beauty comes through in a completely new and unique way each time.  We get to see brief, but perfectly timed moments of introspection, usually courtesy of Gus, of the journey through life, the joys and regrets, and the pride/shame associated with 'taming' the land.  The reader is a part of the journey, part of the changing landscape and part of the joy and the regrets.  At the end of the drive, I wanted to return with Captain Call to correct some of life's mishaps, but had to resign myself to the fact that what's done is done and there ain't no changin' it.  Each character has their own personality and uniqueness that is a pleasure to meet and get acquainted with.  McMurtry never wasted time building suspense into a situation or event.  The event simply occurs and you smile as you ride on down the road.  If at all possible, the last 50 pages should be read in one sitting.  At the end you will want to be alone for several hours where nobody will disturb the end of your journey.	2002-07-24

I have much respect for this author who can write what would easily become cliché, but provides enough variety that the series read in sequence creates a very good ongoing story. The event in this book wasn't quite as fun for me as others in the series, but the story still unfolds in the solid realistic tale that I have come to expect from Sandford. Even though I don't rate this book as high as his others, within the context of the whole series, Sandford's work holds my highest appreciation. What specifically brought down the 'fun factor' in this book was that it spent more time with the bad guys and less with Lucas and company. The Davenport angle is what makes the books for me.	2002-07-24

I enjoyed learning about the history, landscape and mindset of the South's upper crust society.  <br />I liked the strength of Page who bridged the gap between upper class White society and African American discrimination. I appreciated her gradual realization that, while she 'did not' discriminate, she had a white mentality that affected her view of black people.  It was good to see her experience racial discrimination first hand.<br />Overall though, I felt that characters weren't always very well developed (I mean, what did Page ever see in that Governor puke), dialog was unnatural and weak, and while the ending was satisfying, it wrapped up into the nice little package that I predicted halfway through the book but with one surprise.	2002-07-24

But the story was a bit weak. The situations and resolutions were a bit too convenient. Flipping back and forth between the sub plots was ok, but they didn't cohere very well. Billy Staight's situation had little contribution in the end. The Ramsey investigation was small. What did Stu's character have to do with anything other than an attempt to show a considerate, domestic side of Petra. I really expected Stu to play a major role but he became unnecessary to the story. So some of the sub plots went nowhere.

He knows each one so well. The characters are introduced, we get first impressions, form opinions, and then gradually become acquainted then familiar with them. And what an incredible ride to be carried along with Junior Cain, for half the book, seeing the world from his point of view, practically empathizing with the man. Gradually we become aware just how fractured this self improved man is. As new characters are developed we get to observe Cain from a new vantage point. <br />I, for one, was glad that Junior's haunting was not supernatural. I much prefer believablity to a 'ghost' story.  The fun was being lead to believe one thing, watching Junior develop (or come apart), and then learning the source of his distress.<br />Barty's supernatural talents added a nice build up although in the end I completely lost interest in the whole quantum physics/parallel world angle. <br />The gory hospital scenes in the first 100 pages were grueling and the impending meeting between Barty and Cain materialized  into a coincidence (a non-event), but the fact is... I was so overwhelmed with the unfolding of the characters in this story that I can hardly give it anything but a perfect score. Length could have been trimmed a bit so let's go 9/10.<br />I finished this book last week and today I am half way through my first James Patterson novel. I guess it isn't fair to Patterson. My mind is still so involved with the Junior Cain/Thomas Vanadium conflict, that I'm missing the 'Jack and Jill' adventure.	2002-01-02
