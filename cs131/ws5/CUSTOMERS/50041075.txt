US	50041075	R22ECX3W454NTJ	1576738507	955618283	On Every Side	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Amazing!	I absolutely loved &quot;On Every Side&quot;!  Once again Karen Kingsbury has written a book that, in the beginning, things look hopeless, but by the end, you feel completely fulfilled with how everything turns out.<br />&quot;On Every Side&quot; is about two people who are fighting for a statue of Jesus; one person, Faith, who will do anything to keep the statue where it is, and an attorney, Jordan, who is dedicated to fighting anything that has to do with Christianity or God.  However, when Jordan begins his battle, he doesn't realize who his main opposition will be: Faith, his best friend from years ago.<br />As always with Karen Kingsbury's books, you feel as though you know the characters and are a part of the book.  And while Jordan appears to be the enemy, you learn about his painful past and why he is determined to fight against God.  I loved all the main characters- they were just wonderful!  This was such a likeable book.  Once I began reading it, I couldn't put it down!  There is also an interesting connection between the names of many characters and the Bible, which comes out later in the book.<br />If you've read other books by this author, you won't be disappointed with &quot;On Every Side&quot;.  Or if this author is new to you, read this book and you'll probably be hooked!  I highly recommend reading this book!	2003-08-18
US	50041075	R3IWCONMH4F4UF	1576732851	979552886	Where Yesterday Lives	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Good book	Where Yesterday Lives was a good book, but not my favorite by Karen Kingsbury.  While I thought her other books were amazing, this one got a little more tedious.  However, the end was terrific.  On the other hand, I found the characters very realistic.  When the Barrett kids were young, they got along really well.  As they grew older, they changed, and their relationships deteriorated as their problems came between them.  As their stories were told, I found myself feeling sympathetic for them and understanding each one's individual problems.  It was as if I was right there, which is what can make a book really great.  And it also showed me what can happen when a family doesn't work to stay together.  <BR>I think the only thing that got slightly monotonous was the constant fighting between the siblings.  This book only takes place over one week, and when there was so much obvious tension, I began skipping ahead to see when things would finally change.  Also, the book is supposed to be mainly about Ellen, but there were many pages about her siblings, which was also necessary to learn about their past.  And though I wasn't completely happy with some parts of this book, by the end I was satisfied.  And I think anyone who reads this book will finish it feeling satisfied and perhaps even looking at how their own life can change.  After all, this book is really about families and love, and how great families really are!	2003-07-27

Like the last few books in this series, I have to say that this one is so good! Things just continue to look up for everyone in Prime Eight.<br />If you're familiar with the series, it's not hard to say that you seem to know each character. However, in this book, I felt myself feeling proud of some characters- like Jesse, for how he seems to have cleaned up his life, and Miguel buying a house for his family. I felt happy for Melanie, who especially has faced difficult times in the past. All that seems to be changing, as she has found happiness with Jesse, her father has quit drinking, and she's gotten to know more of her family. Even Nicole, despite her constant obsession to lose weight, it showing a glimmer of hope that she might change her attitude about somethings- maybe.<br />Though this is a Christian series, Peter and Jenna have really been the only ones to practise their faith. However, besides Melanie's increased interest in the Bible, Leah has also started to question some facts she has always known as science. Since one of the reasons I was originally interested in this series was because of it's Christian content, I was pleased to read in this book how at least there is somewhat of a Christian focus.<br />If you're a fan of the Clearwater Crossing series, this book is a fantastic- and welcome- addition. My only disappointment was how is seemed to focus on particular characters. Ben, though not the most interesting, was hardly mentioned, and Peter also was more in the background this time. However, it was still a terrific read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!	2001-08-07

Out of all the books in the Clearwater Crossing series, this one seems to be the most positive.  It was so uplifting and inspiring and encouraging to read!  I just couldn't believe how well so many things worked out... finally!<br />It's starting to look like Ben's finally going to find a girlfriend- maybe.  Ben is quite a lot more visible in this book than he has been lately in the others.  School is out, so everyone can relax without the pressures of school.  Nicole gets lucky when somebody starts paying attention to her, and her efforts to make friends with the other cheerleaders are almost too much.  Every time I read about her, I think she really needs an attitude adjustment.  And Jesse and Melanie are finally together- maybe.  Is happiness for them just too much to hope for?  Leah and Miguel go to great lengths to keep secrets from each other, while Jenna is itching to tell Leah she saw Miguel with that sneaky Sabrina.  Everything just kept me at the edge of my seat.  I couldn't put the book down until the end!<br />If you're like me and absolutely hooked with the Clearwater Crossing series, this book won't disappoint you!  This is also a great series for any teen girls that I would strongly recommend.  They're almost like Sweet Valley High with a Christian twist, and much more meaningful reading.  I give Just Say Yes a big Yes!	2001-03-25

I have never enjoyed mysteries much, but the Trixie Belden books are a winner with me.  My mom found this one at the library and I wouldn't touch it at first because of the ugly cover, but after a few peeks I was hooked!  They're so fascinating anyone who loves to read anything will absolutely absorb these books, and I'm sure even someone who's not too excited about reading will have a hard time putting these down!  They are so complete and realistic; not at all like some trashy incomplete books available that have no depth.  Trixie and her friends are wonderful role models for all kids and even adults, and these books offer good, clean reading that are impossible to stay away from.  My biggest problem is that they are no longer published and very difficult to get.  I definitely would recommend these books and encourage any kids or teens to read them.	2001-03-22

While I thought of Rahab as a special person who did a good deed, Francine Rivers draws the reader in to see how Rahab fit into God's plan, and how she drastically changed her life because of her craving to follow God.  You feel like you're there- as if you are actually seeing the things Rahab did, and feeling the intensity of her deep desire to know the Lord.  At the end of the book there's even a part for discussion in Bible studies that prods even an individual to search for an evaluation of their own spiritual life.<br />I loved this story!  It's every bit as good as you can expect.  Francine Rivers writes with such depth you can't help but stay glued to the end, even if you know how the story goes in the Bible.  What I especially liked was how differently I viewed Rahab when I was finished reading.  This book completely can change your perspective on her uniqueness.  Her unshakeable faith, as a new believer with no support from any family or friends, inspired and encouraged me, as someone who has been raised in a Christian family, and opened my eyes to God's power to do anything and His ability to use anyone.  Check this book out!	2001-02-18

In my opinion, &quot;Wednesday's Child&quot; is the best book in the series.  Unlike the first two, which are set in Europe during WWII, this book takes place in America at the time of the Great Depression.  Sharlotte, who is a Wednesday's Child, is introduced to the reader as a spoiled, flirting nineteen year old who is aware of her beauty, stable financial situation and social level, and her likely upcoming engagement to a wealthy, promising man.  If you're hoping for some quick action, you won't be disappointed.  A murder, a dashing rival from Sharlotte's past, and the stock market crash set the pace for an exciting book.  Linda Chaikin also does a wonderful job bringing all the characters to life for the reader, as well as coming through with the Christian context expected.  I found the characters easy to understand and relate to.  The plot was very well developed, with an abundance of excitement and adventure.  I was intrigued for the duration of the book!<br />Like another reviewer, I agree that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and &quot;the wild west&quot; scenarios are reflected in &quot;Wednesday's Child&quot;.  This book is sure to delight many readers; thrilling and mysterious, romantic, historic- these all make an awesome book.  It's definitely worth the 400+ page read!!	2001-02-08

They even repeat theconversations from the books.<br />We already know what the girls arelike- Jenna tries to be kind and patient, Nicole is obsessed with herappearance and weight, Melanie is nice but misunderstood, and Leahdoesn't care about being a model but is just interested in hereducation.  Basically, that's what you read in the diary.  Nicole, whoI find a bit tiring, had the least interesting diary, but in Melanie'sdiary, you find out a bit more about how lonely and sad she really issometimes.  Jenna's diary offers her perspective about the beginningof Eight Prime, and Leah's diary was my favorite because I likeher.<br />I can't say the diary was boring, because it's not.  However,it's not worth buying unless you want to collect the entire series. Iwould just recommend trying to get a copy from a friend or out of thelibrary.	2001-01-24
US	50041075	R23GQR0QSMVE1B	0553492322	243407590	The Big Night (Sweet Valley High No. 142)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Action Packed!	This book definitely has a lot of action in it!  I didn't read book 141, so I started reading to find out almost from the beginning about a new feud between Jessica and Lila, Jessica and Elizabeth, and who else but one involving Devon, Todd, and Courtney.<br />Lila and Jessica had both wanted to go to the prom with the same guy, so they agreed that neither would go with him.  As it turns out, both went behind each other's backs and planned to go with him anyway.  As you can imagine, things got rather heated when they made that discovery and he ditched them both, leaving both without a date. Next, due to a mix up on Jessica's part, Elizabeth and Devon's plans for the prom go all wrong and Liz ends up going with Todd after all.  Unknown to anyone but Lila, Jessica does the twin switch and meets Devon. Meanwhile, Courtney is outraged when Todd calls to say he's not going with her after all.  The creepy little rat ends up ruining everything for several of the people at the prom.<br />In my opinion, as much as I like (and feel sorry for) Devon, I think he should have either left Elizabeth alone rather than be so demanding and impose himself on her and almost force her into the mess she gets into, or maybe he should have left Sweet Valley completely.  And though Todd seems a little boring sometimes, I feel sorry that he has to be put through everything he does.  After all, it always has been Liz and Todd.  Courtney is a spoiled brat that should be taught a lesson for once and for all. As for Jess and Liz... I love the action, but why can't they stay out of trouble for a while?!<br />This book was really exciting!  Definitely a true SVH book.  All the fighting makes the reader think about what's going on and develop feelings about each character.  I was just a little disappointed that Jessica and Elizabeth couldn't have a perfect night to remember, but I guess in these books that never happens!  You have to read this book if you enjoy following the series or if you like toread about never ending rivalry :)	2001-01-22

Maybe Lila is being framed for the fire, but she certainly is guilty when it comes to her unprofessional relationship with Steven.<br />Part of Fowler Crest has burned down in a fire- and too much evidence against Lila is starting to look suspicious.  Since her parents are away with no way to contact them, Lila becomes vulnerable, looking at Steven as a knight in shining armor when Steven is supposed to be investigating the case.  How could Steven become so attracted to spoiled Lila, even if she is so seemingly helpless?<br />Okay, so that was a dumb little fling between them, but the book was exciting.  Aren't most of the SVH books?  When so much evidence started pointing at Lila, I almost believed she was guilty.  Maybe that's a little farfetched, but it didn't look to good for her.<br />If you're looking for an in depth, soul searching book, perhaps this book isn't too well suited for your needs, but if you're like me and have enjoyed reading this series, read this one too!  It's full of excitement and action!	2001-01-22

I was a fan of the show, and just like everyone else, wanted to find out what interesting tidbits were in this book.<br />To be honest, I have to agree with the reviewers who say Mark Burnett spent too much time describing the weather and the water and the sky and other things that not exactly what I was interested in.  For example, there's a paragraph about Rich going fishing, and there's more written about the water and Rich's almost artistic method of attacking the fish than I was interested in reading.  Tribal councils, challenges, and rewards are covered in a few brief paragraphs, and I was disappointed to find how the final tribal council, the most important one of all, was no better than the rest.  What did I learn about the survivors?  To tell the truth, I think I learned more about the crew and &quot;chief&quot; Jeff than the people in the tribes.  True, it was interesting to read about the interaction of crew that of course we don't see on TV, but it was the survivors I wanted to know more about.<br />Don't get me wrong- this book had some good parts.  Some of the conversations we don't hear on TV are included, and there are a lot of little things such as how the show continued despite the dangerous weather, or how Jenna did eventually get her video and how she blamed the crew for not getting it right away, and how Kelly's restaurant reward was created.  <br />I wouldn't ever buy this book, but if you can borrow it, or get from the library, it's got some interesting parts in it.  Don't get your hopes up, because it isn't as fantastic as the show.  I recommend reading this book only if you don't have to buy it.	2001-01-14

Is this the eighth wonder of the world?  When I started reading this book and found out that Jessica had supposedly turned into a genius, I wasn't able to put it down without finding out how everything turned out.  Especially since Elizabeth received such low marks, which appeared very suspicious.  I was a little disappointed that you never find out exactly what happened- besides it just being a fluke.<br />I enjoyed this book too because of everyone else's attitudes and reactions.  Ken doesn't believe Jessica when she tells him what her marks are, and he admits that his expectations of Jessica were much lower, which understandably upsets Jessica.  Todd is so arrogant for most of the book because of the attention he's receiving from the basketball scouts that I thought he needed a good slap.  However, I liked it when Elizabeth ditched and abandoned him at the beach.  Elizabeth's trial for Jessica was neat to read about as well as adding some interest and common sense and showed how the twins' friendship stays true most of the time.<br />Though I found that there was less action in this book, it was also a nice relaxing break from some of the competition, trickery, and fast pace of some other books in the series.  It's definitely not a classic, but for readers who are fans of SVH, you shouldn't be disappointed.	2001-01-05

Tried and True, like the rest of the Clearwater Crossing books, is another awesome addition to the series.  I just got the book and wasn't able to put it down.  <br />Eight Prime is finally getting closer to fulfilling their dream of having summer camp.  They still have to finish the necessary safety courses, but with all the goofing off, Jenna is afraid they're never going to pass.  While Jenna and Peter are devoted to the summer camp preparations, Nicole is attempting to establish herself as a cheerleader, Miguel is obsessed with work, work, work, and Leah is doubtful about her future.  Melanie, frustrated with getting Jesse back and uncertain about her choice of dropping out of cheerleading, can't seem to make much progress with anything.  And Ben is just Ben.<br />There's not a dull moment in this book as the eight are trying to have fun preparing for summer holidays amid their struggles.  Whether it's Leah questioning Miguel's attitude or Nicole trying to be popular, this book was great to read.  It was funny, thoughtful, and intriguing.  I definitely recommend it anyone who enjoys this series or looking for a fun new realistic series to read.	2000-12-29

In order for it to make sense, you have to read all the other books in the series first, though.  What made it so good?  First of all, it was very up to date.  This book showed how violence is becoming very present in the world.  Even the small town Nikki lives experiences threats and violence in the school.  This added both a thrilling dimension as well as the feeling that the author is not ignoring modern problems.  Second, the reader finally gets to meet T.J, the father of Nikki's baby.  He was totally different than I expected, and Nikki's struggles with how to face- and forgive- him were very obvious.  Finally, Nikki has to determine, or rather redefine, her relationship with Jeff.  When her grandparents become concerned about them, and her grades and other activities begin to reflect how she chooses her priorities,  it's clear that she has to change something.  I don't know if this is the last book in the series or not, but if it is, it is a very good conclusion when everything comes together at the end.  However, a sequel wouldn't be completely impossible.  There's still more that could be written about Jeff, and it would be nice to hear from T.J. again, then there's Hollis...<br />I couldn't find a flaw in this book.  Over the entire series the reader becomes very close to Nikki and can feel her trouble.  It's a wonderful series to read, and one I would highly recommend to any teenage girl who loves to read.	2000-12-27

It is the love story of two people who are meant to be together- or are they?  The only separating them from each other are their religious views.  I grew quite attached to the characters, and felt the moods of the book very well, even to the point of sympathy for Sara and Ethan sometimes!  If this book lacked anything, it was adventure, but the author did a wonderful job of staying on track, which made the book easy to follow.  The style was very interesting as well, almost like a letter or summary with every chapter.  Perhaps the story was slightly unrealistic- the characters almost put their lives on hold to follow a dream or their feelings, but it made a wonderful story.  If you enjoy a slower paced, contemplative, sweet story, this a book I would highly recommend.	2000-12-20

It was wonderful to be reunited with old characters, and I liked how this book was slightly different from many of Janette Oke's other books in time period and style.  Reading this book without the intent of being critical, this was a good book, and a must read for anyone who values Janette Oke's books.<br />However, to be perfectly fair and honest in my review, this book does have its flaws.  I felt as though I grew somewhat attached to Christine and Henry, but this book lacked some of the necessary material and substance that causes the reader to truly bond with the characters.  Furthermore, as much as I would love to say I enjoyed every aspect of this book, I was disappointed with Christine for her refusal to see sooner that Boyd wouldn't change.  Christine seemed to be a smart, bright girl, but why did the matter of Boyd's attitude seem to be slightly glossed over?  There was just something missing to make this a great book.  Finally, the book ended very abruptly, in my opinion.  Perhaps a sequal is in the making, but if not, Christine's story seemed to vanish near the end, leaving me feeling that her future, or even present, was unsolved.  Then with Henry and Sam, I felt totally lost in the abruptness of the ending.  Sure, I know what happened with them, but what about the void that gets them to where they are?<br />Despite my opinions (which provoked me to lower my rating to 3 stars), I still would recommend &quot;Beyone the Gathering Storm&quot; just because it was fun to read.	2000-12-16

For a less experienced pianist, the songs might be more challenging, but as an advanced pianist, I enjoyed being able to play numerous songs without a lot of practice.  The book has all the familiar carols, and almost any other carols and other Christmas pieces can be found in it.  The arrangments were familiar and delightful to play, free from some of the rather wierd versions available.  With the variety offered in this book, it is also suitable for recitals, church, parties, or anything at Christmas, and can be prepared with minimal work and much enjoyment.  This book is a valuable addition to any collection.	2000-11-23

As a big fan of Christy, I was pleased to find that this book takes place over a whole four months, and many of her old friends are included- and there are some big surprises there.  The whole book is just amazing and exciting, funny, romantic, and overall, just &quot;WOW&quot;.  Mrs. Gunn has an awesome talent.  However, no review is able to capture how great this book really is and the only way to find out is to read it yourself.  If you loved the Christy Miller books before, check out As You Wish.

So, I was a little confused in the beginning of this book.  Consider reading book 95 first.<br />My thoughts about this book were first about Jessica's selfishness, which is no surprise, and the unfairness of Elizabeth's situation.  However, it was a good page turner.  Elizabeth has been arrested for involuntary murder of Sam, Jessica's boyfriend, and unknown to everyone is that Jessica spiked Elizabeth's punch.  I found Elizabeth's moodiness a little depressing, and I often wondered why Jessica didn't feel more guilty, but as the book progresses it improves.<br />Most exciting, and chilling, in this book is Margo.  Margo is a foster child who feels she deserves, after growing up in abusive situations, a happy life, a perfect family, people who love and care about her, you get the idea.  She makes her way towards SV, leaving a path of destruction behind her- and her evilness is absolutely chilling.<br />I liked this book, despite the fact that the book seemed a touch unrealistic.  But, hey, it makes good reading if you enjoy suspense, action, adventure, or anything like that.	2000-11-14

Like all the other books in the Left Behind the Kids series, this book is exciting and unpredictable.  As the series progresses, each book has more danger and risks.  What happens to Vicky at the detention center, and does Judd get his opportunity to speak at the graduation ceremony?  Of course you want to find out!!<br />This is a great Christian series, and for those who argue that it is totally unrealistic, I think it doesn't matter.  Who knows what will really happen?  These books challenge the reader to consider possible scenerios, and if you don't want to believe it,  the book still is great fiction.  Unlike many other books, that you know will turn out fine at the end, you know these books could have almost any possible ending.<br />At book 8, I'm finally realizing that with these books, expect anything to happen.  How the kids, particularly Judd, spread Christianity in this book surpised me so much, it almost didn't surprise me.  Expect the unexpected- but once you start reading you won't be able to put it down!	2000-11-13

This book was incredibly good, one of the main reasons being that the characters are so real.  Nicole, Miguel, Melanie, Leah, and Jesse seem to be featured mostly in this book, while the others are more in the background.  Just like the first fourteen books, Melanie and Jesse can't get along or come to some sort of truce, and pesky Courtney won't leave Nicole alone.  However, in &quot;What Goes Around&quot;, there are many surprises awaiting the reader about these four.  Then there's Miguel, who is still feeling the loss of his friend Zach.  If you've read other Clearwater Crossing books, you'll be aware of how moody Miguel can be, and the impact Zach's death has on Miguel is evidence of this.  This book is exciting and seems to move along more than many of the other books in this series.  I felt as though I got to know some of the characters better then ever, because this book brought out the deeper feelings of these characters.  This book also held many surprises and an unpredictable ending.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading a good book.	2000-10-15

It's hard to say much about this book without giving away anything important.  Picking up where book 6 left off, the four kids are right in the thick of the trouble because of their determination to bring the truth of Jesus Christ to... well, as far as they can.  However, things are getting riskier every day with the Global Community and all those who oppose Christianity.  In this captivating book it is important to predict who is trustworthy with so many people who are working hard to prevent the distribution of &quot;The Underground&quot; and find evidence against the kids behind it.  There are also more developments in Israel fulfilling Biblical prophesies, which lead to a quick trip to Israel for Judd.  Then there's Vicki, whose approach to the dangerous and difficult situations she numerously ends up in surprised me and added to the suspense.  This book was totally different than I expected it would be; the dangers are obviously increasing, but the incredible faith and determination of the kids allow them to take the risks- which lead to suprising endings.  This thrilling sequel is astonishingly real and something you don't want to miss!	2000-10-12

It's great  for high school aged readers (or just about everyone) because the main  character, Simon, is in high school, trying to fit in.  Simon hates being  the son of Interflux because his whole life he has been around Interflux,  and he seizes the opportunity to fight against Interflux. Not only is his  battle funny, his friends and classmates are all unique and interesting,  and his art teacher is hilarious and scary! I thoroughly enjoyed reading  this book and recommend it to anyone who likes other books by this author  or anyone interested in a good book.	2000-08-15

Whether you've read other Christy Miller books or not, here's a warning:  this book is way to good to put down! I loved this book!  It's full of  adventure and romance.  Christy is touring Europe with Katie and Todd, but  she's a bit unhappy from the beginning because she has a perfect first day  together planned so that they can all go on an enjoyable, organized trip  together.  Then, during their holiday, she feels uncertain about her  relationship with Todd.  Of course, sprinkled in this book are other  sometimes hilarious, sometimes serious episodes. Read this book- you won't  be disappointed!	2000-08-13

I haven't been able to put it down because it is so fasinating and captivating!  If you want an excellently written book that has explicit research, this book  is for you.  The characters are interesting and very real, whether it is  Catharine and George exploring Heathersleigh Hall, the McFees visiting, or  Amanda with her seemingly endless problems.  I studied World War I in  school this year and all the events that happened previously are in this  book, which makes the book very interesting for me as well.  There is  nothing in this book I did not like!  Read it yourself!	2000-07-11

I agree that some of the details were described a little too well, but Colleen is a normal person who is trying to overcome her running from God.  I especially  liked Colleen's friendship with Miss Lavender, as well as many other  characters.  This was a good book!	2000-06-03

Mark teaches April how to deal with her medical problems, and how to face life.   Mark and April are incredible characters, without being unrealistic.  They  seemed very real to me.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it  to anyone  who has enjoyed reading Lurlene McDaniel's books in the past.   Happy reading!	2000-04-08

It makes me think a lot more about the Rapture and how awful things will be- disasters, more crime, loneliness.  The main characters, Judd, Vicki, Lionel, and Ryan, have all  come from Christian homes where all their families were Christians and  raptured.  I found that the way this book was written made it easy to read.   This was a great book because it wasn't boring or difficult to read and it  made me think a lot more about my relationship with Christ.	2000-04-08

Lori Wick isn't my favorite author but for some reason I just love most of her books (especially the Kensington Chronicles).  I've often wondered how realistic the plot is, but that fairy tale sort of thing  I just loved.  I felt sorry for Shelby at times and couldn't put the book  down until I was done.  I hope you like The Princess as much as I did!	2000-03-17
