Ann Patchett released Bel Canto in 2001, but that doesn't make it any less appropriate of a summer read.<br />In the novel, the slightly corrupt but well-meaning government of an unnamed South American country throws a birthday party for a wealthy Japanese industrialist who is considering a large investment in the impoverished country.  However, the only way to ensure the attendance of Mr. Hosokawa is to hire Roxanne Coss, an American soprano and Hosokawa's private idol, to sing for the guests.<br />Everything proceeds according to plan until 18 poor, would-be terrorists quietly crash the party.  Their prey-the president-chose not to attend the party so he would not miss his favorite soap opera, so the hostages and the captors are thrown into a situation for which neither group planned.  Time stands still, and victims and victors live together peacefully and almost happily until they realize that time never really does stand still and that change is inevitable.<br />The hostages are an eclectic group at best; the Russian, Italian, French, American, and Japanese nationals have nothing in common except their peril, but Patchett weaves their personalities together so seamlessly it seems as if they are a large family, accustomed to living together and tolerating each other's quirks.<br />Bel Canto is meant to be savored, and Patchett's word choice and sentence structure cater to those who enjoy words for the sake of words.	2003-05-11

Beginning in dusty Stamps, Arkansas and eventually ending in glamourous San Francisco (while visiting exciting St. Louis and imposing Mexico in between) Angelou pivots her childhood chronicle around youth's joy and tribulations.  Alternating between comedy and tragedy, Angelou's work reads like a treasured bedtime story on a chilly evening, blanket and cocoa included.  Words are expertly manipulated in order to produce fascinating accounts of otherwise plebeian events.  However, the book's Achilles heel likes in these very events; only so many beautifully unique ways exist to explain daily life, and much to the language's avail, the book suffers for it.  Still, in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou produced a vivid portrait of life in the slow deep South in the 1930s.	2003-04-01

The Crucible by Arthur Miller is not really a book, but I've decided to count it anyway.  The play is short, and I finished it in one afternoon because I was so engrossed.  Also, I enjoyed it much more than I did The Death of a Salesman, also written by Miller.  One of my favorite aspects of the play was its relevance to modern times; at points, I couldn't tell whether the action was set in Salem in the 1600s or Washington DC in the 1950s.  In addition, the first act included one of my favorite lines I've read recently: \\"Their fathers had, of course, been persecuted in England.  So now they found it necessary to deny any other sect its freedom, lest their New Journalism be defiled and corrupted by wrong ways and deceitful ideas.\\"	2003-02-06

Frank Baum's OZ books, including the short story compilation.  <br />After glancing at Glinda's Magic Record book, Dorothy notices war has been declared in a remote corner of OZ no one has ever visited.  Being the good, just, and noble queen she is, Ozma decides to travel there with Dorothy and the wooden sawhorse in order to implore her people to solve their differences without violence.  The journey there is practically uneventful (Ozma and Dorothy adroitly find themselves out of only one misstep), but once they visit Evil Queen Coo-eh-oh they find themselves imprisoned under a globe.  Glinda, alerted of their peril by an enchanted ring she gave to Dorothy, sets out immediately with all of OZ's favorite characters in order to rescue the two girls and make peace between the Flatheads and the Skeezers.<br />Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this story as much as I did the others; perhaps that is because I've grown up and lost my ability to see the playful fun in Baum's books-although I certainly hope not!	2003-02-06

I enjoyed the portrayal of Grendel's mother because Gardner showed her as desolate and nearly dependent on her son.  This was an interesting departure from the despair-ridden, revenge-seeking character in Beowulf.<br />The book's climax comes in the last ten pages when Beowulf appears, and ironically enough, I read these pages as an excerpt last year.  However, having read Beowulf, the ending was already \\"spoiled,\\" so to speak.  (Still, it seems good triumphs over evil more often in early literature than during another time period.)<br />Overall, if one reads Beowulf, I recommend they also read Grendel.  Without Beowulf, however, this book would be confusing and difficult to follow.	2003-02-06

In Girl with a Pearl Earring, Tracy Chevalier puts forth the possible story behind one of the more famous paintings.<br />Griet is a teenager when the failure of her father's eyesight causes him to abandon his tile-making trade.  The family's financial instability forces her into work for a wealthy Catholic family and her brother into another artisan profession.  Griet's new life with her \\"new family\\"-that of Vermer-is certainly different, in terms of religion, daily routine, social status, and financial status.  After a few months, she adjusts to her new life and finds herself separating from her family.<br />Chevalier's descriptions of the Netherlands and of painting in the seventeenth-century helped the book because they provided a framework for everything else.  Although I loved Griet, she seems too strong and too modern for the novel's time period; could a sixteen-year-old maid, with no formal education of any kind, really have outsmarted Vermeer?  Her observations about her master's art seemed too astute and too quick, even if she was supposed to be a fast learner.  Overall, I would recommend Girl with a Pearl Earring to anyone looking for a quick, engaging, and light novel.	2003-02-06

There, he observes the corruptibility of man's nature, heart, and mind.  This portrayal did not shock me as I would have expected, but that is most likely because I knew the story and imperialism's effects.<br />Extremely long paragraphs and a continuous retrospective made this book difficult to read for long periods of time.  However, having gotten through it, I can confidently say that it was worth the time spent.	2003-02-06

Wiesel wrote this book about fifteen years after the event in order to distance himself from it somewhat (obviously, the experience left too much of an impact to ever be forgotten.)<br />Through his direct prose and straight language, Wiesel informs the reader of the horrors of the Holocaust.  SS guards, barracks, showers, transportation, death marches, rations ... nothing escapes without Wiesel's observations.  However, the book lacked description, perhaps because the experience was still too painful for Wiesel to recall-or perhaps because words do not exist to describe the trial.<br />If only one book is read about the people behind the Holocaust, it should be Anne Frank's Diary.  However, if one book is read about the Holocaust itself, Eli Wiesel's Night is compelling, shocking, and enlightening.	2003-02-06

This story of small town life in Ohio at the turn of the century has been heralded for presenting accurate portraits of real, authentic people while highlighting their flaws and shortcomings.  A few of these portraits are still accurate today.<br />I liked the circular design of the book; by this, I mean I enjoyed how the book began, ended, and centered around one character, George Williard.  Although sometimes I think this can make a novel seem too perfect (or at least too planned and calculated), it was certainly an asset here.<br />My favorite story was \\"Godliness, a tale in four parts.\\"  Perhaps this is because of my cynical side, but Anderson's hilarious portrayal of religious fervor kept my attention, more so than any other story.<br />Despite these points, I really didn't enjoy this book; it seemed to continue on, and the characters were not engaging enough to mitigate this.	2003-02-02

He is, however, painfully aware that he's a Russian immigrant, a naturalized American citizen, and a Jew.  These three qualities give Girshkin a painful inferiority complex, one which alternates between hilarious and disheartening. <br />Instead, Girshkin does know he needs more money than he could ever earn acclimating Russian citizens to America in order to support his new, nouveau riche lifestyle in New York City, flittering among TriBeCa's inner circles and cliques.  So, he travels to Prava-the glittering and grimy capital of Eastern Europe in the early `90s-to cavort with the Russian mafiaso and pull off the pyramid scheme to end all pyramid schemes.  There, he works under the shadow of communism, literally; an immense statue of Stalin's foot occupies much of Prava's main square, serving as a grim reminder of the Soviet way of life and, more specifically, 1969.<br />Once in Prava, Girshkin quickly establishes himself as the Hemmingway of the 30,000-plus strong expatriate community, where everyone is a Fitzgerald and parties like they'll never return home.  <br />This novel is infused with Gary Shteyngart's perception of Americans and their culture and his reflections on what it is like to be without a country.  Through Shteyngart's witty phrases and dialogue, he proves he knows his adopted country better than most native-born Americans; phrases like \\"And Vladimir, young and tiny but already a child of America, said, `Aren't there pills she can take?'\\" make the reader cringe with a chagrined acceptance.	2003-01-27

Unfortunatly, that book has proved extremly difficult to procure; my local library's copy is perpetually checked out.  Being the impatient teenager I am, I settled for \\"The Unicorn Sonata,\\" also by Beagle.<br />The book was a quick read (it took me less than a day), ranking in at 154 pages.  Regardless, I enjoyed the story and felt my time was well-spent.  This novel is definetely best classifed as a Young Adult story, and was certainly more elementary than what I usually read-not that this is a bad thing; it's just different. <br />Joey, a pre-teen from Los Angelos, unassumingly works at Papa's Music shop until a strange boy visits the store, hoping to sell an equally strange blue horn.  After hearing the instrument, Joey is enraptured; she cannot get the music from her head, and when she begins to hear it at night, she leaves her bed to follow the melodious sounds.  Her short quest brings her to Shel'rah, a mythical land populated by unicorns, pheonixs, and water-jalla.  There, she meets Shel'rah's inhabitants and learns of their problem-one which only she can solve.<br />I'd recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys the fantasy novels and is in search of a quick, mindless afternoon read.	2003-01-25

Torn between moving forward or watching over her family and friends, Suzie rests in her personal heaven-the high school she never got to attend, where her \\"textbooks were Seventeen and Glamour and Vogue.\\"<br />While in heaven, Suzie \\"lives\\" vicariously through her younger sister, watches her parent's relationship crumble, guards over her childhood crush (\\"Our only kiss was like an accident-a beautiful gasoline rainbow\\"), peers into the life of the all-too human detective assigned to her case, and stalks her murderer.<br />This coming-of-age history is bittersweet until the very end, tracing the lives of those Suzie touched while examining death's effects. Unfortunately, Sebold muddies a strong first novel and leaves the reader with a too-tidy ending, mimicking her protagonist's heaven.	2003-01-25

Being an OZ fan (I believe I've read thirteen of the fourteen OZ books written by Baum), the moment I saw Gregory Maguire's \\"Wicked\\" at a  bookstore I knew I had to purchase it.  Wicked's premise is this: what if the Wicked Witch of the West wasn't really so wicked and OZ wasn't as idyllic as it seemed?  And what if the Wizard of OZ, in addition to being a fraud, was also a tyrant?  Just what would happen to someone who joined a resistance movement against the Wizard?  I found this novel interesting, although the first fifty pages contained what I considered gratuitous sexual content; stories of Elphaba's mother's sexual trysts with strangers didn't bring anything to the book, in my opinion, nor did portraying Munchkinlanders as sex-crazed heathens.<br />Still, this book comes highly recommended from a self-confessed OZ and fantasy fan.	2003-01-25

(For example, I think I read the same passage three times at three different points because the book is not related chronologically.  The changes in time themselves are confusing, but Butcher's repeted and overzealous attacks on Steve Jobs, his company and his character only exacerbate the problem.)  Additionally, I feel compelled to beleive Jobs brought something to the company; after all, how did he stay around for so long, and why was he invited back?  Sure, an immense amount of luck does seem to have gone along with him, but he had to have had some kind of marketable skill  beyond deciding packaging.<br />Overall, I'd recommend Accidental Millionaire to only the most steadfast Apple fans.	2003-01-25

I recommend this French play, in which two characters spend two acts waiting for the mysterious Godot, to everyone because of its message about religion.  At first glance, that message seems to be one advocating the opinion that religion is futile, but on closer examination, the play sends out a different message to readers.

Still today, over two hundred years after it was written, Candide still shines as one of literature's best satires.  <br />The book is full of pessimism does not prevent him from using humor throughout the book.  Some of the humor used in the book is blatant; the governor of Buenos Ayres declares his love for Cunégonde, says he will marry her, then never does.  In case readers did not understand the hypocrisy, Voltaire gave the governor a name to remember: Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figuerora y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza.  Another interesting name is that of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh.  The illeteration and mental imagery is what stood out for me; the name brings pictures of a corpulent man thundering down a hall.  It does not sound aristocratic (if indeed, names can be aristocratic) and seems more of a misnomer than a label for a noble from Wittenburg.  By examining the Baron's behavior (working everyone towards his goals and then profiting from their labor while he does nothing) the name is no longer a misnomer.<br />Candide reminded me of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote in that a man following the regulations of chivalry is driven to do the correct thing even though disastrous consequences may come of it.  Candine discovers this when he rescues Cunégonde from a Turkish noble and finds she is ugly and disagreeable.  In addition, Don Quixote and Candide both find themselves in improbable situations over and over again.  Both books are satire and they poke fun at the same government, social, and ecclesiastical principles.  Despite the similarity, I did enjoy reading Candide more so than I did Don Quixote.	2002-12-15

Quixote was originally known as Alonso Quixano, La Manchan noble, who was content with reading stories of knighthood and chivalry and tending to his estate.  Eventually, after reading these books, he decided it is his responsibility to set out with someone else in his village (Sancho Panza, his squire) to right the wrongs of people across Spain.  Sancho Panza seems to be a very grounded person, but he admires Don Quixote so much his good sense disappears.  In the beginning, Panza agreed to leave his family and travel with Quixote only because he promised Panza he would become the governor of the first island they came to; when this doesn't happen, Panza doesn't leave because he loves to company of the eccentric Quixote.<br />All the adventures Don Quixote goes on are in the name of his love Dulcinia, and although she never makes an appearance in the book she seems to embody chivalric ideals.  Unfortunately for our protagonists, Don Quixote often has confusion with the real and imaginary, mistaking inns for castles, grazing sheep for conflicting armies, windmills for enemy enchanters and traveling monks for wizards transporting a princess against her will.  All mistakes are blamed on a powerful necromancer, who is Don Quixote's mortal enemy (since all knights have them.) Although Quixote is mocked by many, in the end they mimic his restlessness and discomfort for what is considered \\"normal\\" in society.<br />Overall, I'm glad I read Don Quixote even though it was longer then I bargained for.  The book helped me get a better picture of what life was like in Spain during the Renaissance period.  I learned simple things like there actually were windmills in other parts of Europe besides the Netherlands and more complex things like exactly what chivalry and its ideals consist of.	2002-12-15

Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is considered to be a magnificent work of modern literature and a supreme observation of social structure and class conflict.  The book follows two main characters (Kostya Levin and Anna Karenin,) detailing their experiences in late nineteenth century Russian society.  Although the two rarely share the page, Tolstoy subtly compares and contrasts them.  Anna is the socialite who seems to have everything; she is idolized by young girls and is viewed as the picture of happiness.  If only they had everything Anna had, then they would be happy, these girls thought.  Levin is a simple man (or at least simple in comparison with the rest of the characters) who enjoys agriculture and experimenting with his large plots of land.  Both Anna and Levin try to find happiness and reach a stage of self-fulfillment throughout the book; Anna attempts to do this through romance, while Levin chooses a family life and hard work.  Perhaps the greatest lesson in Tolstoy's book is that society is not always correct; the person they think the happiest can be the most depressed while the simplest person can also be the most contented.<br />As a Russian author, Tolstoy obviously held a Russian perspective and took the Russian side in matters like the Crimean war and the Slav question.  Although politics were only briefly touched upon, a bias was evident.<br />Overall, I liked Anna Karenina and I will likely read it again someday for pleasure.  The book was long (my copy was over eight hundred pages) but once I \\"got in\\" to the book, the pages flew by and before I knew it I had read seventy pages in one sitting.  The only thing I did not like about the book were the bits of French placed in normal conversation.  As I am a level three French student, I understood most of what Tolstoy wrote.  However, the phrases seemed to be put in randomly and without any clear purpose or reasoning.  I do understand that Tolstoy used French because the Russian aristocracy did; he wanted to stay true to actual life.  (During the late nineteenth century, when Tolstoy wrote this book, fluency in the French language was considered to be a status symbol; if one was fluent, chances were one also belonged to the aristocracy.)  Despite this minor flaw, I would recommend this book to anyone who asked.ed to stay true to actual life.

The retelling of the famous rags-to-riches story of Cinderella is known world wide, but Levine's retelling gives this age-old tale new life and endures it to an entirely new generation.	2001-06-11

Although the length may be intimidating to some, the pages fly by as one learns more and more about six different women who each met different ends.  Without having read this book, no one can consider themselves a Tudor history buff.	2001-06-11

He invested that time well, as the final product shows. This alone saves this book from a lower rating because of the slowness and overwhelming facts.	2001-06-11
