This 'work', merely an arranged compendium of useless episodes and scenes, is completey boring and without any enrichment, all it does is tire the reader.  The style is marginally academic, that is to say, it is written in long, flaccid sentences with too much self-exaltation included.  I was bored by the entire book, Breton imagines that it was revolutionary to write about fractured and obtuse occurrences which have nothing to do with anything except his own idea of importance.  He meanders through pretentious descriptions which are trite.  Don't be fooled by his sycophantic adherents who believe that he actually \\"invented\\" surrealism and art.  I'd rather read the true ramblings of a madman than this ordure.	2005-01-21

It starts off as a vapid pseudo-bio but the author never real gives us any authentic substance in the 300+ pages. He throws out names as if we are supposed to know defunct abstractions and pretentious writers and he skips the years 1932-1945 for some reason. About half way through the read he really let me down because he goes on to say one of the most incongruous and nonsensical things I have ever heard of, that Franco of Spain \\"was not really a fascist\\". Obviously the guy has no understanding of precepts relating to Spain or Europe and the ending is a complete waste, considering he devoted one page to Bunuel's death.	2004-12-03

Seems that he has become the 'real' expert now, considering he's made about 30 or so cheap pulp novels that are degrading to basic intelligence and writer's craftsmanship and yet best sellers. This boringly conversational book about literary craftsmanship should produce sleep in all those who find something oxymoronic in its conception. He may not be the most noble of stylists, and neither does he know how to make a story fly.<br /><br />In the arena of storytelling he argues for interesting situations rather than grouped plotting. ''Plot is, I think, the good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice.'' Is he for real? He doesn't even attempt to be understood.<br /><br />'On Writing'' began as a compendium of tips and whines in a tone suitable for a lecture circuit or Internet discussion, nothing more. It also included a sharp, pungent account of Mr. King's growing up (being fat and getting beat up), finding a soul mate named Tabitha (whom he secretly thinks a witch), going through a rocky phase that involved taking drugs and drinking mouthwash (suicide attempts), and eventually discovering his professional destiny (to produce minor works). This makes for the most bizarre read ever, its so surreal that you won't believe you are reading a King biography. Then, through an outrageous twist of fate, it became something more, an attempt to be a best seller. Of course people will pick this up expecting a candid tale of his life, what they will get is a Monstrous accident described here in the most ironclad plotting.	2004-12-03

It's rather tame by today's standards, and very outdated and silly, not to mention dull. Most of the writing style is flat, drawn out prose, an imitation of Jack Keroauc and 1940's film noir crime novels, which the author translated. I find most of the scenes incredulous and there's a lot of \\"sex\\" going on, which doesn't seem very plausible in the novel. It deals with a black man who actually looks white who goes on to plot some type of revenge against \\"whitey\\".	2004-12-03

When you examine their claims however, they are fueled by their own myopic views, fascist intentions and warped sense of reality.<br /><br />This book, written by an amateurish hack who calls herself a \\"journalist\\", was in some way written to \\"legitimize\\" the absurd notion of \\"internment\\" and racial profiling during World War 2 and subsequent years to come. It's basic tenet is that since America was at war with Japan, \\"every Japanese person is an enemy\\".<br /><br />Lacking all modes of common sense, not to mention contradicting itself, it is a thesis formed by either a dead gerbil or an immature high school student. Using her argument, its then asked why didn't everyone in America get locked up? Heck, everyone fits some ethnic pattern that was involved in the war. One can't suppose because a man is Japanese that is is obviously an enemy, not only does that violate basic individualistic and philosophical premises, it violates the American constitution. I know hundreds of instances where American soliders were saved by \\"Jap civilians and soliders\\". Merit belongs to individuals not to political ideology or \\"profiling\\". There was no evidence at all for what the governtment did at that time except to reinforce propaganda for a war which was just a war between super powers of the world.	2004-12-03

''War and Peace'' seems to allow Natasha everything, to be one long celebration of her vitality and its triumph; but, no, it doesn't give her any life of her own. She must grow from lively girl to vigorous matron at the author's behest and not disturb his conception of what a good woman should be. Tolstoy was a mind numbing dullard, a massive misogynist who gave his best attempt at writing a novel about European history, the end of the 'aristocratic age' in the 19th century, he made it into one of the most boring stories ever conceived and on top of that it became one of the most over-rated. The early chapters are passive and inert, sometimes pathetic, even dull. The influence of V.G. Chertkov on Tolstoy can probably be explained by the fact that they belonged originally to the same world - the army and society, parties, wenching and card playing. Probably even more than Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy has been praised as being the greatest novelist in world literature which is a complete and utter defacement to forgotten Russian writers from which he plagerized his work such as Mikhail Saltykov, Mikhail Zoshchenko and Ivan Goncharov. Thus there was nothing wholly original in Tolstoy, he was outdated by the time he had reached the age of 30...I suggest reading Dostoyevsky instead, he is a fresh approach to the character of Russia.	2004-12-03

She writes about that deluded idea in this book, rarely mentioning any sense of truthful reporting, that the \\"terrorists\\" actually flew in quite easily and that America was not let down because of the \\"easy access border\\" but because of the ineptness and stupidity of the FBI and CIA, which by the way have spent billions on intelligence (including spying on peaceful groups and dissenters) and yet could not figure that a plane could be used as a weapon (hint: open up a WW2 Kamikaze book).  Also to note is that most of these \\"terrorists\\" were trained by the CIA at one point, to undermine \\"democratically elected\\" governments which were opposed to U.S. imperialism.  Anyways, its obvious that Bush had the towers demolished so that he could have a \\"clean slate\\" when it comes to international retribution, as is the case now in the middle east.  His money hungry, oil loving friends did't seem to mind that 3000 people were killed for a cheap victory.  Just invent a \\"terrorist\\" cell to take the blame, most Americans will believe it without even seeing one bit of proof.<br /><br />Most of the border crossings are from people who seek a better life from work across the border and there are a few petty criminals, as the case in any human civilization, but no terrorists would be stupid enough to cross and face possible capture.  The corporations do not want the illegals to be \\"legalized\\" because then they would gain rights and unionize and threaten the market of exploitation found in Los Angeles and other cities with notable agricultural areas.  The \\"terrorists\\", whoever they are supposed to be, infiltrate the country through normal means, any former soldier would know that, they try to blend in and not arouse suspicion.<br /><br />The purpose of this \\"paranoia of fear\\" is simply to indoctrinate Americans into a pattern of resentment against 'other' groups, namely those who speak different languages and are not white.  This works great on the \\"billon dollar\\" industry spent on the Border patrol (which has done nothing to deter drug imports, which of course are controlled by Washington anyways).

He was drunk most of the time he had put pen to paper and he threw so much of the text out that its suprising that most people hold this pretentious amateurish work as the greatest novel of the last one hundred years. The prose is vague, uninspiring and chatoic, there is no plot line what-so-ever, it's just a meandering stream of undelicate and unsophisticated garble from a minor artist.	2001-02-07
