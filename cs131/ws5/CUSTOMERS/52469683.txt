Since reading Vinge, Bear, and Gibson, I have been very interested in the idea of uploading a personality and space exploration using uploaded avatars. Stross does a great job of exploring those notions. Even better was his conceptualization of post-human intelligences as limited liability corporations. This was a subtle but compelling idea in the story...that our corporations would take over is a new idea... <br /> <br />The book is a lot of fun with interesting ideas, and I highly recommend it it you like \\"cyberpunk\\" types of science fiction. The ending didn't do much for me, but the middle was worth the trip.	2005-08-08

It is also a great introduction to social construction, and the idea meaning (including the meaning of our selves) is a socially created truth rather than an absolute. Unlike a lot of books by academics, Gergen has crafeted a very readable book, that I not only learned from but enjoyed immensly.	2005-06-22

As most classics are, this is not the most up-to-date book on reflection and action, and if you are looking for something that will give you a fast pay-off, I suggest looking elsewhere. If, however, you are interested in reading one of the foundational pieces of writing on these issues, this is one of the classics, and an important book.	2005-06-13

One that I can't give it more than 5 stars, and that I did not read it a long time ago. I read this book to learn more about Hock's views on complexity and organization, what he describes as a \\"chaordic system.\\" While I met that purpose, I also discovered much more. <br /> <br />The personal narrative about failure and disappointment before Hock's leadership in the creation of VISA is something I needed to read years ago before I went through frustrating set-backs in my own career for related reasons. <br /> <br />What's more, Hock's understanding and recommendations for harnessing the power of complex systems is brilliant. If you could read only one book on leadership and complexity, I would strongly encourage this book to be it. <br /> <br />Part of what I find so amazing is that Hock is able to express a great deal of cutting edge philosophy and social science thinking  as he tells a business story. <br /> <br />Read this book and share the ideas within with others!	2005-02-21

Most change programs (personal or professional, organizational or individual) fail because they don’t address the mental models that people use to comprehend and act in the world. Wind, Crook, and Gunther explain how not only to understand how mental models work but also how to change them.  The writing is very direct and easy to read with excellent examples and insights.  The ideas are based on solid research and science yet practical and usable.

Connective leaders are able to select and apply from several achievement strategies depending on the needs of a particular situation.  This flexibility gives them the ability to bridge these two conflict forces. <br /> <br />The book is conceptual very strong...the ideas are insightful and well researched, using a variety of data sources.  The two main limitations are that the book is not well connected to other related patterns of thinking in the literature and that it is not the strongest in the direction of how to be a connective leader.  In fact, much of the text is really a restatement about how different leaders exemplify a particular strategy rather than how a leader selects and uses a mixture of these situationally. I understand why these limitations exist, but I can certainly not suggest that this is the only book on leadership you should read. <br /> <br />One other comment...the book has a very strong feminist slant, proposing a shift from traditional patriarchical values to a more inclusive world view.  I think, on the whole, that is a very good thing.  However, the author's understanding of Machiavelli takes his writing and thinking out of context.  This is only a minor quibble, but I find it interesting how the author can be so dismissive in her effort to claim a new vision of leadership.	2004-08-04

The techniques are concrete, simple, and powerful.  This is not a theory book but truly a handbook of techniques that will not only improve your teaching but more importantly improve your students' learning.	2004-08-03

It is an excellent book for both faculty and administrators in higher education.	2004-08-03

I am not a big fan of business books using the fable/parable approach to begin with, but this was unreadable.  The concept of self-deception is a powerful one, but for me, this book is not a tool that I find of value.  However, if you really, really like business fables, you might enjoy this as much as some of the other reviewers.	2004-07-29
