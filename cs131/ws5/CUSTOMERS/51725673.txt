This book was reccommended to me because I like &quot;The House of the Seven Gables;&quot; I read it after I enjoyed an Edith Horton book (I had heard they were contemporaries with similar styles.)  The book is very well written and I enjoyed his use of vocab words; it wasn't written for an 8th grade education.  (The vocab is a plus, but I had to use the dictionary in several places- a plus for me could be an annoyance to you.)  The ending leaves you wondering what happened next; who really saw the ghosts; if there's mental illness, who has it... I enjoyed it because of the ending and because it is a ghost story that doesn't contain thumps in the attic and &quot;boo&quot; (or bloody violence.)  My one critism is that some sentences were so long that I had to reread them several times to grasp their meaning-frustrating.  Overall, a very good book that should pique your interest.	2002-03-11

I especially liked her humor when she wrote that society thought having a ballroom in your home dedicated to only dances was wasteful, but it was very good if it could also be used for something else.  The book really invites you into pre-WWI, pre-Titanic society.  Whorton also points out some valuable lessons such as how good liars explain things but really great liars explain nothing. (More or less)  Her vocabulary is also a plus; I needed a dictionary about twice in every chapter, but it was very fulfilling.  My favorite &quot;new&quot; word is &quot;confabulation.&quot;  From now on, when my grandmother makes up sunny personal history, I shall compliment her unrivaled ability to confabulate.  :)  Very worth the time it takes to read.	2002-02-13

I just grew weary of the main character's (Caroline's) self-indulgent mental pontifications.  There were times Caroline just went on for pages  exploring Caroline's thoughts about being a good mother, being a good daughter, her husband and divorce, her education and career goals, I mean, it was just too much.  It was very funny though... yes, it has many Southern cliches, but cliches start somewhere.  I just wondered when Ms. Benthon Frank came to supper at my house  to get ideas for the white trash sister-in-law, that was one hilarious dinner around chapter 10.  One thing I would mention is that if you are having trouble with PTSD in light of Sept 11th, save this book for later.  There is  one horrifying chapter involving a plane crash, explosion, burning body, and ashes and body parts everywhere.  I might be ultra sensitive because a FDNY captain is very important to me, but it was a very hard chapter to read and set off some PTSD episodes for me.  Still an enjoyable book... I actually cried toward the end, I've only cried over a book like that one other time.  Worth reading	2001-12-18

Without giving away the ending, you might as well just go rent \\"Dead Man Walking\\" because it's along the same lines.  It's about a man who tries to start a farming \\"complex\\" with his family and the trials they endure such as death, birth, drought, etc.  There's also this part about religion and a tree, sounds strange... since this was his second novel, I feel like he went back and developed it into two novels- East of Eden about the religion and God and thou maysest/I brought rain and Grapes of Wrath about drought, plight of farmers, desolation, the land turning bad, etc.  I also didn't care for his misogyny.  I've found it in many of his works, but this has the most overt example: \\"I thought he'd pick a wife as he'd pick a cow- to be a good cow, perfect in the activity of cows- to be a good wife and very like a cow\\" (67).  Overall, I'd reccommend reading Grapes of Wrath and/or East of Eden (but with EoE, watch out for the misogyny through the character of evil Cathy the (...) mother/poor wife)	2001-12-03

It's set in the Rocky Mountains, like the other three, and the descriptions of the scenery are great.  You really get a feeling that the characters are there; it's not like a cheesy romance novel that could take place anywhere.  The characters are richly described and have many aspects; it's not like they are just two cardboard people who come together by some unbreakable bond and live happily ever after.  Lowell always has tiny women and huge men, but in this novel, he's actually nice.  In the second &quot;Only&quot; book, the big guy was abusive and I hated the novel.  This is definately a fun read and worth the time.	2001-12-03

There's humor, hope, sadness, anger,... just all the emotions.  Because the chapters switch from present to past, you find yourself always wanting to read more to find out what happens in the past (or present).  I found myself really identifying with the main character (Susan), but also with several other characters; they are all written very well and multideminsional.  There's a lot of Southern humor in the book too what with all the &quot;big&quot; dishes to bring a family after a funeral, it being indecent for men to wear sandles [hairy toes, hee hee], and the constant references to iced tea.  Wish it was co-cola and note coca cola, but hey, can't have everything.  I also with that in the bit of history about the actual island, there was information about it being the &quot;ellis island&quot; of African Americans as it was the main place of slave importation in colonial America.  Loved the stuff about Gulluh people and the actual bits of that language.  Think I'll keep this book to reread someday if I ever forget it enough for it to be a &quot;surprise&quot; again.	2001-11-16

I had to put the book away when a cia team of anthropologists entered the plot.  Give me a break, people with PhDs being foreign spies.  That's so laughable.  Yes, I can just see my Yale-educated dowdy professor dashing off to Pakistan, Chad, or Peru to infultrate and destroy.  Rolling on the floor here.

I rated it against his other novels, not just in general.  Four stars because Grapes of Wrath, Cannery Row, etc are 5 stars... This is his only historical novel (I believe).  It's an easy read and forshadows his common themes like disalutionment (sp?) or like the U2 song &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.&quot;  It reminded me a lot of his later novel, East of Eden, and the whole &quot;thou mayest&quot; theme.  It's not a pirate/adventure story.  Yes, Henry Morgan was a pirate, but if you're looking for &quot;ahoy matey, walk the plank,&quot; try &quot;Treasure Island&quot; or even &quot;Peter Pan.&quot;  This book was very enjoyable to read.	2001-11-07

The author obviously did a lot of research and captures the time period's innocence.  The fist part of the book mostly sets the scene of how niave people were about sharks and &quot;evil things&quot; in general.  The rest of the novel describes the rouge shark attacks in very graphic details.  Parts that I found especially good were about one person feeling hunted but not knowing why and a boy being scraped by the shark's sandpaper skin.  Those details are terrifying.  Yea, there's gore, but the unknown is much scarier.  This book is very good, you can also see where Benchley got many ideas for Jaws.	2001-09-25

I'm an archaeologist and this isn't archaeology.  Cracked me up!  I'm also very intersted in Civil War history and the idea that a Civil War submarine crossed the Atlantic and ended up in Africa is positively ludicris.  The only thing funnier is who was on the sub (I won't give it away and spoil your good laugh).  And then Clive Cussler shows up in the middle of the African desert.  The author also explains why Mary Todd Lincoln was crazy, funny, I thought it was because she was bipolar and lost her son and husband.	2001-09-24

It's all okay because after verbally humiliating her in front of people, he says sorry.  Please, spare me.

I hadn't read this book since 10th grade, so I bought a new copy and read it again.  I like the imagery and characterizations.  It's a good story, plus it is a good book to read when you want to read \\"literature\\" but are intimidated by the 800-page Russian or British books. (Or likewise, Grapes of Wrath)  The major problem I have with this book and much of Steinbeck's works are that the majority of women are portrayed as [prostitutes] who let their sexuality cause evil.  Even on the back of this novel, it says something like \\"George protected innocent Lenny until a flirtacious woman...\\"  I'm just tired of Steinbeck's view of women as evil sexual temptresses (East of Eden, Wayward Bus) or [prostitutes] (Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday)... definately worth reading though.	2001-09-02

I really like how it's written in first person, so what you read are Miss Julia's thoughts. I also enjoyed the names, especially Pastor Leadbetter- gee, what does that name say about his abilities as a pastor/leader. This book just cracked me up. I also enjoyed how most people were concerned about Miss Julia's Christian morals and in the end, she and the other &quot;fallen women&quot; were the only people displaying Christain mores, putting two simon-pure pastors to shame. You simply must read this book. I'm giving this book to 5 women on my Christmas list this year.	2001-08-30

Oh lord, I got my first huge chuckle from mammoths freezing solid where they stood (in preface or intro) and continued laughing from there.  Not sure what is funnier: Atlantians colonized Antartica, the Forth Richt (as in Nazi's were the Third Richt, not sure how to spell 'richt&quot;), the so-called archaeologist acting like a hired killer/adventurer, or the author writing himself into the novel-on Antarctica of all places.

The part about Clara Bow is especially mean-spirited and cruel.  It is a rather well known fact that the story about Clara Bow &quot;entertaining&quot; the USC football team isn't true, yet, here the story is in print.  I also found it uncalled for to show a photo of Judy Garland at about age 15 and then show &quot;old Judy&quot; and describe her as a pill popping queen... it's well known she took pills because of the studio and was given them as &quot;medication.&quot;  These are screen ledgends being trashed by some yellow journalist who writes at the quality level of The National Enquirer.  Also, I don't care to read about supposed sexual escapades of male stars as great conquests and rumors about the sexuality of female stars as actions of a cheap, street corner hooker.  This rag essentially says that Errol Flynn could have banged (yes, slang) anyone he wanted to, but Lillian Gish has a incestous lesbian relationship with her sister.

Because of the glowing reviews, I was excited to read &quot;Rachel's Choice.&quot;  The plot is very good with some interesting twists.  However, I'm tired of reading romance novels where the man sweeps in and saves the day for the woman.  I'm also tired of reading &quot;sex scenes&quot; that are along the lines of &quot;he took her again and again.&quot;  Be real.  Plus the historical aspect isn't very realistic.  I get tired of all Southerners in romance books not believing in slavery/not owning slaves, lets be real, if this Chance fellow (crative name) was a calvary officer, then he had to provide his own horse, meaning he owned property and, undoubtedly, slaves.  This book has good imagry and discriptions of rural life, but it's not much of a historical romance novel, unless romance has suddenly come to mean sex that involves throbing hardness on the riverbank.  Also, I found it to be slightly homophobic in one part.	2001-06-09

It is a story about Swedish, German, etc, immigrants who work the land and farm, but I was quite taken by her imagery and insites.

It's the first of the Donovan series (Jade Island, Pearl Cove, Midnight in Ruby Bayou)  I only wish there were more books in this series, each book focuses on a particular Donovan sibling and it seems to me that there's still two that don't have books (the twin boys, Justin and Lawe?) Anyway, what I really liked about this book was that the woman, Honor, is a fully developed character and somewhat of a feminist type.  She's not just primping around trying to find a husband but looking for her brother and giving lessons how it shouldn't be &quot;fisherman&quot; when referring to a woman but &quot;fishersan.&quot;  Also, the information about Amber is really interesting and a bonus.

In the acknowledgements, the author thanks JF Cooper and S Clemens.  That's just pretentious to thank two famous American authors (James Fenimore Cooper and Mark Twain).  She also borrows characters from Cooper.  Although this is an ambitious attempt to write a sequal to Cooper's &quot;Last of the Mohicans,&quot; it isn't a very good attempt.  While the historical facts, Mohican language etc, is correct, I just don't care to read about a &quot;uncomfortable tightening in Hawkeye's breaches.&quot;  If you're interested in a sequal to Cooper's books, try the rest of the Leatherstocking series, if you're looking for a epic romance novel involving Native Americans, try &quot;She Who Hears the Sun&quot; by Pamala Jekel.	2001-05-08

Very deep mystery about a dying witch's curse.  It's not a fast-moving thriller, by a slow and methodical one.  Every word is chosen so carefully by Hawthorne, that it is fun to read and a challenge for the mind to find the hidden meaning.  The novel starts with a discription of the house- the house with human attributes and ends with a lone cat watching the fulfillment of a witch's curse.  Really excellent.

It's long, but I was so interested that I read it in about a week (while I took college courses as well).  The main character, Mary, is a true heroine, she's not this silly love-starved, look-for-a-husband-type that's usually found in historical romance/fiction novels.  You know it was a good book when a month later you think to yourself &quot;now, who was it that...&quot; and you realize it was a character from a book.  Discriptions of N'arlings are great, too.  Compleate with banquettes, coffee, and banyaes (sp?).  Now I can understand why Ripley was chosen to write the sequal to &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot;  If you like epic type historical romances, you'll like this book!	2001-05-04

Well, it wasn't his best.  It is a very long book and I think there were less insights in the 600+ pages than in the 90 pages of &quot;The Pearl.&quot;  The major insight can be summed up as &quot;timshel&quot; meaning thou mayest.  Mostly, the novel is about the Trask family... two brother, hmm, Caleb and Arron (?) anyway, Cain and Able.  It's also a history of sorts of the Steinbeck family.  One part I didn't like was the extreme sexism.  Both in lack of female characters but also in the main female character (Kathy) being a cold-blooded...  Sure, some women are mean..., but there are sweeping generalities about all women being teases, cold, etc etc.  The parts about the Chinese man (Lee) are very good.  Overall, I like other Steinbecks better... try Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men, The Wayward Bus, or Cannery Row.  Just my opinion.	2001-05-04

On one level, it is a burning love story about obsession, yearning, and unrequited love, but on another level, this book is an interesting look at life in the Roaring Twenties.  I love the vivid character discriptions, symbolism, and vocabulary.  Come on, the green light at the end of Daisy's dock... Doctor JT Eckelberg's eyes looking down about man... supercilious and vaccuous... ha... it's a classic.  Love it and reread it every few years.  Also, this edition has notes in the back that explain some names and history (such as Gatz being slang for gun, etc.)  very helpful	2001-05-04
US	51725673	R2TGTZDMBFKFSK	014017737X	779170984	The Pearl	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Not Steinbeck's best	I'm a huge fan of Steinbeck and couldn't believe I hadn't read &quot;The Pearl&quot; in high school.  So, I bought it at Amazon and wasn't impressed with the book.  While some of the author's  observations about people, human nature, and towns/communities are really good, this book is somewhat blah.  It's based on a Mexican folk tale, so I can't fault Steinbeck for the lack of plot, but something just seems to be missing.  I also didn't like the end, it was somewhat gory and made me think &quot;ewww&quot; just like the scenes in the &quot;Red Pony&quot; with the flies buzzing around the pony.  There are just times the Steinbeck is gross, I can think of an example from each of his books.  You can also get Steinbeck's discriptions of towns as a functional unit in &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; which is, by far, a better book.	2001-05-03

It doesn't come across as preachy or fake at all; it shows actual pages from Rachel's diaries and her deep spirituality and love come across in a very real way.  Rachel's thoughts and feelings were quite profound, but she expressed them in a very raw and honest manner.  I believe that the photo on the cover speaks for itself: while Rachel's inner light is clearly visable, she's wearing jeans and a t-shirt- she's &quot;just&quot; an average teen who had some very &quot;unaverage&quot; thoughts.  The raw emotion expressed by her parents, siblings, and friends is painful to read and yet shows how special Rachel was and continues to be.  Rachel was one together young lady and her words are definately worth reading and internalizing.	2001-04-09

Many of the characters are the same and it's fun to read about them again.  I love the descriptions of Monterrey CA (sp?) and enjoy reading about Doc's work as a marine biologist.  Steinbeck has his characters speak in  everyday language, which is qite enjoyable.  I reccommend this book to anyone who likes Steinbeck, imagery, or glimpses into ordinary people's lives.  There isn't any huge, spectacular plot climax but it is definately an enjoyable book.	2001-04-08
US	51725673	R26R1VNKU1L3FF	0295956887	149037816	Nisei Daughter	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Beautiful memoir	Nisei Daughter is a one woman's account of what it was like for her to grow up in Seattle being a second-generation Japanese girl.  Her story provides a glipse of historical Seattle, the struggle between 1st and 2nd generation Japanese Americans, what it's like to be a girl in Japanese-American families, and how Japanese/Japanese Americans were treated during WWII. (Her family was sent to an internment camp).  Very moving, I read this book in college as part of a WA state history class but it was so touching that I plan to reread it for pleasure.	2001-02-01

This book is a masterpiece at combining oral history with wonderful personal stories and beautiful photographs.  It's a must for anyone interested in women's history, historical anthrpology, women's studies, or US history.	2001-02-01

Her last book  was about the Seminole Indians and was also quite good.  This book,  &quot;She Who Hears the Sun&quot; is about the Navajo people.  It is a saga  book, somewhat like James Michener, however, this book focuses on women.   The main character is a woman, sure, there are men, but it's a story told  from a female perspective.  As far as the Navajo facts, I am an  anthropologist and speak the Navajo language.  This book is wonderfully  researched without coming across like a textbook.  Two thumbs way way up.	2000-08-14

Plus it discussed all  aspects of WA state and NWern history from European exploration to  Microsoft and Boeing aircraft.  Very complete, used as a textbook for a  college class at the U of Washington.	1999-08-20

Money well spent.  I was already vegitarian, for 8 years, so I don't remember the exact taste of meatloaf, but even if these recipes  aren't exact replicas, they are good.  The meatless/soy reuben is delicious  and the thousand island dressing does taste exactly like the real except  that it's good for you.  Worth a try!	1999-06-11

Wonderfully researched.  Basically a &quot;true story of the Old South&quot; with what it was really like.  No spoiled plantation daughters primping around, but  the story of escaped slaves and the Seminoles, before they were a mascot.	1999-06-04

True, there aren't many concrete facts in this book, but not many concrete facts exist about women's day-to-day history, day-to-day African American slave history, and  slave involvement in the Freedom Train.  This book presents what has  traditionally been an oral history story and &quot;passes it on&quot; to a  wider audience.  I thank the authors and Ozella McDaniel for letting me  share in their community.	1999-06-03

Many color photos of each quilt.  Worth buying just for the beautiful photographs.  After seeing the photos, the history of each quilt was just  icing on the cake.  Many of the quilts that were stolen or sold are traced  to the original maker.  Viewing what these Southern ladies made has  inspired me to put more effort in my quilts!	1999-06-03
