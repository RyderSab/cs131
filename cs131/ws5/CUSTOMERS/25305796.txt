Denning narrates these cases with the ease of a storyteller and at the same time explains how these cases lead to a questioning of law which lead to gradual reforms in law of evidence, abolition of death penalty, changes in attitudes of judges to social issues etc.<br /><br />The cases are sometimes narrated in a naughty tone, sometimes with amusement, sometimes with shame, sometimes with anger - reflecting Lord Denning's moral position as Chief Justice with respect to earlier judges who preceded him - their achievements, their follies, their corruption and their integrity.<br /><br />Denning is a liberal and does not take law as matter-of-fact or given. He believes that law can and was misused and therefore continuous improvement, vigilance and questioning is required. At the same time, he is cautious about his own liberalism - especially because of the way British liberalism spawned trade unionism and international terrorism.<br /><br />This book will delight anyone who wants to understand how present legal principles came into being, and wants to read great and interesting cases that transformed the course of law, not just in Britain, but beyond the shores of Britain as well.	2005-09-29

This out-of-print work by a Pakistani legal theorist, published by minor Lahore based publisher and hardly distributed well enough to attract attention, is one of the most inquiring works into what can serve as a basis for legal interpretation.<br /><br />Written from the standpoint of traditions of interpretation in Islamic legal tradition - ijma, rai, mubaa, istidlal, istihsan etc., the book argues that Islamic Law has become pedantic because of the closing of the gate of ijtihad or interpretation of meaning (legal hermeneutics). This was customory in the early tradition of Islam.<br /><br />It ends with a sharp and insightful principle for legal interpretation - istirahm, which the author believes reflects the true spirit of Islam because each chapter of the Qoran starts with Alif Laam Mim and 'Bismillah e Rehman ur Rahim'. The author argues that the rule for interpretation should be that between two legal opinions the jury should select the more compassionate opinion, in the true spirit of Allah the compassionate one - a challenging if not universally agreed thesis.<br /><br />The book also has a comprehensive and very useful glossary of Islamic legal terms.	2005-09-29

His position is Maliki (the Sunni school dominant in North Africa) although he acknowledges that the Hanifi school (dominant in Asia) is the most liberal.<br /><br />He focuses on Civil law, because traditional criminal law has been abandoned in most Islamic countries, in tune with the times.<br /><br />He covers various aspects of Civil law like inheritance, properties, Waqf, rights of women, etc.	2005-09-29

Al-Muwatta is a collection of ahadith or orally transmitted anecdotes about Prophet Muhammed and his contemproaries (sahaba).<br /><br />Islamic law is divided into Sunni schools based on Shariat and hadith, and Shia schools based on opinions of Imams (Sunnis place an empahsis on canons, while Shias consider the position and views of Imams important - in Aristotlean terms, Sunnis empahsize rule of law and Shias emphazize rule of enlightened individuals).<br /><br />The Maliki school of law is one of the dominant and widespread schools and governs or inspires much contemporary law in North Africa. The other ones are Shafie, Hanbali (dominant in Saudi Arabia) and Hanifi (dominant in Asia).<br /><br />Islamic law books like Al-Muwatta differ from Fatwas issued by bodies which are of a more transient imporntance. And they discuss not just law and punishment but also ethics, codes of conduct, customs, mores etc. In this respect, they share the more encompassing nature of all ancient canons from Talmud to Dharmashastras.<br /><br />Al-Muwatta covers anecdotes on topics like Hajj (pilgrimage), property laws, inheritance laws, criminal laws, dietary regulations, social relations, upkeep of places of worship, rites of sacrifice, code of conduct for war and a lot more.<br /><br />It also gives a glimpse of the liberal spirit of Islam and especially of Prophet Muhammed like the Prophets ideas on compassion to animals, simple-minded folk etc.<br /><br />More than that it gives an idea of customs and mores of Muhammed's time. The anecdotes also show the tolerance preached by Muhammed in contrast with zealotry of some of his followers.	2005-09-28

He is smart enough to weave causal explanations into a narrative mode. He does not name individual migrants, ships, dates of migration, quotes of Historians or cities of Europe and America. His history is not about individuals. It narrates the story of 'people' - that is migrants in a collective sense.<br /><br />This book is written with a rare sensitivity. The descriptions of the ordeal of 'uprooting' and finding new roots are deeply moving. Some of most moving passages deal with the struggle to be able to afford a sea voyage; disease, starvation and death in over-crowded decks/cabins; and utter helplessness on landing in a new land.	2005-09-28

This book pertains to ontology rather than metaphysics in a wider sense. (Ontology is regarded as one of the branches or subjects of inquiry comprising metaphysics).<br /><br />And this is in no way a textbook on metaphysics or an introduction to the subject of metaphysics (I picked it up when I did not know who Heidegger was and wanted a quick introduction to 'metaphysics' about which I was hazy then. But I ended up loving this book for a different reason).<br /><br />This however does not discount the value of the book. The book asks and seeks to answer the question 'Why are there beings rather than nothing?' (in the older transaltion -- beings = essents). It then moves on to the questions like what is Being, what is the meaning of Being, what are the limits of Being, what are the etymological origins of Being (not the etymology of the word, but of the concept - including Greek and Latin equivalents) etc.<br /><br />The book explains the sense of 'limitedness' latent in the concept of Being through etymological connections with terms like polis, for example.<br /><br />In the last chapter, Heidegger dileneates Being from its four boundary conditions - thinking (as contrasted with existing), becoming (changing into another being), appearance (being as perceived by another being) and ought (abstract goal for being).<br /><br />This book clarifies many essential concepts like the ones mentioned in the previous paragraph by delineating them from a lot of muddle that has been written about them by many other philosophers. If there were to be an alternative title for this book,'The Concept of Being' captures it best.	2005-09-27

I started reading this book because the title 'Soul Mountain' seemed very evocative. I ended up reading a work that exceeded my initial expectations of it.<br /><br />This semi-autobiographical travelogue, if I may call it that (this work defies easy characterization in terms of genre), is based on the authors five-month travels in peripheral provinces of China among the Miao, Yi, Jiangsu, Tibetan, and Qiang people.<br /><br />The author mixes this with his fantasies and day-dreams and philosophical reflections on a wide range of topics - men and women, history, nostalgia, madness, loneliness, pain, archaeology, nature, conservation, environment, Buddhism, Daoism, occult, sorcery, banditry etc.<br /><br />The novel has two interwoven streams - one is the authors fantasies of woman and the other is his travel experiences.<br /><br />In a writing style that seems a curious mixture of that of French and Chinese writers, the author gives poetic descriptions of pain, wonder, astonishment, degradation, fear, terror, hunger, fatigue, nature, folk songs, history, ruins, personalities, childhood, sex and so on.<br /><br />The novel is not a story but a road novel. It does not have a beginning, peak and climax. It is a journey - always begun and never ended.<br /><br />I have read about thirty of so 'classic' novels. This one stands out as the most memorable, although this is my subjective opinion.<br /><br />There is no plot to describe here, but everyone will find a lot to identify in this novel.	2005-09-24

This thin book is a collection of Roland Barthes' short pieces on culture. The style of much of the book is journalistic and easy-to-read.<br /><br />In this book, Barthes tries to uncover the mythmaking latent in advertising, films, media articles, exhibitions etc. The selection spawns across diverse subjects to explain why and how Romans are defined as Romans in films (with a fringe cut as a standardized technique), mythmaking inherent in celebration of the mystique of Greta Garbo's face, the use of language to dominate and condemn the illiterate, the rhetoric of advertising margaraine, the meaning and rhetoric of plastic, striptease and wrestling as spectacles etc.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Barthes explains his concept and theory of myth as a sign that has become a signifier for another signified. This portion is of special relevance to those wanting to be initiated into semiology.	2005-09-24

Russia was opening up to the West and the new Russian intelligentisa set out to relentlessly question received opinion through scientific and materialistic reasoning.<br /><br />The novel has little to narrate by the way of plot. The hero collapses without a struggle when his scientific rationalism and aggressive rejection of any explanation except materialistic ones leaves him helpless to deal with the emotion of love he finds within himself when he and a friend meet a intelligent lady in Moscow. He slowly loses out in the triangle, his friend come follower moves aways because of his self-interest and he himself contracts tuberculosis.<br /><br />Yet there is something about Bazarov - the hero - that makes him one of the eternal and powerful literary heroes ever created.<br /><br />It is as if the seed of tragedy is built in the rebel personality trying to challenge and change everything on grounds of reason. So strong and yet so vulnerable as to be unable to deal with simple human emotions and helpless against fate.<br /><br />This novel was Turgenev's argument against the Russian nihilists of his time, but ends up immortalizing the nihilist hero in his failed rebellion. This novel is sure to leave you a little disturbed even one and a half century after Russian nihilism has come and gone.	2005-09-24

While there are many other written textbooks on film theory, I have found the few other textbooks that I encountered either full of trivia or too watered down or almost like commentaries rather than text books.<br /><br />This book examines cinema from the technical, evolutionary and cultural perspectives and also gives the most lucid exposition of the work of various film theorists like Metz, Mitry, Eisentein, Kracauer, Wollen and others.<br /><br />Particularly relevant are the explanations of differences between montage and mise en scene approaches, types of montage and grand syntagmas of cinema (cinematic grammars).<br /><br />It also sounds and reads like a deft synthesis of all that can be said about cinema rather than as a loosely strung collection of information that students might seek.<br /><br />It also contains one of the most comprehensive and relevant bibliographies on film theory.	2005-09-23

This is book is an extremely lucid introduction to the Just-in-Time (JIT) philosophy of Japanese manufacturers and also Total Quality Control (TQC). The author explains why and how Japanese techniques like JIT and TQC yield economic, motivational and processual benefits.<br /><br />The author shows how inventory reduction with input control for quality leads to a long-term benefits in terms of shorter lead time, flexible workers; lower inventory costs; lower storage space; lower marketing costs etc.<br /><br />He also explains plant configurations and organization of production lines that facilitate these improvements; the kanban or pull-system of inventory replenishment in the assembly line; quality control circles and just in time purchasing.<br /><br />While some JIT and TQC principles are more applicable to the manufacturing sector many insights can also be transplanted to government and service sectors if the reader builds parallel connections. For example plant configuration design has interesting insights to offer for office workspace design.<br /><br />On the flip side, the author's enthusiasm for kanban (card-based singalling for material/resource/inventory replenishment) against computer-based material requirements management (MRP) solutions may not seem very prophetic (this book was written in 1982). The author also has a convert's Polyanna enthusiasm.	2005-09-09

Unlike autobiographies written in vanity at the crest of success, this one is written as a melancholic meditation on life, at the crest of what Henry Adams thought was his failure. Adams always refers to himself in third person and in the humorous and abject epithets giving the autobiography the character of a novel or a biography.<br /><br />Henry Adams, was a historian, journalist and political private secretary, with intrests as varied as physics, chemistry, geology, evolution, mathematics, politics, history, and diplomacy. He was the son of a diplomat, Charles Francis Adams. His grand-father was John Quincy Adams the 6th president of USA and great-grand father was John Adams, the 2nd president.<br /><br />Despite being one of the greatest American historians, with a successful career in history, journalism and literature, Adams regarded himself as a failure because he was inconsequential in politics and society as compared to his forefathers and his education based on eighteenth century principles of the founding fathers of USA, imparted through his relatives, peers, school, socity and the Harvard College, was unsuitable to meet the challenges of the world he was to grow into - the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br /><br />Adams believed that the law of acceleration of forces in history lead to a situation where a person trained for a certain level of complexity finds himself at the mercy of forces of a higher complexity as he grows up. This was his theory of history, intimately derived from his experience of life.<br /><br />He felt that all education through parents, school, college, work or life can never in its entirety prepare a person for life, because the society around you changes at an accelerating pace while your education rooted in your parents values and the value of the soceity of your childhood becomes obsolete by the time you need to put it to use. So at each stage of life man always needs to begin his education anew.<br /><br />The merit of this books goes beyond just and insight into education, life or failure. It also illuminates the time from 1838 to 1905. Adams was close to political, literary, artistic and scientific circles in Europe and America and travelled far and wide visiting England, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Egypt, Mexico and Cuba, some of these countries again and again.<br /><br />The books is rich in literary style and historical, literary, scientific, cultural, economic and sociological insights as it analyzes self, peoples, times and cultures.o begin his education anew. <br /> <br />The merit of this books goes beyond just and insight into education, life or failure.

The book consists of a set of empirical studies and was written much before Bourdieu's other works, but was introduced to English readers much later than his better works.<br /><br />The book shows how the education system rewards certain kinds of articulations which subscribe to its jargon and rejects points of view differently articulated (either in terms of the language of articulation or the content of articulation).<br /><br />The insights of the books are a pre-cursor to Bourdieu's educational masterpiece 'Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture', which exposed the mechanisms of power that operate in determining educational oppurtunities and rewards.<br /><br />This particular book, however, pales in comaprison to the writer's later work and the monumental work of Basil Bernstein (Class, Codes and Control, 3 vols.) who preceded Bourdieu and inspired him.<br /><br />The biggest weakness of the book perhaps is that it is empiricism in the way the French do it, rather than the way Germans or Anglo-Saxons do it. It is more journalistic than based on rigor of method. The questionnaires administered are lop-sided. Statistical quality control is almost absent.<br /><br />This is not to deny that it offers insights of value. But it is preferable to seek the insights in Bourdieu's more mature works, rather than spend the same amount of time over this half-way house of poor empiricism and weakly articulated theory.	2005-08-17

Yet it represents the same themes that pervade his other novels - not belonging to society and trying to vindicate yourself by taking a challenging route.<br /><br />The novel discusses an old fisherman's struggle with a porpoise he sympathises with and how victory proves futile but does not break the old man's dreams.<br /><br />In this respect it is a philosophical reflection on the meaning, negation of meaning and search for new meaning in life.	2005-07-13

In this book he makes distinctions which have later become central to discussions of linguistics like:<br /><br />1. Sign as the unity of signifier (letters, sounds, image) and signified (meaning implied by the signifier)<br /><br />2. Language (langage) as the unity of langue (code - language as a system) and parole (usage)<br /><br />3. Syncrhonic (language as static system) and diachronic lingustics (langauge as an ever changing, evolving system)<br /><br />4. Retrospective (language evolution so far) and prospective linguistics (future evolution of a language).<br /><br />Many linguists have added a cloud of debate over these concepts, but non explains as lucidly as the master who propounded these. For those confused bout semiotics, semiology etc., this work is a reference point for the original meaning of the term 'semiology' as intended by Saussure. Many of Saussure's binary distinctions became the central to an approach to social sciences called structuralism which still holds sway in social sciences.	2005-07-13

The book begins with the case of Abraham's decision to sacrifice Isaac because God had ordered him to. The choice of the case is tied to Kierkegaard's desire to exposit on the conflict between ethical and religious modes of existence and show why the religious mode is a higher mode of existence.<br /><br />Abraham's sacrifice was something that has debatable ethics. However, it is not as simple as a religion-obsessed man sacrificing his son. Abraham and Sarah got the son by appealing to Yehovah. And the same Yehovah asks Abraham to sacrifice his son. Abraham's dilemma does not end there. He has to hide the sacrifice from Sarah and from Isaac. He needs to take Isaac with him using Isaac's trust in his father. He needs to take Isaac away using Sarah's trust in Abraham. He needs to do that with the consciousness that he is betraying that trust. And he has to cope with his own conflicting emotions of love for his son, guilt about abusing trust, and his own trust in god. Kierkegaard goes on to explain that it is his trust in god that allowed Abraham to do this - a trust that god would not really want the sacrifice to happen, a trust that god would return his son.<br /><br />From this, Kierkegaard goes on to prove why a 'teleological supsension of the ethical' is possible and why ethics is not sufficient to serve as a basis for spirituality.	2005-07-08

He made very objective studies of values, sympathy, sociology of knowledge and sociology of culture. This is one of his masterpieces in which he tries to phenomenological differentiate and explain the meaning of 'sympathy'.<br /><br />The book differentiates the concept of sympathy from related concepts like fellow-feeling, commiserisation etc. He argues how sympathy is not the same as these concepts and why sympathy is not a form of enlightened self-interest either.<br /><br />Particularly interesting are his arguments against Adam Smith's theory of moral sentiments in which fear motivates sypathy and Freud's concept of guilt as source of such feelings. He also shows how Buddha's concept of universal misery blocks compassion by accepting misery matter-of-factly and expecting everyone to accept and live their misery. The book concludes that sympathy is made possible by empathy but is an irreducible feeling.	2005-07-08

Camus explains in the beginning that while his previous work was about the question of suicide, this one is about the other aspect of taking human lives - other people's lives (murder). The book however is not so much about murder, as it is about the ethics of rebellion.<br /><br />At a deeper ideological level, Camus was reacting to the excesses of Soviet style communism with which he disagreed. He felt that rebellion is always at the risk of falling prey to the very tyranny it revolts against and destroys.<br /><br />Camus however does not believe that rebellion is therefore not desirable. His humanitarian ideals harmonize with the dream of rebellion. So he tries to answer the question of how rebellion can escape falling prey to tyranny, albiet unsuccessfully, by taking the examples of Russian nihilists who fought tyranny through murder, but nevertheless punished themsleves for that act (because the act of murder becomes tyrranny if routinized).<br /><br />In all his works, Camus is generally good with analysis but poor in his conclusions. This book is brilliant for its analysis of the ethics of rebellion and the dilemmas of a rebel. It raises important questions and leaves you free to find your own answers. That also harmonizes better with the spirit of existentialism.	2005-07-07

Camus believes that it is the absurdity and meaninglessness of our lives that drives us to suicide.<br /><br />He compares the absurdity to the myth of the greek hero Sisyphus who was condemned to roll a huge rock uphill for eternity. Camus proceeds to uncover the entire existential psychology of The Absurd, but concludes that one's own life is not worth taking.<br /><br />He then proceed to demonstrate through a collection of anecdotal essays, how human beings can construct meaning from life. His other essays in the book do give a hint about how to find meaning in life, but may not be persuasive enough for someone too much in the dumps.<br /><br />The logical connection between his analysis and conclusion is weak, but the analysis is brilliant.

The bulk of this book concerns his journalistic writings on the Algerian Revolution, Soviet Union etc. Through these essays, you understand the pain of Camus. Camus' ethics doesn't agree to mindless violence for the sake of power. He makes an impassioned plea for tolerance and humanitarian solutions to the problems of war and peace.<br /><br />Camus is not necessarily logical or politically correct. His stand on the issue of independence of Algeria is a compromised position between French imperialism and Algerian aspirations for freedom during that period. However, in his passion for diagnozing the problems of his time and addressing them, he hits upon a lot of interesting insights and arguments.<br /><br />Particularly brilliant for both its analysis and its conclusion is Camus' landmark long essay 'Reflections on the Guillotine' which occupies a fair part of the book. In this essay, Camus systematically demolishes all legal or quasi-moral justifications for capital punishment and answers the third aspect of the question - Whether human life is worth taking?<br /><br />In his 'The Myth of Sisyphus', he had argued against self-murder. In 'The Rebel', he argued against murder and genocide. In this essay, he argues against legalized murder. But unlike his earlier works where he offered weak arguments after a brilliant analysis, here he hits the mark by demolishing the justifications for capital punishment, totally.

Written by a person of aristocratic predisposition against fascism and communism, and also democracy, this book was ironically celebrated by democratic, capitalist countries for its denunciation of Bolshevism and fascism as false starts.<br /><br />The aristrocratic (anti-people) strain in the arguments apart, the book represents a powerful analysis of what 'power to the people' does.<br /><br />Ortega y Gasset correctly diagnoses the rise of expectations that results from democratization of politics, improvement in quality of life and involvement of the masses, as the reason why societies push themselves toward tyrannical systems.<br /><br />Ortega y Gasset blames the 'increase of life' as the reason why more people want to have a say in politics and the destiny of their country make tyrannical demands for control of others and furtherment of their objectives and finally yield to demogogues who seem to promise such tyrannical solutions.<br /><br />This book is a strange kind of a cure and a strange kind of a poison. By analyzing how the very liberal principle of democratization contributes to tyranny he debunks 'the revolt of the masses' but at the same stroke weakens the ideological support structure for democracy.	2005-07-07

Ortega y Gasset's dialectic is open-ended. Unlike Hegel he does not rush you from a concept to its opposite and than take you to a different plane altogether.<br /><br />Central to Ortega y Gasset's philosophy of history is how each generation respons to a crisis that it inherits and resolves it to take society on a higher level. But no great insights are missed by not reading the book. They are covered by other thinkers in a better way.	2005-07-07

It draws heavily from Husserl's phenomenology and is one of the earliest attempts at a phenomenological sociology. Ortegay y Gasset seeks to answer the question 'Why man needed society?' His analysis resonates with that of George Herbert Mead in some resepcts.<br /><br />He proceeds by reflecting on the relationship between self and others, and the mystery of the human need for other human beings. He offers numerous phenomenological arguments to explain why society is needed and why our consciousness presupposes others.<br /><br />Particularly brilliant are his observations on the psychology of handshake (Why does a person feel awkward if he/she gets a lukewarm handshake?), interpretation of eye gaze (What makes a certain gaze so alluring and tempting?) and animal anxiety.<br /><br />He rests his argument for society by reflecting on animal anxiety which is too pre-occupied with danger to be able to concentrate. Animals therefore cannot develop society or have higher mental functions. It is the leisure of human beings and their freedom from such anxiety that makes civilization possible. And it is society that reduces anxiety to allow human beings their 'mindspace'.	2005-07-07

The book argues that oral cultures are synaesthetic and work with synthetic logic, while cultures of writing push the mind toward singulation of senses, logic and 'perspective'.<br /><br />McLuhan 'glosses' through a wide range of scattered historical pieces of information to show how oral, written and print cultures have different patterns. He ably shows how printing also transformed art, architecture, society and industry.<br /><br />The book is thoroughly historical, dense and rich in informative detail. It forms the foundation for McLuhan's clearer theoretical articulation of his ideas in 'Understanding Media', but is more accessible to the layman.<br /><br />This book belongs to a pantheon of books that revolve around similar ideas like Harold Innis's 'Empire and Communications' & 'The Bias of Communication'; Walter J. Ong's 'Orality and Literacy' and William J. Ivins's 'Print and Visual Culture' and 'Art and Geometry'. But this is the most sweeping, convincing, dramatic statement of the common theory proposed by these various writers.<br /><br />And for those who love theory with a dose of history, this makes for really delightful reading.	2005-07-05

The essential premise of symbolic interactionism is that all human action is essentially symbolic and that society is to be understood, not as a closed system to be studied in abstraction, but as a network of endless interactions in which human beings symbolically interpret human behavior, speech and thought. Society is the interiorised 'other' or a projected interpretation of societal 'others'. Human self therefore has a free component or I and a bound component or We.<br /><br />This book is an essential reading for whosoever wants to understand sociology and also the departure of Anglo-American sociology from 'society as a system' approaches. And above all it is a timeless classic that you can enjoy reading for the sheer insights it throws into social behavior.	2005-07-05

The problem it deals with is a classic one for electronics, telecommunications and computing - noise vs. fidelity of data transmitted. The solution it propounds is simple and yet so revolutionary that it charted the course of these fields since it was published.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that 'redundancy' or elimination of noise occurs at infinite time. 'Entropy' or shuffledness allows for some noise and produces more information because it requires reconstruction at the receiving end.<br /><br />The authors support their arguments with simple statistical formulae which explain how entropy and redundancy are inverse of each other.<br /><br />This book has been highly debated by both the people involved in the fields concerned and the people outside the field.<br /><br />Most of the debate surrounds the controversial aspect of Shannon and Weaver's definition of information in engineering terms, which excludes issues like relevance, meaning etc.<br /><br />A great deal of debate also got carried into social sciences and humanities where a new celebration of 'entropy' occured.	2005-07-05

It precedes his second book and cult classic 'The Gutenberg Galaxy', by a decade and a half. This is also quite unique in that it has no relationship with McLuhan's more famous theoretical ramblings.  <br /> <br />In this book, McLuhan takes on myth-making in US society by showing how film posters, comic strips, advertisements, magazine covers, newspaper layout and articles etc., try to persuade people into something, and yet a close observation of their inherent contradictions allows you to escape their machinations. <br /> <br />The book celebrates deliberate misreading of commonplace things like advertising to show how the persuasive trap of mass culture/consumer culture can be escaped.  <br /> <br />All articles in the book follow the format of article/poster/ad, its analysis and some sharp witty aphoristic observations in a boxed area that serve as liberating repartees against the messages that these products of consumer culture intend to send.  <br /> <br />The philosophy of the book is derived from McLuhan's premise (borrowed from Edgar Allan Poe's story 'The Maelstrom') that to escape a maelstrom you need to study things going down and things that resurface and align yourself with things that resurface.  <br /> <br />In this respect, it can be considered a jargon-free precursor of latter-day deconstructive literary and cultural criticism. And it is much more liberating and enlightening to a lay reader than jargon ridden discussions or purely vehement denuciations of the power of mass culture which don't help laymen liberate themselves anyway, because of their highly inaccessible prose.	2005-07-05

And most people who manage to cite the second phrase as his contribution still miss out on his pun 'medium is the massage'.<br /><br />In this book, Marshall McLuhan expands on the scattered ideas of his book 'The Gutenberg Galaxy' into a systematic theory of media. The book has two sections.<br /><br />The first part details his theory of media. There are many fruitful ideas here worth a further study like:<br /><br />1. Medium as at once the message (as it effects in spite of its content rather than because of it) and massage of senses.<br /><br />2. Media as extensions of man (that is, any tool that mediates human action or thought rather than just communication media).<br /><br />2. Hot media (which accentuate senses) and Cold media (which are synaesthetic).<br /><br />3. Hybrid energy released by combination of media.<br /><br />The second part details his interepretations of each medium in terms of his theory, and in accordance with his definition of media, covers things like cars, clothes etc., apart from television, radio, advertising etc.<br /><br />Both McLuhan's general theory of media and his theoretical articulations of a particular medium provoke and inspire a new way of thinking about media, even if the reader might not agree with all his theorizations.	2005-07-01

The Western Canon is one of the thickest tomes, ever written by Harold Bloom. And it has an excellently researched appendix of over 2000 books that represent Western Literature - a list so representative, that you just need to consult it to select your own reading list. There are a few important omissions, but that does not dilute the effort.<br /><br />He also does excellent analysis of about 28 authors he considers representative of Western literature. Chaucer and Cervantes are the only pre-Shakespearean authors.<br /><br />Where he goes wrong is in his eclecticism of mixing acknowledged greats like Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Joyce, Kafka, Proust etc. with figures not as towering. And his neglect of other towering figures in Western Literature.<br /><br />The worst effort in the book is his attempt to extend the brilliant theory of literary influence and anxieties of writers, which he articulated in his 'The Anxiety of Influence' and 'A Map of Misreading' to argue that all Western writers suffer from an anxiety of not being able to equal or excel Shakespeare.<br /><br />The most interesting part is his critique of Freud's Oedipus Complex and alternative proposition of the more challenging 'Hamlet Complex'.	2005-07-01

Of particular interest is his critique of readings of Rousseau. Accordingly, some of the theorists he discusses are mainly Rousseau scholars.	2005-07-01

More speculative thinking that research and analysis chracterizes many books on the internet.<br /><br />This one, based on a thorough grounding in social psychology and a comprehensive review of empirical literature on the subject, studies how behavior and thinking has got effected by the internet, how we behave offline and online, how going online effects us etc.<br /><br />However, this is a book on the social psychology of the internet and not psychology proper. It's more about how we behave online etc., than about how internet alters cognition. Nevertheless, at the end of reading it, the reader feels a sense of having returned with a much deeper understanding than he or she could have achieved on his/her own.	2005-03-24

This is by far the most comprehnsive and well-rounded statement of both the feminine situation and the feminist position.	2005-03-24

In one manner or other the urge to be the prophet overtakes the urge to be an analyst. This also plagues many books about comptuers and internet.<br /><br />This anthology does not break free from prophesy-mania completely, but many of the contributors like Michael Heim, Katherine Hayles, et al., are far wiser.<br /><br />This book delights the reader by beautifully exploring the meaning of hypertext, meaning of being in a digital world, human reactions to technology etc., without falling back to commonplace platitudes.<br /><br />This makes the book stand-out from the deluge of books in the 1990s which sung paeans to virtual communities, borderless worlds, MUDs, MOOs, cyborgs, end of money, end of copyright, death of distance and other 'social science fiction' fantasies.	2005-03-24

As a feminist and the author of Backlash, where she critiqued the power-maintaining reactions of men to the feminist movement, she sets out to identify how and why men go wrong and ends up investigating the world of masculine pain, angst, decadence and vulnerability. In this book, men come out as weak, flawed, but also heroic.<br /><br />This book analyzes the disintegration of the American man and discuses it in the context of Post-War American history. Faludi points out how unemployment, loss of meaning, breakdown of the family system, the culture of competition and corporatism, Vietnam war, the fashion system, ghetto cultures, etc., systematically contributed to the loss of meaning among American men.<br /><br />Although this book only proclaims to be an anaysis of American Post-War men, much of what it analyzes and describes holds true even in a global context. Vietnam may be a very American wound, but corporatization, consumerism, the culture of ornamentalism, cosmetics, industrial crises, rising unemployment levels etc., make men anywhere in the world today feel more 'hemmed in', than they were a few decades ago.<br /><br />Faludi's basic argument is similar to that of Robert Bly's 'Iron John' and sees the increasing distanciation of fathers from family affairs (due to migration for work), as the reason why most sons have a checquered road to manhood.<br /><br />Her inquiries also show how modern culture tries to deprive men of their softer, maternal affections (positive feminity or 'maternal masculinity' which can enrich men if they adapt it to temper their negative masculinity) and forces the empty ornamental display of self (dressing up, grooming up, dandying up etc. or ornamental masculinity which borrows from weaknesses of women rather their strengths) as the 'model' of masculinity to adopt, after emptying men of their core values.<br /><br />Men, Faludi says, cannot fight the enemy because they cannot name the enemy unlike women who are clear that they want to blame men for their predicament.<br /><br />As a diagnosis of the male predicament in today's culture this book is incisive and thoroughly insightful.ho are clear that they want to blame men for their predicament.

There is something every man will feel while reading this book, whether he agrees with the author or not. Robert Bly and his vision of man is only one of its kind. Other men may or may not look down on certain masculinities as unevolved nor regard some of the evolved versions that Bly points as worth a second thought. But by and large most men who read it will be bound to agree with much of what the author has to say about men.<br /><br />Men live in a void. Gender pyschology excludes the masculine as a pre-given abstract. Some extreme feminist writings reduce masculinity to a unilateral abstraction -- power-seeking, domination-seeking, subjugating, victimizing etc. That's not however what men understand about men.<br /><br />For a long time there was a need for a masculine articulation of what the masculine is. An articulation that cuts across stereotypes, prejudices, and reactive opinions to do justice to the totality that is man.<br /><br />This book does not exactly reach this totality but comes as near as any book I have known. By  allowing men to understand themselves better, this book opens them to realizing what their true self is, way beyond the confusing mass manufactured stereotypes of both 'Man' and 'New Man'.<br /><br />Furthermore, it transforms men by making them aware of their wounds, of unrealistic attempts at escapism and of what can heal them.	2005-03-22

So does this one. It comes at a time when millions of upwardly mobile, English-speaking, urban Indians are reaping the benefits of the economic reforms that the book speaks of. So it strikes a strong chord with Indians who have seen decades of lop-sided development since independence and a sudden boom in the 1990s.<br /><br />As an incisive analysis of defects of bureaucracy and over-regulation it has some merit. But the author carefully selects only those facts of pre-liberalization era which he can easily criticize and only those facts of the liberalization era, he can praise without having a nagging conscience.<br /><br />Therein lies the trap. By refusing to give due wieghtage to achievements of previous decades and refusing to analyze how those achievements laid down the base infrastructure for subsequent growth, the author does a very lop-sided economic analysis of how the liberalization boom came about.<br /><br />A lot of far-sighted planning in terms of education, development of the transport network, etc. laid the foundation for the economic boom and not just the flip of a policy decision.<br /><br />Of course, growth that could have been accelerated was slowed down by wrong policies and a dominating and corrupt bureaucracy, but a growth which could have been aborted was given a lease of life by a commitment of many Indian leaders and bureaucrats with vision.<br /><br />For a sense of how we have progressed and why, a balanced inquiry based on statistics and not skewed by needs of proving the 'hypothesis' would be better.<br /><br />It would also be good to read this book, along with P. Sainath's 'Everybody Loves a Good Drought' or Pavan Varma's 'The Great Indian Middle Class' to know the other side of the coin and understand how different kinds of Indians respond to the same set of developments.	2005-03-22
