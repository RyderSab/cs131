While it does contain a large amount of scary aspects, the book is mostly a very well written, very intelligent examination of one man's experience with the unknown. <br />Strieber's experiences with missing time, bizarre implants, and the now farmiliar Grey creatures are riveting and offputting at the same time. What makes this book really stand out from most of the ufoology is that Strieber really tries to figure out what the &quot;visitors&quot; as he calls them want with us. He comes up with several interesting theories, and the book is fresh and interesting throughout, never bogging down. <br />I would highly recommend this read for the open minded and the curious.	2001-11-13

Sadly, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; was just not up to par. The characters are fairly interesting, but like &quot;Gerald's Game&quot; and &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; there just isn't enough to keep the reader interested.<br />I felt that this book had a lot of potential, but was completely destroyed by rambling writing and tedious attempts to gross the reader out. <br />There was so much more that he could have explored about aliens, but instead this book reads like a pale imitation of &quot;the regulators&quot;.	2001-05-14

This tale has it all: romance, drama, death, heated debates, fame, and revenge. <br />Cathy's need for revenge against Corrine colors all her actions, and prevents her from ever attaining the love she dreams of.<br />The characters are richly drawn and beautiful: Paul, a tragic figure, saintlike and giving, yet very real. Julian, the tortured dancer who is more like Cathy than she cares to admit.  Bart Winslow, an interesting man who seems to be Cathy's soulmate, and Carrie, Cathy's sad frail sister. <br />This is one of the best of the Dollanganger series, and fans of Flowers in the Attic will not be disappointed by the continuing saga of the family. A must read.	2001-03-05

Olivia is portrayed sympathetically here, and I think almost anyone can feel sympathy for her, the tall, gawky, unloved woman. Olivia is a strong woman though, and I love how she twists Malcolm to her advantage. However, we can also see Olivia's sadistic ways that occur when she locks Alicia in the attic. There is definitely some madness within her.<br />The book is moving and sad, never boring. A must for fans of the series.	2001-03-03

She befriends two guys who are bicycling through, and unsuccessfully tries to make them grilled cheese sandwiches to get them to stay! The plot thickens when the three encounter a desperate guy who robs the house. But this book will lead you into questioning what is &quot;right&quot;, and what faith can be placed in authority.

The book portrays in vivid detail what its like to be a girl, in the male dominated society of the 50s. <br />Instead of conforming to the social norms of the day, Legs leads a band of intelligent, free spirited girls to form their OWN world, with their own rules. <br />The characters are well drawn, believable, and loveable. <br />This book is brilliant also, in its depiction of good intentions gone bad, and how easily things can be taken too far. The horrible crime the girls end up committing is almost more horrific and shocking than their own ill treatment.<br />The girls will become farmiliar to you, and join your landscape. Oates's style here is not readily accessible, but worth untangling. <br />The book is passionate and near mythical, a must own.	2001-02-21

The characters are well drawn, and very likeable. <br />This is a classic coming of age story, and though shocking at times, will move you. A must own. A must read. Should be on the top books for the 1990s list.	2001-02-21

I think that this book is also unique because of the vastly different reactions that people have to the characters. <br />This book is a complete tragedy because at so many points, we see how both parties refuse to give in, to compromise, or to let go. <br />The house has become a symbol to Colonel Behrani, a symbol for the only hope for the future he can imagine. <br />Kathi and Leonard have obviously succumbed to a state of alcoholism and codependency, and I think Leonard bears a lot of the blame for the tragic events that transpire. I especially found him distasteful when Kathi is hesitant to drink, and he encourages her, reasoning that cocaine addiction and alcohol addiction are completely different and she shouldn't throw out the baby with the bathwater.<br />Kathi is a fascinating character, so obviously out of control, so lonely, so desperate. She has been shunned by her family, and is really alone in the world. <br />The Colonel's wife is also a deeply moving character, with her love of music, and kind heart. She is the ultimate victim here. <br />This book shows how easily it can be to let yourself be swept along with the tide, unthinking, into unthinkable consequences.<br />A very moving book, and a very readable book, I would highly recommend this to anyone.	2001-02-19

This is the most accessible of Oates books to date, lacking the amorality of &quot;Zombie&quot;, and the feminist power of books of like &quot;Solstice&quot; and &quot;Foxfire&quot; yet emerging as a more commercial book, a more kind book, a book for everyone. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The Mulvaneys were a family which seemed at once farmiliar to me, possibly because I lived in the region the book takes place in. We see the story of the family's decline through the eyes of all the members except Mike &quot;Mule&quot; Mulvaney the oldest. I found Marianne to be one of the most magical literary characters I have encountered for a long time. She is simply saintlike and beautiful and giving. The tragic portrait of humanity of the citizens of Mt Ephraim is both believable and tragic. The character of Patrick is endearingly complex and never predictable. The story moves at a fast gallop, sending your emotions searing. <br />I think that this book is very telling in how easy it is for families to disintegrate in the modern era. It is heartwrenching to witness how a lack of understanding and miscommunication can split a family up, and splinter them permanently. <br /> I found the book moving, true to life, and a triumph. Not to be missed. If you like it try reading Oates's &quot;Because it is bitter, and because it is my heart&quot; and the marvelous &quot;Foxfire&quot;.	2001-02-19

His style is decidedly not readily accessible at times, but he does possess a superior command of the English languague (which doesn't always make for quick reading....)<br />Ned Dunstan is a likeable enough sort, and his adventures in the search for &quot;the truth&quot; are convoluted but interesting. The book takes wild twists and turns, he inherits large sums of money, his mother dies, he hooks up with various women. But the biggest question of the book is, what of his double, Robert? <br />Working in a bit of Lovecraft fare is a cool technique also. This book really cooks in the first half, especially Dunstan's college experience, completely surreal and bizarre. <br />&quot;Mr. X&quot; is not an easy read by any means, but is ultimately worth it.	2001-02-19

The Gilly Melt is quite tasty, and I am very intrigued by &quot;Wheel-of-Creation-Vegan-Organic-No-Electricity-Sprouted-Wheat-Berry Pizza&quot;, I long for a wheat grass grinder.

Boston Brown Bread was fun to make, and absolutely delicious.  There are many bread recipes and ideas of how to make the bread appealing to children utilizing ingenuity. My favorite part of this book however is the Chapter 2: Fillings and Spreads. I find myself frequently eating cheese sandwiches for breakfast, lunch and dinner and this book is helping me branch out. Peanut-Yeast Spread is pretty tasty, as is Tofu Salad. I look forward to trying the others like Tofu-nut spread, Sesame-Avocado Spread-and Vegnut Spread. There are many other spreads.  I also like the fact that these recipes don't make a huge amount. It is perfect for creating meals for one person. Also, there are good recipes for meatless gravies in here, like Nut gravy, and Dal Gravy to name a few. It's a great resource.	2001-01-10

Is Rue a vegetarian? k.d. lang contributes a recipe for Indonesian Salad with Spicy Peanut dressing. Even Kevin Nealon from SNL contributes a tasty recipe. My favorite section of the book has to be the deserts though. I made &quot;Peanut Butter Drops&quot; recently and they recieved rave reviews. Like many people, I only drink soy milk, and it is great to have recipes that are made with soy milk in mind, sometimes it is difficult because the soy milk can flavor some dishes in a not so great way. The Spinach and Cashew Salad is great also. I look forward to picking some phat recipes from this book to bring to my best friend's wedding picnic.  It's a must have.	2001-01-10

I was thrilled with it. Lauren Butts has created a fun and easy cookbook for anyone. I love the layout of the cookbook, it is divided into sections, and I enjoyed her nutritional info in the front of the book. Maybe it will inspire more teens to go veg.I found this cookbook full of great meatless recipes. I must warn strict vegetarians and vegans however, that most recipes contain dairy products, or eggs. There is a great recipe for &quot;Nathan's Blueberry Breakfast Cupcakes&quot;, that is easy to make and tastes like store bought. However when I tried to get my three year old neighbor to eat one, he refused in horror. Other recipes that I have enjoyed making include: apricot chimichangas, Thai tofu Veggie Wrap-yum, Burrito Roll up, Veggie Pitas (Tastes the same as Wendy's veggie pita), Layered Nacho Salad, Mock Caesar Salad (in case you didn't know, Caesar Salad dressing is typically made with ANCHOVIES-fish=meat), Chilled Berry Soup-this is a fabulous recipe I made last summer when berries were plentiful, it is totally tasty and makes a great meal, TASTY FLATBREAD PIZZA WITH ARTICHOKE HEARTS!! This pizza was so unbelievably tasty, I have always been a bit wary of artichoke hearts, they just look kind of disgusting you know, but I was so shocked to discover their delicious taste!! Veggie Quesadillas were also fabulous. SPAGHETTI PIE is indeed a great dish, and I like to make it when serving non-vegetarians. It has been a hit with everyone so far. Tofu McNuggets are the absolute bomb. These recipes are only a fraction of the great ones in this book. I would highly recommend it to parents of new young vegetarians, or college students like myself who don't have that much time to cook.  Some have opined that this book is full of recipes that are fattening, but I think most know, that us vegetarians are a mostly lean lot, and I can personally attest that the recipes aren't fattening. Thanks Lauren for creating a great book, it is indeed an oasis as far as Veg cookbooks go. Its great to have a cookbook that isn't full of really long, hard to find, expensive ingredients!	2001-01-10

The main problem with Moonfall is that it is rather tedious, and not really scary. This is because there is simply too much description of the gargoyles. Tamara Thorne creates this fascinating character of Dr. Dashwood, and a bunch of twisted nuns, and then focuses in on these goofy gargoyles??? You will guess who/what the gargoyles are early on. I really liked the characters of the book, Minerva-an old healer, Sara Hawthorne, John Lawson, and Mark his son are all interesting personalities.  Unlike Haunted however, the book was kind of long and at times boring. Too often, the same issues were reiterated endlessly.  I wish Tamara Thorne would write more books, in the vein of Haunted however. While this is not great, its still a lot better than a lot of horror floating around out there.	2001-01-07

I was so glad that I did. This intriguing tale is about a very strange young woman in a mental institution with terrifying powers. It is also the story of a husband and wife struggling to make their marriage succeed. The husband-a smug pychiatrist works at the institution where &quot;the visitor&quot; is housed. The story is fast paced and rewarding, though pretty gruesome at times. Its fabulous.	2001-01-05

The book is the tale of Dave, a 15 year old high school student. Like many teens, he is experiencing family problems. His stepfather is callous and cruel to him. His mother is an ineffectual drinker. Dave smokes pot, skips classes, and is generally fed up, so he runs away from home.<br />This book has lost none of its power over the years. Its structure is truly interesting, the story is told utilizing different narrators: the people Dave encounters during his run, and from the point of view of the people he left behind.<br />Though written for teens, the book doesn't mince around with the realities of life on the streets. If anything it is even more relevant when we the readers of 2000 realize the threat of AIDS rather than gonorea or VD. <br />I don't think this book should fade into oblivion, I think it should be reissued and that almost everyone would enjoy it. Maybe future Social Workers could read it.	2001-01-03

At first, I hated him for the HORRIBLE despicable abuse he inflicted on poor Annette, but Ms Monroe interestingly made Annette remember some of the good things about Mr. Boatwright. Rhoda's character is truly complex also. Also, for all the serious issues in the book, it is SO funny, I laughed out loud at many points.

Jo is a woman who seems to have it all, yet feels bored and restless. I feel that many people will identify with her longing to relive her youthful days of adventure. The characters are vividly drawn, and interesting. This book examines a very frightening moral dilemna whose implications are startling. I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2000-11-22

This book makes us believe that things really can be ok and even better after ending a relationship.	2000-11-22

The characters are complex and the writing style is truly admirable, and well structured. A fascinting depiction of an era and a relationship between two sisters. I was particularly entranced by the use of setting in this book, Amanda's &quot;island&quot; and the symbolism of &quot;drowning&quot;. I read this book in merely two days and can't wait for the next book by this new author.	2000-11-02

My favorite King villian Randall Flag aka The Dark Man aka The Walkin' Dude is one of the main characters of this great read by King. The story is aimed at a younger audience, and my elementary school students love it.  This is a kinder, softer, King that doesn't get gory on us here. The story  is an enjoyable fantasy and fun to read.	2000-06-13

The story is extremely suspenseful, poetic, and intelligent.  &quot;Library Policeman&quot; is similiar to &quot;It&quot;  and a short story in &quot;nightmares and dreamscapes&quot; about a teacher  and &quot;changed&quot; children. &quot;The Sun Dog&quot; is great because  of its connection to the Castle Rock tales and a must if you liked  &quot;The Dark Half&quot;, &quot;Needful Things&quot;, and  &quot;Cujo&quot;, many characters from these stories turn up. I was  surprised to find that I HATED &quot;the langoliers&quot;, like a Rod  McKuen poem, this story reeked of false sentiment. It was corny and  unbelievable. King isn't always really original, I can say that and still  be a huge King fan, but in this story he doesn't even put his usual great  twist and special magic to a tired premise. After I finished the story, I  felt let down and wanted to know who exactly the Langoliers were!  The only  likeable character was the bad guy, Mr. Craig Toomy. The others were just  caricatures. I especially disliked the use of Dinah the &quot;little blind  girl&quot; blechhhhh. But the other 3 stories make up for this stumble.	2000-06-09

Its connection to the Dark Tower series is interesting and I hope we see the characters in it again. The kindly boarder, the use of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, the cruelty of  children are all elements of this intriguing tale. The other shining tale  is the one of the college students who become obsessed with Hearts. Anyone  who has experienced life in a college dorm knows how easily obsessions  begin be they drinking, computer games or whatnot, and lead students far  astray from their work. This story is also a beautiful love story and was  very touching. The other stories were pretty weak however. Blind Willie was  unbearably predictable, boring and farmiliar. Skip it. The final tale tying  the threads together was also weak. But the two stories I mentioned were  blockbusters!	2000-05-04

I toy with the idea of naming my child &quot;Alma&quot;. This book is sheerly beautiful, scary, romantic, eery, and sad. The ghost replies to the  question, &quot;who are you?&quot; &quot;i am you&quot;.  Straub's writing  style is truly unique and there are poetic passages in this book that take  my breath away. His characters are very well developed, strong, and  sympathetic. Also notice that the last names of his characters are a  tribute to great gothic writers=Sears James (Henry James) Ricky Hawthorne  (Nathaniel Hawthorne) etc. The evil in this book is NOT simple and the book  doesn't have the traditional wrapped up cathartic happy ending, but how  could it?  Many reviewers diss this book because of this, but they don't  see that that is the point.  The movie isn't that bad, it just bears no  relation to this ground breaking book. Read it if you enjoy the work of  Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, Richard Matheson, Robert Bloch, and Robert  Marasco. You won't be dissappointed. Also, I was thrilled by the reference  to Route 17!	2000-04-29

The book is sheerly one of the most horrific and terrifying studies in evil and obsession I have ever  read. I first saw the marvelous (and also out of print!) film &quot;The  Haunting of Julia&quot; starring the incomparably marvelous Mia Farrow, and  then read the book. Both are great, though the book is more complex. I  would recommend seeing the movie first however because then you can picture  the wonderful house it is set in. The horror of a dominating spouse-Magnus  is here....There is great suspense, who is haunting Julia, is it her  beloved Kate?  Or someone else.....Olivia Rudge is absolutely the most  frightening ghost I have ever read about. The book scared me so much I  couldn't sleep for a week or get the horrid frightening images out of my  mind!  I love the character of sweet Julia and this is a testament to  Straub's great writing ability. This book is GOTHIC horror at its best, and  has a twisty ending also.	2000-04-29

The book has some real terror in it. I found some of the characters VERY unlikeable though. Like latter era King, Straub suffers from overwriting  and needs a better editor.

Like Gerald's Game, this book doesn't have enough of a plot to keep you interested. It is basically just this little girl wandering about the woods, and trying to survive. King is an enigma because in latter years he is trying to write  diffently than his successful ventures!  He needs to stick with what he  began with-horror, suspense, etc. This story should be labeled young adult.  I think teens might enjoy it. Maybe.	2000-04-27

Jack Torrance is a complex and interesting man (this does not come off in Kubrick's film). The failures, the rage, the weakness for drink, versus the kindness, the writer....The Overlook's horrors are many and are unbelievably creepy-the  topiary animals, the haunted ballroom, the masquerade....Danny's psychic  abilities are also eery and scary in themselves. This is the only King book  which I actually find terrifying. It is not to be missed.	2000-04-27

The Stand is the ultimate reading experience.....the deadly superflu, the vivid and likeable characters, romance blooming in a dead earth.....Humanity is scrapped in the stand, and is destroyed fittingly by itself. I find the premise unerringly fascinating, how can the survivors  rebuild a society? what society will they rebuild?  Then there is Randall  Flagg. He is King's scariest villian, absolutely frightening...This book  can absolutely not be missed, buy it asap, its great to reread also. The  uncut version is vital.

Don't be put off by the gory operation at the beginning of the book, read on. Tad Beaumont is a lyrical interesting  character, the use of the birds, the colleague, the sheer evil of George  Stark all combine to make a fast exciting read. The book is absolutely  delightful and makes you think. Read &quot;Insomnia&quot; to find out what  became of dear Mr. Beaumont.	2000-04-27

Everyone likes the Shawshank Redemption but it infuriates me due to the writing flaw of too much coincidence and luck. Frequently King wraps things up too neatly, his characters SUDDENLY know exactly what to do as if a lightbulb goes off or  something. These stories are really long, which is not a flaw in itself,  but they just aren't interesting or exciting in any way. Its a weak effort  at best, and one should read Night Shift or Skeleton Crew instead.	2000-04-27

The book is like an exciting lifetime battered woman movie, with the battered spouse escaping the hellish situation. The friends that Rose makes at the shelter are realistic depictions of women, and Rose is such a sympathetic likeable character. The  supernatural elements involving the painting, fox, etc are so fabulous and  surreal. The supernatural used here in my opinion really really works and  is just great. Don't Miss Rose Madder.	2000-04-27

The captivity, the plight of being paid to &quot;create&quot;, the sheer malevolence of Sheldon's nemesis is fasincating because we see a bit of ourselves in Sheldon's &quot;Number One Fan&quot;... The mocking of the romance genre was really enjoyble and broke  the tension. This book captivates you from page one and won't let you go,  you will feel you are imprisoned with Paul, at the will of a  madwoman.....Kathy Bates is SUPERIOR in the film by the way. don't miss  either one.	2000-04-27

The next two books were great also, though a bit uneven......King gets a little too bogged down with the Odetta stuff. I was so psyched for Wizard and Glass, and then I found myself bored by it. This  book needs some serious editing. There is an interesting, though not great,  story buried in there somewhere if we can wade through and through and  through....I hate to say it, but this book was actually BORING King seems  like he doesn't know where to go next with this Tower series.	2000-04-27

Not every story is good: watch out for Jerusalem's Lot it is an homage to Lovecraft and gothic novels but is just dull and boring, also look out for Night Surf, it lacks definition and  is a waste of time, but other than these scant two tales the book seriously  is a great read!  The best stories in it are &quot;I Am the Doorway&quot;  &quot;The Boogeyman&quot; &quot;The Mangler&quot; &quot;Strawberry  Spring&quot; and &quot;one for the road&quot;. I read this book a few years  ago, but these stories stick in my mind, and I reread them frequently. They  are really original and scary.	2000-04-26

It is so much more than a book about a haunted car...The characters are so wonderful. We see Dennis and his family, Arnie and his family etc etc. I think that King has captured the adolescent experience  again with Arnie, a pimply nice kid transformed into something....else upon  his meeting Roland LeBay and CHRISTINE. I first read this freshman year of  college and the book is so EMOTIONAL, it makes you feel things....The book  is also romantic and about friendship and good vs evil.  I love every  aspect of this book. The writing is tight and the story is realistic, and  not without humor.	2000-04-26

I liked Nightmares and Dreamscapes though there are a few clunkers, its definitely a must have for King Completists. &quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot; has to be my favorite King short story ever. This  Bradburyish tale is so cool. I also loved &quot;Dolon's Cadillac&quot; its  kind of like &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;. &quot;The End of the Whole  Mess&quot; was really clever and original.

The parts of the book I liked best are the flashbacks to the  college days and the experiments. There is something so evil about these  that it gives me the creeps!

My very favorite  story is &quot;Nona&quot;, it freaked me out for days!  Another reviewer  compares these stories to a Tales From the Crypt episode.

I don't think you can classify it as horror, maybe more as gothic suspense or such. Though there are shocking moments, &quot;Give me that its my dustcatcher!&quot; It is mostly a love  story. The lost wife, the beautiful young mother both become very special  to the protagonist. The psychic child is endearing...I love the villians,  the old man with his oxygen mask etc. The horror of Sarah Laughs.....Though  some things are contrived, the book is beautiful and fascinating.

I love Bobbi and especially the endearing alcholic writer &quot;Gard&quot;. The townspeople are great. The alien takeover is  realistic and so so creepy.

Though written in the early 70s we still see the same types walking the halls today-the Carries,  the popular bitchy rich girl, the Sue Snells and Tommys and so on. In the  film, Carrie is the beautiful Sissy Spacek. Sissy would never be the Carrie  that is in this book, that Carrie we are told has stains under her  armpits....Carrie's humiliation and the destruction she unleashes are not  to be missed. This is vintage Early King, he says its raw and somewhat  disses it, but it is his best work.	2000-04-26

The whole interplay between the possessed Seth, and Audrey was great. I also enjoyed that the book, in the style the great novel Dracula was written (I can't  remember the name for this type of literature where different things are  interposed ie journals, letters, etc) We have Audrey's diary, screenplays  (phony) and letters to tell the story along with traditonal writing. I  loved this book because of the interplay between Seth and Audrey. The  ending, corny though it may be left me in tears! The use of such  commonplace items as Spaghettios and Hershey's syrup, and kids toys helped  make this book great. My only question is, in Desperation God is such a big  part of the story yet not mentioned in Regulators at all. Why is this?	2000-04-26

US	50131948	R1CADXM5N9UXQE	0960666605	552858977	Instant Success for Classroom Teachers: New and Substitute Teachers Grades K Through 8	Books	1	41	55	N	N	Useless	Perhaps they do things differently in New York state than they do in Arizonia, but this book's activities and ideas are [useless for me.] <br />Problem Number One: Yes, sometimes a substitute teacher will go in with virtually no plans, but generally the teacher's planbook is open and available and anyone can figure out how to proceed with the daily tasks. Rapport builders, and your own activities are not needed, there is work to be done.<br />Problem Number Two: The discipline section was the main reason that I purchased this book. Yet, the very few pages about it recommended ridiculous advice. It is NOT a good idea to give attention to a troublemaker and let HIS good behavior earn the rest of the class &quot;free time&quot;. Also, this whole &quot;free time&quot; concept is outlandish. The children when not assigned a task or activity go wild.  Letting them &quot;talk quietly&quot; is a complete joke.... <br />I was really disappointed with it and have returned it.	2000-04-25

Desperation is a good read, but....<br />I felt let down when the book ended. He could have done so much more...The end was  relentlessly cornball, yuck.<br />Also, why does EVERY CHARACTER SK writes  have to either a writer or a teacher?  Variety please.<br />I think maybe  King's prolific self is his own worst enemy. A good editor could turn good  into great if they dared to edit the King.<br />Reread the Stand or It or  Insomnia instead.	2000-04-24

It is mostly great for  the list in the back recommending Books and Movies. Through that list I  read many great books like Robert Marasco's Burnt Offerings and Thomas  Tryon's The Other and  and Black House by Paul Theroux. But readers let us  bear in mind that this book is OLD, most of his recommendations are sadly  OUT OF PRINT and impossible to find. I carry the list around with me and  search at flea markets, garage sales, and ebay when I can. My only beef  with my beloved Mr. King is that he disses the FABULOUS movie &quot;Don't  Look In the Basement&quot;, I am absolutly puzzled by his panning of this  gem, it embodies all that he purports to enjoy. I also would caution  potential readers of the younger generation like myself that there is a lot  in this book that you won't relate to ie just skip the whole radio  section!!! And also I HATE that movie Them. But anyways, the book is a good  read, fans of King should buy it.	2000-04-18

I stumbled upon it a few years ago and was absolutely thrilled by it!  This man is an obvious horror fan and while I don't always agree with every review he really has a respect and unbiased  view of the genre. Plus the book is full of humor and wit, he is a great  writer. I would love to see an updated version come out!  I rented many  movies based on his recommendations and was thrilled with the results. A  book like this helps the horror fan to sort through junk like &quot;The  House where evil dwells&quot; to find a great flick like &quot;Black  christmas&quot; (honestly, the cover of that vid is cool but it looks like  it would be super gross instead of the intelligent chiller it is! ) I can't  say enough good things about this book.	2000-04-17

The use of the dolls, the setting of the house....the likeable characters, and the great humor in the story all combine to make a FABULOUS reading experience! I loved this book and I know I'll have fun rereading it again. If you liked Ghost Story,  The Shining, or Matheson's Hell House you'll love this one.	2000-04-12

I totally loved and identified with the character Wendy. The book is rich in atmosphere and while it isn't really scary, its super entertaining! Its kind of a  horror/action hybrid. The writing is great. It was a really fun read, I  read it in only two days!  I would highly recommend it if your looking  for a suspensful horror novel, it also has great humor in it too.	2000-04-06

The plight of the poor Scott Carey is so moving and disturbing. The book makes you ponder the question, &quot;what makes a man a man&quot;. This story will  cause you to question your own place in the universe. It is witty, and  absolutely addicting. I read it in a day.	2000-03-28

Though written in the early 1970s these books have a lot to say about our divorce happy society and the effects on children. The characters of Jenny, Chloris, and Fidel Mancha are very true to life and likeable. I love all three of the Chloris books and I would highly recommend them all,  especially to children of divorce.	2000-03-23

I had seen the movie before reading the book and enjoyed it immensly. This book has a lot of strange soft porn in it that was  definitely absent from the movie. I didn't think it added anything to the  story. I found the book genuinely frightening and mean-spirited.  Particularly the fate of the poor medium Florence really struck me as  horrible. I think the author simply goes to far. He certainly manages to  shock, I don't want to give the plot away but I found the death in the  chapel of one of the main characters so distasteful and shocking that I  almost stopped reading right there. I found the ending of the book  particularly frustrating. It was too simplified. I think it would have been  better and made more sense if everythign weren't so spelled out (and in  such a ridiculous way). I am a fan of horror novels and movies but I  wouldn't recommend this book. The movie is MUCH MUCH Better and less  offensive.	2000-03-10
