Like the first book, it is written on two levels at once: one for kids (appropriate for grades 4+) and the other for teens/adults.  This time, however, the two approaches are so tightly intertwined that this book gives both Harry Potter and Steven King's Dark Tower masterpiece a good run for their money.<br /><br />Read it aloud, it is far more fun that way.  Highly recommended and highly enjoyable.	2005-09-07

Highly recommended for grades 3 through adult	This is fantasy the way it should be written, on two planes: one is the story and the other is the adult-engaging sarcasm and humor. This book is a great pleasure to read out loud to your (older) elementary school child, or to read to yourself just for the sheer fun and escapism.<br /><br />There has been, no surprise, a spate of wizarding fantasy, but this book finds a new approach, a new world, and has virtually nothing whatsoever to do with the Harry Potter-inspired approach to wizards.  In this world, England is divided into Wizards (who run the government and have demons who do their bidding) and commoners (muggles), but the commoners are quite aware of (and perhaps a bit resentful of) the magicians. The magicians themselves spend quite a bit of time scheming to increase their power, and the demons spend most of their time angry about their enslavement in service to the magicians petty needs.<br /><br />In the middle of this comes a young, highly talented, perhaps ambitious apprentice with a conscience who uncovers a dastardly plot.  Things do not proceed in a predictable way, and the book is full of unexpected twists and not a few insights into how people with power actually do behave.<br /><br />This first book in the trilogy has a bit of violence, and younger children will miss some of the humor (maybe most of it) but they will be engaged by the characters and they will be enthralled by the story.  I'd be cautious with children under 9, but if they've read HP, they'll be fine here.<br /><br />We are very much looking forward to reading book 2 and can't wait for the release of book 3.	2005-08-31

It did not reach out and strangle the gay community, innocent babies, transfusion recipients, hemophiliacs, and a good portion of Russia and Africa because it was smarter than we are, faster than we are, or despite out best efforts. It has killed and will kill millions of people because the government of the United States, and the media, in what amounted to a conspiracy of silence, decided not to care.<br /><br />There was no cabal. No one sat down and plotted it. They simply let it happen.  And they did so because it was just affecting Queers (and then later, drug addicts) and poor blacks, and so who really cares?<br /><br />The fact is that the worst natural disaster in history wasn't natural at all.

This is a fascinating book, targeted at lawyers, but readable by the informed lay person.  Koppelman begins with an overview of Romer, in which the Supreme Court held that a Colorado state constitutional amendment violated the United States Constitution by providing that \\"neither the state nor any of its subdivisions could prohibit discrimination on the basis of homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships.\\" Justice Kennedy wrote that the Amendment \\"has the peculiar property of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group,\\" and Koppelman summarizes the decision as saying \\"if a law targets a narrowly defined group and then imposes on it disabilities that are so broad and undifferentiated as to bear no discernible relationship to any legitimate government interest then the court will infer that the law's purpose is simply to harm that group, and so will invalidate that law.\\" *<br /><br />He provides background on homophobia, quoting from a 1950 Senate committee investigation on the employment of homosexuals that \\"Even one sex pervert in Government tends to have a corrosive influence on his fellow employees... One homosexual can pollute a Government office.\\"<br /><br />He also points out that a recent study by the US Department of Justice found that homosexuals are \\"the most frequent victims [of hate violence today],\\" and public opinion polls show that homosexuals are the least liked group in America, with 28.2% giving homosexuals a zero ranking (on a scale of 0 to 100) with only 9% doing so for illegal immigrants and 2 percent doing so for Blacks.<br /><br />Some of the book is spent trying to reconcile Romer with Bowers v. Hardwick (1986) in which the Supreme Court held that a law criminalizing homosexual sodomy did not violate the Due Process Clause.  It is fascinating to see him struggle with Bowers when you know that his argument against this decision, which he characterizes as \\"a disastrously bad piece of judicial craftmanship,\\"  was to win the day only months after the book's publication in the Lawrence decision of 2003.<br /><br />The thrust of the book is to examine four arguments for gay rights in general and gay marriage in particular:<br /><br />The Equal Protection clause of the 14th amendment<br /><br />The Due Process clause of the 14th amendment<br /><br />The \\"Right to Privacy\\" arising out of Griswold and also Roe<br /><br />Sex discrimination<br /><br />In one fascinating section he shows how the Federal DOMA removes the full faith and credit assumption only from judgments in which the rendering court recognizes same-sex marriage but not in which the rendering court denies it. Thus,  in a hypothetical wrongful death case, if the defendant \\"filed a counterclaim for declaratory judgment and relitigated in the liability in a new forum, and that court held that no wrongful death suit could lie because no marriage ever existed, that judgment would be entiteled to full faith and credit everywhere, even in the state that recognizes same-sex marriage....If on the other hand the new forum state refused to collude in this evasion and confirmed the judgemetn,t he second judgment, too, would under DOMA not be entitled to full faith and credit, because that second judgment too would have recognized the existence of a same-sex marriage. The defendant would then be free to relitigate the question anew in a third forum and a fourth and so on. When at last he found a court that would cooperate with his scheme, the judgment issued by that forum would then be entitled to full faith and credit throughout the United States!\\"<br /><br />Koppelman's conclusion is that not only is the Federal DOMA unconstitutional, but it is so clearly targeted at homosexuals as a class that it strengthens the argument in favor of treating homosexuals as a suspect class, and thus laws against homosexuals are more suspect and held to a harder-to-defend standard. Thus, in the long run, he argues, DOMA will strengthen gay rights.us, in the long run, he argues, DOMA will strengthen gay rights.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-08

Written by the editorial page editor of the Rutland Herald (where he won a Pulitzer prize for his coverage of this issue) the book reads like a novel, filled with interesting characters and dramatic moments.<br /><br />Moats' thesis is that the Supreme Court in Vermont chose wisely not to mandate same-sex marriage but instead to remand the issue to the legislature. It is his theory that in the end, civil union was a preferable compromise to marriage for two reasons. First, the very process of having the legislature involved, complete with extensive public hearings, allowed many citizens to feel that they were heard and involved in the process. Second, and more important, the creation of civil unions avoided the intense backlash that might have been expected (and had been seen in Hawaii and other states) from a sweeping constitutional ruling mandating marriage.<br /><br />While I disagree with his conclusions about the advantages of civil unions, the book is fascinating to read and very well written, if a bit dated by recent events.	2004-11-08
US	53041309	RDZNII6OARG9	067401197X	15213451	Homosexuality and Civilization	Books	5	106	113	N	Y	Brilliant, incredilbly well researched history	While the book is highly academic and authoritative, it is also very accessible and enjoyable to read.  Here is a very brief summary:<br /><br />The book begins with a chapter on Early Greece (776-480 BCE). Crompton points to the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus (in the Iliad) as \\"exemplars of male love.\\"  He goes on to point out:<br />·  Greek poets sang of male love from almost the earliest fragments down to the end of classical time.<br />·  Mythology provides over 50 examples of homoerotic love, especially love by Gods of male youths<br />·  \\"Man-boy relations played a significant part in the social organization of such Dorian communities as Crete and Sparta\\"<br />·  In some Greek communities it was the boy's physical beauty that was desired, in others it was his character that was admired<br />·  In nearly every classical Greek community, the homosexual relationship between an older man and a younger boy was not only accepted, it was admired and held as a civic virtue and a bulwark against tyranny.<br />·  Man-boy love was used in many communities (e.g., Sparta) as a means of military training and indoctrination<br /><br />In the second chapter, on Judea, he points out that the early Jewish customs and laws were strongly opposed to homosexuality, though he does show that the destruction of Sodom was originally attributed to failure of the city to live up to its obligations of hospitality, and only much later (in Catholic teaching) was Sodom's destruction associated with homosexuality.<br /><br />The third chapter focuses on Classical Greece (480-323 BCE) and shows that here too, Homosexuality and bisexuality were not only considered perfectly natural, but were acclaimed at every level of society.  Many Greek writers, playwrights and philosophers not only practiced homosexuality and pederasty, they praised it and held it up as an ideal. Plato was a notable exception who held boy-love as an ideal as long as it was not consummated.<br /><br />In Thebes, a general argued that pairs of man/boy lovers would make great warriors because they would fight for one another's safety and would fear cowardice in the eyes of their beloved. He created the \\"Sacred Band of Thebes\\" which became the most powerful army on earth, and which made Thebes the greatest military power.<br /><br />Chapter 4 turns to Rome, where homosexuality was more constrained: it was considered fine to have homosexual sex with a slave so long as the free man was dominant, but it was shameful to have homosexual sex with a free born person or as the passive partner.  Crompton notes that homosexuality was seen as part of the \\"will to power\\" and a type of dominance. He also notes that the famous Roman poet Ovid wrote many homoerotic poems, though he decried Lesbianism as unacceptable.<br /><br />Chapter 5 turns to the early Christians, and here everything changes. While homosexuality was not a central issue in early Christianity, Paul's Epistle to the Romans began 2000 years of virulent prejudice against homosexuality.<br /><br />Clement of Alexandria created the \\"Alexandrian rule\\" which held that \\"pleasure sought for its own sake, even within marriage, is a sin...\\"  He also held that it is a sin for men to shave.<br /><br />For the first two centuries of Christianity, however, Roman custom continued to accept homosexuality, and Plutarch wrote that the \\"mortal reflections of the divine [derive from] young men radiant in the prime of their beauty.\\"<br /><br />Beginning with Constantine, however, Roman law changed, and became much harsher in its persecution of homosexuals. It was around this time (390 CE) that the understanding of the story of Sodom changed and in the City of God Augustine described Sodom's destruction as a result of homosexuality among the populace.<br /><br /> Saint John Chrysostom \\"ranks as the most influential of (Christian) Greek fathers, second only to Augustine\\" and he instituted organized persecution of homosexuals as a Christianobligation. He denounced male love as \\"monstrous, Satanical, detestable, execrable and pitiable.\\" (He also denounced Jews as \\"sensual, slippery, voluptuous, avaricious, possessed by demons, drunkards, harlots and breakers of the law.\\")<br /><br /> Chapters six and seven focuses on the medieval period  Throughout this period homosexuals were persecuted and murdered relentlessly in Christendom. Medieval Islam, however, held a more ambivalent attitude. Like Judaism and Christianity, it prohibited homosexuality, but Moslem cultures were pervaded by homoerotic poetry and art. Nonetheless, the theologian Malik of Median whose \\"school of jurisprudence became the dominant one in Spain and North Africa, endorsed the death penalty\\" for homosexuality. Crompton states, \\"Muslim religion paradoxically forbade, allowed and exalted homoerotic desire... sexual contact was forbidden, but the man who admitted to love for another male might still be respected.\\"<br /><br /> St. Aquinas endorsed Augistine's opinion that homosexuality is the \\"worst\\" of sexual sins, and specifically stated that consensual homosexuality is worse than the rape of a woman (because such rape might lead to procreation). By the same logic, he held that masturbation was worse than rape, because of the loss of the seed.<br /><br />France at this time began to consign homosexuals to the flames and mutilation was common. English law was severe but not as barbaric as France or Spain.<br /><br />Chapter 8 turns to Imperial China (500 BCE to 1849 CE).  Crompton shows that homosexuality was a central aspect of Chinese culture for nearly 2,000 years.<br /><br />He traces canonical anecdotes about homosexual love through Chinese history, and tells three famous anecdotes (the story of the peach, the story of Lord Yang and the story of the cut sleeve).

Each chapter consists of two essays (one in favor of same-sex marriage and one against). Each essay is followed by a brief rebuttal (usually by the author of the opposing essay).<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts. The first part is Comparative Historical and Family Policy Perspectives and has essays by Evan Woflsen, Maggie Gallagher, Mark Strasser and other well-known advocates on both sides of the issue.<br /><br />Part II is Issues of Jurisprudence and Political Philosophy and has essays by legal scholars on the legal theories behind enabling or prohibiting same-sex marriages.<br /><br />The third and final part is on Constitutional Law and has arguments by some of the leading constitutional scholars on this issue.<br /><br />The book manages to be approachable by the lay reader, but is a serious work and takes a bit of concentrated effort to work through all the arguments.  It is a terrific attempt at making the case on all the various sides and aspects of the issue.  Well worth the time.	2004-10-30
