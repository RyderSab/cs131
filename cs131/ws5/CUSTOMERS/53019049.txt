It helps with the main missions well enough, but I constantly found myself searching through the guide to see where I currently was. The game allows quite a bit of freedom in how to move around the world (city), and this guide obviously had difficulties organizing its content around that.<br /><br />However, I did find the overall guide helpful. Especially the overview and introduction chapters got me in the right mindset to approach most of the game on my own.	2005-07-24

Especially the initial part is helpful in getting started in the game and finding your way around. It provides a good overview of the different types of characters you can play and provides some guidance in possible ways of developing these characters and how to use the character's skills.<br /><br />The second part of the book is a plain walk through. This becomes a cheat-sheet more than anything else. You can probably find this on the Internet. I would have wished for more overall strategy.	2005-04-09

Kept me reading through it fairly quickly. The whole story is intriguing enough, although it does start out a bit slow IMO. McDevitt also manages to stay away from one of my common problems with his books, which is that they are entertaining, but not plausible at all. This one just is a lot more believable (for a scifi book), and unlikely coincidences occur a lot less often.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to scifi fans, but do not expect it to be the best you've ever read.	2005-04-01

It is well done, covers a lot of ground, and explains a few details and tricks that you might now know otherwise.<br /><br />However, the game itself is not that complicated. I would argue that there is not much of a reason to buy a strategy guide for a game this straightforward. It is a bit of a shame, because this book isn't bad (perhaps even better than a 4-star review would suggest), but there just isn't much need for it.	2005-03-28

Funny at times. Interesting in all cases. Personally, I always considered myself much more comfortable with numbers than most people, while at the same time understanding that I still only understood a very small part of mathematical knowledge available. Reading this book, I realized that although I didn't fall into all the math-traps other people seem to fall into, I still were way off when it came to understanding certain every day numbers.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone. It is not hard to read as one would expect a math book to be.	2005-03-26

It is not a strategy guide as much as it is a manual. The chapters it has on battle maps and campaign maps brovide little information that isn't available in the game's manual. The strategy guide does have a nice catalog of all units and buildings, which is helpful.<br /><br />I had hoped this guide would provide a lot of information on how to play the game and get through certain situations. It is nice to know what a certain unit does and what its exact statistics are, but before I am interested in that, I would like some basic information on how to fight a battle. Knowing that fire arrows make the ememy peer their pants is interesting, but it would be nice to know when to use them, when not to use them, how accurate they are compared to regular arrows and such.<br /><br />There are many examples that need explaining on the campaign map too. What can I do to make sure my family tree grows? If I do not have enough family members to put a governor in every town and a general in every army, is it better to have towns without governors or armies without a leader?<br /><br />None of these questions are answered here. The closest this guide comes to really guiding the reader is in the section about historical battles (although those chapters are very short). Overall, I recommend you go to [...] and ignore this guide.	2004-11-26

It is over 300 pages thick with detailed information about every location. It covers Half Life 2 as well as Counter Strike - Source. The entire guide is in full color and printed on heavy paper.<br /><br />In addition to explaining gameplay details, the guide also covers some basic information that would normally be in a manual. Since HL2 does not come with a manual, this is very nice. It is not something I would normally expect from a strategy guide, but I appreciate that they went the extra mile there.<br /><br />This is also the kind of game that makes a strategy guide important. HL2 is not a mindless shooter, so you are likely to get stuck at some point. This guide is a great tool and will help you out when you need it.<br /><br />Note that this guide is not the same is the \\"Official Hint Book\\" that ships with the collector's edition. In fact, the booklet that ships with the collector's edition is really just an advertisement for this book. Get the real thing and ignore the collector's edition.	2004-11-24

Not too many pages, but tells you just about everything there is to know about this game. All the missions are explained and all the choices you make too. I found this very helpful since I could make a choice and then go back to the guide to see whether it was worth replaying the game with a different choice or whether the experience would not be altered very much. This guide also explains a bunch of stuff the manual does not talk about.<br /><br />This guide is also great for players who have not played Deus Ex 1 and still want to enjoy the story.	2004-11-20

I wish it had a bit more detail in terms of multi-player and skirmish strategies. A lot of this guide focuses in the campaign. Normally, that would be OK, but since the campaign in this game is so short and basically a no-brainer, I would have appreciated more skirmish and multi-player info.<br /><br />None of that is the author's fault however. It just results in a strategy guide that is OK, but not crucial. Buy it if you really like to play the game and plan to play it a lot. Otherwise, you can probably do without this guide.	2004-11-14

I mainly used this guide to familiarize myself with the game mechanics and details. That part of the book is pretty well done, although it could have been organized a bit better.<br />Further down the road, I found this book to be more of a cheat-sheet, than a true strategy guide. I read the book after I finished certain parts of the game to make sure I wasn't missing any side quests. Beyond that, I only found it to be of limited use throughout the quests, because reading it would ruin your game experience. Of course, if you really got stuck, it might be helpful, but that didn't happen to me.<br />The stats part is a bit disappointing. I didn't find it to be too useful. Overall, I would have wanted a bit more help with the overal game strategy. How do I go about making my light sabre most powerful? Not sure. It's as easy or hard without the book as it is with it.	2004-05-22
US	53019049	R30BCEDUYXDNEN	1861007477	3175553	Visual Basic .NET Code Security Handbook	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Quick read, yet very valuable	I found this to be one of the better Wrox books I have read in quite some time. Many of the topics discussed in this book should be common knowledge in the .NET world, but I can guarantee they are not. In fact, I cently was involved in a panel discussion at a popular developer conference, and then the panelists asked the audience who used code access security, not a single hand was raised.<br />This book covers many .Net security topics very well. It is intended as a handbook, and its size keeps the focus somewhat narrow. For this reason, every serious developer should have more security literature than just this book. On the other hand, if every developer just set aside the few hours it takes to read this book, then we would have much more secure software.<br />Bottom line: Great book that does exactly what it set out to do. However, reading additional security books such as Writing Solid Code as well as other .NET specific security books is highly recommended.	2004-05-22

The book does a good job at making a point through examples and by explaining possible exploits.<br />This book tries to cover a lot of ground. Most of the things discussed are for C++ developers. However, most of the things discussed are of general interest no matter what language one develops with.<br />I found myself wishing that the book covered a bit more about my development environment of choice: Visual Studio .NET. As mentioned above, I found all the content very interesting and applicable, but I think it would be good to have more than one chapter covering .NET specifically. I do realize however, that this book was first written before .NET. Perhaps someone will dedicate a book completely to .NET (&quot;Writing Secure .NET Code&quot; anyone?).<br />This book provides a solid foundation and teaches developers what to look for. However, the book is written for developers and managers alike and does not cover tons of implementation details. I would recommend this book to everyone as a first book to read about secure application development. It is not the last book people should read however. There are a number of good books available for a variety of environments (including .NET) that discuss specific implementations of various security and privacy techniques. Get several of those books as well!<br />Bottom line: This is a great book. Developers must read it. No &quot;ifs&quot; and &quot;buts&quot;. Once you are done with this one though, get other security books and keep on reading...	2004-05-04

It moves fast and may give people who are not familiar with Visual Studio .NET a hard time keeping up. But this is what I really liked about this book! You want to learn how to program? Find a different book! You want to get into DirectX development? Look no further!<br />Just the first chapter explains more than practically any other book about Managed DirectX I have read. Sure, it doesn't have all the long and ellaborate explanations some of the other books have. But for some reason, I still felt like a had a better understanding of how to do things the 'right way' after reading this book. This may have to do with the fact that the author of the book is also the author of the API.<br />The book covers a lot of ground. Most of the chapters deal with Direct3D (which is what I was interested in), although the author does touch on other subjects such as DirectInput. The pace is fast and the author covers the whole range from primitive drawing techniques to using higher level concepts, such as meshes, and eve the HLSL (high level shader language), which many would consider an advanced topic. Well, I do anyway...  ;-)<br />The book doesn't just provide shallow introductions. In fact, the author doesn't even shy away from topics such as skeletal anomation of meshes, or writing pixel and vertex shaders to create specular highlights and per-pixel lighting effects.<br />Well done! This book will explain a lot, and it does so quickly. However, if you have no experience with 3d graphics at all, you may want to follow up with another book, such as 'Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DX9' by Frank D. Luna, which will give you a good understanding of related topics, such as a lot of the underlying math used for matrix transformation and vector mechanics. This can be done as a second step though, since this book does not require knowledge of these things, as it uses functions provided by the Managed API for practically everything it does.<br />As we are starting do work more with 3d graphics as a company, I have a need to get team members up to speed on the subject matter. This is the book I recommended they all read...everything it does.<br />As we are starting do work more with 3d graphics as a company, I have a need to get team members up to speed on the subject matter.

Of course, the game is somewhat open ended within each mission. I often found myself going different routes than the guide suggests, but even then, the suggestions made by the book are valuable.<br />Note that this covers both the base game and the expansion, which makes it a good value. Unless you already had the book for the base game... ;-)	2004-03-21

It is a good introduction for people who know how to program, but have not done any Direct3D development before. The book is written in a very straightforward and almost scientific manner. This book does not assume the reader to be a complete beginner when it comes to many programming topics like so many other DX9 books do (even though they often claim they don't).<br />This book simply covers the fundamental Direct3D topics as well as a bit of math, and it does so from the ground up as far as the DX API goes. Most of the samples are done soup to nuts, rather than using helper methods and API sample code that simplifies things a lot, but keeps too many details from the reader (once again: like so many other DX9 books seem to do).<br />I like the focus of the book: It simply only describes Direct 3D graphics programming. Other DirectX topics, such as DirectPlay or DirectInput are NOT covered. Also, if you do not know what a game-loop is, then you won't learn it here. I think this is one of the things I like most about this book: It focuses on one topic, and it does a great job at that!<br />But a small warning is in order as well: If you are not an experienced programmer and just want to get started with game development, then this book is NOT for you! Quite simply, many aspects of 3d graphics development are not for the faint of heart! Don't expect this book to read like a novel either. It is very much a DX9 text book.	2004-03-07

The first half of the book is full of information about the 2003 Iraq war. If you have followed the vents closely, you will not find much new here, although some additional insight from an insiders point of view is provided.<br />Personally, I liked the second part of the book better, because it told me about General Clark and his opinions. Contrary to one of my fellow reviewers, I found his viewpoints to be surprisingly civillian for a military man of his rank.<br />If you are wondering whether Wes Clark would make for a good president, this book can help to shape your opinion (one way or the other). I would def. recommend reading it.	2003-11-15

It is very easy to read although the subjects discussed aren't really trivial. The book touches on a wide array of topics, ranging from GDI+ to DirectInput and DirectAudio, as well as DirectDraw.<br />However, the potential buyer should be aware that this is a very basic book. If you want to write the next Doom, this book will not teach you how to do that. In fact, considering that this book has &quot;DirectX&quot; in the title, it covers very little 3D programming. However, this book DOES teach the basics of game development and almost all aspects that go along with that, from simple graphics to controlling sound, and controllers such as force feedback joysticks. But as I said: Most of it is pretty basic. But if you have no experience with game development whatsoever, reading this book will be an excellent first step...	2003-07-20

This is an excellent book. It does a very good job explaining the machanics of a very complex game.<br />It is also a very well done book. Almost the entire book is in full color.<br />Note that this book describes a huge game world that is evolving. No doubt some of it will become outdated, and some of it might already be. But the fundamentals described here are very good and will help every player. Also, the book can not describe everything, despite the fact that it is already thicker than any other strategy guide I own. I still think that this is an excellent book that every serious player should get.	2003-07-14

The information provided in this area is excellent.<br />Personally, I was hoping for a bit more basic racing information. There really is only one chapter that tells the racer how to go around turns the fastest, how to pass, and how to fight for position. This section is very short, and the descriptions there are not as clear as in the sections about mechanics. A few more illustrations would have been very helpful here.<br />Of course the fact that I personally hoped for more racing information and less mechanics doesn't make this a bad book. Quite the contrary, actually.	2003-06-28

There are sections such as &quot;Desserts&quot; and &quot;Canyons&quot;. When I went to Arizona the last time, I wanted to visit desserts, and I wanted to hike some Canyons, so I could simply read these sections and learn pretty much everything I wanted to know, rather than piece this information together as other travel books make you do (since they are usually organized by area). The organization also allows you to skip information such as &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;History&quot;. Of course in the end I ended up being interested in these sections after all, so I read them in the care while I was there. And once again, I could focus on these sections rather than finding this information organized by area.<br />Long story short: I really like reading about an area by topic of interest, rather than by location. It makes travel planning much easier. Of course, your need may be different (you may be in a certain town and want to figure out what to do for instance...). In that case, this book still is useful (it DOES have short sections on individual locations), but there are other books I use for that type of research.<br />Overall, I can highly recommend this book. In fact, I will order some of the other books from this series for different states.	2003-06-21

(Or even any other .NET language as the examples really aren't that hard to translate...). The book is well organized and readable and guides the reader through all the aspects of writing the typical Tablet PC application.<br />Of course, this whole subject is extensive, and the book can not discuss it all. For advanced topics such as writing ink recognizers from scratch, you will have to find another source. But I really wouldn't expect a book like this to cover all the advanced topics.<br />Note that this book does NOT cover COM-based or non-managed (non .NET) APIs.

This book is pretty good and will be helpful for every Sim City 4 player. It explains many overall strategies, and gives valuable tips.<br />Unfortunately, the book could have been much better. The game itself doesn't have a real manual, leaving the player wondering about the most basic game mechanics. While it shouldn't be up to a strategy guide to explain these things, it would have been a great oportunity for the authors of this book to provide that type of information, which would have made this book a must-buy.<br />Without that information, this book is a good resource for people who are serious about this game and have already figured out the basics through trial and error.<br />Overall I am glad I bought this book.	2003-03-23

However, I sometimes found myself wishing for more detail, especially on some of the maps. There are many things that happen off the in-game map and I would have liked to have seen those. This is especially true for things such as the race track that doesn't have a map at all. Sure, the map isn't in the game and they couldn't have just taken it from there, but hey, for things I can get straight out of the game, I do not have to buy a book for!<br />Overall, this is a pretty good book, and if I could, I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars. But it's just not quite a 5.	2003-01-12

If you like to tour the country mostly in larger tour groups, you will probably not need this book. However, if you like to rent a car and visit a number of sites, this will be very helpful. It gave us great guidance for anything from archeological sites to cave diving.	2003-01-03

Just when you thing &quot;two more pages and I will stop reading at the end of the chapter...&quot;, something happens that keeps you from keeping the book down.<br />Just like other McDevitt stories I read however, it again is not truely believable. Of course, this is a science fiction novel, and those tend to be less believable, but I actually am talking more about the details. All the scientists in McDevitt's books always seem to practice what I would call &quot;cowboy science&quot;.<br />However, if you can overlook that for a great story, you will have a lot of fun with this one...	2003-01-02
US	53019049	R1YAYMFKT8HE9I	0441009387	80979198	Chindi	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Very Entertaining although somewhat constructed	This is a great scifi story. Very entertaining, and a true page turner. When I finally finished it, it kept me up until 5am.<br />The story is pretty well laid out and makes sense within the world constructed by McDevitt. However, there are some limitations as far as how &quot;realistic&quot; it is. People too easily take risks and enter alien worlds as casually as one would enter the public library.<br />However, McDevitt sticks to the world he creates and is fairly consistant within it, which (if you can accept its &quot;cowboy&quot; nature), makes for an entertaining story.<br />If you like scifi, you should enjoy this one!	2002-11-09

However, I would have expected this book to give me a good overview over all threading aspects and provide at least a starting point for further investigation.<br />While I recognize the fact that a book of this size can't cover everything, I was still disappointed about coverage of fairly basic subjects, such as making Windows Forms thread-safe. I am also disappointed in the coverage about the thread-pool for instance.<br />Overall, a nice book, but there are a number of books that have a single chapter devoted to threading, yet cover more ground in that area...	2002-10-05

This is the kind of book you want to read when you want to get started with GDI+ development, and custom controls in particular. Yes, there are a lot of things that are not explained, but they, GDI+ and custom control development is a huge topic and couldn't possibly be covered in one book! The information provided in this book is excellent. It covers the basics of GDI+, custom control development, printing, and even web related stuff you may not think of at first. What's missing is how to build input-oriented controls, such as as fancy grids or spreadsheets and other advanced topics. But then again, I wouldn't expect a book like this to cover these topics.	2002-09-19
US	53019049	R8WC3ONXXIWVC	0735615330	104257456	McAd/MCSD Self-Paced Training Kit	Books	2	7	8	N	N	Good concept, too sloppy, too many errors	The concept of this book is great, but execution is too sloppy. After reading through the first few pages, I discovered a number of errors in the sample code.<br />Even the sample chapter posted on the MS Press web page is wrong! According to the sample chapter, a form's Activate() method is called Activate() in VB.NET, and Active() in C#. Rubbish! And this is in the very paragraph that explains Activate(), and the two samples are two lines appart! It hurts when you look at the thing!<br />Another example is the section that explains how to return a value from a method. Can anyone explain to me how the following code would ever return a value?:<br />public int Add(int first, int second)<br />{<br />  int Result;<br />  Result = first + second;<br />}<br />This raises a compiler error immediately for the very reason that no value is returned! And that's in the example that explains how to return values!!! The VB.NET sample has the same probem.<br />Or has anyone ever seen a variable declaration like this in VB.NET:<br />Dim x,y integer<br />Hello?!? If they at least would have typed this into the VB editor it would have immediately been flagged as wrong (AS keyword, anyone?)!<br />Bottom line, this book explains a lot of good things, but the code samples are too sloppy. People that don't know this stuff already will be confused at best. People that DO know this stuff don't have much of a reason to read this.<br />In all fairness, I have to admit that this book does cover things I didn't know before (hence two stars instead of one), and if you feel comfortable that you can straighten out the code samples on your own, you might get some value out of this.<br />At the end of the day, I am not going to give this book to my employees to learn. It simply isn't a good vehicle for that purpose. And quite frankly: For the price of this, I would have expected it to be!	2002-09-12

At the same time, it is easy and entertaining to read.

It gets much better from then on though! I def. wasn't able to put the book down for the last 200 pages and ended up staying awake until 4:30am to see how it all ended!<br />In the end, things get pretty wild. I'm not sure how realistic it is (I'm not saying it isn't...), but one thing is for sure: This is one entertaining story!	2001-11-11

However, the reader who is familiar with the general software development lifecycle (such as the unified software development process) won't find much new information in this book. I was a little disappointed about the amount of project management specific information.	2001-06-02

I saw that other people made some comments about the XSL not being mentioned all too often in this book. That's true. But this book goes way beyond XSL and that is important, because XML is more than converting XML  into HTML.<br />I can recommend this book to everybody who wants to understand  XML quickly. This book guides you from the basics to advanced topics such  as the DTD in a clear and straightforward manner.	1999-04-28
