According to the Internet poll used to determine who to include, the most influential and popular leaders of Russia include: Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian Federation; Alexei II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church; Yuri Luzhkov, Mayor of Moscow; Sergey Yastrzhembsky, senior advisor to the President; Sergei Ivanov, Minister of Defence; Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party; Mikhail Shvydkoy, head of the Federal Agency of Culture and Cinematography; and Irina Khakamada, candidate in the 2004 Presidential election.

The exhibition took place in Moscow in October, 2004 at the State Tretyakov Gallery and will travel in February 2005 to the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg. This catalogue and the show is important both to the art world and to the Russian art scene, as it will re-introduce Oleg Vassiliev's works in their entire scope to art collectors and admirers, as well as to a new generation of Russians who grew up in the post-perestroika era. <br /> <br />Oleg Vassiliev was born in 1931 in Moscow and now lives and works in New York. From 1947 to 1952, he studied at art school, and in 1958 he graduated from the V.I. Surikov State Art Institute, Moscow, where he specialized in graphic art. From the 1950s to the 1980s Oleg Vassiliev, together with Eric Bulatov, illustrated children's books as a team for thirty-three years. Time not spent on book illustrating - approximately six months a year - was devoted to creative work for themselves. In the 1960s, Vassiliev investigated painting itself as an instrument to explore its space, its relationship to surface and border, the energy flow in the picture, and the transformation of subject and space, using Favorsky's system as the basis, as well as the interactions of the surface-space in the canvas. Vassiliev's principal themes, which were born while he was in Russia and continue to the present day, are his memories of home and houses, roads, forests, fields, friends and family. <br /> <br />\\"Oleg Vassiliev: Memory Speaks (Themes and Variations)\\" is a journey of intellectual and creative exploration of the artist's career from 1949 to the present day. \\"Memory Speaks\\" in the title is an allusion to Vladimir Nabokov's \\"Speak, Memory\\"; literary references are important for understanding Vassiliev's work and psyche.	2004-12-18

Selections from the Kolodzei Collection of Russian and Eastern European Art (1960 - 2000) (English and Italian Edition)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Remarkable Collection, A Marvelous Catalogue	The most remarkable thing about the Kolodzei Collection of Russian and Eastern European Art is its holdings-over 7,000 pieces by over 300 artists.  Few collectors in any time have attempted to build such a massive chronicle of art of a particular period.  What makes the Kolodzei Collection unique in art history, though, is the time of its birth:  the height of Cold War communism.   <br /> <br />Tatiana Kolodzei was the \\"Peggy Guggenheim\\" of the Russian Art World in the 1960s-1980s.  Few people besides Tatiana had the courage to seek out artworks which didn't conform to the accepted standards of the time.  Unlike, say, the controversy surrounding NEA funding in the 1990's in the United States, the stakes weren't just over a stipend-there were very real risks, dangers, involved in chronicling the art of this era. <br /> <br />When one thinks of Russian art, they tend to think that it stopped in 1934, when \\"Socialist Realism\\" was the official (and usually the only acceptable) style.  But especially after the death of Stalin in 1953 there emerged so-called \\"Non-conformist\\" art, art outside the academic standards of the time, often produced by artists trained in traditions but like their Western counterparts.  There existed a parallel art world in Russia and the former Soviet Union to the movements that were practiced in the West, a world that was quite unique. <br /> <br />Just as George Costakis helped keep the art of the Russian Avant-Garde alive through his collecting, his protg, Tatiana Kolodzei (and since the 1980s her daughter, Natalia) has given a gift to the world in the form of her collection and the treasures of Russian art found within.	2004-09-05

Previous attempts at establishing a constitutional democracy include the 1825 Decembrists' revolt, the Manifest of 1905 which granted to the population basic civil rights, and the Fundamental Laws of the State of 1906. In 1924, after the formation of the Soviet Union, the first Constitution of the USSR was adopted. In 1936 the Stalin Constitution took effect. In 1977 the Brezhnev Constitution became law. These documents all granted great freedoms to the individual, but were mere words on paper. The Brezhnev Constitution was in effect until the adaptation of the Constitution of the Russian Federation in 1993.  <br /> <br />One hundred thirty-seven different illustrations, each an artistic interpretation of the 137 Articles of the post-Soviet Constitution of 1993, honor the Constitution's 10th Anniversary.. More than 100 artists of different generations, from the post-Stalin \\"Thaw\\" years to the present, democratic times, participated in Art Constitution: The Illustrated Constitution of the Russian Federation, the project of Ivan Kolesnikov, Sergei Denisov, and Petr Vois, along with Zurab Tsereteli (President of the Russian Academy of Arts, Director of the Moscow Modern Art Museum, and distinguished sculptor) and Natalia Kolodzei (Executive Director of the Kolodzei Art Foundation and co-owner of one of the world's largest private art collections). The project, comprised entirely of works from the last 10 years, enables the spectator to trace the evolution and view the complete spectrum of contemporary Russian art through the illustration of each of the Constitution's Articles. <br /> <br />Artists' participation in the political life of Russia has a long history. One of the most vivid examples is the brief history of the relationship of the Russian Avant-Garde and the printed word, when the graphic arts were considered an integral part of visual art. Despite utopian ideas and anarchical moods, books of pre-1914 were designed for a narrow circle of people and had no great political effect. With the Revolution in 1917, when the former counterculture for a short time became recognized as the official cultural elite, utopian ideas in the works by Alexandre Rodchenko, El Lissitzky, and Gustav Klucis turned into concrete form. Now approached as ideological tools, books became graphically more logical and symmetrical. <br /> <br />After the death of Lenin in 1924 and the emergence of the Stalin dictatorship, diversity in graphic design and illustration diminished. The Communist Party, by then the only arbitrator of culture, called for an art \\"comprehensible to the millions.\\" Abstraction was disfavored, and, to eliminate traces of personal touch in a collective art, photography became the prescribed source for images. In the hands of artists like Lissitzky, Klucis, Rodchenko, and Varvara Stepanova it was put to brilliant use. Lissitzky even managed to give Stalinist propaganda some flair: the subject of his 1934 photomontage of Red Army maneuvers is chilling, but it is hard not to admire its striking design. The very year Lissitzky produced this work, Socialist Realist was decreed the only acceptable aesthetic style. Some artists complied, others fled to Europe, while many vanished in government purges. The Russian Avant-Garde was finished, and with it the thrilling tradition of artist's books had come to a halt.  <br /> <br />The First Illustrated Constitution of the Russian Federation unites living artists who began their careers during Khrushchev's Thaw and the artists who started their careers in the post-Soviet period, all of whom now enjoy the benefit and challenge of artistic freedom in the new Russia. It is important to note the individuality of each work, and of each artist, incorporated in one project. Photographs by Vlad Mamyshev-Monro, Tatiana Antoshina, and Oleg Kulik, constructivist design and photomontages by Sergei Denisov and Ivan Kolesnikov, SotsArt allusions by Boris Orlov, an illustration in neo-primitivist style by Andrei Karpov, Andrei Bilzho's comics, conceptual projects by Farid Bogdalov, Komar & Melamid -- almost all the artistic trends and movements of the second half of the 20th century are represented. These 137 illustrations represent different aspects of the Russian art and views of the Russian life.  <br /> <br />It is important to note that such a project as this is possible in Russia only since the adaptation of the 1993 Constitution, when the artist freely and, ironically, sometimes very sharply, can create their own illustrations. Juxtaposition of an illustration on one page facing a page with its associated Article creates a special atmosphere - a new way of reading. By participation in this project, the artist, a citizen of the Russian Federation, reflects on the past ten years of the existence (and the implications) of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, thinking back to the optimism embodied by this document and forward to the realities (both good and bad) of present-day society.	2004-09-02

Russia is like a Faberg egg-a beautiful exterior with a hard-to-open but spectacular hidden interior.  Among the little known gems in St. Petersburg are the Museum of Theatrical and Musical Arts, the Nabokov Museum (former residence of Vladimir Nabokov), the Russian Ethnographic Museum, the Rimskii-Korsakov Memorial Apartment-Museum, the History of Religion Museum (formerly the \\"Anti-Religion Museum), the recently-opened Museum of Toys, and the Museum of Russian Vodka.  All these treasures and more are fondly catalogued in Cathy Giangrande's Saint Petersburg: Museums Palaces and Historic Collections (Museums).      To appreciate this book a traveler needs to understand the unintentional irony of the chapter titled \\"Also well worth a visit are ...\\" listing the Hermitage Museum, one of the world's premier cultural treasures (and the most popular tourist site in Russia).  It makes a great companion to such guides as DK Eyewitness's St. Petersburg guidebook (far more sights and coverage of the Hermitage, but without lengthy descriptions of lesser-known museums).      Its small size makes this a \\"laptray book\\", but for the visitor in body or spirit to St. Petersburg is just as enthralling as a five pound coffee table book. One-to-four pages are devoted to each of the over 40 lesser known attractions in St. Petersburg. Each listing had a clear address, directions, phone and web site (if available).      Books like this will help St. Petersburg, and Russia, become one of the world's premier tourist destinations in the next 10 years.  There are literally thousands of such treasures throughout Russia as these listed here, but few people know about them.  Truly, this book will help anyone interested in truly discovering Russia.	2004-09-02

His book captures something of the atmosphere of Moscow and the former Soviet Union of the 1990s when anything seemed possible in the world of finance, set in a time and place in which Berezovsky, Gusinsky, and Potanin were discussed with the same awe (and envy) as Bezos, Case and (Martha) Stewart were in the United States.    One tale of a board meeting in the mid-1990s in the chapter \\"Potemkin Inc.\\" (after the phrase \\"Potemkin village\\", a sham devised by 18th century bureaucrats to impress their sovereign) is particularly telling, not only about how far corporate governance has to go to attract foreign investors but also how the 'Soviet' mentality continues:      \\"One by one, the nine board members followed, one elderly official pausing by the microphone.  'Foreigners need to think about the future of the plant and about the welfare of its employees, not just about pumping profits,' he spat, white with anger.  'This meeting is over,' he added, storming off the stage.\\"    Such comments have a familiar tone to consumers of Soviet propaganda.  For 70 years the Soviet Union spoke of the horrors of Western imperialism, while at the same time running the most far-reaching totalitarian empire the world has ever seen.      At times Casino Moscow veers too much between being a personal memoir of his time in Moscow along with his growing relationship with Roberta and the larger story of the first few years of freedom in Russia.  Snippets of the life of an expat in Moscow-the problems with personal staff, fears about safety, frustration with the petty bureaucracy-leave the reader wanting to learn more about what it is like to be in a country that has collapsed and is trying to find its place in the world community.  Although I can sympathize with the desire for maintaining discretion regarding his wife's career, it was somewhat teasing that Brzezinski doesn't name her shadowy (although well known in Russian finance circles) and immensely profitable employer; he writes,  \\"...I have taken the liberty of changing [her firm's name] to VSO, for Very Secretive Organization.\\"  Such subterfuge does little to dispel the notion of a cabal of financiers plotting the future of the world behind the scenes (which does not make Western capital look too attractive to its recipients).    Casino Moscow is an enjoyable book to read for anyone wondering about the beginnings of Russia's post-Soviet history.	2004-08-28

It is a good visual and historic guide to St Petersburg,      We call \\"St. Petersburg Eyewitness Travel Guide\\" the \\"St. Petersburg for Dummies\\" as it is designed to be browsed.  The thumbnail-sized color photographs will inspire you to read a bit more about the attractions, so it is ideal to review before the trip, as well as during the first meeting with a local tour guide (\\"Gee, this building looks interesting, how do I see it?\\").  Most of our clients read the book before going, and put Post-It notes on pages with interesting attractions to ask about.      \\"St. Petersburg Eyewitness Travel Guide\\" is also ideal for the cruise ship visitors who will be in St. Petersburg for less than three days, as the photos give a good appreciation to the visitor of what there is to see, especially in a limited amount of time.     The history and art sections are reasonably good for a guide book.  The restaurant and hotel suggestions are accurate (as far as quality and general pricing range, although the pricing itself is not accurate)..    Note, however, that we always tell clients and other visitors to Russia that you should get the most current guidebook, as attractions, hotels, restaurants and transportation options do often change--AND THEN VERIFY THE INFORMATION!  All in all, we recommend \\"St. Petersburg Eyewitness Travel Guide\\" as the first guidebook to purchase when planning on journey of Discovering Russia's second city, St. Petersburg.

Useful for anyone looking to understand how art is inspired by the historical climate of a period, in this case climaxing in a burst of optimism and energy after the end of Tsarist rule.	2002-03-23

The Museum of Modern Art in New York had an exhibition in 1998 devoted to their works; the catalogue, 'Aleksandr Rodchenko', is a well presented overview that is ideal for those wanting to learn about the art and politics of post-revolutionary Russia.	2002-03-23

(Priviet, spaciba, pazhulsta)<br />There are many language guides, dictionaries, phrase books and the like, but the 'Eyewitness Travel Phrase Book: Russian' book is a convenient format (fits easily into the back pants pocket) and has a good layout of necessary survival phrases so you can quickly ask &quot;Gdye too-alyet?&quot; (Where is the bathroom?) or &quot;Vi gavareet-ye pa-angleeksee?&quot; (Do you speak English?).	2002-03-22

Although it is starting to age (published in 1998) it is a good visual and historic guide to Moscow, with enough color photographs to both inspire and guide you.  <br />As other reviewers have noted, this book is ideal to use to review with a tour guide the sights and areas that you want to see because of its diagrams, pictures and suggested itineraries.  <br />The history and art sections are reasonably good for a guide book.<br />The restaurant and hotel suggestions are a bit stale, and the pricing is out of date (although the range of pricing is still reasonably accurate).	2002-03-22

There are almost no current guidebooks to regions such as Perm, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Volgograd, Crimea, Minsk, and the Far East. The 'Lonely Planet Russia, Ukraine &amp; Belarus (Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, 2Nded)' has the largest area coverage of any guide currently published in English.  <br />It is also ideal for those taking a river cruise between Moscow and St. Petersburg.<br />The coverage of the famed Trans-Siberian route is ok, although I think the 'Trans-Siberian Handbook' and 'Siberian Bam Guide : Rail, Rivers &amp; Road' do a better job for those particular regions.<br />The Moscow/St. Petersburg sections are ok as well, although I think anyone spending more than a few days in each of those cities should look into guides that cover only those cities.<br />Restaurant, hotel and travel information are good, although could use more details.  The history sections are adequate considering the scope of the book.  Also, the twice-yearly updates at Lonely Planet's web site, although lacking in breadth and depth, provide some more timely information than what appears in the book.	2002-03-22
