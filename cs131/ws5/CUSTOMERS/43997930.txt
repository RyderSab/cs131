A man, who after supposedly killing a man, retreated into the mountains and now is a matter of local legend. She went in search of him, but after getting hurt, was saved by the wild man himself. After some awkward moments, natural for a man not being around a woman for fifteen years, the inevitable happened. I actually liked Jarred more than I did Victoria. I thought Victoria often came across as being rather sanctomonious and full of her own sensible nature, yet she would one moment want to find and tame 'the wild man', and the next flee from him thinking he was a beast. She'd want to be practical in the cave with him, and try to get him to be sensible too, then want to avoid the issue when she didn't want to deal with it. She just annoyed me. Jarred had a innocent quality to him that I thought was endearing, although got a little tiresome as well. But I still found the romance interesting, and I recommend this book.	2004-08-13

At least that's the surface story. This particular story wasn't my favorite of the series, but it was still good. The characters were interesting, but sometimes not very believable. Caroline had a plan in her life after being heartbroken too many times by men to have a family through a man who would be a friend rather than a romantic lover. This idea was laughable though, after you meet Caroline and realize she's extremely lively and fun-loving, so I found it rather hard to believe she would think of wanting this kind of marriage. Gideon is a man from a cold-hearted family who didn't want him, and as a result was convinced he was not capable of loving anyone, and would not inflict on a wife or child the same cold-blooded life in which he was raised in. However, once you meet Gideon and see how caring he is regarding employees and considerate, you'd see immediately uncaring is the last thing he is. His courteousness sometimes was to the point of being completely unbelievable, as NO employer would go of their way to do half the things this man did for his hired help. Obviously, love and lust bloomed between the two, plus adding in a refugee baby in the mix, and its a great recipe for love and disaster. The obstacles and attitude these people had were sometimes hard to stomach, simply because it seemed often the author forgot what personality she gave her own characters and would often make them do things that simply did not fit. However, I highly recommend it as it was a sweet romance and the pay-off was quite satisfying.	2004-08-03

It was the first book I read of the Cattleman series, although I plan on reading shortly Matt and Helena's story, which intrigues me greatly. There's much tweaking in this book from the other romances, although they have already happened, so it does pique your interest, which I'm sure is the whole point.<BR>   This book was strange in that I actually liked the man much better than the woman. I thought Jamie was rather egotistical in many ways, and entirely too head-strong for her own good. I've noticed that some authors in their quest to make their woman very strong and with a backbone, they tend to overreach it and make them so head-strong, they are plain stupid. That's Jamie to a tee. She's so full of what SHE wants, she doesn't care what the consequences are. For anything she wants. She makes foolish mistakes even if she knows her life is in danger, but hey, she wants to have a horse-back ride. She wants Sheikh Ben, so she's going to seduce him whether he likes it or not. He did, of  course, like it, but he was also trying to be honorable, and I thought she was pretty careless about that. Ben had a tendency to come off as unemotional throughout the book, but I tend to think it was the fault of the author to rush the book forward, so didn't go into depth in some places she could have. I think Ben was the most more mature individual of the two where Jamie acted quite frequently like an adolescent.<BR>   All in all, it was a nice romance, and they made a good couple, both head-strong and independent. Should make for an interesting marriage, and I hope mention is made of them to see how they are in future books. I recommend it.	2004-07-18

Susannah is madly in love with this dangerous brooding man. The problem? He had an unsuccessful love with her perfect sister, and still apparently carried the torch. However, he came to offer her a job to go undercover with him, and she agreed. Soon, the inevitable happened and they were running from danger and submitting to their passions. This is a sweet romance, and you really do like both characters. It doesn't have the snazziest of writing, and sometimes seems rather simple and slow, but the romance was a very effecting one. The danger and intrigue was not bad as a backdrop and kept as a continual focus where some other romance novels may leave it as a weak side story that's often forgotten when the passion runs high. I recommend this book if you want a simple sweet romance and two likeable characters.	2004-06-14
US	43997930	R2S5SG3BF4EZSD	0263108228	604129480	Forbidden Wine	Books	4	3	4	N	N	second chances and new love	This is the story of Briane and Heath. Briane was an orphan with an irresponsible sister, Briony, who had a child with her boyfriend, Reece. However, neither wanted the kid so Briane loved him. Eventually, they disappeared with her holding the bag when Reece's father swooped in and mistakenly thinking the girl was actually Briony and the boy was her son, his grandson, insisted they return to his home with him. Love blossomed between them almost immediately, despite the 19 year age difference. In actuality, not as much fuss was made of the age difference than Heath's past with his deceased wife and her acquaintances that still cast a shadow. I didn't find the age difference at all offensive, but I did find some of the treatment that Heath gave Bree hard to take. But, unfortunately, this was typical in romance novels of this era. Women get treated like dirt and take it without question, and the man eventually realizes his mistake and SOMETIMES apologizes for past behavior. This was a sweet story of second chances for Heath, a very cynical man, and new love for Bree, who was very innocent. So, I recommend this book, for the romance if nothing else and you're willing to overlook some of the era's ideas of how women should be treated.	2004-05-31

I found both characters to be very immature in their behavior half the time and the rest, acting absurdly old. Cassie was only 20, almost 21, and wanted her guardian to fall in love with her, so she tried to get him to notice her by acting immature and goofy. Her guardian, Blake, was only 32 I think, and acted 50 half the time, pretendin their age difference was this insurmountable gap. Cassie made me the most angry with her manipulations to seduce Blake and then after she began to wise up, she was angry with him for believing her lies to begin with. Blake was a stick in the mud sometimes, but I felt sorry for him  half the time. Not the best in the way of a mature story, I like romances with age differences, but I like it when they at least act reasonably their age. A nice romance, but not my favorite.	2004-05-18

Carne was a sculptor with attitude and had a reclusive getaway that he opened to 19 year old Rowan's stepmother. In order to get in, her stepmother lied about her age and Rowan had to live with the lie as well as other lies that would put her in a bad light. Carne fell for her, but as seems to be typical of Harlequins in the age this book was written, he treated her fairly cruelly quite often. Rowan was framed for stealing, but ultimately was vindicated. Fairly standard in parts, but the romance had its high points, if you're willing to look past the claws he often treats her with.	2004-05-13

Their love simmered from the beginning, but Adam had a strong sense of propriety while Beth mended and tried to keep her at arm's length while caring for her. Obviously in these romances, that never works!! Typically, they fight their feelings for so long and then at the end...

Its a good book to lose yourself into the sweet romance without any X-rated scenery. Marion is a woman who lost her husband and is trying to raise a son alone, and Luke is an egocentric doctor who came to value Marion's skill as a nurse, and soon a woman too. It was inevitable they would come together, despite the fairly ordinary obstacles thrown at them. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a sweetly innocent romance without all the raunch.	2004-05-13

Caroline is running away from her lost love, another forbidden flame for different reasons, and takes a nanny job in Mexico. Her boss is a horrible man, but its brother, Luis, who captures her heart. The problem? He's a priest, or almost one. But he's just as taken by her, and they fight predictably their feelings and each other.

However, soon, predictably, nature takes its course and they have their way. Afterward, jealousy and predictable obstacles threaten, but everything works out.

They were too short, and therefore I think in places they moved too fast and covered too much ground with too little time  and attention paid to some details. Also, as I noticed with some of Ms. Palmer's other works, she often made some mistakes with continuity, and some of the phrasing she used could be confusing and construed several different ways. But on the whole, all the stories were good.<BR>   Calhoun and Abby: A sweet love story, and contrary to what some thought, I saw no taboo. Abby was over the age of consent, and there was no blood between them. True, she was his ward, but so what? Men haven't married their wards, we had a president in our history that did so! Provided he didn't go after her when she was 15 or something, there's no taboo involved. I thought Calhoun was a bit too much of a playboy, but at least he stopped playing when he started noticing Abby. 4 stars for this one.<BR>   Justin and Shelby: Not my favorite of the three, as I didn't seem to get involved in this one emotionally as much as the others. In the first book, Abby was charged with being too immature, I found Shelby most immature of all. She was lying all the time, much too embarrassed for her age, and she acted really stupid when things didn't go her way, like speeding down a highway at 80 mph. But Justin I had more sympathy for. I gave this one maybe 3 and a half stars.<BR>   Finally Tyler and Nell. I liked this one a lot. Nell paid a little too much credence to the incident that shied her away from men I felt, but oh well. Tyler was patient and I thought he was a great leading man. I gave this one 4 stars.<BR>   I really loved how all three stories were tied together and they mentioned all three couples in each one, so you can keep tabs on their progress, even after marriage. The only other grips I have is all three women seem to be slightly different takes on the same person. I didn't mind that they were all virgins, I thought it was nice. But, change their personality somewhat, please. I recommend this book though, completely.	2002-01-07

At first, she disdained him, and absolutely detested it when her grandmother hired Mike to become Georgina's chaperone when she went out on dates with very 'suitable' men. But, Mike wanted her for himself and she soon wanted him for herself too. They fought the attraction, as the hero and heroine always do in these books, but it was still a great story!

Its not thrilling necessarily, but it was still good. Better than satisfactory. Archer is a man with a past who just wanted to make a clear start in Arkansas, rebuilding a house of a friend. But  he soon saw the lovely Rita, a woman with a passion for gypsy earrings. They soon found each other, and then found themselves embroiled in a mystery in their strange neighborhood. Not only Archer was interested in the lovely Rita. Both characters were characters with a past, but they still found love with each other and believably still tried to fight it. Rita stood  by Archer through some very hard times, and Archer couldn't seem to stay away from Rita even though he told himself to. The characters were likeable for the most part, but I sometimes felt the whole thing was moving too fast, which seemed OUT of character in how they were introduced. I also found the ending a bit too contrived and convenient, like the author had read one too many Agatha Christie novels and tried to be different, but made it too pat for my taste. But i still recommend this book.	2002-01-02

Krijn is an emminent doctor who is attempting to write a book on bile ducts, Beatrice is a nurse who is mousy and plain and is resigned to a spinster life ahead. However, she meets the good Professor and falls for him almost immediately. The professor, notoriously absentminded, takes a little longer to catch on, and proposed a marriage of convenience. Beatrice, happy to take him however she can get him, agrees to it and secretly plans to convince him to make the marriage a real one. It take the entire book to make Krijn come to his senses, and realize he's just as crazy about her as she is about him, but along the way its a good story. I felt often sorry for Beatrice, obviously used to being ignored but really hungering for her husband to take notice of her, and I wanted often to shake Krijn and yell at him to open his eyes. But the characters are both likeable, and you really get interested in their romance despite the shortcomings. A high recommendation here.	2002-01-01

I really loved this book, although normally many of those books that involve an Arab falling for a western girl has too many exhibits of male domination over female weakness for my taste. This one does as well, to some degree, but it was saved by the romance. Jabir falls madly in love with Sara when he meets her at her father's crumbling hotel. He promptly buys the hotel and offers to save it, in exchange for Sara marrying him. She has no choice, and does so. Of course it helps that she was also infatuated with him! At first the two are awkward and unsure around each other, but I really thought Jabir was always gentle and patient with Sara, where he could have been a lot more demanding, as follows with many men of his culture. You can easily see he was crazy about her, and I always thought Sara was an idiot for not seeing it. Sara wins over Jabir's two little daughters without problem, and even wins over his father, who at first had other marriage plans for his son, the future king. Sara had to adapt to a life of great wealth, oh what hardship!, and learned to trust her new husband. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves romance!	2002-01-01

Selina was a young woman returning to her past in Greece. She was orginally only going for a vacation, but she realized she could not escape the long arm of the husband she had fled at 16 years old. Now 19, she has to face her family. Arranged to be marriaged to Alex, the head of the powerful Greek clan, AND her second cousin, she had always carried a crush on him secretly since she was very young. But she felt she was too young to wed him when her mother asked her to, and fled. Now, older and wiser, she thinks she still wants to disavow this marriage, but soon Alex changes her mind. It wasn't so much the age of Selina that got to me when she married, but that it was the same family. I also found Selina very silly and immature even at 19, forever viewing Alex in a childhood light, never as a man. I, at first, disliked Alex, but I soon began feeling sorry for him in how he couldn't seem to break past Selina's illusions. But I still give this book a mediocre thumbs up.<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-28

I thought what romance there was, and there was I won't dispute that, was offset by the careless treatment of Strong Bear and his behavior. For example, on the same evening he brings Pamela to his village to rest after her family was murdered, he swore he'd use restraint sexually, but then soon was coming on to her. She spurns his advances, and what does he do? He runs right out to his first wife, who he dislikes incidently, and has sex with her. I'd have been able to accept that, except in his mental dialogue he said he would have found any squaw that night to bed, if she hadn't been there. I guess were supposed to forgive this act because Strong Bear was thinking of Pamela the whole time. So, why then did he do it at all?  Some love he has for Pamela, huh? Her family gets murdered, and she had to sleep with him?? Strong Bear says he has insatiable needs and obviously, unlike the warriors in other of Ms. Edwards books, this warrior was never taught restraint. Srong Bear then expected Pamela to share him with another women, and I felt Pamela than accepted this too easily without complaint. She started out as a strong character then ended up a weak-willed women, willing to accept things she normally never would. I found the death of Strong Bear's first wife too contrived as well, how convenient!! If I were Pamela, I would never trust this man to remain faithful to me! Also, a word to the wise, if you are a lover of dogs, don't read this book. There's a ritual inside you aren't going to like. NO recommendation from this reader, sorry Ms. Edwards. <BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-28

Malik may at times seem like an unsympathetic hero, because after all he does capture innocent women and sells them into the slave trade, all under his cause of freeing a people under an evil dictatorship. Amelia was one of his captives. (...) A very satisfying romance, I would recommend it to everyone!<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-22

Flynn is trying to capture a coin theif that happens to be living in Sara's rooming house. While on a stake-out, Sara accidently stumbles into Flynn's trap, and whether he likes it or not, his heart. Sara is uptight and closed off and Flynn is a ladies man. At first they deny their attraction for all their worth, and even after Sara comes to terms with her feelings, Flynn continues to fight them. They end up partners in trying to catch the thief, which of course leads to nights together. Flynn, however, certain he is not the marrying type, fights to the bitter end in trying to convince Sara and himself he doesn't love her. Of course, its a losing battle. I felt Flynn was too stubborn and Sara often not stubborn enough. I also thought Sara was too quick to dump a lifetime of values to jump into bed with Flynn after he makes it clear he wants only sex, but never love. Even if she ends up convincing him he loves her in the end, I still felt that part of the story ended up flat, and I felt Flynn never adequately apologized for breaking her heart. But, I still give this story a marginal thumbs up.<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-22

Hope Henley moved out to sunny Hollywood to find out the secret of her late grandmother's will. While working in a shop, she was approached by a couple who lives in Bachelor Arms, who claimed to have a magic mirror that had a famous ghost. Strangely enough, the ghost that appeared there looked exactly like Hope. So, Hope went to check it out, and got so frightened by the image, she ran out into traffic to get ran down by our hero, Morgan. In his guilt, (and attraction), to Hope, Morgan offered to have her stay at his apartment at Bachelor Arms to get well. They try to fight off their attraction as long as they can, as Morgan is convinced Hope is nuts by believing in the ghost theory, and he thinks his feelings for her are out of guilt alone. However, they soon realize their love is timeless and meant to be as they search to uncover the truth behind the ghost at Bachelor Arms. This book is one of a series of Bachelor Arms. I haven't read any of the others yet, so I can't comment on those. But this book was good, very romantic although a bit busy at times. But still satisfying, I would recommend it to anyone who likes a little variety in their romance stories.<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-21

Its a great story of growth through loving, and learning to love oneself and accepting the past and moving beyond it. Wade had to learn to accept the world in a non-visual way, and Sarah had to move beyond her painful past that included a very abusive marriage and uncaring parents. My only complain was that I felt denied the opportunity of Wade learning the truth of Sarah's bad marriage, as they sort of glossed over that part when the spoke of it.

The romance was very slow, and sometimes hard to follow or believe. I found Brett a much more sympathetic character, as it often seemed he had escaped one wife who was frigid to fall in love with another. For the heroine, Sarah, I really wanted to sympathize with her, but it was hard. I wanted to shake her all the time and scream at her to open her eyes and quit feeling sorry for herself. Millions of women get jilted every day unfortunately, but they don't spend the rest of their lives feeling sorry over themselves for it. Brett DID sometimes seem a bit hard toward Sarah, but I found it understandable when he often took his bad memories out on her, as Sarah often seemed a recreation of his wife who he hated. The love scenes were a bit boring and hard to understand, but I do lightly recommend this book. But only lightly.<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-21

I like some of Charlotte Lamb's books, but unfortuntaly, like many of her books of the 70s and 80s, this one also features a hero that is cruel and sadistic to a women is really not so sympathetic herself. Sara is an artist who has an infatuation with her guardian of many years. Nick is a banker who sees her and wants her. But he gets the mistaken impression she's a swinger and although he desires her, has contempt for her. I was forced to sit through endless tirades of Nick blasting Sara's supposed personality which wasn't even true, and I was always thinking that he's such a hypocrite because it didn't stop him from taking what he could from women like the woman he thought Sara was! Even at the end, when he finally found out Sara's true nature and she called him on his hypocritical behavior, he didn't seem enough repentant to me. Here he's admitting there were other women after he met her, and he had been grousing about thinking she had other men. It was ridiculous. I can't really recommend this book, unless it sounds appealing to you.<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-21

Young 17 year old Domine was orphaned at a very early age but was put through school by a rich old man who seemed to be fond of her. After he died, she had to leave her convent school and was thrust in the home of James, her new guardian. Although 20 years older than herself, she still found him very attactive, as he did her. But he fought his feelings for as long as possible, until neither could deny their love anymore. A pleasant story, although a bit boring and stale in places, and sometimes Ms. Mather was a bit hard to understand where she was going with some scenes and plot lines.

Dawn is a photojournalist hired by Byron to photograph his ancient Scottish castle for future use as a tourist spot, a fact he's none too pleased with but is being pressured into. They are attracted right off, but both are too strong-willed and independent to do anything about but snipe. I found Byron often too arrogant and chauvinistic and too unforgiving when Dawn made her point clear, which was usually with merit. He only wanted to see his own way though, and her feelings often didn't matter. However, the ending was satisfying, and I suppose was worth the tale beforehand.

This book has Travis, an ex-CIA agent who ends up in an emergency room where nurse Randi is. Little does Travis know, but long ago Nurse Randi worked in a fertility clinic where Travis made a 'deposit', and now he has a son that he is shocked to discover. Randi is a virginal mother, extremely fearful of all men because of sexual abuse as a child, but Travis is patient and although at first he was more interesting in getting to know his son, his feelings for Randi grows and grows until he's fallen hook, line, and sinker. I also enjoyed Travis' downhome country attitude that's always polite to the ladies. Very affecting. It takes awhile for Randi to overcome her childhood memories, but the pay off is great. This book is not as romantic as 'Wild Cherries', but still very good. I would recommend it well.<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-20

This book was okay, but no where near her best. Megan is a nurse who is working with the imminent Dutch doctor, Jake van Belfeld. He falls for her nearly immediately, but for Megan, she's in a stale engagement with very 'suitable' Oscar, with whom she shares little to no passion, but she's very comfortable with and believes is best for her. But when Oscar falls for megan's little sister, Megan does the honorable thing and backs out. What she doesn't realize is Dr. Benfeld is waiting for her to realize that HE'S the man of her dreams, but it takes forever for Megan to wake up and smell the antiseptic. I thought she was often a very annoying character, who didn't see anything unless its spelled out for her. But Dr. Benfeld could be just as annoying, as it was hard to realize he loved her until the very end. In fact, more than once you felt he couldn't stand her! But he was a patient man, and waited for her to open her eyes. So, I found this book light in the romance department, but I'll give it a thumbs up if you like your romance a little stale.<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-20

But neither character was too likeable I believe. He was an arrogant dictator far too used to getting his own way, and used Elysia quite cruelly often without feeling very remorseful until the end, and even then I don't feel he fully apologized for all. Elysia was often too stubborn to the point where she would cut off her nose to spite her face. In any event, I felt the two were well-matched, and seldom did Alex say or do anything that he didn't pay for in the long run, thanks to Elysia. Some things he said and did in revenge could have been unforgiveable, but in his defense, often he didn't realize that some of the things Elysia did was in protection of her own brother, instead of a lover as Alex thought. But romance did triumph in the end, and I certainly did feel the romance. A marginal recommendation.<BR>   Cyndi	2001-12-20

Gabe is attracted to Dallas from the first, but doesn't want to tell her she released a man who raped his sister, but after the rapist starts targeting Dallas as his next victem, Gabe is forced to protect the headstrong Dallas, whether she likes it or not. The romance moves quickly, and the love is believable, even though fast. I really liked Gabe's character a great deal, for a drifter. He was trying to avenge his sister, and trying to protect the woman he fell in love with. Dallas is a bit too headstrong, and she didn't figure out she helped a guilty man go free until the very end, but redeemed herself by using herself as bait.

Young Juliet is an actress in the theater who is struck down by a freak nerve disease that keeps making her fall. Her fiance is loser who wants everything perfect, so he dumps her immediately. A handsome doctor who is taking her case, Damon, has fallen in love with her immediately, but Juliet feels nothing but graditude to him, at first. She remains convinced she loves her fiance up until later in the book, after she and Damon have married. The marriage is for convenience, at least that's what the doctor tells Juliet. He wants her, so he'll do anything to get her. Its a romantic tale, but sometimes a bit sterile for my liking. It had a too pat ending medically, (...), which let's face it, is too fairy tale. (...)

Granted, the mystery of the rapidly changing name, Night Hawk to Running Hawk and back to Night Hawk again was disconcerting, but I can forgive a few mistakes. Obviously, Ms. Edwards was toying with both names and forgot which one she ultimately chose for a few pages at first. On the whole, I thought the romance was believable, but at times I felt Running Hawk's expectations were all over the place. One minute he wants her to be happy with her real father, and wear nice clothes and take advantage of all the comforts money can offer, and convinces her of it even when she resists. And then later he condemns her for it and even was going to leave her behind when he decided to return to the Comanche because he felt she was TOO attached to money! I found that hard to stomach. But, when she almost gets killed by trying to follow him anyway, he realizes how foolish he was and they reunite. Still, this see-saw was a bit silly.

The love story between Shukaha Luta and Brianna was one of the sweetest and most romantic I've read in a long time, and really has stood up to be the best after countless other romances I've read. Brianna is an innocent 17 years old girl when she meets her Indian brave, who is a grown man of 30. But, he is imprisoned, and Brianna soon risks everything to free him. They fall in love almost from first sight, but it takes a few chapters for Shunkaha to look past her young age and realize she could be all women for him! After he makes the decision, he commits to her totally. Even after separations they remain true to each other, even after he is feared dead. They always reunite happily. Even after Shunkaha realizes the Lakota can no longer live as they once did and he has to adapt, they remain devoted.

This was a good book, which was rather surprising, as I was fully prepared to dislike it from the start, as I hate the books where the woman gets captured and then falls for her captor. It always seems to weak-willed and silly. But if you stick with this book, going beyond the pages where you might dislike Iron Cloud wanting to forcefully change Damita into White Willow, you'll see his attitude changes quickly, and really you get the impression all along that he probably wouldn't have forced her into anything for very long! She eventually chose her own destiny and chose Iron Cloud and his people over her cruel cousin. Iron Cloud and Damita's love was very palpable and he was gentle and loving with her in a way that's very envious for any red-blooded woman! His devotion to Timothy was sweet, where even when Damita was pregnant, Iron CLoud had decided that even if the child was a boy, he's still give Timothy (a white child, remember), his position as chief someday.

I always bought into the romance, and I always felt Striped Eagle's love for Brenda. But there were many times when I didn't feel Brenda's love for Striped Eagle, because she always put her need for revenge ahead of everything else. I went into this book thinking it would be he would hold her captive, and she'd succumb to him eventually. But after reading it, I came to the conclusion that Brenda deserved to be held captive! She wasn't acting rationally half the time, and everytime she ran away from Striped Eagle like a little thief, she'd get into trouble and Striped Eagle would have to bail her out! Yet, she was always scheming to run away again, but he would always come for her, proving a devotion I felt she didn't deserve. I kept wanting to shake her, and tell her the revenge and justice is two different things, and instead of sacrificing love for vengeance, shouldn't she be sacrificing vengeance for love? So, a marginal thumbs up although I didn't even like the heroine in this story.	2001-12-16

I, in particular, found it difficult to believe that Becky could suddenly fall in love with Blazing Eagle after being held captive. Although she wasn't mistreated necessarily by him, she was forced to stay outside the entire time. I also found it hard to forgive Blazing Eagle for forcing Becky out later in the book when his memories of his family's massacre came to him, and he saw Becky's blond hair as too much a reminder of the woman in his nightmares. Even when he realized his mistake and took her back, I felt he didn't apologize enough and Becky was a bit too forgiving.

I did believe absolutely that Malvina and Red Wing fell in love at first sight, I thought Red Wing was a bit judgmental and quick to jump to conclusions regarding Malvina's character. I know the circumstances at first would understandably lead Red Wing to believe Malvina a criminal, he still was to quick to believe the worse without any real evidence. He misjudged her several times throughout the book, the last time he even forced her to leave, although he almost immediately regretted it. Malvina didn't help matters when she stubbornly refused to tell him the truth about her quest for revenge, but I felt Red Wing ought to have believed in her more if he loved her so much. But, this book is very romantic and I do recommend it to anyone who loves books that feature love at first sight and innocent love.   Cyndi	2001-06-30

The only aspect I felt a little hard to believe was the speed by which Falcon Hawk and Maggie developed a relationship. One day her husband was dead, and the next she was in love with this handsome Indian chief. Granted, she had never truly been 'in' love with her husband, therefore she didn't feel that kind of remorse, but it felt sort of wrong with how quickly she went from one to the other. Falcon Hawk certainly is one of Ms. Edward's more charitable and generous characters, willing from the beginning to take in Maggie's unborn child and raise as his own, even accepting Maggie having lied to him about the child's existence! I believed in their love from the beginning, so I would recommend this to anyone who loves to believe in love at first sight, if they don't mind the speed of the relationship!	2001-06-29
