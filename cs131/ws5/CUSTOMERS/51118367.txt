In the future, if a student begins to write me off as a curmudgeon, I'll be able to cite chapter and verse from this author, who's a good quarter-century younger and has a far better claim to speak with authority about such matters than I.  So, undergraduates, read and heed.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I have a few quibbles.  One inference of the Ivey Guide is that a great many admission decisions are made on the basis of personal essays, interviews, and recommendations.  Actually, as Ms. Ivey would probably agree, most decisions are based flatly and unimaginatively on GPA, LSAT, and minority status (if applicable).  My feeling is that the other materials often serve largely as conscience salve for the typical admissions officer (of which Ms. Ivey was certainly not).  In my experience, essays, recommendations, and the like prove most significant for those at the top and bottom of the food chain: to students applying at the twenty top-ten law schools (the probable target market for this book) and students who will gladly take anything above the California unaccrediteds.<br /><br />I also hold reservations about the sample essays and sample recommendations given in the appendix.  The good ones are better than the bad ones for sure, but I found myself disliking all the authors.  To me the best of the essays sound like they were written by slick showoffs.  (At least the authors either have great writing skills or good ghostwriters.)  As for faculty recommendations, I've had numerous students admitted to the best law schools without ever having written anything longer than this review.  I wonder if there are now admissions officers out there with a permanent wince because of the longer rambling essays and recommendations that are likely to appear because of the advice given in this book.the advice given in this book.	2005-09-24

Rookies may here find classroom techniques worth implementing, and veterans will enjoy making comparisons with their own classrooms.<br /><br />Allitt is a lively writer, and his unwillingness to embrace easy, politically correct interpretations of American history increases the reader's confidence in his classroom judgment. (But what does it say about the current state of the historical profession when a first-rate teacher refuses to assign a textbook even though many of his students are so obviously ignorant of basics?)<br /><br />Clearly Professor Allitt is a good teacher, one who does much more than \\"turn the crank\\" on the survey course.  Nevertheless, he also makes plain the wearying aspects of his position, especially what he perceives to be necessary accommodation to the rudeness and irresponsibility of his overprivileged undergraduates.  For despite the truculent-sounding title, this book exudes a genial acquiescence to the trimming of academic sails.	2005-09-09

(In Recovering the Past, we learn that McDonald's monumental research for that book was, in part, made possible by his capacity for living simply and sleeping hardly at all.)<br /><br />Although McDonald has written a number of important books since the 1950s, the most important contribution of this brief and fast-paced memoir is the author's summary of twentieth-century American historiography from a conservative point of view.  McDonald spends one of his seven chapters describing the \\"New History\\"-\\"The World as I Entered It\\"-and then harrumphs his way through the remainder of the century, concluding with some well-deserved tongue clucking at the malfeasance of Michael Bellesiles.<br /><br />Unlike most memoirs, McDonald passes quickly over his earliest years, either because he's not the introspective sort or so that he can spend more time glorying in his early academic successes.  His self-praise (though often deserved) will probably strike many readers as amusing.  Many historians have probably thought, but few have written, \\"I did a smashing job; the book reads like a novel.\\" (94)<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a fine memoir, easy to read and digest.  You don't even have to like McDonald or his professional score-settling to admire his literary craftsmanship.	2005-08-30

Vogel knows the young Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon inside and out, but he doesn't seem to know how to summarize what he knows--or to ignore what he only supposes.<br /><br />Vogel's thesis is that Joseph Smith's motivation for founding a new religion arose in conflicts that occurred within his semi-dysfunctional family.  While there is undoubtedly truth to this notion, Vogel insists on taking us through the Book of Mormon blow-by-blow to explicate his argument.  Some of his conclusions are clever and perceptive, others in-the-ballpark possible, and some (at best) strained.  For instance, in Vogel's reading, the Book of Mormon account of Lamanites forcing women and children to eat the flesh of their husbands and fathers while restricting the prisoners' access to water is supposed to illustrate Smith's \\"oral rage\\" at his father \\"mixed with the fever, thirst, and torture of childhood surgery.\\" (374)  There's always something poignant about religious skeptics putting their trust in this sort of psychobabble.<br /><br />Readers can expect a good deal of autobiography in a first novel, but they should also expect a good deal of fiction.  Vogel occasionally seems annoyed when there is no obvious autobiographical hook on which to hang his notions.  On one occasion, he suggests that a portion of the Book of Mormon is \\"perhaps...literary license\\"(211).  Well, yes, literary license is what novels are about.<br /><br />Furthermore, Vogel's knowledge of the Bible is weaker than he imagines, and his solution of picking up the nearest commentary frequently leads him astray, especially when he believes its opinion is so obviously correct that it requires no citation.  For instance, he argues (with Edward Gibbon) that Luke \\"specifically said\\" that the darkness at Christ's crucifixion was \\"caused by an eclipse...astronomically impossible during paschal full moon.\\" (286)  But Luke 23: 45 says no such thing.  In another place, Vogel announces, on the basis of no cited authority, that the mention of Melchizedek in Psalm 110 was \\"intended as a statement about Israelite rulers who were seen as kingly priests.\\"<br /><br />Any serious student of Mormonism will find much of profit in this biography.  For example, Vogel notes every error and anachronism that he finds in the Book of Mormon--a considerable heap by page 557.  But as biography--and especially readable biography--Vogel's attempt is overly long and overly speculative.as \\"caused by an eclipse...astronomically impossible during paschal full moon.\\" (286)  But Luke 23: 45 says no such thing.

Jan Shipps, perhaps the most influential non-Mormon historian of Mormonism, does not present a true autobiography here but instead anthologizes her unpublished essays, some of which go back to the 1960s.  As is often the case with collections of essays, their importance and quality varies widely, and everyone will have his own favorites and non-favorites.<br /><br />Personally, I like Shipps' review of John Brooke's Refiner's Fire and her many autobiographical asides (Too bad she decided not to discuss the rearing of her son, the noted violinist Stephen Shipps.)  Also highly recommended for any student of Mormonism are the notes, which follow each chapter and were definitely written to be read.<br /><br />On the other hand, I began wincing every time Shipps invoked the mantra of her Methodism--especially since John Wesley would have pronounced her a heretic out of hand.  For instance, Shipps' essay on \\"Is Mormonism Christian?\\" commences with mention of her Methodism and then runs on for twenty pages without defining either \\"Mormon\\" or \\"Christian.\\"	2005-05-08

I've never yet read a bibliographical essay that read like a novel, but considering its genre, this is a nicely written series of essays full of valuable insights.  Since the authors are all Mormon scholars, it is hardly surprising that the book gently leans toward \\"faith promoting\\" works and includes occasional sentences like the one that describes anti-Mormon literature as \\"generally filled with distorting emotion and `facts' that are either faulty or lacking context.\\" (261)  Nevertheless, an educated reader can easily triangulate around this genial bias and learn much about the history of the Latter-day Saints in the process.	2005-05-02

Guttridge has done a fine job of assembling the scattered sources for a history of the Greely expedition--especially the diaries kept by expedition members--and he is a excellent writer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Guttridge's characters are almost uniformly antiheroic: torpid, irresponsible, irrational, immature and consumed by petty bickering. Adolphus Greely seems to have had a genuinely useful career both before and after the Arctic episode that made him famous.  But once the story reaches the ice, it's hard for the reader to decide whom he dislikes most: Greely, the pig-headed commander; his second-rate and nearly mutinous party; the inept and unlucky attempted rescuers; or the wooden-headed bureaucrats back in Washington D.C.<br /><br />The book might have been tightened up a bit.  For instance, the posterior protection in which the bureaucrats seemed constantly engaged could have been presented more succinctly.  Also, there's a flatness to the characterization that, considering all the scribbling going on while the party starved to death, seems surprising.	2005-04-03

Ellis's brief volume offers more of a contemporary commentary on Washington's life rather than a typical nuts-and-bolts biography.  And that's all to the good so long as the reader knows what sort of book he's engaged.  His Excellency is a joy to read, and Ellis is a master storyteller (a gift that contributed to some recent academic unpleasantness).  Ellis's Washington makes sense to me: a colonial aristocrat who sought, like some ancient Roman, to achieve both material success and the approbation of posterity--and got them both.  Few men have been able to achieve such greatness and then also had greatness thrust upon them.	2005-03-25

Like those biographies, this one of Spurgeon is intended to be both inspirational and historically accurate.  The difficulties of simultaneously attempting to promote the faith while providing a \\"warts-and-all\\" biography are obvious, but Dallimore handles the challenge well.<br /><br />Dallimore, the Baptist pastor, emphasizes a Spurgeon who was a whirlwind of pastoral commitments, a hearty Calvinist who supervised a magnificent range of church-oriented social service activities.  (To an agnostic he once retorted, \\"The God who answereth by Orphanages, Let Him Be God.\\") No wonder that after spending nearly forty years in the pulpit, Spurgeon died before he was sixty.<br /><br />Dallimore also properly stresses Spurgeon's principled withdrawal from the Baptist Union, with all the hurtful criticism that that decision engendered--as well as its prophetic anticipation of religious decline in the twentieth century.  Yet it is also heartening to read of Spurgeon's warm relationship with those other evangelical giants of the late nineteenth century, D. L. Moody and Hudson Taylor, who didn't always cross their \\"t's\\" the same way as the London Baptist.<br /><br />I would have preferred a bit more on Spurgeon's theology, the historic setting in which his ministry developed, and the contrast between his periods of deep depression and his reputation as a \\"bubbling fountain of humor.\\" Nevertheless, for the modern general reader, this life of Charles Haddon Spurgeon is perhaps the best introduction to the greatest of all nineteenth-century evangelical preachers .	2005-02-25

The Millenarian World of Early Mormonism is not only good scholarship, it's clearly and carefully written and with an minimum of the pseudo-profundity that fledgling scholars often feel obligated to display.  Underwood's thesis is that belief in the imminent Second Coming of Christ permeated the early nineteenth-century culture from which Mormonism sprang and that the doctrine exerted a significant influence on early Mormonism, including aiding its missionary effort in England.  Even scholarly Mormons tend to finesse the historical problems with their religion, but LDS bias is rarely detectable here.

Mormons and Gentiles will differ as to how successfully he manages these disparate aims, but publication by Oxford University Press rightly suggests that this book is not simply a tract for the faithful.  Givens wants the Book of Mormon (BOM) to be taken seriously by secular academics, and he agreeably assimilates and cites many non-Mormon authorities.<br /><br />Givens rightly emphasizes that the BOM was less important for its doctrinal novelties than for the prophetic recognition it provided Joseph Smith.  He correctly dismisses any notion that the BOM was Calvinistic, and he appropriately scoffs at LDS liberals who would prefer to abandon supernaturalism and interpret the BOM symbolically.<br /><br />Nevertheless, specialists in Mormon studies will surely note the many areas in which Givens slides over inconvenient evidence in the interest of apologetics. Neither are Givens' parallels between the BOM and ancient eastern documents very convincing because Smith was clearly permeated by the poetic idiom of the Bible.  As for the phenomenal speed at which Smith dictated the book to Oliver Cowdery, the fact that no average person could do it doesn't mean that no one could.  (I'm not able to score a touchdown for the Steelers, record a convincing performance of the Mendelssohn violin concerto, or play fifty simultaneous games of chess blindfolded.  But some people have done those things and continue to do them.) Givens attempt to move the geography of the BOM, with its giant cities and mammoth populations, to relatively uninvestigated areas of Central America is a stopgap that may eventually prove even more embarrassing to the LDS Church, especially now that written Mayan has been translated.  Nor will  making \\"steel\\" bronze and such like do much towards eliminating the many anachronistic howlers in the Book of Mormon.<br /><br />Because Givens is a professor of English, I had hoped that he would address Mark Twain's famous charge that the Book of Mormon was \\"chloroform in print.\\" Givens is honest enough to repeat that jibe, but he doesn't try to excuse the BOM's literary weakness.  Its cardboard characters (so unlike those of the Bible and other classic literature) remind me of the ones created by Upton Sinclair--who himself could crank out an astronomical daily word count.  It's ironic that Givens' book, which in many places is arcane and overly theoretical, is more thoughtful and interesting than the religious text he attempts to defend.ok of Mormon. <br /> <br />Because Givens is a professor of English, I had hoped that he would address Mark Twain's famous charge that the Book of Mormon was \\"chloroform in print.\\" Givens is honest enough to repeat that jibe, but he doesn't try to excuse the BOM's literary weakness.

The Congregationalist/Presbyterians overemphasized education and the formalities of religion to the detriment of evangelism.  The Moravians were steady and apolitical, but their reliance on the lot and their determination to establish a farming community of converts retarded their work.  The Methodists' emotionalism and protracted meetings attracted the Indians (who had counterparts in their own religion), but their anti-intellectualism, low standards for conversion, and \\"sheep stealing\\" were negative traits.<br /><br />My only criticisms of this long book (with fairly small print) are that McLoughlin sometimes goes beyond evidence in trying to reconstruct the nature of the anti-missionary reaction among the Cherokees and that he asserts mundane reasons for decisions that the missionaries more likely made on spiritual grounds.	2005-01-06

Nevertheless, Josephy easily slides over important subjects he doesn't care to discuss, such as the dissolution of his first marriage, the difficulties of writing history from oral tradition, and the decisions he made as editor of American Heritage.<br /><br />Furthermore, although Josephy is proud of his New Deal liberalism, he pulls punches when describing the political personalities of his era. For instance, he describes Harry Bridges as \\"a tough Australian-born dockworker\\" and Howard Fast as a \\"successful author honored for his writings by the Soviet Union\\" without noting that both were Communists.  In other words, early on the reader begins to suspect that Josephy's political views were either more naïve or a bit further to the left than he now cares to admit.  Also depressing is his glorification of all things Indian, including Native American superstition--as if rattles and medicine bundles were privileged in a way that the mumbo jumbo of Mexican Catholic priests was not.<br /><br />Josephy worked at Time magazine a few years after Whittaker Chambers, the nemesis of Alger Hiss, had resigned.  Josephy's family was nurturing, Chambers' dysfunctional.  Josephy's autobiography is nicely structured, Chambers' Witness (1952), misshapen and overlong.  Nevertheless, in Chambers' autobiography we encounter a soul, here only the persona of a facile writer lucky enough to have chosen a topic popular in his own age.	2005-01-02

The chaos that accompanied the Civil War proved to be the watershed that burned \\"diversity and innovation\\" (145) from the Cove.  Yet even so, family life at the turn of the century \\"was largely indistinguishable from that of other rural Tennesseans.\\" (200)<br /><br />Although the book is well researched and nicely written, the chapters seem to have been composed independently, which results in some repetition.  Also a better acquaintance with the history of American religion would have limited the author's surprise at progressivism and religious fundamentalism walking hand-in-hand.	2004-12-29

Likewise, few scholars (except perhaps for Henige's professional enemies and a few unfortunate graduate students) will read it all the way through without skipping pages and even whole chapters.<br /><br />Henige need not worry.  His book needed to be written, and his thesis is sound.  \\"High Counters\\" have indeed grossly exaggerated the pre-contact population of American Indians on the basis of virtually nothing but the desire to take a currently fashionable position.  Wisely, Henige reminds his readers that there are places historians cannot go because no evidence remains and that this lack of evidence can become an opportunity for wild conjecture on the part of those who have ideological axes to grind.<br /><br />Of necessity whoever took on the \\"High Counters\\" had to drudge through the facts and figures to prove them misguided, and the drudging doesn't always make for engaging reading.  Nevertheless, Henige ranges widely and engagingly in his series of essays, treating such profitable topics as numerical exaggerations in classical texts and even in works of imagination.  Some passages are so witty I laughed out loud.	2004-12-23

A fuller account of Debo's story is well worth the telling if for no other reason than that Leckie sands down the edges of some of the more extreme claims made on Debo's behalf in \\"Indians, Outlaws and Angie Debo,\\" the 1988 PBS film produced by Barbara Abrash and Martha Sandlin.  (Debo herself had a hand in creating one serious inaccuracy in the film by implying that her beloved mentor, Edward Everett Dale, had prevented her best-known work, And Still the Waters Run, from being published by the University of Oklahoma Press.)<br /><br />Leckie's biography is sympathetic without being uncritical, and the author notes how Debo's independent thinking may have hindered as well as advanced her career.  Debo was a life-long diary keeper, and Leckie makes good use of those many volumes in a biography that is sensibly, if not excitingly, written.  I would have preferred less about Debo's reactions to news events and foreign travels and more about Debo's religion, which is treated cursorily even though Debo both served as a Methodist lay pastor and opposed missionary activity on the reservation.	2004-12-22

But it should be noted that Kephart's isolated mountaineers were poorer and more prone to crime and violence than were the average residents of the Smokies at the turn of the twentieth century--certainly so in comparison with contemporary inhabitants of Cades Cove.<br /><br />Kephart's belief that mountain speech descended from Chaucer and Shakespeare and that mountain culture was grounded in that of the Highland Scots is now, at best, disputed.  Finally, the author's romanticized treatment of moonshining should be read in light of his own bouts with alcoholism and his death in an automobile accident caused by a driver who had been drinking the stuff.	2004-12-02

McCullough is a great writer now, and he was a great writer in 1968 when he was only in his mid-thirties.  Perhaps if McCullough were redoing the book today, he would cite his sources and reduce the number of characters who are introduced at the beginning and then only brought back at the end when the reader has forgotten who they are.  Otherwise, Johnstown Flood is a model of grace, clarity and style.  Effortless reads like this book require the hand of a master craftsman, and McCullough is such a one.	2004-11-11

Royster's commentary on his childhood and youth is full of engaging detail, whereas his comments about the influential politicians he interviewed at the height of his career seem commonplace by comparison.  So the book draws the reader in with its careful prose and good humor and then eventually disappoints because the original tone can't be maintained.  A further problem is that Royster, a moderate conservative, has no religious, and few philosophical, anchors for his editorial positions-or at least few he cares to share with the reader.	2004-10-25

Evans is a clever writer, and his opinionated handling of fifteen stories doesn't bother me because I usually agree with him.  But his narrative treatment is (like many of his subjects) tawdry.  Furthermore, the reader should be wary of factual errors.  Some years ago I enjoyed reading Evan's short version of the Sacco-Vanzetti case in his Casebook of Forensic Detection (1996).  In my view he was absolutely correct about Sacco's guilt-but he also called Sacco's Colt automatic pistol a revolver.  The warning lights came up.

Owen well communicates the seemingly impossible odds against which Chester Carlson struggled, especially a youth spent in grinding poverty.  Owen has an eye for detail that makes his characters live and an ear for words that rarely misses the mark.  He provides both a good introduction to copying before xerography and a stimulating essay on his sources.  The illustrations are well chosen, and full captions serve as an outline of his story.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Owen's journalistic background sometimes works against him, as for instance, when he introduces an interview-demonstration straight into the text.  What would be perfectly appropriate for a New Yorker essay sounds strained here.  It would have been better to have replaced it with some David Macaulay-style graphics to aid the reader in understanding the technical aspects of early Xerox copiers.  Also, I should hope that other books of this quality do not omit citations as Owen's does.<br /><br />These are quibbles.  Copies in Seconds is an excellent book, the sort that may tempt you to sneak away from your responsibilities to finish.	2004-09-27

The book is completely understandable picked up anywhere and with no knowledge of what came before or interest in what comes after.  What McCarthy has done is given us a series of short animal behavior stories taken from scientific literature but run through her considerable wit and sprightly--even sassy--literary style.  The author has a thesis of sorts, but the true message of this book is that anyone who believes animal behavior to be simplistic or consistent across species is ridiculously mistaken and that no one will ever go broke betting on the complexity of the natural world.	2004-09-27

Ray regularly sent his notebook diaries back to the homefolks, and perhaps for that reason, the diaries tend to be emotionally flat.  Although the 7th Wisconsin suffered some of the heaviest casualties of any unit in the Union Army, Ray does not reflect on his perilous situation, and he refers to the dead and wounded largely as statistics rather than as friends and comrades.  Occasional passages do rise above Ray's typically mundane entries--for instance, his description of being lost in the rain during the skirmishing of August 18-21, 1864.<br /><br />This diary will be largely of interest to Civil War buffs curious about the soldiers' daily life.  Although the editors' contributions are adequate, the explanatory notes might have better explained to 21st century readers the realities that Civil War armies took for granted.  Comparisons of Ray's journal with similar diaries would also have been helpful.	2004-09-14

A facile popular treatment--there is no index--the book also includes loosely connected chapters on Emily Dickinson, the history of forgery, and the questionable ethics of major auction houses.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Worrall needs better editing.  Not only does he repeat himself, he also makes a number of small errors about Mormon history and practice.  If Worrall believes, as I do, that Joseph Smith was a fake, fraud, and sex addict, then he might have increased his credibility with more judicious language and more careful checking of his facts.<br /><br />Furthermore, Worrall might better have tied Emily Dickinson's fist-shaking against God with Hofmann's using any number of quotes from the teenage Dickinson to draw parallels with Hofmann's rebellion against Mormonism during the same period of his life. (For instance, the fifteen-year-old Dickinson wrote, \\"The world allured me & in an unguarded moment I listened to her siren voice. From that moment I seemed to lose interest in heavenly things.... I felt my danger & was alarmed, but I had rambled too far to return & ever since my heart has been growing harder.\\" Fortunately, Dickinson was not attracted to forgery or explosives.)<br /><br />Finally, after hypothesizing that Hofmann was largely motivated to commit his crimes by his enmity against the LDS Church, Worrall should have examined the extent to which the Hofmann forgeries damaged Mormonism.  Such a conclusion would have been more satisfying than Worrall's retailing of self-serving statements by Hofmann's ex-wife or his attempt to turn Amherst curator Daniel Lombardo into the tale's hero.	2004-08-16

Maclean uses historical techniques to reconstruct the Mann Gulch fire of August 5, 1949, but his exposition is poetic rather than historical.  For example, the author imagines his characters' thoughts and ponders the writing process as well as his wife's death from cancer.  Sometimes Maclean's lyrical prose seems just and apt, at other times silly and pretentious.  I suppose every reader could put together his own list of good and bad sentences.<br />As examples of the former let me suggest two from the first paragraph of Chapter One: \\"In 1949 the Smokejumpers were not far from their origins as parachute jumpers turned stunt performer dropping from the wings of planes at county fairs just for the hell of it plus a few dollars, less hospital expenses.... They were still so young they hadn't learned to count the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy.\\" (19)<br />As examples of the latter, I offer two from near the end of the book: \\"...the compassion felt for themselves by the tragic young is self-pity transformed into some divine bewilderment, one of the few emotions in which the young and the universe are the only characters.  Although divine bewilderment addresses its grief to the universe, it only cries out to it.\\" (299)<br />Generally Maclean, his subject, and his literary style seem most congruent when the humanity of the Mann Gulch tragedy is addressed, less fitting when the author discusses hard science.  Perhaps recognizing this weakness, the University of Chicago Press did not create an index for this book.	2004-05-12

The authors are Canadians, perfectly at home in French, and are therefore well equipped to elucidate the differences between France and North America.  As a historian, I especially enjoyed the chapters that illustrate how the French are products of their past.<br />Ignore the bias in favor of French statism.  Just allow Adam Smith the time to take his revenge on the French welfare state.  Also as secularists (and Canadians) the authors spend almost no time with one of the most significant differences between the USA and France--religiosity.  Americans are dramatically more religious than the French, and emphasizing this distinction would have gone along way toward explaining the differences between the countries.	2004-05-05

My own guess is that the Pulitzer judges simply couldn?t resist such a first-rate biography, carefully anchored in a generation of Edwardian studies and presented here in clear, unimpeachable prose.  Even evangelicals looking for a devotional work in what Marsden calls ?the honorable but uncritical tradition of Edwards? earlier admirers&quot; should prefer this volume to Ian Murray?s 1987 biography.

(I even took a picture of Horace Kephart's grave about the time Larimore visited it.)  Set in 1981-82 (the author is coy about dates), the book describes the accommodation of a newly minted, Duke University-trained physician to the people of Appalachian North Carolina.  There are satisfying moments, but the book often bogs  down in efforts to wring profundity from the commonplace.  For instance, Chapter 24 is largely the description of a romantic dinner presented course by course.  More than once I felt I was listening to a long-winded moralist or a jokester having difficulty reaching the punch line.  Without economy and proportion, even interesting material loses its punch.  The book's spirituality is religion-lite: some prayer in crisis and, in the presence of death, talk of a generic God.  Nothing so ungentlemenly as Jesus'words that \\"no man comes to the Father except through me.\\"  Nevertheless, locals and doctors will find this memoir worth reading.	2004-02-17

Fortunately, Zinsser also included parts of the question-and-answer sessions that followed the lectures.  As he notes, these exchanges frequently sent \\"the speakers off on flights of anecdote and memory.\\"  Although the subjects of the biographies are themselves extraordinary, the editor and the biographers are exceptional craftsmen as well. (For that matter, the biographers Robert Caro and David McCullough are probably more historically significant than Alice James, one of the subjects.) This is a book meant for reading rather than for study--which among other things means that it's fun to read but has no index.  Nevertheless, the book does have a fascinating annotated bibliography, compiled by the biographers, which includes comments on both biographies and books about writing them. I'm embarrassed to say that I ran into Extraordinary Lives by accident a few months ago while browsing the aisles of my public library.  This fine book should be better known.	2004-01-28

Once underrated because of her race--and now probably overrated for the same reason-the gifted Hurston was a wandering star who might have been capable of true literary excellence if she been able to resist the destructive aspects of her personality.  Hurston's irresponsibility and sexual folly probably cost her the financial stability that would have allowed her to practice her craft without constant reference to the wolf at her door. Although Boyd's biography reveals Hurston's defects of character, the author stoutly defends Hurston against all comers.  Most painful are Boyd's excuses for Hurston's sycophancy toward silly rich white people. Wrapped in Rainbows is a much finer book than one would have reason to expect from a biographer who believes that Hurston chose her from the next world.	2004-01-20

A. J. Gordon was his best friend, D. L. Moody a respected colleague, and George M&uuml;ller a prayer partner.  Pierson encouraged Hudson Taylor to visit North America, and when C. H. Spurgeon became mortally ill, it fell to Pierson to serve as caretaker of his London pulpit.  Pierson lived long enough to critique the modern tongues movement, serve as an editor of the Scofield Reference Bible, and contribute to The Fundamentals (1909-1911).<br />Dana Robert has a clear understanding of American religious history, and her narrative skillfully interweaves the connections between higher criticism, dispensationalism, premillennialism, evangelical social reform, the Keswick holiness emphasis, and (especially) the turn-of-the-century faith missions movement.  What occasionally gets lost in this authoritative exposition is Pierson himself.  Of his private life we learn little--although perhaps a man who writes fifty books and delivers 13,000 sermons and addresses doesn't have much of a private life.<br />Occupy Until I Come is also repetitive and overly long.  A considerable amount of work went into transforming the original dissertation into this book.  But not enough.  Finally, Robert's biography doesn't work as well in Eerdmans' \\"Library of Religious Biography\\" series as well as some of the other volumes do (for instance, Lyle W. Dorsett's Billy Sunday and the Redemption of Urban America).  The requirement that the books in this series be \\"free of footnotes\\" is annoying in this case and leads to some awkward textual constructions so that Robert can identify her sources.  The general editors intend that the books in this series be \\"well-written narratives. . .read and enjoyed as well as studied.\\"  Robert writes well enough, but whether Occupy Until I Come will be \\"enjoyed\\" by the general reader is at least debatable.

(Would you believe that most books were once shelved \\"backwards\\" with their fore-edge out and their title-less spine faced in?)  Among Petroski's best chapters are the one that treats problems that arose when books had to be chained to their shelves and the one describing the development of modern library shelving so strong that it could support the library rather than the other way around.  Petroski includes many fine illustrations that that well support his theses and educated guesses.<br />Committed bibliophiles may easily tolerate the discursive, not to say meandering, course of The Book on the Bookshelf.  I reached the limit of my patience a couple of times and put the book back on the bookshelf for a while before finally completing it.

The last half of the book I took in one sitting.  We hardly care about the protagonist, Jan Baalsrud, as a personality.  He has remarkable courage and incredible physical stamina but little spiritual depth.  In the hands of a lesser writer, his story could easily have degenerated into a limp survival yarn of the sort regularly published in Reader's Digest.  But Howarth gives meaning to the story both through his fine description of the harsh natural world and by his sympathetic treatment of the dozens of volunteers who came to Baalsrud's rescue.  Their attempt to rescue one soldier at the risk of their lives became a political as well as a humanitarian cause, virtually the only blow these Norwegians could strike against German invaders in the wastelands of northern Scandinavia.	2003-12-09

More compelling is the chapter on emigrant-Indian interaction, which Unruh proves was considerably less violent and more mutually beneficial than the later myth of unremitting conflict suggests.  Unruh's discussion of emigrant-Mormon relations is too apologetic for Mormon behavior, but the chapter nevertheless explains well why overlanders and Saints often came into conflict.<br />To my mind, the best chapters are the final ones that chronicle the significant assistance that overlanders received from the West Coast.  Not only did earlier emigrants extend aid for its public relations value in the struggle to increase local populations, there was also a remarkable amount of pure humanitarian assistance, sometimes granted at considerable personal sacrifice.  The last chapter, \\"The Overlanders in Historical Perspective,\\" is a fine summary of the emigrant experience.<br />The Plains Across is now more than twenty-five years old, but it is still the standard history of the Trans-Mississippi migration.  As one of Unruh's friends wrote, \\"It is sorrowful beyond expression that this book must stand as a posthumous memorial to [the author], rather than as the beginning of an outstanding professional career.\\"	2003-08-29

Nevertheless, there were enough striking stories to carry me through the book. Auster's hand is sometimes perceptible, smoothing and refining these tales, but his presence is even more evident in the similar feel of the stories chosen.  For instance, many blend irony and chance; a number emphasize shame for youthful prejudice; and over almost all hangs an indefinite non-theistic spirituality intended to strike a cord with the post-modern reader.  I wonder what a similar anthology from 1900 or 1950 would have sounded like?	2003-08-10

Can a historian put his biases aside and write an objective account of an historical event?  Conkin's Cane Ridge demonstrates with what dignity and power a historian is able to treat a religious movement to which he has little spiritual or emotional attachment.  Conkin has written a first-rate intellectual history that includes the best delineation of biblical Christianity by a non-believer that I've ever read.<br />Conkin's careful examination of the 1801 Kentucky revival demonstrates that the religious changes which began there had roots deep in devout, but staid, Presbyterianism.  Conkin rejects the notion that the revival was simply an example of frontier backwardness and downplays the swooning and \\"barking\\" that continue to be the staple of college lecturers.	2003-06-10

Applebaum has keen historical imagination, and her research has been remarkably thorough under the circumstances.

Applebaum might have made of this work nothing more than a string of horrors, a secular Foxe's Book of Martyrs.

I have no doubt that the Holocaust occurred or that Sherman & Grobman provide a useful compendium with which to answer those who say that it didn't.  But the authors are naively confident about both the nature of  \\"historical science\\" and the motivations of Holocaust deniers. \\"Real revision\\" and \\"dogmatic denial\\" are not necessarily opposites; they may be points on a sliding scale.  The authors' discussion of Derek Freeman's critique of Margaret Mead (247-48) reveals what a weak reed peer review can be, and that six of the fifteen attendees at the Wannsee Conference held doctorates in law ought suggest the limitations of entrusting the search for truth to professional elites. Despite the their attempts at evenhandedness, Sherman and Grobman promote their own ideologies as much as Holocaust deniers do.  Biases drive their conclusions as well. Sherman and Grobman are right about the Holocaust, less so in regard to the nature of history or the nature of man.	2003-05-05

The author's reminiscences about her life as an 18-year-old newly-wed on a chicken ranch in the Olympic Mountain region of Washington State are not profound.  But MacDonald had a practiced eye for detail and could make every word of an essay count.  Perhaps what makes The Egg and I so successful is that MacDonald can convey the essence of her experience without lapsing into either bitterness or sentimentality.<br />As for the portraits of Indians whom she met: few would argue that she was malevolent or wrong-headed, just that such things are politically incorrect and shouldn't be said today.  More sobering is her smoking, the mark of a liberated woman in the 1920s, a sophisticated affectation that almost certainly contributed to her early death in 1958.	2003-02-09

Schiavone, whose self described \\"difficult Italian\\" has been translated for this volume, has provided me with a number of significant insights that I hope to use in future lectures--notably ideas from Chapter 9, \\"Slaves, Nature, Machines.\\"<br />Nevertheless, the book is too long by about half and filled with academic name dropping.  The author spends overmuch time trying to convince his readers that he has a thorough command of his sources in all languages.  He does.  But that's what footnotes are for.  Furthermore, dragging in moderns like Marx, Hegel, and Weber does little to advance his argument--although it may have encouraged Harvard to accept this book for its list.  Even more strained is Schiavone's argument that at the end of the Republic there was a window of opportunity for Rome to have abandoned its slave-based economy and to have moved towards a more modern notion of productivity.	2003-01-03

Reading this fresh portrait of TR brought back memories of people and events that once seemed as familiar to me as those in my own life.  Morris has thoroughly researched this second volume of his planned three-volume biography, but I have two mild complaints: 1. Morris is addicted to the sort of fine writing that delights in obscure words and unusual metaphors.  Sometimes these conceits are so clever that the reader's attention is drawn from Roosevelt to the author's style; sometimes they just fall flat.  2. Morris is a master at using a trivial detail to illumine character or incident.  But some trivia is but trivia after all--a lot of banquet menus, for instance--and I regret that Morris did not use the space to better account by setting Roosevelt in his era as William Harbaugh has done in Power and Responsibility: The Life and Times of Theodore Roosevelt (1961).	2002-12-10

Coe provides a fine introduction to the decoding of ancient languages and to what is known of Mayan history, but he focuses on the strange and fascinating story of how Mayan characters came to be understood.  Ironically, that decipherment transformed the Maya, once thought to be unusually peace-loving, into one the most vicious and violent of all ancient cultures, one delighting in torture and human sacrifice.  Echoing this transformation of the Maya, Coe does not romanticize the scholars who worked at the decipherment.  He notes their genius and stupidity, generosity and arrogance, and he bestows praise and settles scores in the process.  As a historian who is sometimes questioned by undergraduates about the study of anthropology and archaeology, I now have a book to recommend.  &quot;Ask yourself,&quot; I will say, &quot;whether you're ready to commit your life to this sort of intellectual environment, with all the intellectual excitement and pettiness displayed here.&quot;  After reading this book, those students who are willing will know.	2002-02-25

His story is a moving one, and rarely does he lapse into triviality or maudlin sentiment. Many descriptive passages are beautifully written--all the more remarkable because, of course, Samuel's first language is not English.  I came away from the book liking the boy Wolfgang and believing that we could have been childhood friends.<br />There are two subtexts of this book that need to be mentioned.  First, the book is a celebration of capitalism and a condemnation of socialism in both its Nazi and Soviet incarnations.  Second, (a theme that Samuel would probably reject) the book demonstrates the immeasurable consequences that sexual immorality can have on the lives of children--the immorality of Samuel's father certainly, but that of his mother (whom he idolizes) as well.<br />Samuel's book deserves a wide audience.  However, if the book does gain a measure of success, more questions may be asked about the reliability of the author's \\"pictures of life and death...carried in the vault of [his] memory, unchanged by time.\\"  Imagine the two most traumatic events in your childhood between the ages of ten and fifteen, and then try to fill in the space between them with accurate description.

(LOC cataloged it in the Dewey system as 340.092, near books like Legal Realism at Yale.) It's actually the autobiography of Bonnie Poitras Tucker, born (so far as anyone can tell) totally deaf but who eventually became a lawyer and a law school professor. Tucker's strength is in communicating the burden of being deaf even for a gifted lip reader. I must say that I never thought about how terrifying darkness must be for the deaf, how much it would hurt to be thought rude because one couldn't hear everyday sounds or conversation, or even how a moustache might completely frustrate a lip reader. Tucker's reluctance to tell others about her handicap undoubtedly made some periods of her life more difficult than they might have been otherwise, but it takes little imagination for the reader to sympathize with her desire to be \\"normal.\\" Curiously, although Tucker, is an expert on the law of disabilities, her book does not address legal issues in any rigorous way. For her, it is a self-evident truth that a theater owner should provide a seat for her interpreter at no charge. Likewise, the brief attempt she makes at discussing her religious beliefs (basically none) is more simplistic than one would expect from a law school teacher. Nevertheless, the book is worth reading. As a teacher who has had a number of deaf students over the years, I will certainly think twice before regrowing my moustache.	2001-08-28

Snedens prose is more than adequate, and his illustrations are often fascinating.  The editors have also done their job well, and they play fair with the reader by pointing out Sneden's errors and lapses of memory where evidence survives.<br />Nevertheless, this nicely produced volume left me cold, largely because of the personality of the author.  What is one to make of a fellow who criticizes grave robbers and then uses an infants skull as a soap dish or denounces those who collaborate with the enemy and then does so himself?  The English language has a number of unpleasant words for this sort of behavior.<br />I dont trust Sneden.  In this memoir posing as a diary, the author exhibits remarkable foresight about the outcome of events.  Given the proven errors of the manuscript as well as the authors plagiarism of published sources, readers should retain a good deal of skepticism about the authors prophetic powers.<br />Finally, Snedens prose is emotionally flat.  He can describe battlefield carnage with the appropriate words, but he seems strangely detached from the event.  At the conclusion of battles, his first thought seems to be rousting up a meal, and hes not embarrassed to tell the reader so.  If Sneden ever mourned a friend, I missed it.  In fact, one wonders whether he had any friends.  Snedens invective against the enemy also seems conventional and hackneyed.  What Sneden seems to have believed in his heart of hearts was that he was superior to the ordinary run of mortals, soldier or officer, Union or Confederate.  That would explain why, despite gifts as both a writer and an illustrator, Snedens post-war existence is traced largely through querulous letters about his pension and why this manuscript lay forgotten so long until its spiritual deadness became modern.	2001-07-29

James Loewen's Lies Across America is worth reading if for no other reason than that it stimulates critical thinking about the points of view represented at historical sites and monuments.  Furthermore, unlike most academic commentators on the Left, Loewen writes wittily and well.  Indeed, some of his most amusing examples have no ideological slant at all, like the Indian massacre that never happened, the airship that never flew, and the birthplace cabin of Abraham Lincoln constructed thirty years after his death.<br />Nevertheless, Loewen's book has serious flaws.  In part they are the product of Loewen's political and social views, in part they derive from his lack of historical perspective.<br />Some errors are simply \\"nonsense on stilts,\\" the sort of academic pretentiousness that pretends to make telling points while it actually says nothing much at all.  A good example is Loewen's allegation that Europeans are always found at the apex of historical sculpture.  In fact, the triangular form is aesthetically pleasing, and it would have been inconceivable for an artist commissioned to sculpt a statue of Theodore Roosevelt to have put him anywhere but at the top of the triangle.  Loewen also makes no allowance for artistic license.  If the tail or muscles of a horse are not strictly representational, these attributes do not reflect the sculptor's artistic style but some political message.<br />Another theory that sounds impressive is Loewen's proposition that more accurate history can often be written when the history is closer to the present.  Monuments and markers erected after the historical actors die \\"usually go up to serve the political exigencies of the time of their erection.\\"(38) Unfortunately most of Loewen's examples run counter to this theory.  Former Confederates were very much alive when monuments to the Lost Cause started going up around the South.  Memorials to white southerners who supported the rights of freedmen during Reconstruction have had to wait until the recent past.  Some of Loewen's \\"lies\\" were being revised (sometimes into new ones) while he was writing the book.<br />More importantly, Loewen's constant stress on racism begs the question of why turn-of-the-twentieth-century Americans of the most educated classes accepted racism almost unthinkingly.  The answer, of course, is that racism marched hand-in-hand with the rise of Darwinism.  In the view of most educated Americans of the period, Euro-Americans had reached a higher level of evolution than had non-whites, an assertion endorsed by virtually all contemporary scientists.  The myth of Columbus and the flat-earth (treated in Loewen's book as example of chauvinism) grew in popularity for the same reason: to demonstrate the eternal (though, in fact, mythical) conflict between science and religion.  If, however, Loewen had pointed up the irrationality of past intellectuals, the reader might have been led to question the presuppositions of modern intellectuals, perhaps even Loewen himself.<br />Sometimes Loewen has to ignore, or skip lightly over, contrary evidence because the individual or event in question has a less black-and-white interpretation than a book about \\"lies\\" can accommodate.  For example, Loewen's treatment of the atomic bombing of Japan rigorously follows New Leftist scholarship without even a hint that reputable historians (among whom are David McCullough and Stephen Ambrose) hold opposing views.  Loewen also suggests that John Brown was written down as a madman only because of late nineteenth century racism, that \\"he went insane during the nadir of race relations, 1890-1925.\\" (392) But Loewen has to ignore Brown's actual mental processes--which were unusual to say the least--as well as his execution-style murder of five pro-slavers by broad sword.  Both Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee thought Brown was crazy.<br />In other cases, Loewen's sense of evidence is casual at best.  Loewen charges that geographical features such as Devil's Lake and Devil's Tower were given those names as \\"deliberate attempts to stigmatize the religions of Native Americans.\\"  Not one etymological example is given.  Likewise, the reader is puzzled at Loewen's assertion that if a local historian and other residents of the town of Alba, Texas \\"believe that their town was named `white' because it was intended solely for whites, then for all intents and purposes it was.\\"(185)<br />Loewen's view of how accurate history might be conveyed to the public is sometimes otherworldly.  For instance, he seriously argues that the Union League Club of New York should itself post a marker on its building \\"telling how the elite turned their backs on the rights of all man in favor of promoting the privileges of the rich.\\" (402) Loewen also advocates telling visitors to the homes of Willa Cather and James Buchanan that they were gay, then criticizes Buchanan for his pro-slavery views and Cather for her belief that women were inferior to men.  Yet presumably Loewen would be offended if Buchanan's pro-slavery views were regularly interpreted as being related to his homosexuality-which it was.  (I predict that Loewen's proposed changes will be made at about the same time that at Martin Luther King's childhood home it is regularly and solemnly declared that King cheated on his papers and on his wife.)<br />Finally, there is considerable tension between Loewen's populism-\\"we the people have the power to take back the landscape and make it ours\\"-and the realist view that revolutions in historical markers could produce counterrevolutions with deep popular support.  So at the end of the book, Loewen produces a list of \\"Twenty Candidates for `Toppling'\\" but remains of two minds about how literal this toppling should be.<br />Read and enjoy Lies Across America.

Dallimore stresses Irving's great gifts and even empathizes with the eccentricities of character that propelled Irving from the pinnacle of success as a London clergyman of the 1820s to ridicule as a fanatic, a charlatan, and even a madman before his premature death in 1834.<br />Irving seems to have been a man hard to dislike.  His longtime friend, Thomas Carlyle called him \\"the freest, brotherliest, bravest human soul mine ever came in contact with.\\"  Yet an instability of temperament led Irving to endorse charismatic gifts such as prophecy, healing, and speaking in tongues; and support of these gifts ended with Irving's virtual subservience to their practitioners and thus to the virtual destruction of his ministry.<br />Besides providing a portrait of a nearly forgotten preacher of the early nineteenth century, Dallimore employes Irving's instability to demonstrate the weakness of the modern charismatic movement.  To my mind, his admonition to modern charismatics is sound, although they will undoubtedly disagree.  Secular historians will also wonder if Dallimore's frankly stated theological agenda can coexist with the writing of unbiased history.<br />My own most serious criticism of the biography is that in his decision to treat Irving as \\"the fore-runner of the charismatic movement,\\" Dallimore has brushed lightly over Irving's other claim to theological importance, his emphasis on premillenialist eschatology, an important component of modern Protestant fundamentalism.  Reviewers are rightfully warned not to criticize a book that the author has not written.  Still, it is unfortunate that an author of Dallimore's abilities did not fill this void in what is likely to remain a standard biography of Edward Irving for some time to come.id not fill this void in what is likely to remain a standard biography of Edward Irving for some time to come.	2001-06-11

Joan Zenzen has done a fine job of researching and writing this administrative history of Manassas National Battlefield Park.  She has not only made sense of the paper records that flourish luxuriantly around government agencies, but she has also interviewed key players on both sides of the more recent of the many controversies that have swirled around the park.  Zenzen's prose is serviceable if unexciting.  A heavier editorial hand might have reduced the number of awkward phrasings and passive voices.  Still, in literary style it ranks in the top five percent of National Park Service administrative histories, a notoriously pedestrian genre.  A more serious criticism is that the book does not compare the land-use controversies at Manassas with those at other American historic sites, at least beyond limited analogies to Gettysburg and Fredericksburg/Spotsylvania.  Perhaps that is just as well.  Because it lies just outside the Beltway in an area inhabited by the rich, famous, and the politically potent, Manassas is hardly a reliable model for what might happen in similar circumstances at other American battlefields.	2000-12-27

Although  here and there I mentally reworked a sentence, Edgar's style is so superior  to that of most academics that this is more a quibble than a criticism.<br />Likewise, I defer to Dr. Edgar's expertise in his choice of emphases,  although I suppose every South Carolinian will second guess them.  For  instance, the politics of the proprietary era are still mystery to me, and  I don't understand why Edgar devotes so much space to them when say, in the  modern period, the arrival of air conditioning and Bob Jones University are  ignored.<br />Nevertheless, I appreciate Dr. Edgar's work.  It is a solid  history well planned and executed.	2000-01-11

Rosenzweig and Thelenpurport to give us good news about the historical consciousness of the American people, finding that most Americans are, in some way, &quot;connected to the past.&quot; They do this by defining down the definition of history to mean things like talking with relatives, keeping a diary, collecting antique motorcycles, and even attending Bible classes.  History teachers become the heavies because they insist that students regurgitate historical facts about which average Americans express a profound lack of interest (although paradoxically they also say that they would like their children to have the same experience).<br />It's as if those who bemoaned the mathematical illiteracy of the American public were suddenly challenged by a survey noting that virtually all Americans could read house numbers, tell the time, and make change while using a calculator.  These hypothetical respondents would probably also criticize their teachers for burdening them with irrelevant information.<br />Because the majority of the Americans surveyed for Presence of the Past have little sense of history outside their family or group, their knowledge of broader history is both sketchy and distorted.  Rosenzweig and Thelen celebrate the fact that Americans put more trust in museums than in books for their knowledge of history, but such a faith only demonstrates naivete about museums.  (In the wake of the Enola Gay fiasco at the Smithsonian and a subsequent symposium of articles in the Journal of American History, one JAH reader noted that the &quot;true tragedy&quot; was that &quot;both sides believed that the people who saw the exhibit would be swayed, unquestioningly, by the 'facts' presented to them and that the visitors would not stop, even briefly, to think of possible biases in the exhibition itself, let alone about WWII-i.e. that they would think critically. Unfortunately, because of the state of education in this country, I agree with them.&quot;)<br />Using such a low common denominator to define history also reveals that those with the most congruent view of the past are &quot;evangelicals&quot; (defined by Rosenzweig and Thelen as Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses as well as Protestant fundamentalists and evangelicals).  Thelen notes that the appeal of evangelical religion is so powerful &quot;that it seems the most likely common ground on which some respondents from different cultures can recognize each other.&quot; &quot;What,&quot; asks Rosenzweig, &quot;does a largely secular group like historians have to say to them?&quot;<br />The authors' greatest fear is that the &quot;privatized and parochial past&quot; of their informants will not support history as &quot;a vehicle for social justice&quot; or inspire people &quot;to work for social change in the present.&quot; Not to worry.  Ignorance, parochialism, and naivete are a fertile soil for those who wish to use &quot;history&quot; as a tool to promote social and political agendas. &quot;Black Athena&quot; and its kin are only a recent example.<br />Awareness of one's own past is helpful (we often call it maturity), and extending understanding of the past to the lives of one's relatives is even better.  But without an appreciation of the broader past, democracy is in danger.  Much of what passes for present truth is, in the words of C. S. Lewis, &quot;merely temporary fashion.  A man who has lived in many places is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village: the scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune from the great cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age.&quot;ÿately, because of the state of education in this country, I agree with them.&quot;)<br />Using such a low common denominator to define history also reveals that those with the most congruent view of the past are &quot;evangelicals&quot; (defined by Rosenzweig and Thelen as Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses as well as Protestant fundamentalists and evangelicals).

Nevertheless, he lacks sufficient interest in the  political world that has molded the NPS.  (Disinterest in the public  reaction to the 1988 Yellowstone fire is one indicator.)  Had Mather,  Albright, and the other founders of the Park Service not promoted tourism  in their day, there would be less, not more, park ecology for  &quot;dedicated scientists&quot; to manipulate in our own.  As the author  himself says, national park development is locked with preservation in a  state of perpetual tension (181). May that tension long continue.	1999-10-26

Lee: A Biography	Books	3	94	99	N	N	Well written but overly speculative	Because I spent three summers at Arlington House as a National Park Service ranger, I've read a number of books about Robert E. Lee and his family, including Freeman's four volumes twice.  Thomas's biography is well  written and was especially helpful to me in sorting out aspects of Lee's  pre-Civil War career that hadn't made sense to me before.  Thomas'  treatment of Lee's feckless father, Light Horse Harry, hits close to the  mark, and I'm ready to accept Mrs. Lee as more small-minded than I would  have credited ten years ago.  Thomas is perhaps a bit tough on Lee's  father-in-law, G.W.P. Custis, and I would have liked the author to spend  more time with Lee's mother-in-law, Mary Fitzhugh Custis, whose influence  on Lee and his family was enormous.<br />Thomas' attempt to read  double-entendres into Lee's early pleasantries with younger women is at  best strained and at worse anachronistic. Thomas also has an imperfect  understanding of evangelical religion in the nineteenth century and seems  to think if the low-church Episcopalian Lee didn't discuss a conversion  experience, then his confirmation in the church at age 46 was little more  than a formality \\"to support his daughters' conviction\\" and \\"to honor his  mother-in-law's piety.\\"  Thomas' attempt to substitute \\"God\\" for \\"true  gentleman\\" in one of Lee's ruminations about ethics and read into it an  \\"intriguing theological insight\\" is downright silly. (p. 397)<br />One serious  mistake needs to be corrected: the sensational charge that in June 1862,  Lee was so preoccupied with his duties that he forgot his grandson had died  and wrote to the boy's mother asking her to \\"kiss [him] for me.\\"  Thomas  might have reflected on the improbability of this story and double-checked  the primary sources.  Actually, the boy died in July.  It is a notorious  example of information both true and sensational-but with the sensational  untrue and the true not sensational.<br />Lee was not, of course, the myth  that he started to become by the end of the Civil War, and Thomas is  correct to emphasize Lee as a tragic hero.  Nevertheless, Freeman's Lee,  the uncomplicated man of duty is closer to the truth than Thomas' paradox  striving \\"to be independent, to be free.\\"arted to become by the end of the Civil War, and Thomas is  correct to emphasize Lee as a tragic hero.  Nevertheless, Freeman's Lee,  the uncomplicated man of duty is closer to the truth than Thomas' paradox  striving \\"to be independent, to be free.\\"	1998-11-27
