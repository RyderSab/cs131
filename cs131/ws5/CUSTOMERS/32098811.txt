I dont think I will need another book! <br /> <br />I talks about the culture, the food, the history, where to stay, night life, museums, history, logistics, prices, everything. The authors really know teh city well! You can see why it is one of the top companies.	2005-01-30

I have never been to Venice, but I am thinking about going this year. This book made me want to go immediately! <br /> <br />To tell the truth, I can't say if the places that are recommended are good or not. But the writin is very good and the background is good. I cant imagine the information isnt right. When I do go to Venezia (as they say in Italian) I will have this book under my arm!	2005-01-20

The characters are pretty 2 dimensional except for the main two. What is ironic is that they are homosexual (this is not one of the spoilers) and that issue has become a big deal because of the Cheneys daughter. I wonder what was going through her mind when she wrote it.	2004-10-21

But we got an advanced copy at the library and before putting it on the shelf I decide to look through it, because I remember when all this Long Island Lolita stuff happened and because tehre has been a lot of fuss. I couldnt put it down! It was a very good read, and also honest and self critical when it is right. A real good effort, all things considering. If you remember when Joey B and Amy had their coming out party in 1991 you will be interested in this. <br /> <br />Sorry if you were waiting for this at the library. I put it back now. <br /> <br />Can you believe little Amy Fisher is 30 years old??!? Does that make anyone else feel old?	2004-09-29

Or why wasn't it saved for next yr? It is because in advertsing timing is everything and the timing was right for this advertising campaign for the president. <br /> <br />I just read the book and it was pretty interesting in parts and it does make me wonder some things about Sen. Kerry. But I am troubled by the fact that none of these men served with Kerry in Vietnam, and I am very troubled by the fact that it's a direct attack on a man and not something aimed at getting to the truth (even the critical books by folks like Clarke and Woodward were mostly objective in their views). Shame on this Regnery Press who published this. You can see why it wasn't publihed by anyone you've ever heard of.	2004-08-18

I heard it lacked direction and that it needs to be edited better to make it arrive better to the point, but I thought it was a fascinating look at an importnat part of our countrys history.

You know, people said it was liberal propaganda, that it was irresponsible journalism, etc. But when I read it it I was surprised to find that it is very balanced. Most of the points it makes are done very fairly, explaining thebackground of them and other possible explinations.<br />One is the famous point about whether the Saudi Arabians agreed to sell oil at a cheap price before the elections. I heard people criticizing this on television, a wellknown Republican defending against these idea, and the candidate John Kerry using them in a speach. But when you actually read them, it's not such a big deal as all that.<br />I have not read all of the political books of the season, but this one seems nicely balanced to me.

We just got this in and I read it (most of it, because I skipped a few parts) and boy is it bad. The author Michael Bergin isn't the smartest guy around, but that isn't the real problem. The main problem is that the book doesn't have a point (except maybe to get money). He is a guy that Carolyn Bisset had a few dates with, who she trusted on some points and then kept in the dark when she started going out with John John ... big deal. He was her boy toy, a good looking guy she could never be content with. And now that his modeling career is finished, he betrays a dead woman's trust to make a few bucks. Just terrible!	2004-03-31

How many people that write reviews about this book have read it??? It is not a bullitin board for discussions about what is happening in current events ... reviewers, you should talk about the book and not something else.<br />If I go back to the book now, which is reason for concern. I love to read about current events and this is the best summary I know of everything that has to do with Iraq and the war there. It is only one chapter that talks about the Bush administration, but it is very concise and well explained. It explains why the attacks against Mr. Clarke are against him since it would be very hard to attack the facts he presents.<br />Don't forget he is critical of the actions of Clinton and the other pres. Bush as well. Blame is not so easy to assign.	2004-03-27

It is not only for people who loved the movie, but even those who were saddened by it. <br />The photography is so beautiful and so detailed, you might think for a minutes that you are looking at photos of the real thing! It is a beautiful done book about a very powerful movie.	2004-03-15

Evil is behind everything we don't like, like terrorism and the democratic party. Why didn't anyone think of this before? It seems so simple once somebody points it out!<br />Seriously, even though I am not a great intellectual and I dont have predictable politcail view (mixed views, I mean. I have mixed view), I have say that this book was insulting to me. These arguments simplify everything so much that they seem to be written for children (or maybe for adults who think like they are children). Teh fact that it is so successful makes me think there are either a lot of children buying this kind of book or (oh my God) so many adults who still have the intellectual background of children!	2004-03-12

What is next? The Wonderful Author? That is what I think author Anne Tyler is after reading this book.

I have read that there are certain inaccuracies, but that did not bother because I know this is fiction. If I want to learn about the real thing I will geta  text book! The games (mind twisters) at the end are kind of silly, so I gave only four stars. But really and honestly, this is a book that you will keep reading.

I saw this guy on the TV and he made some good points and so I bought the book. It is scarier than the worst horror story! If this stuff is true it is horrible!

Do you ever get that feeling?<br />Anyway, you can read in in less than 100 minutes (I timed it) and so I can now report that it is a good book but not as good as I remember. I found it kinda predictable, and it's not because I read it before. <br />My conclusion: four stars is pretty good, but it will probably make a better impression on someone young than on someone older.	2003-06-16

I cannot say if this is true or not, but I can say that every recommended restaurant I visited (there were four of them) was very good, a step above other restaurants that we happened to stop into. <br />     I not criticize anyone, but if you are visiting Rome for only a few days or even weeks, there are plenty of good restaurants to try here. Maybe some were left out, but more than enough were left in. I think you would have to be in Rome for a very long time to miss the others.<br />     It is a good book.
