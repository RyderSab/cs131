Great book, one complaint	First of all, thank you to Melvin from Pa for offering the updated information on how to contact Wade and for a great review. <br /> <br />Secondly, Wall Street Money Machine VOL 2 is a great book. I have been following these strategies through August and made some nice gains. In particular, using the tandem plays has been very effective for me. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that toll free number that is listed in the book. CAUTION: This is an old number and is no longer a link to Wade Cook's company. Instead, it is a link to one of Wade's competitor's and based on a brief conversation that I had, one that needs to be avoided. <br /> <br />And Melvin, I contacted my local bookstore and they h ave Wade's newest book in stock and I am on my way now to pick it up. Thanks for recommending it! <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

And by far, Rolling Stocks by Gregory Witt is the best guide on how to profitably use Rolling Stocks. <br /> <br />Some people I have talked with have been dissappointed trying to play rolling stocks but in every case I have found that they picked the wrong stocks. They felt that since all stocks move up and down, just buy a stock on a dip and ride it up. Doesn't work that way. <br /> <br />Gregory Witt offers successful strategies on how to profitably, I repeat, profitably play rolling stocks. Witt makes several points that are worth repeating: <br /> <br />1) Rolling Stocks are more commonly found in the lower price <br />   ranges <br /> <br />2) Lower priced stocks roll faster <br /> <br />3) Lower priced stocks have greater percentage increases <br /> <br />4) Rolling stocks tend to emerge after a stock has fallen from <br />   a higher price level <br /> <br />5) Rolling stocks have a tendency to go up after they finish <br />   rolling <br /> <br />6) Rolling stocks tend to have predictive stochastics <br /> <br />7) Rolling stocks are less likely to be found in large,  <br />   profitable companies <br /> <br />Rolling Stocks shows you both how to play rolling stocks and where to find them. Another place to find them is at [...] <br /> <br />Highly recommend Rolling Stocks for anyone who wants to learn how to cash flow the stock market. Additional i nformation can be found in Wall Street Money Machine VOL 1 and Wade Cook's Stock Picking Handbook.	2004-08-31

This book was recommended to me by a friend who used these techniques back during the first Clinton bear market in July 1998 and then again during the second Clinton bear market and longest bear market in history (thanks Bill) in March of 2000. The advice in Bear Market Baloney saved my friends a ton of money. <br /> <br />I picked this book up about a month ago and started applying the advice during the summer months, especially August and it worked. If John Kerry wins the election (God Forbid), this book will be my Bible for what is probably going to be another Clintonesque Bear market. <br /> <br />Wade explains strategies to be used while the market is going down or choppy as it is right now and without shorting the market which is typically the only known strategy for a Bear Market. You won't find wimpy strategies like moving into cash and out of equities either. That may be safe, but a ship at harbor is safe and like cash is going nowhere. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Bear Market Baloney which is in book stores right now. Just disregard the toll free number in the back of the book, this no longer get's you connected to Wade or his people. Instead, go to [...] <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

In particular, it shows just how inaccurate the media can and usually is.    You'll find that the comments about Bush not being too bright are ridiculous and unfounded.

Having been trashed to death with all of the ridiculous Bush-bashing books that came out earlier this year, what a refreshing change it is to read a book that is actually based on facts, not opinion. A book that is well researched and a book that tells the truth about a great man and a great President. <br /> <br />A Matter of Character is must reading for all Americans, especially those seeking the truth about our President, not just opinion, if not flat out lies like in the anti-Bush books. <br /> <br />The world of politics seems to be getting uglier and uglier. In 2000, we had Al Gores \\"win at any cost\\" agenda. Now we have some new opponents to President Bush who feel that \\"if we can't find any dirt on the guy, let's create some.\\" Whatever happened to who is the best man for the job?

Employees always pay the absolute most in taxes. So Phillips is correct in his analysis but deserves jeers for not mentioning how the average income earner can reduce by 50%-100% his taxes.<br />The other thing that ticked me off is that Phillips again conveniently forgets to mention that the Asians have achieved great wealth in terms of net worth by saving 30% of their income while Americans save less than 5% even though their incomes are higher than the Asians. Could this be part of the problem why so many Americans are falling behind?<br />The wealthy also save or invest a major portion of their income. I know some broke people who always say; &quot;Well if I was rich, I would save or invest too!&quot; I don't know about that! What I see is more and more people  spending money on their extravagant lifestyles, living beyond their means. If they made more, they would spend more.<br />Why 2 stars? Phillips did I believe an above average job of researching historical data for this tome and is a good writer. However, he sends out the wrong message and leaves out way too much fact. He even takes a poke at the still best selling book &quot;The Millionaire Next Door.&quot; Interesting is that the people covered in that book became millionaires in the same country and under the same conditions that Phillips insists only benefits the ultra wealthy. Well, once again, these people, just like the ultra wealthy, became rich by taking advantage of the opportunities available in America. Also interesting is that oneof the top producers of millionaires in the late 80's and early 90's was dry cleaning! I couldn't think of a more dull business to start but now wish I had!<br />People should walk away from Wealth &amp; Democracy (and any other book by Phillips) and read quality, fact filled books on building wealth like The Millionaire Next Door, The Automatic Millionaire, The Millionaire Mind and Rich Dad Poor Dad.<br />I also found it interesting that while Kevin Phillips was promoting this book, he was on late nite tv talk shows that were aired right beside the &quot;get rich quick&quot; informercials. The only difference between Phillips and those get rich quick  informercial guru's is that occasionally somebody makes money on one of those get rich quick schemes. I have yet to hear of anyone who has made any money (save book distributors) following Kevin Phillips. <br />Democrats will probably like this book, but then again, look at their track record. Sen John Kerry says he has a plan to help social security but refuses to contribute to it himself. Instead he gets one of these super retirement plans that will pay him a million dollars even though he doesn't have to contribute a dime to it. No senators or congressman do. Meanwhile average people like you and I have to contribute to social security, will get a small smidget of a return (if it is still around) while these guys get a  million dollar gift and pay nothing! Now there is an issue about inequality that Phillips should address.	2004-07-02

Well let me clue you in, that is only a half truth. The government does give great tax breaks, but what these bastions of misinformation fail to say, that anyone can take advanatage of tax breaks. Anyone from a minimum wage employee to the ultra wealthy.<br />Ayn Rand makes a strong case for the problems associated with high taxes. While this is not a personal finance book, it does drive home the folly of overtaxing the rich. What too many people fail to realize is that even if you are broke right now, you can start a small home based business and reduce your taxes from 50%-100%---in short, everybody has the same advantages, if only they will take advantage of them.<br />That said, I have to admit that when I first read this book, I didn't agree with it  either. I was from the old pay your taxes is your duty and taking advantage of tax breaks was illegal or immoral. <br />Ayn Rand is uniquely qualified to   sahre her thoughts in Atlas Shrugged. Readers  may be surprised to know that Miss Rand also wrote four non-fiction books on subjects like objectivism and capitalism. I found the ideas in Atlas Shrugged as well as Rand's other book's both stimulating and timeless. <br />If you are new to Ayn Rand, I suggest that you read Atlas Shrugged first then move on to her other books. Create a new philosophy. Keep an open mind and these books may very well change you life!	2004-07-02

My problems started with the death of several loved ones----8 close relatives  died in a space of 2 months. Then my spouse of 17 years walked out on me shortly after hearing that I had been downsized (laid off, fired, re-engineered or   whatever) due to a hostile takeover of my company that I worked for. Shortly after, just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, my car was repossessed and my ex-spouse was able to take claim of our house.<br />About this time a good friend suggested that I read The Bible for inspiration and guidance and I took his advice. I also started going back to church, in fact I started going everyday. Then a fellow parishioner suggested this book by Rick Warren to me. <br />Just like my life had been like a snowball going downhill at high speed before, now it had all turned around for me. I found a job, met a really nice lady and even started volunteering my time in the evenings for United Way.<br />I don't think that I could pinpoint 1 thing that did it for me, certaintly reading The Bible was the first and perhaps the catalyst for everything that followed and going to church was certaintly highly beneficial, but this great book by Rick Warren helped me find my purpose in life. I have even bought the tapes and listen to them in the morning while shaving or while I am in my now newer car.<br />The Purpose Driven Life is an OUTSTANDING book and I can't recommend it highly enough. Great book. Must reading. This book can change your life. It did mine.	2004-07-01
