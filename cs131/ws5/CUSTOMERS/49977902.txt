Any horrific novel you write becomes an instant bestseller.  Every horrific thing you write earns you more and more attention.  Now imagine, as Stephen King, you undergo a life altering experience.  The sick, scary stories are no longer inside of you.  You think, for lack of a better description, that you are suffering from writer's block.  The page stays blank.  You fear you've lost the ability to write.  Could something like that ever happen?<BR><BR><BR><BR>It happens to Ian Merchant in David Ryan Long's Christy Award winning novel, Ezekiel's Shadow.  Merchant is a best selling horror novelist who finds salvation through Christianity.  It is not that he suffers from writer's block, as much as he no longer believes the desolate and deranged notions he once believed, and so he can no longer write about them.  Not with passion.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>If not for his amazing wife, Rebecca, this new chapter in the fictional author's life would leave the main character alone to struggle trying to figure out what he's supposed to do with this newly changed life. But the heat is on.  His long time friend and editor is anxious to read the next Merchant manuscript, especially since sales have been down and a new book would re-spark reader interest and generate some revenue.  To make matters worse, someone is stalking the famous author, forcing him to suffer for past sins ... <BR><BR><BR><BR>But this novel is about far more than the horrors of being stalked by an unknown assailant (and hounded by an eager, anxious editor).  David Ryan Long writes the terrifying tale of how lost people can be without knowing they are lost at all.  He scares his readers with a story that is riddled with His truth, and ways.  Good vs. Evil.  Man vs. Himself.  Man vs. Man.  Man vs. Nature.  Betrayal.  It's all in here.<BR><BR><BR><BR>The characters are so well defined that you don't want the story to end.  You care about Ian and Rebecca and their dog, Cain.  You care about what happens in their lives, and in the lives of the other characters involved in the tale.  Long writes about friendships and love.  He writes about restoring faith in a humanity many have given up on.  And he does so, not by preaching, but by using powerful, eloquent and gripping prose.  Ezekiel's Shadow is the kind of engrossing novel that a reader savors page by page.  Next?  I look forward to absorbed in David Ryan Long's, Quinlin's Run.<BR><BR>--Phillip Tomasso III, author of Johnny Blade & Third Ring	2002-10-17

Climbing out of his fast sinking car, Josh sees the shadow of the man who caused the wreck.  Up on the bridge, the shadow gives Josh the \\"thumbs-down\\" sign.  The narrow-minded police insist the accident was just that, an accident.  Perhaps it was a case of road rage, but attempted murder?  Regardless, whoever it is trying to kill Josh, they will not stop until they've succeeded.<BR><BR><BR><BR>What can make life worse than thinking someone is out to murder you?  How about knowing someone is blackmailing you.  Josh's former secretary, the Asian-exotic and erotic beauty, Bell knows more about Josh than Josh's own wife.  For starters, Bell and Josh had an affair.  But more than that, she knows that he accepted kickbacks on the construction of apartments-and safety concerns are always a media issue.  Bell is ready to go public with both secrets, unless Josh can buy her silence by giving her what she wants.<BR><BR><BR><BR>A web of deceit.  A masterminded plan of deception.

The woman, Jan, has three children.  The man, Andy Muldock, is their stepfather.  Muldock had his own family at one time.  His wife left had left him and his kids had been taken away from him.  He had been abusing drugs and had been getting violent with his kids.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>Tempe Crabtree is a deputy in the small town of Bear Creek.  Her daily tasks have her working to keep peace and harmony.   However, Crabtree, as always, gets caught up in an investigation that takes her beyond her daily assignments as a police deputy.  Jan's youngest daughter, Vicky, turns up missing.  Crabtree is assigned the job of locating the missing girl.  Based on Muldock's shady past and some incriminating evidence, it seems more likely that foul play has occurred, rather than the child wandering off and getting lost in the night.<BR><BR><BR><BR>In this particular installment, Crabtree's search for answers, her quest for the truth, cause an enormous amount of turmoil in her recent marriage to area preacher, Hutch.  Crabtree, who is part Native American Yanduchi, allows herself to be open and explore some of the rituals of her ancestry.  Fearing the spiritual methods clash with Christian beliefs, then tension between husband and wife threaten to keep Crabrtee from wholeheartedly hunting down everything it is that she is looking for to ease some of Jan's suffering.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Though each book has been entertaining and fast-paced, to date, Unequally Yoked is my favorite.  It is a little grittier and hard-boiled.  There is more tension.  A knot was in my stomach, chapter after chapter, anxious to see what would happen.

Deadly Omen is the second in a series of Tempe Crabtree mysteries written by the talented Marilyn Meredith.  With a cast of 3-D characters, and a back-woods setting, Meredith proportionately incorporates Native American culture to plots of murder and intrigue.<BR><BR><br />Tempe Crabtree, the deputy of Bear Creek, is part Yanduchi.  In this tale, she has recently married Hutch, the town's Christian pastor.   Despite working in law enforcement and being newly married, Crabtree also is raising her teenage son, Blair.  That's just background.<BR><BR><br />Assigned to keep peace and order at a Native American Pow Wow, Crabtree finds herself dragged into a murder mystery when the body of a candidate for princess turns up along the outskirts of the fairgrounds.  The deceased was more than likely going to win the crown and responsibilities associated with being a Pow Wow princess.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Who would want to kill a young girl, and why?  Though only a deputy, Crabtree can not help but investigate the circumstances behind the heinous crime committed while she was on duty, despite the warnings she receives to back off from the male detectives assigned to solve the case.  Most of the evidence points toward a rowdy young Native American.  The detectives think the case is as simple as open and shut.  So how can Crabtree not get involved when clearly the detectives seem closed minded?  She knows they are not asking the right questions, or talking to the right people.  Sure, Daniel Redwing was drunk at the Pow Wow, and sure, he had an amazing crush on the victim, but would that be enough to motivate him to murder?  And what about the pushy stage-mother of the other princess candidate, did she want her own daughter to win badly enough to kill?  After all, she warned people someone was going to die that day.  How about the crazy old man always feuding with the Native Americans, does it seem likely that he was carrying around a gun during the Pow Wow, but it lost before shootingtook place ... and his lost weapon just happens to be the murder weapon?  And what about the victim's boyfriend?  Everyone thought they were destined to get married.  How many people knew she had broken off their relationship?   And what about the victim herself, what skeletons did she have locked away in a closet?<BR><BR><BR><BR> Engrossing from start to finish.   Like Deadly Trail, Deadly Omen is a character-driven mystery with enough edge to keep it suspenseful and intriguing. Fast-paced and beautifully written, the reader quickly sympathizes and relates to Crabtree and the rest of her family.  It can't easy working as a police officer, so having a newly formed family must only make things more complicated.

With a foreboding sense of utter doom, similar to King's The Stand and McCammon's Swan Song, D.A. Stern has written a tightly woven horrific masterpiece.  It is complex and constant.<BR><br />Los Angeles may be used to rolling blackouts, but the city of angels was not ready for what overcame them.  It came in two waves.  The first started with complete power outages that not only knocked out utilities, but also rendered batteries useless.  The second wave was more of a spiritual power outage, that tore through the hearts and souls of the people, allowing for the propensities toward violence become the norm in most.<BR><br />The bizarre blackouts, spreading across the country in a spiraling fashion have the American people fearing the worst.  The military think it is a biological war that has been initiated by an unknown enemy.  Some think it is the time of the Apocalypse.  There is a gathering of people, the evil with the evil, the good with the good, and at times the good, unsuspecting, with evil.  <BR><br />Stern's novel is a tight, character driven horror novel.  Each chapter reads like a cliffhanger as he moves from one central character to the next.  The pacing is amazingly fast, and terribly frightening.  Forget any supernatural evil, just to realize that people actually have violent tendencies like those illustrated in the novel is beyond scary.  Stern is a powerful storyteller, using crisp dialogue and succinct narrative.  Consider me a Stern fan.<BR><BR>--Phillip Tomasso III, author of Third Ring, Tenth House &amp; Mind Play	2002-01-10

Davidson has creatively created a world parallel to ours and in it are creatures that will give readers nightmares.  The linking of souls from one world to the next, and to those existing in the same worlds, is a hard-hitting theme.  Immortal may have the flavor of Stephen King and Peter Straub's The Talisman, sure, but the story, the setting, the fearful links to anything even remotely possible, is all original.<BR><BR><br />Some one is brutally killing people in the city park and at an adult living home.  An autopsy reveals that deadly spider venom is being used.  Jeremy Wheeler, who on a morning walk, is confronted by a gnome-like creature, is informed that he is a dangerous link between the existing worlds and an array of beings from the parallel universe each want him for their own selfish reasons.<BR><BR><br />Everyone cannot see the nomadic, brilliant blue portals that allow beings from both worlds to cross back and forth.

Well, not in Keith Rommel's impacting debut novel, Spirit of Independence.  Rommel confidently keeps the tables turning in this fantasy-like thriller involving good spirits and bad spirits, but which is which is the persistent question throughout the story.<BR><BR><br />The cast of characters is clever, the plot, intriguing.  Travis Winter was a young soldier, murdered in 1944 during World II.  Winter is now like an angel known as Spirit.  While Navarro, who some might consider the root of all evil-the devil himself-calls on Spirit, pleading for Spirit to listen to his side of the story.  And there is DemAngel, who was once a heavenly angel who preferred the demonic side of existence.  And all of their paths cross when there is an attempted robbery.  Spirit's daughter was the clerk.  Spirit, using his power, steps in to save his daughter's life and chases after one of the fleeing thieves.  When the theif vanishes through some type of mystical portal, Spirit follows and finds himself submerged in the conspiracy of an after-life time.<BR><BR><br />Heaven and hell seem to always have been at opposite ends of the battlefield.

And in case you did not know, people practically kill to find apartments for rent in Manhattan.  However, this novel moves to a different beat.  This is not a murder mystery about someone killing to get a place.  This is the story of a serial killer that murders people who call on his ad for a room to rent.  <BR><br />The individual stories of the characters looking for an apartment would have been enough to make this a surprising and refreshing novel.  Their lives are all so different and interesting.  With Niles adding a serial killer to the plot, it just made the entire story that much more entertaining.<BR><br />With witty and clever scenes, poetic narrative, humor and some insight into the mind of a serial Killer, Chris Niles has written an exciting novel in Hell's Kitchen.  <BR><BR>--Phillip Tomasso III, author of Third Ring &amp; Tenth House	2001-11-30

Sythetic Bi Product may be one of the best books I have read in a long while.  Sparrow L. Patterson tells a disquieting story that is so sad and yet powerful, all you can do is turn pages and turn pages.  You never know where you will wind up as Patterson skillfully leads you along a winding, often frightening, literary road.  The main character, Orleigh, is nothing like your average teenager, or at least as a parent, you hope she is not.  However, looking back on my own teen days I wonder just how many steps away from being in situations like Orleigh's I might have been. And yet, it is hard not to love this young lady and feel for her and just want to reach out and hold her close and protect her from a pathetic society.<BR><BR><br />Orleigh is a confused teenager.  She experiments with drugs.  She is sexually active.  She thinks she might be in love with her best friend Heather. When an estranged mother commits Heather to a psychiatric hospital, Orleigh plans to set her free.  Together they wind up living in a house with a rowdy bunch of jobless, drug using people.  Realizing Heather is a selfish tease, Orleigh finds she is attracted to Mark.  He is a tender young man, physically abused by his father, attracted to Orleigh and likes to wear makeup like the lead singer of the alternative band The Cure.  <BR><BR><br />Reflecting, Orleigh remembers her first relationship with a woman.  A commune accepted her.  They lived as one, a community orgy.   Like happy presence united, they did not approve of dating outside the group.  Orleigh did not approve of the rules.  They even ask her to have their baby.<BR><BR><br />Trying to get Mark away from dealing, Orleigh and he set off on the road.  They live in the car.  They make money anyway they can.  They survive.

Graven Images is the kind of puzzle that has enough pieces to make it challenging, enough pieces to keep you guessing, enough pieces to so that a finished sketch is apparent, but the picture is far from decipherable until the end.  <BR><BR><br />When Cally Jo McCallister is just four years old she witnesses her mother being murdered.  Through intensive therapy sessions she can see the killer's face.  Her artistic ability allows her to sketch the face of the killer.  The murderer is apprehended, before being sent to jail, he dies.   Cally grows up, working part time as a police sketch artist while putting herself through school earning a psychology degree.  When attempts are made on her life, and nightmares from her past once again begin to plague her dreams, Cally questions whether or not the man arrested for murdering her mother was the one responsible. <BR><BR><br />Mehl seems to easily draw up a cast of believable characters.  She manages to make each one real and three-dimensional.  You care about the ones she wants you to care about and are suspicious of those she wants you to spend time wondering about.  Like Alfred Hitchcock, Mehl can deliver a surprisingly unexpected twist and only then does it make complete sense.<BR><BR><br />Having been fortunate enough to read Mehl's novel, Sinner's Song, I knew what I'd be getting myself into when I started reading Graven Images.

Paul Lonardo's first novel is a tightly wound nightmare that unravels in a horrific frenzy.  Lonardo understands how to create believable characters and narrowly pull them through some intense scenes.  The Apostate possesses the feel of a classic horror novel.<br />The Apostate is the story Good v. Evil.  It touches on the Second Coming of Christ and the devil among us.   There is Chris, an orphan adopted into an abusive family.  This boy knows he cannot live another minute and escaping becomes his only option. When he finds himself holed up in the big city of Caldera working for an evil baker, he can only wonder if running again makes sense.  Then there is Julian, who is sent to Caldera to conduct an environmental study.  Julian is plagued by past haunts.  The people he is closest to always seem to wind up dead.  Can his imaginary friend be responsible, or deep down, does Julian know he must be the one killing those around him?  Saney, a psychiatrist who moves her small practice to Caldera, is overwhelmed with patients experiencing bizarre nightmares.  Maybe she lends credibility to the tales because her own reoccurring nightmares of the tree-monster are so intense.  <br />Aside from the fact there are no churches in Caldera, there are harboring under the city streets, millions of vicious rats and perhaps one beast with a few devout followers,  responsible for everything evil taking place in Caldera, New Mexico . . . <br />Lonardo writes crisp narrative and full of genuine dialogue.  Apparent talent allows Lonardo to pace his story with intensifying suspense and a climax that pulls in all the pieces of the mysterious and evil puzzle.  I know Paul Lonardo has more novels in the works.  I, for one, will be looking forward to them . . . and losing a few more nights of sleep.<BR><BR>--Phillip Tomasso III, author of Third Ring &amp; Tenth House	2001-10-26

Diana Barron must have an unparalleled mind when it comes to imagination.  Her first novel, Phatom Feast, in my opinion, is a successful cross of genres.  The book is full of dark and bizarre horror ingredients, while magical fantasy is added to spice up the already hot story.  Topping off this `Feast', is a mystery that kept me turning pages.<br />Everything must start at the beginning.  Phatom Feast is no different.  Barron introduces a line of characters that are each more unique than the next and each with a background more mystifyingly intense then the one before it.  When a house touched by magic seemingly takes over the city-when a jungle explodes into the heart of Hester, New York-when everything was once considered sane and, if not normal, at least explainable . . . <br />Some unknown horror stalks those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves as victims of prey.  If the city streets still resembled paved roads instead of wintry woods full of carnivorous beasts, perhaps escaping with your life might seem more possible.  But when the unexpected is the norm, then . . . good luck finding a sanctuary.<br />Phatom Feast is an almost guaranteed haunting read.  Clever dialogue and creative narrative allow a reader to become absorbed into the story, as if an included character in Diana Barron's story.  From the beginning until the magical end, Barron's novel not only held my interest it demanded my attention.  I will impatiently be awaiting more from this talented writer. <BR><BR>--Phillip Tomasso III, author of Third Ring &amp; Tenth House	2001-10-26
