I have to say that I liked this series conclusion more than the \\"Katie Lapp\\" series conclusion. There's more of the happy ever after side to it and not so many dissappointments. One of the main questions for me was how Lyddie and Jake were going to be told that they were aunt and nephew, and I think that ended quite well. <br />At last, all the secrets are out in the open, there's no more loose ends and pretty much everybody is happy! A perfect ending!	2005-06-22

I think that's the whole point. She is completely unlovable because of many deep secrets and scars, and time away from \\"her perfect world\\" is just what she needed! <br />I did enjoy this book, I would read it again, I am going to buy it when I get the chance. My only suggestion would be: if you're not sure, read it first, then decide if you like it or not.	2005-05-13

We always think of Peter as \\"The great Peter!\\", but he was as human as any of us and this book brings that out in an unforgetable drama.

The Long Winter is the 6th book in the original Little House Series. <br />Life is going good for the Ingalls family out West in the Dakota Territory until a hard winter hits. There's blizzards every few days and the trains are snowed in...with all the food inside them. <br />As people in the town grow more and more hungry, Almanzo Wilder and Cap Garland decide to see if an old rumor is true and set out on a mission in search of wheat.  <br />To stay warm when there is no wood or lumber to burn, the family has to twist hay into hard sticks and burn that instead.  <br /> The fact that people survived when there was little resources to draw from simply intrigued me. It made me appreciate the things that I would take for granted everyday. A good read for any person.	2005-03-15

One man remained behind and he and his new wife become the family's closest friends. <br />Little by little, new people start arriving and making their own homes.

The conditions are horrible, but at least it's money to save up to bring her parents to America as well. <br /> She makes friends, witnesses a few tragedies, and hears that her parents have died. So instead of using the money to bring them to America as she had planned, she uses it to rescue a friend from jail who's been wrongfully accused. <br /> The epilogue is very thorough in telling what happened to everyone in the story. <br />But because I have read a few books that I enjoyed more, I'm giving it a 4 star rating.	2005-03-02

I bought this book when it first came out because it sounded really interesting. It was. <br /> I've been studying about the Salem Witch Trials for awhile now, and this was a neat addition to the collection of info. <br /> It's very realistic, there's only a few things made up, and it hits pretty close to home. <br />For instance, a close friend of the family is being accused of being a witch, her sister's best friend is having the fits that inevitably send someone else to jail, and the author even managed to sneak in a bit of romance. <br />It's very interesting and I'm giving it a 5 star rating.	2005-03-02

I have to say, this was one of the best My Name Is America journals I've read so far.  <br />This book was very sad because so many people die, but it's very true-to-life. <br />The one thing that impressed me as well was the fact that the epilogue was complete. Most of the other ones have sorta, dropped, in the middle and never said what happened to the character. This book never did that. It provided all details and solved all mysteries. <br />Despite it's being so sad, there were parts that were laugh out loud hilarious. These poor soldiers are trying to stay happy in the face of death, and in so doing, manage to make sections of this book a lot of fun to read. <br />5 stars!	2005-03-02

But what happened to all of the people who fought for the king? We almost never hear their story. <br /> You read as a town is split down the middle, friendships are divided, even the schoolhouse becomes segregated. The people who are Patriots are yelling obscene things at the Tories, burning down their houses, even mocking them in church while the service is going on. Her mother is a midwife who even has to decide if she will help mothers who are Patriots. <br /> This is a good book to read about people who were prejudiced and a little unfair.	2005-03-02

Ok, this book was not cool. <br />First of all, it seems like all it consists of is fights and swearing REALLY bad words at each other. There is almost no whales, which I guess is the whole point, but still. <br />All he talks about is his brother this and \\"I wonder what my brother's doing\\" and \\"Sean Michael that\\".  <br />Halfway through the book, they abandon ship because it got frozen in ice, and he sets off walking, and I completely lost the thought of it. I finished it simply because I wanted to see if it got more interesting at the end, but nothing really did. <br />The last complaint I have is about the epilouge. It never really said what happened to him. He married, had kids and then....nothing. Oh yeah, and he finally met up with his brother. <br />It's all about \\"he hates me and I hate him\\", \\"he hit me, so I hit him back\\".   <br />I definitely am glad it was borrowed, I'm not going to buy it, and I do not recommend this to anyone.	2005-02-28

The story of the Ebersol family continues in The Sacrifice. Leah is still angry and hurt at losing the love of her life to her banned sister, Sadie. She's patiently trying to cope with the loss of her mother, raise the 2 young children her mother left behind, court a man that has been in love with her from her childhood, put up with a hard-to-deal-with, grief-stricken father, and still manage to have some fun at the same time.   I have to say, there is a small, but very good twist in the book at the very end and I did not see it coming at all. It totally took on a new meaning for me then.  It's a must read, but I must say, if you haven't first read The Covenant and The Betrayal (in that order), then you won't really catch what's going on.	2005-02-27

I enjoyed every single page of this book! <br /> <br />A pattern I've noticed in these books is that the author will present a \\"deep dark secret\\" but not tell you what it is until the end of the book. I think that's what helps keep the reader glued to it. It's definitely what I enjoy the most.  <br />Often she will throw a twist in the middle or at the end as well. <br />This is the first in the Abram's Daughters Series.

Most of the new Royal Diaries books haven't been that great lately, but I checked it out anyway. <br />I was shocked! This book is so good! The author, Kathryn Lasky, has once again written a diary that I believe is bound to be a best-selling novel. <br />I won't go into the details of the story, since most other reviewers do, but I will say, this has everything. Romance (but not too much), treachery, friendship, sorrow and happy times. <br />A must read!	2005-02-26

This book was very exciting and what was good, I enjoyed. <br />However, there was one thing that I really didn't appreciate. <br />The use of four-letter words is very abundant in this book. Aside from the fact that I hate that anyway, it's not very accurate. To use words like that in those days, even in a journal, meant a severe punishment if you were caught! I don't think that an author would dare take the risk. <br />This is supposed to be a kid's book, but I guess its gotten so course nowadays that bad language can even be used there and not be taken offensively. <br />Parents beware, if you have a no-tolerance policy on language, you might want to read this first before giving it to your children!	2005-02-26

I checked this book out because I'm Austrian and I wanted to read more about my heritage. <br />Even though it was very short, it was an awesome read and I would buy it any time. <br />The epilogue is tragic, but hey, that's what happened.  <br />With regards to it just being about her marriage, that may have been one of the only things exciting in her life and I'm glad the author picked out that subject.  <br /> As to the fact that she writes things like her figure, yellow teeth and stuff like that; royal figures in those days had a much higher standard of elegance and appearance than we would probably realize. Looks were everything to a good first impression to your subjects. I happen to be related to an Austrian baroness, so I know what that's all about. <br />Anyways.

Ok, the story was not the best of the Royal diaries I've ever read, but it wasn't horrible. I got it from the library, read it and ok, a few of the names are confusing. Big deal. I got through it and I would definitely read it again. As to the \\"stupidity of the names\\" as they've been called, hey, let's face it, that's what they named people in 749 A.D. For that matter, read Indian names dating 1500's. <br /> It took me a couple of times to totally get the whole point, but after a few times through it, I picked up on things that I didn't the first time. <br />Give it a chance!!!	2005-02-12

I liked this book because it's true to what many girl's emotions are. Even though she's a Queen, Mary still feels homesickness for Scotland, disgust, yet fear of the Queen Mother of France, and still having happy times with the \\"Queen's Marys\\", 4 other girls in her palace also named Mary. I felt intrigue as she learns that she is being spyed on, and has a \\"war council\\" with the Marys and eventually devises this awesome plan to catch the spy, whoever it happens to be. <br />  <br />A commen misconception I've come across is that this is \\"Bloody Mary\\". It's not. This is in fact, her cousin. <br />This is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it to anyone.	2005-02-11
