I adopted this as a text in my qualitative methods course, and soon found that the treatment of various qualitative methods was overly vauge and confused students about the scope and purpose of qualitative research. In particular, Berg blurs the lines between focus groups, action research, and participant observation. One is left with a sense that all qualitative methods are equal and interchangable. <br />Each chapter alone is well written, but there is a lack of an overarching structure to the book that results in an over-simplification of qualitative methods. I do not plan on utilizing this text for courses again, it is too vauge for beginners and too basic for experts. It is also to general for use as a reference book.	2001-10-11

Levitt offers us a number of interesting insights into the lives of Dominican migrants in the 21st Century. She tells us that the lives of Dominicans in the U.S. and those who remain in their local communities at home are shaped by the transnational experience. This is largely the product of what she refers to as &quot;social remittance.&quot; Levitt also goes into a long discussion of the role that institutions like political parties, the Church, and community development organizations play in this process. In many ways this analysis is a re-cycled version of earlier analyses of immigrants. For instance, Bodner gives us a version of this story in &quot;The Transplanted.&quot; Of course, Levitt attributed this new form of &quot;Transnationalism&quot; to thinks like improvements in technology, communications, transportation, and interpretations of citizenship by governments. For those of us who remember the heyday of modernization theory, much of this sounds familiar, and wanton for a critique focusing on issues of inequality. Although Levitt takes the discussion of Transnationalism further than some of her contemporaries, it remains encumbered by the theoretical limitations of her selected framework.	2001-10-10

However, Conley may be overemphasizing the role of wealth, and forgeting that race is still a critical issues. In fact, his models show that wealth is only a small part of the story. A great deal of the unexplained variance in Conley's models may be attributed to discrimination in society. Although Conley mentions this briefly, more attention needs to focus on this aspect the issue. Nevertheless, the discussions of wealth are rich and well developed, making this an important addition to the literature.	2001-06-03

However, this is a slow process. The authors highlight that the narrowing of the lending gap has come about in response to advocacy at the local and national levels. Despite progress, efforts to improve access to capital in inner-cities are complicated by persistent opposition in policy circles and consolidation in the banking industry. If current trends continue, the outlook for inner cities is bleak, at best it may take in excess of 140 years for blacks and whites to have equal access to capital. However, Squires and O'Conner map out a course for improving the odds. In their chapters they indicate that the solution to the lending problem lies in a combination of: new lending products, mortgage counceling, affirmitive action hiring in banks, the location of more branches in inner city communities, and stronger CRA legislation.	2001-06-03

Her analysis of race, class, gender and neighborhood politics is excellent. We learn that neighorhood context has important ramifications for how local politics are expressed, but still, grassroots activism emerges where inequality is found. The only weakness in this book is the occasional redundancies in the discussion, particularly where latter chapters seem to repeat earlier ones. But, as a book that expands the discussion of both gender and race in the context of urban social movements, this is one of the best. It balances case studies and well developed grounded theory well. Moreover, the book appeals to a broad audience in academic settings and the broader public.	2001-06-03

The main strength of the book is the way it ties the plight of the working poor to the current policy debate. Particularly, the role of wefare reform in American cities. Although she writes before many changes in the social welfare system, she is able to identify issues that are now key. Unfortunately, some of her policy recommendations are not well suited for the setting that she describes. For instance, the recommendation to create employment cooperatives between primary and secondary sector employers seems underdeveloped, and somewhat inpractical. But, this does not detract from the thrust of the work, which identified employment as a central concern in poor communities. This argument represents the end of a long ugly discussion of social pathology in the inner city, and the start of a more productive discussion of poverty as a problem in mainstream America.	2001-06-03

This book treats the emergency food system with fairness and offeres a balanced view of the strengths and weaknesses of the national shift toward in-kind food relief. The author does a wonderful job of exposing the problems with institutionalizing &quot;emergency&quot; food programs, while governmental agencies weaken the safety net for the poor. In addition to excellent ethnographic work, the author adds a number of nuggets of historical data to build context and meaning. A must read for those hungry for explainations as to why government had abandoned the needy and ignored the structural problems that produce what the author terms &quot;food insecurity.&quot;	2001-05-08

Through this book, black neighborhood are transformed into multi-dimensional communities, rich with institutions and networks. Truely a balanced view, which goes beyond books like the Truely Disadvantaged (although both deal with the same community). Most importantly, the author reminds us of the link between structural factors and race. The content of the book should not be overlooked, and the conclusions regarding the need to maintain race-based affirmative action, even for middle class blacks, should influence every policymaker in the country.	2000-10-25

Although it is targeted to grassroots groups, it is often used by people in planning practice. Given the juvinile content of the book, and the limited consideration of current methodological standards and technology, it could result in a marginalization of citizens groups and practical planning efforts directed at them. Why do so many authors of these types of books think that citizens are stupid? Why do so many authors of these types of books think that freehand drawings are common in the urban planning profession? Why do so many authors of these books give examples of bad survey methodology to citizens? Obviously they don't understand that citizens are smart, and they are capable of presenting cogent proposals to public officials.
