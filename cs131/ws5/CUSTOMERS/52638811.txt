Books	2	18	21	N	N	I would give the first 1/3 four stars if I could...	\\"The Skin I'm In\\" is fabulous, but I don't think this lives up to it at all. The first third of Bang! is an excellent evocation of a family and a neighborhood in decline.  <br /> <br />After that, the book itself declines into unbelievable, author-directed silliness. Even if everything that happens to Mann after his father abandons him in the country is taken at face value, I find it impossible to believe that for a whole month no family member and no person in authority thought to look for the boy at the stable where he loved to go daily. A stable that became convienently empty just in time for him to move into it.  <br /> <br />And to call the child Mann when the whole book is about rites of passage into manhood is just ludicrous. The final scenes of supposed redemption between Mann and his father are some of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes I have even read in fiction of any type.  <br /> <br />The many messages of the novel are worthy, but the novel itself is quite flawed.	2005-09-06

I have enjoyed Anne Rice's vampiric, pained aesthetes and Tanya Huff's funny, noble vampires as much as the next reader...but loving the boogeyman or laughing with him gets old after a while. I still love Tanya Huff; don't get me wrong...though I think I have outgrown Rice. I want to be horrified by my horror these days. In this horror show of a world we've been dropped in to, it's...comforting to dwell for a time in a world worse off than our own. <br />I was overjoyed that Wilson (obviously one of my favortie writers if you've seen my other reviews) decided to make vampires scary again. I believe he has succeeded admirably in this page-turning thriller. Vampires have taken over Europe and are now they are sweeping across America...or they're trying to. Life as we know it has ended on the east coast. Roving bands of mortal henchemen calling themselves &quot;Cowboys&quot; hunt during the day for their undead masters. Wilson's vampires are eerie and scary (monsters with enough humanity to magnify their nastiness). Those few who fight both Cowboys and vampires are a great set of characters themselves: Father Cahill and his tough-as-nails niece Lacey. Rabbi Zev and Sister Carole...a seriously scary nun (who used to teach science).<br />The Booklist review above was right to compare this to 28 Days Later. There is a definite similarity. Really the best new take on vampires since...well...The Keep by Frances Paul himself! Why isn't this man on the top of the bestsellers lists? You'll wonder too if you give this or Sims or The Select a try.	2004-05-22

This was short-listed for Hugo and Nebula the year it came out. It's also an excellent introduction to one of the most overlooked authors of our time. Set after the next big war, women live in walled cities. Most men live in barracks outside the cities. When a boy comes of age, he chooses to go through the men's gate and join the armies who fight their battles between barracks or to stay in the city and act a servant to the women. Of course nothing is as it seems. The whole story is played out in alternating chapters... the intervening chapters are pages from the imaginary play &quot;Iphegenia at Illium&quot; which the women perform every festival when the men of the barracks are allowed in to fraternize and further the species...or so they think. Thought-provoking and very well written.	2004-03-06

Dan Simmons seems to be the master of many genres. He's won a World Fantasy Award for his frightening novel &quot;Song of Kali&quot; and Hugo/Nebula for his Hyperion series (science fiction). He's lately written myeteries and thrillers. Here is his take on ghost stories. And boy is it a chiller! Don't read this one alone on a dark night. I kid you not, it had me on edge. Something blew across my roof on a cloudy afternoon while I was reading one of the more creepy passages &amp; I nearly jumped out of my socks. It's the story of a not-so-good writer who takes a sabbatical from teaching (and the wife who has just divorcied him) to return to his childhood home and write about his childhood. Turns out HE is as haunted as the house in question. Give it a try! (Not for the...um...prudish). Start this early on a winter's day because it will keep you reading (and might keep you awake).	2004-03-06

Now it's 2000 and one of their members has disappeared and it seems to be tied to a tide of fundamentalism that is sweeping America. All of Tepper's hallmarks are present: evil machinations of politicians...opression of women--only this time it is made all the more frightening because it seems to occur in our time rather than some far flung future. Not her best work (See Raising the Stones (1984) or The Companions (2003) for her best) but scary and well worth it!	2004-03-06

If you have been reading the Repairman Jack novels, you don't need to read any further...in fact, you are probably already putting this one on hold for yourself or checking it out (if it's on the shelf). If you are new to the series or haven't heard of it yet, this is a good one. Jack's story started in The Tomb way back in 1984. At one point it seemed to have ended (with the world as we know it) in Nightworld in 1992/1993. But Wilson (thankfully!) has decided to go back and fill in the missing years of Jack's life between The Tomb and the beginning of the Nightworld trilogy. This is (I believe) the sixth of those fill in the blank novels. Jack is fix-it man. If someone is blackmailing you, you call Jack to...take the pressure off. He is an &quot;invisible&quot; man. He has no social security number. He looks like your average Joe. But he's an amazing fighter and arms expert. Since The Tomb, though, he has been running in to supernatural problems. It helps to read the books in order, but it's not 100% necessary. In this installment, Jack leaves his beloved New York city (and his near complete anonymity therein) to fly to Florida to check on his Dad who has had a run in with--well, I won't spoil anything, but I will say it is connected to Jack's main adversary &quot;The Otherness&quot; Check out the series if you haven't. Stephen King is the president of the Repairman Jack fan club. If you read one, you'll be a member too!	2004-03-06

This was a favorite book of mine when it came out (I was in junior high when it came out in paperback the first time). It is creepy, full of magic &amp; menace, and quite well written. (As an adult, I did notice a glaring point of view problem in the first part of the book--see if you can find it). It's the story of two boys who become friends at a private school amidst strange goings on. They spend the summer together in New Hampshire with the uncle of one of the boys who happens to be the world's greatest (sinister) magician. This is one of Straub's best to date and probably one of his two or three least known books. Give it a try!	2004-03-06

Meanwhile, the therapist's personal life is falling to pieces. American bestsellers in the genre of your choice are fun reads. Reading a book by an excellent storyteller and writer like Barker points up just how flimsy, vapid, and bland many of those NYT bestsellers are. She has an amazing facillity with language and story construction.

My father read us this book (skipping what he thought were the boring parts) when I was in elementary school. I tried to check it out of the library, but was told I needed adult permission to do so (so glad library policies change!). Being the ever devious fourth grader that I was, I plunked down a quarter at the next library book sale and bought my very own second hand copy. I have read and reread that copy and purchased new ones. I think I have three at present. All this to say that this is one of the all time best novels ever written in the English language. Sweeping adventure, personal struggles, mythology, wars &amp; intrigue and wondrous travelogue all in one. If you have ever let the idea that this book centers on a group of &quot;bunnies&quot; keep you from reading it, put that out of your mind. The characters are based on Adams's military unit and they are quite human. At times frightening and at others laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book you will live as much as read. And when you give it a chance it will sweep you away.	2004-03-06

You will find this in the YA or the Juvenile section but don't let that keep you from reading it. If I could give it 10 stars I would. This National Book Award Winner is one of the best near future sci-fi thriller novels written in the past few years. Early in the novel, Matt discovers he is a clone in a future where clones are thought of as little more than animals. Matt is the clone of a very powerful drug lord, and because of this, he enjoys a much more comfortable life than most. Matt learns a lot in the course of the novel...perhaps the most frightening of these is that there are many reasons for cloning one's self. I hear a lot of people review books and say things like \\"a page turner\\" and \\"you won't want to put it down.\\" I read a lot and usually don't have too much trouble putting a book down if something else catches my eye or if it's late at night. This one kept me up until three a.m. This \\"Newbery Honor\\" is head and shoulders above the winner of the medal for 2003. (Crispin isn't even in  the same league as this book). This is also head and shoulders above most SF books of 2003! Give it a look you won't be sorry!	2004-03-06

If Fantasy is your cup of tea, and you haven't tried Pratchett's Discworld books, pick one in the series and have at it. He was compared to Douglas Adams in the beginning, but I have to say that Pratchett has it all over Adams. Discworld is funnier and more inventive than either Hitchhiker's or Dirk Gently. Describing the premise of the series (life on a flat world riding on the back of four huge elephants who in turn ride on the back of the great sky turtle where magic works...sometimes) or the plot of any given entry in the series (here three witches meddle in the affairs of a kingdom) can not do the books justice. They are sly and witty and, at times, laugh out loud funny. I knew a hugh fan of Wodehouse in Boston who said Pratchett should be allowed to live forever providing he produced one Discworld book a year. He should be paid up for a decoade or more since he's been doubling up the past couple years. You can't go wrong if you are looking for a laugh! And the BBC has produced two of the books as animated series (check them out in Amazon's DVD land Soul Music and this book).	2004-03-06

Keep that in mind...Claire is a Keeper, one of the few of the lineage strong enough to help maintain the balance of good and evil in the world. She follows Summonses to &quot;accident sites&quot; and then she uses her powers to repair the sites. She follows a Summons to the Elysian Fields Guest House and finds it is or rather was run by a Cousin, a less powerful person of the lineage. The Cousin takes a hike leaving Claire to mind...well...A portal to Hell in the basement, a sleeping corrupted Keeper, and a randy ghost of a sailor. But Keepers are only supposed to be tied to one sight when they get OLD, and Claire is far from that. Throw in one of the most realistic anthropomorphic cats (read sarcastic in the extreme) and one hunky maintenance man and a meddling younger sister (who is too powerful for her own good) and you know all Hell will break lose (sorry). Huff's vampire detective series is great, but these are laugh out loud funny. So far there are three (Second Summoning and Long Hot Summoning follow this) and we can only hope for more.

I think it's due in part to an overdose of &quot;Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom&quot; and re-runs of Daktari at a very tender age. But this IS an excellent novel. Preston is one half of the team that wrote &quot;The Relic&quot; and several other great thrillers. this is much more gentle fiction than any of those. It is character and issue driven realistic fiction. Jennie is a chimp who is raised as a human child. The story is told as if it were a true history and the viewpoint is split. There are interviews (using sign language) with Jennie, exerpts from her &quot;father's&quot; book, newspaper articles, and other interviews. The story's flow is surprisingly smooth for all that. At turns funny and heart-breaking, Jennie won't leave you along once you pick this novel up. It's short, but block off some time...it's a page turner. And the denouement, while not surprising (what always happens when the wild enters surburbia?) is all the sadder for its inevitableness.	2004-03-06

The reason for the \\"sudden reordering\\" of the Narnia series dates back to a letter sent to C S Lewis by a child after the completion of the series. The young reader noticed that the books were published out of order as far as the Narnian time line goes with the creation of Narnia occuring in \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (the sixth book published). In the letter, the child asked which order the books should be read in. Lewis replied that it was really up to the reader, but he prefered them chronologically within the Narnian world which places \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" first. SO it is up to the reader whether you want to read them in the new order (approved by the author) or their publication order. Either way you do it, \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" occurs at the same time \\"The Lion and the Witch and the wardrobe\\" occurs. I read them both ways, and LW&W is a better \\"first book\\" because it's more action oriented than MN. It was more interesting for me as a young reader to go back in time and read about the creation of one of my favorite fantasy worlds...every reader might not agree (obviously the publishers and the Lewis family don't).

Devon, raised by a single father, has always been different. \\"Things\\" live in his closet, and he has unreliable \\"powers.\\" His father assures him Devon will always be stronger than the demons that attack him.<br />When his father dies and the Devon learns he was adopted, the 14 year-old is sent to live with strangers at a wickedly spooky house atop a cliff in the aptly named Misery Point. Ravenscliff is the house and all its denizens freely admit it is haunted. Devon learns his past is connected to the house...and the ghosts who have never harmed anyone before start to act up.<br />An excellent addition to the creepy-clown subgenre of horror, this exciting read, while nothing startlingly new, is well worth the time. And the promise of future volumes is a plus. The story does drag a wee bit in places, but this is the author's first for young people (he's written adult novels under another name).<br />This book also has a killer website.

Is there a child in your life who might answer the question \\"What did you do today?\\" by saying \\"Resisted entropy.\\" ?<br />Are you a fan of \\"Raw\\" and would you like your nieces and nephews to grow up like you (to spite your siblings)?<br />Even if you're just looking for a good thought-provoking read, this is a great book to buy...it'll even decorate your coffee table nicely. Ian Falconer (Caldecott Honor author/illustartor of \\"Olivia\\") teams with essayist David Sedaris (that alone should make you hop up to go investigate!) Barbara McClintock, Maurice Sendak, Jules Feiffer--what, you still haven't hit the \\"add to shopping cart\\" button? They all have their pages or stories in this wonderful collection.<br />This is what children's books should be! A brother and sister defeat evil Jack Frost with a hair drier, a young boy gets trapped in a comic book (can you imagine how boring the fights would get after a while?) games...maze-stories in which YOU decide the ending...<br />Excellent no matter your age. And the end papers will teach you to draw comics! Happy Reading!	2002-02-28

I have nothing negative to say about it, so perhaps that means it IS a perfect book. It communicates coolness to the 3rd/4th grade set smashingly. <br />Bobby North starts at a new school and finds the things that were cool at his old school aren't cool in his new environment. So he immitates the coolest kid, skatboarding moose Harry Haller(at first very badly). With practice he gets better and wins the appelation \\"cool.\\" He becomes SO cool he chills completely. <br />Then his coolness is challenged (by warthog Siggy Sidewinder). (Usually the story ends here with the challenged winning out...) And he's so intent on feeling the coolness of his air-grabbing stunt that he plants his face in the shrubs. <br />When Siggy laughs at him the next day at school Bobby & Harry have a little discussion about what coolness is.<br />Sandra Boynton's cooly colored cartoon illustrations are just exactly right: cute without being cutesy. An excellent gift for young skateboard enthusiasts who may or may not love to read. OR an excellent gift for that teenager who is searching for cool.<br />Happy Reading!	2002-02-15

And she can do it while making you think.<br />I got this book as a reviewer's copy (hot on the heels of a book by her husband, I might add). I'd eyed Technogenesis in the book store, but with so much I HAVE to read, I thought I'd never have time. Imagine my delight when one of my journals sent this to me  for a review! Imagine further when I started reading and just couldn't stop. This is an excellent science fiction thriller in a wholely believable future.<br />I can't wait to get Mitchell's first book. Since Sheri Tepper (personal favorite) only writes one a year, I am so dang happy to find someone who hooks me like she does.<br />And eventhough I'm not her husband (Eric Nylund--see above HA! There's the guy to go to for an objective opinion) I too think this is a ripping good read! {His books are great too if you haven't checked them out...um, I like this more...Yipe, sorry again Eric!}<br />Happy Reading!	2002-01-26

Five who kiss each other.\\"<BR>\\"One who sings loud at night.\\" (one of the cats)<BR>\\"One who sings loud in the morning.\\" (Dad)<br />All of her cat-egories (sorry) are just exactly the categories a preschooler would come up with:<br />\\"Four who like to eat fish...two who like to eat mice. Only one who likes to eat beets.\\"<br />And the pictures...perspectively-challenged, muddy pastel-ie montages from Bogacki...are perfect. If you haven't discovered his solo work, seek it out.

It is the first (since Coma) Robin Cook I've read. I read it because I thought he has been at the business of writing for so long, he has to have gotten good at it. And the premise sounded interesting (not shockingly new, mind you...but interesting).<br />I nearly got out my red pen and went after several passages. There are several howlers...all unintentional.<br />The characters ARE irritating and their actions make NO sense. BUT I give this two stars (instead of one or a half) because the plot DID keep me reading until the end. Now that must be worth something!<br />So style is absent. So the characters are ludicrous. So we saw this society in Brave New World and ninety-leven 70's SF movies and 50's SF novels...there is still a spark of something new--albeit a small one. So IF you find yourself on an island, you COULD be stranded with worse. If you have nothing to read at present...believe me you could do worse.	2002-01-15

I don't plan to get an X box (now if someone wants to GIVE me one...). I don't like military science fiction--Starship Troopers was excrutiating! (I had to read it for a class). I am not a fan of FPS games (I like RPGs & survival Horror and weird stuff). And unlike some of my fellow reviewers, I have never heard of Eric Nylund (sorry Eric).<br />Despite all that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read a LOT, and it's rare a book will hang on to me when I have other things to do...this one made me late getting back from lunch because I just had to finish the chapter and kept me up too late, so the kiddies had a tired librarian for storytime.<br />All I'm saying is this is well wrought, fun science fiction. It is WELL worth the tiny price and your time. Comparison to the excellent Hugo/Nebula award-winning Ender's Game is NOT unwarranted. So BUY it already! :-)	2001-12-21

Some of them are pretty stinky, a few of them are perfect...and some are just plain great reads. This is one of this last category.<br />I just finished reading this book for the second time (first time was to review it for School Library Jourrnal). THIS time, I read it to use it with my middle-grade book discussion group &amp; I know the kids will love it.<br />It is spooky. It is full of sly humor. It has history, and it has thrills. Most importantly its narrarator sounds like a REAL kid. His friends and family are real too. Even the ghosts sound (?) authentic. I'm glad Vande Velde has so many books out there. I've only read two...and I'm looking forward to the rest. Your middle grade readers (say 4th to 7th grade) will love this.<br />(I still think the title is a little...odd though) :-) Happy Reading!	2001-12-15

Ryan loves to play soccer (eventhough he might get distracted sometimes on the field)...and his mom loves to go to his games. Unfortunately she's often a little over-enthusiastic. Ryan gets a little embarassed. He cooks up a plan to trick his mom...and then (along with the rest of the team) misses her when he thinks she's not there.<br />This is a great Easy Reader for a good first grade reader or an average second grade reader. ESPECIALLY if they love soccer. <br />Cute &amp; expressive pencil illustrations add to the fun. It even covers the thorny subjects of honesty and (obviously) being embarassed over the actions of a parent in language any second grader can understand.<br />(Soccer Mom's will &quot;aww&quot; at then end...and their little players won't mind!)	2001-12-01

What will she hear today? Who will she greet today? They dance, they jump, they swish and slide...do everything but go slow...because Didi can't!

The SF world is central to the mysteries and how they are solved. The mysteries are well imagined and quite logical. The characters are...well, mostly believable. The aliens are more believable. <br />But this series despite it's high-tech, metaphysical future remains a pale reflection of the author's other SF mystery series. Denise Vitola (the author's real name) has a series of five books about a &quot;werewolf&quot; in a decidedly lower-tech (and more believable) future. Ty really isn't a werewolf, but you'll have to read those superior books to find out why. <br />All that said, if you have finished those five books, these two are not a bad follow up...they just read like an author's first attempt when held up against the others.	2001-11-05

Obviously someone did not read the first book in the series...and has little science fiction reading under her belt--BUT this is about the book!<br />Wayward Moon is a good, fun, light read. So is the first in the series Heart of Stone. The slang can grate at times &amp; the Astrology can overwhelm the story in places BUT the mystery is good and the imagined future is interesting. The aliens are believable if a little Star Trek at times. The best part about the books is that the mysteries the center around belong in the world where the author created them. Neither the SF or the mystery (or the romance for that matter) feels tacked on.<br />That said, the author's OTHER series written under her real name Denise Vitola is far superior. There are five books in that series &amp; I would suggest spending time reading them before these. While waiting for more Vitola books, these will fill the time.	2001-11-05

This prequel/companion to I Am Mordred again deals with Briton's premire dysfunctional family. Morgan resents her half brother Arthur from his birth. He is the offspring of King Uther who murdered her father to sleep with their mother. Arthur is the reason she and her flighty older sister Morgause must flee their castle Tintagel with their nurse who is more than just a nurse. Arthur is the object of their mother's obsession when she goes slightly mad after Uther's death. Morgan tries to fight fate and live a happy life away from the world with her true love Sir Thomas, but she loses the fight, her lover, and for a time her mind. The characterizations, especially Morgan's, are excellent as is the imagery and writing in general. Morgan's complex relationship with Thomas not to mention what is intimated at the tale's end to occur between  siblings Morgause and Arthur push this title firmly on to YA ground unlike it's companion volume. The infusion of figures from mythology is nicely handled too. The author has created a wholely believable world! Worth a look see whether you are an Arthurian tale fan or not. There are draggy bits, but the last thirty-forty pages are wonderful!	2001-05-23

As you read the first couple sentences, you notice it's written in the second person. You decide to give it a try, no matter that you find second person narration  artificial and a little pretentious. You read about a teen named Will who has lost his father and stepmother in an accident that might not have been an accident. Will goes to a special school, you come to understand, because he didn't take their deaths well. You really don't like Will or his Grandparents who are ineffectual. To you they seem like scenery that wrings its hands a lot. You do like his sometimes friend Angela who might be a lesbian since she insists she doesn't date boys. You also like some of the sprung-from-teen-angst observations and wisdom, but you find the slim plot about a string of teen suicides a bit clichd. You are confused when Will starts blaming himself for the suicides. Your confusion is compounded when some of the adults seem to blame him too. You actually spend a few moments wondering if you are just not a skilled enough reader to understand this literary experiment. After finishing the book, you decide that's not the case. You're smart enough, and this is just a choose your own adventure without the fun of the choices.	2001-04-20
US	52638811	R3563FTIMKV9QO	0441007694	496933037	The Coming (Ace Science Fiction)	Books	4	29	35	N	N	Let's be fair here	The one star review is a little unfair and quite unspecific. There are superficial similarities between this book and Contact by Sagan. They do both occur in the near future and they do both concern female astrophysicists who recieve messages from space and run into opposition, but I think the literary world can support two such works. There the similarities do end. Haldeman's future is scarily believable, and as usual deftly sketched out with a minimum of SF flapdoodlery. The focus is on the story and the characters not the era. <br />There are a couple main characters but the book belongs to their supporting cast as much as to Dr. Bell and her music professor husband. One of the most enjoyable parts of this book is its narrative style; all of the characters hand off the narration of the story chapter to chapter. One character comes into contact with another and the point of view character changes. Excellent way to see the world of the book and its characters from all sides. We do get to see the characters warts and all.<br />There are many twists in the story, and none of them ring untrue. Sure you know something's fishy...sure you think one of the characters isn't what he seems, but you don't know what or in what way...until the end, and it is a good surprise ending (but not a total surprise--it's all there and rings true).<br />And the best thing is we don't come to the end (as we did with -the movie- Contact) and find out the aliens are her dead father! What a gyp!) So anyway, this book is much better than the other reviewer would lead you to believe. It is well worth the time. And I will say so in my review which I will now write for a review journal (which shall remain nameless). <br />Go! Read this book. It's Good.	2000-12-23

What a beautiful (and hysterical) book. As a children's librarian, I read a LOT of children's books (most not this much fun). On the giggles scale (the bottom of which is Ivanhoe &amp; the top of which is Captain Underpants) this is a solid Captain Underpants. What first or second grader when faced with a day of school hasn't dreamed of the care-free life of the family dog? Robert McDoodle being no ordinary 5 (almost 6) year old DOES something about attaining that goal. But at Jellicoe Dog School he finds out there's more to being the first Human Pup than chasing sticks and digging in the dirt. The watercolor illustrations are full of energy and a perfect match for the inspired story. My storytimers (K to 3rd grade) love it. I'm sure yours will too (even if they aren't dog people)! Perfect for storytimes when coupled with the song quoted in the title of my review!	2000-09-26

Willhoite's illustrations have always had the cartoony appeal of Kevin Henkes and that helps to make them more calming and sweet. This book is more a pleasant fantasy of how things should be and might be in the future  than it is a realistic depiction of present day gay America.<br />This well  done book is a must for men or women contemplating same-sex marriages who  also have young children. It is the story of a divoriced man who is  re-marrying. He just happens to be marrying another man. It is presentd in  such a way that it doesn't feel like anything too out of the ordinary for  most of the people involved.<br />It doesn't quite live up to the simple,  realistic Daddy's Roommate...but it is an excellent and necessary book!	2000-06-07

I sold books  for six years and am now a Children's Librarian...so I read and have always  read A LOT. Only two books have ever made me cry. <br />This one made me weep.  It is a thing of beauty. The prose is spare and poetic. The characters  breathe from their first appearance. The story is so real, so well handled.  I don't think anyone could read this short novel and come away unaffected.  There is a wonderful network of symbols at work in this book...but you  don't have to analize them in order to enjoy meeting Spoon and his  family...to feel the depth of his relationship with both his  grandparents...and glimpse with him the depth of his grandparent's  relationship with each other.

Katheryn Lasky is an excellent writer, and YAs should read all of her other books. This book, however, is a mess. The author obviously understands and has strong  feelings about the moral implications of cloning. She does not understand  the science of genetics. The book is rife with misconceptions and the worst  kind of pseudoscience. Good science fiction is grounded in science; it is  an extrapolation from what we know today. The characters are flimsy and the  plot is ludicrous. It falls into the all usual traps that SF novels by non  SF readers do. The society of 3038 is exactly like society today. Her characters read the newspaper and watch television in the year 3038! Television and newspapers will change drastically by 2038...they will be unrecognizable by 3038.	2000-05-25
