Finally, after several decades of how-to books on voluntary simplicity, we are beginning to see some studies of the phenomenon. (I hesitate to call it a movement, it doesn't seem quite that organized.) This book and Mary Grigsby's Buying Time and Getting By are an excellent start to what promises to be a very interesting genre.<br /><br />There are some provocative ideas in these essays. For instance, Robert Frank believes we should tax consumption in order to encourage saving. When is the last time you heard anyone encourage saving? Our leaders and financial advisors encourage us to invest and spend, and if the investments we make don't pan out (Enron, Worldcom), well, we knew the risks. Anyone who saves these days, with interest rates near zero, is considered a chump. Yet, at the same time we are supposed to accept the risks of investing and being responsible for our own retirements, some want to dismantle the Social Security System that provides a modest safety net just in case things don't work out.<br /><br />Edward Luttwak in his essay notes that America embraces all the beliefs of Puritanism, even Calvinism, except for one. We value hard work, self-sufficiency, and responsibility. We condemn over-indulgence of all kinds. And yet, we don't value frugality, the most important virtue of our forefathers. We accept as given that the economy must grow, that we must always increase our consumption and aspire to bigger and more expensive things. As David G. Myers points out in his essay, more doesn't make us happier.<br /><br />This volume covers the theory of voluntary simplicity with essays by Amitai Etzioni, Abraham Maslow, Myers, Luttwak, Juliet Schor, and Robert Frank. It explores the history of voluntary simplicity in essays by David Shi, Charles Wagner, Richard B. Gregg, and Duane Elgin. Anti-simplifiers are represented by a typically smirky essay by David Brooks and a typically confused essay by James Twitchell, who embraces consumerism while simultaneously loathing himself for it.<br /><br />A theme that runs through many of these essays is that everyone should adopt voluntary simplicity. It seems obvious that the world would be better if everyone reduced consumption, recycled, and considered quality of life over quantity of things. But one thing I like about voluntary simplicity is that it is anarchic in a way. There are no real leaders, and you can practice simple living as much or as little as you like and adapt it to your own circumstances: in a city or in the sticks, as a family or individual or as a community.<br /><br />Voluntary Simplicity: Responding to Consumer Culture is a thought-provoking collection, for those familiar with simple living and those who are new to the idea.neously loathing himself for it.  <br /> <br />A theme that runs through many of these essays is that everyone should adopt voluntary simplicity.

The news was serious, but she and her co-anchor, Lloyd Dobyns, seemed to be taking it all with a grain of salt, enjoying their gig while all the grown-up anchors were asleep. It was fun to watch reporters who weren't taking themselves too seriously.<br /><br />For the most part, Ellerbee maintains that attitude in Take Big Bites, but it's a bit difficult when you've been through a few marriages, breast cancer, and reporting from war zones. Take Big Bites isn't exactly a memoir, it's a collection of essays and memories of places she's been, people she's met, food she's eaten. You can take it in order, or skip around, as Ellerbee has done.<br /><br />I suggest small bites, contrary to Ellerbee's advice. A little bit of Ellerbee goes a long way. Her first encounter with pho, Vietnamese noodle soup is amusing, and so is her reaction to Singapore. But there is a bit too much homespun philosophy for my taste, as well as James Taylor lyrics. I like JT as much as anyone who came of age in the Seventies, but quoting him this much seems like an odd 'blast-from-the-past'.	2005-10-11

Journalist Polly Toynbee does justice to the genre. She works mind-numbing jobs that pay just enough to keep her in poverty. She packages pastries and cleans hotel rooms, she lives in a squalid flat she can barely afford, and she tries to make ends meet on minimum wage. It is very depressing.<br /><br />Toynbee finds that being one of the working poor is to be defeated at every turn. When she gets her dark, damp, unfurnished flat, she has to borrow money from the Housing Authority to furnish it because she won't get paid until she has been working for at least two weeks. She can't make an appointment to see the doctor because her job doesn't allow any paid time off. She can't try to get a better job because all the employers want to schedule interviews during her work hours (and she can't afford to take time off) or they want her to devote the day to waiting for an interview. She can't even make her views as a voter known, because to get to the voting station would mean unpaid time off from work, or an hour on the bus and in line waiting to vote after a 10-hour shift on her feet.<br /><br />Life is a constant Catch-22 and she finally admits defeat when she has to move out of her apartment because the building's front door doesn't lock, there are drug dealers in the lobby, and she can't afford a phone.<br /><br />In between descriptions of her alternate life in the slum, she splices discussions of the politics behind the policies regarding wages and poverty in Great Britain. Even for someone who isn't familiar with British government, it is very clear. It is also obvious that we in America have a lot in common with Britain.	2005-10-09

De Blasi takes risks as a writer and as a woman. The story is not quite believable, but somehow she pulls it off.<br /><br />By concentrating on the attractions and food of Venice, and by sticking to the unfolding of an unlikely love affair, de Blasi makes A Thousand Days in Venice an enjoyable story. It isn't very long before you stop thinking about how eccentric de Blasi must be in real life and just lose yourself in the romance of Venice.<br /><br />There was just enough conflict here to keep A Thousand Days from being a soppy travelog. All of de Blasi's friends are convinced that she is making a dreadful mistake by giving up her house and job in Saint Louis (as she insists on spelling it) and moving to Venice to marry a man she had met only months before. Then as she gets to know Fernando better, she finds he has certain ideas about how she should dress, conduct herself, and speak. Will the romance survive the doubts and the clash of cultures?<br /><br />Of course it does, and after the couple exhausts Venice with their exuberance, they move on to Tuscany to start a new life, and a new book.	2005-10-07

Journalist Andrew Eames follows in the footsteps of Agatha Christie as he retraces her route from London to Baghdad on the Orient Express.  Christie traveled to the Middle East many times and enjoyed her visits there. When she visited, before World War II, places such as Damascus and Cairo and even Baghdad evoked romantic and exotic images. Eames's journey takes place in 2003 when even Lawrence of Arabia might think twice about going.<br /><br />Eames sleeps through the European part of the trip, eager to get to the more challenging Belgrade and Serbia and beyond. On the way, he recalls what it would have been like in Christie's time and observes what it is like now. Sometimes, as in the London suburb where he begins the journey, not much has changed. Often, as in Belgrade and certainly Baghdad, things are much different.<br /><br />8:55 to Baghdad hurtles from familiar to exotic to frightening and back again. When things start to get too gritty and real in Serbia, Eames takes us back to the days of luxury aboard the Orient Express. When the company of pre-WWII upper class snobs threatens to become boring, we are whisked onto a bus to cross the border into Iraq on the eve of war in 2003.<br /><br />All along the way, Eames recalls Christie's career and her life. She enjoyed accompanying her archaeologist husband to the Middle East and didn't mind roughing it from time to time. Roughing it back then meant camping out at a dig in the desert without running water. Roughing it in Baghdad in 2003 meant dodging bombs.<br /><br />Even if you are not a Christie fan, there is a lot to enjoy in this narrative. The Orient Express, archaeology, modern history, travel essay, it's all here. It reminds me of Beyond the Blue Horizon by Alexander Frater, another British writer. In it, Frater sets out to travel around the world using only routes that Imperial Airways would have flown. Imperial Airways was the pre-WWII airline of the British Empire, so that meant Frater had to do a lot of puddle-jumping on small propeller-driven airplanes in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Both he and Andrew Eames mix past and present to come up with unique and memorable travel stories.to do a lot of puddle-jumping on small propeller-driven airplanes in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

I loved the unabridged and somewhat edgier version even more. I have enjoyed every one of his essay collections. His delivery, written and spoken, is unique.<br /><br />On the other hand, I am no Sedarista. While some of his pieces are funny or touching or thoughtful or odd, others are a bit creepy. I first read The Girl Next Door in The New Yorker and it was disturbing, not only because of the strange family he describes, but because of his own behavior. It was no less disturbing a second time around.<br /><br />All but one of the essays in this collection have appeared before, in magazines or on radio. The single essay that seems to be newly published here is Chicken in the Henhouse, funny in places, but it left me uneasy in the same way that The Girl Next Door did.<br /><br />These essays have Sedaris's family as their theme. Apparently the family member who is most comfortable in his own skin is his younger brother, Paul, a Southern redneck who surrounds himself with clutter and dogs. Sedaris never mentions that his sister Amy is also a writer. There are funny lines and conversations, but I wouldn't categorize this as a humor collection. His previous collections have included mainstream funny essays with more serious and unsettling pieces. This collection contains nothing like SantaLand Diaries or Me Talk Pretty One Day and Jesus Shaves, two fabulous essays about the trials of learning French, and trying to explain, with limited vocabulary, why an egg-laying bunny is the symbol of Easter in America. The pieces in Dress Your Family are a little too honest and revealing to be comfortably funny.<br /><br />But I read every word. Sedaris's writing is clean and spare. He doesn't waste any words. These essays, as effortless as they read, must have required merciless editing on Sedaris's part to remove every unnecessary word, and to make every phrase just the right one.<br /><br />Which is why I am still puzzling over the title. There is no essay called Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, nor is there any reference to corduroy or denim. Perhaps it has to do with the French origin of the words? Maybe the reason is so obvious that when someone tells me what it means, I'll smack my forehead and feel like a dope.

We also learn quite a lot about the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley.<br /><br />Not only is Vowell obsessed with the deaths of these three presidents, but she is fascinated by the men who killed them and the circumstances surrounding the shootings. So she goes on a pilgrimage to learn all she can about these grim stories. Assassination Vacation is the result.<br /><br />There's a ton of history in the book. We learn that John Wilkes Booth was well-known before he killed Lincoln. As a famous actor, he was able to move freely between North and South during the Civil War, unlike regular people, prompting Vowell to observe \\"There's a lesson for the terrorists of the world: ...they should put less energy into training illiterate ten-year-olds how to fire Kalashnikovs and start recruiting celebrities like George Clooney. I bet nobody's inspected that man's luggage since the second season of ER.\\"<br /><br />According to Vowell, the Lincoln assassination was part of a plot in which accomplices of Booth would simultaneously kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward to bring down the government. The man who was to shoot Johnson chickened out, but Seward was nearly killed and only survived because the would-be assassin's gun jammed. Did I miss that day in history class?<br /><br />This is the kind of fascinating stuff that Vowell slings throughout the book, keeping my attention even though pre-WWI American history has always been a snoozer for me. Here's another - in 1912, when former president Teddy Roosevelt was campaigning for president on the Bull Moose ticket, he was shot. The bullet hit him in the chest, but was first deflected by the steel glasses case and folded-up notes for his campaign speech in his pocket. He was bruised and bleeding, but gave the speech as scheduled.<br /><br />This isn't just a history book, it's Vowell taking us (and the friends and relatives she coerces into driving her - driving phobia, remember?) along and providing entertaining commentary along the way. She also tells us what she thinks of bed and breakfast inns, the movie Starship Trooper, succotash and grits, and the current political climate in America. If you don't want her opinions, better not read the book.scheduled.  <br /> <br />This isn't just a history book, it's Vowell taking us (and the friends and relatives she coerces into driving her - driving phobia, remember?) along and providing entertaining commentary along the way.

There are some people that you can read about again and again: Henry VIII; Mary, Queen of Scots; Elizabeth I; Richard III; Leonardo da Vinci, Marie Curie, Amelia Earhart. Ivan the Terrible is one of these fascinating characters.<br /><br />Author Isabel de Madariaga has written an energetic new biography of Ivan IV. All your favorite Ivan stories are here: how he snapped after the death of his first wife, how he created the group that evolved into the KGB, how he killed his own son. But wait, there's more!<br /><br />De Madariaga raises a question I haven't read anywhere else - that Ivan may have been influenced by the tale of Vlad Tepes Dracul, a Wallachian ruler who inspired the tale of Dracula. She details how Ivan very likely was familiar with the story. In fact, she finds evidence that Ivan would have read (or had heard - we don't actually know if he was literate) a version of Vlad the Impaler that excused his cruelty as being for the sake of his subjects.<br /><br />In any case, Ivan certainly was terrible, although he was called that not for his behavior, but for his position as ruler of all of Russia. \\"Terrible\\" in this case meant \\"awe-inspiring\\" rather than cruel. As it happened though, the name fits no matter how you look at it.	2005-09-29

After all, as the author you do have a certain amount of control over the character, if not over your actual self.<br /><br />The idea behind Douglas Fetherling's book is irresistible: an adult runs away from home by taking a round-the-world trip on a small freighter. Who hasn't fantasized about leaving home, family, and responsibilities, even if just for a while? And the set-up is full of possibilities: a sullen Russian crew, about a dozen other passengers with various backgrounds, and stops in any number of exotic places. Top it off with some kind of an epiphany for our hero and voila!<br /><br />But Fetherling has taken all these possibilities and apparently refused to improve on what really happened. Because what we end up with is an anti-social hero who despises all his shipmates. He admits that he is having trouble with the idea of becoming a grandfather soon, still in his late forties. He has never really liked being married, he declares (and evidently doesn't care what his wife thinks about him announcing that to the world). The constant vibration of the ship's engine makes him feel perpetually \\"goatish.\\"<br /><br />Fetherling is generous with his research, though, and each port of call gets us a history lesson. It would have been fun to read more about his adventures in port, even if he had to make some of them up.<br /><br />When he finally returns home, he announces to his wife that he has decided to stay with her for now, evidently resigned to becoming a grandfather. But I wonder if his wife was any more impressed than the reader. And I wonder if any of the other passengers or crew has written their own book about the voyage. It still seems like a great idea for a book.	2005-09-28

He goes to France the first time at fifteen, by himself, from his home in England. He knows some school French, but it only gets him in trouble. Still, he returns time after time to France, and he tells stories of characters and adventures he has encountered over these fifty-odd years.<br /><br />As easy-to-take as these short recollections are, there is something missing. There doesn't seem to be any thread to connect the memories, all those years. It seems that a love affair with France leaves no room for a true love affair with anyone else. Sure, de Larrabeiti has plenty of trysts with attractive French girls, but there is no relationship that makes it into the next chapter. And yet, the biographical notes on the book flap indicate that he is married and has three grown daughters. I wish he had included something about them.<br /><br />But overall, French Leave is very enjoyable, and the story de Larrabeiti tells of admiring a medieval French tapestry in Paris in the morning and Concorde-ing to New York the same day to see its twin tapestry in a small museum is worth the price of the book alone. The normally bicycle-riding de Larrabeiti is so thrilled with his rare splurge for art that he makes a point of striking up a conversation with an art teacher also viewing the tapestry so that he can brag about it. Perfectly understandable.	2005-09-26

What is striking about Kane and the Beatles is how mature they seemed (for the most part) in the face of unprecedentedly frantic, and sometimes terrifying, whirlwind tours. Sometimes it is startling to think just how young they were -- at one point Kane mentions that George was worried about his pimples.<br /><br />The fans were often hysterical, and there were thousands of them. They climbed on top of cars the Beatles were to travel in, collapsing the roofs. They threw jelly beans, filet mignons, and cans of fruit salad at the Beatles while they were performing. They stalked them and hid out in their rooms. It must have been frightening. But the Beatles maintained a good humor and seemed to be enjoying themselves, according to Kane.<br /><br />This is a fun book, with the occasional unexpected tidbit to keep things interesting. For instance, John Lennon and Jayne Mansfield were a hot item in Hollywood when the Beatles played there. Kane seems to be genuinely fond of the Beatles, except perhaps for Paul, who is painted as a bit standoffish and calculating in this book.<br /><br />Minor drawbacks to Ticket to Ride are that there is no index, and the CD is almost unnecessary. Kane has included all the transcripts of the \\"interviews\\" (snippets, really), and the CD has so much explanation from Kane, that in 60 minutes of recording, there may be about 10 minutes of actual Beatles, and much of that consists of gems as \\"Hey, Larry, how ya' doin'.\\" And Kane makes rather a big deal of Brian Epstein making a pass at him. He hints at it throughout the book, and when he finally tells the whole story near the end, it consists of an invitation which Kane declines, Epstein is disappointed, but doesn't take it any further.<br /><br />Ticket to Ride is well worth an afternoon, perhaps while listening to your old Help! album.	2005-09-25

The Good Life is the British title of the show that we know in America as Good Neighbors.<br /><br />Fans of the series will love this book. It is a slightly oversized paperback, and the quality is good, with slick pages and dozens of photos throughout. It includes a history of the series, profiles of the main actors, an episode guide, and interviews with those who were there for the different stages of making the show. There are even sidebars with people only marginally connected with the show. For instance, Peter Bowles recalls being asked to play the role of Jerry, but he was in an Alan Ayckbourn play at the time and turned it down.<br /><br />The only thing missing from the book is a complete transcript of each episode, which would be nice for those of us who sometimes miss references to things peculiarly British. So I am making notes in my copy. We've deciphered Duncan Sandys, Blue Peter, The Lilac Domino, Acker Bilk, the Magic Roundabout, Wedgie Benn and now know who or what they are.<br /><br />This would be a terrific gift for anyone who likes Good Neighbors, but order early, because you will probably have to order from the U.K. site.	2005-09-25

Among them are Spellbound, a movie about the National Spelling Bee; Word Wars and Word Freak, a movie and a book about the national Scrabble tournament; and Cookoff, a book about the competitive cooking circuit. Most of these share a fly-on-the-wall approach that focuses on the contestants and leaves the observer well out of the picture.<br /><br />In Crossworld, author Marc Romano takes a different approach. He features himself prominently throughout, as both an observer and a contestant. It's an approach that often works well in memoirs and in essays. In this case though, I was hoping for an inside look at the crossword puzzle tournament and instead I got an inside look at Marc Romano.<br /><br />Romano confesses that he is smart, loves crosswords, has trouble with women, drinks too much, eats too little, and adores both crossword editor Will Shortz and crossword constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley. After covering the tournament one year for the Boston Globe newspaper, he decided to compete the following year and write a book about his experiences.<br /><br />Like a lot of smart people, Romano tends to show off. I thought my vocabulary was pretty good, but I found myself trotting over to the dictionary about a dozen times while reading Crossworld. And it was a good thing I did, because if I had relied on Romano's usages, I would have learned that \\"to cozen up to\\" means \\"to cozy up to,\\" which it doesn't, and that a cuckold can refer to a man or a woman, which it can't.<br /><br />In addition to dodgy definitions, Romano has some peculiar ideas about the nature of crossword puzzles. He imagines that people who do crosswords are nicer than other people, and that men are better suited than women to do crosswords, at least competitively. He thinks that if more people did crosswords, the world would be a more peaceful place, and that \\"there is something inherently moral about doing crossword puzzles.\\" He also wonders \\"if sex weren't in fact somehow involved in all this\\" after hearing one contestant's theory that crosswords are like sex. Preoccupied with this train of thought, he comforts himself with the thought that he is not alone in his alone-ness. After all, \\"I very much doubted that the constructors ... were getting any either - because, let's face it, most are on the far side of fifty.\\" If you are thinking, as I was, that Romano is a youngster in his twenties, you will be surprised to learn that he is, to paraphrase Fran Lebowitz, in his latest possible thirties.<br /><br />In spite of all this, Crossworld is still an interesting perspective on the world of competitive crossword puzzling. There are some revealing interviews with contestants and constructors, and a run-down on what happens before, during, and after the competitions. I look forward to reading other books (by other authors) on this subject.here is something inherently moral about doing crossword puzzles.\\" He also wonders \\"if sex weren't in fact somehow involved in all this\\" after hearing one contestant's theory that crosswords are like sex.

It overlooks the Kremlin and is one of the most desirable residences in the city. Designed to house 3,500 residents, it also has restaurants and shops on the ground floor. The original residents, handpicked by Stalin and his aides, were artists, high-level bureaucrats, and senior military people. Some of them still live there today, some of the apartments are occupied by their descendents, still others were purchased after the apartments were privatized.<br /><br />Nivat sees the building as a microcosm of the New Russia. This is a hard case to make. Moscow is not typical of Russia, any more than New York is typical of America. And the vysotka is not typical of Moscow any more than Trump Tower is typical of New York. Still, there really is an interesting cross-section of residents there, and Nivat lets them do most of the talking in her book.<br /><br />One resident, whose father sculpted many of the giant Lenin statues that used to decorate Moscow, summarized their attitudes. It all breaks down by age, he said. Those over seventy are nostalgic for the past, those in their fifties are disappointed and are having a hard time adjusting to the New Russia, those under forty have adapted one way or another, and the under-twenty-fives have never known anything else. That certainly holds true for those interviewed here. Older residents reminisce about when they or their parents were the toast of the town. They yearn for the good old days of Stalin. One of the lobby attendants is wistful about the changes since the fall of communism. \\"If only we had taken the best parts of the West, instead of choosing the worst!\\"<br /><br />A common thread in these interviews is the affection everyone here has for Moscow. Even the most cynical, even the foreign residents, and especially Anne Nivat herself, love Moscow and Russia.

He tells us of \\"Revolutionary Power,\\" the notion of a government that doesn't accept the current system's legitimacy and doesn't follow the usual rules. Although the concept was first written of in regard to 19th century Europe and the author of the idea was a doctoral candidate in 1957 named Henry Kissinger, the description struck Krugman as remarkably similar to what is happening today in America.<br /><br />It seems that the Revolutionary Power acts so out of line with normal diplomacy and politics that other nations and individuals don't realize how radical the RP is. Even when it is increasingly obvious what is going on, people refuse to believe it. The few critics will be dismissed as shrill or hysterical or as conspiracy theorists.<br /><br />Of course, Krugman thinks the current administration may well be a Revolutionary Power. He describes how they (in his view) are turning diplomacy on its head with notions of pre-emptive war and unilateralism. Domestically, he believes that our RP is running huge deficits in order to make Social Security impossible to fund.<br /><br />The Great Unraveling consists mostly of previously published columns, arranged by topic. This makes the text a bit jumpy, since he skips from the year 2000 to 2003 and back again, depending on the subject.<br /><br />Krugman makes a pretty good case for his claims and he explains even complex topics, such as the Enron scandal, and George W. Bush's Harken shenanigans, clearly and concisely. And he brings a calm, fiscally conservative attitude to some seemingly outrageous ideas. What seems outlandish coming from someone like columnist Ted Rall, for instance, seems perfectly reasonable when the economist Krugman says it.<br /><br />Possibly radical, certainly alarming, and definitely a worthwhile book.	2005-09-15

As the decade began, less than 1 per cent of American households owned TVs, but by the end of the decade, 88 per cent had TVs in their homes. Author Marsha Cassidy explores how women in the post-World War II era were portrayed and how they were targeted as consumers.<br /><br />Evening programming had sorted itself out quickly, with shows that appealed to the whole family: dramas, westerns, quiz shows, sitcoms. But daytime programming, not unlike many women after the war, had a hard time defining its role. Many local stations didn't even broadcast during the day. How could the advertisers ignore a market as large as the housewives of America? Many sponsors thought that they couldn't compete with radio because housewives busy doing their chores couldn't spare the time to sit in front of the TV. That's why many of the first daytime shows were variety shows imported from radio that featured music and chat, but nothing visually compelling. The first TV soaps were only fifteen minutes long, for fear that women wouldn't sit in front of the set any longer than that. Locally produced shows usually featured homemaking topics such as cooking, parenting, and sewing.<br /><br />As the decade progressed, the networks hit their stride and came up with successful daytime shows. Variety shows such as Art Linkletter's House Party, The Garry Moore Show, and Arthur Godfrey Time sold plenty of appliances and soap. Dubbed \\"The Charm Boys,\\" the dimply hosts of these shows appealed to women in much the same way David Cassidy and The Backstreet Boys would later appeal to their daughters and granddaughters.<br /><br />There were also women hosts, most notably Arlene Francis and Kate Smith, but in spite of their enormous popularity on radio, their TV shows didn't last long. Cassidy devotes a chapter to each woman.<br /><br />One type of show that is especially fascinating was the misery show, such as Queen for a Day, in which women with tales of personal misfortune competed for prizes. Contestants told genuinely sad stories of being abandoned and pregnant, or of their children who needed operations the family couldn't afford. Whoever best captured the audience's sympathy that day would win prizes provided by the sponsors. It was exploitative in a way that even Jerry Springer doesn't match. And Queen for a Day wasn't the only misery show. Strike It Rich awkwardly combined sob stories with trivia questions. Glamour Girl awarded a makeover to the most miserable contestant.<br /><br />A striking exception to the race to appeal to the lowest common denominator was Matinee Theater, a daily afternoon teleplay. Many of the plays were original productions, others were adapted from Shakespeare or modern playwrights. By all accounts, it was a classy show, but it simply could not compete with the increasingly popular soaps. Strangely enough, soap operas were slow to get going on television, because they were still so popular on radio, and the network executives didn't want to risk transferring them to TV, where they might not work as well. In fact, soaps didn't work well at first on TV, because the producers forgot that it was TV and they just had people sitting around talking. There was no action, and on TV there has to be something to keep your attention on the screen.<br /><br />As important as it is to remain visual, that is still only the second rule of TV. The first rule is that it has to make money. From the very beginning, the networks were focused on one thing, and if they pulled Matinee Theater off the air or extended the contract of schmaltz like Queen For A Day, it was because of the ratings. It helps to remember that there were no agendas, either noble or nefarious, other than selling soap.such as Queen for a Day, in which women with tales of personal misfortune competed for prizes.

In Without Reservations, Steinbach tells the story of how she took a year off from her job, bought an apartment in Paris and fell in love. It is a story of risk and reward. It really happened, but Steinbach tells it like a story.<br /><br />In Educating Alice, Steinbach has quit her newspaper job for good. The royalties from Without Reservations must be rolling in, because now she can afford to take classes at the Ritz cooking school in Paris, geisha school in Kyoto, and a tour of lovely gardens in Avignon. Not much risk here. There is nothing connecting the classes, other than that Steinbach is interested in the subjects.<br /><br />The only thread that runs through the entire book besides Steinbach herself, is Naohiro, her lover from Without Reservations. But the relationship is established and both Alice and Naohiro seem content to leave it as it is. So there is no conflict or drama. If I hadn't known Naohiro from the previous book, I'm not sure I would have been interested in their romance, which is conducted in Educating Alice mostly through letters.<br /><br />I did enjoy reading about Steinbach's adventures at the Ritz in Paris, the first and best chapter of Educating Alice. Her view of the Upstairs, Downstairs nature of the grand hotel and her descriptions of her classmates and the chef are entertaining. Her discovery of the Oltrarno section of Florence is pleasant, and the adventures she has in Havana are the liveliest of the bunch.<br /><br />Steinbach says of the Prague creative writing workshop she attends in one chapter, that \\"I thought the use of fiction techniques might improve my work as a nonfiction writer.\\" While the individual chapters of Educating Alice are told as short stories, it would have been rewarding if the chapters had been parts of a larger story, as well. She didn't need the writing workshop at all. She showed in Without Reservations that she has already mastered that technique.well. She didn't need the writing workshop at all.

Not Another Ruin: Wickedly Funny Travel Tales of an American Adventuress	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Great Title for a Travel Book	Mimi Bartel first traveled to Europe in 1963 at age 58. She loved it. She stayed as long as she could, and when she found herself back in the States, returned to Europe as soon as possible. Unfortunately, poor health forced her to come back home and give up her travels at age 70.<br /><br />For those twelve years, Bartel traveled hard and wrote long letters about her travels. This book is a collection of many of those letters. Armed with Frommer's Europe on $5 a Day, she hit Great Britain, Italy, and France for extended stays, and Greece, Belgium, Holland, and other areas for shorter visits. She had an education in art and history and spoke five languages. And she could write.<br /><br />Oh, No! Not Another Ruin has a few things going for it. The title, for one. Based on that alone, I bought this book. Bartel is interested in everything around her and her enthusiasm comes through in her letters. She writes clearly and frankly about what she sees and experiences, and isn't afraid to share her opinions. She goes everywhere and talks to everyone.<br /><br />On the other hand, apparently what passes for \\"wickedly funny\\" consists of observations about the smelly French, the loud Italians, and the lack of modern conveniences in Britain. She had a bad impression of Amsterdam because of the hippies (this was in 1971). She goes on at great length about the history and the art of the places she visited.<br /><br />I recently reread the journal I wrote during my first trip to Europe in the 1970s. While it reminded me of many of the good times and new experiences I'd had, I was amazed at how much of it was complaints and how much of my writing was boring. I can't imagine anyone else reading it all the way through. Mimi Bartel's book struck me in much the same way. When you are traveling, especially on a budget, much of the time you are tired, hungry, thirsty, sweaty, or have to find a toilet. Enormously interesting when you are confronted with these challenges, they are of little interest to others, or even to oneself after the fact.<br /><br />If Mimi Bartel had edited her own letters for publication, she probably would have left out some of the less interesting parts. But her family published them after she died and was not as ruthless as she might have been.e of little interest to others, or even to oneself after the fact. <br /> <br />If Mimi Bartel had edited her own letters for publication, she probably would have left out some of the less interesting parts.

There are exercises and templates, as well.<br /><br />The book is a little out of date when it comes to markets, since it was published in 1995 and is now out of print with no prospect (at the moment) of a new edition. And the technology has left them behind, too, with nearly every professional constructor using software such as Crossword Compiler. But the rules of the crossword game haven't changed, or the strategies to use when your software has done all it can and you have to come up with that last corner.<br /><br />The Random House Puzzlemaker's Handbook also includes chapters on constructing diagramless puzzles and cryptic crosswords, as well as excellent instructions on making acrostic puzzles.<br /><br />If you can't see paying the going price for this out-of-print and hard-to-find book, maybe you can find it at the library, or even through inter-library loan. It's well worth the wait.	2005-09-08

Some of the people interviewed in the book claimed to have been incorrectly quoted, and some psychologists take issue with Slater's scholarship and conclusions. Having been warned not to take the facts too seriously, I thought it would still be intriguing to consider the deeper questions posed by the scientists who performed the experiments described in the book.<br /><br />Slater debunks the myth that B.F. Skinner raised his first child in a \\"box\\" in order to conduct an elaborate behavior experiment on her. The box turns out to have been a high-tech playpen designed and built by the doting father that Skinner apparently was. Another famous experiment which revealed that most people would torture another if encouraged by a benign authority figure was especially chilling in light of the Abu Ghraib torture by American guards.<br /><br />However, I came away with the distinct impression that Slater is a nut. Slater seemed especially enthusiastic about recreating an experiment in which normal people pretended to be demented enough to enter a mental hospital, then reverted to normal behavior and waited to see how long it would be before they would be discharged. Slater checked into some eight different hospitals. She also took some of the anti-psychotic meds she was prescribed rather than tossing them.<br /><br />She reveals that she was unable to recreate the experiment strictly, because under the original conditions, the pseudo-patients would be truthful after being admitted, but Slater actually had a mental hospital stay in her past, so she lied. And when I read that she took a bite of the ten-year-old chocolate bar in the Skinner House, I simply didn't believe her. But as I read more of the book and learned more about Slater, it wasn't so unbelievable any more.<br /><br />Opening Skinner's Box is definitely an unusual book. It poses many thoughtful questions about the nature of humanness. It is well written, but I can't vouch for how well researched it is or how factual.

It is intended to be humorous, and often is, but in an understated and mostly inoffensive way. It is apparently intended for a Canadian audience, so it stands to reason that I, a non-Canadian, would not appreciate it as a Canadian would.<br /><br />Canada, I'm embarrassed to say, brings to my mind Rick Moranis in a parka and wool hat, Bullwinkle J. Moose (who, technically speaking, isn't Canadian), and Dudley Do-Right. I have visited Canada, so I know it's also great bookstores, low crime rates, and polite people. The politeness threw me off at first. Entering an indoor mall in Toronto, I thanked someone for holding the door for me and he said \\"You're welcome.\\" For several minutes I wondered what he meant by that crack. After a few days, I got used to the politeness all around, and eventually came to like it.<br /><br />So, is there anything uniquely Canadian about sex in Canada? It seems there is. Author Chris Gudgeon goes on at length about Canadian pornography, Canadian swingers' clubs, Canadian nude beaches, and Canadian hookers. There is a fair amount of actual history here, but also plenty or wry remarks, asides, and footnotes. In fact, it is sometimes difficult to tell what is fact and what is Gudgeon's dry wit. There is a bit too much history and fact to make this strictly a light, humorous read, and too much snickering to make this a serious history.<br /><br />I ran into this problem when I read another book by Chris Gudgeon, Luck of the Draw. I wanted some historical information about lotteries and came across his book. Not familiar with Gudgeon's reputation as a wise guy, I started reading Luck of the Draw for information, but found the facts questionable and the tone too flippant. I expect Gudgeon is accurate when it comes to all things Canadian, but I found him unreliable on matters outside Canada. He tells of a lottery mishap south of the Canadian border in the state of New England, for instance.<br /><br />Possibly the most memorable thing about The Naked Truth is the book cover, which shows a naked man's torso, covered by a strategically placed maple leaf.

He examines her influences, her relationships (romantic and otherwise), and her many quirks.<br /><br />Highsmith was never very popular in the U.S., at least until the movie The Talented Mister Ripley, came out after her death. She was more successful in Europe, where fans even recognized her in the street. Perhaps this explains why she lived most of her adult life in Europe. She was never very comfortable anywhere, even in her own body, according to those who knew her, but she seemed less uncomfortable in Europe.<br /><br />What sort of a mind comes up with the sort of strange, compelling stories that Highsmith wrote, with their amoral, yet sympathetic characters? Wilson goes a long way toward answering that question in this biography, but some questions remain unanswered, and maybe it's better that way.	2005-09-05

He says that all but one are available on home video, but he must mean in the U.K., because a quick search shows that only about half are easily available in the U.S. Some of these shows never aired in the U.S., so the American reader may not be as interested in some parts of this book.<br /><br />The subtitle is British Adventure Series of the 1960s and that is an accurate description of the purpose of this book. Chapman examines how the British TV series differed from the American shows of the same time and how these shows in particular typified the decade.<br /><br />Even in the 60s, American television was a dominant cultural force, but British series such as The Avengers and The Champions were still able to capture a large American audience. For one thing, there were few spy series in the U.S., with westerns and detective drama more common. When Brit spy shows came to America, we were ready for them. (Come to think of it, I can't even think of any American spy heroes, fictional or not.)<br /><br />Chapman also looks at how the shows belonged to the Sixties and couldn't succeed beyond the end of the decade. He points out the failure of The New Avengers and The Return of the Saint. On the other hand, it seemes that viewers in the Seventies were receptive to a completely different type of series, as The Prisoner showed.<br /><br />Chapman's writing is clear and engaging, except in the introduction, when he gets bogged down in academic jargon. Don't let that keep you from moving right on to the rest of this thoughtful and entertaining look at some of the best television there has ever been.	2005-09-04

It isn't about how tourists affect the places they visit or about how to market your products to tourists. It explores how travel affects the tourists themselves.<br /><br />Why do people who have comfortable homes travel to places where the food is unfamiliar, the language is difficult, and the locals think they are odd? For many reasons, of course, including curiosity, status, and restlessness. Professor Harrison interviews several dozen Canadian travelers to find out why they go, where they go, what they do when they get there, what they bring back, and what they get out of the experience. She also discuses the difference between traveler and tourist, and sensibly decides there's no significant difference.<br /><br />Being a Tourist is an academic work, but it is readable and interesting for a general reader, too, especially if you are a traveler.

But if anyone could possibly pull it off, Yancey is the one. With a degree in English and a background in theater, he knows how to write well and can spin a story. Sometimes he gets carried away with literary pretensions, but only rarely. For the most part, he tells a tight and tense story.<br /><br />Yancey was a collections agent. He hunted down delinquent taxpayers and made them pay. If they refused or couldn't pay, he attached their bank accounts, repossessed their cars, and seized their homes and businesses. You can perform all sorts of mental contortions to deal with a job like that, but it will get to you one way or another. No one leaves unscathed.<br /><br />I would not have believed Yancey's characterizations of his colleagues and bosses if I had not been in federal service myself for fifteen years (not with the IRS). The psychotic mind games, the petty one-upsmanship, the general attitude that your agency and profession is the hub of the universe; sadly, it all rings true. Even the cartoon-like uber-agent William Culpepper must have been real.<br /><br />Yancey telegraphs a fair amount of the story. You know as soon as he mentions her \\"mousey-brown hair\\" that his fiancee will not be with him by the end of the story. You know with his first description of the woman he eventually ends up with with that she will be the one. I was not able to predict whether he would stay with the agency after the first year or if he would get out before he sustained permanent damage, only because I was hoping against hope that he would take the advice of every interviewer, every supervisor, every colleague, to get out, get out, get out!	2005-08-31

His father devoted his whole life to molding Ichiro into a model baseball player. Ichiro, though an excellent student, passed up college for baseball. He had a good career in Japan, then went on to a tremendous start in American baseball as a member of the Seattle Mariners. The story of a father and son so devoted to baseball and so successful is a compelling one.<br /><br />So what is the Samurai Way of Baseball? As Whiting settles into a broader look at Japanese baseball and its relationship with American baseball, it emerges that while the two baseballs have much in common, a big difference is in the cultural attitudes of Japan and America. In Japan, the individual works for the good of the larger group -- the family, the school, the company, the country, the baseball team. In America, the individual is self-reliant and takes himself as far as he can go, breaking records and setting new standards. Of course, both of these attributes make baseball what it is.<br /><br />Whiting goes into the history of baseball in Japan and the participation of Americans in Japanese baseball. American players, managers, even a few umpires, have had limited success in Japan, mostly because of cultural differences, but also because of racism in Japan. Whiting's explanation of the meaning of the word \\"gaijin\\" and how it is used is very revealing.<br /><br />The relatively recent entrance of Japanese players to America has been more successful. Whiting looks at the Japanese and American careers of several Japanese players. So far, there are no coaches or managers who have made the transition from Japan to America.<br /><br />(The title of the book was changed with the release of the paperback edition, from The Meaning of Ichiro to The Samurai Way of Baseball. This was probably an attempt to attract buyers of business/management books in addition to readers of sports/popular culture books.

She discusses Amazon.com and eBay, even examining the merits of allowing customers to review the products for sale.

It explains things in terms even I, a slow learner when it comes to science, can understand. Things such as the fact that a heart transplant is completely different from a liver transplant (I guess I had thought that once they'd figured out how to pop one organ into someone, the procedure would be pretty much the same for the other organs). Transplant also goes into more detail for those who are medically inclined. Still, there really wasn't very much that an interested and moderately intelligent reader couldn't understand.<br /><br />Tilney covers many aspects of transplantation, such as the mythology of grafting parts of one being onto another, the pre-twentieth century history of transplants (rather gruesome), the trial-and-error progress through most of the twentieth century, the ethics of using organs from the brain-dead or from other species, and the cultural differences that make donating organs almost impossible in some countries (in Japan, for instance, a person isn't considered dead until their heart stops beating, so there is no such thing there as being brain-dead). An interesting sidelight was the effect of war on the progress of transplantation studies. World War II provided thousands of burn victims, so that by the end of the war, surgeons had developed the procedures for skin grafts and were quite proficient at it. But the same war caused delays in the progress of kidney transplant science when the Nazis disrupted the work of Dutch doctors.<br /><br />Transplant has numerous photos to illustrate the readable and engaging text. And every so often Tilney tosses in an amusing story to liven things up. Like the story of a group of transplanted monkeys in Canada who got hooked on soap operas, which made it easy for the researchers to determine when they weren't feeling well. When the monkeys weren't interested in their soaps, something was wrong!<br /><br />Transplant not only filled in some big gaps in my education, but it really made me appreciate what huge advances medicine made in the last fifty years.

Exotic Appetites is the brainiac version. Although this seems to be intended as an academic work, it is sprinkled with personal anecdotes and references from popular culture. This makes it readable for anyone interested in food.<br /><br />Heldke considers food from every angle. What is exotic food? Is food that is exotic to one person or culture exotic to another? When does it stop being exotic? (Pizza used to be considered exotic in America.) How do we change food when we take it out of its \\"native habitat\\"? Do we somehow endanger it?<br /><br />With references to Calvin Trillin, Wayne's World, Sara Paretsky, Pierre Bourdieu, Tony Hillerman, and Jane & Michael Stern, among others, this is a wide-ranging look at food adventuring.

It was clear, fun to read, and full of good advice. I was recently surprised to see it is still in print, revised and updated.<br /><br />If you're already the sort of person who reads personal finance books, it won't be the only one you'll read, but it may be the one that holds up the best over time. Tips such as \\"invest\\" in staples such as coffee when they are cheap and ride out times of inflated prices by using your surplus are as useful today as they were in 1978. (Although if I remember, Tobias used canned tuna as the example in the earlier editions, and now uses cases of wine to illustrate the point.)<br /><br />Tobias has updated the book to include investment advice that we never considered in 1978. He includes tips on how to find the best online air fares, when and when not to use eBay, TiVo, and reverse mortgages. He has some simple and effective ideas on how to make Social Security viable for the foreseeable future (without resorting to privitization). He gives specific advice to couples who are married and couples who aren't or who can't be.<br /><br />One of my favorite sections is on what to do if you win the lottery. How many long drives have I passed by planning that very thing? (My first step: get an unlisted phone number.) Tobias's advice on this unlikely event is excellent, especially step 5b.) Don't buy a boat.	2005-08-19

Camp All-American, Hanoi Jane, and the High-and-Tight starts out by quoting the woman-hating and profane marching songs of some basic training units. She describes the perverted and disgusting hazing that first-year service academy students are subjected to. She explains how a Navy admiral who didn't fit the mold was ridiculed, criticized, and threatened until he finally committed suicide. This is not the military that the Pentagon wants us to see.<br /><br />Burke's observations and conclusions, however, are not to be dismissed. The military is a macho culture and in an all-volunteer force, those who join are either compelled to by economics (lack of training and opportunity for better jobs) or are attracted by what seems to be the last bastion of the ultra masculine he-man, no-girls-allowed crowd. Burke investigates why this should be and how it is neither good for the military mission nor sustainable.<br /><br />Burke's style is readable and entertaining. She takes the lid off the military's embarrassing secrets and proceeds to shock and awe. Much more disturbing than the overt misogyny of the marching songs Burke cites, are the numerous lyrics that mention napalming and killing children. This sounds like a disfunctional organization rather than a training ground for tomorrow's heroes.<br /><br />Camp All-American is well-researched and there is an excellent bibliography. A single exception may have been the story she tells of the bedtime ritual at the Naval Academy, in which plebes say goodnight to their superiors and then to Jane Fonda, followed by a profanity. The only source for this story is an anonymous academy faculty member.<br /><br />As I was reading the book, which was published in early 2004, I wondered how Burke would explain Abu Ghraib in the context of her military and prison studies. As luck would have it, the online magazine Salon did an interview with her and it's still available in their archives. In it she addresses that very subject. The Lord of the Flies mentality did not surprise Burke, nor did the fact that everything was meticulously photographed. She mentioned, as she does in the book, that as society changes and technology advances, the military will find that gender is no longer an issue.

Who participates? Why do people join the movement? How do they participate? What has the movement accomplished? Where is it going? Mary Grigsby asks these questions and seeks to answer them in this sociological study.<br /><br />It's difficult to get a handle on the voluntary simplicity movement because, by its nature as a counterculture, there are no leaders and there is no generally acknowledged definition of the movement, if indeed there is really a movement at all. It is a sort of anarchic trend of downshifting, financial independence, and back-to-the-land. Politically, it embraces bits of socialism, libertarianism, and anti-globalization. Individuals pick and choose the parts of voluntary simplicity that suit them. Some participate in simplicity circles, many don't. Since Grigsby was only able to interview and observe those who participated in simplicity circles, she saw only a sliver of the movement.<br /><br />What she did see, however, makes for some surprising reading. She mentions several times that she is sympathetic to the ideas of voluntary simplicity, and she participated in at least one circle. She found that as a group, simple-livers are overwhelmingly white, middle-class, and heterosexual. They are mostly middle-aged and have no children, or at least, no children living at home. In other words, this group of anti-establishment pioneers is actually a closed society much like the very people who run things.<br /><br />Grigsby finds the simple-livers fall into the stereotypes you would expect to find in any other middle-aged, middle-class, white group of North Americans. In simplicity circles, the men tend to take over. Everyone makes excuses for themselves when they don't live up to the expectations they think you have (\\"I see Costco as a heartless, spiritless, communityless operation, but some things are half-price there.\\")<br /><br />The book's conclusion is a comprehensive list of steps the voluntary simplicity movement can take to achieve its goals, for instance, expand the group beyond its heterogeneous boundaries in order to get new input and different ideas on how to make voluntary simplicity work. Grigsby's list is practical and realistic.<br /><br />Grigsby mentions that this book came out of her work on a dissertation, so there's a fair amount of sociological jargon. Still, it is a readable book on a compelling subject, and her findings should jar some of the more self-satisfied simple-livers. It is original and at times, unexpected. (A comparison of voluntary simplicity with Wicca threw me for a loop until I saw that Grigsby's dissertation advisor has written articles on witchcraft. Aha.)ntary simplicity movement can take to achieve its goals, for instance, expand the group beyond its heterogeneous boundaries in order to get new input and different ideas on how to make voluntary simplicity work.

I picked up Spree; A Cultural History of Shopping thinking it would be a quick and enjoyable read. Enjoyable, yes. Quick, no.<br /><br />For such a small book (trade paperback, 230 pages including an excellent bibliography and index), Spree is packed with more information about shopping than you would have imagined.<br /><br />Canadian author Pamela Klaffke examines shopping from a multitude of angles, taking only a few pages at most for each topic. She really knows how to distill information down to the basics, while remaining informative and entertaining. Learn about Muzak, malls, Tupperware, infomercials, pawn shops, mystery shoppers, dysfunctional shopping, mall walking, and more. My favorite chapter is Shopping and the Media, which examines how shopping is portrayed in movies, television (sitcoms and game shows), and music.<br /><br />The text is interesting enough, but in the wide side margins of many pages are additional tidbits, such as a list of celebrity shoplifters, a list of celebrity cheapskates (Katie Couric!), and the evolution of Buy Nothing Day.<br /><br />Great to browse through or to read from cover to cover.	2005-08-16

I like to read about money and about baseball, but I don't really care about the economics of baseball. Then I found out that Moneyball is about the Oakland A's, computers, and statistics. I had to read it.<br /><br />Lewis reveals how the A's became a top team even though they have one of the smallest payrolls in baseball. Billy Beane's (the general manager) method of using massive amounts of statistical information tells him what players to draft and what plays to execute under different conditions. The scouts and even the manager have become less important than his small staff of number-crunchers.<br /><br />By following certain statistically-determined rules such as \\"never sacrifice bunt,\\" (the numbers show that historically, it doesn't pay off) the A's have gone to the playoffs year after year. Beane refuses to draft players out of high school, because they haven't faced enough real competition to determine, statistically, if they will be any good. It's only in college and the minor leagues that players compile meaningful stats.<br /><br />There isn't much money in Moneyball, but there is a lot of baseball and a terrific story about an underdog team that beats the odds by using the odds.	2005-08-15

Lewis profiles Jonathan Lebed, a teenage stock market wizard (the SEC says he was a stock market manipulator -- Lewis isn't so sure); a teenage law expert who has never studied law; a teenager in England who is using Gnutella software as a springboard to, I don't know, take over the world, I guess.<br /><br />It seems obvious from the first half of the book that teenage boys are using the internet to become rich, powerful, and influential. So maybe all the internet has really done is speed things up by a few decades. But Lewis throws the over-thirties among us a small bone by interviewing an aging rock group that uses the internet to raise money for a tour, an eighty-something woman who participates in WebTV polls, and the creators of TiVo.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a bit unconvincing. Set-top boxes, big deal. Those teenagers rule the book, and it would seem, the world.<br /><br />Lewis, as usual, writes an engaging book, it pulls you right in and moves quickly. The Lebed story itself makes the book worth your time.	2005-08-13

But I figured that anyone who is as consistently successful as King is might have something worthwhile to say about writing. He does.<br /><br />On Writing really flows. I sat down and read the whole thing. I was interested in how King started out (in pulp magazines mainly, not a viable option these days) and in how he goes about writing a book. This was the eye-opening part for me. King says he comes up with an idea and writes a first draft. Apparently he doesn't spend a lot of time plotting and outlining and developing characters. Well, he does, but not separately from writing the draft. In other words, he gets right down to the fun part.<br /><br />On Writing made me want to get right down to work writing. Here is a writer that really seems to enjoy writing. So many writers seem to like having written, but not the act of writing itself. So even if horror is not your favorite genre, you can learn a lot from King about writing, and about enjoying writing.	2005-08-12

He turned his hobby of traveling in Europe into a successful career writing travel guides, went on to make fantastically popular travel TV shows and videos, and runs a rapidly growing tour company. Yes, he works very hard, but he also gets to spend four months doing research in Europe every year in addition to whatever vacation he takes.<br /><br />Rick Steves has my dream job. When I took my first trip to Europe as a teenager, I met lots of kids in youth hostels who spent half the year working long hours for low pay so they could spend the other half of the year traveling. That seemed like the perfect life to me then, but now I think Steves has done much better than that (except for the part about being away from his family for a third of every year).<br /><br />Naturally, I wanted to know how he did it. In Postcards From Europe, he explains. If you have read his newsletters, you've probably already read a good portion of the book since Steves recycles his writing often. If you have seen his travel shows and videos you will be familiar with quite a few of these episodes as well. But in the book, Steves has let down his guard a bit and is more opinionated, a little less bubbly. The prose is still well-carbonated, as he might put it, with lots of travel guide phrasing and over-the-top descriptions.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are quite a few scenes that would never make it to public TV or even into his guidebooks. Nothing scandalous, he only hints at romance on the road, all in the distant past. He tells of  some of the shortcuts he took on his first few trips as a tour guide, such as not making hotel reservations and sending the group out to find rooms for the night, and on occasion, having them all camp out. He even admits a few mistakes he's made, such as putting tour groups up in substandard accommodations in order to make them appreciate being rich Americans. Of course, these were people who signed up for the cheapest tour they could find, and probably already knew that they were incredibly fortunate to be able to travel at all.<br /><br />Steves's transformation from a travel guide writer and lecturer whose goal was to help people travel on their own, into a tour mogul whose company takes some 3,000 people on guided tours every year (and they aren't cheap anymore), makes an  interesting story. Apparently, people practically begged him to lead tours rather than go on their own. Many people simply didn't want to be bothered finding a room and dealing with transportation every day.  They wanted to spend their precious time in Europe enjoying the sights and the people. Steves harbors a thinly-veiled contempt for these tourists, even as they pay him scads of money. I can't blame him for taking the money, though. If I were in his shoes, I'm sure I'd do the same. But as someone who traveled on my own or with my husband the first dozen trips, I was surprised at how nice it was to take a tour and let someone else deal with the logistics. I think Steves understands that, but still has no respect for it.<br /><br />For someone who has spent months out of every year traveling in Europe, Steves seems to hit the same places over and over. In Postcards From Europe, he goes on a circuit of Europe that mimics his most popular guided tour and highlights many of the same cities he emphasizes in his guidebooks and on his TV shows. Of course Paris and Venice are worth seeing over and over. But Rothenburg and Gimmelwald (a tiny town in the Swiss Alps), charming as they are, don't seem to be worth quite this much press. There must be other small and picturesque town that Steves can discover, even after all these years. What I would find really interesting is to follow Steves as he visits a town he's never been to before and see how he approaches it. His motto is that he makes the travel mistakes so we don't have to. How does a seasoned traveler make a new town one of his favorites or decide it just isn't worth his time?<br /><br />Postcards From Europe is a readable narrative of how one man was able to make a living doing what he loves, and is also something of an unintentional tale of how money can influence even the most idealistic and focused of people.e a new town one of his favorites or decide it just isn't worth his time?  <br /> <br />Postcards From Europe is a readable narrative of how one man was able to make a living doing what he loves, and is also something of an unintentional tale of how money can influence even the most idealistic and focused of people.	2005-08-11

I was less interested in his emotional problems and his social difficulties. I remember the horror of realizing that he was going to lose his mental abilities and that he would be aware of what was happening to him, yet helpless to prevent it.<br /><br />I found myself recalling the story when I recently helped a relative move into a nursing home. She has an Alzheimer's-like condition that makes it unsafe for her to live on her own or even to go out by herself. She used to be mentally sharp, loved to travel, and took a brisk walk every day. She understands what is happening to her brain and knows there is nothing that she can do about it. She has gone from forgetting little-used words like \\"ginger-ale\\" to forgetting everyday words like \\"calendar\\" and \\"TV\\" and even the name of the street she lived on for the last forty years. She is remarkably philosophical about what is happening to her, explaining to her friends that that's just the way it is.<br /><br />But it must be terribly frustrating to have your own brain let you down after all these years, and to know that it will keep getting worse, and that no one can do anything to stop it. When I found a copy of Flowers for Algernon, I was hesitant to read it again, afraid it would be too close to home this time. It's a fast-moving story that gets going right away. Soon I was caught up in the changes Charlie is going through and dreading the inevitable ending.<br /><br />To my surprise, the ending did not leave me feeling helpless and depressed. Although it was a shame that Charlie couldn't remain a genius, he seemed more at peace with his life in the end, and even more mature as a human being. In the story, as in real life, if you have a choice (and most of us do), you should choose to be smarter. If, on the other hand, you really no longer have a choice, there's something to be said for accepting that. (For what it's worth, if it ever comes to it, I will fight it tooth and nail.), if you have a choice (and most of us do), you should choose to be smarter.

I mean, what sends one person into hysterics leaves another person cold, and yet another mildly amused. A few years ago every writer who made one reviewer laugh was called the new Dave Barry or Bill Bryson. Now the gold standard is David Sedaris, which is odd, because about half of what Sedaris writes is serious and more than a little disturbing. But the other half is extremely funny.<br /><br />Those comparisons aren't very helpful because they are so overused. It might be more helpful if you know what other writers the person that's recommending Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress thinks are funny. I like Laurie Notaro (We Thought You Would Be Prettier), Cheryl Peck (Fat Girls and Lawn Chairs), and yes, David Sedaris (Me Talk Pretty One Day). These are laugh-out-loud funny, like Dave Barry and Bill Bryson used to be. There are plenty of writers who are funny, but not so funny I have to stop and read them out loud to my husband (who is trying to read serious books if only I would stop interrupting him). Dan Zevin (The Day I Stopped Being Cool), Cynthia Kaplan (Why I'm Like This), David Rakoff (Fraud), all amusing, but not worth interrupting anyone for.<br /><br />Sarah Jane Gilman is a little different. While I never actually laughed out loud while reading the stories, I do find myself retelling her stories to people. The pouffy white dress story is unexpected and her story of agonizing over how to come out (as a heterosexual) to her new editor was brilliant. Even her stories as a kindergartner with a penchant for lying were funny.<br /><br />I don't know if Sarah Jane Gilman will be the new standard for humor but I do know that I will read her next book the second it comes out.	2005-08-08

It isn't an academic book, but with its attention to history and detail, its wide range of subtopics having to do with shopping, and the excellent bibliography for further reading, it can serve as a reference work as well as an entertaining pop culture book.<br /><br />Laura Byrne Paquet, a Canadian writer of romance fiction and Ottawa guide books, gives no hint of the distinctive (and different) styles that normally accompany both romance novels and travel writing. The tone here is conversational, even casual, while being very informative.<br /><br />The Urge to Splurge covers Tupperware parties, Avon ladies, mail order shopping, TV infomercials, online shopping, compulsive shopping disorder, kleptomania, shoplifting, the differences between men and women shoppers, malls, markets, bargaining, eBay, department stores, and more. You'll learn about the transition from bargaining to fixed prices. Paquet tells us about the first escalator in Britain, which was in Harrod's and had no steps. \\"It was just a conveyor belt, so thrill-seeking passengers who dared to get on had to hang onto handrails for dear life.\\" Yikes.<br /><br />I was reminded that it was only a few decades ago that Sunday shopping was even possible in most places in North America and Britain. Long after Sunday shopping was the norm in the States, my husband and I spent a month in London and were disappointed to find that nothing was open on Sundays. After the first few restless Sundays, we started planning ahead, finding the few museums and shops that were open on Sunday afternoons, and eventually found ourselves looking forward to Sundays as the day when we could walk the streets and parks of London without the noise of the weekday traffic. Now Sunday is much the same as any other day of the week, shopping-wise.<br /><br />The Urge to Splurge will make you think about your own shopping memories or maybe re-think your attitudes about shopping. The section on Tupperware reminded me that a good friend once invited me to a Tupperware party and that I had turned her down, for the very good reason that I simply could not become the sort of person who goes to Tupperware parties. It seemed I had no problem with being the sort of person who is a snob.<br /><br />There's plenty of historical and social history in The Urge to Splurge, as well as a fair amount of interesting trivia. Perhaps you already knew that eBay did not really begin as a Pez dispenser trading site, or how many hundreds of thousands of dollars Jackie Kennedy Onassis spent on clothes each year.

So she buys a wind-up radio that requires no batteries or electricity and sets off for some places she'd heard were interesting, radio-wise. Travels With My Radio is the result, a hodge-podge of radio adventures in Europe, America, Lebanon, and the Caribbean.<br /><br />The original title was I Am An Oil Tanker, based on a radio blooper made by a dj reading a breaking news bulletin. I'm glad the title was changed to something more straightforward because I would have ignored the book otherwise, thinking it was a children's book. As it was, I saw the title in a catalog (since Amazon doesn't sell the book, only the audiotape, I don't have any qualms about saying that I found it in The Common Reader catalog) and thought, what a great idea for a book. I always travel with a tiny transistor radio and enjoy hearing the different programs around the world.<br /><br />Since Glover is in the business, she gains access to stations and radio hosts wherever she goes and this behind-the-scenes look is quite revealing. She sets off determined to meet Howard Stern and Art Bell, as well as some less famous, less quirky radio personalities. At least half the book is set in the U.S., in California, Las Vegas, New York, and Chicago.<br /><br />Part of the fun of Travels With My Radio, for me, is the Britishness of it. (The book is not published in the U.S.) It's always fun to see what someone from abroad thinks of your country (Ciao, America by Beppe Severgnini, for example). Glover translates everything American into something her intended readers, Brits, will understand. So we end up with a New York traffic reporter saying \\"there's one flipped over on the carriageway in Queens,\\" and a Santa Rosa dj saying \\"another beautiful summer day in Sonoma County with lows of 25 (celsius) on the coast.\\" She misspells unfamiliar placenames: Pahrump, Nevada is consistently spelled Parumph and San Bernardino as San Bernadino. And she decides to take the Greyhound bus to Palm Springs from L.A. Naturally she finds her fellow riders are an odd, scraggly lot, because in this country, no one rides the bus unless they are unable, physically or legally, to drive a car. When she tries to take the city bus within Palm Springs, the bus driver advises her to take a cab.<br /><br />Even though it is now possible to listen to just about any radio station in the world on the internet, Glover still manages to make her radio travels relevant. Her description of Gene Hackman giving a petulant interview, her arrival and adventures in Las Vegas the very week that Art Bell was quitting his paranormal talk show (coincidence?), her white-knuckle drive through Beirut, all great stories.

Right away, we can see that this is not going to be the impromptu, go-anywhere journey that Investment Biker was.<br /><br />From almost skidding off the road in the rain just before they start their trip, to narrowly avoiding thieves in Africa when they unexpectedly have to sleep overnight in the car, the dangers often seem self-inflicted. After all, how can you cruise around in a fancy yellow sports car (with storage trailer and support staff) and not attract attention?<br /><br />I really can't blame Rogers for taking another trip, and what the heck, he's got the money, why not go first class? It's just that it doesn't make for an especially gripping book.	2005-07-31

This is nothing new. The presence of fashion magazines, fashion shows, and fashion museums tell us that something is happening here that goes beyond protecting our bodies from the elements.<br /><br />From this obvious thesis, Paztrizia Calefato leads us into less mundane observations. She explores the meanings of tattoos, watches, sunglasses, Barbie, makeup, and trends in clerical dress, among other things. She uses movies, literature, and philosophy to examine the significance of clothing (or lack of clothing) and accessories. Sometimes it all gets very deep as she ponders the semiotics of clothing, especially when she turns to philosophers such as Roland Barthes and Jean Baudrillard to make sense of it all. As someone who is mostly superficial, especially when it comes to clothing, I had no qualms about skimming these esoteric sections and skipping right to the good stuff.<br /><br />This included discussions of such seemingly trivial fashion choices as whether to wear a watch or not. Calefato thinks those who go bare-wristed are somehow rejecting the modern emphasis on precise time in favor of an imagined simpler era when we told time by the sun and stars. She cautions that these people are mistaken and that we are more likely to be heading for a Blade Runner universe in which we all have embedded microchips ticking off the time units. Yikes. It made me wonder how Calefato would react to Seinfeld's neighbor Kramer, who doesn't wear a watch simply because he can guess the time accurately enough for his vague purposes.<br /><br />That made me think of the Seinfeld episode in which Kramer is bullied by people who want him to wear an AIDS ribbon on his lapel. After 9/11 it became de rigueur in the U.S. to wear an American flag pin on one's lapel. TV news readers wore them and even the President sported one a few days later for an important speech. Since then, he has never been seen in public without the flag pin. Will there come a time when the lapel flag can be abandoned, like the flags that flew from so many car windows for months after 9/11? Fashions change, after all.<br /><br />On an even more superficial note, I was delighted to learn that what in America is called a fanny pack and in Britain a bum bag (because \\"fanny pack\\" would be rude in Britain), is called a \\"marsupio\\" in Italy.<br /><br />More illustrations would have been welcome - there are none, other than the cover photo of a tattooed model. The Clothed Body contains material for many potential discussions such as the watch/no watch or flag/no flag arguments. What about dress codes? School uniforms? Veils? It seems a bit ironic that something as literally on-the-surface as clothing should be the subject of such deep thought.been seen in public without the flag pin.

First, the \\"detective\\" is an autistic teenager. His autism leaves him unable to decipher people's emotions, which is usually a pretty important tool for fictional detectives. But he is more logical than Sherlock Holmes and he has exceptional observational skills. So when he decides to find out who killed his neighbor's dog, you can be certain he will crack the case.<br /><br />The mystery is not really the strength of this story. How Christopher, the autistic detective, perseveres to find the answers to his questions, and then how he breaks out of his claustrophobic world is the payoff for the reader.<br /><br />I can't say how accurately Mark Haddon has portrayed the hero of this story. Probably no one who isn't autistic can say. But how he paints Christopher's mother really struck me. While I can't imagine being autistic, I can imagine being the mother of an autistic child. Haddon shows Christopher's mother as unprepared and ultimately incapable of caring for Christopher. Without doubt she loves him, but finds his lack of emotional response and seemingly random bouts of screaming and other anti-social behavior too much to cope with. It is unusual to read an account of a mother who has failed her children that doesn't also demonize her. Haddon resists and creates a realistic human being who, like her son, has limits she tries to transcend.<br /><br />As a mystery, the Curious Incident is okay, but as a story of people trying, successfully and unsuccessfully, to overcome their limits, it succeeds spectacularly.	2005-07-25

Dumas was young enough when her family came to America that she grew up speaking and acting as American as the other kids in her suburban neighborhood. The adults in her family had more trouble adapting to the peculiarities of American life, but they jumped right in anyway. Her father aspired to be a game-show contestant, her mother wanted to get along without learning English, and her uncle expected to lose weight without exercising. Sounds pretty normal to me.<br /><br />But it gets a bit serious, too, when they return to Iran at the wrong time. Dumas describes how they are caught up in events and how they manage to return to California. Dumas's story and her upbeat attitude make this an engaging memoir.	2005-07-19

In Weeds in the Garden of Words, linguist Kate Burridge compares the English language to a garden. There are some flowers that look lovely, but your neighbor, who considers herself a gardening expert, says they are weeds. Should you follow her advice and root them up? Maybe it depends on your definition of weed.<br /><br />Taking a completely different approach from verbal hygienists (Burridge's phrase) such as the ever-cranky Lynne Truss (Eats, Shoots & Leaves), Burridge observes the evolution of English, without making judgments. She discovers that quite often, what is now considered correct grammar, spelling, punctuation, or pronunciation, used to be considered wrong. And vice versa. Because language is always changing, it's difficult to pin it down at any point in time and declare once and for all that the double negative is wrong and that the direct object form of \\"who\\" must be \\"whom.\\" When people are using \\"incorrect\\" English every day and still managing to communicate effectively, who's to say what's wrong?<br /><br />Well, there are always plenty of self-appointed fusspots and arbiters of linguistic goodness (as Burridge calls them) who want everyone to follow the rules they learned when they were in school. I suspect that the only people who read that type of book are people who already know the rules and just want to catch the author in a mistake.<br /><br />For those who are interested in what unpredictable routes the English language is taking, Weeds is an entertaining collection of short essays that Burridge originally presented on the radio. She explores new words such as \\"earworm,\\" a term for the tune you get into your head and can't get out. She muses over new trends such as the tendency to pronounce words such as \\"assume\\" as \\"ashoom.\\" And she compares the different ways English is used in the United Kingdom, the United States, and in Australia (Burridge is Australian).<br /><br />As a recovering stickler, I enjoyed reading this enthusiastic celebration of English in all its forms.tic celebration of English in all its forms.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-18

The cover is colorful and cheerful. There are photos of the author, Hollis Gillespie, making silly faces on many of the pages. The reviews compare Gillespie to Erma Bombeck. The author bio says she is a flight attendant and language specialist, jobs that lend themselves to comedy routines. In short, this looked like a quick, funny book.<br /><br />Gillespie is no Erma Bombeck. I like Erma Bombeck, but Gillespie is better.<br /><br />When Gillespie wants to be funny, she can leave you hiccuping with laughter. Her chapter on a trip to X-rated Amsterdam with her family and another on her adventures as a bad translator are priceless.<br /><br />But most of the time, Gillespie is talking about her offbeat friends and downscale neighborhood, or about her unconventional childhood and her, um, eccentric parents. If she were inclined to dwell on how she was denied a normal childhood (whatever that is) and blame her parents for their faults, she would have plenty of ammunition. Instead, she refuses to be the victim. She looks back on the mistakes her parents made and seems to understand.<br /><br />The essays in BHHB are very short, most are only two pages. What Gillespie manages to pack into these short pieces is amazing. Gillespie is like one of those artists who paints a few strokes and you think, well, that wasn't much, but then you realize how much those few strokes reveal. The genius is in knowing when to quit and to let the viewer, or reader, fill in the blanks.<br /><br />So if the kicky title, the irreverent design, the promise of a laugh riot pull you into reading this, fine. You will not be disappointed. And you'll get a lot more besides.	2005-07-16

Yes, I love to read books and I've wanted to visit Hay-on-Wye ever since I first heard of it over twenty years ago. But books about how wonderful books are usually leave me cold. I'm not interested in collecting books, so the charm of the Nicholas Basbanes and Lawrence Goldstone genres eludes me.<br /><br />Paul Collins is more concerned with what's inside the books and he writes so well that it doesn't matter that his taste in books is entirely different from mine or from any other reader's. He seems to be interested in everything. He gleans curious tidbits from any book he happens to pick up and relates them in an entertaining way.<br /><br />In Sixpence House, Collins and his wife and toddler son are trying to find a house to buy in Hay, the Town of Books, and his first book is about to be published. This gives him a chance to talk about the characters of Hay and about the publishing business from an author's point of view. I love his thumbnail explanation of how to decipher bookcovers and the importance of a book's title (the question remains, why did his publisher go with the deadly title of Banvard's Folly over his intriguing choices, The Man With N-Ray Eyes, or simply Losers?). Another unforgettable episode is Collins's return to the U.S having lost his passport. Not exactly a warm welcome home.<br /><br />Sixpence House was so enjoyable, I may have to read Banvard's Folly in spite of the dreadful title. Sure, Collins and his wife were crazy to think they could move to Hay, but he got a book out of it at least, and what a great story.	2005-07-16

There is no self-pity here (except for the father); the whole family just gets on with their lives, one near-disaster after another.

I love memoirs, I love Amazon.com, and a story about a book reviewer who gets rich reviewing books for Amazon, well that sounds just fine to me.<br /><br />The first half of Amazonia is fast and fun. James Marcus gets his first \\"real\\" job as Amazon.com is taking off, when it is still an upstart company staffed by enthusiastic and smart people (Jeff Bezos asked all potential employees what their SAT scores were). He is hired as an editor, but finds he spends a lot of time working on web pages and packing books. It's okay though, because everyone has a stake in the company's success.<br /><br />By the second half of the book, Amazon.com has become a grownup company where everyone speaks in management cliches and tries not to brag about all the cool stuff they are buying now that they are fabulously rich. Marcus spends all of his time at work or with people from work and his marriage is on the rocks. No wonder. He has become an Amazon.com bore.<br /><br />Marcus describes the giddiness of the early Amazon.com years well, as the young employees throw themselves into a project that is as likely to go belly up as it is to make them millions. It's a huge gamble and you want them to succeed as much as they do themselves.<br /><br />Marcus, a great fan of literature, goes off on egghead-y tangents from time to time. If you are not a modern literature geek, then these parts are easily skipped. He also gets rather involved in the technical aspects of the web site a bit more than seems entirely necessary.<br /><br />Amazonia brings to mind David Denby's recent American Sucker, but Marcus avoids the worst of Denby's wallowing in self-pity, and doesn't dwell on his foundering marriage and only hints at an affair with an Amazon colleague.<br /><br />Amazonia is a fun book for people who like rags-to-riches stories, especially those who dream of making their fortunes at something as unlikely as book reviewing.	2005-07-03

I first read about Bruce Schneier in an eye-opening article by Charles Mann in the September, 2002 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. It seems that you don't have to make the false choice everyone is agonizing over between security and liberty. You can have both.<br /><br />Schneier's book expands on the ideas in the article. Although Schneier is a technology fan and it is his livelihood, he realizes that sometimes a live security guard can provide better security than cutting-edge (but still fallible) face-recognition scanners, for instance. He explains why national ID cards are not a good idea, and how iris-scanners can be fooled.<br /><br />These are ideas for security on a large scale, for airports, nuclear and other power plants, and government websites. For security on an individual or small business scale, try Art of the Steal by Frank Abagnale. But even if you don't run a government, Beyond Fear is a fascinating read about how your government is making choices (and how they SHOULD be making choices about your security and about your rights.	2005-06-29

I was expecting something like the excellent documentary Spellbound, which was about some of the kids who made it to the National Spelling Bee one year. I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Count Down is best when it is about the students, but author Steve Olson often digresses to talk about topics related to math. He discusses what genius is, how math is taught in the U.S., why there aren't more girls on the U.S. team, the history of math contests, and much more. These are all interesting and pertinent topics, but I found that what I really wanted to know more about was the kids themselves.<br /><br />Maybe a spelling bee is just inherently more dramatic since it takes place on stage, while the math contest takes place at desks and inside the contestants' heads. The whole notion of a math \\"team\\" in this case is misleading, since the members' individual scores are added together to determine the team score. They don't solve the problems as a team, although they train together. The top individuals are recognized as well, so I'm not sure what the point of a \\"math team\\" is.<br /><br />Still, I did learn some odd facts, such as that much of the behavior in nature that is considered inborn or instinctive, isn't. Day-old chicks who were thought to eat mealworms instinctively, fail to do so if the chicks' feet are covered. Young chimpanzees who supposedly have an inborn fear of snakes, do not shy away from snakes if the chimps' diet is changed. This sort of knowledge challenges the nature vs. nurture arguments regarding I.Q. and genius.<br /><br />Count Down is a good book about math education, but it doesn't have the drama or suspense that a good contest should have. For a good book about competition, try Cookoff, about cooking competitions in the U.S. For a good book about math, try either My Brain is Open or The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, both good biographies of Paul Erdos, eccentric Hungarian mathematician.Brain is Open or The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, both good biographies of Paul Erdos, eccentric Hungarian mathematician. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-26

Fiction writers turn everything into stories. The essays and memories in The Opposite of Fate read like short stories, with the pacing and structure of fiction.<br /><br />This is not a memoir, rather a collection of thoughts, essays, interviews, memories, even a prize-winning essay Amy Tan wrote when she was eight years old. The pieces at the beginning of the book are more light-hearted than the later ones. In one, Tan is surprised to find that Joy Luck Club has a CliffNotes version and is interested to discover what she was trying to say in her novel. Not only that, the CliffNotes biography doesn't quite match what she recalls from her own life. In another chapter, Tan tells how she became a bad singer in the Rock Bottom Remainders, a bad band. Her story of how Joy Luck Club was made into a movie is fascinating.<br /><br />There is a lot about Tan's mother, a huge influence in her life, both good and bad. When Tan turns serious, watch out. She has had several brushes with death, and her September 11 memories are out of the ordinary, as well. She also writes about how she came to be a writer and have her first novel published at thirty-seven.<br /><br />Most of these pieces are quickly read, and only one or two seem seemed too long.

So I guess I was not in the mood for another guy who's got it all and loses some of it. Boo hoo.<br /><br />The big difference between Canseco and Denby is that Denby can write. I loved Denby's first book and I enjoy his reviews and articles. And I even dabbled in the market along with so many others (although not with the amounts of cash he had to burn). So I thought Denby would have something to say to me.<br /><br />The market bubble is over and I find it just isn't as fascinating now as it was then. Debny thinks so, too, but I guess he'd already committed to writing this book. And his various obsessions (too late to be a mid-life crisis) are too personal and too common to be terribly interesting.<br /><br />Several reviews and blurbs have mentioned a similarity to Woody Allen, but I didn't see any humor here. Denby splices parts of movie reviews and magazine articles that he wrote at the time into the narrative and that is interesting, but the attempts to emulate the Great Books seem a bit forced. The Man With The Dutch Master's Face who shouts a stock tip to him in the street, then haunts his dreams, for instance. Honestly.<br /><br />Denby seems like a nice guy, and we can all sympathize with him, but I think I'll stick to reading his reviews.	2005-06-21

As a big fan of caper movies and con stories (Ocean's 11, The Thomas Crown Affair, Catch Me if You Can), I can enthusiastically recommend American Roulette.<br /><br />Richard Marcus (most likely not his real name, in fact, the name is the same as that of the actor in a TV series called The Pretender) tells of his successful career as a casino cheat. He started as a garden-variety gambler, lost all his money, found himself homeless in Las Vegas, and became a blackjack dealer.<br /><br />Marcus was recruited by a well-to-do casino rip-off gang and rose to the top over the years. He tells great stories about which casinos the gang hit, how they engineered the con, the trouble they ran into, and how they were nearly caught several times. The gang even made their way to casinos in Europe and Australia, although their base was in Las Vegas. The opening of casinos in Atlantic City and across the U.S. made for some easy pickings as well.<br /><br />American Roulette is not an instructional manual on how to scam the casinos. In fact, as Marcus points out, even if you were to learn the mechanics and technicalities of the scam, there is something more basic to the success of the con game and that is being cool under pressure. These characters are glaciers.<br /><br />American Roulette is a terrific read, and would make a fantastic movie.	2005-06-20

In the bookstore, it looked like one of those \\"inspirational\\" books they stock at the checkout counter, next to the gift books about angels and cats.<br /><br />But then I heard an interview with Lewis on NPR radio. The book was originally a magazine article in the New York Times Magazine. He summarized the story in a few minutes. A coach he had at his prep school (I didn't even catch what sport Lewis was playing) had changed his life by treating him, in a critical moment in a must-win game, as if he was the clutch player Lewis and every other kid dreams of being. Lewis rose to the occasion and the confidence he gained from the experience radiated to his academic work and beyond. But now, twenty-some years later, the parents at the private school are pressuring the headmaster to oust the coach. They say his heavy-handed ways are hurting their kids' self-esteem. Lewis ended his radio summary by revealing that publicity from the New York Times article had resulted in the coach keeping his job, although the school was now looking for a new headmaster.<br /><br />What a great story. It was short and had conflict as well as a satisfying ending. But then I read the book, which is simply the article, unchanged.<br /><br />In it, the coach has a temper that seems uncontrolled and frightening, even to the adult Lewis. Coach takes a second-place trophy his team won and smashes it on the locker room floor, indicating his disgust at not winning first. He refuses to drive home when the team has lost, obsessively walking miles through New Orleans at night (yikes) to punish himself for being a loser. When the team doesn't hustle enough, he makes them practice sliding headfirst on concrete-hard dirt until they are bloody and bruised.<br /><br />Lewis's interviews with former students of the coach sound like Stockholm Syndrome sufferers, people who've been kidnapped and held hostage but come to sympathize with their captors. The former players speak with admiration as they describe how Coach intimidated them. Lewis tells of being on the mound in another clutch situation as Coach shouts ridicule at him from the dugout, distracting him enough so that he misses a grounder that hits him in the face, causing him to black out.

I still feel like an imposter when I do something grown up like spackling or buying insurance.<br /><br />Some of Zevin's confessions have been done to death (\\"I take pride in my lawn\\", \\"I engage in home improvement projects\\"), but he's easy to take and makes even these stale subjects fun to read about.<br /><br />Where he really gets funny though, is when he is ticked off. One of the funniest essays is about his participation, as a freelance journalist, in an etiquette class for eight- to twelve-year-olds. The teacher is prim and snooty and Zevin is outraged at the idea of a class where the kids are taught to suck up to the teacher and to be as uptight as she is. So he befriends the class slacker.<br /><br />Another chapter that stands out is when Zevin and his wife visit Zevin's younger (by fifteen years) brother in Spain. His brother is spending a semester abroad, just like Zevin did so many years ago. He compares the diaries he kept as a twenty-year-old single dude in Denmark with his \\"adventures\\" as a thirty-five-year-old married guy who thinks he might be catching a cold.<br /><br />Anyone who is funny is compared to Dave Barry, and Zevin is reminiscent of Barry sometimes, but I hope that he doesn't go stale like Barry and start to pull out the booger jokes whenever he's hard up for a laugh. No matter how much you are reluctant to grow up, there are some things that just aren't as funny coming out of a fifty-year-old.	2005-06-10

There are accounts of the advent of convenience foods, the literature of food, the rise of cooking shows on TV, and the phenomenon of cooking contests such as the Pillsbury Bake-Off.<br /><br />The topics seem loosely connected, with no particular conclusions drawn. But it's a pop history book, not an academic tome, so sit back and enjoy an entertaining look at food from several historical angles.<br /><br />Shapiro talks about the post-war need for convenience food. At least, manufacturers wanted there to be a need for convenience foods, whether American cooks agreed or not. There were a lot of experiments in the first days. Successful products included concentrated frozen orange juice and fish sticks. Unsuccessful product proposals included canned deep-fried hamburgers and concentrated distilled water. (I suspect if Shapiro is having us on with that last idea.)<br /><br />The section on domestic literature was especially fun, although a lot of it had little to do with food. Shapiro discusses Shirley Jackson, Erma Bombeck, Peg Bracken, Bette MacDonald, Jean Kerr, and the Gilbreths of Cheaper By the Dozen fame, among others. She reveals that there was often a big difference between their supposedly non-fiction works and their actual lives. I look forward to rereading these old favorites with this new information in mind, as well as looking up some authors Shapiro mentions that I was not aware of.<br /><br />The mini-history of Julia Child's career is entertaining, and the extensive bibliography is a treasure trove of further reading ideas.

I plowed into it, intending to read it in one- or two-hour chunks, in a few days. Big mistake.<br /><br />The essays in Small Wonder are depressing and serious for the most part. It starts with thoughts on September 11, 2001, and revives the theme often. While we were all obsessed with those events for some time, it was a bit jarring to return to that obsession over three years later. Not that it isn't relevant or that we aren't obsessing about our current crisis, the Iraq War and its consequences. And not that these things aren't obsession-worthy. It was just that after the mainly upbeat and diverse essays of High Tide in Tucson, I found these dark and troubling essays tough going.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I like Kingsolver's writing and I agree with nearly everything she says. I was just overwhelmed by the sadness and gravity of the subjects. I should have read the essays in shorter spurts. Instead I overdosed myself into a funk. Fortunately, a brisk walk to the nearby creek to check up on this spring's first batch of ducklings put things back into perspective.<br /><br />I highly recommend High Tide in Tucson, and I recommend Small Wonder with a warning -- read in in small doses.	2005-06-06

I can't resist a good con book or movie. The Great Escape, Ocean's Eleven, The Thomas Crown Affair, I love them all.<br /><br />I had been hoping for a collection of cons and clever schemes like those in Catch Me If You Can, Topkapi, American Roulette. Instead, The Art of Intrusion has one good con, a few stories of hacking vending machines and websites, and a lot of \\"advice\\" for people tasked with computer security. As in The Art of Deception, Kevin Mitnick's previous book with William Simon, the advice consists mostly of common sense tips such as don't give your password to the guy on the phone who says he's the repairman.<br /><br />This may be a good book for people who are responsible for computer security where they work. There is plenty of technical advice about back door attacks and firewalls, and scads of code for those who those who want the details. But Mitnick emphasizes social engineering as a greater risk to your computer security and I believe him. It's a lot easier to just ask someone for the password or for access to the system than it is to invade from the outside. And most people don't expect a hacker to be the friendly voice on the phone who says he's Don from the home office and chats you up before casually asking for the entry code.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are looking for a good book about cons, I'd recommend The Eudamonic Pie by Thomas Bass, American Roulette by Richard Marcus, or Catch Me If You Can by Frank Abnagale.	2005-06-04

The idea of being a beauty queen doesn't appeal, I am not from the South, I don't think the only thing men are good for is buying me jewelry. So for several years after The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love came out, I ignored it. Then I heard Jill Conner Browne on the car radio and nearly ran off the road from laughing.<br /><br />The Book of Love is a ridiculously disguised excuse for Browne to dish out heaping servings of advice. It is all good-natured and upbeat, if not always prim and ladylike, if you catch my drift. The Sweet Potato Queens, who receive the ceremonial title of \\"Tammy\\" upon reaching Queendom, all know the magic words to get a man to do anything you want him to. They know the Best Advice Ever Given in the History of the Entire World. And they reveal all in this, the first Sweet Potato Queens book.<br /><br />Fortunately, it is not necessary to dress up like a Sweet Potato Queen to benefit from the Book of Love. In fact, the SPQ costumes look rather like drag queen ensembles. In any case, if you get the audio version, just be careful while you're driving.	2005-06-04

But in this country at least, it is almost impossible not to overconsume. Our president encourages us to spend more. Our vice president sneers that some \\"virtuous\\" people would have us conserve energy rather than use as much as we want to, at any cost. TV and other media bombard us with messages to eat more and buy more. Our financial advisors tell us to buy the biggest house we can afford. When was the last time anyone suggested saving money rather than \\"investing\\" it?<br /><br />Confronting Consumption tackles the problem from several angles. I'm afraid the larger global arguments Princen and his fellow editors and academics make are lost on me when they write of \\"commoditization\\" and \\"conceptualizing the consumption problem.\\" But in the final section they get down to ground level and talk about voluntary simplicity, Adbusters, and alternate methods of home power (off the grid).<br /><br />An especially interesting observation appears in Michael Maniates's essay about the voluntary simplicity movement. He attended a voluntary simplicity day at a university. Thousands of people showed up, many more than the organizers expected. They wanted to know about cutting living expenses, downshifting, and job-sharing. They were not at all interested in the Sierra Club presentation or other \\"save the planet\\" groups. It isn't that people aspiring to live simply don't want to help save the planet. They just want to do it in a more manageable way, one person, one family at a time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that won't undo the ecological, financial, and human damage already caused by overconsumption. For that, we will need leaders who at the very least acknowledge that overconsumption is a problem, not a virtue.	2005-06-03

A Round-Heeled Woman reads like a personal diary. So I have to hand it to Juska, it took courage to publish this book.<br /><br />I was expecting a light-hearted memoir of adventures and misadventures in dating, with the twist being that the heroine is 67 years old. This memoir is occasionally light-hearted, but more often depressing, when Juska reminisces about her lonely childhood, or her even lonelier marriage. And when she starts dating again, after placing the personal ad, well, sometimes, I just wanted to shake her. She goes out with a series of men who are unsuitable in one way or another. Married, bonkers, or just plain cads. But she gives every one a chance and then some.<br /><br />A Round-Heeled Woman is like watching Jerry Springer (but with an English degree), and I have no one to blame for reading it all the way through except myself.

Outwitting History works well on several different levels. Judging from some of the other reviews here, if you've ever studied or spoken Yiddish, or know people who do, you'll find this story interesting.<br /><br />But if, like me, you don't know any Yiddish other than schmaltz and oy ve, and you aren't even Jewish, you can still enjoy Lansky's tale of saving hundreds of thousands of books and helping to preserve the history of what may be a dying language.<br /><br />As a college student, Lansky started salvaging Yiddish books that were being discarded. As word got around that someone was willing to shlep old books away, he became inundated with people cleaning out their libraries and libraries who couldn't use the books any longer. Lansky nudged a couple of friends to help him and it turned into a full time job, taking his unreliable pickup truck all over the East Coast and beyond to pick up cartons of books at all hours.<br /><br />Often when Lansky and his helpers arrived, there was a smorgasbord of food waiting for them and the person giving away the books usually had some tales to tell about how they acquired the books, or about what it was like to be Jewish immigrants in New York sixty or seventy years ago. In exchange for the books, Lansky and his friends got an education in a fascinating slice of American twentieth century history.<br /><br />After some twenty-five years of book salvaging, Lansky has a million and a half volumes stored in his National Yiddish Book Center. Although Yiddish is no longer the first language of many, thanks in part to Lansky, many people are rediscovering its literature and culture.	2005-06-01

Now Barry is on a new wife and has a brand new two-year old to write columns about. And he still thinks the word (and presumably the concept of) \\"booger\\" is funny.<br /><br />I picked up this book with mixed feelings. He seems to rely more and more on silly humor (boogers, exploding toilets, hilarious names for rock bands) rather than the classic columns of Dave Barry's Bad Habits (my favorite Barry book). And the jackets of his books always have him in some ridiculous pose. I keep saying, \\"This will be my last Dave Barry book.\\"<br /><br />But Dave Barry always comes through. I read this latest book cover to cover. His comments on the Republican and Democratic conventions were scathing, his observations at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City were deadly, and the serious columns at the end reveal that there is more to Barry than adolescent humor. (His essay from an earlier collection, written after the death of his mother, is a masterpiece.)<br /><br />So I will ignore the goofy cover photos, the inane titles, and the wacky cartoons, and just read what Barry writes -- solid, mostly humorous, essays.	2005-05-30

Garlic and Sapphires is funnier, louder, and more memorable.<br /><br />If you are new to Ruth Reichl's writing, you can enjoy this one without having read her previous memoirs. Reichl describes how she stumbled into writing restaurant reviews and how she got the premier gig for any reviewer, The New York Times. And then it really gets interesting.<br /><br />She realizes on the flight to New York for her job interview that the entire New York restaurant world will be stalking her, since a review from the NY Times can make or break a restaurant. Knowing that she will need to remain incognito in order to fairly evaluate a restaurant, she comes up with a scheme.<br /><br />Enlisting the help of an acting teacher she knows, she comes up with a disguise and a persona to go with it. It works and she is able to review restaurants undetected for a time. But when she suspects her disguise has been discovered, she has to create another, then another. With every disguise, Reichl comes up with a new character to fit it, complete with backstory. She throws herself into these new roles, becoming the person inside the disguise.<br /><br />One character turns out to be her recently deceased mother, giving her a chance to work out a few unresolved issues, another character is a woman her husband finds disturbingly attractive, and yet another is so unlikeable that she has to discard the disguise before she ends up alienating her friends and family.<br /><br />Reichl writes about each episode without holding anything back. They are hilarious, or poignant, or fascinating, or all three. The only thing that could have made this a better book would have been to discard the out-of-date restaurant reviews at the end of each chapter and replace them with photographs of Reichl in each of her disguises.hotographs of Reichl in each of her disguises.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-30

He knows which side he is on in every subject, and it is the right side. Anyone who doesn't see it his way is a fool, and he doesn't suffer fools gladly. So it was with decreasing enthusiasm that I approached the second half of the book. There, Dawkins lets down his bluster a bit in pieces on Stephen Jay Gould (his professional rival), Douglas Adams, September 11, and his own daughter. As Dawkins becomes more thoughtful and just a tiny bit less sure of himself, the essays become more powerful.A Devil's Chaplain was, for me, a good introduction to Dawkins, and I'm looking forward to reading more.	2005-05-27

I thought she relied too much on making herself to be the fat, ugly, stupid girl to get laughs, and that it was almost a throwback to the Phyllis Diller-type comediennes of the Sixties. But it was funny enough that I wanted to read more.<br /><br />In We Thought You Would Be Prettier, Notaro still is the often the butt of her own jokes, but somehow now she seems more Roseanne than Phyllis Diller. Even her bio at the end of the book is good for a laugh. My favorites were the story of the flippy-haired guy at the supermarket and her description of her day at driving school.<br /><br />I was also pleased to find her website (LaurieNotaro dot com) where there was a very funny piece about her misadventures with the supermarket self-check-out machine. There you can also read the story of how her first book was rejected seventy times before she finally self-published and then she was almost immediately contacted by an agent who sold that book and her unpublished second book. I love that story. And she has a new book coming out in November!	2005-05-27

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	The Far Side	The Other Side of Russia is part travel narrative, part social history, part memoir, part food writing. All these parts come together to make a terrific book.<br /><br />Sharon Hudgins and her husband Tom spent a year and a half in post-Soviet Siberia teaching business management for the University of Maryland's overseas program. As peripatetic ex-patriates, they were familiar with unfamiliarity. But they were still not prepared for what Siberia had to offer them.<br /><br />Join Sharon and Tom as they picnic with the Russian Mafiya, try to teach in an educational system that discourages questions and independent thinking, and ponder why a herd of horses is tangled in downtown rush hour traffic.<br /><br />In \\"Absurdistan\\" it is just one perplexing thing after another. The electricity and water in their poorly-constructed apartment building work only intermittently. But in spite of such challenges, they make friends and entertain regularly. Cultural differences mean that the same friends who swoon over delicacies such as wafer-thin horse liver slices rolled with layers of horse fat, are unable to enjoy a Hudgins Tex-Mex feast.<br /><br />Hudgins's previous work as a food and travel writer are evident here, and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that she writes fiction as well. The narrative is effortless and the stories she tells are by turns engaging and frightening.	2005-05-22

If the President or Secretary of State tells a joke, chances are everyone is going to laugh, whether the joke is funny or not. People tend to hold Letterman to a higher standard, humor-wise. So the guy who writes jokes for the President only has to make the President laugh. Which may explain why I didn't find Mark Katz's book very funny.<br /><br />While I was interested in how someone becomes a joke writer for the President, I was not as interested in Katz's rather boring, suburban New Jersey childhood. I really did not like his revenge-tinged stories of teachers who found him disruptive in class, or his kiss-and-tell story of how, after he became successful, he got lucky with a woman who wouldn't go out with him in college.<br /><br />The story drags until he gets back to the political stories. I enjoyed reading about Katz's dealings with Madeleine Albright, Al Gore, and Bill Clinton. I even enjoyed the story of the bizarre negotiations to get Big Bird and Barney on the same stage with the President. And the book ends with a pretty good story, too.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the jokes Mark Katz tells here are not funny. On the other hand, George Stephanopolous, Al Gore, and Katz's friend, Fisher, come across as very funny. And what is with the footnotes? I usually read footnotes, but Katz goes crazy with them here, and this isn't even the sort of book that really merits footnotes.<br /><br />So, my advice is to quickly skim the first half of Clinton & Me, skipping the footnotes, and enjoy the second half.	2005-05-19

Camilleri's Inspector Salvo Montalbano stories and Leon's Commissario Guido Brunetti novels are so good that I wanted to read them all and was delighted to find that both authors have written at least a dozen books each. Only five or six of Camilleri's have been translated into English from the original Italian so far, but more are on the way. And many of Leon's are out of print in the U.S., but perhaps that will change in the near future.<br /><br />These are compelling mysteries that draw you right in and keep you hooked right up to the satisfying, if not always happy, conclusions. But that almost goes without saying. What keeps you coming back for more are the characters and the extras, in this case, the backdrops of Sicily and Venice.<br /><br />Stephen Sartarelli's translations of the Camilleri books are marvelous. It isn't hard to translate a book, but it is difficult to do well. He strikes the perfect balance of translating most things, but turning to explanation when translating would destroy the mood. There are a few pages of explanations at the end of each book, describing pastas and exchange rates and cultural references. For instance, he translates education-impaired cop Catarella's rough speech into something Brooklyn-esque, but he explains Boghonghi the Dwarf, apparently a famous character to most Italians, but not to Americans. (Example of a bad translation -- I remember seeing a dubbed version of the French movie A Man and a Woman that completely destroyed the romantic mood when they replaced the Edith Piaf song playing on the car radio in the original version with a dubbed ragtime tune.)<br /><br />I can't say which series is better, I tend to think that whichever I am reading at the moment is my favorite.	2005-05-17

As it is, author Linda Lawrence Hunt had to supplement the skin and bones story with some history of Norwegian immigrants and of women pioneers in general. I've been fascinated with stories of immigrants and pioneers since I was in grade school, and this is an unexpected story of both, with an almost unbelievable twist - Helga Estby and her nineteen-year-old daughter Clara, walk across the United States hoping to win a $10,000 prize in a contest.<br /><br />The trouble is, the only information that survives about the walk that took place over a hundred years ago, are newpaper accounts written as the Estbys made their way across the country. There are no diaries or memoirs, and there were no family tales passed on to succeeding generations.<br /><br />Hunt reconstructs the trek with the newspaper articles and with the little information the surviving family members and acquaintances can provide. It is a fascinating story, and a surprisingly controversial one. Many people at the time condemned Helga for abandoning her husband and children in Washington State while she and Clara pursued a thoroughly unladylike adventure. From what we can tell, Helga was not out to prove anything, she was trying desperately to get the money the family needed to keep their home and land. But the strain Helga and Clara's absence caused in an already stressful time of economic depression was too much. Many of the family couldn't forgive Helga, and Clara left home soon afterward and even changed her name. We aren't told if this move and name change were due to fallout from the walk or if there was some other reason.<br /><br />Bold Spirit is a great story of an immigrant family's struggle to make it in America (before there were any safety nets), of two women's unprecedented walk across an entire continent, and of an historian's search to reconstruct the remarkable events.	2005-05-05

And you can even eat all the candy you want, if like Almond, you are an ectomorph who never gains weight.<br /><br />Candyfreak, the book, is a journey through the history of candy in America, and one man's relationship with candy. When Almond is talking about candy -- visiting candy factories, reminiscing about candies past, or discussing the attributes of candy, he is quite good. I enjoyed being reminded of some of my old favorites such as U-No and Kits and Sixlets. But when Almond gets more personal, I found myself skipping chunks of the book. This surprised me, because I usually like memoirs and personal essays. I found I just didn't care about Almond's personal quirks or even his politics, even though I usually agreed with him.<br /><br />An index would have been helpful, to look up those specific candy bars you are wondering about.

I remember it made me feel excited about the possibilities of learning, discovering, and creating. For years, I searched for the series on video tape and finally found it unexpectedly in a fabulous art supply store called Flax, in San Francisco. Watching it again gave me the same feeling that anything is possible. Reading Charles Nicholls's new biography of Leonardo gave me a similar feeling.<br /><br />I have never understood the people who criticize Leonardo for starting so many things and not finishing them. If we knew only of the works he had finished, we would still consider him a genius. Perhaps abandoning a venture that he didn't consider worth finishing freed him up for an even better project. Maybe he kept his mind sharp by flitting from one thing to another. If he were alive today, I have no doubt that we would cure his attention deficit disorder with drugs.<br /><br />Charles Nicholls is a careful biographer and qualifies all his conclusions about Leonardo. This is probably wise when dealing with a subject who lived five hundred years ago. Still, Nicholls is straightforward concerning Leonardo's relationships with his students and others.<br /><br />In addition to the usual stories of Leonardo's fascination with nature as a boy and his failure to build a giant bronze equestrian statue, Nicholls has some new information. We find out what kind of jokes Leonardo told and that he was a vegetarian for the last half of his life. Nicholls includes Freud's speculations on Leonardo's relationships with his parents and the effect that may have played in the composition of his paintings.<br /><br />But Nicholls sticks mostly to primary sources for his information, including Leonardo's many notebooks and letters. Although Leonardo was a private man who wrote all his notes in a peculiar backwards \\"mirror writing,\\" possibly to keep people from easily deciphering them, he wrote about everything, from how to prepare pigments for a fresco to how to keep healthy and clean (freshen your hands with rose water to smell pleasant).

(No Really, They're Not Kidding)	When I saw the cover of this book, with Ben Stein and his co-author lounging by the pool, bags of gold coins and gold ingots at their side, I thought it would be a send-up of investing books. Oops.<br /><br />In spite of the kicky title and irreverent writing style, this is a genuine attempt to educate investors. It's full of rather conservative, long-term advice. Look for undervalued stocks. Don't jump in and out of the market. Diversify. When Stein and DeMuth talk about Market Timing, it is not a reference to day trading, rather to buying stocks when they are cheap. Buy low, in other words.<br /><br />Their thinking on dollar cost averaging is refreshingly sensible. Instead of the Bob Brinker style of investing a fixed amount every month (or year or whatever) regardless of cost per unit, you should wait until the stock is cheap, then buy as much as you can. This assumes the investor has a brain, and enough discipline not to mess it up, which seems to be Brinker's fear.<br /><br />Anyway, there isn't much new here. It's solid investing advice, breezily presented, so if you need a refresher, or are new to investing, this isn't a bad book to start with.	2005-01-06

Twitchell makes a coherent argument that those who pay ridiculous prices for things they don't need make it possible for the rest of us to pay lower prices for the same things. Then, what used to be a luxury to one generation (indoor plumbing, cars, computers) becomes a necessity for the next.<br /><br />But somehow, Twitchell seems guilty about all this. He even quotes Gekko (from the movie Wall Street), a bit sheepishly. He praises \\"first-users\\" (those who buy the first VCRs, etc. at high prices) while sneering at the stereotypical yuppie with all his toys. Professor Twitchell mocks the voluntary simplicity movement by picking the most hypocritical example he can find, of a back-to-nature advocate who buys acres of her neighbor's land. But he ignores such aspects as not spending more than you have, reducing the amount of stuff you own, enjoying the occasional luxury rather than shopping as a habit.<br /><br />Interesting reading if you are fascinated by our consumer culture, but a bit confusing as the professor tries to decide where he stands on over-consumption.	2004-12-31

Francine Prose examines gluttony as one of the seven deadly sins, and discovers that we may need to update that list. Gluttony is no longer a sin in our society, but obesity is. We don't scorn a thin person who eats a lot, in fact, we envy her. (Oops, another deadly sin rears its ugly head.)Prose looks at the history of gluttony, in the church, in paintings and murals (check out Diego Rivera's Capitalist Dinner), and in popular culture. She uses literature, philosophy, and overheard conversations and jokes to make her points. For such a thin book (108 pages with color photos and index), there is an awful lot to chew on here.	2004-12-31

Reading about watching television is less of a waste of time, maybe. But what about writing about watching television? There is an entire genre of academic writing now that treats TV shows as if they are worthy of analysis and even of deconstruction. In the past year I have read books about Gilligan's Island, the Simpsons, the Avengers and other spy shows, and now Seinfeld. Although the authors, usually university professors, treat their subjects seriously, they also seem to be having fun. This is the case with Seinfeld and Philosophy.<br /><br />All the contributors to this volume are fans of Seinfeld and sprinkle in catch phrases from the shows here and there. They are also scholars of philosophy who can toss off references to Kierkegaard and Wittgenstein at will. As a reader with a tenuous grasp of philosophical teachings, I cannot evaluate the academic value of these essays. However, I did notice that several Seinfeld episodes were worthy of multiple comments by these professors. They seemed especially fascinated with the episode in which George decides to do the opposite of what he normally does. They also liked the Bizarro episode, in which Elaine befriends a group of friends who are the opposite of Jerry, George, and Kramer. Are philosophy professors just obsessed with contrary behavior or is there some deeper meaning here? I suppose we'll have to wait for a book on Seinfeld and Psychology for the answer to that.<br /><br />Sarah Worth's essay on whether Elaine is a feminist or not is curious. Worth acknowledges that Elaine is the most stable, career-wise, of the gang (aside from Newman). She dates on her own terms and is treated as an equal by the rest of the characters. While Elaine confesses at one point that she would like to get married, I don't think that can eliminate her from the feminist category. And yet, Worth decides that Elaine is not a feminist, because she is too immoral and unethical. Elaine has too many boyfriends, is self-centered, and doesn't want to have children. While the professor might not admire Elaine, or want to be her friend, she should acknowledge that Elaine is a feminist. Not that there's anything wrong with that.many boyfriends, is self-centered, and doesn't want to have children.

The range is broad - these essays are all over the place, from Susan Orleans's amusing visit to a taxidermy convention to Kathryn Chetkovich's confession of jealousy of her boyfriend's (the never-named Jonathan Franzen) success as a writer.<br /><br />Two of the essays were written decades ago, one by Tennessee Williams and one by James Agee, but newly rediscovered in 2004. Jared Diamond and Oliver Sacks are informative yet readable as usual and well worth your time. One of my favorites was an off-the-wall essay about knitting from the Harvard Review by Kyoko Mori. I have never knitted and would not have thought that an essay about yarn could be so entertaining.	2004-12-28

They came to Central Asia in a fit of midlife restlessness, and get rather more than they bargained for.<br /><br />Europe was too easy and South America too familiar. So they decided on Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet Republic, and Burkett got a job as a journalism teacher at the Kyrgyz university for a year. After September 11, they decided to stay and stick it out. After all, the attacks had been in their home of Manhattan, halfway around the world.<br /><br />For the next year, in between teaching her journalism classes, Burkett and her husband visited Afghanistan, Mongolia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and most of the other -stans. Remarkably enough, they faced almost no physical threats, and nearly everyone they met was fascinated with their American-ness. In every country they visited, even during the Afghanistan war and the run-up to the Iraq invasion, they were welcomed by the people, if not by the border guards, and made to feel welcome.<br /><br />What Elinor and Dennis experienced is what America has experienced internationally -- people everywhere disagreed with American foreign policy, but they welcomed actual Americans. Nearly everyone they encountered, in every country, resented American \\"meddling\\" and arrogance, thought that America had brought the New York attacks on themselves, and yet were perfectly willing to share their homes with two American travelers.<br /><br />As a journalist, Burkett knows how to tell a story. So Many Enemies, So Little Time starts off on September 11, 2001, then fills in the gaps a little later. She is very opinionated, and never hesitates to tell her guests and students what she thinks or if their arguments are weak. In spite of this candor, she doesn't seem to fit a blatantly left or right political stereotype. By the time I finished the book, I still couldn't predict who she will vote for in November, 2004. This works in her favor, because if there had been an obvious bias to the right, I wouldn't have been inclined to continue reading, and I'm sure those with a right-wing tendency would feel similarly if the book had been obviously left-leaning.<br /><br />It's a real eye-opener to find out what the average Uzbek or Iranian thinks about America, especially during the events following September 11. By the end of the year of travel, Burkett has reached her limit of hearing America being criticized for interfering too much and for not helping enough. She lashes out, at least on paper, at those who hold America to a higher standard than other countries and who conveniently forget the sins of former Western powers like Germany, Britain, and even Belgium. But her exasperation clouds her reason -- she tells her journalism class that although America had allowed slavery once, we realized it was wrong and stopped it. She doesn't mention that the actual people holding slaves had to be forced to give up slavery after a bloody war. I wonder why she doesn't cut the old European empires the same slack she does for America?<br /><br />So Many Enemies, So Little Time is a real slap-in-the-face of a book.

My favorite player was Gene Tenace, but I loved baseball and could appreciate players from the National League, too, even a Reds player. Johnny Bench was my second favorite catcher.<br /><br />If this is the book that Pete Rose thought would change the Commissioner's mind, then he is deluding himself about more than his problem gambling.<br /><br />Rose has a zillion excuses for his gambling -- it's legal, he has attention deficit disorder, it's just the way he is, he doesn't drink or hit his wife, his father gambled, etc. He just wants to be treated the same as everyone else. Except that he also wants special treatment for having more hits than Ty Cobb.<br /><br />My Prison Without Bars (how's that for a self-pitying title?) tells the story of Rose's life. He's just a regular guy who swears and spits and scratches and likes to bet on just about anything. But he loves baseball more than all that and he's really good at it.<br /><br />I can't imagine this book changing anyone's mind. Rose portrays himself as a victim, hanging out with people who took advantage of him, being treated unfairly by Giamatti and Kuehn and now Selig. He takes credit for everything good that happens and blames someone else for everything bad. The good ol' boy style of the narrative gets old fast.<br /><br />It seems that interest in Rose's situation is limited. Most fans of the game formed an opinion about Rose's suspension years ago, and there is nothing here to change one's mind. At this point, Rose reappearing to press his claim once more is a bit sad. Rose says he wants to move on now, and maybe he will.	2004-10-31

Most of the pieces in My Kind of Place have appeared in The New Yorker Magazine and others. They cover a wide range of offbeat topics.<br /><br />Since these articles are all over the map, so to speak, you may end up picking and choosing. Some are very short and personal, others are longer and more journalistic. Some of my favorites were the piece on baby beauty pageants, in which Orlean brings out the rather creepy aspect of such contests very subtly; the taxidermy convention, also a surreal occasion; and a stay in Midland, Texas, a dusty oil town whose claim to fame is being the hometown of George W. Bush.<br /><br />Orlean's travels outside the States were also good, just not quite as interesting as when she explores the weirdness that exists in our own back yard.	2004-10-31

Even though I don't particularly want to be a clerk or a trader in Chicago or New York, it was fascinating to read about it. Cari Lynn's story of her two years as a clerk in an aggressively masculine job is easy to read, a result of her background and years of experience as a journalist. She describes how she got the job, how she learned to do the job, and the day-to-day routine of the work.<br /><br />She really gets going when she describes some of the characters she got to know. One of my favorites is the eccentric Alice, who trades all morning at home, then holds court all afternoon at the dining room at the Board of Trade. Knowledgable in many subjects, she is obsessed with trading and tremendously successful at it. Cari Lynn learns a lot from her.<br /><br />You can learn a lot of terminology and ins and outs of the trade from this book, or just skim the more technical parts and enjoy the atmosphere and the unbelievable tales of what goes on inside as millions of dollars change hands, sometimes deliberately, sometimes by accident.<br /><br />Leg the Spread reminds me of several other recent \\"on the job\\" books I've enjoyed: Richard Yancey's Confessions of a Tax Collector and Zac Unger's Working Fire.	2004-10-30

Lots of third world, poverty-stricken, overpopulated cities. I can't say how much the kids got out of places like that, but it certainly made them stick close together for safety. And they were really glad to get back home.<br /><br />The best parts of 12,000 Miles were the chapters written by the daughter, Rae. Even though she was going through some rough times as a teenager in New York, she still seemed more together than her father.

He discusses America frankly, past (loves New York, hates the suburbs near Stanford University) and present (the reaction to September 11). He reminisces about wars, academia, and jazz.<br /><br />About the only question he doesn't address is when and why he changed the spelling of his last name. Unimportant perhaps, but curious.

Anna Funder has written about the Stasi in a way that sometimes seems like fiction, other times like memoir, and ultimately like an exceptionally readable history.<br /><br />The Berlin of Funder's book is post-Wall Berlin, but it is as gray and paranoid as the Berlin of John le Carre's spy novels. Funder seems depressed throughout, and it is no wonder. She spends all her time interviewing former \\"Ossis,\\" East Germans who were victims of the Stasi or who were former Stasi themselves. Even her irrepresible rock musician friend reveals that his band was declared \\"non-existent\\" by the Stasi. The secret police were so thorough that he cannot find any evidence that his group, which recorded several albums and was quite popular in the East, ever existed.<br /><br />Through Funder, we hear from Miriam, who nearly made it over the Wall at age sixteen, but was caught, jailed, and blacklisted. Shortly after she married, her husband was arrested, then the Stasi showed up at Miriam's door to tell her that her husband had killed himself. She refused to believe the obvious lie and the subsequent funeral was a bizarre farce. Decades later, Miriam is still trying to make sense of it all, still searching for clues to explain what really happened.<br /><br />Frau Paul tells of her newborn son whose East German doctors risked their careers by smuggling the infant to the West because it was his only chance to survive a life-threatening condition. Frau Paul was denied permission to visit her baby unless she agreed to help the Stasi trap an acquaintance of hers. She desperately wanted to see her son, whose condition kept him in hospital for years, but knew that if she agreed to help the Stasi just once, she would be theirs for life. The child was well-cared for, but was growing up with only the hospital staff as his family. When he left the hospital at age six and returned to his family in the East, he was polite but distant with the parents who were strangers to him. Forty years later, Frau Paul still considers herself the traitor to her country and failure as a parent that the Stasi told her she was.<br /><br />Not all of the stories are tragic. Funder learns of a woman the Stasi tried to recruit to spy on her co-workers. The woman agreed, then went to work and cheerfully told everyone that the Stasi had recruited her to be a spy. Since her cover had been blown, she was no longer useful to the Stasi. They never bothered her again.<br /><br />Funder visits the office of the \\"puzzle people,\\" workers who put shredded documents from Stasi files back together. The papers reveal who the Stasi was watching, what they discovered, and who the informers were. Ossis may now request to see their files, but many of the files have yet to be put back together. The director tells Funder that at the rate of an average of ten reconstructed documents a day per employee, it will take forty puzzle people 375 years to reconstruct all the shredded documents. And, he explains, \\"as you see, we have only thirty-one employees.\\"<br /><br />Little by little, Funder allows us to realize that the Stasi does not exist as a curious and irrelevant moment in history. The torture devices in the Stasi museum and the thousands of bags of shredded documents that recall the abuses of power are evidence of a government that still haunts the lives of millions of former Ossis. It had seemed so powerful, but when the end came for the Stasi, it was without violence in a peaceful revolution of people who were just fed up.When he left the hospital at age six and returned to his family in the East, he was polite but distant with the parents who were strangers to him.

Right. And wrong.<br /><br />Hearing the essays in small doses is a lot different than reading a whole book of essays at once. What seems like witty sarcasm in a two-minute on-air reading, starts to seem like bitchiness after several chapters. Also, Peters' voice reminds me of British comedian Alexei Sayles (short, bald, mad), so when I saw Peters' photo on the book, I had to drastically revise my mental image. What had seemed funny coming from a short, bald, mad man, didn't seem as funny from a slim, handsome man.<br /><br />Of course, I don't blame Peters for these complaints, and my only suggestion to the reader of Gullible's Travels (and I do recommend that you read it, especially the chapter on the Lizzie Borden Bed & Breakfast) is to read it a chapter at a time, rather than all at once.

After all, I have not read Idiot Girls and I had mixed feelings about Autobiography of a Fat Bride. I thought Notaro made fun of herself to the point of becoming a throwback to the old-style comediennes like Phyllis Diller and Totie Fields. We've moved beyond that kind of &quot;I'm just a stupid, ugly woman&quot; comedy, and I was dismayed to see a revival.<br /><br /> The good news is that I Love Everybody is really funny. In it, Notaro makes fun of her bosses, her family, and herself, but has toned down the &quot;I'm so fat and ugly&quot; spiel a bit. She writes so well and is so funny that you know she doesn't really need to beat herself up for laughs. She can take just about any subject and find a sharp-edged humor in it.<br /><br /> My favorite bits were the story about her first meeting with the new boss while she is struggling with allergy symptoms, her trip to Disneyland, her trip to Costco in which she is determined to be pleasant to everyone, and the final chapter in which she has a final confrontation with the boss. You go girl!<br /><br /> I loved Notaro's story of how she spent seven years trying to get her first book published, then gave up and self-published. An agent saw the book, contacted her, and next thing you know, Notaro is about to go on a national book tour and her book is number 12 on the NY Times bestseller list. Pretty good for an idiot girl. Pretty good for anyone.	2004-08-01

He thinks the Pentagon policy of witholding military cooperation to movie producers who don't portray the military in a positive way is wrong. Operation Hollywood is filled with entertaining examples of how producers have butted heads with the various branches of the military.<br /><br />While Ivan Reitman practically rewrote his movie comedy Stripes to accomodate the Army, Clint Eastwood refused to give in to the Army's demands for change. Eastwood even wrote to his friend President Reagan for help, but no dice. The Marines did not demand the fundamental changes the Army had, so Eastwood was able to make Heartbreak Ridge with only minor changes, such as making his character a Marine.<br /><br />Robb's argument is that the military services are for the benefit of the people, not the propagandists at the Pentagon, so they should not be able to exercise so much control over Hollywood. But if the producers don't want to play ball with the Army, they can build their own military sets and buy their own tanks and hire their own soldier extras. It's just a lot more expensive that way, and many producers would like to find a way of making the movie they want (within reason) while taking advantage of the huge cost savings of using military bases and personnel.<br /><br />What's important for the viewer of movies and television to realize is how much control the producers do allow the military. When you watch Jag on TV or see Saving Private Ryan at the theater, it's a mistake to forget the deal with the devil the producers may have made to save a bundle. It's nothing new - Shakespeare rewrote history to make his plays palatable to those in power.<br /><br />In the end, what we have is another reminder that what you see on the screen ISN'T REAL. Who would've thought?	2004-07-31

There are few long explanations of diplomatic and bureaucratic ins and outs. Albright focuses mainly on personalities, her family life, behind-the-scenes stories, and the Big Picture. In other words, she condenses all the parts I would have skipped anyway.<br /><br />Albright's enthusiasm is evident throughout. She doesn't downplay her excitement at being appointed Ambassador to the U.N. and Secretary of State. She obviously wishes she still were Madam Secretary. She shows us a different side of world leaders. Hear Igor Ivanov, Russian foreign minister, singing in a revue; watch Albright cause Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to have an apoplectic fit. She talks about juggling day-to-day concerns with conducting world diplomacy (the big hats were for bad hair days). One of the best chapters is about her spur-of-the-moment trip to Poland, just as the Solidarity uprising was about to explode.<br /><br />A fascinating book, a brilliant career, and a remarkable woman.	2004-07-30

This almost put me off, but I was intrigued (perversely, I guess) by someone who did not consider a chance to spend a semester in Florence to be something to jump at. What was the matter with this woman?<br /><br />When her husband tells her the university they both teach at is sending him to Florence for a semester to conduct a class, she just doesn't want to go. By being a reluctant traveler, Gerber is able to show how Florence managed to captivate her in spite of herself. Rather than going to Italy as an already-intoxicated tourist, she resists at first, but it is Florence, after all, and even she comes to love it. I found this an excellent antidote to the gushing let's-move-to-Italy (or France) travelogs.<br /><br />And she isn't just taken with the usual Florentine charms of museums, churches, wine, and food. She discovers the thrift shops and grocery stores that most tourists would miss entirely. As a temporary resident, she has to deal with the landlady and the staff at the local Chinese restaurant.<br /><br />I almost gave up on this one, but am very glad I kept going, and suspect that is what Gerber intended all along.	2004-07-29

No more fatty meals, no more salty snacks, and while we're at it, no more cigars. Cosby has a few things to say about this disturbing turn of events.<br /><br />This reads like a Cosby monologue, almost stream-of-consciousness, whatever's on his mind. It's funny, but mostly in a low-key way, not like a stand-up routine with lots of laughs. He reminisces about the old days, when he ate whatever he wanted, such as four buttery croissants for breakfast, with jam and extra butter on each one. He talks about his new regimen of sensible portions. Sure, the doctor tells him, you can still have pepperoni pizza, but just one slice. And only every three months.<br /><br />One of the funniest bits is the story of his mother, who is amazingly resourceful at hiding her favorite forbidden food, pork chops, from her grown children, who try to keep her on her diet.<br /><br />This is a funny book, but it made me hungry. . .	2004-07-29

There are no recipes in this book. Although I do enjoy reading food books by people who cook, it's nice to get the view from an unadulterated eater now and then.<br /><br />Trillin uses this book to highlight foods that he can't get at home in Manhattan, and that is a list that is getting shorter all the time. In fact, you can get exotic foods almost anywhere now. And that is just why he has a hard time luring his daughters back to New York from the West Coast. They can get New York bagels and anything else in California.<br /><br />I love Trillin's dry humor and skepticism. This is my first Calvin Trillin book (although I have enjoyed his magazine essays) and I'm looking forward to reading his past works.	2004-07-28

I had never heard of Gellhorn, but was immediately taken with her no-nonsense reporter's style of writing. I scooped up all her non-fiction and some of her fiction. After reading both of Carl Rollyson's bios of her (one written before she died, against her wishes, the other right after her death), I thought I knew a little about Gellhorn. After reading Moorehead's bio, I found out just how little.<br /><br />This is likely to be the standard text on Gellhorn's life. It is complete, readable, and doesn't pull any punches. You get Gellhorn, warts and all, and there are plenty of warts. There was a lot of information here that I hadn't known, and wouldn't have guessed. It may even be too much information. I think I may know more about Gellhorn now than I really wanted to.<br /><br />Martha Gellhorn was a terrific war reporter, a great non-fiction writer, a competent author of fiction, and a fascinating person. Moorehead's biography captures all that and is well worth your time.	2004-07-28

Shortly after finishing City of the Soul, we went to Rome and enjoyed many of the walks he described. Not only that, the maps on the end pages are excellent, and the small size of the book makes it an ideal book to take along.<br /><br />  Murrays' mother was Italian and he grew up in Rome, although he was just as at home among Americans and British. While guiding us through central Rome and the discussing the history of the landmarks, he talks about growing up with his journalist mother and her lover. Murray's Rome is populated with artists and writers and this is both a great walking tour as well as a revealing journey of post-war Rome.	2004-07-27

But now I see that the paperback edition has been renamed Pagan Holiday. Ecch.<br /><br />I don't know if Perrottet had any say in what his book was called, but taking his pregnant girlfriend on a cheap and energetic tour of Rome is something he did have control over. I'm sure he was exaggerating for comic effect, but Perrottet comes across as being a bit too macho Aussie. The hotels he and girlfriend Les stayed in are squalid and uncomfortable. Les tries her best to keep up with him on his Roman walkabouts, but she is apparently not in Olympic form in her later months of pregnancy. Is he crazy? Is she crazy? According to the book jacket they're married now, so maybe it wasn't as bad as it seemed.<br /><br />The idea of retracing the ancient Roman route and describing it then and now was a good one, like those books they sell at Pompeii, with photos of the ruins of Pompeii today, and overlays showing Pompeii as it was in 79 A.D. Perrottet is enthusiastic, if a bit impatient, and has an infectious affection for ancient Rome.<br /><br />So, if you can put aside your sympathy for Les, you will enjoy Route 66 A.D.

By the end of every book I read about Russia, I am relieved that I don't live there. No matter how upbeat and positive the authors are, and they are all pretty optimistic, they come back home having had a huge dose of Russian reality.<br /><br />Lori Cidylo is fantastically optimistic. Even though her Ukrainian parents try to tell her that Russia is no place for her, she takes her college degrees in Russian and journalism and goes to Moscow to freelance. To freelance! She gets a job at a U.S. newpaper bureau there and begins to settle in.<br /><br />Nothing is easy. Finding an apartment when there are no rental listings or yellow pages is a challenge. Buying a clothes washer is a major project. Finding someone to reupholster her garish sofa is a wild goose chase. She even has to iron her dollar bills (American currency is accepted for many transactions) because no one will accept them unless they are clean and unwrinkled. And don't get her started on the problems with dating Russian men.<br /><br />But all that seems trivial compared to being in Moscow during the showdown between Yeltsin and his rebellious Parliament. Cidylo dodged tanks, snipers, and thugs to get her story. Everyday life in Moscow had trained her well for being a reporter in a war zone. Having survived traffic that jumped sidewalks without regard for pedestrians and hooligans who fired automatic weapons at random, Muscovites (and Cidylo) went about their business despite the revolution, because it might go on for months, after all.<br /><br />Cidylo's writing style is smooth and easy to read. Her training as a reporter is apparent. The prose is spare and free of unnecessary description. Five stars!	2004-07-25
US	52545721	R1SCEBAJ8FCVCU	1551681919	769828319	Other Losses	Books	4	23	36	N	N	What to Believe?	The controversy over claims of American mistreatment of German prisoners at the end of World War II had completely escaped my attention until last week. There was a Reuter's wire story (July 7, 2004) about how the Abu Ghraib photos brought back painful memories to some German survivors of American camps. The story seemed fantastic -- mass starvation of prisoners of the American Army, but the reporter quoted witnesses, cited documents, and interviewed historians. Why hadn't I heard of this before?<br />I did an internet search and found only a few references to the American prison camps in Germany at all. Some of the sites were conspiracy-fueled drivel. Many of the references to the camps could be traced back to the same University of Hawaii professor. And some of the claims in the news story were questionable. One former prisoner claimed his weight fell from 176 lb. to 110 lb. in one month. Is that even possible?<br />James Bacque's book, Other Losses, seemed to be the only book that had been written on the subject. I found it and read it. Bacque is a Canadian writer and has done an impressive amount of research, both by digging into documents and interviewing people who were there. He scoured the records of the U.S. Army, of the French government (which received German prisoners for use as slave labor from the American Army), and of the German towns where prison camps were located. He questioned former Army officers, journalists, German prisoners, and French witnesses.<br />What Bacque claims is not unbelievable. Abu Ghraib, the carpet bombing of Southeast Asia, and Andersonville are part of our history. Other Losses has not convinced me though. How could the deaths of a million prisoners have been hidden for so many years? There would have been more evidence, witnesses, survivors. The reasons Bacque gives for the lack of more evidence doesn't stand up: that the Germans themselves felt so collectively guilty over their own war crimes that they kept quiet; that the records were destroyed; that American journalists were spoon-fed Army propaganda. Not completely convincing.<br />There is enough evidence here to convince me that the American camps for German prisoners in Germany were criminally substandard. That there was a certain amount of hatred for Germans seems likely. Americans, from enlisted guards to Eisenhower himself, may well have decided to exact a bit of revenge. After all, Eisenhower decided the prisoners did not need to be accorded the status of prisoners of war, and therefore did not merit Geneva Convention treatment. But it seems unlikely that the death count was anywhere near a million.<br />That the number of deaths in Other Losses seems exaggerated unfortunately takes away from what is still a pretty remarkable chapter in history. If Bacque had resisted extrapolating the figures and had gone with a more conservative estimate, the story would have been just as alarming, and might well have been received as a more credible story. Instead, critics can discredit Bacque's story on the basis of incredible numbers and ignore what is actually a mostly believable and tragic blot on the &quot;greatest generation.&quot;records were destroyed; that American journalists were spoon-fed Army propaganda.

Then I got completely wrapped up in this fun and readable book. I even read the parts about shows I'd never seen and shows I had seen, but didn't like.<br />If you are a fan of these shows, you probably already know a lot of the trivia that Wesley Britton has included here. But I'll bet that there are still some nuggets that you haven't come across. For instance, Diana Rigg quit The Avengers because she found out she was earning less than the camerman. The first thing the Beatles wanted to do when they arrived in Los Angeles was to visit the cast of their favorite show, The Man from U.N.C.L.E.<br />The chapter on I Spy tells about the difficulty producer Sheldon Leonard had in selling the show and the discussions about how the characters would deal with race. Another chapter discusses the relationship among the three Patrick McGoohan series: Secret Agent, Danger Man, and The Prisoner. Semi-spy shows like Wild, Wild West and spoof shows like Get Smart are treated as fully as the real spy shows like Mission: Impossible and The Saint.<br />Spy Television is a thoroughly enjoyable book. It left me wanting to search for videos of many of these old shows to see what I missed.	2004-07-16

Throw in the kicky title and a punchy attitude and it can't lose.<br />I enjoyed Griest's stories. Her writing style is light. I can understand the criticisms of one earlier reviewer here who thought Griest was too superficial and didn't learn anything. I'm not sure that's really the case, but Griest does keep her narrative in the moment, without spending too much time analyzing what it all meant. This makes for a smoother telling of the story.<br />Griest spends the most time in Moscow and knew years ahead of time that she would go to Russia someday. This section was not surprisingly the best part of the book. The part about Beijing was okay, in which Griest works for an English-language Chinese newspaper. She never fits in and is constantly reminded of the fact. Her journey to Havana is a spur-of-the-moment trip, and it is more fun than Beijing. She doesn't have to worry about upsetting the boss or embarrassing her friends. Even though she's there for only a short time, she falls in love. She also falls in love in Russia, but only after she has been there quite awhile. And she never gets close to having a serious relationship in Beijing.<br />Around the Bloc is a good first book. It isn't as good as Almost French by Sarah Turnbull, another book about a journalist who finds adventures halfway around the world. Although it's more revealing, somehow it isn't as personal. But I suspect that Griest will only get better and I look forward to more from her.	2004-07-09

No matter how religiously you read the newspaper, you will have missed or forgotten most of these stories. In fact, most of the stories are forgettable. But some of them will stick with you.<br />I enjoyed reading about a man who had lived in a terminal at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for over ten years. So that's where Spielberg got his idea for the movie! There is a story about twin girls who didn't know the other existed until they were sixteen and finally found each other. Shades of Parent Trap.<br />Some of the stories are a little too heartwarming to be believable, but who's to say? The first story of a man who helps a homeless New Yorker find his mother and get a second chance at life becomes too much when there is a follow-up story after a year that finds the formerly homeless man living with his mother and playing piano at church every day. I'd rather be homeless.<br />If you love stories about child prodigies and lost pets who find their way back home, or if you are a film director looking for your next big project, Tales from the Times may be just the ticket.	2004-07-07

Larry Ferstenou got my attention right away by mentioning two books that everyone who wants to retire early should read: Paul Terhorst's Cashing in on the American Dream and Joe Dominguez's Your Money or Your Life. He also talks about a few dozen other books that can help in your goal of early retirement, but those two are must-reads.<br />Ferstenou has written a good how-to book on retiring early, but if you are the sort of person who has figured out that you want to quit the rat race and live life at your own speed, you probably don't need a book. You have probably already crunched the numbers and figured out what you have to do. What this kind of book does is let you know that there are others out there who have done it already. It's kind of a pep talk to let you know that it's possible and that there are several ways to get there. And you probably don't need as much money as you think.<br />As a pep talk, You Can Retire Young! is excellent. Ferstenou has included plenty of nuts and bolts advice to reassure you that you are on the right path and also has an upbeat attitude that makes it easy reading. He gives resources, such as books and web sites, and cites examples from his own experience. By the time you are finished, you feel confident that you can do it, too.<br />In my opinion, you can get all the information you need to retire early from the Terhorst and Dominguez books, along with Elaine St. James's Simple Living and Amy Daczyczn's Tightwad Gazette. But you may need an extra dose of motivation now and then along the way, and You Can Retire Early! is one of the better books on the subject.	2004-07-06

But it is also a look at philosophy and psychology and human behavior and art and culture, using the face and its individual parts as jumping-off points.<br />For instance, we learn that the purpose of the eyebrow is to keep sweat out of the eye. But author Daniel McNeill goes on to observe that in different cultures and at different times, it has been fashionable for women and men to pluck out the eyebrows. And the main purpose of the eyebrow is communication. With it, we can indicate a wide range of expressions. McNeill uses Groucho Marx, John Belushi, Uriah Heep, and Charles Darwin to makes his points about eyebrows.<br />McNeill proceeds to deconstruct the eyelashes, and nearly every other bit of the face in much the same way, using French poetry, Elizabethan drama, 20th century popular culture, and smatterings of natural science to illuminate his descriptions. We learn that flight attendants routinely convince themselves that they like the difficult passenger so that they can deal with him more effectively. What does that have to do with the face? The flight attendants know that it is almost impossible to fake a convincing smile so they can only be effective if they believe they truly like the truculent boor in seat 14D. It's the same sort of logic that makes a successful telephone worker smile even though the listener can't see the smile. You sound different when you smile. Happier.<br />There are tidbits like this throughout The Face. If you find a discussion about Greek philosophers heavy going, hang on, McNeill will have moved on to Dracula or Mark Twain in a few paragraphs.<br />The Face was so enjoyable and informative, that I am quite puzzled to find that McNeill hasn't written any more non-fiction since this 1998 book.	2004-06-06

So while there are pieces here about conventional romance, such as Laura Fraser's Italian Affair, which she eventually expanded into a full-length book, there are also essays about love of books, of country, of food, and of travel itself. In other words, this is a garden-variety travel anthology. And it's a winner!<br />As with any anthology, you will enjoy some essays more than  others. Some of my favorites were Taras Grescoe's Absinthe Makes the Heart Grow Fonder about drinking powerful absinthe in Spain, one of the few countries where it is still legally sold; How to Buy a Turkish Rug by Laura Billings about how the experience of haggling over a carpet was more important than the carpet itself; and Laura Fraser's Italian Affair, in which she actually pulls off the feat of writing the whole thing in the second person and makes it work.<br />Other outstanding entries include Tampax Nightmares by Susan Hack about finding tampons in countries that frown upon such evil devices; The Last Tourist in Mozambique by Mary Roach, who does yoga with the president; and Lisa Michaels's The Man Who Loved Books in Turkey about packing books for the journey and what happens to the books you leave behind.<br />I love to read anthologies, especially travel anthologies. You get to read some old favorites, read new pieces by authors you like, and discover new writers. Don George is always dependable as editor. In addition to this collection, try his A House Somewhere and The Kindness of Strangers.	2004-06-01

Some of the people interviewed in the book are claiming to have been incorrectly quoted, and some psychologists take issue with Slater's scholarship and conclusions. Having been warned not to take the facts too seriously, I thought it would still be intriguing to consider the deeper questions posed by the scientists who performed the experiments described in the book.<br />And it was intriguing. Slater debunks the myth that B.F. Skinner raised his first child in a &quot;box&quot; in order to conduct an elaborate behavior experiment on her. The box turns out to have been a high-tech playpen designed and built by the doting father that Skinner apparently was. Another famous experiment which revealed that most people would torture another if encouraged by a benign authority figure was especially chilling in light of the Abu Ghraib torture by American guards.<br />However, I came away with the distinct impression that Slater is a nut. Slater seemed especially enthusiastic about recreating an experiment in which normal people pretended to be demented enough to enter a mental hospital, then reverted to normal behavior and waited to see how long it would be before they would be discharged. Slater checked into some eight different hospitals. She also took some of the anti-psychotic meds she was prescribed rather than tossing them.<br />She reveals that she was unable to recreate the experiment strictly, because under the original conditions, the pseudo-patients would be truthful after being admitted, but Slater actually had a mental hospital stay in her past, so she lied. And I simply didn't believe that bit about biting the ten-year-old chocolate bar in the Skinner House at first. As I read more of the book and learned more about Slater, it wasn't so unbelievable any more.<br />Anyway, Opening Skinner's Box is definitely an unusual book. It poses many thoughtful questions about the nature of humanness. It is well-written, but I can't vouch for how well-researched it is or how factual. It is extremely interesting and thought-provoking, and more than a little creepy.nature of humanness. It is well-written, but I can't vouch for how well-researched it is or how factual.

Author Marc Cooper interviews a cross-section of Las Vegas types (stripper, blackjack dealer, casino owner, homeless advocate), reminisces about the old Las Vegas of the Mob, discusses some of the recent local scandals (the Binion murder, the political fight over lapdancing regulations that local columnists dubbed &quot;G-Sting&quot;), and profiles celebrity Mayor Oscar Goodman.<br />If you haven't already read Hal Rothman's The Grit Beneath the Glitter and Pete Early's Super Casino, then The Last Honest Place in America is a fun introduction to the behind-the-scenes Las Vegas.<br />However, there is something about Cooper's book that does stand out, and that is his interview with stripper Andrea Lee Hackett. Not only is Hackett a bit older than the other strippers at 49, but she is a full-time labor organizer as well. Although Vegas strippers aren't unionized (yet), Hackett works with the ACLU and labor organizations to protect her colleagues' rights. She is extremely articulate on labor issues and admits to being a Socialist and a former machinist at Boeing. Oh, and she used to be a man.<br />It probably won't be long before someone does an in-depth study of unionism in Las Vegas. It is one of the few places in America where, because of unionism (and I am by no means an uncritical fan of unions), a hotel maid or a valet or dishwasher can make a decent living. This phenomenon is worth a book by itelf, and The Last Honest Place in America is worth reading if only for Andrea Lee Hackett's story.	2004-05-18

It answers questions you have about the current news, such as what is a spiderhole and how did it get its name? Or how do you pronounce Abu Ghraib? These questions and their answers aren't in the book, but you can find them in the archives of Slate.<br />The book compiles some of the more intriguing questions from the past few years, such as Could Bill Clinton become president again? (The short answer is yes, but don't hold your breath.) Who can be buried at Arlington Cemetery? What happens if you don't answer the census questionnaire?<br />Slate's reporters, in response to reader questions and often their own curiosity, find experts in the appropriate field and ask the question. They make the expert explain the answer until they understand it, then write a short column explaining the answer to their readers. In this way, we learn how to pronounce Niger, how to become a weapons inspector, and what is Ovaltine, anyway.<br />The Explainer is a compact book that is fun to read in small doses or all at once. The explanations are only about a page or two each and clustered into about two dozen short chapters such as Dining Out, Medicine, Flight, and Death. Although I usually read the Explainer online, I thought I'd catch a few that I'd missed. Either I missed a lot of these explanations or I have a really poor memory. Regardless, I enjoyed reading these Explainer columns and look forward to more Slate publications.<br />(My favorite Slate feature is Bushisms.)	2004-05-16

The essays in this volume are written mostly by young backpackers who are not professional writers. The lack of polish is somewhat compensated for by the enthusiasm that shines through, though not entirely.<br />Europe From a Backpack is a bit like the Travelers' Tales books, except that all the writers in the Backpack series are (so far) unknown. A few of the writers rise to the top of this collection, notably Lisa Cordeiro and Mike Riley. Cordeiro's two essays about living in Europe after a hitch in the Marines left me wanting to know more about her adventures. She writes as if telling a story, not just relating her experiences. Riley's essay is a funny, punchy story of how he found himself in desperate need of a restroom, then of new underwear in a small town in Portugal.<br />Pearson has a website to promote his &quot;From a Backpack&quot; books and to solicit essays. There are instructions for submitting stories, but no mention of payment if your essay is included in one of his anthologies. While most of the authors in Europe From a Backpack might be satisfied by the thrill of seeing their writing in print, I certainly hope Cordeiro and Riley, at least, were paid for their stories.	2004-05-13

The movie was just okay, and the movie was better than the book. To give credit, the movie was faithful to the spirit of the book, if not the details.<br />Tricia Stewart, the author of Calendar Girl, and the driving force behind the calendar, would have benefited from someone else writing her story. She rambles on at times and describes everything as &quot;brilliant.&quot; She comes across as sometimes overbearing and a bit of of a showoff, not unlike her character in the movie, Chris, played by Helen Mirren.<br />The story of a group of women in an English village who decide to raise money for the local hospital by posing for a nude, but tastefully so, calendar, is irresistible. But a story has to have conflict, so there are a few tossed in, and perhaps they really happened. Not everyone in the town thinks a nude calendar is a good idea, especially when it leads to an overdose of publicity. The families of the &quot;models&quot; feel neglected when the calendar becomes a hit and they spend all their time giving interviews and traveling. There are strained relationships within the group of women when some think that others (Tricia) are hogging the limelight.<br />But everything works out in the end, and they become temporarily famous, and make a ton of money for cancer research.	2004-05-12

Alice Thomas Ellis, who is best-known for The Summer Trilogy novels, also wrote the Home Life series, a collection of columns about her everyday life in Wales. Sue Townsend wrote the Adrian Mole stories and recently published a collection of columns about her everyday life called The Public Confessions of a Middle-Aged Woman. Amy Tan collects her musings and thoughts in The Opposite of Fate. Writers who are successful in spinning good stories seem to be able to take mundane situations and turn them into good stories. This is a real treat for people like me who read very little fiction.<br />So how does Marian Keyes's new book measure up? Under the Duvet starts promisingly, with a short piece about her life as a not-so-glamorous novelist, and a previously unpublished essay about the eight months she wrote a cosmetics column for a magazine. These are probably the best bits in the book.<br />Maybe you do have to enjoy the fiction of the author to also enjoy their non-fiction. I confess I have not read any of Keyes's fiction. There's too much in Under the Duvet about shopping and shoes for my taste, but readers of Keyes's fiction might find that a plus.<br />Some of the pieces are on subjects that desperately need an original angle, but are not getting it here. For instance, on her trip to Los Angeles, Keyes predictably mentions the smog, silicone enhancements, and botox, and the fact that no one walks. I probably wouldn't have noticed her over-fondness for the word &quot;eejit&quot; (idiot) if I had read these pieces over time, rather than in two days.<br />Still, I enjoyed reading these essays and columns, and although they haven't inspired me to read Keyes's fiction, I will continue to hunt down books like this. Anyone know of any others?	2004-04-10

It's memoir, essay, American West, magazine articles, all of that and yet not quite any of it. The title tells you how wide-ranging these pieces are, and it actually refers to only one of the essays in the collection. Even Amazon.com has had trouble pigeon-holing the book, since it appears here on a children's books page.<br />The strongest essays are the ones about Kennedy's family. The first piece is about visiting the site of her father's death in a plane crash twenty-five years earlier. She visits with her mother and they recall a time that Kennedy doesn't quite remember, when she was only three years old. By the end of the essay, you have a good idea of who Kennedy is.<br />Subsequent essays discuss her childhood, her friends, her relatives, and her long-time boyfriend. A chapter called Thanksgiving is one of the best essays, about her awkward relationships with the children of her boyfriend and with their mother, her boyfriend's ex-wife. The awkwardness comes to a head when one of the children is hospitalized and Kennedy realizes that although she has no formal or recognized relationship with the children, she feels responsibility and love for them.<br />For such a slim volume of essays, there's a lot to think about here.	2004-04-07

Paco Underhill, who seems to be a mall-lover, speaks to both enthusiastic and reluctant shoppers alike.<br />This book was originally subtitled A Walking Tour Through the Crossroads of Our Shopping Culture, which is more descriptive than The Author of Why We Buy on the Geography of Shopping. Underhill takes us on a walk through the mall, visiting malls throughout the world, and taking a look at some of the neglected areas of the mall. He brings along different specialists, such as an architect, a visual merchandiser (which used to be called a window dresser, but is now much more than that), and a teenage shopper. He and his guests deconstruct the mall and the mall experience. The tone of the book is conversational and amusing.<br />Perhaps the most surprising thing about the mall is how relatively unplanned it all is. I suppose I thought that every aspect of the mall would have been studied and designed for maximum profit, but Underhill reveals that this is not the case.<br />The parking lot is haphazard, the restrooms are almost afterthoughts, the mall map is useless, the lighting is inadequate, the outside appearance and entrance are uninspired.<br />You know how you never see a clock in a mall? I thought that was deliberate, like in the casinos, where you are encouraged to leave the real world behind and forget about mundane things like whether it is day or night. After reading The Call of the Mall, I can safely assume it is not deliberate, just something the designers never even thought of.	2004-04-06
US	52545721	RUJYH5UIFDRZC	0375408983	679367486	Elizabeth and Mary: Cousins, Rivals, Queens	Books	4	46	48	N	N	A Pair of Queens	Some have criticized Jane Dunn's history of Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots, for not covering any new ground. I find that the parallel biography format makes a new look at an old story well worth while. You may already know the histories of the two queens and their separate lives, but to read about them simultaneously makes vividly clear how intertwined their stories are.<br />Dunn's style is accurate and entertaining without being over-scholarly. The addition of details that other biographers have omitted is welcome. (She mentions that Elizabeth was nearsighted, for instance.) The narrative flows naturally from one queen to the other without seeming choppy. Just when you are starting to wonder what's going on with the other, the scene changes to keep you up to date.<br />I was somewhat disappointed with the way Dunn treats the murder of Riccio (spelled Rizzio in some accounts). While she discusses fully the repurcussions of the murder, she glosses over the actual sequence of events in one sentence, since the story &quot;is well-known.&quot; I think a popular history such as this is the perfect place to include a full account, both for those who are new to the subject and to re-acquaint the rest of us with a dramatic event.<br />Dunn, like many biographers, is attached to her subjects. She gives everyone the benefit of a doubt. This is surely the most sympathetic account of Lord Darnley that I have read yet. (Especially on the heels of the recent Alison Weir history of Mary and Darnley.) But she backs up her assertions and conclusions with solid arguments and thorough documentation. And although she says that people still tend to divide themselves into Elizabeth admirers and Mary supporters, she seems to have an equal bias for each queen.	2004-04-04

The book jacket has a cartoonish design and each page has a little atomic symbol by the page number. It's a small book, almost like a children's reader. It seemed to me as if it would be a quick, fun read.<br />Well, it was quick, all right. Author Ken Silverstein originally wrote this as an article for Harper's Magazine, according to the blurb. The article has been padded with several chapters on nuclear power, chemistry, and the history of the Boy Scouts. But The Radioactive Boy Scout is hardly a cartoon or a fun little story.<br />Although this is a story about how one teenager nearly built a nuclear reactor in his back yard, Silverstein wants us to know it is more than that. He emphasizes how David Hahn, the teenager, was neglected by his parents and not taken seriously by his teachers. If only someone had taken the time to take this boy under his wing, perhaps a near-disaster could have been averted. Certainly, the fact that there was no disaster takes the edge off the story, but unfortunately, we already know what can happen when teenagers don't get the attention they need.<br />I enjoyed the main story as well as the chapters on science and the Boy Scouts. Silverstein describes how radium-based products were sold in the early 20th century as tonics, lotions, and even suppositories, to improve one's health. He recalls filmstrips (remember?) and pamphlets that cheerfully told us to &quot;duck and cover&quot; in the event of a nuclear explosion. He uses a hilarious passage from P.G. Wodehouse to illustrate a common view of the Boy Scouts in their early days.<br />Although I share most of Silverstein's opinions on federal government, the nuclear power industry, the Boy Scouts, and inattentive parents, I think the story would have been more effective if he had left his editorial comments out. Describing David's father as &quot;pathologically oblivious&quot; is unnecessary. True, but unnecessary.	2004-03-28

I like the stories where the writer has actually moved to Paris or wherever, and is not just buying a summer home and expects to become a native. In other words, I liked A Year in Provence, and was not so fond of Under the Tuscan Sun.<br />In C'est la Vie, Suzy Gershman has indeed sold her house in the States and moved to Paris. She is newly widowed, which adds a slightly different twist to this story. Gershman tells how she managed to get an apartment and furniture, how she dealt with the French bureaucaracy without speaking much French, how she coped with losing her husband, and how she got back into the dating game. She keeps an upbeat attitude in spite of all the obstacles and becomes, as an acquaintance tells her, &quot;almost French.&quot;<br />C'est la Vie has everything going for it, and yet, I feel as if I should have enjoyed it more than I did. Granted, I was not aware of Gershman's Born to Shop series of books, so I ended up skimming the frequent and detailed shopping interludes. Apparently, she is also a celebrity of sorts, so she does a bit of name-dropping. She doesn't flinch at popping for regular trips to London to have her hair and nails done, so I'm afraid we run in different economic circles.<br />C'est la Vie reads more like a fantasy than like a travel memoir. I guess I was expecting to identify with Gershman, but after the affair with the wealthy Count, the New Year's Eve assignation with a handsome Italian at the Ritz, the purchase of a summer home in Provence. . .<br />Although I did enjoy C'est la Vie, I also recommend Almost French by Sarah Turnbull. It's written by an Australian journalist who travels to Paris, falls in love with a French man, and stays. Somehow, I found her story much more real.	2004-03-11

Honestly, I can't resist any anthology on food or travel, but so many are disappointing. A Slice of Life does not disappoint.<br />A Slice of Life is subtitled &quot;Contemporary Writers on Food&quot; and the essays range in time from the early 1950s to 2003, with the majority from the 1990s. Note also the emphasis on &quot;writers.&quot; With a few exceptions, these pieces are written by people who make their living writing, not by cooking or eating. Therefore, the standard is high, and the result is impressive. Russell Baker, Umberto Eco, Calvin Trillin, Isabel Allende, and Jane Kramer are among the fine essayists whose work is represented here. However, even the exceptions, such as Julia Child's memory of her first TV shows, are superb.<br />I enjoyed revisiting favorite authors: Anthony Bourdain, Adam Gopnik, Jeffrey Steingarten, Sallie Tisdale. And I always hope to discover writers I've never read. Now that I know about Nigel Slater and Jay Parini, I will be looking for more of their work. This is what I love about anthologies.	2004-03-09

As a reader of Atlantic Monthly for many years, I knew that William Langewiesche had been writing articles for them about aviation. I remembered one article especially, Slam and Jam, about air traffic control, that I read when it first appeared in the magazine in 1997. I was an air traffic controller at the time and read the entire piece with great interest, remarking to colleagues that I thought it was quite a well-balanced look at the conflict between union and management. My colleagues disagreed.<br />Six years later, and four years after I left air traffic control, I reread the article which appears as one of the seven chapters in Inside the Sky. This time around, the article didn't seem quite as even-handed to me. While Langewiesche doesn't seem to find either management or the union admirable, he really does a number on the controllers, belittling the work they do.<br />I could go on about Slam and Jam, but I really don't imagine that anyone outside the business of commercial flight would be interested in it in any case. If I hadn't had a professional interest in the subject, I doubt I would have read the article at all.<br />There are two chapters devoted to air crashes. Even as someone who has more than an average interest in aviation, I do not care to dwell on air crashes and other disasters. I read them when they first appeared in The Atlantic Monthly, and did not feel compelled to read them again. It seems that Langewiesche has made a second career (after a career as a pilot) of examining crashes and other disasters, which is a shame. Important as it is to understand the causes of air crashes, so that they may be avoided in the future, I wonder how necessary it is to wallow in disaster page after page for, let's face it, entertainment.<br />One chapter that lives up to the promise of the subtitle and that I found worth rereading was The Turn, about the physics of flight from a passenger's point of view. This is the sort of article that makes me remember how much I enjoy flying (as a passenger) and how I hate it when the flight attendant asks me to lower the shade so that others may enjoy the movie. The show outside is much better.found worth rereading was The Turn, about the physics of flight from a passenger's point of view.

It seems that publishers and publicists feel obliged, when pushing an author who is funny, to compare women to Erma Bombeck and men to Bill Bryson or Dave Barry. Sometimes they awkwardly compare a woman to Bill Bryson -- &quot;a female Bill Bryson!&quot; They never compare a funny male author to Erma Bombeck -- &quot;a male Erma Bombeck!&quot; But I digress.<br />Cheryl Peck has a voice that is all her own. These short pieces are not hysterically funny. They would not make a good stand-up routine. But they are very well-written. Peck turns seemingly mundane subjects such as growing tomatoes and her first chocolate malt into compelling essays. The pieces about her cat, Babycakes, wander precariously close to the edge of precious, but, to my mind, never go too far. The essay about not coming out to her father was thoughtful, and powerful in its understated style.<br />I especially love the story of how this book came to be. Friends of Peck convinced her to write down the amusing stories she told them and she finally did, and another friend helped her self-publish it as a book for her family and friends. And now here it is, doing quite well on Amazon.com and at my neighborhood bookstore and at the local library. Well done!	2004-03-02

Also Camille Cusumano's Big Night, about a meal in Sicily that seems at first like heaven, until it turns aout to be quite the opposite. Rachel Fudge's remembrances of her parents' cocktail hour contrasts nicely with Christina Henry de Tessan's memories of family dinners in Paris.<br />One essay even made me cringe, the repulsive After Birth by Alisa Gordaneer.

God knows I heard \\"pretty good for a girl\\" often enough when I was growing up. Once I started Tina Basich's book, I was hooked.<br />She tells of growing up in a Sacramento suburb and going to an alternative school where art and music were stressed. Her parents kept the TV in a closet only to be brought out for special occasions, such as the Olympics. Basich and her younger brother entertained themselves by drawing, composing and playing music, staging shows, skateboarding, and reading. By the time she went to high school (a public high school), she was accomplished in a number of fields and her hero was Nadia Comaneci.<br />Basich tells of discovering snowboarding, becoming a pro, losing a friend to breast cancer and organizing snowboarding events to raise money for cancer research and education, and having several close calls of her own on the slopes. She talks about competitions, travels, and romances. She has a easy-to-read conversational style and the book is filled with photos and drawings.<br />Snowboarders will enjoy the story of how she perfected the backside 720 over a 60-foot jump, as well as the descriptions of competitions and the name-dropping. And everyone who has heard (or said) the words \\"pretty good for a girl\\" will enjoy the success story of a focused young woman.	2004-02-09

Refreshingly free of academic jargon, it's filled with examples and insights into the meaning of women's hair at various times and in different cultures. Black and white photos illustrate.<br />In an especially interesting profile, Weitz describes an American woman who fell in love with an Egyptian Muslim while studying in England. They married and returned to the United States, where she learned about Islam and eventually converted. Then she started covering her head, even though her husband was adamantly against it. She continues to cover her hair and wear the hijab robe against her husband's wishes, because she likes the way men treat her when she is covered.

He tries very hard, hires a tutor, labors hours every day over exercises and audio tapes, but it just won't come. He spends months in France and still, he can't pass his exam.<br />Watson is a philosopher, therefore he must analyze the situation to death. He dissects his failure, perhaps it is because French sounds un-masculine, maybe he doesn't like the French, perhaps it is something deeper. Well, seeing as how he has evidence that his French really has improved by the time he leaves France, maybe he just set his goals unrealistically high.<br />The self-analysis gets tedious sometimes, but the story is interesting and understandable. Everyone has difficulty learning something, no matter how smart they are. And the observations of different cultures are eye-opening. Watson's story about an American who speaks fluent Japanese, traveling in Japan, being refused lodging in an inn because he didn't speak Japanese, even though the lengthy conversation with the proprietor took place entirely in Japanese, was amusing.	2004-01-28

The Cheating Culture describes an America where 74% of high school students have cheated on an exam, where parents pull strings to get their toddlers into the best pre-schools, and where it is standard practice to pad one's resume with non-existent degrees. Otherwise honest people under-report their taxes, splice into free cable TV, and over-report their insurance losses. Why do they do it?<br />David Callahan sees several reasons. One is that in the Winner-Take-All Society (brilliantly described by Robert Frank in his book of the same name), the rewards are huge. Another is that the risks are small -- even when people are caught cheating, there is little repurcussion. And in a society where so many are cheating, we are at a disadvantage if we don't cheat, too.<br />Most of the book is taken up with describing the (often fascinating) ways people cheat and what are the consequences, to the individual and to the community. When Callahan finally comes to what to do about this pervasive problem, he can only come up with rather mild suggestions. Parents should teach their children to do right, schools and businesses should conduct courses in ethics, the individual should &quot;be a chump&quot; and resist cheating and turn in anyone who does cheat.<br />This reminds me of the Seinfeld episode where Elaine threatens a cheating Jerry by saying &quot;Someday, something bad is gonna happen to you!&quot; and Jerry shrugs her off with &quot;No, I'm gonna be fine.&quot;<br />In a perfect world, things would even out, and cheaters would get their due.

He's got a million of 'em.<br />Richard Lederer's latest collection of essays about language ranges from puns to world English, from Ebonics to grammar lessons. Many of these selections seem somewhat dated. For instance, he talks about the differences between American English and British English by pointing out English-isms such as &quot;bob&quot; for a shilling (when did they last use shillings, about 1975?), and says that in Britain, &quot;billion&quot; means a million million, but I believe they use it to mean a thousand million, as in America, and have for a while now. References to Jackie Gleason, &quot;Saturday Night Live comedian&quot; Steve Martin, and Conan the Grammarian add to the &quot;blast from the past&quot; feeling of this collection.<br />Fans of Lederer will enjoy these pieces that include a transcript of Lederer on the Jim Bohannon radio show, a discussion of the pronunciation of &quot;nuclear,&quot; and many, many puns.	2004-01-13

The similarities are remarkable, but the differences are also significant.<br />Like Gellhorn, Johnson refers to her traveling companion as &quot;J.&quot; or &quot;Dr. M.&quot;. This can't be to hide his identity, since she also refers to herself as &quot;D.&quot;. Perhaps these are her pet names for him.<br />Also like Gellhorn, Johnson emphasizes the unplanned, accidental, and often unpleasant aspects of travel, since that is what people really want to hear about back home. There is a fine line between complaining and telling a great story about a dreadful trip. If you don't finish reading the first episode Johnson tells, you may end up thinking she is just feeling sorry for herself. Ever the professional storyteller, even in non-fiction, Johnson is actually setting you up for the twist at the end.<br />The big difference between Gellhorn's book and Johnson's is that Johnson is always a tourist, along for the ride. She often travels with the same group of people, doctors and their spouses, to international medical conferences with her husband. They stay for a few days, a week, sometimes a month. Gellhorn traveled as a journalist following stories, and often stayed longer, getting to know the people.<br />Natural Opium is an entertaining collection of essays, and Johnson knows how to make a good story out of chance encounters and bad hotels.	2004-01-10

Without having read the blurbs for Wife of the Chef ahead of time, I found myself being reminded of Anthony Bourdain's book. And although I couldn't put Kitchen Confidential down, I wouldn't want to know Mr. Bourdain.<br />Febbroriello seems to have all her nerves on the outside. She is certain that people can't appreciate all the hard work she does. She is a finicky eater and is sensitive about people's reactions to that. She looks younger than her years and is offended when others want to do business with someone who looks a bit older. And she is working in what is still, for the most part (Chez Panisse, notwithstanding), a testosterone-rich profession. No wonder she comes across as a bit prickly.<br />Wife of the Chef moves along briskly and doesn't pull any punches. Febbroriello dishes the dirt on the customers, the restaurant staff, and herself. No one escapes, although the Chef does come out the least scathed.<br />I'd love to eat at her restaurant and I enjoyed reading her book, but I think I might find her just a little exhausting to be around. Even on her (admittedly rare) days off.	2004-01-09

Susan Doran has written a complete, if brief, biography of Elizabeth I that hits all the main points of her life and rule. Nothing important seems to have been left out, and the narrative seems unhurried. One could read this book in a fairly short time, and have an understanding of Elizabeth's reign. However, for those who would like a bit more elaboration, Doran includes a Further Reading List at the end.<br />Doran's style is clear, engaging, and very readable. This seems to be a book intended for an adult reader, but it would be an excellent introduction for high school students (or even precocious middle schoolers), as well. The only spot where the narrative jars is when Doran briefly compares Elizabeth to Diana, Princess of Wales. Charismatic celebrities exist in every generation, and in twenty years, this reference may seem dated.<br />This is also an attractive book, apparently one of the first in a new series by The British Library. It includes many color photographs of portraits and documents throughout.	2004-01-04

Half the puzzles are of the type that he conducts with a call-in listener. This usually involves a series of word puzzles with short answers you can come up with on the spot. The other half of the puzzles in The Puzzlemaster Presents are of the sort that he leaves us with to solve during the week. They are harder and have one correct answer.<br />The first type of puzzle is fun, but the second type is my favorite because you usually have to do these in your head. I like to keep one or two in mind for occasions like being stuck in traffic or standing in line. They really make the time fly and you don't need pencil and paper. I find they are also great if you have trouble getting to sleep. Concentrating on a tricky word puzzle or arithmetic calculation sure keeps your mind from wandering all over the place.<br />And don't look for clever tricks with these puzzles. One thing about Will Shortz is that even though he loves puzzles, he is scrupulously fair. He gives you all the information you will need to solve each problem.	2004-01-02

It is so dense with information presented in a readable, positive style, that I think I'll read it again.<br />Doing Our Own Thing seems to have been written by McWhorter's evil twin. He assures us near the beginning that this will not be a John Simon-type screed bemoaning the degradation of language in America. Then he goes on to bemoan the degradation of language in America. He manages to be just as pedantic as any language maven about the fact that \\"Billy and me went to the store\\" is NOT an ungrammatical sentence, mentioning the same example at regular intervals throughout the book.<br />Doing Our Own Thing seems like a collection of the author's pet peeves loosely connected to make up a book. McWhorter is concerned about the lack of memorable public speech today and the decline in quality of lyrics, especially in musical theater. He is also annoyed by baggy pants, poetry, and Democrats.<br />In decrying the decline of American speech today, he claims that no public figure can extemporaneously concoct complex sentences and thoughts. Everyone speaks like a regular guy, or worse, like someone a regular guy can feel superior to. But I can recall Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton giving speeches, that while not memorable in a William Jennings Bryan or even John F. Kennedy style, were complex, yet clear. Bill Clinton's speech at the memorial service for the two security guards who were killed at the House of Representatives was eloquent, for instance.<br />McWhorter mentions screenwriter David Mamet as someone who is in touch with real speech and can write dialogue that is both authentic and dramatic. This was a particular surprise to me, since I recently saw Heist on video, a Mamet film, and was distracted from the plot several times by painful dialogue. Not only did all of the characters speak with the same voice, they said things like \\"cute as a bucketful of kittens\\" and \\"as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton.\\" If that is authentic speech, then I must be hanging out with a different crowd than McWhorter.<br />And so it would seem. McWhorter mentions, more than once, that he likes to go to piano bars where you can not only listen to show tunes, but sing along. He notes that there are few straight men at these bars, and for that reason, he finds them an excellent place to meet women. Indeed.<br />It is not surprising that someone who loves language enough to have made it his life's work would be upset at what he perceives to be the decline of his first langauge. But sometimes his complaints have little to do with language at all. He shows us a soap ad from 1929 that has six panels and quite a bit more text than the typical print ad today. Then McWhorter wonders whether ordinary people in 1929 would have used words like \\"dainty,\\" which appear in the ad (as he uses the word \\"exquisite\\" to describe this very ad). Perhaps a better observation is that few ads these days are as wordy because they need to get our attention fast. When was the last time you saw a 60-second commercial on TV? They used to exist, but now advertisers know they only have 15 seconds to get our attention. Is that a language problem, or something else?<br />Doing Our Own Thing is definitely readable and there is enough here to get you thinking (not unlike talk radio), but if you want to read a good book about language, I recommend Power of Babel instead.kittens\\" and \\"as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton.\\" If that is authentic speech, then I must be hanging out with a different crowd than McWhorter.<br />And so it would seem.

The dialogue is sometimes too clever by half, but more often than not, it actually works. So I can understand if the Beiderbecke books are not to everyone's liking. I have read the Beiderbecke Affair at least five times since I bought a paperback copy in London in 1994 (at Books, Etc., which was replaced by Borders and is still on Charing Cross Road near Tottenham Court Rd.).<br />It is my favorite of the three Beiderbecke books (Beiderbecke Tapes and Beiderbecke Connection are the second and third of the series). We are introduced to Trevor and Jill, Big Al and Little Norm, the gang at school, and the mostly incompetent bunch at the police station. Why has a beautiful platinum blonde offered to sell jazz records to Trevor? What do Big Al and Little Norm have to hide? How are Jill's English students getting extra copies of Tess of the D'Urbervilles? And how does Bix Beiderbecke fit in?<br />As you may guess, the mystery is secondary in these stories. The appeal is the interplay among the characters and the running gags. In the video version of these stories, the music is also a draw, with an excellent band playing the songs of Leon &quot;Bix&quot; Beiderbecke, jazz musician of circa 1930, who died tragically young, and whose cornet playing inspires Trevor and occasionally other characters, but alas, never Jill.<br />Best to start with the first in the series, as it is the best. Or see it on video and enjoy the music!	2003-12-25

They deconstruct their favorite TV shows.<br /><br />In Reading Between Designs, authors Britton and Barker examine the set designs and costumes in The Avengers, The Prisoner, and Doctor Who. They discuss the changing look of the Avengers over the course of the show, especially the costumes of Steed. In the first few seasons, when the show was only seen in Great Britain, Steed was expensively attired, but within the norms of his class. Later on, he became not only a caricature of upper class snobbery, but a fop as well. Apparently, this played better in North America.<br /><br />The Prisoner provides a wealth of possibilities for analysis with its contrived sets, carnival-like costumes, and the fact that no one really knows what it was all about. Never having watched Doctor Who, I skipped that section, but fans will surely enjoy the discussions of the designs of sets, gadgets, costumes, and characters.<br /><br />The authors have a very clear and readable style, without the jargon and psycho-babble one might expect in an academic text of this kind. They even acknowledge the annoying habit many of their colleagues have of talking about \\"reading\\" television or film. With plenty of black-and-white photos to back up their theories and observations, this is quite an enjoyable book.	2003-12-24

By following the advice outlined in these two books, we were able to quit our jobs in our forties and pursue other interests. We have been free of the daily grind for over four years now, thanks in part to Paul Terhorst, Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez (authors of YMOYL).<br />In a conversational style, Terhorst explains how he realized his job was sapping the life out of him, and how he used his skills as an accountant to devise a plan that would enable him to retire at 39 years of age. Unfortunately, the specific financial advice he gives (invest in high-yield certificates of deposit) is no longer possible. But number-crunching is not the most important message that Terhorst has.<br />Cashing in on the American Dream advocates a no-nonsense approach to determining just what you want in life. Do you want to be free of working for others? Then it might mean giving up your car and dinners out. But it doesn't have to mean giving up what you really love (or need). Terhorst and his wife, Vicki, have been retired almost twenty years now and have spent much of it traveling the world. They have health insurance abroad, because it's cheaper than U.S. insurance, and better.<br />The Terhorsts have their own website and I like to check in on them once or twice a year. The fact that they have made their plan work all these years is more important than any advice they have. Cashing in on The American Dream is an inspiring book. If they could do it, why can't you?	2003-12-24

What's new in this second edition of Burning the Tables in Las Vegas? Mostly Chapter 9 on Green Chip Play. If you have a copy already, it's probably not worth it to buy the new edition, but you might want to borrow a copy to read this short new chapter on low-roller betting. In a nutshell, Andersen tells you how to win with $25-$50 bets, but don't expect to make a living at it.<br />Andersen spends about half the book talking about the mechanics of blackjack, and only the first few pages cover the basics. The rest is strategy and tactics, and he brings Stanford Wong along to add his expertise. The other half of the book covers topics that are not specific to blackjack, but are just as important: history, psychology, money management, risk management, health, demeanor. It is difficult to say exactly how much of a professional gambler's success is due to playing well and how much is due to people skills, being alert, reading a room, and staying healthy.<br />This is an up-to-date book that takes into account the way casinos operate today, not twenty years ago. Andersen adds a lot of what should be common sense to the nuts and bolts of playing winning blackjack. You probably don't need someone to tell you not to piss off the dealer (or even shoot them a disgusted look when you're losing), but it doesn't hurt to be reminded. Especially by a proven winner.	2003-12-20

I found I wanted to know more about Karmel and his wife than about who had lived in his street two hundred years ago.<br />And the photographs!

Kanfer doesn't stint on the rest of Lucy's life, both before and after the Show, but I Love Lucy really is the star of this book.<br />Never having read a biography of Lucille Ball, this was all news to me, and I enjoyed discovering that Vivian Vance loathed William Frawley, and that Ball was such a stickler and control freak. Kanfer's style is easy and very readable, and there are plenty of photos to round things out, including an unexpected one of a young topless Lucille Ball.<br />If you are in the mood for an entertaining and, let's face it, unimportant, book, this one is worth the money.	2003-12-19

For example, Shortz tells us that clues always agree in number and tense. Seems obvious now, but I didn't know that until I'd muscled through some puzzles. A question mark after a clue means a tricky (possibly punny) answer, NYTimes puzzles don't tell you if an answer consists of more than one word, well you get the idea.<br /><br />Even though New York Times Crosswords to Boost Your Brainpower is an excellent intro to Shortz-era NYTimes puzzles, it is also a lot of fun for old-timers, too.	2003-12-18

He explores the movies, television, comic books, school newspapers and the school curriculum, literature, and the works of the students themselves. It's a compelling look back at a time when teens had to face the the prospect of oblivion at the very time when they were looking toward their own futures. How did they handle it?<br /><br />Atomic Narratives and American Youth never mentions the obvious parallel of teens then and youth now during a new era of War on Terrorism. The analogy isn't perfect, but it's similar enough so that a book about the decade 1945-1955 is particularly timely today.	2003-12-18

That way we get the views from both hikers. This really works, because as they make their way along the trail, we see their relationship develop. It's as if they realized that if they could make it to the end together, they figured they'd be able to face anything together.<br />They have their share of adventures, mishaps, and meet plenty of hikers and &quot;angels&quot; (people who help hikers along the way).

She touches on history, such as the first appearances of plates and utensils. But this is mostly about modern food history, specifically Tisdale's history, and by extension, our own.<br />Tisdale reminisces about the meals she had growing up, meat at every meal, recipes from the Betty Crocker Cookbook and Peg Bracken's I Hate to Cook Book. She contrasts that with the food in her life now, as a Buddhist, organic, small-is-better, locally grown sort of person. On a whim, she makes her macrobiotic daughter a grilled Velveeta and white bread sandwich and is not really surprised when her daughter loves it.<br />Tisdale discusses fast food (she still makes the occasional, disappointing, trip to McDonald's), eating out, dieting, and supermarkets. In a particularly interesting chapter, she ruminates on what makes Martha Stewart tick, and marvels at the way Martha kept correcting Julia Child on a TV appearance together.<br />Many of the chapters in this book first appeared as magazine articles, and I look forward to more articles and books by Tisdale about food.	2003-12-11

That is, I'd heard of the Pillbsbury Bakeoff, of course, and knew of chili contests. I had no idea there was a year-round series of national competitions, a la the PGA Tour or perhaps more appropriately, the Pro Bowling Tour.<br />The whole concept of a year on the competitive cooking circuit was a new one for me and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about it. Sutherland's reporter-style writing, lots of facts and descriptions, not too much analysis, really works. She examines the competitions, profiles some contestants, looks into the preparation for an event, discusses the history of cooking contests, and addresses the phenomenon of &quot;contesters&quot;.<br />I have to agree with another reviewer that photos would have been a welcome addition to this book, the few on the jacket are great, but left me wanting more.<br />Apparently, cooking contests are uniquely American. According to Sutherland, &quot;Through contests we embody the founding fathers' ideal... to make of ourselves what we can... Even if you are stuck in a dead-end job in a dead-end marriage on a dead-end street, in America you can rise above your station and reign supreme at the bowling alley or the dog show or the poker table.&quot;<br />Cookoff isn't really about cooking, it's about the competition.	2003-12-09

Frankly, that doughnut on the cover got my attention, and the fact that I had just heard about the Ignobel Prize on the radio, which the author of this book won several years ago.<br /><br />I enjoyed the chapter on The Physics of Sex, but had to read the notes to find out why a woman taking the antidepressant clomipramine supplemented her dosage with pepper. (You'll have to read it yourself, I don't want Amazon removing my review!)<br /><br />In addition to making science more accessible, Fisher makes scientists seem more human. He describes colleagues of his reacting to successes by singing, shouting, and one who removed all his clothes and did a series of handsprings. Now that is a happy scientist.	2003-12-08

Am I a Woman? asks a lot of questions, the kind of questions that make you ask even more questions. Eller uses anecdotal evidence and personal experience to make many of her points, and that makes this a very readable book. In this age of cross-dressing, transexuals, transgenders, and generally confusing messages from all directions, Eller explores what it means to be a woman these days. She may as well discuss what it mans to be a human being, it is that basic.I enjoyed Eller's convversational style and sometimes alarming frankness. Her section on the gender quiz at The Spark website was especially entertaining, and of course, by the time I finished this book, I was so perplexed that I had to take the quiz just to assure myself that all was well. (It was, thank goodness.)	2003-12-07

But not as big as the shock that Jan Murra got when her husband moved the family to France, then abandoned her and their four young children in an old farmhouse that lacked both heat and electricity.<br />Murra did not know anything about farming, about farmhouse maintenance, or anything about France, including the French language. And her marriage had just crumbled, apparently unexpectedly. So she sent the kids to school (they learned French pretty quickly), and went about learning to farm and how to make France home.<br />This is a remarkable story, free of self-pity, and full of  good writing. After spending ten years in France, the Murras returned to the U.S., and Jan Murra lets us know what she and the kids did once they got back (not all of them left France for good).<br />This is an unusual book, a real twist on the usual farmhouse in France story, and certainly more memorable.	2003-12-07

It introduced me to Ruth Reichl and Anthony Bourdain, whose books I might not have discovered if I had not read their excerpts here first.<br />By collecting material from a variety of sources (books, magazines, webzines, newspapers), Hughes has given us access to more, and better, food writing than we would have hunted down ourselves. The result is fabulous.<br />I was so impressed with Laura Fraser's piece on why she stopped being a vegetarian, reprinted from Salon.com. The topic is unexpected, the writing seems effortless, and she really made me think about the subject in a different way. Then I had to find what else she had written and was captivated by An Italian Affair. I also started reading Salon.com.<br />Read all the Best of Food Writing series, but be sure to read this one first!	2003-12-06

Cheever admits that his wife is earning enough money to support the family, so he is not going to starve if he doesn't take these low-paying jobs. Barbara Ehrenreich was a traveler in the world of poverty-level jobs, mixing it up with the natives, living as they do, as much as was possible for a successful author with a doctorate. Cheever is a tourist, sightseeing and participating as an outsider.<br />Cheever's book is meant, I think, to be a bit more fun than Ehrenreich's. And it is. While I admire the heck out of Ehrenreich and agree with her completely, I also appreciate looking at the light side of crappy jobs. I can remember flipping burgers and working the counter at McDonald's, and was in stiches over Cheever's stint at the sandwich shop.<br />If you are fortunate enough to be able to look at minimum-wage jobs from the outside, I think you'll find Selling Ben Cheever entertaining. This may not be the best book to read while you are waiting to be interviewed for your next job, though.	2003-12-05

For instance, I learned that there are no eyeholes in the Big Bird suit, so Spinney has to use a mini-monitor to navigate. Spinney's story of how he met his wife (several times) was entertaining, and I loved the description of the Sesame Street trip to China,with an impromptu limo ride with Bob Hope.Even the drawings are well done, by Spinney himself. Recommended!	2003-12-04

Although I am not university-educated, I enjoyed this book. I admit I skimmed some of the more eggheady bits (postmodern thought, for instance), but McCracken's analysis of the Domestic Woman in film, television, and advertising was fascinating. Her take on the women's roles in Best Years of Our Lives and A Letter to Three Wives was eye-opening. Give this one a shot.	2003-12-04

The USA from the Other Side of the Tray	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Waiting Tables for Godot	I confess, I skipped the short history of waitressing at the start of the book to go straight to the interviews. These stories are fascinating.<br />This could have been a depressing expose about the low pay and poor conditions inherent in waiting. But Owings evidently has quite an admiration for waitresses, and she manages to bring out the pride these women have for their work. Even waitresses who hate the job are proud of some aspect of what they do.<br />The diversity of waitresses interviewed was impressive: from truckstops to Chez Panisse, from Alaska to Louisiana, from the Forties to the Millennium, from poor waitresses to not-so-poor (there are no rich waitresses), from high school dropouts to PhDs.<br />This is a wonderful book to include with Nickel and Dimed and Waiting by Ginsburg.	2003-12-03

I had great hopes for Number 10, but time and events have made this kind of satire seem almost irrelevant. Don't get me wrong. I think our leaders deserve to be taken down a notch and ridiculed when necessary. It's just that these days, satirizing Tony Blair by dressing him as a woman (a rather handsome woman, at that) doesn't go far enough. He needs to be ridiculed on a larger scale. When Number 10 came out in England, it was probably cutting edge satire, but even this broad comedy is too subtle for such unsubtle times. I have no doubt that Sue Townsend is up to the task, and will be slicing the ruling classes with a sharper sword soon.	2003-12-02

Stephen Pollan's idea is that you'd be a fool to save your money for a rainy day. He says spend it now, which is contrary to what evey other personal finance expert advises. Take a round-the-world cruise, buy that new Mercedes, or better yet, lease it. This advice goes against the grain, and I found myself fascinated by such an original approach. It's tempting to adopt his methods and live for the present, but my advice is listen to the book, but don't take it too seriously.	2003-12-02
US	52545721	R14QL0CB69IP8	0374529035	51727880	Naked in Baghdad: The Iraq War as Seen by NPR's Correspondent Anne Garrels	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Fearless	Our family has been following Garrels' career since she was in Moscow with ABC. She is one of the best reporters anywhere. Her reports from Baghdad during the war were remarkable. She is fearless.<br />This short book makes me think that Garrels is not the sort of person who can patiently sit at home writing something longer than a dispatch from the front. I enjoyed reading about what happened &quot;behind the mike,&quot; but the narrative seemed forced. The e-mails from her husband seemed almost gimmicky, as if her editor was looking for a way to point up how brave Garrels was, without having her tell you herself. After listening to those reports from Baghdad, we don't need to be told she's brave. We know.<br />Although she tells us in the book that she has retired from reporting from war zones, I wouldn't be surprised to hear her reporting from the next hot spot, calmly, and getting the stories that everyone else missed.	2003-12-01

Disclosure panders to the worst fears of innocent victims of ... harassment accusations.  The trouble is, things like that do happen, so you can't resist reading to see how Crichton's characters handle these muddy situations. The characters themselves are flat and not memorable, but I find I have to find out how Crichton will deal with such politically delicate topics.<br />Rising Sun is a bit dated now that Japan is no longer the economic force it once was.  Still, it wasn't long ago that Japanese interests seemed on the verge of buying up Hawaii and the West Coast and it could happen again. At least, that is what you'll think as you read Rising Sun.  I started the book on a flight from San Francisco to San Diego.  Midway through the flight, I looked around the plane and realized I couldn't understand any of the conversations or read the titles of the books and magazines my fellow passengers were reading.  The flight was filled with Japanese tourists and businessmen.  I could feel Michael Crichton's paranoia.	1998-03-29
