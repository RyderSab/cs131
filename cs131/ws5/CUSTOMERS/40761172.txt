In essence he  blames Clinton because the author is an intellectual light weight, ingnorant, and he know &quot;Clinton bashing&quot; will make him a few bucks.<br />It's often forgotten, but Ronald Reagan's eight years in office witnessed a marked increase in acts of international terrorism. In fact, terrorists killed far more Americans during the 1980s than during the 1990s. In 1983, Hezbollah suicide bombers attacked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, killing 63. Later that year, in October, a 12,000-pound bomb destroyed the Marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 Americans--the most deadly terrorist strike against the United States until September 11. In March 1984, Islamic terrorists kidnapped, and eventually killed, a CIA officer. The following month, Hezbollah killed 18 American soldiers in an attack on a restaurant near an airbase in Spain. Two U.S. military personnel were killed by another truck bombing in Beirut in September 1984. Terrorists hijacked an airliner, TWA 847, in July 1985 and killed one American, Navy diver Robert Stethem, whose corpse was thrown out of the plane and onto the runway. In October came the Achille Lauro incident, in which Palestinian terrorists commandeered a cruise ship and executed Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American tourist. In December, Abu Nidal terrorists attacked travelers simultaneously at airports in Rome and Vienna. In March 1986, terrorists killed four Americans in Greece. In April, Libyans bombed a West Berlin disco, killing two American soldiers and injuring dozens more. The Libyan attack finally elicited a military response from Reagan, who sent U.S. bombers to attack Tripoli and Benghazi. Commenting on the years of passivity preceding the Libya bombing, Reagan's biographer, Lou Cannon, observed, &quot;For five years of his presidency, Reagan talked tough about terrorism but did virtually nothing in the way of retaliatory action to stop it.&quot; <br />For a much better perspective on terrorism and 9/11, I recommend James Bamford's new book &quot;A pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies.&quot;	2004-06-23

Richard Clarke's book is a devastating critique of an administration, which is soft on real terrorism. <br />The points I took away from reading it. <br />Bush looks for \\"simple solutions,\\" a kind of bumper sticker president. Vice President Cheney (a draft dodger who was \\"too busy\\" to serve his country) is pictured as veritable war hawk who believed the U.S. should go it alone since \\"everyone else is just more trouble than they are worth.\\" Condoleezza Rice \\"looked skeptical\\" when Clarke briefed her in early 2001 about al-Qaida threats.  Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld wanted to bomb Iraq the day after 9-11 despite any evidence linking the nation to the attacks. And Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, during an April 2001 meeting with Clarke said \\"I just don't understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin Laden...You give bin Laden too much credit.\\"<br />Clearly, Clarke's book hit a nerve among the Conservative elite of the Bush Admin. and its many elite supporters in the media and think tanks. On the day the book was published, Dick Cheney appeared on fellow draft-dodger Rush Limbaugh's radio show to denounce Clarke. What was telling about his appearance was that its purpose was merely to issue a personal attack on Clarke as he did not bother to refute one point in the book. As is his wont, Karl Rove immediately sent out a talking points memo about Clarke's book to the elite members of the conservative media who promptly cut and paste Rove's talking points memo into their radio, TV, and print dispatches.<br />In all, this is an important book, which shows that the Bush Administration is not looking out for the best interests of the American people.

He illustrates how protectionist policies damage the economy and fail to save jobs. Examining U.S. trade policy, he shows how &quot;fair trade&quot; measures are arbitrary, unfair, and often harmful&quot;<br />Yet this author makes slight of America's long history of protectionist policies when it served its interest. In fact the history of America's industrial development was protecting her rising industries. So now that Americas industries are strong and known world wide; its labor force is a problem because it wants decent wages and health benefits.  What is the solution? Free trade! Or free trade in cheap labor and dealing with counties that have no labor unions, no regulations that get in the way of business and officials that are easy to bribe.<BR>This book is for those who have no critical facilities what so ever.	2004-03-04

This review is about the discursive and rhetorical strategies (perversity, futility, and jeopardy) O'Reilly uses in this book and radio shows. <BR>Mr. O'Reilly's books and radio shows are comforts to those who are confused in these troubling times. Yet - can Mr. O'Reilly be trusted in his words?<br />In his book, he writes about `trust' (who is looking out for you). In order to find out if I should `trust' O'Reilly, I need to listen to his radio show.<br />Any of his radio shows will demonstrate how `switched' his reasoning and rhetoric is. Since some people reason in different ways, it is best to see how this plays out.<br />Mr. O'Reilly likes using `common sense' judgements - i.e. \\"common sense tells us...\\"<BR>But what is `common sense' but what the majority and/or our rulers tell us is `true?'<BR>In other words, in appealing to `common sense' we have already formed a general concept of what it means to think. <BR>Now think this through. <BR>If this were so, by appealing to `common sense' blacks would still be slaves since at one time `commons sense' said certain people were not capable of reasoning and should be used as slaves.<br />Mr. O'Reilly also likes to make grandiose statements using qualifiers like `every,' `all,' and `none.' Listening to his radio show today he said `every law is under attack by secularists!' No if, and, or but - no qualifiers what so ever. <BR>This is his fact - `every law is under attack by secularists.'<BR>How could some one say that and be thought of as a semi-reasonable person?<br />Also, on the same program, he talked about marijuana and made some second-order judgements. <BR>In particular, he said: \\"marijuana is a gateway drug. This is a fact and I won't take any calls questioning this because this is the no spin zone!\\"<BR>Can I believe this statement?  I wanted to find out...<BR>I wanted to see if - as his book claims - he can be trusted.<BR>His claim that marijuana is a gateway drug, as far as I could tell, rests on his statement  - \\"all people who used heroin used marijuana.\\"<br />Anyway, I went to the library and checked out the latest book on marijuana research called \\"Understanding Marijuana: A new look at the scientific evidence,\\" Authored by Mitch Earlywine (Professor of Clinical Science and Director of Clinical Psychology, USC). Published by Oxford University Press (2002).<BR>Mr. Earlywine has a chapter (3) on `Gateway' (pages 49-65). <BR>In this chapter (which is worth reading in whole) Mr. Earlywine discusses David Hume, his writings on empirical reasoning, and how we should look at the evidence to see if marijuana is indeed a gateway drug - I quote \\"Hume's first criterion for establishing a cause concerns association. Despite popular stereotypes, the association between marijuana and harder drugs is not particularly strong' (page 53).<BR>Earlywine's conclusions appear on pages 63-64, in part he says, \\"There is no evidence that cannabis (marijuana) creates physiological changes that increase the desire for drugs. The idea that marijuana causes subsequent drug use also appears unfounded.\\"<br />In his book, Mr. O'Reilly makes many truth claims. In one instance, his claims about WMD in Iraq have appeared to be unfounded (so far). <BR>And his claim on his radio show - that marijuana is a gateway drug presented, as fact (no spin here) is also unfounded.<br />In all, Mr. O'Reilly operates using discursive and rhetorical strategies and tries to portray himself as a `common sense' guy just giving us the `truth.' <br />The problem is, for me; his `truth' and `common sense' are questionable.	2004-02-21

You were co-opted by the conservatives you so despised. What a fool!<br />Berman's arguments for war are based on discursive `facts' and hearsay. His arguments for a liberal regime in Iraq are also faulty. And his discussion of 'terrorism' fails to convince.<br />Right now, you are probably very disconcerted how things have turned out (no WMD) but your rationale (`but Sadam was a WMD.') is a weak case for a first strike.<br />Leave this book for the political science class of 2053 as they try to make `sense' of the Iraq War and how `rational' people could have supported such a lark.	2004-02-20

I can relate to you how Rush Limbaugh is a hypocrite for using drugs and evading the draft and since he claims to be a conservative, I can argue that all conservatives are using drugs and do not wish to serve the country.<br />In the end, Tammy Bruce is using her name and background as a way to make a substantial, yet dishonest, living.<br />Save you money and borrow the book from the library like I did.	2004-02-18

Their best-known victim, until now, was Sen. John McCain. He first drew Sampley's poisonous attention when, along with John Kerry, he debunked the idea that Americans were still being held by Vietnam, and endorsed the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Communist government. <br />Keating describes in detail how, in 1992, Sampley commenced a &quot;scurrilous&quot; crusade to punish McCain: <BR>&quot;Sampley ... accused McCain of being a weak-minded coward who had escaped death by collaborating with the enemy. Sampley claimed that McCain had first been compromised by the Vietnamese, then recruited by the Soviets. <BR>&quot;To those who know McCain and are familiar with his behavior in captivity, the charge is ludicrous. McCain resisted his captors to such a degree that he was isolated in a special prison for troublemakers. He repeatedly refused special favors, including early release, and emerged as a spiritual and religious leader for other prisoners. Nonetheless, Sampley was persistent enough in his claims that the press in McCain's home state of Arizona picked up on the KGB story.&quot; <BR>This book is an excellent reply to the venomous right such as Rush Limbaugh (who by the way avoided military service) who try to portray honorable Veterans like John McCain and John Kerry as less than honorable vets. McCain and Kerry served with honor. Limbaugh dodged the draft.	2004-02-11

Books	1	29	94	N	N	No, -- Please - give me a break Mr. Stossel!	In this book, Mr. Stossel gives us exceptions to the rule, anecdotal evidence, and cobbled up bits of statistical data to portray a society and bureaucracy gone amuck. <BR>In a way, I have to agree with him. After all, bureaucracies have to continually `war up' year after year to support their existence and they do this by presenting new `problems' to be `fixed.' Just look at the DEA and its `claims' about how `harmful' marijuana is. Yet if the same standards where applied to alcohol and tobacco, they too would be outlawed.<BR>One of books central claims is that the government should step aside and let the `free market' do the job. The only problem with that is that in many instances, the free market has ignored or failed to come up with a solution. In other cases it simply broke laws. <BR>Let's face it, if it wasn't for the government would we have roads, which subsidized the auto industry? And if it wasn't for the government would we have the Internet, which was a product of the government? In other words could we have expected the `free enterprise' system to build the roads and the Internet?  <br />Libertarians conveniently forget that it was the `government' that stole land from the native population so that individuals could be given the `legal' right to own the land which the government stole. Nice - eh? First steal something then make it against the `law,' then make it a foundation of you political philosophy.<br />And can we really trust the `free market' to be honest? Just look at the Saving and Loan scandal, the government deregulated the savings industry and that ended in a scandal that cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars. Look at the stock market bubble of the late 2oth century and the various scandals that came from that. <br />Mr. Stossel does a bad job of promoting the free market. In fact, by complaining about the so-called `liberal' media, Mr. Stossel argues against the free market since if the `liberal' media exists (and I think it only existsin his head) it would mean that there is a market for it. <br />In sum, Mr.Stossel is just another pampered, overbearing media star with a cushy job giving his audience what it wants - entertainment, no matter if the entertainment is bogus and error filled!	2004-02-08

Deeply flawed book.<br />I read this book in a poly-sci class. Its thesis is simple - by trying to help people, problems can be multiplied.<br />The author has lots of charts and graphs to prove his point. Yet some things did not click - for example in  Matusow's \\"The Unraveling of America\\", the author posits that the main beneficiary of LBJ's Great Society was the middle class - not the poor - so there appears to be a contradiction that Murray does not address.<br />One thing to keep in mind is that Murray appears to starts with a conclusion - welfare is bad because... - and constructs his argument from that instead of the other way around, which I find suspicious.<br />All his charts and graphs are meant to impress the reader but fall flat because he is neither an historian nor economist.<br /> Instead I would read \\"SOME TENDENCIES OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND THE PROBLEM OF INTERPRETATION\\" by Stephen T.

Norman Birnbaum is a first rate scholar and &quot;After Progress&quot; shows why.<br />The book is a an comparative history of policy reform in Europe and the United States from the late 19th century up the present day.<br />He illustrates that despite the rhetoric of &quot;no alternative&quot; to the so-called  `free market'  other ways do exist and work well  to help everyone and not just those who are `fortunate.'<br />The United States has only one chapter. In it, Birnbaum illustrates the workings of the New Deal, civil rights movements, the anti-war movement, and the right to clear air and water.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-27

This is a great book about a great President. In many ways I can identify with Pres. Bush. Like him I was born into wealth. Like him I was a mediocre student who 'partied' and was wild with the young ladies. It was only after numerous arrests for indescristions which my dad bailed me out was I able to find Jesus and the right path. Then my dad bought me a real estate business but that did not do well so his friends bought it from me for millions and then I bought another business. This time I bought some brains to run the business while I golfed with my frat boy friends. The business is thrifing thank to the numerous tax cuts intitiated by Pres. Bush. This is proof Team Bush is working for me!	2003-12-24

That problem with this book and Mr. Boortz's philosophy is that it has a weak foundation. From reading this book, I am uncertain what branch of libertarianism he belongs to but he believes, like most libertarians, in limited government (except of course to protect their property),  right of private property, and something called the free market.<br />Libertarians talk about these three ideas as a given, as if they always existed. The central component to all of this is private property and it is the foundation of their philosophy. But for American libertarians it is their Achilles heel. Since libertarians believe that the right to a given property is valid only when transferred legally without coercion one need only trace back said property to see if the property had been lawfully transferred (original acquisition). One need only trace various properties in the New England states to understand that most properties there had been stolen from the native population. If a property has been stolen, it has been obtained illegally. <BR>Instead of knocking down straw men, Mr. Boortz would do better in writing a book about defending basic libertarian values since this is a thin and weakly argued book that merely speaks to the converted. Those who a fans of Mr. Boortz should instead read Robert Nozick's &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; and come to understand that even he passes on the idea of `original acquisition' - that is how land was first acquired, since it is a sticky topic for most libertarians.	2003-09-23

I want to know if the news from Iraq or maybe the lack of news from Iraq about weapons of mass destruction has changed your opinion about anything. <br />Mr. POLLACK: Yes and no. Probably not as much as I think you'd suspect. At first, what you may remember from my book was I'd never thought that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the United States. <br />INSKEEP: That's right. <br />Mr. POLLACK: I felt that it was a much more distant threat. And the real threat that I felt from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program was the potential for Iraq to eventually develop nuclear weapons. Now I did believe that the Iraqis probably had some weaponized [chemical and biological] agents in the country, somewhere that they probably did have some ballistic missiles. <br />INSKEEP: U.S. officials did suggest that Iraqi military units were ready to use chemical or biological weapons, that chemical weapons had been distributed to front-line troops and that sort of thing. That does seem to have turned out not to be true at least. <br />Mr. POLLACK: Right, that's absolutely the case. And, you know, here's one where, you know, I think that, you know, my expectation was off base. <br />INSKEEP: On another point, which is the most crucial point to you, about nuclear weapons. You told us last November when you came on this program that you believed there was a consensus among American, British, French, German and Israeli intelligence that Saddam Hussein had everything he needed to develop nuclear weapons. I suppose some people would question now whether all of the components for a nuclear program could really be hidden that well, whether they could have disappeared. <br />Mr. POLLACK: Yeah, I mean, you're now getting beyond my area of expertise, Steven. I try very hard not to talk about things I don't know. I mean, the point that I made on your show was a true point. That was the consensus of opinion among the intelligence community. It was hearing things like that that brought me to the conclusion that, you know, 'Boy, if this is the case, we've got to do something about this guy.' I think, you know, that is exactly the kind of thing that we're going to need to go back and look hard at the evidence that we were getting and those various intelligence services who were making those claims, I think, are going to need to go back and re-examine the methods they used. As I said, that was not me making that claim; that was me parroting the claims of so-called experts. <br />All this is VERY troubling and I doubt if the public will ever know the truth.	2003-05-28

He equates 'elitism' with critical thinking and casts himself as a man  of the people, just listening to their opinions via his polls and town meetings. And yet he talks of his fancy jets and other staples of his lavish and selfish lifestyle.	2002-07-28

I borrowed this book from a friend in the ad business. It's pretty good in that it shows how 'they' try to influence 'our' buying decisions. Now when I shop, I think twice before I purchase something. Thanks!	2002-07-27

Any music book that includes articles about Young Marble Giants, Captain Beefheart, and The Cramps can't be all bad. <BR>But \\"The Secret History of Rock\\" could have been a better book. <BR>Let's start with the title - why include \\"Rock\\" in the title when the book includes musicians like Erik Satie, John Cage, Kraftwerk, King Tubby, and ESG. <BR>Next, the Introduction is poorly thought out and written. Sarig blames the \\"baby boomers who seemed to control the media with a form of cultural fascism, the radio programmers and entertainment marketers who were selling my generation the idea that the 60s had been the pinnacle of youth culture, that our own youth culture could never be as important or as exciting as it was back then.\\" Sarig, if you don't like the radio station you are listening to, change the dial. Better yet, don't listen to the radio. Everyone knows radio is lame, just listen to Elvis Costello's song \\"Radio, Radio,\\" and you'll understand why. The baby boomers have never forced me to listen to `classic rock.' Stop your whinnying. Also, Sarig doesn't get the irony of his rant that many of the musicians in the book are `baby boomers,' -  Wire, the Fall, Television, Jonathan Richman, boomers all. So don't blame a generation for not being more adventurous with your taste in music. I lived in Portland, Oregon in the early 80s, a small town with lots of `classic rock' fans. I never listened to the radio, I didn't blame the `media' for conspiring to make me listen to Led Zepplin and Sammy Hagar. I found LPs by the Fall, Wire, Young Marble Giants, and Fats Comet, sitting in my local independent music shop. <BR>In all, not a bad book, just could have been better with more thought and less whine.	2002-07-13

I recently bought this book after hearing that the author lost lots of money on Enron stock, the company that was the darling of the libertarian world.

Having been a youth in the 70s, I really enjoyed this book, since it brought me back to a time before eMpTV, and Spin. A time when you figured it out for yourself and not by some silly TV show and magazine telling you what was 'hep.' And a time before the merchandising of 'alternative' or 'grunge' by Sub Pop marketing folk. And hey, I have no tatooz or nose rings, and I like this music. That makes me really different...just kidding. Enjoy it and remember, Nurvana didn't invent punk rock.	2001-12-08

I learned a lot from this book. Mr. Gates, the inventor of the computer and the internet gives his thoughts about the future of business.

Microsoft will download their new OS onto our computer and bill us instantly. Great times ahead and I know everything Mr Gates does is in my best interest as a business and a consumer.	2001-11-30
