This book follows and enhances the characters from the previous book.  At first I thought I wasn't going to like it because Cassandra didn't trust Thomas.  I stuck around to see how that was worked out and fell in love with the book.  So, if you're like me and you like those characters built up as solid and stable right from the first, I encourage you to stick around to see how Kathleen Eagle works this out.  I can't wait for her next book to get published, so Mrs. Eagle, if you're reading these reviews, hurry up!!  While cruising Amazon for books, I did stumble upon Lakota Legacies, which has a short book by Kathleen Eagle.  I'm barely into it, but I can already tell it's going to be great!  You're safe with this author.	2004-01-26

I haven't followed the series - I buy Linda Winstead Jones.  This book was awesome!  This author can always be counted on to create the best characters, the best storylines, and the steamiest love scenes combined to make her, in my opinion, the best author on the market.  I hope she writes faster because when I'm out of her books, I'm having to settle for second rate reading while waiting for her next one to come on the market.  The storyline of this series is similar to the old movie Twins... far fetched.  That's OK, though, because she brings it together and makes it work.  Keep them coming, Linda!!	2004-01-26

I know you know, but NO ONE builds the characters like you do... so close you feel you know them as your personal friends.  This book is the reason I have 31 of yours.  You have an amazing talent!  The way you characterized Reese is what fed the addiction.  I wanted to hate Helen, but, as in real life, without the struggles, the love would be taken for granted.  I have loved all your books, but this one is #1 - tied with The Night Remembers!  Aren't you writing a sequel to The Night Remembers!??  I want to make sure I've got it on pre-order!

This one is easy to put down, easy to forget, and totally unemotional.  Go ahead and skip to the last page for the one touch of emotion. If she wants to wait until the end to put Camille and Creed together, go for it, but she should have covered romance with James and Jordan, don't just skip the emotion a good book should possess. The story line (front and back covers of the hard book) reminded me of Bygones by Lyverle Spencer. Kathleen Eagle should read that book and then rewrite hers. Spencer covers emotions not just wedding plans. Very forgettable. Kathleen Eagle needs to go back to her original writing style. Fire and Rain, The Last True Cowboy, What the Heart Knows. Real emotion.	2002-07-15

It covers a journey through true love that includes betrayal. Most of us have too much pride to survive it. Even though the circumstances are never justified, love saw them through it. The deep issues of this book really do almost justify the betrayal. So the question becomes, &quot;Is it better to love him but never let him know I still love him for fear he'll hurt me again, or to risk the hurt and not deny the once-in-a-lifetime love?&quot;  Ms. Eagle covers life's issues - always in her books. This is a beautiful book that touches the heart and remains there. It's a huge switch for her.  Typically, Ms. Eagle's characters are loyal to the core. This one was a shock, but a tremendous read! Ms. Eagle's latest book comes out this month (Jully 2002) and I've had it on pre-order since April. You'll lose lots of sleep reading her books! She has proven to be timeless!	2002-07-06

When I read a romance novel, I enjoy the author building strong characters that both are likeable and easy to &quot;fall for&quot; so to speak.  In other words, you're wishing the best for both.  The conflict is there, of course, or the reading would be too boring.  The author builds on those feelings the hero and heroine have for each other and keeps those bonds strong enough with both parties that you know that even though the conflict may be there, the love is never in question. This book accomplished that for me.  In the end, when the couple gets back together, it makes you feel good because you like both characters.  This was a cleverly written great read.  I am a fan of Arlene James and I'll continue to read her.	2002-05-30

I didn't like the cheerleader scene, but it was such a minute part of the book, I could easily overlook it.  I would have ended the book after firing Caroline, with Jesse going back to her shabby apartment and groveling for him to take her back.

It's OK to limit it to sexless, but all other romance books I've read allowed me to endear myself to the hero.
