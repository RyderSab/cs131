I grew up near where he did, though not quite as poor, and he got it right. I cried all the way through the book, partly with pity for him and partly because I wished I had written it. I don't remember any bad grammar, just that he captured the way people used to talk in that area (before everybody started watching TV 24/7 so that most people in the US have lost most of their charming regional dialects) <br />I spent my childhood in an old house heated with wood stoves, and we like to froze to death in the winter.	2005-06-04

It is the very best book to read aloud. It gets gasps, smiles and laughs from every group. Best of all, I never get tired of reading it. I gave it to an art teacher who used it for a project. Ask students to draw a picture of their Plumbean house and to write an explanation of it.	2005-06-04

I shared it with a young kindergarten teacher I know; she had never heard of Ferdinand or some of the other older books.  <br />Obviously, this is not the one essential book to take to your desert island, but I find it useful as a parent/teacher/librarian to go along with my Jim Trelease books, Esme Codell's How to Get Your Child to Love Reading, and other resources.	2005-05-26

This one is different. <BR>Not that I have the most exalted taste, but I was an English major and now am a librarian, so I have read a few books...This is a winner. <BR>Anyone age 10 and up can read it and love it.

Yeah, I do have computerized catalog, but the library here is still a teacher break, in the good ole 'art-music-PE-library' rotation. The kids go to music and get taught music, they come to me and get taught library. This does not make sense, but hey, it pays the bills. This book has some good lessons on the Dewey Decimal System, using the encycolpedia, etc. that work for me, and would even work if you have a school library that does meaningful stuff.	2003-09-07

It is heartbreaking and makes you take action. First thing Monday morning, I'm going to deliver a load of food to the local food bank and ask about volunteering there. It is frustrating to realize that I cannot do too much to solve the overall problem, thinking that it is better to teach someone to fish than to give them a fish.The stories in the book are also frustrating because there are a lot of unanswered questions. The middle-class woman whose doctor husband left her- why couldn't she rent out part of the house and get some money? And then rent another room at a reduced rate to a student, with partial exchange for child care. Then she can work or go to school. I was also intrigued by the army man whose children are starving. Meanwhile, he is smoking cigarettes. (They are expensive!)	2003-02-01

Yes, some of the advice is common sense, but from what I see of the epidemic of divorce, not many people have common sense! If you do not understand these concepts, you will not have a good marriage. <BR>One annoying thing about the book, though, is that there was apparently very little editing done. Of course, this is common in books these days. No one knows, or cares, how to proof or edit. &quot;when I compare Nan and I to just about every couple I know&quot;.  Ever hear of subject and object? This usage is throughout the book.  At one point, there is a reference to a &quot;crumbled&quot; grocery list.  Hey, cookies crumble, paper crumples.  To anyone who has a degree of basic literacy, these things are a constant annoyance.	2002-10-01

There are books about Johnny Appleseed, Thanksgiving, Martin Luther King, Chinese New Year, George Washington, St. Patrick's Day, etc. Several of these relate directly  to the state of Virginia standards of learning.  Most of the mini-books are  good, with repetitive, easy to read text.  In the St. Patrick's day book, a  leprechaun asks various animals, &quot;Have you seen my pot of gold?&quot;  They reply, &quot;Go ask the pig&quot;  &quot;Go ask the horse&quot; etc. A  few of the stories seem to be there because the author ran out of good  ideas after about 21 or so, but there are enough good ones to make it well  worth the price.  Some of our students have no books at home, so it is nice  for them to have something to take home to keep.	2000-03-30
