US	49822439	R2BOK6T8PRMQZ1	0312981384	34907413	Endless Night	Books	3	15	20	N	N	Very clever plot!	The \\"Endless Night\\" is a fine novel written outside the famous Poirot series. Agatha Christie did a marvelous job on the setting and the main theme of the novel. The novel is a two-prong approach to a mystery/thriller and a mystery/horror. The reader remains wondering and awaiting for the murder and in the process attempts many guesses. However interesting is the setting, end is that much disappointing. I say this because as the reader ventures towards the end, the conclusion becomes obvious. But then again it is the case with majority of the novels by Agatha. I, therefore, believe that her novels should be read for variety of interesting ideas and past time reading rather than a nutcracker mystery. I am a fan of Agatha, especially when it comes to early 20th century settings and the adventures Poirot.	2005-04-22

I have the honor of studying law under Professor Robert Hardaway. Prof. Hardaway is a Civil Procedure and Evidence professor at the Strum College of Law, University of Denver, Colorado. Prof. Hardaway made my first year law school experience worth remembering, and only after his class I truly enjoyed the movie, \\"Paper Chase.\\" <br /> <br />The novel remarkably encapsulates the facts for a nonprofessional and a legal scholar alike. Prof. Hardaway's writing style is flawless and attracts the readers, as was his effusive and exciting lectures. The title of the book \\"Alienation of Affection\\" is a legal clich that is extinct in all the states in the U.S., except South Carolina. Alienation of Affection is a term for a legal action by an estranged husband or a wife against the person responsible for the estrangement. In most cases, such person is a lover for whom a husband or a wife, for that matter, leaves his or her counterpart.  <br /> <br />I think the reader will thoroughly enjoy this book and will learn immensely on the history of Denver, and lifestyles of the early 20th century. Especially of those commoners like Ms. Gertrude who became the rich and famous.  <br /> <br />PS: Nobody gets hit over the head by a baseball bat in this novel.  <br />	2005-04-17

I say this because the setting and the plot seems to be extremely difficult in nature. The novel offers lot of facts yet it clings on to your attention. Novel explores and indulges into Chinese cultural puzzles, which were significantly hard to grasp. I was confused to categorize the nature of the novel. The novel is a pendulum between a thriller and a historical narrative on Chinese political thought. <br /> <br />The historical public administrative analysis offered in the novel fascinated me. I was surprised to know how advance and well-organized Chinese bureaucracy was centuries ago. Emperor's orders and communication reached the local municipalities in the far most corners of China with flawless accuracy.   <br /> <br />In all fairness, I liked the novel with some reservations. On one hand, I enjoy reading obscure subject matters yet on the other hand at times the novel felt like a heave. I would only recommend this novel to some one who is ardently interested on Chinese culture or history.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-14

In my opinion this is the best book written on the life of Genghis Khan. There is a variety of reasons for this assessment. First and the far most important reason is the ease of reading in Weatherford's style. He has kept details succinct and facts precise and relevant to the events at issue. The book is a testament of Weatherford's extensive research and grasp over Mongolian `Secret History.' I recommend this book to all the readers indiscriminative of their previous knowledge on Genghis Khan. The book is not simply a historical reference, but also an analytical study in to the mind of Genghis Khan, and the strategies he employed in enhancing his campaigns, economy and diplomacy. I was quite impressed with Genghis Khan's approach on the legal system he developed for the conquered tribes and nations. In many aspects this illiterate Khan was applying the legal theories that were yet to be debated in the rest of the world. Religion and legal autonomy of local states was surprising. Genghis Khan left religion to the individuals and encouraged the legislation of local laws so long as they are not in conflict with the Supreme Mongol law, a concept American constitutional law scholars and judiciary confronted more than six hundred years later!	2004-04-21

I think this book was probably the best work of Dostoevsky. In my personal view I believe that the beginning was much better then the end. The character of Roskolnikov was developed as an angry young man who sees world through morbidly vexed eyes. The ending was a bit disappointing since the character of Roskolnikov was stripped down from an angry young man to a creature that is morally and emotionally destroyed. Dostoevsky perhaps knew better what he intended to accomplish from this book, but in my humble opinion the book should have ended without capitulating Roskolnikov to a standards of the so called `civilization.' But then Roskolnikov does mean the one who confesses.....	2002-08-10

Mr. Buchanan remarkably outlines the critical yet historical elements of the American foreign policy. Not only the analysis are brilliant but they are also very reader friendly. He discusses the historical American support for the Israel, NATO and the Baltic, and the price of this support. After reading this book I became aware of the some of the most complex US-Israeli relations such as US disappointment over the technology transfer when Israel sold Patriot and Python missile, and F-16 among other spy planes technology to China. In addition, Mr. Buchanan illustrates how `sick man of the Europe' (Russia) will get better and inevitably confront the US led NATO expansion into the Eastern Europe. And when such time comes and Russia tries re-strengthen its buffer zone by placing its army in the Baltic, will it be worth loosing American soldiers over countries such as Poland, Latvia etc. since under NATO article V, attack on one is attack on all. One thing Mr. Buchanan stresses over and over again is the cost benefit analysis for the support of the `so-called' American vital interests for which America will go to war. And while he is stressing and outlines these issues he articulately ask the reader are these interests (e.g. NATO, Poland, Baltic and Israel) really America's vital interests? <BR>I think this book a very good read. It catches reader's attention from the very beginning. I strongly recommend this book to all who are interested in this sort of reading. It is a must read.	2002-04-06

It has many flaws but no unique quality. I would like to address these flaws as following:<br />1. The book uses quotations but hardly uses reference to cite those quotations. Since Mr. Muir was not present at the time of the Prophet- he should have cited the source for his information.<br />2. The very fact Mr. Muir was not Muslim; he could not grasp the ideology of Islam. He depicts the decisions of the Prophet as of some common leader who would usurp his power. He does not just stop at this in fact he uses the twist of the English language to magnify his distortions of the facts by adding dramatic adverbs. To make things interesting for his audience (for the record I exclude myself from such) he describes the scenarios as if he was there. This eliminates the sense of legitimacy of the work.<br />3. Finally, Mr. Muir does not seem to have command over neither the Quran nor the Hadith (the sayings of the Prophet), which hinders his capacity to justifiably comment on the early Islamic times.<br />Over and over again I become utterly surprised when I see works on the Islamic history written by western historians who not only repeat but also invent the information. There are but a few authentic sources left intact on the Islamic history, and the student of Islamic history should use those to investigate. The rest of the works by authors such as Muir, Glubb, Madelung and Margoliouth should be only used as supplementary sources and for the purposes of critique or case studies.<br />I recommend to the students of the Islamic history to read the original sources such as the works of Ibn Ishaq (Life of Muhammad), Ibn Sa'ad (Tibaqat ibn Sa'ad), Ibn Khaldun (Tariek Ibn Khaldun), Al Tabari (History of the Prophets), Al Waqqidi (Kitab al Maghazi), Al Masoodi, Ibn Kasier, Al Sayuti (The Khalifaa who took the Right Path), Ibn Khalqqan, Al Bladhuri (The Origins of the Islamic State) and last but not least the four major works of Traditions or the sayings of the Prophet: Sahieh Bukhari, Ibn Maja, Muslim and Abu Daowed.<br />In terms of the works of the western scholars I recommend works of M. Watt, S. Humph ryes, W. Irving and M. Lings. These scholars have truly studied the original sources and understood the concepts of Islam. They don't tend to repeat the information. They are inquisitive and very useful in the sense that they specialize in certain areas within the Islamic History. For example, if one is interested in the constitution of Medina he or she should follow S. Humphrey's works where as if one wants to investigate the administration of the Prophet he should follow M. Watt's works.<br />I wish the reader best of luck and I hope this review has been helpful.the four major works of Traditions or the sayings of the Prophet: Sahieh Bukhari, Ibn Maja, Muslim and Abu Daowed.<br />In terms of the works of the western scholars I recommend works of M.

Islam is the fastest growing religion and there are certain fundamentalist movements in different countries as authors explain. However, after careful analysis I came to conclusion that the situation is blown out of proportion. There is not such things or idea as Islamic Threat. Islam believes in peace and tranquility of all. Unlike Pax Romana, Pax Islamica clearly dictates the tolerance for coexistence for different religion.

It has captured the decaying society of the selective rich and their attaches quite well. However, I believe it portrays the class which in neither open nor acquiescent to a common  Pakistani. The reader should bare in mind that Hamid's attempt is enlighten  the Pakistani-Americans and Pakistanis who have not yet been exposed to  Pakistani mile high club, to the rotting of ideological beliefs, weakening  of moral standards among the newly rich (no-doulatiya) and a further  decrease in the welfare of proletariat and sub-proletariat in Pakistan.	2000-05-27

I recommend this book especially for a westerner who has not read anything on Islamic origin. Although this  book by no means is an authority on Islamic history, it does give a good  brief snap shot of events. I would abet the non-Muslims to read this book  to understand the Islamic beliefs even though they might not agree with  them.	2000-05-27
