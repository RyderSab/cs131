Over the years since this, and many other stories by Barks, have appeared, they have come in many formats, of which the best is the COLLECTED  WORKS OF CARL BARKS, and now this series, including this title, comes in a nicely done cover, with Library  quality paper. I have copies of this in a previous  incarnation of the GLADSTONE  prints, prior to the Publishers going bust. Thankfully, someone has realised that these titles are being bought by Adults who could not afford the collected works, but who wanted a title done in a collectable  format that would last. Way too many versions of this title published since the late 50's and again in the 70s have been done on poor quality paper, and were  priced  accordingly.  This Ancient Persia  title works  well in this comic format, however, some of the titles  occurred originally in a strip format, and suffer when transferred  to the comic page format. However, I managed to get some of these titles in a \\"hard\\" cover binding that preserved the strip ratio, without resorting to the comic page ratio that was edited with apparently  little  thought ( these editions in original strip format came out about 1982-84, and as far as I am aware are not currently available anywhere... so I hope someone can examine some of the original  formats, and see what best goes back to the strip format).    Enjoy ANCIENT PERSIA, if you read the original story years ago, this will  echo beautifully in your mind in this lovely high quality paper print edition.	2005-10-11

This will be the fourth or Fifth book involving Harry, and provides the usual masterful mix of Magic, Supernatural Terror, Sex and Ultra  Violence.  Unusually this  paperbook  edition has come out first in the US, and I wonder if it has been published elsewhere first? Anyways, I look forward to the  HardBack  publication so I can  have a long  lasting edition of this  superb frightfest.  It is very clear that the already superb narrative  skills of Masterton have been honed through years of  writing, and the payoff is a good hero being presented in an even better manner. Luckily for any horror  fans not familiar with the Divine  Erskine, the backstory bits  relevant to this narrative are given, and hopefully  you will enjoy this  work, and go back to read MANITOU, the  REVENGE OF THE MANITOU, DJINN, BURIAL, and all after reading this master-work.    I am very happy to write that as at October 2005, Masterton has a vast number of works out, and all after a period of almost nothing being available in print. Hopefully the success of these new books will resonate, and such classics as PARIAH will also be re-printed; the Inside cover mentions such other  Masterton gems as TENGU,CHARNEL HOUSE, and THE CHOSEN CHILD, all of which will repay readings, and re-readings. Masterton's  first person narrative creates such vivid worlds that in my opinion, they should ALL  be made into films, and the world of Horror films would be so much the richer.  As usual MANITOU BLOOD  contains a lush collection of well researched  material that will please the supernatural  horror fiend.    ENJOY... I recommend  my favorite Horror  author  with great gusto... you will not be disappointed as he scares, tantalises, titillates, and scares the wits out of you.	2005-10-10
US	52649318	R2UOJC0XLJJIGH	B0008EH6KA	937109510	The Price of Loyalty : George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Win at Any Price ....[ From the Paperback edition ]	As has been noted by some reviewers, this is not a book by Paul O'Neill, nor is it primarily about O'Neill. <br />The key to what is being depicted is a narrative of what happened in one man's tenure in a system that has all but totally  failed, and how \\"informed consent\\" (p.348) is an issue worth fighting for in this world. <br />The narrative is tight, and well written, but takes a little work to get into. <br />The Issues that are immediately at hand are all key points. \\"Loyalty\\" in O'Neill's view is intrinsically  tied to inquiry. But \\"Loyalty\\" in this organisation is more akin to Fealty. Deception is very much par for the course in this narrative: the push to unseat Saddam is an already done deal at the start of the Administration, and the question is not about the \\"WHYS\\" but is far more pragmatic ... how to wilfully deceive the public so that the goal can be achieved. <br />The extent to which events, discussions, and policy is all stage managed is frightening. <br />Paul O'Neill, the player in the narrative, is a truth \\"seeker\\" and truth \\"teller\\" in the view of the book. Yet the inside look of the administration suggests that truth is/was the first casualty. The infamous quote about the President on p.149 is a superb paradigm for what we see happening almost every other day in the administration. Someone like Paul O'Neill is a practical person, where the questions such as \\" what do I think and why do I think it\\"( p.292) are apparently luxuries where the process and method are all about the cut-throat thrust and parry of the conservatives. And  make no mistake, Paul O'Neill is most definitely a Conservative. What is very scarey is just what hold the idealogues have on the political world; and politics is defined as \\"winning\\" by any means, not by truth telling. <br />The people in \\"charge\\" are about setting forth pre-conceived ideas that are not subject to analysis at any stage. Questioning by any member of the administration is painted as \\"unpatriotic\\" in theBooks  depiction of the events. <br /> <br />The very handy nature of this book is that it can easily serve as a primer about the paradigm of this  Administration... and as has been said, those who live by the sword shall die  by the sword; we can take the conceptual model here and better understand the events we see unfolding in the last months/years of the administration, and know that these events are built like a house of cards with no basis in truth of any sort. Even when such things as the ignoring of the 12th amendment, or should I say the \\"bending\\" of the terms of the 12th  amendment as it applies to Cheny show that winning is the one and only goal, the people be damned. History will judge this Administration, but in the mean time, we have at least a few books that tell a consistently horrific story of deception, lies, stupidity, and heartlessness that tears away at the very fabric of so many communities. These people will have a lot to answer for when judgement comes.	2005-10-05

An essay by any standard	Responses to this book have been so varied, that it is surprising. The most bizarre riposte to this work is from those who call Mike Scheur a liberal, and if you read the book he is not. <br />I give this book 5 stars simply because it has been eerily prescient over events in the regions it has covered. The presumption seems to be that \\"Anonymous\\" wanted to start a debate. With a book that on one level has cover to cover details, it is a surprise to find that in a very self-deprecating review of his own work, Mr Scheur states that he has failed to ignite a serious discussion on what he obviously considers to be an important topic.  In the same  review, in an uncharacteristic show of succinct writing, and clear summing up, he gives the three points the book is giving forth, and he also says that the failure may in part be due to the lack of clarity in his writing. Mike Scheur's review of his own book is, I hope, an indication that he is aiming to be clearer, or aiming to get better editors. <br />To take this book apart chapter by chapter would basically be pointless. The book has, in public forums, been seized on by idealogues of the left and right. Once the idealogues get the scent, they pick a point or two out of the book, even if these points have come from third parties, and then slam the book based on the third parties \\"analysis\\". The nature of polemics in these circumstances is \\"don't confuse me with facts... I have already  made my mind up...\\". So, the source for some reviews gives a skewed  perspective, since it is one idealogues view set in a Polemical style, which is then rehashed when the reviewer, who as some other reviewers have stated, have obviously not read the book, presents a variant on a theme  from a third party source, usually  uncredited. <br />The difficulty in looking at this book, is that any one chapter could easily be expended out to a book in and of itself. However, Schuer has said in his review of his own work that there is only 3 points. Even Richard Clarke has reviewed this book, and said that it is detailed, and one \\"hopes\\" it is not true . <br />I suspect that the  administration has read this book, but I doubt that many opinion makers have read this book in any fair sense, since the general reviews of this work have been so distorted; personally I hope Mike Scheur continues to write and at least attempts to provoke thought, if not debate, on an issue that is defining a very shaky period of time in history. The one thing that is needed is action on any analysis, but most importantly it needs to be thoughtful action rather than action which has previously been governed by idealogues. I am currently reading the paperback of THE PRICE OF LOYALTY, and it is scarey how many similarities to Schuer's, Clarke's and others work exist.	2005-09-15
US	52649318	R2PUCM89RB9421	0843946334	614948685	Prey	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Other Worldly and Superb	Masterton's Work has never been for all people. He has a style that brings the other world into reaching distance of this world. He creates works that lovers of the surreal side of horror enjoy. In many respects that is what his horror novels have in common, since none of them are consistently in touch with the other side unless with-in the bounds of the people he studied in character.<br />  As usual, Masterton creates a vivid first person narrative, and shows the person a picture of a dark and foreboding place in the other side of the world of \\"reality\\". I have never been disappointed by a Masterton Horror novel, and whilst I also wonder why he has not received more wider acclaim than he has, it is very evident that he has influenced the film world of horror either implicitly, or explicitly. I sometimes suspect maybe that he has done a script under a Nom De Plume, especially  since Masterton's Books have appeared under the names of \\"other authors\\".<br />PREY is a rather vivid example of Masterton's many books that I have seen all too many times. He can paint a brilliant picture of a lush, beautiful island, as well as the house in the book, and then push us \\" through the looking glass\\" to the other side, and in many ways, have the other side come slithering into our world. Very few writers create the kind of atmosphere that Masterton can, and yet, when he does , the \\"elite\\" horror fans continue to pan his work in the worst  possible way.<br /><br />Overall, with Masterton's works, I would much prefer to buy hardback copies of Masterton's material, and on occasion I have, but they  are mostly in the rather short lived \\"trade paperbacks\\" which have enough acid to cause them to give the book the PH level of a Kitty Litter tray.	2005-08-29

A Surveyor working in France, finds a tank with an entity who is a member of a class of demon supposedly used in world war 2. The Demon coerces the surveyor/cartographer into helping it escape and joins its other associates, and a whole barrage of supernatural events ensue, with the demon tidying up after each little event. First class writing, and would have made a great film. Such a pity that people still just rip off Masterton's work ( unless he options rights on the qt); anyway, this is a great read, and will make you keep the light on Loooong after you finish.

Didactic/Polemic [?]...  Humour pervades this book. At the very least, it can be said to be a good read for those with a sense of humour. However, some do not take Moore's work as humour, mainly for partisan  reasons.  A scarey point is , and Moore notes this in an additional section done after the Hard Back was out. His jokes about downsizing everyone and using prisoners  as the labour force have been in fact put into action, in fact its a major trend in the penal system. As Moore also notes, the prison system itself may be taken offshore if the plans to build a prison or prisons in Mexico is actually  allowed to happen; even Moore calls this craziness.  The factual sections of the book have been well researched, and I am sure Moore could substantiate all of the claims made, if you look into the credits for the book, Moore' University research  assistants in this book ( seems to be a trend if you look into Franken's  \\"Team Franken\\"  researchers).  Moore gives plenty of guidelines to things such as  the \\"Etiquette\\" of downsizing. And even tests the ethical nature of some groups by forming some legitimate, but far-fetched named groups ( Satan  worshippers  for Dole, as one example), making donations by legitimate cheques, and seeing who cashes  the cheques. Whatever can be said about Moore's ideas, he sure can come up with some unforgettable concepts for actions.  He touches on many , very many, ideas that have been held by many, including the destruction of the American Dream.  The Satirical  points he makes, such as pointing out that the Republicans and Democrats are not significantly  different( so  much so that he labels them the \\"Republicrats\\") all make some sort of perverse  sense.  The Chapter listing pretty much  covers the areas he covers, except that is more fun to read the contents. New ways to pick a president provides for some chuckles, but seems a little too third worldly... even though he claims that parts of the US  could qualify for  third world status.    An amazing book. No doubt very villified by the conservatives, but if Ann Coulter can get away with her extreme articles, then Mike's extended  series of \\"Op-Ed\\"  Chapters can be accepted on that ground alone.	2005-04-27

The most surreal aspect of this book is that it would make a great horror genre read with a little bit of a rewrite.  As for the Theology... Mmmm, not exactly standard, but very much of the charismatic/pentecostal style of \\"thought\\".    Anyway, academically speaking, this is what falls under the \\"Mystical experience\\" type of argument. The only person it has validity for in a logical  sense is the person who experienced it. Oddly enough, Mormon theology would accept this kind of revelation, but it would still only have specific  relevance for her.    Either this Author is a wannabe Horror author, or she has some serious mental health issues. But its an amazingly fun read, and I hope someone options the Movie rights ... wow, what a scare this would make... better than CONSTANTINE  even.	2005-04-26

In many respects though, we still have a long way to go. Progress will not be made unless the surgeons who treat the sufferers of this disorder/disease are made to understand what is happening. It is a very real issue, and there are some rehab  staff  who see it all too often, but the high paid Doctors do not acknowledge this issue. <br />An excellent accompanying book for this one is  CRY OF THE DAMAGED MAN... and it is a traumatic book, but it shows how one surgeon came to realise what his patients  were  going through. <br />I have had people I know and care for treated look psychos by the establishment  Doctors. <br />One of the worst places to have this range of problems is in Australia, particularly Victoria, Australia, and Tasmania  , Australia. <br />A  relative of mine in Tasmania had a horrible  accident that left him with life long pain, which the Doctors and his immediate family all said were  psychological. He suffered for a lifetime, and eventually killed himself to stop the pain. A couple of family  members knew what he was going through and believed him. They helped him immensely, but the Doctors he was treated by were educated during the period of B F  Skinner, and such a horrible legacy that man Left that it warped several  generations. Including the perpetrator of some vicious  books, Ainslie Mears... a Doctor  very  affected by B F  Skinner. <br />In Victoria, the TAC sentences people  with the problems described in this book to a lifetime of pain. The Victoria, Australia government  body is all about money; there is no humanity in it. In one case a friend came to the United States for diagnosis and a treatment  regime, and upon returning to the Vicious Victoria, the Doctors  were livid  with rage that she had gone to a place that understood  her problem; she had dared to question their \\"God\\" like authority. <br /> <br />For those of you reading this who do not have the problems covered by the rubric of Chronic Pain, or the so called Invisible  Chronic Pain, you need to learn; some people you know may be going through  this, and whilst you cannot truly understand the pain, the words to say that mean the most are, I'll be there for you. <br />Gradually these pain problems are being truly documented  thanks to major advances in technology. The Doctors who have denied the existence of this problem have a lot to answer for, and in some cases have blood on their hands. <br /> <br />This is truly a breakthrough book. <br />There are ways and means available now that can help manage these pain problems. Eventually there will be treatments. If you know someone who is going through the problems discussed in this book, a gift of this book may very well be a life saver. <br /> <br />This book made a difference for me, as has the various other books in this area; also, Emmett Millers  work has been of vital  importance.	2005-04-18

The one thing that is evidenced in the credits is just how well  connected the  author of this very readable biography seems to be. This makes for one hell of a great read.  The dividing up of the book into sections that cover such and  such a section of Curie's life, and other events seems spurious, and is basically the opinion of a reviewer. What is clear is that the author uses synchronic and diachronic methods through many chapters, whilst following a fairly  sequential  narrative. But structurally, the book uses  sequential ( diachronic), and summary ( synchronic) styles to illustrate the various themes of the chapters.  Access  to the private documents written by Curie and others shows just how Marie Curie was in many moments, when previously people had thought other things about Curie. Marie Curie, broke through incredible hardships, gender prejudice, and other cultural  bias to forge a position in the pantheon of the science greats. This book is about the inner life, and the great internal struggle that she went through for her to survive and thrive. And by doing so, Marie Curie contributed  greatly by example to her children, and through her children, to the life of France, and also of the world.  The cascading effect her brilliant work facilitated made for some of the greatest, and ( arguably) some of the most horrendous scientific principles of the last century... I use \\"horrendous\\" carefully, since, the guiding principles that move Marie Curie were ones of help for the good of humankind; fission has clearly had some very negative effects in the world.  All of this is clearly known, but the inner side of Marie Curie's life is given careful exposition, side by side with the already publicly  available material... including Marie Curie's clear belief in Spiritualism.  This is a first rate work, very readable , enjoyable, and will undoubtedly be a part of the history of science in a later book in some way, shape or form, given its carefully crafted  insights to a great scientist, a troubled individual, and also someone who loved their work to such an extent that the child like, lack of skepticism, left them in awe of the beauty of science and the natural world. A truly visionary person, who persisted, and gave the world a gift of craft, vision and significant legacy.    My only criticism is minor: End-notes, I hate them.Copious end-notes can usually hide a lot of sneaky things in some less than intellectually honest people ( Ann Coulter as one example), but for me, I just prefer  footnotes, which may be just my bias, but thats me.    Anyways:    ENJOY	2005-04-13

In some respects, the work here has been surpassed by other references, but it has never been out-classed. In a rather perverse way, the Process of looking up a Sanskrit word gets easier as you know the word you are looking for in the book. This is hard to articulate given the nature of the Sanskrit  language, so in a real sense , you need a range of other books as well as this dictionary; these would include, a Verbal Root book, a Classical grammer[sp?], as well as a Mediaeval grammer, since many popular texts come from the so-called mediaeval period... viz., the PURANAS.  So, in this respect it is a circular method that really necessitates a learning by rote method, until you can participate in that circle.  So, with Singular, Dual, and plural forms in either Parasmaipada, or Atmanepada, you have your work cut out for you, especially with 8 cases  in most words.

I thoroughly enjoyed Masterton's usual first person narrative, and the way he spreads out a mythos in a way only  he can.  Masterton has a history of doing material that is excruciatingly painful in its detail ... I mean that he depicts some horrific acts very well, but always in context, and never in a gratuitous manner( see TENGU as one example of some very extreme  work). But his thematic work in this genre is brilliant. If someone could option these stories and do a film based on even some of Masterton's material, we would have some great and scarey  films.  Masterton has covered such a wide range of genres, and so many books, that he is bound to have a few \\"lesser\\" books, but this is all relative, since a lesser book in the Graham Masterton world of stories is always far superior to the dross of some \\"popular\\"  writers, and Masterton always provides value for money.

And he certainly seems to need it in DEVILS OF D DAY. I think that the mix of the supernatural, violence, sex, and the humour in the characters that Graham Masterton delivers for us is more human than some people like, but it is still fiction and the element that people need to realize is that  a suspension of disbelief is necessary for the mix to work. I totally love what Graham does in the books he has created. I first read CHARNEL HOUSE in about 1977 and i went back  to MANITOU and then to REVENGE OF THE MANITOU and I have been given the best times in reading thanks to his work. Comparing DEVILS OF D DAY with GARDEN OF EVIL, the skill in character work is great, and I enjoy what he does. He gets better as he continues, and he never fails to make me a happy reader, even in the supposedly childrens book HOUSE OF BONES.  I have been lucky enough to get signed copies of his work and so far, one copy of a work signed to me directly, and I was over the moon about that; he is a great writer in my view, and he is very giving of his time, and his audio books are worth buying ( all I wish I had with the audio books is that they came in CD sets rather than downloads, which is not my favorite, however, since I like them, I will take them as I  can get them ).<br /><br />A Great read for Harry Eskine fans, and a great trip into the supernatural as we see Masterton just get better with another smash horror book that should have been made into a movie. If only  someone in Hollywood  would discover these  brilliant  stories !!!	2005-03-29

Then after a car accident, I re-discovered it. And that was the best result. I had to learn how to manage Chronic pain. Miller's tape is absolutely mesmerising at points, and totally enthralling at others. It avoids the pitfalls of the subliminal tapes that have emerged which claim to have \\"special tones\\" and all sorts of other things.  I have 3 or 4 other tapes by Miller, and all are excellent, but it seems to me that the essence of all the tapes come from this classic work.  Having used this tape since late 1991 intensively, and extensively, I can highly  recommend it. The only unfortunate things is that to my knowledge it is not available on CD.   [ As of  September 2005, I discovered that This item is available in CD... if you can get this gem in CD, then do so.]    The tape is totally worth its weight in gold, and hopefully a CD  copy will be eventually  released, and maybe even contain some expanded material. I honestly cannot recommend this tape highly enough, especially if you have a need for a helpful guide to rest, or to focus your energies wether it be because of health issues, stress, or whatever; this tape is the best I have ever heard in this genre. Miller takes you through a restful journey that is spiritual, without dwelling on some of the inane  silliness that a few of these type of tapes indulge in... Miller is realistic, and yet totally other-worldly at the same time. For all people, of any faith, or none, this tape is a brilliant work.	2005-03-24

But after seeing the film, this book adds an element of exposition that gives a veneer of understanding to the film. Whilst neither this extremely readable book, nor the film, are what may be called \\"Art\\", this book is entertainment ( as the film is), and damn fine entertainment. <br />The Book tells the same story as the film, and it does so masterfully. If you enjoyed the film, then the fleshing out of the unclear or the unexplained story themes, will give some quality body to the experience of the film. The book is, in my view, definitely something you should read after  seeing the film, since the strong , extraordinary, and  intense visuals will help when reading the book. <br />The so called spoilers in another review are, I say, totally  wrong; so much so, it left me wondering which book that reviewer had read. Anyway, it's a great buy, and I wish more films had movie tie-ins, but I guess the movie world can do only so many tie-ins; this one has kept me very entertained over the course of a few days ( dipping into the book as I could), and it has been a very rewarding, and ( fittingly) entertaining read.	2005-03-01

However, it provides a very good analysis of the concept of Satan over time. The Conservatives who pretend to be Christian, whilst eschewing some books like this one, have no qualms in titling a very pro-Republican book  THE GREAT RIGHTWING  CONSPIRACY so that they can attract, or annoy people of differing political  persuasions.  This work is a must read for those who want to start understand  the form  of conceptual interpretation about the nature of evil. As to what is actually behind the evil in the world, I think this book makes no pretense to understand that; it does enlighten on what the conservative, rabid-christian enclaves have placeD into popular culture and how it has fared over time.  An excellent book.	2005-02-25

Not to say that some will not have a reaction that is visceral when either reading this book, or seeing the film, then reading the book, just that this is a scarey film/book  that does not use either the Psychological path in it's exposition, or go down the \\"Slash-Kill-Slash some more\\" school of horror. <br />It is a neat scare, and in my opinion, both the film and the book are fun scares; however, the  book and the film are not for the elite snobs who do not seem to recall the fun of a film, and a book where things that go bump in the night can provide a neat scare. <br />If you can get the book from WAL-MART, you should be able to get it for around 5 dollars. <br />It's not art, but then what fun, scarey,  and   popular film and book is these days. <br /> If you go by the formula that a Critics view is generally in inverse proportion to its fun and scarey factor, then you can't lose( Most Box office number 1 or top ten films are generally  panned by \\"highly  regarded\\"  critics, and the stuff they love is either totally a snore piece, or it is years old, and the grosses are so overwhelmingly indicative of a loved film which makes it in their best interest to \\"suddenly  discover\\"  what a hidden  masterpiece it is). <br />	2005-02-18

The Front cover was what caught me, and it was excellent luck. <br />This is a superbly  arranged set of tunes; in fact, this is more how the so-called \\"SYMPHONY\\" version by KISS should sound. Whilst this disc has material that works, and is great to listen to, the KISS  Symphony is way too busy, and is an aural  MESS !!! <br />Without a doubt, the best tune is actually Ace's remake of NY GROOVE, so its not technically a KISS tune, but it works just as well, and proves that Ace is the guts and balls of KISS. <br /> <br />About the only quartet  tribute that works as well is ANATOMY OF EVIL, the Iron Maiden Tribute. <br />	2005-01-25

I have a collection of paperback versions of Masterton's  works, and I have been consistently  impressed by his ability to scare.<br /><br />If some enterprising person would just option Masterton's works, we might find a breed of Horror film that surpassed many works.<br /><br />From the initial  discovery of the demons, through the moves to the denoument of this tale, this book delivers chills in the best possible way.<br /><br />So few writers now-a-days  can even come close to Masterton's  first person delivery. I hope that Masterton's older  works will eventually  get re-printed in hard-back, since they are worth keeping.<br /><br />This book, along with  WELLS OF HELL, and TENGU, are but one of a few that can deliver a few  sleepless  nights. Sheer magical fun from the greatest modern  horror  writer, bar none.<br /><br />ADDED: July 24, 2013:<br /><br />A memorable story from a memorable storyteller<br /><br />Graham Masterton (in many genres) created a vast catalog of superb stories. One of the earliest in the horror genre was the Devils of D-Day. The original cover (if I recall<br />correctly) was of a rather malevolent looking face: this was on a paperback edition in the late 70s, and since then the British editions have gone through a range of covers.<br />The Tor editions have had good covers, but too many times the spines have been low-quality. I can only hope that some of Masterton's brilliant horror work from what I might<br />call this earlier period in his writing will be published as either good quality hardbacks, or quality paperbacks. So far, Severn has been the principal US publisher that has<br />put out quality editions of Masterton's work. I'm just making these comments about the quality of Masterton's books (in production) since, for someone as widely read, and is<br />widely respected, so few of his books are consistently in print, and I think this is a sad state of affairs with the brilliance of his work.<br /> The Devils of D-Day is an evocative piece about a cartographer who makes a mystical discovery in an old World War II tank. And as the cartographer discovers it secret,<br />we go on a journey that only a horror master such as Masterton can create. This story is one of many I have enjoyed by Masterton, and is probably more special to me because it<br />is one of the earlier stories that I have read since I first picked up Charnel House and discovered the Graham Masterton was, and is, a past master at keeping me not only<br />drawn into the story, but terrified to turn the lights off.	2005-01-21

Whilst it is not quite yet tabloid trash, it has been so clearly surpassed by the Britannica  Almanac 2005, which has so many extras, and such detailed material, that it has now become the bench mark, and all WORLD ALMANAC  can do is hope to be able to fix its gross problems. You simply do not dumb down a reference work in order to get extra sales.  Two stars for its ability to keep a broken table leg up.	2004-11-23

Whilst they assert they are in the majority, that remains to be seen.  What is germaine in this area, is that few of the lay  christians who fall under the rubric of \\"Neo-con\\" can answer Russell's  arguments. In fact, try and ask the Christian Neo-cons about almost any of their social revisionist points, and they can rarely find a valid argument, and the end result, if you are lucky enough to find someone who will discuss things with you, is something like \\"...well... that is what I believe..\\", and at worst you run the risk of being physically harmed by some of these people. Just witness some of the reviews of books called \\"Liberal\\" when they hit too close to the mark.  Russell's line of thought is still worthy of examination, even if some of the key points have been challenged by some revisions in the pro-\\"Christian\\" side of the discussion.  Someone really should do a book \\"HOW TO TALK WITH A CONSERVATIVE: If you really  Must\\".	2004-11-17

Personally I liked the way some scenes at least gave a background to actions, even if a \\"madeup\\" reason is given. However, the visual stun that the opening section of the film gives is just superb, and the writer could at least have delivered something just as powerful. And yes, the film has gross scenes, so the book delivers on some of those, but still , as a novelisation it could at least have followed a first person narrative method to convey the film in a much better way. Still, worth the read. <br />	2004-11-16

The best way to understand, and perhaps \\"use\\" this book is with a History of the period. There is so much that surrounded this period, by way of historical ,contextual \\"bracketing\\" that reading this book on it's own is basically an unreading of the historical understanding that can be gleaned.  The text itself is on one level, self evident, however, the motivatations are not, IMO, immediately, evident in a straight reading.  If you can find a book studying the Book, and the period, then the understanding revealed is invaluable.  I do suspect that a similar book could and would be produced by certain groups if they had the chance... come to think of it, many books of this kind have been produced by extremists of various kinds.  Bottom line... history repeats itself... its about time Humanity started learning from its mistakes.	2004-10-18

About all I can suggest is that you read this book back to back with Richard Clarkes AGAINST ALL  ENEMIES. Franken is very passionate, and when he does descend to opinion, it is totally on the mark, as well as being entertaining.  The one method that I like a lot with Franken, is that he does look at the right's material; it is not like he whips up the material from nothing... key example in this point is the \\"I (...)SLAP BERNIE...\\"   chapter.  Nothing Franken says contradicts Clarkes detailed work, and I would recommend these books as a duo.    Franken's method is solid, as well as entertaining, a trait that I wish other politicians would follow more often.	2004-10-12

The very fact that later \\"introductory\\"  books have been dumbed down is testimony to that fact.  The most ideal candidate for this book is someone with 3-4  languages under their belt. And even then, you will need a Sanskrit Grammar, a Very Good Dictionary, as well as a Verbal Root book ( All available from Motilal  Banarsidass publishers), as well as a few handbooks with specialist information if you are reading certain Puranas.    Probably the best way into this book for those without a background in classical  languages is with a study group, or a Sanskrit class. On average, you will likely need 6 months experience in reading and translating before this book becomes totally  useful.    About the best recommend I can give in the popular sense is if you watch a lot of Hindi Movies, it allows you to understand the Sanskrit \\"asides\\" that the Bollywood actors give... the  sanskrit is spoken, and is still used ( in much the same way as some people will cite Latin, greek, and to some extent ,middle to old english).	2004-09-29

Even after reading as a many items by Masterton as I have, this was a Chiller in the Extreme.  Although it's hard to choose, I'd Rate MIRROR as a scare alongside of Masterton's  CHARNEL HOUSE, PARIAH, and THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT.  Oddly enough the paperback copy I got had a double cover ( something I was told is rare)... however I'm not sure on that one :-).  Anyway, it's a real thrill to experience Masterton's topflight scare books.  When He Kicks the fright in, he does so better than most writers, not simply horror in the currently fashionable slash-gore sense, but Horror in the full sense of the \\"Touched by another realm\\" type of horror.  Masterton is consistently good, and fires on all cylinders in this and many other books.His first person narratives take you with him down the nightmare road that leads over and through the looking glass in this case. If you can find copies of this book, its worth it, as are copies of THE WELLS OF HELL, TENGU, PARIAH, THE MANITOU, REVENGE OF THE MANITOU, CHARNEL HOUSE ( The First Masterton Horror Book I read); all of Mastertons Horror genre work are first rate, and are so good that it is very clear that either his ideas have been ripped off, or he has sold his scripts on the q.t. and made his influence known. If you like Supernatural, real deal, spooky horror, then Masterton is the way to go.  Highly recommended.	2003-12-22

It's a page turner, and it's a real thriller, with twists that only Masterton can Deliver.  As a Master of many genres, and a brilliant creator of a style that Lives in the Moment, Masterton Plays on every edge, quality and key Hubris in his players.    This book is masterfully done. The book has an explanatory interface, and in all respects the novel flows beautifully. The interviewing of the investigating police-woman, the people doing the sacrifice, life on the farm, and the ultimate denouement with the frightening supernatural character at the centre of the very scarey  events.  This is a masterful production, and is so very much like the masterful works of Masterton.	2003-11-21

A ticket to thrills and the other side.<br />Masterton always treads a fine line between this world and the next, and my view has been that his first person narrative technique has been the best way to convey the style of chills that only Masterton can Deliver.<BR>I am not totally surprised by a run of negative reviews for this work, since elitist Horror/-Supernatural Thiller fiction afficionados will seemingly always pan Masterton's work.<br />Read for what it is, a great fun ride.<BR>I have never read a Masterton Horror title that let me down. His work is just great. In fact, the core horror material like this title continues to deliver.<BR>I had thought that for a long time, Masterton was left out as an author being translated to film, but it seems that many films either lift Masterton's plots/Stories or Masterton may be writing under a pseudonym.<BR>More power to him...<br />This Book plus one other in Masterton's catalogue are brilliant Haunted House stories.<br />This book is worth every penny, and the thrills and chills are just great.	2002-10-23

Its a mystery/thriller , and I suspect Masterton rattled this one off in a week or less. My key gripe is that TRAUMA is a Paperback of BONNIE WINTER. ...TRAUMA is by no means a horror title, though it could have been, it reads more like a Screen-play submission. Apart from the detailed exposition that Masterton is a master of, the story is basically a one \\"joke\\" punchline in a supernatural sense. If you want a real jolt from Masterton, read THE MANITOU, PREY, THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT. The MANITOU was the book that hooked me to Masterton, and Masterton supposedly wrote that book in one week. Anyway, TRAUMA kept me glued, its a fun read, but in my view, Masterton has heaps better Thrillers and Supernatural scares in other books. The Detail is Great, the story flows, but... not my favorite Masterton Book.<br /><br />I think that the key to appreciating Masterton in this style is that he has Changed tone to suit the Characters and the<br /><br />Story.<br />It's a page turner, and it's a real thriller, with twists that only Masterton can Deliver.<br />As a Master of many genres, and a brilliant creator of a style that Lives in the Moment, Masterton Plays on every edge,<br /><br />quality and key Hubris in his players.<br /><br />About the Only Caveat for this Book is that People should know that this is the Paperback version of the HardBack<br /><br />BONNIE WINTER.<br /><br />I suspect that the title Change is for a Movie Option, and I certainly hope so. Since Masterton has very many Books<br /><br />that SHOULD be delivered into the Film World.<br /><br />Another Master-piece by the Master of First Person Narrative Horror, Supernatural Horror, the only True Fictional<br /><br />Horror there is in this realm.	2002-04-01

When I quickly got to THE MANITOU, I loved the supernatural thrills, and the spine-tingling power of Masterton's work.The key thing to know about Masterton's style is that he is down to earth and follows a first person narrative technique which totally takes you there. Masterton has absolutely no other peer. He acquints you with each character, and every situation is finely detailed. With this in mind, when he goes to such lengths, Masterton makes for the best and most powerful scares this side of Clive Barker, except that Masterton is very accessible. He is clearly not out to impress with how many words he can churn out, not how many technical flips he can do, masterton Achieves his power by straight forward high quality scares in a simple yet non-condescending manner. From interviews and reports, it seems that Masterton can produce a book very quickly. The few mistakes in story and plot that I am aware of are basically the fault of an editor. According to the accounts, Masterton produced this book inside of 2 weeks, basically to see if he could, and he did. He seems to have little patience for writers who take up to a year or more to produce a book... not a complaint, but what annoys me incredibly is just how little of Masterton's back catalogue is in print. It is not clear if sales figures are the reason for this, or something else.   This special edition is a great bonus, and has material  not seen in published material. If you want to read a great item that shows how finely Graham crafts a work with deft skill, see the story SEPSIS in either Chapbok format ( I was lucky to get a autographed version) and it also is in a collection I think called CARNIVAL OF FEAR, and if you go to Graham's website as at the writing of this part ( 2013), check the fiction section for a story called ERIC THE PIE, and you can see a Master writer at work. Whether it is the supernatural chill, or the political Horror Thrillers, CHAOS THEORY, GENIUS ( both non-supernatural, but brilliant reads ), Graham crafts his work like the past master of prose and character exposition that his fans, or friends ( as Graham Calls us  ) does; All I know is that since I started reading his work, I have never been disappointed with any of his stories. 9 Oct 2015: Excellent version of the MANITOU from 1988 with an intro by Bernhadt J Hurwood. Love this version came in great condition.	2000-10-07
