Eventually this happened, around page 300 or so (she briefly visited a crime scene earlier in the book). My main complaints are: <br />* the editing is really, really bad. There are spelling mistakes and strange grammatical errors. <br />* the repetition of ideas. Very similar things are said by different people, and each character is introduced with an explanation of what they have done in the series so far (useful for new readers, but I wouldn't advise starting with this book!) <br />* the sex and emotional angst! Oh! the angst! Anita has sooo much sex, with sooo many people. (On the plus side, she doesn't feel as guilty about most of it as she has in previous books.) <br /> <br />If you are new to this series, start with the earlier books - they have more plot, and you would find this hard to follow. I did still enjoy this book, despite the above points.	2004-11-02

As such, there is no particular plot - indeed, the conversation doesn't really go anywhere either. Each bear makes statements which he doesn't seem to understand, then tries to explain what he means to the other bear. (For example, at the start of the book one bear announces that he is an Idle Bear, but doesn't know why. Several pages later he states that his owner was an Idle, and that's why he's an Idle Bear.)<br />I found it very hard to read, as it didn't follow any plot or train of thought, and assume it would also be difficult to listen to. The Idle Bear has been translated into several languages, and so it must have an appeal for certain readers. The pictures of the two pondering bears are very lovely.	2004-05-28

It tells the story of a (fairly stupid) modern-day prince who is sent out on a quest and (due to a near accident driving the wrong way on a freeway) finds himself wandering about in Storyland among fairytale characters. The King has sworn to abdicate if his son can prove that he is clever, brave, and bring back a girl who would make a good queen. Fortunately, the Prince's page has more than two brain cells to rub together.<br />Graham Oakley is just as irreverent as usual, and packs the story with wonderfully detailed pictures (you may need a magnifying glass) and lovely sarcastic remarks. It should be appreciated by fans of the Church Mice series or people who enjoy fractured fairytales.	2003-10-17

The influence of many designers and performers is described in brief.<br />Unfortunately, the publisher provided no index to the information, and only a very vague contents page. (eg. Acoustic guitars, section 2: Twentieth Century Developments pp. 79-218)  It can hardly be called a directory if there's no way of looking up the information!  <br />If you just want a book to read cover-to-cover or to open randomly, though, this could be the book for you.	2003-09-28

I borrowed a copy of the original edition from my local library years ago, and was thrilled to find the third edition (c1993) at a bookshop recently. (Sadly, the composer passed away in 1994, so no further editions are likely.)<br />The third edition includes additional settings of &quot;Bilbo's last song&quot; and &quot;Luthien Tinuviel&quot; (from the Silmarillion) and comes with a CD that contains recordings of the whole song cycle, accompanied by piano.

I found the first story to be a little dull but the rest are quite enjoyable, and there is a Pip and Flinx story written just for the anthology. <br />There is also a comment from the author at the start of the book about why he writes short fiction, and a brief note at the start of each story explaining where the idea came from, where he was at the time of writing it, or just an insight into his personality.	2002-11-07

As you can guess, this series is set in an alternate reality where fantasy creatures exist and vampires have recently gained legal &quot;human&quot; status. <br />Anita herself has some interesting personal conflicts - she is a committed Christian who works with dark forces and kills a little too easily, and a very dainty and pretty-looking person who considers herself to be &quot;tough as nails&quot; (it makes it hard for the bad guys to take her seriously).<br />Each of the books is loosely based around a supernatural mystery and the ongoing story of Anita's life (she's 20-something at the start of this book). The writing is a little sloppy, but quite compelling, and the series steadily improves for the first few novels (the later ones get a little bogged down with Anita's issues).	2002-10-02

He proposes that the 5 critical turning points in Western musical history were:<BR>1. Invention of notation (music transferable without memorisation, complicated works became possible)<BR>2. Opera (sung drama)<BR>3. Equal temperament (the modern tuning system which corrects - on average - the Harmonic Series found by Pythagoras)<BR>4. The piano (&quot;the amazing loud and soft machine&quot;)<BR>5. Recorded sound<br />He goes into quite a bit of detail about what made these discoveries special and what they meant to music and society at the time.

Books	5	3	4	N	N	Charming peep-through pictures	\\"Baby Bilby, where do you sleep?\\" is a lovely combined story and information book for young children. It explores the secret world of the Australian desert, as the reader asks each animal where it sleeps (you get a glimpse through a cut-out page) and then turns the page to find out.  It's a nice book for reading at bed-time, or for hunting through the pictures for hidden things. (Bilbies are tiny little marsupials with pointed noses - as seen on the front cover.)<br />Baby Bilby was a 2002 honour book for both the Children's Book Council of Australia's \\"Book of the Year: Early Childhood\\" and Eve Pownall Award for Information Books categories.	2002-09-12

At this point of Darkovan history, the planet (a lost colony of Earth) has been rediscovered by the Terran Empire. It works well as a single volume, as it's the three-part story of a &quot;Terran&quot; woman (Margali) who becomes involved in the guild by accident, and her personal growth as a result.<br />Personally, I find the third story rather tedious - it is a quest story in which a group of women go searching for a mythical or secret Women's City, involving a lot of walking through frozen mountains and (I thought) a fairly anticlimactic ending.<br />Some of the Terran gender relations in the book seem somewhat dated, reading like a reflection of the late 70s-early 80s period when the stories were written, although the alien Darkovan version seems much less so.<br />In general, a rewarding book, which should appeal to anyone who enjoys speculative fiction with strong feminist characters.	2002-09-02

It is set about 1000 years after colonisation, during the period that the ruling families warring against one another and were breeding for Laran (psi-powers).<br />Unfortunately, this edition is really, really awful to read because of poor editing - every now and again there is a sentence that makes no sense until the reader suddenly realises that a word is missing a letter, or a word is missing entirely from the sentence. eg. \\"He could see it in her yes...\\" - yes=Eyes<br />Apart from the cryptic editing, it is still a good read for Darkover fans (not the best to start reading the series with), and a cheap way to buy a couple of classic SF/FAN novels.	2002-07-02

It starts well, with Flinx finding out that he's capable of being not-so-nice when necessary, but tends to fall into a one-thing-after-another novel as it progresses. <br />This novel feels rather like a short story with filler. Pip and Flinx fans should certainly read it, as it develops Flinx's understanding of the Meliorare society and himself (although, as is traditional, it raises more questions). Besides, after such a long wait, anything will be a nice read. If you have never read a Pip and Flinx novel, however, *please* don't start with this one - you'll get entirely the wrong idea about this charming series.	2002-06-19

Sadly, the \\"voice\\" slips towards the end of the book, and the last portion is just a setup for the next book.<br />I wouldn't recommend this to someone who hasn't read the rest of the series, but you won't need to re-read the whole story before tackling this enormous book (maybe just look over the last chapter of Plains to remember where it ended). Auel peppers the novel with reminders of what went on in the previous books (helpful, but a little annoying if you've just read the others in a marathon session, which I had...), and (thank goodness) she included a list of names at the end - I think it's the most characters she's had yet! <br />On the whole, fans will want to have a look at this new chapter in Ayla's life, repetition and all, but try to get it from a public library first.	2002-04-30

Clarke's component in this series is the inclusion of a number of his interesting short stories as the subplots with very little alteration of the details. (The original book titles were actually the names of the stories, eg. Breaking Strain.) These stories are seamlessly incorporated into the whole work.<br />What is added by Preuss is the style and setting - Sparta, a fragile but superhuman woman who has lost her past, searches for the people who made her what she is. In doing so, she becomes involved in the situations created in Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction. The \\"Venus Prime\\" series maps out her journey (as well as serving up great stories by Clarke). Preuss peppers the books with nice details of life in the near future (like logical extensions, interesting-but-plausible technology, and so on).<br />If you're looking for the original short stories, several appeared in the out-of-print collection \\"The Sentinel ; masterworks of science fiction and fantasy\\" (the title story is also interesting as the origin of Clarke's novel \\"2001 a Space Odyssey\\").	2002-03-11

The book is identical except in its smaller size (24 x 18 cm) and cover, but is less than half the price of the larger edition (strangely, I've seen both books together on shelves when browsing bookshops). The reduced size pages are still quite clear and readable.<br />As a book, it's very attractive - full colour glossy photographs on each page illustrate the models (good for diagram-impaired people, although they are sometimes a bit tricky to follow) - and features a gallery of models at the start of the book and instructions in basic folds and bases. It's good for giving a new folder a taste of lots of different models, but if you have a few books already you'll probably find that you have most of these designs.	2001-11-11

He is let loose on society and becomes a nexus, altering what he come in contact with.<br />It's hard to spell out why this book is so good, but it's a real original in the Fantasy genre and definitely my favourite series (I read an awful lot of F/SF).	2001-10-24

Typical Church Mice pandemonium results.<br />There are some particularly wonderful details at the &quot;Wortlethorpe Canine and Feline Resettlement Department&quot; such as the treatment of the agressive cats (&quot;cold baths twice daily until unaggressive&quot;) and the unfriendly dogs (&quot;starve until friendly&quot;), as well as a thrilling chase which culminates in the ruination of the official opening of the &quot;Wortlethorpe Museum European Tea-Cosy and Muff Wing.&quot;<br />Check Amazon.co.uk to see if this book is currently in print.	2001-09-25

A girl visits her silly Grandfather, but when she arrives she feels that something is wrong and tries to guess what it is. Everything in Grandfather's house is very surreal - things work backwards, furniture is really animals - and kids (and adults) can spend hours finding things wrong in the detailed pictures. At the end of the story she realises what's wrong, and it's nothing that the reader will guess!	2001-09-17

Unfortunately, Sampson gets kidnapped by a couple of criminals on a tandem bike (due to the local paper miss-reporting of the size of his winnings) and the mice have to go to his rescue for a change. <br />This book seems to wander in and out of print - it may be worth trying Amazon.co.uk as their listing of Graham Oakley books in print is generally more accurate.	2001-09-09

Illustrated by Ron Brooks (who did &quot;John Brown, Rose and  the Midnight Cat&quot; among many others), the pages are bathed in reds, oranges and blacks, and has the text written in a dark scrawl, sometimes at strange angles.<br />Set in the aftermath of a bushfire (forest fire), a one-eyed dog befriends a magpie bird who can no longer fly and gently nurses her back to emotional health. Magpie rides on Dog's back to simulate flying, and acts as a new eye for him. This happy state is endangered when a feral Fox comes and lives with them. Fox is also damaged, but only on the inside ; he is jealous of their great friendship (due to his own inability to love) and works to destroy it. From the ending, it is not clear if he failed.<br />&quot;Fox&quot; is probably best for 8/9 years and up, as the dark imagery and open ending can be could be upsetting for small children but it is an interesting and thought provoking book for older readers.	2001-09-03

Probably about half or more of the pieces are ones that I haven't come across before  - good for sight reading practice and a bit of variety.<br />An excellent book for beginners in particular, with lots of things of varying difficulty that will keep you busy for a while and give you a taste of lots of composers.	2001-08-01

Many of the pieces are commonly included in collections (Traumerei, Fur Elise, Fantasy-Impromptu) but others are more unusual. A few of the composers include: Albeniz, Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Brahms, Debussy, Faure, Scott Joplin ... it's a long list.<br />The book itself features:   Handy ring-binding, without which it would never stay open;  clear printing (not one of those publications that looks like it's gone through a fax); and good editing.<br />I would particularly recommomend this book to people trying to increase the size of their music library (done instantly) or people who want to get a taste of numerous musical styles and composers. The variety in levels of the music can keep you dipping into this book from low-intermediate through to the higher grades.	2001-07-29

It will teach you heaps of things about mythology and therefore turn you into a brainiac (don't mention that JKR made up quite a few of the Beasts). &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot; is obviously a history book about a team sport, and so must be good for you.<br />Don't mention that they're more of that dreadful Harry Potter, though. Or that they're funny - esp. the notes by Harry and friends in the margins, etc. Quidditch lacks the wonderful notes by Our Heroes, of course, because it's a library book and anyone who writes in books from magical libraries are automatically cursed.

The letters are long and detailed, since she rather missed him and was also trying to give him the full experience as much as possible. As a result, this book is a feast for both fans of LIW's work and people with an interest in the culture of the period.<br />At this time, Laura is in her forties and has begun writing freelance for at least one magazine, but has not started on her famous Little House books yet. Her daughter is working entirely as a writer, particularly of serialised stories/biographies.<br />Warning: Anyone reading the Rose series by Roger Lea MacBride should leave this book until after they finish, as there are spoilers.	2001-03-19

As it is a transcription of a diary that Laura kept during her long journey to the &quot;Land of the Big Red Apple,&quot; it is more interesting than gripping. Laura would have been trying to save paper by being fairly tacit in her records, so while there's a number of interesting happenings they aren't fleshed out in great detail or with the rich descriptions that she's known for. I certainly did enjoy it, however.<br />(Additionally, she probably intended this diary for her own use, so she goes into a lot of things like the state of the crops and price of land in different places.)	2001-03-16

Don't let this fool you, though; even if the monsters are legally &quot;human,&quot; they are still dangerous and frightening.<br />Anita Blake, our hero, is a very short woman (with an extremely large attitude) who raises Zombies from the dead for a living and helps out the police with &quot;preternatural crimes&quot; on the side. She is also very biased against the monsters, but finds herself drawn further and further into their dark world. <br />While I love this series dearly (I read the first 4 books within a week and then had to wait for the next to be published), LKH's writing style is sometimes a little sloppy. The interesting characterisations and energetic plot makes up for this, however. I don't usually read horror, but found this story extremely compelling.	2001-03-02

Fans of the Church Mice series will love this book about a Hen Odyssey across the British countryside. Hetty (a birdbrain) is convinced by her slightly older and marginally more intelligent (but rather impractical) friend Harriet that life would be better somewhere other than the barnyard. This takes them to increasingly worse places, including a fox hole (so nice and cosy), the Michelangelo shopping precinct (which seems to be entirely made up of shops belonging to the Scroggins family), and the local Lost Property office (where they are sold off by the Scroggins &amp; Scroggins auction house).<br />Fortunately they manage to excape the dastardly clutches of the Techno-Egg and Fowlfare organisations, and probably live happily ever after. <br />This is a definite must-read for anyone who likes droll English humour, although it's a bit hard to find.	2001-01-30

My Mum in particular found the seriesa wonderful escapist experience for reading after work.<br />The onlynegative I could say about the series is that it brought theimaginative, Fantasy genre to the attention of people who think thatanything out of the mundane must be of the occult.

Merry Gentry is a small woman, with a fair bit of angst about her upbringing and with developing supernatural powers, but she differs from AB in that she is completely together about her sexuality and (due to her fey upbringing) has a morale code largely unlike that of human society.<br />Anita Blake fans may be pleased to know that at no time does Merry mention the phrase &quot;Point for me/us,&quot; hang up the phone without saying goodbye, or nod while talking on the phone and then realise that the other person couldn't see her, although she does obsess about hair, eyes and groovy clothes quite as much as Our Girl Anita. :)<br />That being said, I still read the book in almost one sitting, and, despite a few items that I thought could use work (the interesting detective agency that gets ditched in the first part of the book, Merry never even calling her workmates/friends to tell them she's OK, great characters that will probably be developed in *future* books) it is a very obsorbing read, and has a cute bit of alternate history (what really happened to Hitler).

The book we read is a combination of book that the academic *nearly* published about Ash, and the e-mails that pass between him and his editor (this works better than it sounds). <br />The Ash story is compiled from the academic's translation of medieval latin texts (rendered into modern English, so Ash's soldier cursing has been translated into modern strong cursing), and is written as an entertaining novel with some pseudo-academic footnotes. <br />At first, the story would appeal to any historical novel reader (as long as they're OK with strong language and violence), but later in the series it gets into fantasy and also explores the possible nature of time and space quite a bit.<br />The long chapter-less parts make for late night reading (while you wait for a good place to stop), but I had no regrets for the dark rings around my eyes in the morning.<br />If you can't wait for the final volume, the whole work is published as a huge trade paperback in Britain (although reading it like that in one go can send you around the bend!), available at Amazon UK.	2000-10-26

The minister's cat is a Crazy cat...a Dutiful cat...an Elegant cat...<br />In this book, Lynley Dodd has put a Minister's Cat alphabet together to read aloud, with her usual smashing illustrations. It isn't as much fun as her Hairy Macleary books (which is why I give it 4 stars), but it might spark some interesting driving games (if you want to try making it up for yourself).	2000-10-24

Wombat tries out for all of the parts in the Nativity play, but he's such a big clumsy muddle of a wombat that they can't find a part for him to play. Finally they think of the perfect role for him - the sleeping baby Jesus.<br />Wombat's various disasters are very funny for kids, and the Australian animals are very well drawn (lots of character). Wombat Divine is a great addition to the bookshelf.	2000-10-24

The structure is very repetitive, so they know exactly when to say that they &quot;wouldn't say boo to a goose,&quot; and all of the other, braver things that they would do instead are funny to slightly older kids too.<br />The explanation of why the storyteller is scared of geese comes suddenly at the end, and wraps it up nicely (and in a silly way).	2000-10-24

The farmer decides to shear his sheep into shapes (lots of different shapes to recognise), not that the sheep seem to be very happy about being squares, piramid or heart shaped!

Kids love this &quot;building&quot; story - Hairy Macleary from Donaldson's Dairy (a tangley little black dog) goes for a walk, and is gradually joined by lots of other dogs with impossible rhyming names. The dogs increase until Disaster! - they meet Scarface Claw, the toughest tomcat in town. (A screetchy meow is necessary at this point.)<br />Lynley Dodd has a wonderful tumpity-tum rhythm throughout the book that makes it great fun to read. It also makes a good flannelboard for storytimes (not too many pieces to make, either).<br />The only caveat is that if you buy this book you will be made to read it over and over - although it's fun to try and remember all of the dogs' names: Schnitzel Von Krum (with a *very* low tum), Bottomley Potts (all covered in spots), Hercules Morse (as big as a horse)...<br />Ignore the editorial reviews above - they relate to &quot;Hairy Macleary : rumpus at the vet&quot; and &quot;Dragon in a wagon&quot;	2000-10-24

All the dogs from the first Hairy Macleary are back and making all sorts of barks, and then there's the sound that echoes around...<br />If you haven't read any Hairy Macleary yet (and why not!!?), they are great read-aloud stories with plenty of tumpity rhythm and rhymes.

Humphrey and Arthur are abducted by a couple of really shifty-looking scientists to become part of the Wortlethorp Space Program (set up in a local cow field).

He uses his powers to grant speech to his Dog Macchiato (Spot)and to call an angel, Raphael, who gives him music lessons on the lute. At least, that is how the story begins. War comes to his sleepy Italian town, and drives him out into the world, which is rather ill prepared for.<br />The story is written freshly and the characters are all real and well rounded out.<br />The Black Dragon (from &quot;tea with the...&quot;) also makes a nice cameo appearance in the third part in his dragon form.	2000-10-21

This book is a very valuable resource for public librarians acting as a reader's adviser (&quot;I like this author, who/what else would I like?&quot;), but I can't imagine anyone having the time to be poring over the pages as a collection development tool. <br />Genreflecting is also a great reference for writing or literature studies students who are studying genre - along with lists of authors that they can pursue, there are very lucid discussions of the genres, and it's a good starting point for assignments in this area.

Most of the humour is in the fantastically detailed funny pictures, which clash delightfully with the serious-sounding text. This is my favourite of the Church Mice stories. Some wonderful scenes include the Mice raffling-off Sampson (the Church Cat) to raise money for their party, their hopeless attempts at carol-singing for the same purpose, and the burglar dressed as Santa (he has a bag on which he has crossed out &quot;Swag&quot; and written &quot;presents&quot;). Also look out for the bizarre Christmas window displays in town.<br />If you can't find them here, many of Graham Oakley's books are now in print through Amazon.co.uk<br />This is a book for re-reading over and over. Each time you look at it you find more wonderful detail. Church Mice are for life, not just for Christmas.	2000-10-19

I put it down at around 2 am hoping to make it last, tried to sleep for a couple of hours, and had to get up and read to the finish.<br />(I am one of the lucky Australians who could grab it last year in its all-black limited edition cover: just the number 7 on the spine and a string of barbed-wire.

Montgomery Books)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A charming, old-fashioned love story	If you like sweet, gentle stories, this could be the book for you. Kilmeny of the Orchard is more like a long short story or novela than Montgomery's other works - there isn't any real deviation from the main plotline of the romance, or a great deal of character fleshing-out, and it may be a little too melodramatic for some. Her usual humour comes through in some passages, though - poking a little fun at the small-town people.<br />The story is entirely from the point of view of Eric, who is dabbling in a little small-town teaching, so the character of Kilmeny is not fully explored (unlike Anne and her other female protagonists). Kilmeny is seen through the eyes of a besmitten youth, and may seem rather too good to be true. <br />Also, some people may be offended by turn of the century attitudes. What must be remembered is that this book was written for another time, when political correctness had not yet been invented. Italians were firey-tempered; a hired boy, even one raised by your family, is not the sort for a well-bred lass to consider; children born out of wedlock were a shame and a black mark on the family; and, disabilities made the sufferer a cripple or a defective. The small-town people of the story are very traditional, too, and also quite superstitious.<br />I found Eric to be rather more like a young girl's fantasy hero rather than any man that I've met, but he was quite likeable. (A young person's Mr Darcy?) Overall, the story is light, fun, and very sweet. If you aren't in the mood for heavy realism, it is a pleasant change.	2000-10-05

I would certainly not recommend fans to avoid it (especially younger readers), but I found the subplot to be tedious. The story switches between Acorna's story and a secondary story, chapter by chapter.<br />(I actually didn't read much of the subplot - I found it so dull that I skipped those chapters and rather enjoyed the rest of the story! I'm giving this book 3 stars because I understood the Acorna story while only reading every other chapter.)	2000-09-27

Of course the story has aged quite a lot (the dates given in the story have already long past - the trouble with setting things in the near future!), but the concepts are still interesting. <br />The plot progresses through short stories - which makes it a little disjointed. Following on in this timeline are &quot;Pegasus in flight&quot; and &quot;Pegasus in space&quot; which are in standard novel form.	2000-09-27

The stories include hard SF and fantasy, futuristic warfare, quieter &quot;character&quot; tales, and revisits the world of Paksenarrion to tell the story of a minor character.<br />Moon gives a brief note with each story to indicate her inspiration or the circumstances in which it was written, which adds additional interest.

Johnny's best friends include Wobbler  (a computer hacker), Yo-less (named because he never says Yo), and Bigmac  (who lives in the rough part of town).<br />Johnny Maxwell, while his parents  are going through &quot;trying times&quot; and the Gulf War is getting  going on the tele, was playing a shoot-em-up computer game when he found  that the Mighty ScreeWee(tm) Empire had no interest in fighting back, and  wanted to surrender.

Nomes live 10 times faster than humans, which is why no-one  notices them, and they are getting squeezed out of their home by human  development. They go forth to try and find somewhere for themselves, but  this is very tricky when you're only a couple of inches high.<br />The books  are very thin, which is good for reluctant readers - not so daunting to  start reading, and then exciting enough to keep them going. I would also  recommend it to anyone going through Harry Potter withdrawals.<br />Rather  than purchase the three books individually (which you *will* want to do if  you buy the first one!) you would be better off trying to get &quot;The  Bromeliad&quot; which is a hardcover collection of the trilogy - actually  cheaper and set to stand up to lots of re-reading.	2000-09-20

Fortunately, the Dead are a lot more like  old people than the shambling undead that you see in late night movies, and  they develop a keen interest in what's going on out there.<br />I found this  book to be more fun than the first book &quot;Only you can save  mankind.&quot; The dead are very likable, and it raises some thoughts about  where you go when you become &quot;vertically challenged.&quot; It stands  alone well if you have not read the earlier book.	2000-09-20

Each section  has many practice exercises (answers in the back of the book) to cover all  possible things that you might come accross in the real world.<br />The  authors are well qualified to produce this workbook - Helena Dittmann was  the head of the University of Canberra cataloguing department for many  years, and Jane Hardy also has much experience with LCC.

The story is entirely from the point of view of Marina through her diary entries. She  doesn't speak anymore and in boarding school her only outlet is the journal  that she has to keep for English.<br />As the story progresses, Marsden gives  us tantalising hints of what is going on in her life, what happened to make  her this way, which is nicely resolved by the end of the story.<br />If the  story ends too soon for you, the sequel &quot;Take my word for it,&quot;  does the same sort of thing with another girl living in the same dorm. She  sees the events of &quot;So Much to Tell You&quot; from a different  viewpoint, and the story goes on past the ending of the first book.<br />This  is a great read for teens. John Marsden was a teacher for many years, and  really understands how young people think. It is mainly a girls book,  however, unlike the Tomorrow series which has a more general appeal due to  its action orientation.	2000-09-07

She has an obvious feminist bias, as would be expected from the  title, but this is refreshing after reading works with a patriachal bias -  every researcher has their own slant on things after all! <br />In reading  this book I came accross some errors (a few things that I happened to know  for certain), which I assume crept in because it is such a huge work - she  has attempted to cover the entirety of feminine mythology and ancient  history in one work. <br />Christian readers may find this book offensive, as  it seeks out pagan roots behind basic Christian beliefs, but others will  probably enjoy it for its different ideas.	2000-09-05

This book has good  characterisations, and I don't have any quibbles with the plot, but  throughout the story I kept thinking: &quot;OK, they all live in a carpet.  Um, is this an abandoned house, or will there be vaccuuming?&quot;  Likewise, there is a huge penny in the carpet that has been there for years  - will someone pick up this penny? I considered that perhaps miniature  people had shorter years, but they experience regular length days. These  little problems made it hard for me to really get into the storytelling.	2000-09-01

Both books are episodic in nature, but Dark Genesis tells a  grim story with real human people - and McCaffrey's story is a sweet  fairytale by comparison. In fact, I thought that McCaffrey's book read  rather like a piece of Psi Corps propaganda. Although Dark Genesis is set  in the B5 universe, the characters that we know have not yet been born. It  is an excellent book, however.	2000-08-29

The artwork's pretty good  - it actually looked like the actors sometimes, which is pretty amazing.  The plots of the short stories wouldn't make an episode, but they're funny  and it's great brain mush.	2000-08-29

I loved the first two books in this series, and liked this one ...until  the ending! It was a huge disapointment, and showed no respect for the  characters (or readers) to end in the manner that it did.	2000-08-29

The  author wrote this series based on information included in a few letters,  and this is entirely apparent in the characterisation and feel of the  series. That being said, if you've finished the current book in the Rose  series and are desperate for more you will want to read it anyway.	2000-08-29

There is a mystery, a little  supernatural activity, and the brilliant characterisations that you would  expect from this author. To fully appreciate the story you should have read  Tea, which is sadly out of print, but it stands alone as a good read.	2000-08-29

Schindler's illustrations are fabulous - the cats live and move - and Ursula LeGuin's characterisations are spot on  too. Jane, one of the Catwings, gets bored with her quiet life on the farm  and decides to have &quot;adventures.&quot; Unfortunately she falls in with  a guy who, while seeming to love her, keeps her locked up and performing  tricks for television cameras.<br />This story is a wonderful fantasy for cat  lovers of all ages. The moral (if you need a little medicine in your sugar)  is that if you really love someone, you'll give them their freedom.	2000-08-07
