US	52760003	RODLDWX4FZCTA	0786708476	158828792	The Barrens	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Joyce Carol Oates Lite?	Although this novel has some Oates-ian touches, this is not a typical Joyce Carol Oates novel, which is presumably where the &quot;Writing as Rosamund Smith&quot; tagline comes into play.  The basic plot is pretty much what you'd expect from an Oates novel:  Matt McBride, a thirty-six year old man haunted by the abduction and murder of a young girl that occured when he was fifteen, becomes obsessed with the disappreance of a young woman who lives nearby.  Matt sinks further into obsession at the cost of his marriage and career, but he won't rest until he finds out exactly what has happened to Duana Zwolle.<br />Oates also takes us tinto the mind of the killer, Name Unknown.  Name Unknown has an obsession of his own -- ridding the world of impure, vulgar women.  The passages written from Name Unknown's point of view are somewhat reminiscent of the narrative voice of Quentin P___ from Oates's earlier novel, Zombie.  However, while Name Unknown's thoughts and actions are disturbing, they are nowhere near as frightening as the things Quentin does.<br />The Barrens also has a more satisfying conclusion -- almost a happy ending -- than many of Oates's novels.  I'm reluctant to call this novel &quot;Joyce Carol Oates Lite&quot; because that sounds demeaning.  However, while this book is dark, it doesn't get nearly as dark as the aforementioned Zombie, or Foxfire, or a number of other Oates novels.  It's a book to be kept in reserve for those times when you want a compelling thriller, but not necessarily one that's going to make you think too hard about what Oates is trying to say.	2001-08-20

When my friend thrust this slim volume into my hands, I confess, I had my doubts.  Not another entry in the &quot;two-sides-to-every-story&quot; genre.  I have to admit that there are some very good novels that fall into this category -- Rys's Wide Sargasso Sea and Maguire's Wicked, to name two -- but there are some very bad novels that fall into this category as well.  Caliban's Hour, I'm happy to say, falls into the former category.<br />Particularly impressive is the way Williams managed to catch the cadences of Shakespeare's Caliban.  I had recently finished teaching Shakespeare's The Tempest in a World Literature class prior to picking up this novel, so Shakespeare's Caliban was fresh in my mind.  While Williams has a decidedly different approach to the character of Caliban (and, indeed, Ariel), he captures the rhythm and poetry of Shakespeare's character.<br />At the beginning of Williams's tale, Caliban is a character bent on revenge, and the object of his vengeance is Miranda.  It soon becomes clear, however, that what Caliban really wants is a chance to tell his side of the story, to make Miranda understand him.  Over the course of one night, he unfolds the story of his life on the island, beginning with his life with Sycorax, his mother, and culminating in the irrevocable changing of his life with the coming of Prospero and Miranda.<br />True to Caliban's promise that his story will only take one evening, this novel can, indeed, be read in one evening.  It's short -- 201 pages -- and the story is compelling enough to keep you turning pages until the story is complete.  It does, however, take more than one hour to read!	2001-08-20

His account of Ella, Lee, Brad, and Honora's experiences with lucid dreaming and the havoc these experiments unleash in their lives is a fascinating and engrossing fast-paced read.  While Joyce doesn't completely wrap up all of the loose ends, he doesn't really need to.  He gives the story the kind of closure and incident like this would have in real life:  it isn't necessary to understand everything that happens as long as the terror finally stops.	2001-08-08

The greatest strengh he reveals in his first novel is character development.  Whether the character in question is one of the novel's major figures or one of the victims in the supernatural war being waged in the streets of Boston, Marano spends time to fully flesh each character out, so that the reader really gets to know the character well.  This is particularly effective when Marano makes the reader begin to like a character, just to have him killed by a demon three pages later.  In addition, because there are so many well-thought-out characters, it's difficult to tell who the hero of the novel is, or whether there even *is* a &quot;hero&quot; in the standard sense.<br />The plot is thought-provoking as well.  When two demons battle for world dominion, who is the &quot;good guy&quot;?  Marano deftly avoids the plot pitfall of bringing in God to quash the demons and restore everything to normal, which was refreshing.  Instead, the tensions keep mounting until the novel's end, which makes for compelling reading.  I had to finish the book in one night because I couldn't go to sleep without knowing what was going to happen next.	2001-08-08

I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed after _Monuments and Maidens_.  I expected a more in-depth study.  Instead, these six essays barely seem to scratch the surface of the topics.  These essays are basically transcripts of six lectures Warner gave for BBC radio, which explains their brevity, but it's a shame she didn't expand upon them when she decided to publish them in print.<br />Still, there are some very interesting things here.  I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in folklore and are just starting your studies.  For the advanced student, the book just leaves you wanting more.	2001-08-08

Although most Dean Koontz novels have their share of humor, this novel is a bit more off-the-wall than most.  Of course, it has its fair share of terror, as the hero, Tommy Phan, is being chased by a monstrous demon summoned by an unknown antagonist.  However, when Tommy meets Deliverance Payne and her dog, Scootie, the fun begins in earnest.<br />The novel starts of a little bit slow, but picks up very quickly.  When the action started, I couldn't put it down!  This book demands to be read at one sitting, if at all possible.  I read it after the completion of a very stressful semester, and it was an excellent way to get rid of excess tension.	2001-07-27

All too quickly, however, Johnny's footnotes begin to tell their own story of parnoia and fear.  The story of _The Navidson Chronicle_ itself is intriguing and creepy.  Even though the action is dictated and analyzed by Zampano, there's still a great deal of suspense and tension that comes through to the reader. For example, in the section entitled &quot;Tom's Story,&quot; Zampano describes a scene in which Navidson's brother Tom is left alone in a section of the house.  Tom's fear is so palpable, that even though the events are filtered through Zampano's narrative, I got goosebumps.<br />Another of my favorite parts in the novel is the section entitled &quot;What Some Have Thought,&quot; wherein Navidsons's girlfriend asks several celebrities what they think of _The Navidson Chronicle_.  Not only do these segments show Danielewski's great sense of humor, they showcase his ability to take on specific, unique narrative voices.  When he takes on the voices of Camille Paglia, Harold Bloom, Anne Rice, and Stephen King, he completely captures their narrative styles to great comic effect.<br />One of my favorite things about this novel is that even though I read it over a year ago, I'm still thinking about it.  Is it all in Johnny's head?  Or is it one of his mother's delusions?  Or could it all be Zampano himself?  Read it and decide for yourself!	2001-07-27

Just when you begin to settle into one bizarre plot, Carter turns everything upside down and takes the story down a completely different avenue.  She still manages, however, to bring all of her seemingly disparate plot elements together at the novel's satisfying close.<br />Evelyn's transformation from loathesome creep into a protagonist the reader actually cares about is a riotous roller-coaster ride, punctuated by Carter's beautiful prose and embellished by her perverse sense of humor.  As always with Angela Carter, a satisfying, thought-provoking read!	2001-07-27

I love Terry Pratchet's Discworld novels, and I'm partial to the novels featuring the witches.  This novel, however, is by far my favorite.  Not only to you have Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Agnes Nit, you get a pack of vampires and an army of pixies -- I mean, Pictsies.<br />Although the Pictsies are amusing, what really makes this novel is the family of vampires who want to lead a normal life.  Particularly amusing is the Count's teenage daughter, Lacci (short for Lacrimosa), who does the most un-vampiric things, like staying up until noon, wearing brightly-colored clothes, and asking her friends to call her Gertrude.<br />You can never go wrong with a Discworld novel, and this one in particular is amazingly funny!	2001-07-27

I wasn't disappointed.  _Choke_ is the story of Victor Mancini, a sex addict who stages chokings in order to milk his saviors of enough cash to pay his mother's medical bills.  But is Victor himself a savior?  All of Palahnuik's novels deal with the fact that our current society has sunk so far into absurdity that we need some sort of savior to shake us up and see what we're doing to ourselves, but the question remains -- does anyone have what it takes to be that savior?<br />I can't help comparing this novel to _Survivor_, which is still my favorite Palahnuik novel, and, as an earlier reviewer mentions, the best way to review any Palahnuik novel is to compare it to his other novels.  _Survivor_  has a bit more of an edge to it than _Choke_ does.  Still, any Palahnuik novel is definitely worth reading, because there are no bad Palahnuik novels.	2001-07-27

The plot of this novel is intriguing:  the youngest Lisbon daughter, Cecilia, commits suicide, and fromt he novel's opening lines, it's clear that her four sisters follow in her footsteps.  Why Cecilia decides to kill herself is not clear to her parents, or to the group of boys whose fascinated surveilance of the Lisbon family provides the narrative force of the novel.  What is clear is that the Lisbon family is catapulted into a downward spiral of decay by Cecilia's suicide.  The novel is a fascinating look at the lives of the five Lisbon girls, told from the viewpoint of would-be saviors who are ultimately powerless.  At times, the narration takes on a quality reminiscent of the narrator(s) in Joyce Carol Oates's _Broke Heart Blues_:  the narrator is strangely anonymous -- simply one of a group who admires/fantasizes about the tragic hero/heroines they know very little about.<br />This book was wonderful but also depressing.  It took me a while to read, simply because at times the pain these girls felt was so visceral I had to set the book aside for a while.	2001-07-27

I hate reading about and teaching grammar; that's why I love this book.  Gordon has transformed the boring rules of grammar into something unique and entertaining.  My students are always pleasantly surprised when I give  them Gordon's examples, and it helps all of us get through what would  ordinarily be a grueling process.  I think the illustrations for the  example sentences are what make this book really come alive for the reader.  It also helps that this book uses examples involving vampires, penguins,  and hot flashes, things that we normally wouldn't expect to see in the same  place.  Gordon's book is also a great way to build vocabulary.  Many of the  words she uses are unfamiliar to the average college freshman, so I give my  students extra credit vocabulary assignments from her examples.  As  previous reviewers have said, this book is by no means the best grammar  book out there -- in some cases, a quick-reference guide may be more useful  -- but it's one of the more entertaining guides.	2000-06-15

This is one of those books that I couldn't put down, but at the same time, I didn't want it to end.  The story is great, but the characters are what really make this novel worthwhile.  My favorites have to be Mr. Croup and  Mr. Vandemar, the hired assassins who are absolutely, disgustingly,  hysterically funny.  They get the great lines like:  &quot;Things to do.  People to damage.&quot;  Door is the intriguing heroine of the novel who  reminds me a little bit of Morpheus's sister, Death, from the _Sandman_  series.  Characters like Hunter and the Marquis de Carabas add comic relief  and adventure to Richard's experience in London Below.  And  Richardrichardmayhewdick?  Well, as the hero of the novel, he leaves much  to be desired -- at first, anyway -- but he grows on you.<br />One of my  favorite scenes has to be the scene where Door and the Marquis are  auditioning assassins.  I laughed so hard that everyone in the office  demanded to know what was so funny.  I ended up doing a dramatic reading  for the benefit of my colleagues.  This is one of the dangers of reading  Gaiman in a public place.<br />The novel does have it's dark spots.  Croup and  Vandemar, for all their comic scenes, are assassins, and they do their job  well.  The Great Beast of London is no laughing matter, either, and to top  it all off, there is a traitor among Richard and Door's companions.<br />When  I finished reading the novel, I found myself wishing I could visit a place  like London Below.  I've since read the novel three times, and each time I  come away from it more and more impressed by Gaiman's gifted storytelling.	2000-06-10

Reading this novel was like running your fingers over a fine brocade; the novel has a rich texture and an intriguing plot.  I love the way Harrison  approaches the questions of religion and heresy, making these themes of the  novel particularly important by placing her narrative in the time frame of  the Spanish Inquisition.  I have to take issue with those who dismiss this  novel as a glorified romance novel.  There's a lot more to Francisca and  Alvaro's relationship than sex, and the juxtaposition of the situations of  the two women highlights this difference.<br />This was the first Kathryn  Harrison novel I ever read, and it made Harrison one of my favorite  writers, deservedly so.  This novel will remain one of my top ten all-time  favorite books, mainly because of Harrison's gorgeous prose.	2000-06-10

From the first five pages, where Dobyns describes finding the bodies of the girls, I was hooked.  Even when I had figured out why the girls had been kidnapped and killed, I had no idea who had done it.  When I read this  book a second time, a year later, and knew who the killer was, Dobyns's  writing is so powerful, and the story so unpredictable, that I began to  doubt my memory.<br />The really disturbing aspect of the novel is the way the  townspeople begin to distrust each other, and the fact that some people  even go so far as to act violently towards people who were once their  friends.  Most upsetting, though, is the ending. I won't give anything away  here, you'll have to read it for yourselves.<br />This novel is deliciously  creepy and sometimes quite grahpic.  If you prefer your thrillers without  graphic crime scene descriptions, you might want to check out Dobyns's  later novel, _The Boy in the Water_.  However, the scenes here are not  gratuitous -- they are very necessary to the plot of the novel.  This  killer's violence is in many ways symbolic, and these descriptions are  important to solving the mystery.  All in all, this novel is an excellent  read, and will gratify mystery and horror readers alike.<br />I can't wait to  read another thriller from Stephen Dobyns!	2000-06-10

This novel is even better than Jackson's more famous _The Haunting of Hill House_.  This is a novel about madness, but until the middle of the book, you're not sure just which one of the Blackwood sisters is off her rocker.  Which one of the sisters killed the rest of the Blackwood family, and why?  The sisters seem content to live in Blackwood Manor, even though the entire  town views them as freaks and murderesses, until cousin Charles shows up.  Then the fun really begins!<br />What makes this novel turly creepy is the  psychological disfunction of these two women.  There are no supernatural  influences here, as there were in _The Haunting of Hill House_; the  antagonist is a person who simply cannot live in the real world, and has to  create her own reality.<br />This novel is an especially good read for a  stormy night.  But be sure to finish it at one sitting, as it will be sure  to haunt you afterwards.	2000-06-10

This is the last of what critics refer to as Collins's &quot;apprentice novels&quot;, meaning that this is the last novel he wrote before he achieved fame with _The Woman in White_.  Many of the themes Collins used  in _The Woman in White_ seem to have been tested here, most notably the  question of the identity of a mysterious woman, but the themes of  legitimacy and secrecy play important parts as well.  Collins also has a  non-British character with a prominent part in this novel, but the German  Uncle Joseph is as endearing as the Italian Count Fosco is sinister.  Andrew Treverton and his servant, Shrowl, provide comic relief in a manner  similar to Frederick Fairlie -- they exhibit the type of antisocial  behavior that is irritating in real life, but is somehow rendered amusing  in print.<br />Unlike _The Woman in White_ or _The Moonstone_, there are no  real villains in this novel.  There are no intrigues to gain fortunes.  There is, however, a ghost.  Or is there?  The mystery of this novel is of  the commonplace variety; it is a question of a domestic secret rather than  that of a stolen Indian diamond or a woman's sanity.  Despite all of this,  the novel is still a page turner.  Even after the story became a bit  predictable, I couldn't put the book down until I knew for sure what  happened to Rosamond Frankland and Sarah Leeson.<br />As usual, Collins  has assembled an interesting bunch of characters:  the sea captain, the  actress, the misanthrope, the mysterious maid, and the young married  couple.  I found Sarah Leeson to be at once the most interesting and the  most sympathetic character.  This woman has obviously had a tragic past, a  past which torments her, and it is only at the novel's close that Collins  reveals what happened to destroy her happiness.<br />All-in-all, this is a  charming, fast-paced read that would be perfect for a lazy Saturday  afternoon.	2000-06-07

I expected it to have a lot of sadistic sex, and it did.  Soon, however, I got tired of the sadistic sex and  started looking for the plot.  After one-hundred and fifty pages, I was  still looking.  The characters here are all flat and stereotypical.  Sade  and his mother-in-law Marie are true to the historical accounts of them,  but other than the fact that they hate each other and like to inflict pain  on others, there wasn't really much to their characters.  I also have to  take issue with the description of Sade as attractive.  I've seen pictures  of him, and he was not at all good-looking.  Liliana Plissay, Sade's neice,  is a more interesting character, but there's not much more to her than the  good-vampire-who-wants-to-be-human-again stereotype, and there's not enough  of her story to drive the novel.  I did like the zombie vampires, though.  That was an interesting concept that I wish Mitchell had explored further.  To sum up, this book was so bad that I started to wonder if Mitchell  herself was a sadist, and this was her idea of a joke.  As I see that there  is now a sequel to this travesty of a vampire novel, I'm beginning to think  that explanation more and more likely.	2000-06-07

I say this not because the novel is bad -- it's actually quite good -- but because it was left unfinished; Dickens died while writing this novel.  I was prepared to be frustrated that I would never know how the mystery was  solved, but the novel ends before you really get to know what the mystery  is!  Edwin Drood disappears and is presumed dead, and Dickens makes it look  as if a certain person is guilty of his murder.  Of course, Dickens would  never have been so obvious, so it has to be a red herring. In addition to  the murder, a person who is obviously in disguise just barely appears on  the scene before the story abruptly ends, leaving no clue as to who this  person may be. The novel is well-written and intriguing, but without an  ending, it's a little frustrating!	2000-06-07

I don't know why I naively thought that &quot;Spyder&quot; was just a nickname, that there wasn't any  significance or special symbolism to it.  So when the spiders started to make their presence in the novel known, I  was unprepared, and as an arachnaphobe, pretty freaked out. I like being  disturbed, however, so this was not a bad thing.  I am particularly  impressed to learn that this is Kiernan's first novel -- her prose is so  polished, and her character's are for the most part well-rounded.  &quot;Silk&quot; reminded me a lot of Poppy Z. Brite's &quot;Lost  Souls,&quot;  but Kiernan's novel seems more accomplished, more like the  Poppy Brite of &quot;Exquisite Corpse.&quot;  The only down-side to the  novel is that some of the action isn't as clearly described as I would have  liked.  I won't give anything away, but I would have liked a clearer idea  of exactly what happened at the novel's climax.  This kept me from giving  the novel a full five stars, but I would have liked to give it 4.5, rather  than just four, as this lack of clarity was distracting, but the novel was  otherwise well-done. I know that when I see another novel by Caitlin  Kiernan, I'll have to pick it up. This woman has talent!	2000-05-19

No, it's not &quot;The Woman in White&quot; or even &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, but it's still an excellent story!  Collins has created another wonderful strong heroine, and this heroine is out to solve a  mystery.  Valeria Woodville's husband was tried for murder, and she is  determined to prove his innocence, once and for all.  During her  investigation, she meets Miserrimus Dexter, who is perhaps the most  fascinating character Collins has ever created.  He certainly makes Count  Fosco of &quot;The Woman in White&quot; look like a pussycat!  He's the  most enigmatic character -- just when you think you have him figured out,  you realize you don't know anything about him!  Ariel is another  fascinating character study.  She is worthy of pity, but pitying her is  like pitying a pit bull; she turns violent at the drop of a hairbrush.  Valeria herself is an interesting subject; she defies everyone, determined  to prove her husband's innocence, but towards the end of the novel, she  begins to behave a bit erratically.  I won't say any more; you'll have to  read the book to see what I mean.  This is a great novel to curl up with on  a rainy night, or maybe on a lazy summer Sunday afternoon -- sometime when  you won't be likely to be interrupted, as you won't want to put it down  until Valeria Woodville solves the mystery!	2000-05-19

Or, as Neil Gaiman writes in his introduction, the novel is &quot;a rich red wine, which may  come as a shock if all one has had so far has been cola.&quot;  This novel  must be savoured, not rapidly devoured, as I find myself doing with so many  contemporary science fiction and fantasy novels these days.  Dunsany truly  had a gift with words, and his descriptions, while seemingly vague, are  beautiful; he knew just how much to leave to the reader's imagination.  For  example, what exactly does the King of Elfland's throne room look like?  It  is &quot;the throne-room of which only song may tell.&quot;  That doesn't  say much, but at the same time, it says enough.  The tone of this novel  reminded me quite a bit of William Goldman's retelling of &quot;The  Princess Bride&quot; -- Dunsany's narrator reminds me of a father (or  grandfather, for those familiar with the film version) telling his son a  bedtime story, or of the village storyteller holding sway over a captive  audience.  I can already tell that this will be a story I will enjoy  sharing with my children, as it holds appeal for children of all ages, much  like Neil Gaiman's &quot;Stardust.&quot;  I am thankful to Del Rey for  bringing this novel back into print, and I look forward to reading more  from Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, Lord Dunsany.	2000-05-19

We've all felt the way Joy feels at some time or another.  The accuracy is so startling that  at times it's tempting to forget that this is fiction, and not a  non-fiction depression narrative, like &quot;The Beast&quot; or &quot;Girl,  Interrupted.&quot;  Perhaps this is why Galloway added the subtitle,  &quot;A Novel.&quot;  This novel is truly inspiring; it's refreshing to  read a novel about depression which maintains a sense of humor.  Galloway  uses a number of unusual narrative techniques, including spontaneously  breaking into dialogues when she's on the phone or talking to doctors, and  putting comments in the margins to represent the thoughts that we all have,  but don't always acknowledge, even to ourselves.  This is a novel I'm sure  I'll go back to again and again, because even though the subject matter is  depressing and painful, this novel is so beautifully written and the ending  is uplifting.  This novel will be with me for quite some time.	2000-05-19

I plan to use this book to teach my (someday) children the alphabet. This will also ensure that they grow up with the proper outlook on life. Edward Gorey will truly be missed!	2000-04-29

I've only read eight of Dickens's novels so far, but this is by far my favorite.  It's so very rich!  It did seem to take a bit longer to read than _Little Dorrit_ or _The Pickwick Papers_, but I think that may be  because the novel is so rich that it demands to be savoured rather than  devoured quickly. My favorite character?  Ah, that's a tough one, but I  think it has to be Lady Dedlock.  In addition to possessing a really great  name, she is a really tragic figure.  However, when Dickens first  introduces her into the narrative, it's a little difficult to be  sympathetic to her. I still felt a sympathetic connection to her; I don't  know why. Esther Summerson was a queer little bird.  Her need to make  everyone happy all the time--typical &quot;Angel in the House&quot;  behavior, I know--was a little grating at times.  I did like her though; I  wanted to see her happy at the end of the novel. I really like the way  Dickens structured this novel.  He alternated between a first-person  narrator, Esther Summerson, and a third-person point-of-view, with some  quite interesting results.  At any rate, if you're a fan of Dickens, then  this book is a must-read.  If you're not a fan of Dickens, then you've  probably only read _Great Expectations_, and that for a class!  I highly  recommend this novel as one of his best!	2000-04-27

I look forward to reading more Graham Joyce!	2000-04-27

This does not mean that it doesn't deserve five stars, because it was a five-star-read.  It just doesn't sparkle as much as  Gaiman's first novel.  I think one of the reviewers here mentioned that  this novel was written for young adults, which might explain why reading  this novel reminded me of reading Clive Barker's _The Thief of Always_.  Something about the tone of these two works is very similar; I can't quite  place my finger on what that similarity is, though. I did find the story to  be a bit too obvious at some points, but it was well-told at all points,  which more than makes up for it.  I would have liked a bit more development  of the brothers competing for the Stronghold; they disappeared before I was  done with them.  It would have been interesting to see their reactions to  the story's final developments.  All-in all, I was *very* satisfied with  the novel.  It was an exellent choice for the plane trip from Dallas to  Savannah.  Except for the strange looks I got from the other passengers  every time I laughed out loud.	2000-04-27

I have to disagree with those reviewers who claim that this book is not as good as Maguire's previous novel, _Wicked_.  This novel is just as good as its predecessor, but it's not as philosophical; it's more of a  pleasure-read.  That's not to say that _Confessions_ doesn't give you  anything to think about, but I think the difference here is that the nature  of beauty is something that we all think about, and discuss openly and  often, whereas wickedness and evil are something we try not to think about,  let alone discuss.  I think this is the reason that _Wicked_ seems to be so  much more powerful than _Confessions_. I found this novel to be  tremendously satisfying, and it will be difficult for me to wait until  Maguire writes another one.	2000-01-21

Young Thorfinn Ragnar takes occurences from his everyday life and from these common threads weaves beautiful stories in his imagination.  Of course, no one in  the real world realizes the importance of these dreams, or how gifted  Thorfinn is at weaving tales, and therefore he is dismissed as an  &quot;idle, useless boy.&quot; In the second half of the book, the story  takes place in the real world, abandoning the accounts of Thorfinn's  imaginary worlds, and it is here that the novel loses a bit of its charm.  The novel is still a beautifully-written novel, and I'm very glad I had the  chance to read it.	2000-01-21

This book has it all:  action, romance, intrigue, revenge, and an outlaw who's really not so bad after all. Although the book takes its title from the character of Rob Roy, you really don't meet him until two hundred pages  into the story...or do you?  Instead, the novel focuses on Francis  Osbaldistone, which may be a little disconcerting for those readers who  expect a rolicking adventure novel.  For me, the most interesting character  is that of Helen McGregor, Rob's wife.  She seemed to be a shrew who  controlled not only her husband, but the rest of the highlanders as well.  All in all, though, the novel is a wonderful read, perfect for a Sunday  afternoon.	2000-01-21
US	52760003	R247BI7WE1FN36	1862043132	933922174	In Search of the Woman Warrior: Four Mythical Archetypes for Modern Women	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Interesting, but these guys need a better editor!	The content of this book was interesting, but the thing that really stood out for me was the number of grammatical errors, particularly in subject-verb agreement and apostrophe use.  In some cases, the errors were  so egregious that I had to read the sentence two or three times to figure  out what the authors meant.  Everybody makes mistakes, but in the  publishing world, that's what editors are for!  I hope some of these  mistakes are caught before the paperback printing.<br />Complaint aside, I did  find the book rather interesting.  I learned a fair amount about feminine  figures in myth, history, and literature, although a majority of the  figures covered are pretty well-known to most people.  I also learned a bit  about myself, via the warrior-type quiz at the back of the book.<br />The  final thing I would like to note about this book is that the title is a bit  of a misnomer.  The authors spend almost as much time discussing male  warrior archetypes as they do female archetypes.  I understand that this is  necessary in order to create a precedent on which to build the female  archetypes, but then why is the warrior-type quiz and the chaper explaining  how to interpret your results written towards both men and women?  If the  authors expect men to benefit from this study as well as women, then maybe  they should change the title to reflect this.	2000-01-04

The essays approach the show from a wide variety of critical angles, which I found quite intriguing.  The only major problem I  had with the book is that although the writers had 49 episodes to derive  material from, they not only chose the same ten episodes to write about,  most of them used the same quotes from those episodes.  It's almost as if  the writers were given these quotes and told to use them in an essay.  The  best essays in the volume were Leslie Jones's &quot;'Last Week We Had an  Omen,'&quot; and Elizabeth Kubek's &quot;'You Only Expose Your  Father'&quot;(but perhaps I say that because they were the most helpful for  the paper I'm writing), but all of the essays were able to pique my  interest at some level.<br />I hope that someone undertakes a second volume  of _X-Files_ criticism soon, as some of the essays in this one are becoming  rapidly out-of-date, due to developments in the show.	1999-12-30

This novel is quite on par with _The Woman In White_, and I think I may even like this novel just a little bit more.  I particularly like the fact that in this novel, Collins lets the villain tell a large portion of the  story, making her a more sympathetic character than Count Fosco ever was.  Throughout the novel, you know full-well that Lydia Gwilt is a wicked woman  and that she is out to destroy Alan Armadale, but you can't help wishing  her success. (The fact that Alan Armadale is a complete jerk doesn't hurt  her case, either!)<br />Of course, the Most Sympathetic Character Award  doesn't go to Lydia; it goes to the ever-suffering Ozias Midwinter.  From  his birth, this poor guy never gets a chance to be happy, but you'll have  to read the book yourself to find out why not.<br />This book doesn't have the  humorous, tension-easing characters of _The Moonstone_ or _The Woman In  White_, but, as you might expect from Wilkie Collins, this book is  fast-paced, entertaining, and an amazingly good read!	1999-12-30

I myself was a bit disappointed with the book  initially.  HOWEVER, the book is very beautifully done, bringing together  Walker's original screenplay with Burton's pre-production sketches as well  as other production sketches.  The book gives the reader a visual depiction  of how the screenplay evolved into the film, which I found I quite  enjoy.<br />If you are a fan of Tim Burton, yes, this book is a must-have.  And if you approach it with the full knowledge that it is not your typical  behind-the-scenes guide to the film, and instead an homage to the artistic  endeavor that went into creating the film, I think you will enjoy this  book.	1999-12-28

It isn't that the book was at all bad; in fact, I  enjoyed it.  There seemed to be something missing.  The plot was a little  more transparent than that of &quot;Church.&quot;  In his previous novel, I  didn't know for sure whodunit until Dobyns chose to reveal the murderer to  the reader; in &quot;Boy,&quot; I had a pretty clear idea of what was going  on, and I was right.	1999-12-23

If Elphaba is &quot;the Wicked Witch of the West&quot;, then we have to question exactly what it means to be wicked.  This very question is something that  Elphaba wrestles with throughout the novel.  Perhaps  &quot;being wicked&quot; is only one way to explain the behavior of someone  we don't fully understand.  And perhaps those we label &quot;wicked&quot;  are those who don't make an effort to understand us.  This book gives you a  lot to think about, either way.	1999-06-28

Oliver Twist is more than just a great literary classic; it is also a gripping commentary on the state of social welfare and the problem of crime in Victorian England.  Through Oliver's experiences, the reader gets a first-hand look at the miserable existence of children in the &quot;charity houses&quot; and the desperate lives of criminals such as Fagin and the Artful Dodger.  This novel is a fine example of the genius of Charles Dickens:  he could cause his contemporaries to think about the world they lived in, while at the same time telling them an intriguing story that they could not wait to finish.  His stories are just as valuable today for the same reasons.	1998-04-16
