This book was a pleasure to read. Mr. Epperson writes in a clear and concise manner almost as if he is speaking with you directly. In this book he reviews the writings of Albert Pike and other Masonic writers to reveal the \\"hidden agenda\\" that is contained within. According to the masons, if you really want to know the \\"secret\\" all you have to do is look for it. That is what this book is all about, finding the hidden meanings in the Masonic writings and rituals. I didn't always agree with Mr. Epperson's interpretations of the writings but it was interesting to read nevertheless.	2005-04-25

Then the author spends way too much time on comets and asteriods. It seems that the earth/mars connection is that not only did Mars suffer a blast from a comet but that the same fate awaits earth and NASA and the government are covering it up so as not to alarm the people.	2005-04-25

The stories are quite interesting. Then attempts to teach you the method. The book makes it seem much harder then it is. I tried and tried but didn't get it until I took the course. Then everything came together for me. Advice I would give to people trying to learn the method is not to try so hard. It's easier they you think or then the book makes it seem. Just relax and tell yourself you will do it.	2005-04-25

Good sets out to prove that we are, and have been, visited by UFO's for a long long time. Using witness testimony and other evidence. He claims that the government has known about this since at least 1947 and is keeping it from the general population for their own agenda. A pretty interesting book. He covers UFO sightings from all over the world as well as here in North America. You can also tell from reading this book that the author has done a lot of research into this subject.	2005-04-25

The first chapter is filled with little known and fascinating facts about the moon. There are also chapters on crop circles, missing time, area 51 as well as the MJ-12 papers. This book was so interesting I could barely put it down (but I had to as it is a big book). I really loved reading this book and have read it twice now.	2005-04-25

The stories them selves are interesting but in between there is a lot of comments by the author that is frankly very boring to read. Mostly just her opinion about stuff, no real research was done. The author seems to hate UFO believers and ridicules them every chance she gets. This was an interesting book but because of the author inappropriate comments on ufoligists and the ufo field in general I will not buy another of her books. This book was called \\"Time Storms\\", not \\"I Don't Believe in UFO so nobody else should either\\"	2005-04-25

This book would be interesting to those who know nothing about UFO's, the occult or any paranormal subject. It is a collection of different stories ranging from Roswell to crop circles but it is all very basic. For anyone who has already read anything on any esoteric subject, this book will be very boring. It would make a good gift for someone who finds the paranormal interesting but knows nothing about anything paranormal.	2005-04-25

He has studied the ancient tablets the Sumarians left behind and according to him they reveal the long forgotten story of how we got here, who put us here and why. Mr. Sitchin goes into long drawn out translations of the tablets which includes the daily lives of the Sumarians themselves, how the Annunaki came here, where they are from and how they will be coming back.

Some little known stories and some well known ones. But in each case each story is told with the authors personal experience. Although some stories could have been researched more I recommend reading this book if you are at all interested in Atlantic mysteries. The stories don't just revolve around treasure but also mysteries.	2005-04-25

Alien intervention that is. The book makes a pretty convincing case too. I found this book to be a most interesting and enjoyable read. No boring parts, which I hate. There are also some very nice color photographs in the middle of the book. I also recommend Everything You Know is Wrong by Lloyd Pye in addition to this book.	2005-04-25

What is really interesting is that in the middle of the book there is a picture of some kind of big huge machine that was supposedly dug up by the military on US government property. It apparently has strange hieroglyphic like writing on it that is not known. Unfortunately the authors didn't do any other research into what this thing is or what happened to it. After some research on my part I wasn't able to find out anything more about it.	2005-04-25

In the first chapter the author recounts the stories of Ezekiel wheel and the Exodus from the bible and how they could have been UFO's. Then for the next several chapters the author tells his own stories of his paranormal experiences. Mostly ghosts, OBE's & NDE's. Although these stories were very interesting and I enjoyed them, that is not why I bought the book. The author however makes up for things near the end of the book, that is when things start to get interesting, very interesting. He talks about little known facts regarding the shroud of Turin and isolated people who will believe that anyone is god. He mentions the missing books of the bible and from the quotes he has listed it is easy to see why. This book was very easy to read and very hard to put down. I really enjoyed it, however I must warn you not to read this book if you don't have an open mind.	2005-04-25

This book has some interesting theories and stories but it's very technical. That part bored me rather quickly because I'm not a scientist so a lot of it was over my head. The parts that are not so technical...documented stories are VERY interesting and I'm glad I read the book just for those.

There are a lot of boring parts to this book interspersed with some fabulous information, which the author doesn't elaborate on at all and will force you to do your own research. Apparently the cross signifies the end of time but by the time you get to the end of the book you are scratching your head.The author doesn't know much about the actual cross or it's inscriptions...and apparently nobody does. The author has been researching this cross for 18 years but still doesn't know where it comes from. He links it to south America. Supposedly the cross tells when the world will end. Because there is aa etching of an angry sun on the cross so the author claims that the world will end by fire. The cross was made by an unknown alchemist/master mason..according to fucanelli.	2005-04-25

The authors provide detailed background research to most of the stories in the book. They leave out very famous mysterious places such as the pyramids or nazca lines but instead chose stories that are little known but yet mysterious all the same. That is not to say there are no famous mysterious places in this book. There are stories on Stonehenge & Easter Island but also little known stories such as Grimes Graves & Tintagel. I found this book to be most interesting and refreshing.	2005-04-25

I was most appreciative to receive it.  The frog is really soft and you can play around with it's eyes and mouth to make it happy or sad. It's very small so you can take it with you if you travel.

The first half of the book deals mainly with stone tools and the second half with ancient bones. There is a small chapter on other ancient anomalous artifacts that is quite interesting though. I found this book to be interesting although it goes into such detail to make some of it pretty boring. It's up to you how much background information you need or want to know. And if you need more information then is in this book try Forbidden Archeology. It's the same book with even more detail then this one. If that is possible.	2003-11-21

This book is about Planet X coming our way in the spring of 2003 (Of course it didn't show up). As it always has every 3600 years, it will cause major earth changes and 1/3 of the population will die. Although this book is not very well written, I do believe that the authors intentions are genuine. He really believes what he is saying and presents some powerful evidence that we are in for a world wide cataclysm. Depending on where you live and weather or not you have prepared, you may survive. Of course the government is keeping all this a secret from us while they build their underground bunkers so don't be thinking you can turn to them for help when you see the big red ball in the sky. This book is alright but there are more in-depth books out there on the subject of Planet X.	2003-11-21

Daniel Blair Stewart has explained on a few radio shows that he was in a Rosicrucian museum in California when he all of a sudden had an almost out of body experience. He saw everything that happened during Akhunaton's reign in Egypt. He published as fiction because he didn't want to have to prove what happened to him.

Bush is not the sharpest tool in the shed and I think we all know that, but he is certainly sneaky, conniving and out for himself. This well researched book tells just what a spoiled rich kid he is and how he is used to getting his own way no matter what the expense or who gets in the way. This book details his business failures, his drinking and drug problems including his arrest for cocaine . But not to worry, daddy took care of that little mess. The author and the publisher were even threatened with a lawsuit because George didn't want the truth to get out. The author was eventually killed...what a surprise.

Just when you start to get interested in a certain story...it's over! The author doesn't seem very curious about any of the stories as if he couldn't be bothered to do any research and just copied the story from somewhere else. Some of the stories are extremely interesting though and the book is worth buying just for that reason. You will want to mark certain pages for later research on your own though. But this book at least gives you a head start on some fascinating stories.	2003-11-21

I would not recommend this book to someone new to the subject of the search for the grail. The author assumes that the reader has already read Holy Blood, Holy Grail AND Holy Grail Across the Atlantic. The author spends most of the book analyzing Poussin's painting and the hidden geometric clues within. It gets way out there at times, but is an interesting theory. He, like Michael Bradley believes that the grail was brought to Nova Scotia by the knights templar and the main clues to the location are hidden within the painting. There are other clues throughout the Nova Scotia landscape and the Minas Basin, the location of the worlds highest tides. The Prince Henry Sinclair/Glooscap connection is mentioned as well as King Arthur and Dagobert. You can get lost easily if not paying attention but the footnotes are quite extensive and quite interesting. I must say I didn't enjoy this book as much as the other two I mentioned, but it did provide some interesting theories.	2003-11-21

This book tells the story of how the Knights Templar hooked up with Henry Sinclair in Scotland and how he brought them to Nova Scotia where they found Oak Island to be the perfect place to bury the treasure that disappeared from southern France along with about 13 Templar ships the night before their headquarters was raided by the kings men. He documents why they would have chosen this particular location and the efforts made over the years to excavate the &quot;Money Pit&quot; and why they have failed. I highly recommend this book if you are at all interested in the Templar's or buried treasure.	2003-11-21

Christopher Dunn tries to explain to the reader the technical aspects of the great pyramid and why it would be logical for it to be a power plant.

He was told by his commanding officer to &quot;see what you can do&quot; with the alien technology. He goes on to say how he set it up so that the technology would be fed to the public little by little so the public wouldn't suspect anything amiss.

Through over 10 years of research the authors claim that Jesus may not have died on the cross and actually made his way to southern France, where his bloodline continued. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Knights Templar, their secret and how it affects us today. If you can't handle an alternate view of history and how it may have been purposely kept from the general public, then don't read this book.	2003-11-21

Largely based on photos taken by NASA and the Russians, Childress attempts to show the reader why he believes there are ruins on the other plants in our solar system.

Ruins have been found that suggest &quot;someone&quot; was there before the settlers arrived. The book chronicles how this could be true and why they choose Nova Scotia. Also mentioned is Oak Island as a possible location of the holy grail. The book also raises the question if the grail was in Nova Scotia where is it now? Perhaps Montreal?

However you will be safe as long as you are a true believer. You will be safe from earthquakes if you sprinkle holy oil around your door. You will be able to drink the contaminated water as long as you put some drops of holy water in it. She even conveniently puts a form at the back of the book so you can buy all the holy things you are going to need to survive. The author's evidence is mainly from visionary's and the bible.

The biggest secret seems to be that the rich and powerful are plotting to take over the world. However according to Mr. Icke they are actually reptilian aliens, feeding off the evil emotions of the world. After you get past the hard to believe first part of the book, the rest is great. He tells a story similar to Jim Marrs in Rule by Secrecy, about how the elite are trying to bring about the new world order. He goes further however with the meanings behind some of the most recognizable logos in the world. I really enjoyed this book.	2003-11-21

Cooper doesn't always tell us where he got his information however this book is filled with photocopied government documents. If he faked them, then he sure went to a lot of trouble. Of course we will never know since he was shot last year by county sheriff deputies in a western style shoot-out. He always said he wanted to go down in a blaze of glory, I guess he did.	2003-11-21

I found this book very easy to read and hard to put down. Weather you agree with his theories or not it's obvious he's done a tremendous amount of research. If your are at all interested in ancient history mysteries you will enjoy this book. It's so well written I'm now getting his other books.	2003-08-27

The lessons are hard to follow and sometimes very confusing if you are not already familiar with Premiere. It's practically impossible to go through the tutorial from start to finish without getting totally lost. The book does have some useful information regarding compression and embedding so I gave it 2 stars instead of none. I know a lot of people liked this book and that is why I bought it, but I just don't think it is for a beginner. I started out not knowing anything about Premiere and video editing and I still know nothing.	2003-04-07

I couldn't put this book down. I highly recommend it if you are at all interested in mysteries.	2002-07-26

He leaves the reader guessing as to what might happen. It's not like he has a sequel coming out that answers all of the questions he leaves the reader with either. On the plus side it wasn't as boring as some of his other books and did keep me interested but I prefer stories with actual endings.	2002-07-26

The story is interesting but has a lot of boring parts to it. This book at least has a proper ending unlike some of the authors other work.	2002-07-26

The author makes no effort to explore these other worlds and leaves the reader wondering what happens in the end. I was like ancient archeology but I was disapointed with this book.	2002-07-26

During the first part of the book I kept falling asleep. It picks up a bit after that but by and large the book is a pretty boring read. I won't be reading the other books in the series.	2002-07-06
