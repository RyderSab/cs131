But as you read on, it becomes clear Balfour is writing a long love letter to his girlfriend, who introduced him to crossword puzzles. As he explains lucidly how he slowly began to understand the way the puzzles were put together, he slips in more and more details about his girlfriend. As you wonder whether they stayed together, you learn that she is pregnant with their first child. Time passes on, he gets better and better jobs, and suddenly she is giving birth to their third child. This is a wonderful piece of writing and one I cannot recommend highly enough.	2005-08-24

One irritation was the fact that the captions on some of the photos (one about a military man dying shortly after his wedding, another of a German fraternising with a Russian family, one female member of whom allegedly later tried to kill him) were not really followed up in the text. So the idea that this book gives new insights into the first 10 days of the war by quoting from personal papers of ordinary Soviet citizens isn't really borne out.	2005-07-26

The author delivers a scathing denunciation of what he sees as the cowardice and incompentence permeating the higher levels of the U.S. government, pouring scorn on the idea that there were no good experts on Afghanistan around in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. As he points out, the U.S. experience in the region (especially during the latter stages of the 1979-1992 Afghan war) meant the CIA and other intelligence/security organs contained a huge amount of knowledge about Afghanistan and what would be needed to ensure a successful campaign there. The author's message is that Bush and others decided they didn't need to do their homework before launching their attacks and therefore guaranteed long-term failure. By no means everyone will like the solution favoured by Anonymous -- kill several thousand Taleban and al-Qaeda fighters and sack the U.S. senior military staff too scared to tell the White House of the likely losses -- but his book does give the lie to the idea that no one in Washington had an idea of how to tackle the Afghan problem.	2005-07-26

Instead, the regime employed hundreds of economists, demographic experts and the like who studied every aspect of life in eastern and south-eastern Europe to see how these regions could be made more efficient under German rule. Whether it was central Poland or Bulgaria, the findings were the same -- there were too many unproductive people (or \\"dead ballast\\") around and something would have to be done to get rid of them. Once the Germans had come to this conclusion, the idea of exterminating the Jews gained ground irresistibly and you get the clear impression from the book that this had just as much to do with economic realities as it did with racist theories. What is also interesting is the fight between Berlin and the German rulers of the Government-General (the large chunk of central Poland), who took it into their heads to make their part of the world an economically productive unit rather than acting as a dumping ground for the unwanted from central Europe. And what is depressing is the fact that so many of these experts who produced reports about the need to eliminate \\"useless mouths\\" prospered after the war, many of them attaining important positions rather than being put up against a wall or slapped in prison for decades. For anyone really interested in exactly how the Holocaust came about, this is a crucial read.	2004-09-11

This barely figures in the book and it is misleading to sell it as part of mainstream Holocaust literature. Hoettl occupied an important role in the German espionnage unit responsible for south-eastern Europe and does a superb job (this book was first published in 1953) outlining the chaos the Nazis were faced with in Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and the like and how their often bone-headed decisions only made matters worse. What I found particularly interesting were his observations on the brutal behaviour of the Croats and the Serbs, which helped explain the course of the war in the early 1990s, as well as the translation of the self-incriminatory and often downright depressed notebook which Mussolini wrote after the Italian government put him in detention in 1943. After Mussolini was rescued by German commandoes, the contents of the notebook fell into Hoettl's hands. This is a must-read book for anyone wanting more details as to what the Germans were up to in south-eastern Europe in the last war.	2004-08-18

The writing style is simple yet evocative and we quickly move from the author's training days to the moment when he first meets an enemy plane in combat. What I particularly appreciated about the book was the focus on Anderson's family and the stresses they suffered and the continual reference to the brutality of war and the number of the author's flying colleagues who died. The World War Two reminiscences end about two-thirds of the way through the book and then we have to wade through perhaps too much about his post-war experiences as a test pilot, a desk-bound bureaucrat and then a commander in the Vietnam war. But do buy the book for the World Wat Two material alone, which is excellent.	2004-08-18

The very premise of the book -- woman advertises for sexual partners to quickly help break decades of self-imposed celibacy -- to me at least shows clearly that her prospective partners are little more than lumps of meat and this is how the book turns out. Yes, she does feel more fond of some lovers than others, and she shows us how clearly she appreciates deep intellectual conversations, but at the end of the book I can't help thinking that despite putting all these various males under the microscope, she doesn't have much luck finding out what makes them tick. For me the highlight of the book was the passages on her teaching career and what makes a good teacher, in part because it was the one time when she showed real emotion and passion about the topic at hand.	2004-08-06

The answer is a great deal. Taubman has done a wonderful job of using old and new archives to paint the gripping picture of a devious, suspicious, ill-educated yet extraordinarily canny man who survived the purges and then went on to become Soviet leader. What I found most illuminating was quite how short-tempered Khrushchev was most of the time and how staggeringly incompetent he and his fellow leaders were. It's amazing how the world wasn't plunged into a nuclear war when the Soviet Union was in the hands of such a bunch of nitwits. This is the best political biography I've read in years.	2003-09-16

The website is very quick to produce hysterically funny material, focussing on the events of the day and skewering the rogues who need to be skewered. And that is part of the problem with this book -- much of the material is pretty old and refers back to events that no one really remembers that well and therefore do not resonate. The jokes have no immediacy. I read much of the book and thought \\"This I'm sure was funny then, but it sure falls flat now\\". The buzzwords and fads of the boom-times in the 1990s are just vague memories now and have very much lost their bite. So while I'll continue to log on to the website, I'm going to give away this book.	2002-07-19

Toby Young, who has an unerring ability to focus on his own shortcomings, does an excellent job of explaining exactly how not to get on in New York. His waggish personality, a healthy appetite for drink and a large stock of off-colour jokes -- all attributes which would serve you well as a journalist in London -- ensure he makes a total mess of pretty much everything he does in Manhattan, the mothership of all that is politically correct in the United States. Indeed, when Vanity Fair boss Graydon Carter fires Young, he tells our hapless hero that he has a brown thumb. \\"Everything you touch turns to ****,\\" he explains with a laugh. Young is the squarest of pegs in a world where all the holes are round and to make matters worse, a friend of his who went to Los Angeles at the same time strikes immediate and lucrative success. Young is also very funny about his total lack of success with American women, largely because they quickly realise he is broke (and has quite a few complexes, as well as an impressively large collection of appalling pick-up lines). Two-thirds of the way through, the book suddenly becomes more serious as Young realises he has hit rock bottom and starts groping for a way out. To say much more would give too much away but it's well worth sticking through to the end.	2002-07-13

There is no bibliography in this work, which means the reader has little chance of discovering where else Whiting did his digging and what is unique and what is not. This is not so much a book about Heydrich as a highly disjointed and padded second-hand account of all the things Heydrich might (or might not) have been involved in, seen through the eyes of others. Never once do we get inside the man's soul and Whiting's alleged main triumph -- his interview with Heydrich's widow many years after the war -- falls totally flat, since she didn't really tell him anything very interesting. Whiting also hammers away at his rather odd and underdeveloped pet theory that Heydrich's efforts to pull all of Europe's industry under German control successfully paved the way for the fledgling European Community (later the European Union) which was created after the war. If you want to know anything serious about Heydrich and the way he worked, read Schellenberg's book, not this one. What really does surprise me is how few serious books are readily available on Heydrich, who after all was one of the most interesting and intriguing of Hitler's lieutenants, the man who played a key role in finalising the plans for the Final Solution and amassed extraordinary power before his assassination.	2002-03-16

The author has certainly done an impressive amount of research and this shines through clearly in a compelling account. He is lucky that the U-boat captain he focuses the tale on was one of the very few to survive the war and could therefore recount his experiences at leisure, but this does not detract at all from a book which shows how U.S. incompetence and arrogance in the face of a clear threat they'd been warned about almost cost the Allies the war.	2001-08-31

After absorbing the pre-publication hype I was convinced this would be a rollicking no-holds barred examination of the depths Tina Brown and Harry Evans had sunk to during their years in America. It strikes me that this was the pitch the author made to the publisher but it doesn't work, for a number of reasons. As you get deeper into the book the author makes clear that whatever their personal foibles, these were in fact two very gifted people. Yes, their habits and methods were not to everyone's liking, but jeepers! Are we supposed to be surprised that a highly-strung editor of two top magazines sometimes wasn't very nice to people? This is New York, for heaven's sake. The book is surprisingly balanced in its assessment of Tina Brown and yet the author, perhaps feeling a little guilty that the portrayal isn't sharp or controversial enough, resorts to some pretty insulting copy. Do we really want to know that Tina once put on make-up badly or once turned up to a meeting with unshaven legs? Come off it. This is part of the overall problem with this work, which has clearly been put together in a hurry. It certainly needed a better editor. Within a few pages at the start at least two anecdotes are repeated verbatim and the concluding section is a real mess, just a collection of thoughts thrown down on the paper. So reader beware -- although in places this is a very interesting book, it's not the one the publicists would have you believe it to be.	2001-08-06

The heart of the book consists of around 200 secret  Communist Party documents interspersed with commentary from the authors.  The archival material suggests very strongly that the path to the terror  was not planned meticulously from the start but consisted of a series of  false starts and zigzags until Stalin decided in 1937 to crush all  resistance to the party's rule. Of particular interest are a couple of  documents which show how many members of the inner Politburo demanded  stricter punishments for alleged wrong-doers than Stalin did himself.  Barring the discovery of Stalin's diary many of the dictator's motives will  remain unknown forever but the documents in this book do paint a largely  convincing portrait of an unpopular regime in Moscow lurching from crisis  to crisis, trying both to stablise the internal situation and also to  eliminate the possibility of serious internal resistance. What does come  through very clearly is how arbitrary the terror was and how many of those  charged with repressing alleged foreign spies and saboteurs were almost  guaranteed to be shot themselves. First the Politburo lashed out at the  secret police for not doing enough to stamp out centres of Trotskyite  resistance and then issued orders demanding the execution and arrest of  millions of people across the country. Later the secret police came under  fire for allegedly indulging in indiscriminate terror and repressing too  many people.     I can understand the point of the Kirkus Reviews  contributor who doubted the authors' explanation that the Politburo pushed  ahead with the purges because they were indeed convinced  enemies lay  behind every corner and a coup was always possible. A sense of  self-preservation and the need to show Stalin they were onside surely did  partly explain their enthusiasm for spilling blood. But this is a minor  quibble about an otherwise excellent book.	2000-07-11

Andrews  writes clearly and forcefully in a manner which overcomes  the deadening  effects of the acronyms scattered across each page. But for those who  familiar with the KGB and its role abroad, this is surprisingly thin fare.  Andrews quotes from a huge number of books and other texts, mentioning  Mitrokhin in passing when his archive can add to our knowledge of a  particular episode. Apart from revealing the existence of the so-called  &quot;granny spy&quot; Melita Norwood and some interesting material on what  the KGB was up to in Poland in the 1970s and 1980s, there is not much new  here.

Soviet Public Culture from Revolution to Cold War	Books	4	24	24	N	Y	Turgid writing style mars what should have been great book	Although this book provides a valuable insight into the dark heart of Stalinism it is marred by an exceedingly odd mixture of writing styles. In part it feels like a turgid academic thesis packed with sentences so  convoluted that they don't make sense however many times you read them. But  elsewhere Brooks shakes off the leaden prose and delivers just what I  expected from the blurb -- an incise study of how Stalinism developed  through the eyes of the media. There is a great deal of interesting  material here and Brooks has obviously done a huge amount of research. He  shows how Stalin gradually throttled the life out of the media and turned  newspapers and magazines into codebooks for the Soviet elite, packed with  dead language and curious ideas which were of crucial importance to those  jostling madly for influence and of no interest or value to the general  population. But every time I felt like giving the book the five stars it  should have merited, I came across a passage like the following: &quot;In a  play, actors and audience briefly leave the quotidian world to enter a  special arena of time and space. To describe this realm of the 'betwixt and  between' in which wishes or dreams hold sway, one can employ the concept of  'liminal', that is, a threshold between sacred and profane, a transitional  zone that participants in a ritual must enter in order to leave the  everyday world. Arnold van Gennep, who introduced the notion in his classic  1908 study, The Rites of Passage, postulated three phrases of ritual  drama...&quot; I shall spare you the no less impenetrable thoughts of van  Gennep. Brooks also has a weakness for the word 'Manicheanism' which  appears far too often in this text. I write these words of criticism with a  heavy heart, because inside the verbiage there is a very good book waiting  to break out. Brooks has done enough to ensure that every half-serious  student of Stalinism will have to buy this book, but I only wish he had  found an editor able to strip away the excess words.	2000-07-05

Using a wealth of sources, she shows with particular  clarity the great incompetence of the bureaucracy, where everyone seemed  more interested in fighting for influence than in serving the people. She  also puts the focus on crime, hooliganism and how the lot of women was  slowly improved through the chance to get a decent education. Fitzpatrick  also does not disappoint with the crushing effect of the nightmare years of  1936-1938, when millions were executed or imprisoned during the Great  Purge.

Tolkien: A Biography	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Bland, uninformative, dull	Carpenter tries hard and covers all the bases, but the book gives us very little idea what exactly made Tolkien tick and what he was trying to say with Lord of the Rings, especially the powerful concluding chapters. This  was a disappointment	2000-01-07

Nash does a superb  job of explaining how the paranoid and mercurial Canadian Prime Minister  John Diefenbaker and John Kennedy rapidly developed a mutual antipathy  which indirectly prompted senior U.S. bureaucrats to do their best to  overthrow the democratically-elected leader of a neighbouring state. Nash  is particularly good on the character of Diefenbaker and has managed to  talk to most of the supporting casts on both sides.	2000-01-07

Marks' tale is that of a smug young man, supremely confident in his own  abilities and intelligence, who has to battle his staid hidebound bosses as  he struggles to equip secret agents with more effective ways of sending  messages from the field. There are moments of great sadness, when we meet  agents who -- thanks to incompetence and complacency at the highest levels  -- are almost certain to be captured, tortured and executed. Marks is also  particularly good on the Germans' successful penetration of the Allies'  spying operations in the Netherlands. But he cannot resist telling us how  wonderful he is and the childish attempts at humour really start to drag as  the reader ploughs on. I agree with a previous reviewer who said this book  should have been edited much more thoroughly	2000-01-07

I remember reading the exceptionally gritty and (to me) utterly realistic Comrades of War many years ago and marvelling at how the author had survived his time in a German penal battalion while his colleagues were  being killed off methodically. Now I discover to my great surprise that  Sven Hassel may in fact not have been who he said he was. If you go to  Hotbot and do a search for his name you'll find an intriguing site where a  Danish journalist claims to have amassed evidence that Hassel was the  pseudonym for a Dane who joined the Gestapo and was initially sentenced to  death after the war. The translation is a bit ropey but it makes for some  very interesting reading. It's hard to tell how much of it is accurate, but  at first glance it would appear that Mr Hassel has some awkward questions  to answer. This doesn't detract from the powerful tale that is Comrades of  War, as long as you treat it as fiction rather than biography.	2000-01-04

The author is also  good on how the Germans picked up the pieces and made a much more  professional attempt to manage the country before their efforts also  soured. There are on occasion too many Albanian surnames littering the text  but don't let this put you off. If you have any interest in Albanian  history, this is the book for you.	1999-12-31

I knew nothing of Stan Fischler before I started Cracked Ice and  finished the book knowing far more than I coud ever have wanted. This is  &quot;me journalism&quot; at its worst -- do we really need to be told time  and time again at great length how he prepared for a TV interview, where he  stood in some building waiting to catch an NHL bigwig and how much he, Stan  Fischler, is respected in the game? Half way through the book I found  myself muttering &quot;Shut up already&quot;. The only exception to the  self-serving litany is a powerful chapter detailing the severe heart  problems which strike down Fischler's teenage son and the warm-hearted  reaction from friends (and adversaries)in the game. But I cannot believe  the publishers could not have found an editor capable of whipping this  overblown diary, this notebook, into something resembling a decent product.  The book focusses largely on the overthrow of former NHL supremo John  Ziegler and the travails of the New York Islanders and the New Jersey  Devils. If like me you wanted some insight into why the Quebec Nordiques  and Winnipeg Jets moved south, you're out of luck again. What is most  frustrating about Cracked Ice is that Fischler obviously does have the  contacts within the game and has a huge amount of knowledge. When he  resists the urge to tell you how wonderful he is, the author comes up with  the goods and gives us real insights into the dirty deals, botched PR  exercises and the other ailments of the game. I only wish this book had  come with a warning about Fischler's oversized ego.	1999-12-29

The answer is pretty much everything. Dryden, who writes in a delightfully unhurried  style, takes us through the game as it is played by enthusiastic amateurs,  by teenagers desperate to break into the NHL and by the professionals  themselves. And by probing how hockey took root here, Dryden provides the  best analysis of what it means to be Canadian that I have ever read. My job  in Ottawa is to explain Canada to the outside world and of all the tomes I  have read so far, this must be the most illuminating. Rarely do you come  across a book which so clearly explains what fires the soul of a  country.  Buy it now!	1999-12-29

I'm only glad I read someone else's copy and didn't pay out my own money for this drivel. How do books this bad get published?  Wafer-thin characters, disastrously ill-conceived plot, and yet it makes  the bestseller lists. Or so we're told. I understand the author has a new  book out -- I for one will not be reading it.	1999-12-29

The author manages to take the reader through the entire war without once managing to make the action exciting enough for us  to care what happens to him. &quot;I got up, got into the plane, got to  fighting altitude, got a German in my sights and got a few shots off at  him,&quot; is about as thrilling as it gets. This book is just awful -- so  much potential and such a pathetic end result.	1999-12-15
