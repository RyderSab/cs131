Though her exploits were laughably over the top it's ANDREA that really shocked and appalled me.  Why did she think it fine to rip off the company for personal expenses?  Why did she think it was cute to tip a hundred dollar meal into the trash and throw away china, silver, and accessories away as well?  Why did she feel obliged to wipe greasy hands all over her boss's expensive clothes?  All of these petty little acts just turned my stomach. <br /> <br />She was the real monster of the book as far as I'm concerned.  If she hated her job and those around her so much she should have quit.  I found nothing admirable about her or her high horse.	2005-09-26

Aisling is delivering an object, someone tries to steal it, twice.  People start getting dead, she is blamed, and must be the one to solve the crimes, OR ELSE!  She's NOT the dragon's mate but does him a few times anyway....wait, which book AM I reading? <br /> <br />The mystery here is why I have read two of these dreadful books. Thank God for libraries so I'm just wasting time and not my money.  Aisling is still irritating, immature, and an idiot waiting to make a mess happen.  I have no idea why Drake wants her, there isn't a single bit of honest dialog between them that would indicate a growing understanding of each other.  They just have this inexplicable desire to have firey sex since she was MADE JUST FOR HIM.  Otherwise I have no doubt he would give her the boot since she is entirely more trouble than she's worth. <br /> <br />And then there is Drake's big \\"betrayal.\\"   Just a plot device to leave the lovers in a cliffhanger for the next book.	2005-09-04

I don't see it.  Speaking of \\"it?\\"  That was one of the most ridiculous things she did in the book.  There is a demon named Jim in the book, ok?  This demon appears in the form of a large, black, male, Newfoundland.  Which is a dog.  But she refers to this dog as \\"it.\\"  Giving us such pearls of grammar as this:  \\"Jim's eyes almost bugged out of it's head.\\"  Or this:  \\"Jim flung itself on him.\\"  Over and over she constructs sentences so that she can flaunt what she obviously thinks it a cute plot device but instead it's just irritating.  However, the dog is about the only interesting character in the book.  Except she threatens to castrate him every, excuse me, castrate \\"it\\" every twenty seconds and that gets even older than the misused \\"it.\\" <br /> <br />And then there is Aisling.  I guess she is supposed to be a lovable madcap along the lines of Lucille Ball.  Messes up everything she touches but you just gotta love her anyway.  But there is nothing lovable about Aisling.  She just comes off as stupid and clueless. <br /> <br />And romance?  Well, she clobbers the hero in the nose, giving him a nosebleed, and that causes such instant lust in the both of them that they go into the next room and have at it against the wall.  While a club full of people listen in the near vicinity.  Be still my beating heart.  <br /> <br />The book tries so hard to be clever that it's as embarrassing as the girl who tries too hard to be liked by everyone.  Why I read the whole thing I have no idea.  I guess I thought something in the book had to be best seller worthy and I didn't want to miss it.  I must have missed it. <br /> <br />	2005-09-03

Up to that point I had a bit of sympathy for her but she has no one to blame but herself for what she does to her baby.  I had no sympathy for her from this point on at all. <br /> <br />I can't believe I read the whole dismal book, something in common with those train wrecks you can't quite turn away from.

What a testament to Ms. Robb's creativity.  And this one is truly one of the best.  I can't give away too much but I have to say that I was so afraid during the middle of the book that  hardass Eve would make the wrong decision about how the case should end up.  But she didn't and I find it so great that she could do the right thing for all involved.  The book really makes you do a lot of thinking about the ethics involved in being the \\"best you can be.\\" <br /> <br />I did have a few moments of cringe in how  badly Eve treated Mira.  I didn't think Mira deserved that kind of disrespect but that's our Eve.  Rough Edges R Us.  I do expect the love of Roarke, Peabody, Mira, Nadine and crew, woops, forgot the wonderful Mavis! to eventually soften Eve up and allow her to be more giving and loving to those who love her, I guess it wouldn't be realistic if it happened too quickly.  Afterall, she and Roarke have only been married for a little over a year.  And at least she is now telling Roarke freely that she loves him and missed him while he was gone.  This is a big deal for our cop! <br /> <br />  But it wouldn't kill her to relax and enjoy a good massage, facial, and girly night once in a while.  She has to keep up with the gorgeous Roarke.  Enough with the whinging about female upkeep!  And Mavis is STILL pregant!  This pregnancy is running soap opera length!	2005-08-29

Usually their books are roller coaster rides but this one is just, oh how I hate to say this, but it's just a little boring.  All of the usual suspects are on board but they don't interact with each other, they are all off on their own little tangents.  I would have enjoyed the book more if they'd all been allowed to conspire together to help Pendergast.  Instead each is not telling the other about the problem to try to protect each other.  Ho hum. <br /> <br />Pendergast is confounded here by his almost too worthy of a foe brother.  Diogenes is clearly Pendergast's superior.  After seeing him in action I doubt Pendergast's ability to defeat him.  I'm certain he will accomplish that in some future book, how convincing the authors can be in bringing that about we'll just have to see. <br /> <br />And even though this book was a bit of a drudge to get through I am still eager for the next installment.	2005-08-06

I don't know many of the stars in the book but still found their knitting stories warming as they captured the essence of what knitting means to those addicted to it.  And though the patterns are simple it shows what amazing beauty can easily be created with the wonderful yarns we have today.  While I wouldn't have paid $25.00 for it, I find I can't resist it at Amazon's half price offering.  I'm gathering up all kinds of different yarn at the moment to make Daryl Hannah's beautiful scarf.  Mine will be black and whites. <br /> <br />And then I want to make Nora's scarf.  Then that quirky pink and red one by Bridget.  Using the pocket as a hat?  My daughter will love it!  I already have just the right yarn to make Julianna's......I love so many of the patterns I will definitely be getting my money's worth.  The stitches are the easiest ones in knitting but the way the colors and yarn combinations are arranged adds all the style and creativity you could ask for.  <br /> <br />Yes, the patterns are definitely beginner fare but there is a beautiful spirit in this book and that's also what I am buying.	2005-07-21

I don't think it was necessary for her character to disappear like that.  If she wanted to leave her husband she could have left a note that she felt endangered and was disappearing, some kind of note to keep the police from wasting years of manpower looking for her.  She would have been just as safe, maybe even safer without her picture being all over the news and papers. <br /> <br />It was no small thing to me that the detective, Patrick, had his marriage ruined because of his obsession with Mara's disappearance.  All that could have been avoided, but it seems Mara didn't care what the fate was of those left behind, just as long as she and her baby were safe. <br /> <br />It rather ruined the book for me.	2005-06-24

Even writing a book I find to be deeply flawed, her rich voice and prose pushes that rating on up there despite so many questions left hanging. <br /> <br />The biggest one?  That the old woman looks at her hand and gives the spooky pronoucement:  He's coming.  Who came?  No one that I can see, surely she's not talking about the few abortive dates with Tom. <br /> <br />Then there is the mystery of why her new friend Matthew will allow his girlfriend to be so rude in throwing Betta out of the room she's rented.  This is Betta's friend?  That was extremely annoying and then we never find out what came of their little plot to make the girlfriend jealous.  Hmmmm. <br /> <br />I guess Ms. Berg was showing us how erratic widowhood makes a woman but so many actions by Betta are inexplicable.  The worst being the screeching she did at her friend Lorraine after she simply does what Betta asks her to do. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the book despite the lack of reality of many events, but the ending was rushed and way too abrupt.  Perhaps because there will be a sequel?  I would love to learn more about her three old/new friends. (I chose to overlook the implausibility of their coming running after 30 years of silence from Betta.)  The store sounds like such a wonderful place and I wanted to hear more about all the merchandise.  But the ending has Betta spinning into a bunch of erratic behavior then the book is over just like that. <br /> <br />Very unsatisfying unless there is a sequel.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-18

The \\"hero\\" was so hateful and treated her so bad that even though I knew the romance was coming I had a really hard time accepting him.  The things he said and did to her were too over the line for me to backtrack to sweet nothings later.  Actually there weren't any sweet nothings.  He was a jerk to the very end. <br /> <br />It is a testament to Ms. Robards writing style that I kept reading this book even though I found the hero not living up to that title at any point.  I guess some women love that kind of rough and angry man but he didn't give me shivers at all. <br /> <br />And I really had a difficult time with him calling her a b*tch every time she dared to try to escape from the very probable rape and murder he threatened her with constantly.  The very nerve of the heroine for trying to protect herself.

I am a long time fan of Ms. Hamilton and go here on record saying she is one of the most creative writers I've ever read.  But I have never in all my reading history watched a writer more thoroughly and contemptuously destroy a loyal fan base.  There is no doubt that the Anitaverse is hers to do with as she pleases but the changes she forced on Anita from NIC onwards are unbelievable.  No wonder Anita fought so hard to stay free of JC, once that line was crossed the slope became slippery indeed!  And we won't even go into what is now lubricating said slope. <br /> <br />I'm not one of the fans that is screaming about the addition of sex to the monster hunting and the mystery.  I never thought Anita should settle down with just one guy and raise kiddies.  Her powers made her extraordinary and I wouldn't have had a problem with her being in the triumverate and loving both her men in all kinds of kinky ways.  I figured Richard would putz around for a while and then come on board.  He's not going to get a picket fence life either, so deal Richard!  There had been a lot of wonderful sexual tension building for many books and it had to come out sometime.  I was looking forward to Anita loosening up and exploring the possibilities of the TRI. <br /> <br />But then we have the ARDEUR.  It it supposed to be blamed for our chaste, modest, uncomfortable-with-nudity Anita being OK with not only sex with everyone she knows (while her friends watch), but stunt sex with JC's new vamps (while her friends watch), and then finally sex on stage at his strip club (while strangers watch).  Come on, this character would never go for it.  THAT'S why the fans are screaming.  Not because of the addition of sex, but so much sex and in so many ways that Anita couldn't live with on her best day. All I could think of while reading this book was what would Edward think if he could see the Anita he loves and respects being passed around like this?  <br /> <br />I love the books and watching thisprogression is painful.  With ID coming out I spent the week prior to its debut re-reading all my old books, so I tore into INCUBUS DREAMS with much anticipation.  By the time I finished I had that clean white space in my head that Anita visits when she kills someone.    This is one book in the series that I won't be re-reading over and over.  It's just too exhausting.  <br /> <br />The book does address lots of relationship issues.  It's wonderful that Richard and Anita both grew and came to realize that signing into the TRI had to be faced and accepted in all it's glorious power.  Unfortunately that scene was a bit of an anti-climax since Anita accidently formed a new TRI with Nat and Damian.  Why, Laurell?  Why add that mess when Anita can't even cope with the TRI she already has?  ID will go down as the book that is just too much of everything.  (Except a mystery)  Fine, we needed to have a bunch of different character heart to hearts.  That done and done well, can this series be saved? <br /> <br />Yes, it can.  Just stick a cork in ...ahem, the ardeur.  Anita is the big tough vampire slayer, she can get control of it and severely reduce the queue waiting to sample her favors.  Then she, JC, and Richard can use all that wonderful power they've summoned up to go fight evil in all its forms.  Please.  Please.  Please.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-05

But I bought THIS book expecting to get a short story about my favorite characters. A short story has a beginning, a middle, and an END. Nowhere on this book does it say one word about her offering being an excerpt from the upcoming Incubus Dreams. Her story is called &quot;Blood Upon My Lips&quot; and is presented in a short story anthology, but it isn't a short story at all. I think that is a gross misrepresentation and dirty pool on Ms. Hamilton's part. If she wanted to advertise for her newest novel that's fine, but we should have been able to make an informed choice before spending eight bucks. Instead we are just left hanging and got as little satisfaction from our encounter with Anita, Nathaniel, and Damian as they did.<br /><br /> Hopefully, the other stories will make up for being rooked by LKH.

Anytime you read Mr. Child you really have to work overtime to keep your disbelief under wraps.  In his last novel he had the FBI breaking laws right and left and treating Reacher like he was a puppet at their mercy.  This time it's the Secret Service but they treat Jack like he's the Second Coming and can't seem to come up with an idea or a move unless he suggests it.  I mean they are hanging onto his every word.  It's well known that neither of these organizations would happily work with civilians anyway but that's where that willing suspension of disbelief comes in.  We want Jack to be appreciated by these people so we'll go along with them using his great talents.   <br /> <br />But then there are such CLUNKERS that you get knocked right out of storyland and start shaking your head in wonder that Mr. Child makes such lame mistakes or that his editor doesn't catch them.  For instance:  Reacher is quite pleased that he wanders around the country with neither driver's license nor I.D.  Yet he picks up a wad of cash at Western Union.  Sorry folks, no I.D., no getting the moolah.  Elementary.  <br /> <br />And then we have the assassination attempt.  The Secret Service boss calls one of their researchers to come in immediately.  Anyone doubt that the researcher would be heading in immediately?  Nope, he whines that he needs at least two more hours at his Thanksgiving dinner. Excuse me?  Our V.P. has been shot at and two agents are dead, but this guy is going to continue eating turkey?  Yeah, that was a turkey all right.  Then the boss also says agents will be thin around there because he has given them 24 hours off and he's not calling them back in because the V.P. can't sleep.  CLUNK!  Can we suspend our disbelief that any agent would be taking off the day an assassination is foiled?  I think not.  I can't list any of the other clunkers without giving away too much of the action but there are far too many from such a talented writer.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I keep reading his books because I really like Reacher.  The business of him throwing away good clothes is getting a little old though but at least he wore clean clothes every day in this one.  And his new sidekick was quite interesting and here's hoping we see her again in the future.  <br /> <br />	2004-07-28

Hello CNN? I don't think that's going to be happening in America. Not to mention them standing around watching as Reacher beat up a couple of hoods while under surveillance. I'm sure that broke a few laws too. Pull the other leg please.        And then we have the MO. Please. I doubt that scenario could be pulled off once much less four times. And I have no doubt whatsoever that it couldn't be accomplished without the victim thrashing around and getting paint on the floor. Certainly wouldn't be a quite, peaceful death.        And if Jack doesn't start changing his clothes and practicing some better hygiene all his women are going to be singing is Hit the Road, Jack.......    OK, I'll have to say that even with one preposterous thing after another I still read every word.  Mr. Child is a talented writer and I look forward to continuing improvement as he puts Jack through his paces.  Maybe I should have given this one three stars afterall.	2004-07-26

I just made my way through all the Prey novels and enjoyed them so much that I went back to his early Kidd novels too.  These are such wonderful characters I can only hope that there will now be just as many Kidd adventures as Davenport's.  This one will go on my keeper shelf.  Sure, much has changed in the computer world now but it doesn't interfere with the story at all.  I can't wait to work my way to the Hangman now!<br /><br />More Kidd and LuEllen please!!	2004-07-26

Sandford's an excellent writer so that aspect of his story telling is never in question but Lucas is phoning it in on this one. Will he listen to Weather and start building Big New Houses? I sure hope not. Nor do I really want Sandford to get rid of Lucas' new family happiness so he can have &quot;edge&quot; again. (However, wouldn't some rolling around in the sheets between Lucas and the horny Russian have been lovely? Lucas could have made her so happy if he was still single, dangit.) I don't think I could like him if he was out cheating on his new wife and baby son, but something has to be done. Lucas is way too young to be put out to pasture. Here's hoping that Mr. Sandford can regain enthusiasm in him and for him. The Porsche driving Davenport is one of the Greats. Too many TV shows have died off after the main character gets married. Hoping this isn't Davenport's fate. Who really likes Weather anyway? <br />  <br /> By the way, the best scenes in the whole book are Weather driving through the garage door and the cat fight in the restaurant. Hilarious.	2004-07-21

In The Program, Alan Gregory has only a bit part this time but never has he been more lame.  The main character, Peyton, is in the Witness Protection program because she has people wanting her and her daughter dead.  Now they're missing, her house is in shambles, blood is present on the scene and Alan is once again whining about how he can't breech confidence unless he knows she's in imminent danger.  Duh, Alan, what did the nice marshall just tell you about her house?  He says that the front window is busted out, her bedroom furniture is all over the place and there is blood.  Too bad, Alan the Righteous is still not talking!  And I kid you not this is what Alan says:<br />&quot;Let's both of us pray that she met a guy and that her daugher's at a friend's house at a sleepover.<br />I kid you not.  Would someone please shoot Alan and put him out of his misery?  Actually about the only character in this book that has enough sense to come in out of a hard pouring rain is the hit man, Carl.  What a preposterous story.<br />Weird too, the birth of their long awaited baby is barely a footnote.  I would have thought it would be given more space than a bare mention.  Definitely not Mr. White's best.	2004-06-15
US	30926743	RK2XNN6B4B62A	0440237416	700164567	Warning Signs	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Now This One Is Just Excellent!	I've been reading my way through Mr. White's novels and after a couple of the previous ones (CRITICAL CONDITIONS and HARM'S WAY), I was about to throw in the towel.  Glad he AND I persevered!  This novel is a keeper.  He didn't do his usual &quot;pile on too much ridiculously unbelievable stuff at the end&quot; and in this one his final revelation of the killer made perfect sense. Mr. White is clearly growing as a writer right before our very eyes.  Well done!!<BR> <br />Unfortunately, I can still just barely tolerate Alan Gregory.  Too bad Sam isn't the main character and then Alan could be a secondary he calls on occasionally when he needs to watch someone immerse themselves in a &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; type of whinefest.  I am so sick of hearing Alan grizzle about confidentiality.  He could have prevented Naomi's death if he had got off the fence much sooner.  The woman was clearly in terrible crises, I couldn't believe he kept letting her just walk out of his office.  Wimp.  If he couldn't bring himself to protect her, he should at least have put his family first.  He had plenty of latitude for some end runs around confidentiality.  Especially when he has the trustworthy Sam to confide in.  Whine, whine, whine.<br />Oh well, Alan is the cross we must bear so I'll try to be gracious.  The rest of the characters are so enjoyable.  I loved learning more about Lucy, she's wonderful!  And I completely sympathized with her feelings toward Ramp.  If only he could have channeled himself in a more productive manner, he had much to offer.  But he was so right about claiming the only way the world seems to pay attention is after mayhem.  So many great topics touched on in this novel and by such compelling characters.<BR>  <BR>Now if we could just kill off Alan in one of these catastrophes that keep attaching themselves to his family!!  And Lauren could marry Cozy.........	2004-06-14
US	30926743	R1A1ICD06ELQY0	0451201558	339633632	Cold Case (Alan Gregory)	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Why does he insult the reader so blatantly?	I really don't know why I keep reading Stephen White.  He can write a readable novel for the most part but then at the end he just keeps throwing one implausible thing after another at us until our intelligence is insulted.  How many times can a person be held at gunpoint but manage to get away?  And after Alan whined so pitifully about getting the bad guys some medical help IMMEDIATELY even if it meant all his friends could rot I found myself hoping someone WOULD shoot him!  I know he's a big humanitarian and all but he was just ridiculous during those parts.  That he would display so much compassion and concern for people who had just done their best to mercilessly end his life stretched my suspended disbelief just too far.  Shoot him already.<br />I liked all the members in Locard so much more than Alan. I read White's books for his secondary characters like Sam Purdy, I can barely tolerate whine-boy, and in this novel he is at his all time worst for stupidity and cluelessness.  I can believe that Alan would follow the bad guy right into the big woods like an idiot, but Kimber?  No way.  How stupid do you think we are Mr. White?<br />SPOILER:  But the real insult came with the resolution.  Like another reviewer said:  why in the world would the Franklin family pay to open that can of worms after so long?  White insulted us with that bit.  No way they would have done such a thing.  I guess all the fireworks at the end were supposed to make us forget that little detail.  This isn't the first time he has chosen an ending or a killer that doesn't fit the facts.  The real mystery here is why I keep reading these silly books.	2004-06-14

Every book requires the suspension of disbelief but this time he asks for too much and then he doesn't deliver the goods.  We're to believe that this particular killer could lift a dead body up and dump it into a cement mixer?  Or that this killer is strong enough to suspend one of the victims from his feet with a sword?  Not to mention that all this fancy and bizarrely sick killing is done by someone that has been otherwise a model citizen up to now?  The psychology just doesn't match. Not buying it.  I could go on and on about the other implausibilities.  The least of which is that this killer had all this time to slip off unnoticed to do all the killing given their role in the story.  Come on, Sam would have noticed.  I can't believe this one got by an editor.	2004-06-12

I couldn't decide who he had more contempt for:  his own characters or me as the reader.  This story was contrived, unbelievable, and unsatisfying.  His tacked on surprise ending casting Grace in a dark role in her own tragedy was distasteful to say the least.  His careless and senseless killing off of one person after another was even more so.  The truth certainly didn't set any of these people free, everyone in the story was left impoverished and diminished, and for what?   All in all the whole story just left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.	2004-05-18
US	30926743	R1J8Q7KP1482YZ	0553803409	717880439	Firestorm	Books	1	5	7	N	N	A major disappointment	I usually enjoy Iris Johansen but this book is at the bottom of the list for me.  The plot is interesting which is why I stayed with the book but her characters never came to life for me at all.  They weren't even vivid enough for me to see why they would fall in love with each other.  When I closed the book I felt like I had indeed been looking at them through smoke.  And for all the buildup toward the climax, the climax itself was....anti-climactic and unsatisfying.  But most disappointing is that it didn't ring true when she reveals the nemesis from the main character's original nightmare.	2004-04-12
US	30926743	REWWJMAVPHKN4	034544356X	336353882	Seduced by Moonlight (Meredith Gentry, Book 3)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	A Bit Disappointing	I enjoyed getting to peek in on Merry's world again but nothing really happened, no one grew or changed, no relationship deepened and little to nothing was explained.  The scene with Andais demonstrated that the Queen is gaining respect for Merry and knows her own son does not deserve to rule but that's about all that changed there.  And for all the horsing around in the bed did anyone notice that there wasn't one consummation that could result in pregnancy?  Lots of weird stuff but no one got down to the business of getting Merry with child.  <br />Check this one out from the library, you won't get much for your hardcover money.	2004-02-10
