The mother recounts her son's life and then Sean himself interjects with what he remembers of that time in his life. I didn't know that those with Autism remembered how they acted and why they did it. It's a real eye opener to the autism world. What many autistic kids do is not longer just \\"weird\\" and \\"pointless\\" behaviour. Sean explains why he did such repititious things. For anyone even remotely interested in autism and definitely for anyone who has an autistic in the family, this a must read. I was captivated and couldn't put the book down. What also makes this an interesting read is Sean was born in the 60's. Back then, there was very little known about Autism and what people thought they knew was later proved wrong. Raising an autistic kid in the 60's and 70's was a lot harder than it is today.	2004-10-02

When I first saw the book, I was trying to figure out how someone could possibly fill a whole book about hair. However I was pleasantly suprised to find there is lots to talk about. The chapters are called The History of Women's Hair, Hot Combs and Scarlet Ribbons, Ponytails and Purple Mohawks, What We Do For Love, Paychecks and Power Haircuts, Bald Truths, At the Salon, I'll Dye Until I Die and No More Bad Hair Days.<br /><br />In the History of Women's Hair we learn about how hair was cared for and styled in the past. Styles and customs are separated into races since a Caucasian, Latin American and an African American all have different hair as well as different customs about hair. In Hot Combs and Scarlet Ribbons, we learn about what different people do are had done to their hair. The book is full of interviews with all kinds of women from all over. How girls hair was styled depended on what the parents, teachers, peers and media thought was fashionable. Girls rarely decided themselves how their hair would be styled.<br /><br />In Ponytails and Purple Mohawks, we learn about how some people style or colour their hair to stand out. It also talks about how many lesbians cut their hair and why they do so. It talks about fitting in with stories like the one about the caucasian girl in an otherwise african-american school and how she wanted her thin blonde hair in corn rows since everyone else in her class had them. What We Do For Love talks about styling and colouring our hair the way our husbands want us to. At the same time, when some women divorce or leave an abusive husband, they change their hairstyle so that they feel they can start over. Paychecks and Power Haircuts talks about hair in the work world. In some jobs, you are required to play up your femininity so women with long curly hair are preferred over short straight or braided hair. In some cases, you can be fired for cutting your hair. In other jobs, especially ones where women are in the minority, looking feminine will make you stand out so more masculine cuts and styles are better.<br /><br />Bald Truths addresses those with Alopecia and those who lose hair due to Chemotherapy. We may not always realize it but hair is very important to women and those women without hair can suffer greatly. Besides being teased and looked upon strangely, they tend not to get as many looks from guys since hair is a big attraction. The chapter also looks at women who shave their heads, to attract attention, show they are lesbian or just downplay their femininity. At the Salon explains what both hairdresser and client get out of a trip to the salon. It's more than just a new do. Many hairdressers act like social workers, listening to clients problems and suggesting ideas. I'll Dye until I Die covers the history of hair dying as it went from something only a few did in secret to the present where lots do it. It talks about how coloring to cover grey came about and how different hair colours show different personality types.<br /><br />Finally, No More Bad Hair Days is the wrap up chapter, talking about how it might be if hair wasn't as important in the world as it is.

I believe that what we go through many incarnations and learn things each time. This could be one way of reviewing what you've learned. This book is not about reincarnation though, I don't want you to get confused. When Ed dies, he meets 5 people in heaven that touched his life in someway. Some he hasn't even met. But his life and their life were altered in some way. It's a great read if you are interested in life after death, or how life is interconnected. It is fiction but it does carry with it a lesson about interconnectedness. We are all connected in some way.<br />Even if you are not interested in these things, if you like reading about other's lives, it's a great book for that too. This book is definitely highly recommended.	2004-07-05

I really enjoyed reading about her psychic experience and trying not to say too much. I also enjoyed reading about her experiences in the gypsy camps. Whether or not witches of this kind existed back then in the way she is talking about is up in the air so I'm not sure what she is saying is true. I don't have reason to think she is lying or anything but I'm not sure it's quite how she said. It's an interesting read but it's not for learning about Witchcraft or Wicca. (Remember: Wicca is only 50 or so years old)	2004-06-26

I am shamed to admit this but it was partially because I didn't understand it in school and partially that I didn't TRY to understand it in school. Nevertheless, this was a very good introduction to voting in Canada. The author is Linda Granfield and the illustrations are by Craig Terlson. The illustrations are hilarious and definitely add character to the book. Topics include The right to vote, who can vote, getting on the voters list, voting map (ridings), parliament, History of voting, the different parties, fraud, and much more. With lots of little facts, this book is an excellent introduction.	2004-06-14

It not only shows life for 18 or so children from different parts of the world but give invaluable information about what children need to survive and what people are doing to ensure that all children get these needs fulfilled. The whole book is divided into 4 main chapters, Survival, Development, Protection and Participation. At the beginning of each of those chapters, is a definition of the word and basic ideas under those. E.g. Survial, definition, Water, Food, Home and Health.<br />Then each of those is investigated more deeply. Water is first, after the introduction we see how much water most of us in North America use and how much water some countries have to manage with. Also reasons why some places don't have enough (clean) water.  Then it's the story of children in a few places and how and where they get water from. Then it's the personal story of one child, with water as it's main theme. This setup is continued throughout the book using topics such as food, health, development, education, playing, war, child labour, disabilities, feelings, religion, name, nationality and freedom of expression. This is an awe inspiring and humbling book that I recommened to all who work with children and all who care about children the world over.	2004-06-14

If you had a particular question in mind, you could easily skip to that section but you can just as easily read it from front to back, which is what I did.<br />This book is a must for anyone interested in the basics of Judaism from it's major holidays, to what the Torah and Midrash are, to Judaic views on Adoption, Birth Control, Abortion and other ideas. It talks about thye Mezuzah, Jewish Dietary Laws, Traditions, Rituals, Converting, Zionism, The Holocaust and the different Modern movements. (Orthodox, Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist.

I am straight myself but and I enjoyed reading these stories. I didn't know that there were Lesbians and Gays who do NOT want marriage legalized for gays. I learned a lot about the institution of marriage as well. The book covers couples from all over the United States, of all ages and combinations, and all religious backgrounds. There are stories of couples who had a union ceremony and their parents did not show up. There are stories of the parents and extended family coming and being very supportive. There are small private ceremonies and large elaborate ones. Those who did not have a public ceremony talk about why they don't believe they need one and what they have done to show each other they care. There are pictures of each couple which makes the stories more personal and I enjoyed them more because of it. There are couples who have been together a year and some who have been together for over 20. Some were married in a church or other religious building and some where not. It's a very diverse book.<br />At the end there is an interview with a few different Reverands and Fathers, a Rabbi and a Wiccan High Priestess. Also in the first chapter before the stories, two different viewpoints are shown:<br />Why Gay People Should Seek the Right to Marry and<br />Since When is Marriage a Path to Liberation?<br />Another recommended book to Lesbians, Gays and anyone interested in the institution of Marriage, homosexual rights and learning new things.	2004-05-14

Princess Sultana's life is nothing like a the life of the Princesses of Britain. I knew that women in Saudi Arabia were completely veiled and that they were considered possesions of men there but I did not know to what extreme life is like there! The scariest part is that this book was published in 2001! This is not a story of life in Saudi Arabia a long time ago, it is what is happening there NOW.<br />Not enough people realize what life is like in some countries and it's our ignorance that is helping to keep these countries the way they are.<br />This story is Book I of the Princess Triologies, the other two being Princess Sultana's Daughters and Princess Sultana's Circle. I can't get a hold of these sequals fast enough, that's how much I 'enjoyed' this book. Enjoyed really isn't the right word as how can you enjoy reading about such horrible treatement of women!<br />It is important to understand that while Saudi Arabia is 100% Islamic, most of what is happening is not actually a part of the Islmaic Religion but is a twisted version of the Koran and convenient ignoring of some parts of it. Jean Sasson includes some passage from the Koran on women in the back of this book and while some of it seems barbaric to Westeners, a lot of what goes on in Saudi Arabia and other countries is NOT supported by the Koran. This book is not an attack on Islam.<br />I could talk about this book for hours and you would still be suprised and horrified when reading it. I could not prepare you for this book without actually typing the whole thing out.<br />I highly recommend this book although only to adults. There may be some younger people who could handle this but I'm 20 and I believe well educated and this was hard for me to digest.	2004-05-06

It is edited by Blumenfeld but each essay is written by a different author, giving us all different viewpoints as the authors are young, old, gay, straight, white, not-white and more.<br />This book is about more than just homophobia. It addressed heterosexism, bisexism, gender stereotypes, homosexual parenting, suicide of homosexuals, heterosexual marriage of gays and lesbians, lesbian baiting, censorship, AIDS and breaking free of homophobia.<br />I have learned a lot from this book and thought of things from a perspective I might not have thought about had I not read this book. For example, at the end of Chapter 12, there is a Heterosexual Questionnaire by Martin Rochlin, Ph.D. It is designed to be full of questions that homophobes ask homosexuals. Seeing it the other way around just proves how silly the questions gays are asked really are.<br />For example, \\"What do you think caused your heterosexuality?\\" or \\"Is it possible that your heterosexuality stems from a neurotic fear of members of the same sex?\\" or \\"The great majority of child molesters (95%) are heterosexuals. Do you really consider it safe to expose your children to heterosexual teachers?\\" That last questions contains a very true fact often conveniently 'forgotten' or more accurately, 'ignored' when accusing homosexuals of constantly molesting children. It simply isn't true.<br />Chapter 17 is by far my favourite chapter. In it, the author talks about Nadles, Berdaches and Winktes. These are homosexuals of the Navajos, American Indian and Lakota people respectively.<br />In these cultures, men and women are considered equals and therefore, a feminine man is not lowering himself. These 'man-women' are actually considered sacred and closer to God or the Sprits because they have the spirit of a man and a woman in them. They are considered very smart and parents are pleased if a Nadle, Berdache or Winkte pays attention to their children. Many teachers are of these peoples and they are often used as mediators or counsellors for marriages in crisis because it is said that they understand both the man and woman's viewpoint.<br />I also learned about bisexism, something I was not aware of. I did not know that gays and lesbians felt an ambivalence of sorts against those who identify as bisexuals and that since these bisexuals also receive discrimination from those who are straight, they are essentially left in between with seemingly no one on their side. Another thing I was not aware of is sodomy laws in the states and how homosexuality is actually outlawed in some states. In others, it is legal to be homosexual but not legal to engage in homosexual acts.<br />Overall, this book would make an excellent addition to the library of anyone studying homophobia, homosexuality or heterosexism. It would also make an excellent addition to the reading list of everyone else who cares about the future of our world.ntion to their children.

There were times when I was laughing, times when I was ready to cry and times when I wanted to kill some of the people for how they treated Paul. I could relate to some of his 'adventures' and since I've just recenlty come out of high school, I can very vividly recall my own. I have never seen Freaks and Geeks so this review is based on the book and the book alone.<br />My favourite part of the book was the beginning of the first chapter. Paul talks about how it's not fair that kids are named such brutal names such as Cox or Seaman. It is my favourite part because it is SO true. Kids can take any name, any name at all and turn it into something that just asks to be teased about.<br />Paul recounts his first loves, gym class, his first sexual stirrings, his fears and phobias, being bullied and most of all, being called a fag. Paul Feig was an adolescent in the 70's and everyone around him was calling everyone else a fag. Most of them probably didn't even know what it meant they just knew it was 'something they didn't want to be,' and so they called everyone else one.<br />Having just recently read about Homophobia, it was disconcerting to see the word so many times throughout the book. However this is not the fault of the author, but of the ignorant people who let their kids get away with such rude words. Things are different now than they were in the 70's (so I'm told since I wasn't yet born) regarding homosexuality but it still irks me to no end how cruel and demeaning people can be. Anyone feeling the same way may have some troubles getting through that chapter as I did. This is just a warning and does not take away from the rating of this book.<br />Kick me is written in an easy to read format and you don't have to be a college student to understand his writing. This is refreshing as a lot of books can be hard to follow if you don't have a certain level of reading ability. There is a lot of foul language in this book because Paul is recounting his adolescence and to block out what his peers said would greatly diminish the book. Although this is about adolescence, I would recommend this book to adults, not to adolescents. I would say 16 or over.<br />There were a couple of times when I wanted to know more than what was published. I almost want to contact Mr. Feig to ask him some questions. For instance, when he talks about kissing Cathy and how by the look on her face, he isn't sure if it was the best or worst kiss she had ever gotten. That is the end of the chapter and I'd like to know what happened between them after that. Was it the best or the worst? Did they ever talk again? Or date again?<br />Overall Kick Me was a well written and interesting book and it's nice to see something different being published.e in this book because Paul is recounting his adolescence and to block out what his peers said would greatly diminish the book.

However I am very impressed. Barbara Mathias and Mary Ann French did a superb job. These authors do not suggest you pretend race does not exist, in fact, they suggest you do not do that. The reader who said this book was 40 ways to program a child must have not actually read the book. The first section has advice for all parents and then the rest of the book is divided into age groups: Infancy through Preschool, The Early Elementary School years, The Upper Elementary School years, the Young Teen Years and the High School Years. Topics include: Insist on Respect, Select a Diverse Middle School, Face your Teen's Prejudice, Involve the Community and Don't Pretend Discrimination Doesn't exist.<br />The Very second item is about why White parents should care about racism. In Ms. Mathias Introduction, she approaches the potential risk in approaching racism in a format such as '40 Ways to...\\" and she assures us that she does not mean to imply that racism is not a serious matter but that parents have little time to read long books about parenting.  Ms. French also has an Introduction. These wonderful authors say that kids will notice differences and that's fine. While most of society thinks that going 'color-blind' will eliminate racism, these two (and I) do not agree. \\"Yes she does have darker skin than you. And you have lighter skin than her. It would be pretty boring if we were all the same wouldn't it?\\" is a premise of the book.<br />Finally, Ms. Mathis and Ms. French do not lay blame on any one race or age group. It's not the whites fault or the blacks or hispanics fault and it's not the parents fault or the kids fault. It's the communities fault and the community needs to work together to stop racism.	2004-04-09

Actually the teacher read it to us. Over 10 years later when I saw it at a used book store, I instantly picked up a copy and I don't have any kids. I re-read it myself and will read it every Christmas Season. It's about the Herdmans and the Christmas Pageant. The Herdmans are the worst kids in the history of the world and they end up as part of the pageant.<br />The pageant is about the Birth of Jesus which the Herdmans know nothing about. It's a very funny story throughout and a very touching story at the end. You don't really have to be Christian to enjoy this little story. I'm not and I love the story. I definitely recommend it to almost every family as a story to be read year after year. As your kids grow, perhaps they can read it to you.	2004-04-09

It talks about how if you go on a diet, then that inplies that at some time you will be going off of it. In order to maintain a healthy weight, you would need to keep to the same pattern of eating and exercise.<br />It talks about the difference between exercise like going jogging or to the gym and activity like mowing the lawn and taking stairs instead of elevators.<br />The book will help you calculate your BMI (Body Mass Index) to figure out if you are overweight and by how much. Then based on that how many calories you should take in a day. It has a brief chapter on weight loss programs like Weight Watchers, Atkins, TOPS and also talks about fad diets like the Grapefruit diet and the Cabbage Soup diet. It has a chapter on weight loss medications and one on weight loss surgeries.<br />There is no Mayo Clinic Diet, it's just eating healthily and keeping fit for your entire life without deprivation or unrealistic goals.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone who is looking to lose weight, maintain weight or just eat healthier.

I still wanted to review it though.<br />What makes me wary of this book, is that the first thing it says is &quot;Witches do not eat babies, and they're not Satanists.&quot; I read a book to learn about the subject, not learn what it is not about. While I have no problem with a section on misconceptions, I don't believe it should be the very first paragraph.<br />This is a book for a Jack of All Trades. It covers a lot of subjects but doesn't actually have a lot on each subject. Some subjects covered include: History of Magick, Wicca and Witchcraft, Folklore, Tools, Symbolism, Sacred Space, Meditation, Prayer, Dreams, Hexcraft, Ritual, Divination, Elements, Kitchen Witchery, the role of color, shape etc... in Magick, Minerals, Plants, Animals, Astrology, Numerology, Divinities, Sacred Places, Healing and Coven Craft all within 290 pages.<br />Some topics are only covered in a paragraph. Good points I found were that is seems to have correct information. The author explains the difference between Wicca and Witchcraft and doesn't rave about 9 million witches being killed during the Burning Times. The short Folklore and Superstitions chapter was interesting.<br />There are a few sample spells but they are really simple and made to show you how to make your own. There were a few parts I read word for word because they interested me but other than that. I would be wary of a book that tries to incorporate Everything into one book. There is a glossary at the back of the book as well.<br />I enjoyed the meditation section. Many books that describe how to meditate, are really confusing. While the section is small, it's easy to understand. It also teaches you how to adapt spells to fit your life and needs. It does give a brief section on how to make your own spells too. It does cover a few things that most other basics books don't, but like I've said all along, each section is brief.e said all along, each section is brief.	2003-06-10

Pig Pig Goes to Camp wasn't as good as Pig Pig Grows Up but it was still really funny. It is a good introduction to sleep-away camp for kids ages 7 - 9. The one part that I didn't like although many people think it's funny is that the Camp Director sends Pig Pig home because he's having too much fun and is too popular. I think the idea was that he was sent home because of all his little Frog friends but it comes across the wrong way.	2003-04-10

Seventh Heaven (and I have no idea why it's called that,) is a story of a small community where every house is the same and everyone is married with children and everybody is happy (or at least pretends to be) and everything is perfect. Then Nora Silk and her two boys move in. Nora is divorced and is raising her children by herself. In all the other families, the man works and the woman stays home but because Nora is on her own, she works.<br />Nora is treated harshly because she's different. Her kids aren't always spotless and they don't get the most nutritious meal but she does the best she can. As time goes on, things change in the community, everything is a little off.<br />Seventh Heaven has some adult material and so I wouldn't recommended it for young teenagers or kids. It has sex and one instance of murder in it.	2003-03-20

I am very suprised at how good of a writer Jennifer Hunter is. When I first ordered this book, I was just going by it's title and when I got it, I was dissapointed because it looked like another stupid beginner's book with the same old information as every other one. It got put to the side and then I packed up my room because we were redoing it. 6 months later I unpacked it and have been reading it and I am astonished at how good it is and mad at myself for not giving it a chance. I especially like the chapters on Magic and Everyday Magic (living as a Witch.)<br />The book is divided into three parts, Maiden, Mother and Crone. Chapters include: Energy Work, Diety, Magic, Sabbats, Ritual, Magical Tools and Altars, Initiation, The Other Side, Commmunity, Relationships, Teenage Trip and College Life and more. There are quotes from real witches scattered throughout the book and she provides exercises too. The exercises are fun!<br />I most definitely recommend this book to beginners but even if you aren't a beginner, this book is very informational. As the preface says:<br />&quot;I wrote this book because I felt that most of the books on Wicca were giving us too much of what we didn't need: flowery rituals, tables of correspondances, complicated spells -- and yet, virtually no information about the reasons behind all that.&quot;<br />How true! Hunter does a superb job of fulfilling her goal.	2003-03-03

I didn't like it very much then but I've sinced realized why that is. I like thinking about the books I read but I don't want to write three essays on a part of it I don't care about. I'm sure many of you agree with me.<br />Anyways, this book is thought provoking. I've seen the movie too and they are both good.<br />It makes you wonder what life was like many years ago and how we have evolved. (NOTE: This has nothing to do with creation vs. evolution, even if you believe we were created, we have still evolved since we were first put on this earth.) It's about savages and human nature.<br />A similar book that I would recommended for older teens and adults would be Second Nature by Alice Hoffman.	2003-02-27

I've read it many times since then. The two young teens who are main characters in the book are troubled teens. I'm not saying that this book will make things better or give you the answer or anything, just that you might like it if you are troubled.<br />To those of you who are studying it in school right now, I know it might seem stupid, but stick with it. Actually read it, enough to retain it. As you get older, I think it will come back to you at certain parts of your life.	2003-02-27

It reminds me a little of Harry Potter except that they aren't all witches/wizards.<br />If you aren't allowed to read Harry Potter you probably won't be allowed to read this one but it is really good. I read it 6 years ago but I still remember it well.	2003-02-27

This book has a lot of information on the history of Wicca and Witchcraft (she acknowledges that they are NOT the same) and is a very interesting read if you want to know more about how covens work. She thoroughly explains the difference between the first, second and third degrees and also describes the basic rites that you go through to get these degrees.<br />I had some trouble reading this book. (I'm 19) The text is small and Crowley uses complex wording. It is definitely not the first book you should read on Wicca. I wouldn't really call it a beginner's book but it does have some basic information in it. I would say that you should probably be able to read at the Grade 12 level at least to fully comprehend this book. I often had to re-read a paragraph and you may want to put a dictionary beside you as you read. Despite this, it is very interesting and informative.<br />It isn't necessary to own this book but it is a good idea to read it thoroughly. What I mean is, you probably won't be going back to it very often once you understand the information in it. It's not a resource.<br />V. Crowley uses a LOT of quotes from C. Jung and it may be a good idea to read a bit about him yourself, although this is not required.	2003-02-25

This was one of the first books I ever read on Witchcraft. I also recommmend Living Wicca by Scott Cunningham in addition to this book.<br />I am going to buy myself a copy soon.<br />Update: Feb. 25/03<br />I borrowed this book from my brother and am reading it again and have been noticing quite a few things that I'm not sure are correct. Things such as Witchcraft being a religion (I'm still not sure of my take on that) and she calls what I know of as the Wiccan rede as the Witches Creed but not all Witches follow it. She says that Satanists worship the devil (which they don't) and when talking about the Burning Times, does not mention that most of the people who died weren't actually witches, and I am only at Chapter 2!	2003-01-05

There aren't many books out there on these subjects. Some contributors Patricia Telesco, Grey Cat, Oz and more. <br />After each essay is a short bio of the author and the book containes black and white photos, some of which are very interesting to look at. Also, after some of the essays, is a list of suggested reading if you want to learn more about the particular subject.	2003-01-05

I have never read the other too. In fact, this is the only book I have read from Conway. I found this book helpful. I am however wary of the fact that one person could be knowledgeable enough to write about Celtic, Norse and Egyptian Magic.<br />Nevertheless, I personally do not follow the Celtic path but most of the information in this book pertains to anyone doing magic. A lot of people give negative reviews to this book. However, I liked it and found it useful. This book is good for a beginner. Included information on: Celtic Magic, Preparing for Magic, Magical elements, Casting a Magic circle, Tools of Magic, Sabbats, Celtic History and Deities. It also has a section on Spellwork: Herb Magic, Cauldron Magic, Stone Magic, Candle Magic and a few other things. This books rituals and circles are geared more to a coven than a Solitaire.	2003-01-05

It's easy to understand with little side notes and examples.<br />Here are just SOME of the things that the book has: All about Wicca and Witchcraft, History, Praciting Wicca, Deities, So you want to be a witch, Ritual, Magick, Magick Circle, Dedication, Preparing for Ritual, Pentagram, Esbats, Sabbats, Summon/Stir/Call Faeries, Dragons etc..., Nature, Witches Pyramid, Correspondances, Timing, Candles, poppets, potions, mirrors, spells, making spells, divination, dreams and more!!<br />Since this book has info on lots of subjects, you can see what interests you and then pursue further books from there. E.g. If after reading this book you find you like the idea of working with candles, you could check out a book on Candle Magick.<br />This book is well worth the price.	2003-01-05

I have never read the first one. It's such a shame that Cunningham is not still around to write more books.<br />I do not own this book at the present time, but I had it in my posession for a period of about 2 years and I read it many times during those 2 years. I am now working on getting my own copy.<br />I enjoyed the 13 goals of a witch, which I later wrote an essay about and his way of crushing your myths without making you feel stupid or naive.<br />Living Wicca is a great book to read even if you practice in a coven most of the time.	2003-01-05

You've been feeling blah but you aren't sad? Feel out of synch? Not harmonized? Then you need this book.<br />The Rainbow in your Life talks about how different colours affect you and they way you think and act. There is a GREAT quiz that helps you decide what colours you should be wearing, eating, decorating with and more. Some of the questions in the quiz are &quot;What is your favourite season?&quot; &quot;Review your wardrobe and list the three most predominant colours,&quot; and &quot;List the three dominant colours in your bathroom.&quot;<br />These questions and more will help you see if your are surrounding yourself with the right colours. Once you figure out your colour(s), you can go to the appropriate section and see suggestions on lighting, food, fashion and how your colour(s) affect your family, career, health, relationships, friends and even vehicles.<br />You will also find info on the different types of colour: neons and pastels, different tones, monochromatic and more. The book has instructions on creating your own Colour Mandala to aid in meditation. There are even small sections on Auras and Dreams.<br />This book is HIGHLY recommended.	2003-01-05

To some elders in the craft, it may sound childish, a book of spells, but that's not what it is. It's more than that.<br />It includes information needed to write your own spells as well as good spells for the modern witch. Topics include: Divorce, Gardening, Habits, Negative Energy, Unwanted Guests, PMS, Wisdom and more. She includes three appendices in the back of the book: Magical Uses of Herbs, Plants and Flowers, the Magical Uses of Stones and Dieties and Their Magical Associations.<br />Dorothy Morrison presents the spells and rituals in an easy to understand format. She offers spells and rituals from very easy which are basically light a candle and say a chant to much more involved ones which require stones and herbs. The thing is, she makes it fairly easy to find a substitute if you don't have what the spell calls for.<br />This is by far the best book of spells and rituals I have seen thus far and I recommend it whole heartedly.	2002-12-30

I am now 19 and I occasionally go back to it although not much. I found it a bit helpful three years ago, but it is something, you won't really need after you are past the beginner stage.<br />It wasn't really bad or really good. It could have been better if it didn't have spells in it. I personally believe (as do many others) that you shouldn't even be practicing magic until you know more about it.<br />I can't really tell you whether to get this book or not. There are more than likely two types of people looking at these reviews right now. Young teens and parents of young teens. To each of you, this is what I say:<br />Young Teens: This is a good beginners book, there are better, but this book is good. Maybe you could borrow it off of someone or see if it's in the library. If you follow through with becoming a Pagan, you most likely won't need to refer back to it much later in life.<br />Parents of Young teens: It is OKAY for your child to read this book. If you aren't sure, check out the look inside option first. Read it yourself first if you want to as well. Then buy him or her Wicca: a guide for the solitary practioner by Scott Cunningham. In addition to Teen Witch so that you child can see that there is more than one view about Witches and Pagans.	2002-12-30

This one was by far one of the best. It has places for you to write down your feelings on the subject being discussed. I read a chapter, answer the questions then put it down. The next day, I reread the chapter, reread the answers, and sometimes add stuff, the next day, I do the 2nd chapter. I suggest you do it this way too, but it is up to you. This book helped me realize that I had a lot of built up anger.	2001-02-09

This book has made me research Autism and Aspergers Syndrome (related) and I am even making a report on it just because I want to. This book is touching.

Finally, one day I came across this book. It was great! I go back to it all the time. After an information filled section on each sabbat, you will find a short story on some aspect of that holiday, followed by a section entitled Earth Magic. In this section you will find sample rituals, garb, prepartation, herbcraft, spellcraft, magical stones and lore. The rituals are for groups though, that is the only problem, but I suppose you could change them for solitary use. Earth magic also has recipies for oil mixtures and some spells to try out.<br />Following Earth Magic you will find the section entitled Holiday Fare. This is where you will find recipies for dishes you can make for meals or desserts. After that you will find Ancient Activities which includes crafts and lore related to the season.<br />Even the appendices have valueable information that will have you looking back again and again. I don't rate many books with 5 stars, only the ones I believe truly deserve it, and this book is one of them.	2001-01-03
