As I've stated in several other reviews, I used to read this series of books to my much-younger adopted sisters back when they were first in print in the 80s and early 90s. Now that I have a child of my own I have been re-collecting these books to read to him. <br />Why Are You So Mean To Me? is a story probably most parents will be able to sympathize with -- Grover goes to his school picnic with a brand-new baseball bat from his mother, and after confessing he has never played baseball before to the ever-obnoxious Truman (the same Truman from Grover Goes to School), Grover is picked last for the baseball game when Truman whines that Grover has never played before and will make his team lose.  Grover tries hard to prove him wrong but loses the game for his team, while the rest of the kids on his team chime in with the tormenting Truman in ridiculing him.  Grover, upset about this awful treatment from his classmates, takes out his frustration on an unsuspecting Big Bird, who is understanding about the situation and proves what a great friend he is by practicing baseball with Grover until he gets one hit, and gives him a painting as a present.  <br />The artwork is a bit weak here but the message is solid and will help children who might find themselves in this situation with the knowledge that someone, even if it's the fictitious Grover, knows what they are going through and that they do have true friends who will always care about them, and conversely it shows how much mean words can really hurt others and that you should always take great care in what you say to other people.  A must-have for anyone with school-aged children.	2002-04-11

Is it me or is every review they do of this series of books negative and completely non-specific? Obviously the individual who reviewed these books for them has completely forgotten what 5 and 6 years old actually like to read in books. Oh well.<br />As I've stated in several other reviews, I used to read this series of books to my sisters back when they were first in print in the 80s and early 90s. Now that I have a child of my own I have been re-collecting these books to read to him. <br />Ernie and Bert's New Kitten should be a mandatory purchase for anyone who bought the Two Wheels for Grover Book, as it shows children the actualities involved with being responsible for a kitten. Ernie and Bert get one of Susan's cat's new kittens and don't quite seem to know what they are getting into beforehand -- Bernie the kitten dumps his food and water all over the floor, destroys Bert's paper clip collection, and scatters their favorite possessions all over the apartment/house they live in. The last straw for Ernie comes when Bernie chews a hole in Rubber Duckie, and he hollers at the terrified kitty. Bert calms him down, fixes Rubber Duckie, and they both realize that having a kitten is a lot like having an Ernie -- cute and funny but also messy and kind of clueless sometimes. <br />This book is definitely not Hautzig's best, and the ending is a bit weak (is it really a great idea to show that yelling at one's pets is okay behavior?) but overall it gives a good overview of what actual pet ownership entails. Required reading for any children begging their parents for a pet.	2002-04-11

As I've stated in several other reviews, I used to read this series of books to my much-younger adopted sisters back when they were first in print in the 80s and early 90s. Now that I have a child of my own I have been re-collecting these books to read to him.<br />My sisters LOVED this book and my son also loves it as well.  It is the first day of school for Grover, who is nervous about making new friends and not knowing anyone at his new school.  After being a bit overwhelmed by the amount of kids in his new class, Grover starts to go way out of his way to be helpful and be popular with all the children.  First he trades his new crayons for a beat up truck missing 3 wheels, then he misses cookie time after volunteering to clean up after the other kids.  He keeps being nice to fault until Truman (who keeps offering him awful things for trade) swaps him for his jelly sandwich -- Grover can't say no because he is too afraid Truman will not like him.  Grover can't take it anymore and starts to cry.  It is only when he starts acting like himself that he makes friends -- Molly, who cheers him up after seeing him so upset, and Bill, who Grover says no to for a trade, but who also loves to play jacks, Grover's favorite game.  A wonderful, affirming story about the value of friendship and how true friends like you for you.<br />This is the creme de la creme of this entire series and if you have a child who loves Sesame Street this is a must-own.	2002-03-15

Now that I have a child of my own I have been re-collecting these books to read to him. <br />Don't Cry Big Bird centers around Big Bird and his frustration with his large size -- he's too big to jump rope, too big to play hopscotch, and can never find a good hiding place.  One day it just gets to be too much and he starts to cry, that is until Snuffy sees him and tries to cheer him up, telling him \\"you are a very nice size -- big, like me.\\"  Big Bird's friends are also concerned about him not being able to play their games, that is until they start to change their games -- tying two ropes together, making super-size hopscotch boxes, etc.  They run to get Big Bird who is delighted to finally be able to join in, and discovers he can be great at being \\"IT\\" in hide and seek.  His height even comes in handy when Betty Lou's kite gets stuck in a tree.<br />While the writing in this book is not quite as strong as in the ones in this series by Elliott and Hautzig, it is still a very positive story with good artwork to support it.	2002-03-15

Now that I have a child of my own I have been re-collecting these books to read to him.  <br />The artwork in this book is not nearly as strong as one sees from the usual Sesame Series artists, Chartier and Matheiu, but you can certainly recognize all the characters in Grover's classroom from previous books in this series.  The basis of the storyline for this book centers on Barry, a new kid starting school in Grover's class.  Grover goes out of his way repeatedly to help Barry, and even overlooks some of his rude behavior (ie pushing Molly out of the way and cutting in line on the slide at lunch) to be his friend.  After Barry draws a fire truck on Grover's post-lunch masterpiece painting, Grover has had the last straw and confronts Barry, who then apologizes, saying he 'forgot how to be nice today', and then Barry has a complete turnaround and is helpful and friendly to all the other children and Grover.  While it is understandable to the adults reading this book why Barry is acting the way he is (nervous about being new and not acting like himself), this is never really clarified enough for a young child to really understand.  (My sisters used to always wonder why Barry was so mean and that it didn't make any sense for him to act so mean to the other kids when he didn't know them).  The author also does not seem to keep the previous classmates used in other books in character -- I admit to laughing out loud at Truman's criticism of Barry's rude behavior when he was himself the rude antagonist in the Grover Goes to School book, the first of the Grover books in this series.<br />This is a good choice if your child is as crazy about Grover as mine is, or you like to read the Grover books to your children, but it you are looking for the best of this series, this is not one of them.	2002-03-13

As I've stated in several other reviews, I used to read this series of books to my much-younger adopted sisters back when they were first in print in the 80s and early 90s.  Now that I have a child of my own I have been re-collecting these books to read to him.  <br />The focus of this book is -- yep you guessed it -- Grover's new jacket, sent to him as a gift (is it his birthday?  hmmm guess we will never know) by his grandma.  Grover is the envy of Sesame Street in his vintage 1980s Members-Only style red jacket, and wears it everywhere to bring him luck at school, playing jacks, etc.  He wins the part of the prince in his class's school play and while he works hard to practice his lines, he knows his jacket will bring him the luck he needs to do the part well.  That is of course until he loses it backstage right as the show starts, almost has a complete nervous breakdown, and wants to quit the show right then and there.  After a pep talk from the ever-supportive Mr. Lester, Grover goes on and does the part beautifully, even without his jacket -- which he is happily reunited with at the end of the book.<br />Hautzig does a good job with this book, centering the story on the common young childhood drama of a favorite/lucky object and being parted with it, and having to deal with being without it.  Chartier's artwork is nicely done and supports the story well.  The book is one of the better ones in the series and a worthy addition to your Sesame Street book collection.	2002-03-13

Books	4	3	3	N	N	Not Dan Elliott's Best In This Series But Still Good	As I've stated in several other reviews, I used to read this series of books to my much-younger adopted sisters back when they were first in print in the 80s and early 90s. Now that I have a child of my own I have been re-collecting these books to read to him. <br />TWO WHEELS FOR GROVER centers on Grover's trip to see his cousins in the country (and from the artwork it looks like they had a VERY long drive to get there).  Cousin Rosie wants to go bike riding with Grover but since Grover can't ride a two wheeler, he hems and haws every time she asks, making excuses and sadly watching her ride away.  Cousin Frank astutely sees through this charade at a later point and offers to teach him how to ride a bike.  Grover is of course terrified but gets it, and masters the skill just in time to follow Rosie to Farmer Finn's to get a free kitten.<br />The artwork is only okay in this book -- could someone explain to me by the way why every character in this book wears clothing except for Grover? -- and the story is good albiet kind of predictable.  The one gripe I have with the book as a parent is Grover's getting  a kitten without consulting his mother and then bringing it home with him without telling her.  There is no mention of this in the book of course, and his mother does not say anything about it, but I for one don't think it is a terrific idea to be presenting this kind of thing as normal and something that happens regularly without consequences.  But this is a minor quibble.<br />Overall this book is good but far from Elliott's -- the strongest writer in this series -- best work.  Check out Grover Goes to School for the best he has to offer.	2002-03-13

Whether you are a figure skater or not, Donald Jackson's biography will help to inspire you to push yourself farther than you ever thought possible.  An entertaining and easy-to-follow book, Mr. Gross profiles the career of 1962 World Champion and men's Canadian figure skater Donald Jackson, who landed the first triple lutz in skating history -- a jump that was so difficult at the time it would be years before anyone else duplicated his feat.  This skater's tale of overcoming obstacles, the sorrow of the 1961 plane crash that killed the entire US figure skating team and coaches, and most of all, dealing with the weight of the expectations of the skating world will surprise you -- mostly in how hard you will find to put it down!  Excellent, excellent book and a GREAT look at skating in the early 1960s.  If you are a fan of the sport of figure skating, this book will find a place of distinction in your collection.	2001-08-13

I have the paperback version of this book, and if you are a fan of Nancy, Oksana, Kristi or Michelle you NEED to have this book.  While the written profiles of the skaters don't really offer the reader any new and/or groundbreaking information, and only cover these skaters' careers from 1996 and earlier, it's worth it for the illustrations alone, which are gorgeous and wonderfully done.  While geared more towards the younger reader it is still a must have for fans of any of these four skaters.	2001-08-08

There are several photos of Kristi in Albertville, both on the podium and standing with her medal after the ceremony that I've not seen in any other book and that brought back great memories of watching it live all those years ago.  One of the more interesting parts of this book is that it was written before Kristi decided to turn pro, and talks about her plans for Lillehammer in 1994 (how great would that have been if it had been true?).   Some of the photos are incorrectly captioned, and the book doesn't really reveal any ground-breaking information about Kristi or her life that hasn't already been covered in other books, but I recommend it for the photos.  If you are a BIG Kristi fan, regardless of your age, this book will fit nicely into your collection.  Otherwise, for a better book on Kristi and skating in general, check out her &quot;Figure Skating for Dummies&quot;.	2001-08-08

I bought this book when it came out around 1994/95 and re-read it recently.  The best part of this book is the section where Ms. Wilkes, a Canadian Olympic medalist in pairs, talks about her experiences coming up in the sport.  It's a great read and gives the reader a lot of insight into what the sport was like at the height of the Cold War.   The rest of the book is basically commentary on skating at the time the book was written.  I thoroughly enjoyed the parts that talked about Kurt and Elvis, but I didn't really agree with some of her favorites in the ladies' department (she also doesn't seem to be much of a fan of Kristi Yamaguchi, who is one of my favorite skaters, so that might have something to do with it).  But this is a minor complaint.  Buy this book for the great retrospective on the 1994 Olympic season and for Ms. Wilkes'very absorbing tales of skating in the 1960s.	2001-08-01

It's engaging and written in a very conversational tone that was easy to follow.  The main characters were also written with a great deal of emotion and depth, and you as a reader see them as the narrarator does.  It's paced in a way that makes you really not want to stop and put it down.<br />Besides some of the other things other reviewers have brought up re: the downsides of this book, the one thing I would warn any potential readers about The Red Tent is that it is very, VERY depressing.  Do not read this book if you are not in a good mood because it will most certainly NOT cheer you up.  It is not by any means a happy, 'feel good' kind of story.<br />Despite the rather depressing story I still got wrapped up in the book, with its descriptiveness and language, and after all, that's why we read in the first place!  An excellent choice for adults who love historical fiction.	2001-07-31

Jill gives a first-hand look at what it's like to skate for the Winter Olympics's biggest prize -- a medal in ladies figure skating -- and the story is complemented well with photos of Jill before during and after the competition as well as other photos from the Calgary Olympics that also bring you into her story. <br />Jill was very much in contention for one of the medals and although she ended up finishing just off the podium she has an excellent attitude, and describes her certificate indicating her finish with as much pride as if it were a medal.  I would highly suggest buying this book if you know a young skater whose dream it is to go to the Olympics, as the most important thing both my sister and I took away from this book was not that she almost won a medal, but that she was THERE, in the middle of the Battle of the Brians, the Duel of the Carmens, and that she really enjoyed the whole experience of trying to skate her best at the biggest competition in the world.	2001-07-31

I totally agree that one would be hard pressed to find anyone more qualified to write an instructional book about skating than Kristi, who's not only an Olympic gold medalist in ladies singles but is also a 2 time senior national champion in pairs.  The book is well structured and easy to follow.  Some may argue that the technical jump/spin section doesn't go into super-minute mathematical detail, but it really shouldn't have to, as a book really can't teach anyone figure skating from scratch and anyone who wants to learn to skate absolutely needs specific, on ice training to learn the basics.  Kristi's book is a great supplement to on ice training however, and like another reviewer noted, it's helped me look at some of my technique problems and fix them as well, especially on the dreaded camel spin.<br />Good for fans of skating and skating participants, but if you want to learn how to skate, you will first need lessons on the ice, although you may find that this book will help you a lot as a supplement as you advance.	2001-07-31

I bought this book on the recommendation of friends and I'm glad I did -- it's a wonderful look inside skating though the words of the skaters and skating community themselves, with very little editorial commentary. The stories are easy to follow and really bring a different perspective into the wins, losses, triumphs and tragedies the skating world has gone through over the past half century. I enjoyed all the stories in the book except for one, where a couple of hockey players discuss power skating. Normally I wouldn't care one way or the other about it except that one of them pretty much trashes the sport of figure skating in a statement he makes, and I question the inclusion of this in a book aimed at figure skaters and fans (who akready have to hear stuff like this enough as it is!) But this is a minor quibble. Skip the hockey player story and you'll be fine. :)	2001-07-30

I'll keep it for the recipies I can use later but a more accurate title would be &quot;Better Toddler Food&quot; because it seems to focus on the 1 year old and up food arena with the recipies, etc that take up the vast majority of space in the book.	2001-07-24

While the story did center on Georgiana, I didn't feel cheated from seeing lots of Lizzie, Darcy, Jane and Bingley, and the rest of the main characters from the original book.  The writing style was solid -- however the one thing that irked me a bit was the way some of the characters spoke.  Kitty sounded exactly like Lydia -- in fact every time I read her dialogue Lydia popped into my head instead of Kitty -- and I just cannot for the life of me see Darcy calling Elizabeth 'Lizzie' as Jane did. The only other small gripe I had with the book is the way the romance was resolved at the end with Georgiana.  Her feelings towards the man she did pick at the end seemed totally sudden and was therefore awkward to read and just didn't feel genuine.<br />Not a bad try at a sequel, and it was nice to catch up with all the Bennetts, Darcys, Bingleys, Collins, and the rest again.	2001-07-17

Books	2	5	10	N	N	Book is Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde....	I'll agree with most of the reviews here that this book really gives you the low-down on most essential baby items.  For example, it helped me navigate through the rather complicated jungle of baby cribs and furniture to find what worked best for my money and for my daughter -- I went with Pali as recommended and it really is top notch quality stuff for the dollar.  I would never have known this without the help of the book.<br />I do agree with several other reviewers that the book tends to censure certain options in baby care (someone mentioned cloth diapers earlier).  The worst of this is on pages 228-229 where the authors compare baby formula and certain direct mail pieces sent out by formula companies to new moms to -- get this! -- cigarettes and beer! I both breast and bottle feed and found this comparison to be highly insensitive the the majority of moms out there who either bottle feed exclusively or who are like me and do both, as well as offensive (comparing formula to controlled substances, come on, is that REALLY necessary?). This mini-article also calls for an end to direct marketing of formula, which is extremely odd considering that (a) all the mail pieces I get from my chosen formula company usually have $8.00 off coupons, (b) the free bag I got at the hospital had a ton more coupons for formula wipes and diapers and the like -- this IS supposed to be a book about saving money and these things saved me a LOT of money (if I were to guess, to date probably at least fifty bucks if not more than that).  If you're a bottle feeding mom in any capacity, and you still want to buy this book, do yourself a favor and rip out those two pages.<br />I also agree with earlier reviewers that coupon sites and ways to earn coupons for baby essentials like diapers, wipes, rash ointment, etc should have been addressed as I know I depend on them.	2001-03-30
US	50610867	R25V0CAWSUF3P0	068484673X	518170907	The OFFICIAL BOOK OF FIGURE SKATING	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Hmmm.....	...is the best way to describe my feelings for this book. I agree with several of the reviewers here that another proofreading would have been in order as there are several mistakes and bits of misinformation in the book. However, there are no more mistakes in this book as there have been in other recent skating history books like Inside Figure Skating -- but unlike that book, \\"Official Book\\" is an objective and technical presentation of the sport of figure skating. The jump and other technical description sections are also nicely done.<br />This book should definitely be part of your skating book collection -- just not your official 'dictionary' of reference.	2001-03-11
