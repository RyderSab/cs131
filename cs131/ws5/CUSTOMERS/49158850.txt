I find that I usually learn a lesson better after making a mistake than if things had gone smoothly.  In the same vein, a straight-up rebuke often changes a bad course while a dozen nice \\"words to the wise\\" fail to get my attention.  \\"78 Reasons...\\" takes this corrective path, and does so admirably.  An editor who has experienced the bad and the good, Pat Walsh is eminently qualified to tell it like it is.  And he does so without mincing words (although there's some humor to leaven things a bit).  Many the 78 and 14 reasons average about a page, while some are bit longer.  But all are worth reading by an aspiring author who seeks the holy grail of publication.<br /><br />Bottom line, many of the obstacles to getting published are due to character flaws, lack of talent, or industry ignorance on the part of the would-be author.  For example, the person who won't revise a manuscript, cannot tell a story, or doesn't understand the publishing game.  These folks often refuse to believe that the problem is between the chair and the keyboard.  That's sad, because a little self-correction can go a long way.  Thin-skinned writers that refuse to work on their weaknesses, or who are simply annoying jerks, won't get published.  Indeed, their biggest creation will be a bad reputation among editors and publishers.<br /><br />As for the 14 good reasons, they are mostly virtues that will serve anyone well regardless of occupation.  Taking calculated risks, being flexible, and learning from rejection are all qualities that can lead to publication for a humble, solid writer with something to say.  In addition to the correction and encouragement, Mr. Walsh provides a look into the nuts and bolts of the publishing world.  He serves up interesting information about writing conferences, self-publishing, agents, and much more.  Even those merely curious about how books get from manuscript to shelf (virtual or otherwise) will find these insights fascinating.<br /><br />This is a necessary manual for a writer.  And as Mr. Walsh warns, don't skip the 78 in favor of the 14.  If you do that, you may miss out on the boot to the head you need to get on the right track towards publication.necessary manual for a writer.

The guy who played Christ walked through the part like an emotionless robot.  Later he regretted showing his bare chest during the crucifixion scene, saying that, \\"I save it for my wife.\\"  It's this kind of limp attitude towards Christ and masculinity that \\"No More Christian Nice Guy\\" takes a stand against.<br /><br />The book is an entry into the \\"Wild At Heart\\" and \\"Tender Warrior\\" segment of the Christian men's genre.  It's the author's contention that male believers have fallen prey to passivity, and also follow an emasculated parody of Christ.  His strong face-offs against the Pharisees and other confrontational moments are ignored.  Instead, today's \\"gentle Jesus\\" kind of man shows no emotion and has no backbone.  Many believe that it's better to be a \\"Christian Nice Guy\\" (CNG) for the sake of \\"harmonious fellowship.\\"  Rebuke is labeled as \\"unloving,\\" so people are allowed to continue along harmful paths without needed correction.  Risks are avoided in favor of \\"praying about it first,\\" so crucial ministries go unfilled.  And Christian men seeking to be equally yoked are labeled as \\"predators\\" by sisters who consider dating a swear word.<br /><br />I've seen the damaging results of the CNG trend in the church as well, and even bought into some of it despite the protests of my conscience. The author, while praising the original goals of the feminist movement, blames it for shaming men into becoming CNGs.  Ironically, modern women express dismay at the CNG, and either avoid dating them or regret marrying one.  \\"No More Christian Nice Guy\\" calls for men to put on the strong masculinity that women find attractive, but leave behind the macho and chauvinist attitudes that dishonor them.  Passive response is rejected in favor of being proactive for God's glory.  Showing genuine emotion, taking courageous (not foolhardy) risks, and rebuking wrong behaviors are held up as exemplary behaviors that are helpful to others.<br /><br />Mr. Coughlin challenges those with a Y chromosome to be good men instead of nice guys.  There seems to be a backlash building against the \\"CNG\\" phenomenon.  I pray that \\"No More Christian Nice Guy\\" will continue that trend and encourage a generation of mighty Christian men to come forth.helpful to others.   <br /> <br />Mr. Coughlin challenges those with a Y chromosome to be good men instead of nice guys.

Unlike some of his peers, he led by example and without tormenting his charges.  During a routine patrol in Iraq, he absorbed a grenade blast to save his fellow Marines.  \\"The Gift of Valor\\" provides a glimpse into Cpl. Dunham's life before his terrible wounding, and the medical treatment odyssey he endured afterwards.  He was posthumously nominated for the Medal of Honor.<br /><br />\\"The Gift of Valor\\" is not a glossy \\"ooh-rah\\" account of the Corps, nor is it an exercise in dark humor and cynicism like Anthony Swofford's \\"Jarhead.\\"  While the author is respectful to the troops, he portrays the Corps' good and bad sides, thus allowing the reader to make final judgment.  Wartime service in Iraq is described in graphic ways without a overt political agenda.  Instead, Mr. Phillips focuses on the individual Marines, and the boredom mixed with terror they deal with daily in Iraq.  For example, the devastating effects of AK-47 bullets and grenade shrapnel on the human body are intimately detailed.  In addition, the psychological trauma of PTSD is explored by documenting the dreams and involuntary reactions of Cpl. Dunham's comrades, along with the psychic toll suffered by medical personnel who endure a constant flow of badly wounded young men.  What makes these accounts so immediate is that we've gotten to know a bit about these men and women before they end up suffering physical and mental damage.  But they do their duty despite the frustration of dealing with a chameleon-like enemy in an uncertain situation.<br /><br />An interesting part of this book was the author's description of the default Marine NCO leadership style.  His purpose was to contrast it with Cpl. Dunham's approach.  I was dismayed that a number of corporals and sergeants lead with intimidation and an iron hand.  I saw and experienced that unfortunate state of affairs during my time in the Corps, and am ashamed to say I unsuccessfully imitated that dictatorial technique for a time.  One reason I chose not to reenlist (besides being RIFed after GW1) was that I knew I couldn't continue to lead in that fashion.  I'm not advocating a laissez-faire or buddy-buddy approach, but being a tyrant isn't cool either.  Cpl. Dunham's humane style of leadership should be encouraged - I would have been proud to serve under him.<br /><br />At any rate, \\"The Gift of Valor\\" is a window into the enlisted infantry ranks of the modern Marine Corps, the daily trials faced by individual Marines and naval medical personnel in Iraq, and the selfless sacrifice one man made for his fellow Marines.

One day during a powerful sermon, Mike Yankoski had a paradigm shift as a believer in Christ.  He decided that he needed to become the Christian that he claimed to be.  That epiphany evolved into a daring plan: drop out of \\"normal\\" life and live for five months as a homeless person.  After prayer and counsel, he found a kindred spirit named Sam Purvis to accompany him for safety's sake, and they did just that.  Equal parts travel journal and faith chronicle, \\"Under the Overpass\\" is their fascinating story.<br /><br />While most Christians (myself included) dream about the radical things they would *like* to do for God, Mike and Sam actually stepped out and did them.  They traveled around the US to five different cities and spent about a month in each.  They lived by their wits: panhandling, sleeping under bridges, eating discarded food, and getting to know the grungy homeless most of us dismiss as being lazy, addicts, crazy, or all three.  They also experienced the best and worst of \\"regular\\" people, Christian or not - those who went out of their way to help, along with ones who taunted them or threw them out of coffee shops and churches.<br /><br />An important aspect of this story is what it isn't: a fundie guilt-trip, ego boosting condescension, or boring theological treatise.  Instead, it's a tale of simple and real faith in action.  Mike and Sam had a humble desire to live out God's Word on the edge, and they fall back on Scripture verses and spiritual songs for succor or to reinforce a lesson learned.  Of course, there were times of discouragement, conflict (with third parties and each other), and physical misery.  But through these trials they achieved a deeper and more profound relationship with Christ, along with a genuine love for those who aren't so lovely or lovable.<br /><br />The most fascinating part of \\"Under the Overpass\\" was Mike and Sam's positive and negative encounters with others, homeless or otherwise.  It didn't take long for them to personify the external qualities we associate with street persons: dirty, smelly, and dressed in cast-off clothing.  Once that transformation took hold, every interaction changed significantly.  In addition to the usual rejections and confrontations, they received unexpected grace, often when at wit's end.  For example, both were rudely thrown off a large Phoenix church campus after they were discovered sleeping on the lawn.  Somewhat discouraged, they prayed and visited the church's service the next day in part to escape the oppressive heat.  To their surprise, the man who had previously sent them packing tearfully asked their forgiveness and revealed that he was the director of the area's homeless outreach program!  As for the homeless, they weren't depicted as \\"noble savages\\" or sad sacks with hearts of gold.  Many were enslaved to substance abuse or mentally ill, and would often harass or intimidate others to get money for their fix.  But some managed to help their fellows with food or companionship despite their own issues.  And a few claimed to know God and love Him in the midst of their addictions and problems.  Mike and Sam genuinely cared about these folks, and came to see them as equal bearers of God's image.  Friendships were formed in each location, from the colorful \\"Sugar Man\\" in Portland, Oregon, to the talented but damaged Andrew in San Diego.  And when people took time to help, or dealt with Mike and Sam as persons instead of skuzzy annoyances, the two men profoundly appreciated these demonstrations of agape love.<br /><br />Both Mike and Sam's outlook on life and faith in God were radically altered by their unique experience.  Based on Deuteronomy 8:7-11, at the journey's end they prayed that the change would stick and they would \\"never forget\\" God and His blessings.  Each has returned to his previous life, but both brought along a heart for the homeless and disenfranchised.<br /><br />Mike Yankoski has written one of the best Christian books I've read this year.  It pricked my conscience to see men living out a genuine and radical faith vs. just being OK with the \\"easy grace\\" and material benefits I take for granted.  There's also a website based on the book's title with additional information about Mike and Sam, an online forum, and resources pertaining to the homeless.  I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Under the Overpass.\\"  Read it while listening to Switchfoot's \\"The Beautiful Letdown,\\" and you may have an epiphany of your own.ooks I've read this year.

But despite this review's title (a term of endearment from one author to the other), it's a breath of fresh air.  The book's format is visually hip, with flair such as little \\"instant message\\" windows by a passage that directs the reader to other pages for supplemental info.  The authors write with a lighthearted and accessible style, and they include little sidebars with conversational commentary about the text (she's the cute doggy; he's the gorilla).<br /><br />Hayley and Michael DiMarco are a thirtysomething Christian married couple who write books about relational topics under their \\"Hungry Planet\\" publishing company (they have a couple of websites as well, including one based on \\"Marriable\\").  Their goal with this book is to take the desperation out of dating by helping the reader transform him- or herself into a \\"marriable\\" person.  They recognize dating as the culturally dominant means for achieving marriage, and unlike other Christian authors they don't disparage it as a methodology.  Hackneyed formulas for successfully snaring a mate are avoided, as is equating the practices of ancient Hebrew culture with eternal divine decree (courting, anyone?).  What truly matters is not the means, but the person's heart condition and motivation.<br /><br />\\"Marriable\\" really shines when it explores the contrasts between men and women in the context of romantic relationships.  The DiMarco's focus on the different, yet complementary, roles men and women play in relationships was illuminating.  For example, men should exercise their masculinity by pursuing and having a plan, while women need to demonstrate femininity by responding (if they actually want to date the guy) and being mysterious.  Although neither author advocates stereotypical macho or shrinking violet mentalities, they do favor a more old-fashioned ideal of male and female.  In addition, the common dating mistakes they highlighted were important.  Men can be too emotional or passive and end up being the \\"nice guy that finishes last,\\" while women have a tendency to fool themselves with \\"desperate lies\\" to maintain a bad relationship.  Plus, there's counsel on moral pitfalls, like how male pornography (skin mags and so on) and the female equivalent (romance novels and the like) damage marriable potential.  And there's even a chapter on the pluses and minuses of online dating - not surprising, since that's how the authors met.<br /><br />I did question a couple aspects of \\"Marriable.\\"  First, I was a bit wary about classifying dating as a \\"game.\\"  The authors assure us that dating should be done by \\"marriable\\" folks for the purpose of getting married.  But then they portray it as a battle of wits using coyness to avoid sex on the way to the alter.  That was a bit disconcerting.  There are many hurting people in the world who are weary of anything that smacks of manipulation.  They simply desire mutual honesty and respect.  I think a \\"dance\\" allegory would have fit their goal of \\"tempering the emotional with logic, faith, and trust\\" a bit better, since \\"game\\" has too much negative baggage.  Finally, for a Christian book there was a dearth of Biblical references.  Perhaps the authors want to reach a wider audience and avoid sounding preachy, but grounding their assertions in Scripture would have lent them more credibility.<br /><br />Despite a few minor issues there's lots of good stuff in \\"Marriable,\\" and I'd count it as a solid choice for Gen X and Y singles looking for common-sense dating guidance.

As a middle-class white-collar IT worker, I can identify with the characters in \\"Office Space\\" that distrust management and fear layoffs.  I wonder if I have the tools to handle sudden unemployment in my highly competitive (and frequently outsourced) field.  I bought \\"Bait and Switch\\" hoping for an in-depth analysis on the dark side of corporate life, and to get an idea about the rigors of job-hunting.  I found nuggets of insight, but was also disappointed for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Some parts of \\"Bait and Switch\\" resonated with me.  For example, Ms. Ehrenreich's depiction of the seamier side of job hunting was an ugly revelation.  The fact that a parasitic industry has sprung up around the unemployed, promising jobs via \\"coaching,\\" \\"image makeovers,\\" and \\"networking\\" left me dismayed.  I'm sure some are helpful, but people with dubious qualifications charging big fees for questionable services that ultimately lead to nothing are exploiters, pure and simple.  Of course, the author's observations about corporations valuing profit over employees is nothing new.  However, her angle on the eroding confidence of her fellow job seekers was intriguing.  Some had been out of work for months, or even a year or more.  It's quite a blow to be shown the gate after faithful and long-term service, and then receive constant (and often brusque) rejection by hundreds of other companies.  Also, the reliance on cheaper contract and temp workers who don't require benefits is a shady trend that highlights the US healthcare problem.  I agree with her position that healthcare should be independent of employment, along with longer-term unemployment insurance (wage insurance as recommended by Thomas Friedman in \\"The World is Flat\\" would be nice as well, but she doesn't mention that idea).  And I share her suspicions concerning the reliability of personality and aptitude tests such as the Myers-Briggs.  One such exam indicated that she wouldn't make a good writer, which is not the case.  The book is an easy read, even while walking on a treadmill.<br /><br />However, other aspects of the book don't match the writing quality.  First and foremost, her constant snide comments about Christianity and church-sponsored networking events detracted from her credibility as an objective observer.  She highlights these churches as exploiters of the unemployed, despite the fact that their gatherings appeared to be free (unlike the secular services she utilized).  Also, she read negativity, sexism, and racism into just about every comment and action by a Christian.  As a longtime believer and seminary graduate, I can vouch for the presence of flawed motives and bad theology in the Church.  But her blanket condemnation simply doesn't square with reality.  If Ms. Ehrenreich had used the same stereotypical and demeaning tone when writing about a race or gender, she'd be labeled as racist or sexist.  Second, she (by admission and documented in her ever-evolving resume) had no real work experience in the white-collar corporate world.  That flaw also diminished her observational credentials, and was probably a major reason why she didn't get hired during her yearlong search.  Third, her approach to the all-important concept of networking was quite limited.  She didn't (or couldn't, because of her incognito status) draw upon common-sense sources of job leads: family, friends, college alumni, fellow military veterans, former co-workers, and so on.  Instead, she confines herself to the nebulous world of coaching, job fairs, Internet sites, and support/networking groups.  Finally, since she never landed a job, Ms. Ehrenreich could not fulfill her intention of a \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" expose of the corporate grind.  So, we are left with some sobering insights hobbled by a narrow focus on the negative aspects of lone wolf job-hunting under an assumed identity.<br /><br />Overall, there are some good observations about white-collar job hunting and corporate insensitivity in\\"Bait and Switch.\\"  But the book is hobbled by the author's extreme bias against Christianity, lack of relevant white-collar experience, and inability to achieve her mission of getting a corporate job.

Many men are burdened with anger and fear, and harm themselves and others as a result.  Even professing Christians lash out at their loved ones, or hold their rage inside until they suffer a physical or mental breakdown.  Why are men this way?  What can the women who love them do to help?  \\"Boiling Point\\" provides answers to these questions.  It's a Christian book, but non-believers will benefit from its insights and principles, which are applicable to men regardless of their beliefs.<br /><br />This review's titular quote from Catholic priest Ted Dobson is used by Arterburn and Stoop to describe the damage done to men by the lack of a father figure. According to the authors, due to an absent or passive father boys often grow up without proper instruction on how to be a mature man.  Without that key role model, they fail to internalize male attributes during their formative years.  These boys grow up to be men who suffer from an emotional deficit that they will try to fill with possessions, achievement, and power.  But nothing can quell their sense of loss and inadequacy.  Therefore, they continue to stew in a perpetual state of anger and fear.  Add external pressures from work and family, and men are, well, at the boiling point.  At this stage, anything can cause a meltdown.  Jobs are lost because of screaming matches with the boss, and relationships are destroyed by attempts to medicate with secret addictions to sex or narcotics.  Is there a way for males to deal with their issues and become the men they want to be?<br /><br />The past can't be changed, but there's still hope in the present.  \\"Boiling Point\\" was written for women who are married to an angry, fearful man.  That's because wives are usually the victims of their husband's issues, whether emotionally or physically.  However, a man's wife is also his best hope for healing.  To this end, the authors use examples from men's lives to show women how to recognize the warning signs in her loved one.  Helpful tools are provided that will help her grasp the situation and lovingly encourage him towards wholeness.  For example, each chapter concludes with a section called \\"Think About It; Talk About It with Him,\\" which contains various types of questions geared towards this goal.  The authors admit that the positive conversational examples are best-case scenarios, so it will usually take time and patient effort to see good results.  Of course, he must ultimately desire to heal and change as well.<br /><br />Men shouldn't be put off by the book's focus towards a woman reader.  Like Secret deodorant, \\"Boiling Point\\" is strong enough for a man, even though it's made for a woman.  The authors caution men to avoid the trap of isolation, and exhort them to seek help from trained counselors and other men who can bear their burdens.  I saw myself in some of the stories, and the root causes of my anger and fear (along with my inferior responses) were clarified.  I was encouraged along the path of dealing with my past hurts and present issues instead of letting them rule me.  And the cautionary tales warned me of the consequences of not doing so.  For that, I commend the authors.<br /><br />\\"Boiling Point\\" is a necessary book for angry, fearful men and the women who love them.

I hadn't had much luck until last May, when I was browsing the English language section of an Oslo bookstore.  I was set to catch a night cruise to Copenhagen, so I needed a portable and easy read for the \\"hurry up and wait\\" periods.  When I ran across \\"I Don't Know Much About Wine...But I Know What I Like,\\" I bought it after a short perusal.  It was worth the kroner.<br /><br />Simon Woods writes well, with a cork-in-cheek British Gen-Xer tone.  The book has a visually hip vibe, with lots of different font types and sizes, along with various illustrations in the same style as the cover.  There are sections with titles such as \\"How to Taste Your Way to the Top,\\" \\"Where to Go to Find Out More,\\" and \\"What You Need Besides Bottles of Wine.\\"  Within the sections are numerous chapters that are two or three pages long.  Each chapter goes over a single topic relevant to its section.  For example,  \\"What You Need Besides Bottles of Wine\\" contains chapters such as \\"Glass Act\\" (tracking down decent wineglasses) and \\"Tools of the Trade\\" (all about corkscrews, foil-cutters, wine coolers, and more).  Although I don't drink regularly enough to consistently utilize what I learned, the knowledge will be handy when I realize my dream of a wine country adventure (Lord willing).<br /><br />There's not a lot of depth here, so if you already know your stuff \\"I Don't Know Much About Wine...\\" may be too shallow.  And if you're looking for something highbrow, keep looking.  But there's plenty of cool info for the average dabbler, and it's a good starting point for someone testing the vino before heading into deeper cellars.  If nothing else, you'll look and sound well informed at fine restaurants and wine-tasting parties.  Mr. Woods' bottom line for wine selection: \\"You are right if it tastes good to you.\\"  I can drink to that.  Cheers to the author for a fun and informative little book.e little book.	2005-08-30

Their logic is that if we love our work, then the money will follow.  However, \\"Fire Your Boss\\" takes a different tack.  Stephen M. Pollan and Mark Levine instead recommend that we work for the money, and then the love will follow.  From that foundation, they craft a career plan that they contend will lead to occupational success and personal well being.  This flies in the face of conventional wisdom, but the authors make a compelling case.<br /><br />The \\"Fire Your Boss\\" philosophy is based on the assumption that employees are disposable.  In the era of downsizing and outsourcing, the scenario of a lifetime job with a single company is history.  Therefore, becoming attached to one position, firm, or career path is futile.  With this in mind, the authors suggest that we \\"fire our boss\\" and give up a set career plan.  Once we do that, then we are free of occupational anxiety.  We can remain in our job if it provides the salary and benefits we desire, or leave it for one that does.  Indeed, they exhort that we must always be \\"fishing\\" for a better job elsewhere.  To that end, \\"Fire Your Boss\\" pushes us to continually network outside of the job, because in the authors' words, \\"no one hires a stranger.\\"  We should also be fine-tuning our own personal work plan, which is based on what we can offer to a boss.  Meeting the boss' needs is key to workplace success, the authors argue.  If you make the boss happy and ensure he or she looks good, then your position is almost bulletproof.<br /><br />On the one hand, \\"Fire Your Boss\\" crystallized my approach to work.  Most of the time I like my job as a IT technician.  Computers appeal to the cognitive side of my nature, but I wouldn't consider them my passion.  After all, work by definition is, well, work.  It's tough to be passionate about any scenario where I have to show up at a set time and provide a service or good, under penalty of dismissal for whatever reason.  In that context, even a passion can become a burden.  Self-employment carries the same consequences, because you still have to produce or starve.  In contrast, the authors indicate that a job's purpose is to provide money for needs and wants.  Personal fulfillment should be obtained outside of the workplace.  As the authors would advocate, I've used my salary to try out a number of interesting activities, such as foreign travel, motorcycling, education, and martial arts.  Without my income, none of these options would have been available to me.  Should I try to find a job in one of those areas, like the \\"love your work\\" pundits advocate?  Perhaps.  But would they still be passions when I have to do them to obtain basic needs?  I certainly don't disparage anyone who has found fulfillment and profit by doing his or her passion.  That's an appealing life circumstance.  But it doesn't work for everyone, and I appreciated the authors' alternative.<br /><br />However, I struggled with them on one major point.  Their exhortation to be constantly \\"fishing\\" for a better job strikes me as somewhat mercenary.  Yes, most jobs these days aren't secure, and it would be foolish to pass up a good opportunity.  But giving up a good job because another one looks better doesn't always pan out.  For example, a number of folks have left my company for what they saw as dream jobs.  However, they wound up coming back for their old slot (if it was available, that is).  The grass is not always greener, and it seems like they expended a lot of time and energy for little benefit.  In addition, constant job jumping would make it difficult to become vested for retirement purposes.  A detailed retirement strategy based on the \\"fishing\\" methodology would have been appreciated.  Plus, I find it hard to believe that one can \\"have a job offer always in hand.\\"  Perhaps that's possible in the clubby executive ranks, but I'm not so sure that's feasible for the rest of us drones.  Sometimes old-fashioned persistence and loyalty does pay off, even when things look better elsewhere.<br /><br />At any rate, \\"Fire Your Boss\\" provides a good counterpoint to the plethora of \\"love your work\\" books on the market.  It provides an alternative occupational strategy for folks who are suspicious of that ideology, and whose passion is anything outside of the workplace.  Even those who would like to work in their passion but are unable to do so can benefit from this book.  For those reasons, I recommend it.us drones.

US	49158850	R1BNA2VRRJR2Z3	0785209824	55594195	Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road	Books	4	49	51	N	N	Mulling "Why" vs. "How" on the open road.	I was a big fan of this book's original form, \\"Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance (PAVM),\\" when it came out in 2000.  Either way, the premise remains the same: Donald Miller and his friend Paul leave Texas in a beat-up Volkswagen van to seek their destiny in Oregon.  Along the way they experience cool places, meet interesting people, and wrestle with various life issues.  I'm a Christian who loves to travel, so I liked the combination of a literal and spiritual journey.  Five years later, Donald Miller has achieved a measure of fame by writing a couple of other Gen-X Christian bestsellers.  Perhaps that gave him the clout to pull a Stephen King and rework a previously published book into \\"Through Painted Deserts.\\"  I read somewhere that his purpose this time around was to tell the real story of how the trip went.  But there are no momentous revelations - only added flowery exposition, a new anecdote or two, and some cruder male bonding episodes (I sold my copy of \\"PAVM\\" awhile back, so I couldn't do a thorough comparison between the two).<br /><br />The somewhat lofty new title (I liked the old one better) reflects a high-minded literary bent I don't remember from the first time around.  There's a serious helping of purple prose about life, nature, and spirituality, especially in the first half or so.  It got to be a bit much at times; the writer's admonition to \\"kill your darlings\\" came to mind.  And some political comments, coupled with a favorable comparison of Northwest women vs. their Texan counterparts, indicate that he's become the Oregonian \\"granola\\" Paul accused him of being even before he got here.  Between such banter (and a tiff or two), they get serious and discuss deeper Christian guy stuff about what they want in a wife, the meaning of a God-centered life, and so on.  Within this context, Mr. Miller ruminates on Christianity's \\"why\\" answers to life vs. science's \\"how\\" answers.  It wasn't quite a Schaeffer vs. Dawkins level of internal monologue, but it was good and relevant nonetheless.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed seeing how time has affected Mr. Miller, I'm not sure why this book had to be written.  Indeed, I wish the original had been re-released instead.  Perhaps I've changed as well over five years, but there was something about his virgin effort that made a bigger impression on me.  I think those that missed the first release (which I believe is out of print) would have liked following his spiritual and literary progression from \\"PAVM\\" through \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" and \\"Searching for God Knows What.\\"  But regardless of edition, the interpersonal interactions are real, and there's gold to be mined out of the expository passages.  Plus, it was intriguing to get an outsider's description about my native region.  I still trip out on the fact that he and Paul eventually wound up in my hometown and experienced more adventures there than I ever did.<br /><br />\\"Through Painted Deserts\\" is a looking glass into a pivotal formative experience of Donald Miller's life.  If you enjoyed his other books, and would like some insights into Mr. Miller's spiritual formation, than by all means check this one out.  But get \\"PAVM\\" if you can track it down, if only to see how he was when he first started out.ologue, but it was good and relevant nonetheless. <br /> <br />Although I enjoyed seeing how time has affected Mr. Miller, I'm not sure why this book had to be written.

It's tragic that Americans live with so much fear.  Some stimuli are straightforward: the road rager on our tail, a peeper at the window, or the group of young toughs on the corner eyeballing our approach.  However, many times we ignore or minimize fear when the cause isn't obvious.  For example, we feel anxiety towards the overly friendly stranger who offers to help with the groceries, or suspect that the withdrawn coworker who mutters threats at management may mean it.  Unfortunately, we tend to disregard our fears of such people until it's too late.  In \\"The Gift of Fear,\\" the author recommends that we recognize fear for what it is: an invaluable warning tool that can save us a lot of grief - if only we'd listen to it and react properly.<br /><br />Gavin De Becker has a lot of experience with unstable and dangerous persons.  He grew up in a dysfunctional and violent home, and he credits that background with equipping him for his current profession, which is running a company that specializes in protecting \\"the world's most famous and the world's most anonymous\\" people.  He also designed a system called MOSAIC that screens threats to the U.S. Supreme Court.  \\"The Gift of Fear\\" illustrates various tactics used by predators to ensnare the unwary, such as Forced Teaming, Charm, and Persistence.  These tools are used to overcome our fear, which is based on an intuitive knowledge of what's in our best interests.  Therefore, we must recognize fear's legitimacy, even if we can't articulate the reasons behind it, and act decisively.  Mr. De Becker also provides insight into the psychological makeup of disgruntled employees, stalkers, and abusers.  Expecting them to react rationally to negotiation and restraining orders is an error of judgment (he labels judgment as \\"the great enemy of perception, and thus accurate predictions\\").  Alternatives such as a firm \\"no means no\\" stance and totally cutting off contact are explored in detail by the author.<br /><br />This is a necessary book, and it has the added bonus of being an easy (if disconcerting) read.  However, I had an issue with Mr. De Becker's way of dealing with problem employees.  In the \\"Occupational Hazards\\" chapter, he states that companies have good results with counseling troubled employees, as long as management identifies them as a problem early on.  However, he skips that angle in favor of detailing the firing process.  I find that odd, since elsewhere he laments the lack of \\"homicide prevention centers.\\"  To his credit, Mr. De Becker places the burden on parents as the greatest determiners of a child's destiny (in the chapter \\"Fear of Children\\").  However, I would have liked him to spend more time on proactive restoration for adults.  I realize that employers aren't surrogate parents, but making a difficult employee someone else's problem is the easy way out.<br /><br />The sad part of \\"The Gift of Fear\\" is it's negative indictment of men.  According to the author, men are statistically much more violent than women, and women pay the price for that tendency.  It's tragic that women have to automatically fear most men in order to protect themselves from a couple of predators.  That this book had to be written in the first place indicates that American society needs some deep healing.  Until that day comes, make sure that all female family members have a copy of \\"The Gift of Fear.\\"  As Oprah Winfrey said, \\"Every woman in America should read this book.  It could save your life one day (pg. 363).\\"<br /><br />On a lighter note, I recommend reading \\"The Gift of Fear\\" in conjunction with \\"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\\" by Malcolm Gladwell.  Mr. Gladwell deals with intuition in other areas besides the criminal, and both books provide good insight into how our mind uses emotion to clue us in on what we already know.is a necessary book, and it has the added bonus of being an easy (if disconcerting) read.

I work with quite a few women and girls at the dojo, so I was looking for a book with insights into what makes them tick as martial artists.  I ran across \\"Women in the Martial Arts,\\" and it was helpful.  Of course, I don't claim to have achieved a profound level of insight into the female condition.  But I'd like to think I'm less ignorant now than I was before reading it.<br /><br />This book is a collection of essays by high-ranking women from various styles.  Some of them document their personal journey though the martial arts.  It was disturbing that a few had experienced physical and emotional damage from abuse and other acts of violence.  As a result, they were looking for a path to empowerment, and thus discovered Tai Chi, Aikido, or another fighting style.  Just showing up to class was an act of courage for a couple of them.  And even those women without a lot of baggage had to overcome a particular hang-up, such as body acceptance or dealing with men in a physical manner.  But despite some struggles, they were able to heal and grow while gaining mastery in their particular art.  I found these autobiographical segments to be inspirational.<br /><br />Other writers focused on general aspects of the martial arts.  For example, one instructor wrote about developing the senses in order to avoid surprise attack.  Others expounded on the dynamics of women teaching women, the meaning of the black belt, and even martial arts for the disabled (written by a woman who practices and teaches Karate and Aikido out of a wheelchair).  Regardless of their slant, I was fascinated by how they came to terms with a feminine perspective towards the martial arts.  Some of the women had to overcome what they felt was a female predisposition towards passivity, especially when dealing with male students.  Others believed that the only way to succeed was by imitating male rigidity and aggressiveness.  Either way, once they discovered their power, they often became the terrors of their dojo!  At that point, they had to abandon their preconceptions and achieve a uniquely feminine balance of flexibility and ferocity, both internally and externally.<br /><br />Some readers, especially male ones, may struggle with the feminist vibe of \\"Women in the Martial Arts.\\"  Indeed, many of the authors began practicing martial arts as part of their participation in the Women's Movement during the 1970s (the book was published in 1992).  So there's a definite \\"female power\\" thread throughout these essays.  This made me wonder if the younger women in my class had different reasons for joining, along with post feminist attitudes towards their practice.  Still, there are good insights within this book for any martial artist, regardless of gender.Either way, once they discovered their power, they often became the terrors of their dojo!

I enjoy a jaded take on the corporate life as much as any cube dweller.  I figured that's what I was getting with \\"Bonjour Laziness.\\"  However, I should have checked it out a bit better before making my purchase, because it was ultimately a disappointing read.<br /><br />This is a very cynical and depressing perspective on being a wage earner.  A somewhat harsh indictment of a subject can work, but to avoid becoming an exercise in nihilism it needs two important counterpoints: 1) a sense of humor, and 2) reasonable alternatives.  Scott Adams' \\"Dilbert\\" has the former, and books like \\"The Joy of Not Working\\" by Ernie Zelinski contain the latter.  Unfortunately, \\"Bonjour Laziness\\" lacks either of these leavening qualities, and overall was a bummer (at least it was short).  A bleak outlook that culminates with bullet points on resigning oneself to a life of job-related misery doesn't really do it for me.  Even corporate slams like \\"The Office\\" and \\"Office Space\\" had happy endings.<br /><br />This book was originally published in France.  I happen to like France, and I have some great memories of interacting with the French in Paris.  Therefore, I find it hard to believe that this is their defining sense of workplace destiny.  There is a lot of history and beauty in Paris alone, and so many things to enjoy and experience either alone or with others.  If the author had contrasted her negative view of the corporate grind with a \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\" or \\"Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong\\" angle on finding happiness outside of the office, \\"Bonjour Laziness\\" would have been a better effort.<br /><br />To be fair, the author does score some zingers, and possibly provides a glimpse into French corporate culture.  Perhaps it reads better in French, and taps a Gallic sense of humor that got lost in translation to English.  But as it stands, I'd recommend saying \\"au revoir\\" to \\"Bonjour Laziness.\\"	2005-07-16

I had a Spanish roommate in seminary that chided Americans for being too uptight when it comes to sex.  The Christian book market is a prime example of this shortcoming.  I've grown weary of books that are little more than Scripture passages and \\"scared straight\\" stories about the dire consequences of moral failure.  But \\"Real Sex - The Naked Truth About Chastity\\" is a welcome exception to that trend.  It acknowledges the fact that sensual sin tends to feel good, which is why so many partake in it.  No, the author doesn't blow off the Bible or advocate immorality.  What Ms. Winner does is illustrate the truths behind the Biblical passages concerning chastity in a scholarly and thoughtful way.  She has a very adult (i.e. mature) take on the subject, although teens would benefit in a preventative and proactive sense from Ms. Winner's insights.<br /><br />Based on her writing style and literary references, Ms. Winner is obviously an intelligent and well-educated Christian woman.  She's not a super-functional guru in the cult of virginity who is so heavenly minded that she's no earthly good.  Instead, she is refreshingly honest about her weaknesses, including her brushes with fornication during her BC days and as a new believer.  However, she doesn't try to whitewash or justify her failings, nor does she engage in self-flagellation.  Instead, Ms. Winner evaluates her actions (and subsequent growth) within a Biblically based context.  She does a much better job defending the Scriptural ideal of chastity via her thoughtful approach than the shock and awe crowd does with their \\"God says it; that settles it\\" attitude.<br /><br />That doesn't mean Ms Winner forsakes the authority of the Bible.  Instead, she expands on the reasons why God would decree that fornication and adultery are sin, and why chastity is a spiritual discipline, much like fasting and prayer.  For example, adultery damages the family, which is the foundation of any community.  In addition, it creates disharmony in the larger community due to broken friendships and mistrust.  In contrast, practicing chastity benefits the community by strengthening trust and grounding relationships in love and respect.  This kind of reasoning shows the universal truths that Scripture contains, thus demonstrating it's relevance for us today.  Also, I appreciated her defense of singleness and celibacy, especially using Christ's life as an example.  As one who is still unmarried in his late thirties, I've felt more and more marginalized by the typical family-oriented church.  Ms. Winner brings this problem out of the shadows and confronts the church to appreciate its singles and tap their potential instead of shunting them off into singles' groups.<br /><br />There are a couple spots where Ms. Winner's reasoning was a bit too academic for my taste (understandable, since she's working on her Ph. D. in American religious history at Columbia).  In addition, I would have liked her to deal with chastity as it relates to homosexuality.  But these are minor complaints, and overall this is a fine and necessary work.  It's safe to say that over time she'll take a high place in the pantheon of Generation X Christian writers and thinkers.  \\"Real Sex\\" is the real thing when it comes to addressing the Christian discipline of chastity.  Bravo to Ms. Winner for her take on this controversial subject.disharmony in the larger community due to broken friendships and mistrust.

This is the third collection of the ongoing series; the first two are \\"Days Gone Bye\\" and \\"Miles Behind Us.\\"  The plot is this:  America has been overrun with cannibalistic zombies, and the few remaining human survivors struggle to hang on.  The main protagonist is Rick Grimes, a cop who awakens out of a coma (a la \\"28 Days Later\\") to this new and horrifying state of affairs.  After some close calls, he reunites with his wife and young son.  He soon becomes the leader of a group trying to find sanctuary in a world gone mad.<br /><br />In \\"Safety Behind Bars,\\" we pick up with Rick and company as they attempt to put down roots in a maximum-security prison.  Rick is certain that it will be an easily defensible home, but he hadn't reckoned on finding four living occupants  - and they aren't guards.  The two factions settle into an uneasy truce, but events conspire to bring about yet another cliffhanger confrontation (that's why I hate waiting for the next installment).<br /><br />I enjoy this series for a number of reasons.  First, it accomplishes what the creator intended: to show what happens after the typical zombie movie ends.  Robert Kirkman's desire is to follow Rick for years and watch him grow and change as a person who's trapped in an extreme situation.  Second, the story centers on what we really want to see in a good zombie yarn: how the humans react to and deal with a post-apocalyptic world.  Finally, Rick, his family, and the others are three-dimensional characters, with strengths and weaknesses that come to light under duress and create the series' bread-and-butter conflicts.  The excellent writing accomplishes these goals in an original and compelling way, and has kept me hooked on \\"The Walking Dead.\\"  In fact, when I saw this edition at a Stockholm sci-fi store, I bought it there instead of waiting until I got home (even though it cost more and I had to carry it around in my pack).  That's how much I like it.<br /><br />Some reviewers have wished for the return of the original artist who did the \\"Days Gone Bye\\" story arc.  I initially wanted that as well after comparing it to the penciling in \\"Miles Behind Us.\\"  But the current illustrator has hit his stride with \\"Safety Behind Bars,\\" and I've come to appreciate his darker and rougher style (be advised that the series is in black and white, but it really fits the tale's grim nature).  I have only two issues with this format.  The first is waiting six months for the next one.  Second, it would be cool if the letters pages from the comics were reprinted.  I guess these are the downsides of buying the collection vs. the actual series.<br /><br />Even with the zombie genre at the point of over-saturation, \\"The Walking Dead\\" stands out as an excellent character study that transcends its subject matter.  I recommend reading the first two collections before diving into this one.  Bravo to Mr. Kirkman for creating a fascinating new world.more and I had to carry it around in my pack).

I had a great time seeing the places where my predecessors came from, and I can attribute much of my trip's success to the \\"Rick Steves' Scandinavia 2005\\" guidebook.  Mr. Steves has created an excellent and portable all-in-one travel resource for this region.  It's well organized, and compact enough to fit in a jacket pocket for consultation on the fly.  But most importantly, his hotel, transportation, and attraction recommendations fit my traveling desires and saved me time and money.<br /><br />For example, finding a decent place to stay in a strange country can be daunting, but Mr. Steves' picks came through every time.  His three-tiered rating system based on pricing helped me zero in on optimal accommodations:  high (fancier hotels), moderate (nice, but no frills), and low priced (hostels and private homes).  I stuck to the moderate level, and the book led me to a good night's sleep in each city.  The City Hotel and Rainbow Hotel Astoria in Oslo, Hotel Jorgensen in Copenhagen, and Queen's Hotel in Stockholm were all great for a thirtysomething solo traveler on a budget.  They had helpful staff, good breakfasts included with the room, and locations close to transportation centers and attractions.<br /><br />Getting around Scandinavia was made easier by the hints in \\"Scandinavia 2005.\\"  Taking the night cruise from Oslo to Copenhagen got me on a cruise ship for the first time, and watching the shore slip by while enjoying a nice wine and cigar was sweet.  I also took Mr. Steves' advice and reserved a couchette on a night train from Copenhagen to Stockholm (a bit crowded with five other people in the cabin, but efficient nontheless).  Both methods enabled me to combine travel with sleep to maximize time and kroner savings.  And his admonition to rely on walking and bicycling to intimately experience the cities was smart, especially since I lost seven pounds while seeing the sights!<br /><br />Finally, Mr. Steves' ratings on things to see and do helped me dive into my Nordic roots.  He uses a zero to three triangle rating system (three triangles = don't miss; two triangles = try hard to see; one triangle = worthwhile if you can make it; no triangle = worth knowing about).

US	49158850	R20PYICW15NE2I	0805431616	460488603	Against All Odds: My Story	Books	4	85	92	N	N	A journey of faith told in three books	I enjoyed Chuck Norris's action movies when I was growing up in the 80s.  They were a pretty good diversion for a teenager intrigued by the martial arts and longing for adventure.  But eventually my interests turned elsewhere.  Twenty years later, I've been reading books by and about various martial artists.  So when I saw \\"Against All Odds\\" at a Christian bookstore, I was intrigued.  I had no idea that Chuck Norris was a God-fearing kind of guy, so I had to find out more about him.  \\"Against All Odds\\" is a Christian-themed autobiography (written with Ken Abraham) that covers Mr. Norris's life from a difficult childhood to his present day success as a martial artist, actor, and businessman.  It's an easy and interesting read (although there are way too many exclamation points).<br /><br />However, I ended up reading his other two books first.  They augmented this book and gave me a more comprehensive perspective on Mr. Norris's life journey.  \\"The Secret Power Within\\" is a 1996 self-help book advocating a Zen-based approach to living.  It contains several anecdotes from Mr. Norris's life illustrating the benefits of the Zen philosophy.  It's somewhat similar to Joe Hyams's classic book \\"Zen and the Martial Arts.\\"  The second book is Mr. Norris's prior autobiography \\"The Secret of Inner Strength,\\" written in 1988 with Joe Hyams.  The philosophical focus of \\"The Secret of Inner Strength\\" is more cognitive, based on achieving goals using positive thinking and visualization.  Each chapter ends with a couple of bullet-point principles for the reader's personal application.  In light of this newest book, I found it intriguing that a relationship with God was not a major theme in either of Mr. Norris's previous works.<br /><br />My curiosity stoked, I dove into \\"Against All Odds\\" to see how Mr. Norris got to Christ via martial arts, Zen, and positive thinking.  It's mostly a retelling of \\"The Secret of Inner Strength,\\" with some reworking and 16 years worth of additional information.  I found it interesting to compare and contrast the two autobiographical books.  He has recast some events from the first book with a Christian perspective, and also expands on other parts in light of the passage of time.  For example, Mr. Norris reveals that his first marriage was more problematic than portrayed in \\"The Secret of Inner Strength.\\"  He admits to having an affair that produced a daughter, and eventually he and Dianne divorced.  Subsequently, Mr. Norris remarried and started another family, got involved in politics, and embarked on a successful business venture with the Total Gym home workout machine.  But most importantly to him, Mr. Norris reaffirmed his relationship with Jesus Christ and became a committed Christian.  In contrast to his earlier books, he now credits God for his achievements.<br /><br />Other reviewers have given Mr. Norris a bad time about his moral failures, especially with his profession of Christianity.  He's also an unabashedly conservative Bush supporter, so Democrats might find this book tough to swallow.  But he's refreshingly honest about his shortcomings.  Mr. Norris owes up to his failures with Dianne, and seems to have made peace with his loved ones.  He has some commendable actions to his credit, such as involvement with the Make-a-Wish Foundation and his own KICKSTART program to build character in kids using the martial arts.  Perhaps there's more \\"dirt\\" waiting to be uncovered.  But I'm not willing to cast the first stone, and overall his story is an inspiring one.  Mr. Norris discovered Christ at the end of a long and winding road, and I found that to be encouraging.<br /><br />If you buy \\"Against All Odds,\\" I recommend checking out the other books mentioned above to get the \\"big picture\\" of Mr. Norris's life.

Despite the Eastern-tinged title, this is a Christian look at the Enron scandal.  Mr. Seay illuminates the flawed corporate and individual values that led Enron to disillusion loyal employees and ruin trusting investors.  He writes in an accessible and straightforward fashion, so the book is a quick read.  However, the ethical lessons he imparts should not be soon forgotten.<br /><br />Mr. Seay profiles the main Enron players and uses them as positive and negative character sketches.  For example, personal qualities that contributed to Enron's doom were Andrew Fastow's me-first mentality, Ken Lay's refusal to take responsibility, and Rebecca Mark's lust for power.  Unfortunately, some of these folks claimed to be persons of faith, but they were double-minded in their business dealings right up until the end.  That's the most disturbing aspect of the story for me, since it illustrates the fallacy and ultimate futility of compartmentalizing one's life.  However, some Enron employees did stand for what was right, even when it cost them.  One in particular was Sherron Watkins, whose detailed memo about Enron's problems was promptly ignored by Ken Lay.  She and other courageous employees sounded the moral alarm, but they were overwhelmed by superiors that lusted after money and power.  Mr. Seay portrays persons like Mrs. Watkins as virtuous examples for others facing similar moral and ethical dilemmas.<br /><br />\\"The Tao of Enron\\" is not meant to be an in-depth analysis of the Enron scandal.  Ultimately, it's a call to embrace the Biblical qualities of integrity and simplicity inside and outside of the workplace.  Mr. Seay implores Christians to avoid the materialistic trap of \\"affluenza\\" and instead live an \\"honorable and satisfying life\\" for God's glory.  There's even an appendix with common-sense suggestions for simple living.  After reading this book, I purchased \\"Smartest Guys in the Room\\" for a more detailed look at the rise and fall of Enron.  But \\"The Tao of Enron\\" stands alone as a spiritual perspective on the company's meltdown.ter reading this book, I purchased \\"Smartest Guys in the Room\\" for a more detailed look at the rise and fall of Enron.

When I was in seminary a couple years ago, my counseling teacher had to spend an extra day on marriage and relationships.  This was due to the poor results on a relational test she administered to the class.  She said that as Generations X and Y have grown up and entered seminary, the scores have gotten progressively worse!  Issues such as codependence, self-centeredness, and self-protection have become much more prevalent in the last decade or so.  Men are more passive, and women harbor father issues that taint their relations with men.  With all this relational baggage, I wonder how Christian singles manage to get married, let alone remain that way.<br /><br />Perhaps that's why there are so many Christian singles books on the market.  Christian men and women are clamoring for ways to create as much certainty as possible in the most uncertain of things: romantic relationships.  \\"Finding the Right Woman for You: One Woman's Advice to Men\\" is yet another entry into this crowded Christian genre.  However, this is one of the few books for men that's written by a woman.  As I can attest, guys tend to be somewhat clueless about what makes women tick.  Michelle Hammond, a prolific writer on singleness, provides sisterly advice for men seeking a mate.  She has opened a window into femininity and revealed what's going on in a woman's heart.  I appreciated her insights into what women of character are looking for in a man.  I was also encouraged by the candor she displayed about her own struggles as a single.<br /><br />Ms. Hammond uses the Old Testament book of Ruth to illustrate what men need to know about women and how to woo them.  For example, a man should look for a woman who demonstrates Ruth's \\"Five C's\\": Clear, Caring, Committed, Consistent, and Complete.  Boaz is held up as a character example for men to emulate so they are worthy of a woman like Ruth.  Supplementing each chapter are sections titled \\"The Facts on Women,\\" with bullet points that reveal a woman's inner workings, desires, fears, motivations, and expectations when it comes to men.  In addition, there are challenging \\"Consider This\\" questions, such as \\"How are you preparing yourself for marriage?\\" and \\"How will you be a blessing to a woman?\\"  A running theme throughout this book is that men need to exemplify Proverbs 1-30 to deserve a Proverbs 31 woman.<br /><br />Certain women may be upset that Ms. Hammond has given away their \\"secrets\\" and exposed them to potential manipulation by a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Yes, Ms. Hammond does reveal the vulnerabilities of a woman's heart.  But males should be good stewards of this knowledge and \\"play the man,\\" treating women as \\"sisters and mothers\\" instead of objects and hormonal outlets.  \\"Finding the Right Woman for You\\" is welcome advice to Christian men from a sistah who is for the mistahs.man's inner workings, desires, fears, motivations, and expectations when it comes to men.

I wanted to get more background on this issue, and I discovered \\"Critical Condition.\\"  I found it to be readable, and it illuminated a number of healthcare crisis points.  If you've ever read \\"The Rainmaker\\" by John Grisham, you'll have some idea of the stories this book contains.  Free market healthcare was touted as the best possible way to ensure low prices and good treatment via competition (oddly enough, by the same guy who came up with the \\"body count\\" progress-measurement system in Vietnam.).  But the authors contend it has led to higher costs, inferior care, and an uninsured class where millions are only an illness or accident away from financial ruin.  And to top it off, the insurance companies have taken away patient care decision-making away from the doctors.  I've seen and experienced some of the issues highlighted in \\"Critical Condition,\\" and I'm appalled that a so-called \\"hyperpower\\" has a health care system where families must conduct bake sales to cover medical bills.  I commend the authors for illustrating this problem in layman's terms.<br /><br />However, they aren't so clear when it comes to a solution, and a couple of points stand out.  First, the authors criticize efforts to speed up the introduction of new medicines.  They argue that some drug companies do this to make a quick buck at the expense of patients.  Perhaps they have a point, but on the other hand those with terminal cancer or AIDS have pushed for quicker drug introduction because their lives are on the line.  Don't people in this category deserve to take a chance that may save them, especially if they have nothing to lose and everything to gain?  Second, they argue for a standard IT system to ease the exchange of medical information.  As a healthcare IT tech, I'd love that (although I'd probably end up outsourced as a result).  But how?  Ideally, you'd have to standardize applications (healthcare and otherwise), hardware platforms, operating systems, etc.  Healthcare is a huge information technology market.  Can you imagine the joy in Redmond if all US hospital computers had to use Windows XP and Microsoft Office?  The Linux folks would blow a gasket, and we'd probably see another Microsoft antitrust suit.  And what of the other complex legalities involved?  Where I work, conflict of interest barriers have prevented us from linking our computer network with other health systems.  \\"Critical Condition\\" doesn't address this type of hurdle, or even how HIPAA figures into their ideal information sharing process.  Finally, there wasn't much detail on how a single-payer gov't system would be funded, especially with the costs generated by an aging population and illegal immigration.  For two guys who go on about how drug companies skip over negative side effects, they should've spent more time on the T-A-X issue and its repercussions.  A bullet point or two just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Ultimately, Mr. Barlett and Mr. Steele argue that only the federal gov't has the power to dismantle the current massive for-profit healthcare bureaucracy and create a single point of accessible healthcare (although they don't touch on the resulting fallout of job losses this paradigm shift would create).  Even so, I would have appreciated some insight into an existing foreign gov't-run healthcare system they favor.  They allude to the French and Canadian programs, but offer no breakdown of why or how their systems are superior (or possibly inferior) to ours.  But despite their assertions, the authors reject a single-payer U.S. gov't run health plan as politically impossible.  Instead, they call for a Federal Reserve-type quasi-gov't system to create a single health care entity (a bit ironic, given the book's anti-market theme.  And how can it be \\"quasigovernmental?\\"  I confess I don't quite grasp the nuances involved here.).  I can buy into that avenue of approach, as long as this agency has the power to provide good, affordable care to everyone, create a manageable bureaucracy, and enforce patient and doctor-centric healthcare laws.  Easier said than done, however.  If the Clintons couldn't reform our health care system during their eight years in office, and the Republicans don't seem to see reformation as a big priority, then how will positive change occur?<br /><br />There are countless historical examples of the Biblical admonition that \\"the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.\\"  Free market healthcare has created an environment where it's too easy for this weakness in human nature to overwhelm the altruistic focus of medicine.  \\"Critical Condition\\" admirably illustrates this problem, but a more comprehensive analysis and realistic solution will have to be found elsewhere.fordable care to everyone, create a manageable bureaucracy, and enforce patient and doctor-centric healthcare laws.

To be a well-rounded Sensei, I must continually grow in knowledge as well as technique.  To that end, I've been reading a number of books about the martial arts.  One part of that genre are the autobiographical accounts of Budo practitioners.  I want to gain deeper insight through what others have experienced, learned, and how they changed as a result of martial arts training.  \\"Iron and Silk\\" is one such tale, written by a man who studied Kung Fu in the USA during the 70s and Wushu in China during the 80s. At a young age, Mark Salzman developed a deep appreciation for Chinese culture, martial arts included (as documented in his other fine non-fiction book \\"Lost in Place\\").  \\"Iron and Silk\\" chronicles Mr. Salzman's adventures during a two-year stint as an English teacher in China.  This book is an easy and fun read, a testament to Mr. Salzman's excellent, flowing writing style and storytelling ability.<br /><br />Mark Salzman is probably one of the most unique and resourceful contemporary individuals I've had the pleasure to read about.  He's always ready to try something new, or step out and build relationships with total strangers.  Even during adolescence, his passion for learning, combined with a good work ethic, created many possibilities.  His youthful fascination with Chinese culture led to acceptance at Yale, where he majored in Chinese literature.  While there, he mastered Mandarin Chinese, which opened a unique door.  Despite his obsession with all things Chinese, he had no desire to see China.  But in his words, he \\"did need a job,\\" so he applied for and got a position teaching English at Hunan Medical College in Changsha.  Funny how great experiences can come from such pragmatic decisions.<br /><br />I should state that Mr. Salzman has a somewhat different perspective on the martial arts compared to, say, C.W. Nicol or Robert Twigger.  Yes, he shares their fascination with the Budo.  But instead of being an all-consuming focus, the fighting arts are just one part of Mr. Salzman's multifaceted life.  I wouldn't call him a dilettante, but he didn't seem to have the same level of passion towards the martial Way that the other two men possessed.  For example, Mr. Salzman obtains Wushu tutelage from some talented (and even famous) Chinese instructors.  However, he isn't on a quest to tame his inner rage (Sensei Nicol), prove himself as a man (Mr. Twigger), or even earn a black belt.  Mr. Salzman appears to already possess a solid sense of self, so Wushu is merely another interest.  Instead of being a high-stakes means to an urgently desired end, Wushu is one of many activities he enjoys and learns from, like playing the cello, learning Chinese calligraphy, and simply getting to know the Chinese themselves.  If I had any issue with \\"Iron and Silk,\\" it was the absence of any overt character flaws on the part of Mr. Salzman, along with his ability to do just about everything well.  Indeed, the Chinese nicknamed him \\"Huoshenxian\\" - an immortal in human form - because he was so \\"different,\\" and made people happy all of the time.  I guess I wish I was more like him, or at least knew more people created in his mold.<br /><br />At any rate, the implied benefit of being centered and having an eclectic approach to life is a running theme in \\"Iron and Silk.\\"  Along those lines, it's more Chinese travelogue than serious immersion into martial arts study.  Travel gets me out of my normal introverted shell, and Mr. Salzman's adventures remind me how much I enjoy that practice.  He built many interesting relationships just by being open to possibility and respectful towards the various Chinese he encountered.  Of course, the Communist government during that period was somewhat of an obstacle, but in most cases he was able to get around them quite nicely, often in a humorous and good-natured manner.<br /><br />I read \\"Iron and Silk\\" in conjunction with \\"Angry White Pyjamas\\" by Robert Twigger and \\"Moving Zen\\" by C.W. Nicol to get multiple perspectives on martial arts training.  It's interesting to compare and contrast Mr. Salzman's 70s and 80s presuppositions and experiences with those of Sensei Nicol in the early 60s and Mr Twigger in the 90s.  Each book is a fascinating snapshot of a particular era, culture, and martial art style (Wushu, Aikido, and Karate).  But despite their different philosophies, motivations, and levels of immersion, all of these men achieved personal growth and maturation through persevering within the martial arts.  I found that to be inspiring, and so I recommend all three books (along with \\"Lost in Place\\" for insight into Mr. Salzman's formative years).o get multiple perspectives on martial arts training.

An issue I have with some churches is their emphasis on program-driven ministry.  Sometimes the congregation is little more than a tool for realizing the pastorate's vision.  Of course, it's a good thing when the laity serve in their church's ministries.  In addition to ensuring their house of worship's fruitful existence, it gives them a chance to explore different ways to serve God.  And if they find their niche, everyone benefits.  But when a church member feels called to serve in (or start an) external ministry, leadership may feel threatened.  A self-protective pastor might even take offense (\\"Is she really saying my church isn't good enough for her?\\").  So at best she may get a half-hearted send-off; at worst she's criticized for being divisive.  It seems contradictory to church growth principles for pastors to encourage a layperson's external calling, kind of like a Macy's employee sending a paying customer to Gimbal's.<br /><br />Certain churches have a body-count mindset, so they don't encourage members with an external ministry vision.  As a result, folks ignore their personal callings and passions in favor of whatever church programs need a warm body.  Some even think it's \\"spiritual\\" to fill an ill-fitting role.  That kind of martyr complex may drive a curmudgeonly bachelor into the always-needy children's ministry, but eventually he will succumb to disillusionment and burnout.  So how can a layperson find their passionate calling?  That's the welcome theme of \\"When There's No Burning Bush (WTNBB).\\"  The authors recognize that the laity have their own unique part to play in God's kingdom.  To that end, their personal callings, passions, and giftings should be identified and nurtured toward fruition.  As a result, everyone realizes their individual purpose within the Body of Christ, whether inside or outside a particular church.<br /><br />To break down ministry barriers, the authors explore and debunk six ministry myths, such as \\"Most Real Ministry Happens at Church,\\" \\"Ministry is for 'Ministers',\\" and \\"Good Christians Never Say 'No'.\\"  Encouraging stories of people taking ministry risks and finally experiencing fulfilling, passionate Christian service are told throughout \\"WTNBB.\\"  Many of them were confused, unhappy, and used up, despite being involved in otherwise successful ministries.  But then they thought \\"outside the box,\\" stepped out to embrace their true calling, and everything changed.  I loved reading about the moment when their hoped-for ministry dreams became a joyous reality.  I could almost see their burdens fall away and countenances lighten, especially when their pastors helped and encouraged them.  Unfortunately, in some cases leadership was more hindrance than help.  But the authors claim that more and more churches are working to empower the laity's external ministry aspirations, and hopefully that trend will continue.<br /><br />I certainly don't intend to demonize pastors or minimize the need for laity to serve in their particular church.  To be fair, pastors usually have good intentions, and are sincerely seeking to be Godly servant leaders.  As for churches, they need a serving laity to survive and prosper.  Indeed, many discover their specific calling within its walls.  But a church's existence and growth shouldn't be at the expense of the layperson's true passion and calling.  Too often, an individual member's fires are quenched in favor of the corporate church's flame.  Sometimes needs must be met for a period, but being made to serve out of guilt or obligation is not the heart of God.  I commend the authors for writing a book that will empower the layperson towards realizing his or her unique passion and calling for service, wherever that may lead.  It would be great if \\"WTNBB\\" inspires their pastors to help them along the way.h,\\" \\"Ministry is for 'Ministers',\\" and \\"Good Christians Never Say 'No'.\\"  Encouraging stories of people taking ministry risks and finally experiencing fulfilling, passionate Christian service are told throughout \\"WTNBB.\\"  Many of them were confused, unhappy, and used up, despite being involved in otherwise successful ministries.

Robert Twigger, a disaffected thirtysomething teaching English to Tokyo high school girls, decides that he is incomplete as a man without some sort of physical challenge.  Martial arts training appears to fit the bill, so he and his two expiate roommates enroll in a local aikido dojo.  While taking regular classes, Mr. Twigger is drawn to the dojo's toughest mode of aikido instruction: an intense yearlong course normally taken by Japanese Kidotai (riot police) as a job requirement.  Despite his initial misgivings and warnings from others about the course's difficulty, he goes for it and resolves to finish no matter what.  \\"Angry White Pyjamas\\" chronicles Mr. Twigger's struggle to prove himself by successfully completing the Kidotai Aikido course.<br /><br />Mr. Twigger makes many observations about his life and Japanese culture both in and out of the dojo, so there's lots of exposition compared to, say, \\"Moving Zen\\" by C.W. Nicol.  Also unlike Sensei Nicol, Mr. Twigger is not wholeheartedly enraptured by Japanese culture.  He has a more postmodern viewpoint, so his anecdotes are not filtered through rose-colored glasses.  But humor leavens much of his story, and there's no disrespect or Western condescension.  As one who was stationed in mainland Japan from '88 to '90, I enjoyed the reminders his recollections provoked  (funky food, navigating the extensive train system, hanging out in Roppongi, etc.).  Mr. Twigger also makes the other folks he encounters come alive through his writing; his slacker roommates Fat Frank and Chris are particularly priceless.  But the most interesting aspect of \\"Angry White Pyjamas\\" is Mr. Twigger's search for validation as a male through overcoming adversity.  He reminded me of an \\"Iron John\\" or \\"Wild at Heart\\" kind of guy, looking for affirmation of his masculinity via completion of the brutal riot police course.  As a former Marine and current martial artist, I identified and sympathized with his quest.  The course was a rite of passage for Mr. Twigger, and I rooted for him every step of the way.  Many times he came close to quitting due to constant pain, injuries, fatigue, interpersonal conflicts, and his own perceived ineptitude with aikido.  But despite these hardships he didn't give up, and for that I commend and respect him.<br /><br />I read \\"Angry White Pyjamas\\" in conjunction with \\"Iron and Silk\\" by Mark Salzman and \\"Moving Zen\\" by C.W. Nicol to get multiple perspectives on martial arts training.  It's interesting to compare and contrast Mr. Twigger's 90s presuppositions and experiences with those of Mr. Salzman's in the 80s and Sensei Nicol's in the early 60s.  Each book is a fascinating snapshot of a particular era, culture, and martial art style (Aikido, Wushu, and Karate).

As a newly minted ShoDan in Shiho Karano Karate, I have to be skilled in knowledge as well as technique.  To that end, I've been reading a number of books on various aspects of the martial arts.  One part of that genre are the autobiographical accounts of Budo practitioners.  I want to gain deeper insight into my own path through what others have experienced, learned, and how they changed as a result of their martial arts training.  \\"Moving Zen\\" is one such tale, written by a Welshman who rose to black belt level in Japan during the early 60s.  C. W. Nicol, an adventurous twentysomething, decided to immerse himself in the study of Karate.  So he moved to Japan and began training at the Yotsuya dojo in Tokyo.  \\"Moving Zen\\" chronicles the two-year period where Sensei Nicol progressed from a brawny and temperamental white belt to a skilled and calm first-degree black belt.  First released in 1975, this newer small-sized edition includes an afterword written by the author in 2001, plus some vintage photographs and simple pencil illustrations.<br /><br />Sensei Nicol writes with a very pure and austere style, so \\"Moving Zen\\" is a fairly quick read.  There's not a lot of detailed exposition, although at times he tends to wax eloquent about the spiritual aspects of Nippon, particularly Zen within Karate (hence the title).  Sensei Nicol is quite taken with Japanese culture, so you won't see much Western cynicism or skepticism here.  Instead, he \\"went native,\\" marrying a Japanese woman and eventually becoming a citizen of Japan.  Of course, Sensei Nicol has his share of trials both in and out of the dojo, due to his hot temper and, ironically, being a gaijin (foreigner) in the somewhat xenophobic society he loves.  But his respect, perseverance, and eagerness to learn Karate impress his Sensei and Sempai (not to mention his neighbors), so he eventually wins over even the hard cases.  As his studies continue, Sensei Nicol slowly but surely matures and comes to grips with his penchant for \\"impetuous courage.\\"  Despite some slips that would've probably landed him in jail over here, he learns to calm his inner rage and become more tranquil.  Indeed, the inner workings of Karate upon his spirit (vs. external fighting ability) become the most precious aspect of the martial arts to him.<br /><br />I was humbled by Sensei Nicol's unswerving determination and dedication, as well as the harsh training he endured and blossomed under as a Karateka in Japan.  One would have to really love the martial arts to deal with the ascetic military-style discipline, exacting technical requirements, and physical pain meted out by Sensei Nicol's superiors.  He even had to commute three hours a day(!) via train to his dojo.  I'm not sure I'd want to endure all that, although I got a small taste of it as a young Marine under a Japanese Sensei in Yokosuka, Japan.  He never abused us, but we sparred full contact (with pads) and performed some extreme exercises, like doing wheelbarrows on our bare knuckles up and down the gym floor.  I haven't seen many American dojos that hardcore, including my own.  I stand by my current school, but I sometimes miss the intense level of training I had in Japan.<br /><br />I read \\"Moving Zen\\" in conjunction with \\"Iron and Silk\\" by Mark Salzman and \\"Angry White Pyjamas\\" by Robert Twigger to get multiple perspectives on martial arts training.

I wanted quality materials, so I took my time and searched for works by legitimate practitioners.  One book I skimmed through was \\"Traditions\\", and after reading some chapters decided it was worthwhile.<br /><br />I discovered that Sensei Lowry has been writing about the martial arts for more than twenty years.  He's been a longtime contributor to various magazines, and has authored a number of books as well  (after finishing this one, I ordered three of his other books from Amazon).  In addition, he began practicing the martial arts back in the late sixties, so he's seen and experienced a lot in the intervening years.  \\"Traditions\\" is a collection of excellent essays that reflect his hard-earned and well-learned budo lessons.<br /><br />\\"Traditions\\" is well written, and each short chapter clearly reveals many crucial martial arts insights.  Indeed, even a non-practitioner would find it to be an accessible introduction to the martial Way.  As for budo participants, anyone from white belt to seasoned veteran will learn something new or gain a different perspective on what they already know.  Topics include proper etiquette between sempai and kohai, thoughts on learning, the reason martial artists practice barefoot, and the \\"why\\" behind the kiai.  Sprinkled throughout the book are tales of legendary Japanese bugeisha that demonstrate important budo principles and character qualities.<br /><br />Now that I've passed my ShoDan exam, I'm particularly impressed by one of Sensei Lowry's quotes: \\"When you get a black belt ranking it doesn't mean you've gotten a foot in the door.  It means you have learned how to find the doorknob (pg. 144).\\"  I'm glad that the black belt is a beginning instead of an end.  This is the kind of martial arts wisdom that you'll find in \\"Transitions.\\"  If you're serious about growing in budo knowledge as well as technique, then this book will help you along that path.ng in budo knowledge as well as technique, then this book will help you along that path.	2004-12-11

First was competing in a local tournament, where things got a bit out of control in the sparring ring.  The second was my Shihan's announcement that I'm up for possible promotion to Shodan (1st degree black belt).  Both events jolted me out of my comfort zone, and I knew I needed to reassess where I was at as a martial arts practitioner.<br /><br />I began to study some of my Soke's writings, and also looked for works by other senior martial artists.  However, my goal was not to master secret techniques or win tournament sparring in 7 easy steps.  Instead, I sought out writers who dealt with the philosophical underpinnings of the martial arts.  I wanted to explore the \\"why\\" behind the \\"what.\\"  \\"The Martial Way and its Virtues\\" grabbed my eye, and it was an excellent beginning to my quest.<br /><br />For full disclosure, I'm a Christian practicing in a Christian dojo.  That means my ultimate master is Jesus Christ, and my beliefs, presuppositions, morals, and so on rest upon the Bible.  For those who may fret about that, or think Christianity and martial arts don't mix, be assured that this book does not have a Christian bent.  Indeed, Sensei Chu draws from such diverse sources as Confucius, Soren Kierkegaard and Carlos Castaneda to make his points.  However, my particular style is Shiho Karano, and a key aspect is that we have an open approach to knowledge and learn from all.<br /><br />It was with that attitude I read \\"The Martial Way,\\" and I was not disappointed.  Sensei Chu writes using a clear and accessible style.  The book is organized into three parts that respectively deal with philosophy, strategy and technique, and spirituality.  Smaller sections flesh out each part, and titles such as \\"Lose Your Ego\\" and \\"Practice Real Life\\" indicate the specific focus.  Overall, Sensei Chu wants his book to serve as \\"a call to practicing martial artists everywhere and to aspirants of the martial Way (page 3).\\"  His guiding philosophy is \\"Tao De Gung,\\" the pure essence of the martial arts.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me was Sensei Chu's take on Shodan promotion.  He indicates there are two paths a newly minted Shodan can choose.  One is the \\"beginning of the end,\\" usually taken by those whose main purpose was earning the black belt.  They have reached their goal, and therefore leave the martial arts and go on to the next thing.  But there's a second path as well, called the \\"end of the beginning.\\"  Here, the Shodan realizes he is just starting a lifelong quest towards a deeper life in the martial Way.  That person maintains a \\"beginner's mind\\", and humbly acknowledges that he will always be a student who learns just as much (or more) by teaching as by doing.  That's how I'd like to be.f the martial Way (page 3).\\"  His guiding philosophy is \\"Tao De Gung,\\" the pure essence of the martial arts.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me was Sensei Chu's take on Shodan promotion.

But it's also important to have an idea of what other religions teach as well, if only for facilitating respectful dialogue with those of different beliefs.  With the plethora of resources available, there's no excuse for ignorance in this regard.  However, it can be tough enough mastering Christian doctrines, much less trying to learn tenets of other faiths.  \\"Understanding the Koran\\" is a welcome help in that regard (please keep in mind that it's written with a Christian slant, as you've probably guessed).<br /><br />The author discusses some surprising and relevant facts about the Koran.  For example, he reveals how the standard version of the Koran was decided upon more for political than religious reasons.  As for doctrinal issues, he spotlights Koranic vs. Biblical views of God (one God/one person vs. one God/three persons) and Jesus (human prophet vs. fully human/fully God savior/intercessor).  That was particularly interesting to me, since some claim that all religions point to the same God.  If so, then how can two of the world's largest religions differ concerning His nature, character, and how we must relate to Him?  Perhaps a choice must be made - one that has both earthly and eternal consequences.<br /><br />At any rate, some of the critiques he uses on the Koran's origin and canonization have also been leveled against the Bible (just ask the \\"Gospel of Thomas\\" advocates, or any skeptic).  However, the author doesn't really acknowledge those issues.  I would have appreciated seeing the two compared and contrasted, especially how the Bible's creation and compilation stacks up to that of the Koran.  But that path would've necessitated a much larger book, so I respect his choice to limit this one's scope.  Other sources will be necessary to gain those insights (which isn't a bad thing).<br /><br />\\"Understanding the Koran\\" is a basic, readable introduction to the Islamic holy book, and a good jumping-off point for further study. Christians must become more informed about the Koran and Islam, especially after the events of 9/11.  Indeed, there are Koranic passages that accord respect to Jesus Christ and those who follow Him.  We should do no less towards Muslims, even while standing for Jesus and the Trinity.slamic holy book, and a good jumping-off point for further study.

Recently, I skimmed through Ms. Lawler's other \\"Dojo Wisdom\\" book, and found her insights interesting.  When I saw that she'd combined two of my favorite subjects in this book, I had to have it for my writing library.<br /><br />There's lots of useful and encouraging advice for aspiring writers, or more experienced ones who might need some positive reinforcement.  The martial arts flavor will be more relevant to an actual practitioner, but the underlying principles won't be lost on those whose closest brush with martial arts is a Bruce Lee movie.<br /><br />The chapters are short, and come with practical exercises geared towards realizing whatever point she's making.  I particularly liked being able to quickly find a particular topic via the table of contents.  For example, if I'm self-conscious and suspect that I have no business writing at all, I can come to my senses on page 60.  Need a nudge to persevere and actually get that short story published?  Turn to page 22 for a gut check.  There are 98 more chapters that counter just about any excuse not to write.<br /><br />\\"Dojo Wisdom for Writers\\" belongs with a writer's other books on the craft.  We all need to be challenged and encouraged at times, and this little book packs a powerful punch in that regard.	2004-10-09

He and Davy enjoyed one of the most unique and intimate matrimonial relationships that I know of, Christian or secular.  Unfortunately, he lost his beloved to a mysterious illness after only seventeen years of marriage.  \\"Under the Mercy\\" is the sequel to \\"A Severe Mercy,\\" and it's the chronicle of his life from Davy's death in mid-century to his Catholic conversion in the early 1980s.<br /><br />\\"Under the Mercy\\" recaps some of \\"A Severe Mercy\\" to brief those who haven't read it.  But I'd recommend checking out \\"A Severe Mercy\\" first so you can appreciate where Mr. Vanauken's coming from.  Indeed, his life as documented in both books is quite fascinating.  I enjoyed reading how his relationship to God, along with his presuppositions, are refined or altered throughout the years.  He also includes some excellent essays on topics ranging from women's lib to a Turtledoveish look at a Southern victory in the Civil War.  His gradual shift from the Anglican Church into the Catholic tradition is quite intriguing as well, especially since the writings of C. S. Lewis influenced his decision.  Overall, I found his sense of grace and humor to be exemplary.  He is a true gentleman in an age where few can claim that title.<br /><br />However, Mr. Vanauken works out his salvation in ways that might tweak some conservative readers.  For example, his experimentation with pot and LSD in the sixties won't win him many points with many in the Dobson crowd.  He also demonstrated against the Vietnam War, albeit in a peaceful and reasonable fashion.  But for those who have issues with Mr. Vanauken's actions, who among us is able to cast the first stone?  He did serve as a naval officer during WWII, and was in Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941.  Also, all through his life he displayed compassion and grace towards friends, students, and others who crossed his path.  That, combined with his formidable intellect, enabled him to touch the lives of a great many people.  The two \\"Mercy\\" books are the most visible examples of his godly character.<br /><br />I admit I do struggle with some of his theological conclusions.  For example, his rationale for converting to Catholicism implies that Protestantism is a form of rebellion against God's true Church.  But overall, I respect Mr. Vanauken and consider his life to be an inspiring Christian witness.

A former engineer, Mr. Zelinski dropped out of the corporate rat race in favor of \\"The Life of Riley.\\"  He does what he loves (consulting, speaking, and writing) to make a living, and indulges in leisure the rest of the time.  That doesn't mean he loafs around all day watching TV or playing video games.  He discourages such empty distractions in favor of well-rounded activities like learning another language and volunteering at a homeless shelter.<br /><br />Mr. Zelinski makes an excellent case for living a full life free of regret.  I liked his positive attitude and constant motivation towards discovering and embracing my passions.  His examples of persons who left a dreary job in favor of pursuing their dream occupation might be just the prodding some folks need to make their own leap (a similar book had that effect on me, and earned my eternal gratitude).  Overall, the book's lighthearted tone and numerous applicable quotes were uplifting, and every chapter brightened up a break or lunchtime at work (although displaying a book with this title on your desk might upset a Bill Lumbergh-type manager).  My favorite part was his short section on becoming an author.  Every aspiring or discouraged writer should keep it handy as a pick-me-up.<br /><br />However, the Life of Riley is a subjective thing, and finding your version of it might take some time and testing.  Yes, it would be ideal to immediately discover and make a living in one's passion twenty hours a week.  However, it may take awhile to actually discern your calling and develop it into a viable occupation.  Until then, having a decent job that provides time and funds for investigating potential passions off-hours doesn't suck.  Indeed, that place in life can serve as a transitional period to test the waters while preparing for the risk of a deeper plunge.  But if the thought of showing up to work makes you want to take a hostage, then it's time to jump ship right now.  From experience, I can second Mr Zelinski's claim that it's worth it in the long run.<br /><br />Unfortunately, anyone who's not Western and single might find the Life of Riley difficult to achieve.  I'm an American singleton, so I have the luxury of finding myself without having to worry about supporting a family, where my next meal is coming from, or if another car bomb will explode in my neighborhood this month.  I doubt that a minimum-wage earner with a spouse and two young kids to feed or a woman who lives in Iraq would be able to imitate Mr Zelinki's lifestyle.  Perhaps in those situations the Life of Riley will need to be redefined.<br /><br />At any rate, \\"The Joy of Not Working\\" is a great read that provides a much-needed reality check for the average 9-to-5 person.  FYI: I've checked out a couple of Mr. Zelinski's other books, and there's some repetition between them. For example, this one and \\"How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free\\" are different in focus, but often similar in content.

When I heard that this new release was a \\"restored\\" version of the tale, I figured it was time to revisit it.  As Mr. Haldeman explains in the forward, he was forced to cut the original draft's middle section because it was too dark.  He was finally allowed by the publisher to reinsert it for this edition to create the definitive version of \\"The Forever War.\\"<br /><br />For me, \\"The Forever War\\" works primarily on a character level.  I like William Mandella as a person, especially within the context of his relationship to Marygay.  Indeed, that's why I'm glad Mr. Haldeman got to add the missing middle section.  It establishes a greater bond between them that clarifies why they are so attached to each other.  Mandella also reminds me of the main protagonist in \\"Starship Troopers\\", an everyman caught up in extraordinary events who rises to the occasion.  The time displacement angle and resulting sociological changes are also intriguing, and serve as an obvious demonstration of the alienation combat veterans feel towards the civilians who remain safe and sound back in the \\"world.\\"<br /><br />As for the titular conflict, I found it less satisfying.  The Taurans aren't an effective villain or fearsome enemy like Heinlein's Bugs.  They seem lethargic, or even befuddled, about the whole thing.  Perhaps I expected a more determined Vietcong-style enemy from what's supposed to be a Vietnam allegory.  But there are signs that Haldeman's ultimate villain is the war-hungry Earth government, desperate to inspire unity, save a faltering economy, and exert control via interstellar conflict.  Given Mr. Haldeman's status as a somewhat disillusioned baby-boomer Vietnam veteran, that makes sense.  Heck, I'm surprised that John Kerry hasn't appropriated the book for his campaign.<br /><br />In all, \\"The Forever War\\" is a worthy read, and deserves its status as classic science fiction.  Perhaps a visit from Frank Herbert or Robert Heinlein's muse would have enabled Mr. Haldeman to flesh things out a bit, but such a desire is unfair on my part.  If you're a military sci-fi buff, \\"The Forever War\\" stands well enough on its own.k Herbert or Robert Heinlein's muse would have enabled Mr. Haldeman to flesh things out a bit, but such a desire is unfair on my part.

These questions and many others are answered in &quot;A Love Observed.&quot;  For those of you who've seen &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, the cinematic tale of their courtship and marriage, Mr. Dorsett's book provides the back-story behind the film (and takes certain parts of it to task).  We are finally given a definitive look at the woman who challenged Lewis' mind and won his heart.<br />Joy Davidman was an exceptional person.  She overcame various physical, racial, and gender barriers to become a noted published author in her own right.  But the greatest leap she made was becoming a Christian.  Joy intellectually struggled against God for years, but at the age of thirty-one her resistance crumbled, and in her words He &quot;came in, and I changed (pg. 60).&quot;  After that, there was no turning back.  Eventually she pursued and caught the eye of C. S. Lewis, and the rest, as they say, is history.  Of course, there were difficulties.  Her brash American mannerisms and straightforward personality were difficult for Lewis' friends to accept at first, and there was a bit of scandal surrounding his marriage to a divorcee.  But by all appearances they loved each other, and there's no evidence that Lewis regretted marrying her.<br />&quot;A Love Observed&quot; is a fascinating glimpse into how a brilliant, strong-willed woman came to Christ and ended up marrying arguably the greatest modern Christian apologist.  It's a bittersweet story because of her untimely death, but the intense, intimate love they shared despite her illness is encouraging in a world full of self-centered, disposable relationships.  I'd recommend this book to anyone whose intellect is a barrier to faith in God, or who may be struggling with a loved one's physical problems.<br />Another excellent true Christian love story you shouldn't miss is &quot;A Severe Mercy&quot; by Sheldon Vanauken, a friend of C. S. Lewis.  Its non-romantic sequel, &quot;Under the Mercy&quot; is quite fascinating in its own right as well.k to anyone whose intellect is a barrier to faith in God, or who may be struggling with a loved one's physical problems.<br />Another excellent true Christian love story you shouldn't miss is &quot;A Severe Mercy&quot; by Sheldon Vanauken, a friend of C.

I was pleased to discover that &quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot; was as good as its predecessor.  Mr. Miller's writing style is accessible, and he comes clean in a vulnerable, candid way about his struggles with Christianity.  When I'm reading &quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot;, I feel like I'm hanging out with him in a bohemian 23rd Avenue cafe, talking about deep spiritual matters over a hot vanilla latte.<br />A reviewer listed on the back cover compares &quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot; to Anne Lamott's &quot;Traveling Mercies&quot; (which I'm currently enjoying as well), and I agree with that assessment.  Each book chronicles the author's spiritual quest to comprehend the transcendent God they love and make sense of the temporal world they live in, all while striving to discover their destiny.  I love it when Christians get together and hash out the unique aspects of working out their salvation with fear and trembling.  That's how we grow, bear each other's burdens, and become more Christ-like.  Books like Anne and Donald's are the next best alternative.<br />&quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot; is much more immediate for me because it's set in the region I call home:  the Pacific Northwest, specifically Portland, Oregon.  Don writes about people I know of (Tony the Beat Poet and Mark the Cussing Pastor), and places I've been (Palio, Multnomah Bible College/Seminary) or at least driven past (Reed College).  More importantly, he deals with issues I can relate to, like romance struggles, dealing with (or being) a difficult roommate, and feeling a little different than the &quot;normal&quot; Christian.  He even has a website, [...]  It's a bit sparse, but there's a couple chapters of &quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot; that you can check out to see if the book might be to your liking.<br />But the best thing I got out of &quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot; was Imago Dei, the church Mr. Miller calls home.  I've been looking for a church where I didn't feel like an outsider, so after reading about Mr. Miller's adventures at Imago Dei I decided to check it out.  It has quite an eclectic congregation, but I fit in with them more than the typical suburban churches I've previously attended.  Even my non-Christian older brother finds it more appealing.  So, I'm grateful to Mr. Miller for his help in leading me to Imago Dei through &quot;Blue Like Jazz.&quot;  Have I met him?  Not yet.  I'm hoping when I do I don't come across like a fawning fan-boy.  Well, that's a risk I'll have to take.<br />FYI - I found out from one of the author's roommates that he is finishing up his next book, tentatively titled &quot;Looking For God Knows What.&quot;  I'll be on deck for that one when it hits the stands.

The Eurostar was still running, so I booked passage from Paris to London instead of heading to Barcelona as originally intended.  I urgently needed a good London guidebook, so I rushed to a Gard du Nord newsstand and quickly scanned the shelves.  \\"Time Out London\\" was the only choice they had, so I forked over some Euros and hoped it would suffice.<br />As I read while the Eurostar sped towards England, I found \\"Time Out London\\" to be informative and well laid-out.  I struck up a conversation with the couple across from me (he was Irish, she was English), and had a great time talking about their deep involvement in the European art community.  When we neared our final stop, they asked to see my guidebook, and after looking through it remarked it was a good choice.  The used the excellent train map to point out some prime sightseeing stops, the station closest to my Ibis hotel in East Barking, and even where I needed to catch the express train to Gatwick for my departure flight.  It certainly pays to step out and meet people while traveling.<br />Their suggestions increased my respect for this guidebook, and helped me maximize my limited time in London.  The railway map made it easy to get around, and the city map highlighted must-see sights so I had no problems finding Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, and a host of other attractions.  As is my custom when leaving for a new destination, I left the \\"Time Out London\\" guide behind for someone else to enjoy.<br />If you are heading to London, I highly recommend taking this \\"Time Out\\" guide along.  One important detail stood out:  At a London bookstore I compared this book's rail map to a couple of pocket guides, and found that the \\"Time Out\\" map was larger.  In fact, it was the only one long enough to include the East Barking train stop, where my hotel was located.  I'm glad I had that map  - anything that expedites the process of finding one's hotel in a strange city after a long day of travel is a godsend.- anything that expedites the process of finding one's hotel in a strange city after a long day of travel is a godsend.	2004-04-09

Going through it before I hit Paris got me in the traveling mood, and I used it constantly while I was there.  If you only have room for a single Paris guidebook, this is the one.<br />The fold-out Metro map expedited my travels around the City of Lights (once I got the hang of how the trains ran).  Each Top 10 section helped me prioritize my wanderings, locate various sites, and gave good concise historical background.  For example, the Top 10 exhibits in the Louvre are pictured and described, which provided a necessary focus in such a huge, overwhelming museum.  However, the guide's Louvre map was not quite up to speed, although I didn't consider that to be a big issue.<br />The compact format was easy to use, and the color pictures were a great visual aid.  It also fit perfectly in my Eagle Creek shoulder bag or my pantleg cargo pocket, so it wasn't a burden.  When I was getting ready to depart Paris for London at the Gard du Nord, I left the book on a table and watched from the upstairs to see who would take it.  I hoped the guide would serve them as well as it did me.<br />Looking for other information on Paris or France to prep for your trip?  I found Rick Steves' books and the &quot;Let's Go&quot; guides helpful as well, and &quot;60 Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong&quot; by Jean-Benoit Nadeau and Julie Barlow is great for insight into France and the French.  Happy travels!	2004-03-25

Along with prayer, it's a critical way to grow deeper in our relationship with God.  However, it can be difficult to find a translation that lends itself to regular contemplation.  \\"The Message\\" solves that problem.  Written in contemporary language, \\"The Message\\" really makes the Scriptures accessible for everyday meditation.  I have been going through it during my lunchtime at work, and I enjoy its overall tone, vocabulary, and structure.  I've run into some words and phrases that are a bit jarring (you'll know them when you see them), but nothing to cry \\"Ichabod\\" over.<br />There are those who struggle with the idea of a dynamic or paraphrase-style Bible version.  True, they are not word-for-word like a literal translation from the original languages.  But Hebrew and Greek do not easily conform into smoothly flowing English.  So stick with a literal translation for study, but if you want the best readability you'll have to go the dynamic/paraphrase route.  As Mr. Peterson writes in the preface, he intends \\"The Message\\" to be \\"a reading Bible\\", and not a replacement for study Bibles such as the New American Standard Version.  If you own one of each and use it accordingly you'll be good to go.<br />I had a seminary professor who half-joked that NIV stood for \\"Nearly Inspired Version\\" due to some passages he felt were inferior to those in the more scholarly translations.  I suppose a similar moniker could be applied to \\"The Message\\", since it may share that issue as well.  Be that as it may, Mr. Peterson has delivered a paraphrase translation that God can use to make Himself known to you.  Whatever version you ultimately choose, I can't stress enough the importance of spending time in the Word.  \\"The Message\\" will make that an easier habit to develop.	2004-01-24

Like the subtitle states, Mr. Ramsey dispenses &quot;straight-shooting, no-frills financial wisdom&quot; that is mainly geared toward getting out of debt and becoming fiscally responsible (If you already have control of your money and are looking for information about becoming wealthy, then you might be better served reading &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko).<br />After looking over his other books and website, it appears that &quot;Priceless&quot; is merely an introduction to the author's personal finance master strategy.  Indeed, it primarily contains testimonials, autobiographical anecdotes, various proverbial sayings, and Biblical verses related to money.  If you desire more in-depth instruction and by-the-numbers techniques on money management using Mr. Ramsey's methods, you'll have to get his other finance books and/or become a member of his online &quot;Total Money Makeover&quot; club.  &quot;Priceless&quot; is a good, inexpensive way to see if that course of action might appeal to you or not.<br />Even though I just read &quot;Priceless&quot;, I had long ago implemented some of Mr. Ramsey's primary debt reduction strategies: put aside an emergency savings fund, paid off debts using the &quot;snowball&quot; method, and got rid of extraneous credit cards.  I'm happy to say that these methodologies do help slay the debt monster, although to be honest you can find variations on them in countless books of this nature.  However, &quot;Priceless&quot; distinguishes itself with a Biblically-based financial stewardship slant, including a challenge to use money for the glory of God and the good of others via tithing and giving.  That's probably the best single financial principle Mr. Ramsey offers.	2004-01-09

But I wanted to find something about the actual experience with a more autobiographical slant.  I spotted &quot;The Perfect Vehicle&quot; on Amazon.com, and it immediately caught my interest.  The reader reviews were quite interesting, ranging from exuberant identification to scathing dismissal.  Any book that generates feedback of such jarring disparity must have something to say, so I went ahead and took a chance on it.<br />Ms. Pierson has pretty much bared her soul in this book, and my attention never wandered from start to finish.  She's a strong, yet vulnerable woman who embarked on a quest to reconcile her desire to find a man worthy of her love with a need for independence and adventure.  Motorcycling was the medium that allowed her to explore both of these (apparently) conflicting dictates of the heart.  After much relational and highway mileage, Ms. Pierson seems to have made peace with herself, and this book is a well-written chronicle of that journey.<br />&quot;The Perfect Vehicle&quot; does contain some interesting facts about motorcycle history, rallies, and so on.  However, it's Ms. Pierson's relationships and riding experiences combined with the resulting insights that really make this book shine.  Some reviewers have slammed her for being a man-hater, too introspective, or a Moto Guzzi snob, but I disagree (well, the Moto Guzzi bias might have some merit, but I have a similar affection for Harleys, so I won't cast stones).  If I grow half as much as she did via motorcycling, I'll consider the money invested into my H-D Fat Boy well spent.  &quot;The Perfect Vehicle&quot; is a great addition to the motorcyclist's library, and anyone who has a passion for adventure and self-discovery will enjoy it as well.	2003-12-10

It seems that Christian publishers tend to simultaneously release books that deal with similar themes (work of the Holy Spirit, grace, etc.).  The latest trend appears to be on rising above the ordinary and living passionately for Christ. &quot;Don't Waste Your Life&quot; is a stand-out book among this crowd.  John Piper is one of the giants of modern Christian writing, and this book is another showcase of his gifts.<br />Movies and TV series like &quot;Office Space&quot; and &quot;The Office&quot; strike a nerve because we identify with their main theme - the futility of the average life.  How many of us feel that we've somehow managed to settle for complacency and boredom instead of the risk and passion that we dream about?  In the Christian's case, how many are just playing it safe by focusing on the 'thou-shalt-nots' instead of actually stepping out in faith to DO God's will?  These are difficult questions to answer honestly, but we must do so for our own eternal good.  For as Piper states, &quot;only what's done for Christ will last.&quot;<br />Each chapter of &quot;Don't Waste Your Life&quot; deals with different aspects of magnifying Christ.  Risk-taking, suffering, and the workplace are all arenas where we can glorify God and enjoy Him as we lead our daily lives.  However, the last chapter reveals Piper's heart: missions.  Ultimately, the overarching theme of this book is winning others to Christ by our lives, and if necessary, by our words.  To that end, Piper implores the reader &quot;in the name of Jesus to wake up, and enlarge your heart, and stretch your mind, and spread your wings.&quot;  For when all is said and done, what really matters is that those who are lost are lost no more.	2003-11-11

Until recently, I've never had the desire to ride a motorcycle, mainly because I was afraid of becoming an organ donor. However, that suddenly changed a couple of months back, probably due to turning 37 and sitting through a marathon viewing session of &quot;American Chopper&quot; episodes.  So, I began to shop around for a bike that would fit me, and at the same time I tapped into all the informational sources I could find about motorcycling (friends, the Web, etc.).  &quot;Proficient Motorcycling&quot; was one of the first books I read, and I bought it based on the good reviews I saw on Amazon.com.<br />It was my desire to arm myself with as much knowledge and hands-on riding skills as possible before swinging a leg over the motorcycle I finally settled upon (a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy).  I signed up at a local Harley-Davidson dealer for a &quot;Rider's Edge&quot; class, and &quot;Proficient Motorcycling&quot; was an excellent supplement to the MSF course materials.  Indeed, Mr. Hough recommends taking an MSF course, and frankly I can't imagine a novice trying to ride without formal instruction.<br />The techniques that Mr. Hough advocates in &quot;Proficient Motorcycling&quot; have made me a better AND safer rider.  I feel more confident riding my new H-D, and therefore I'm able to enjoy my road-time that much more.  I've already started reading the book's sequel &quot;More Proficient Motorcycling: Mastering the Ride&quot; to build upon what I've learned so far.

Even though I never bought into the whole &quot;freedom fries&quot; thing, until recently I would've been less than kind in my appraisal of the French.  However, after visiting Paris for four days in June of '03, I came away with a whole new appreciation for France and its people.  I backpacked through four different countries during my trip, and France ended up being my hands-down favorite.<br />Why the change of heart?  Well, first of all Paris has to be seen to be believed.  I'm a history buff, and the city is soaked with centuries of it.  However, it was the people that really made an impression on me.  I was assisted in my wanderings by a number of kind French, including a woman who gave myself and some others an impromptu tour of Notre Dame, and even had three of us over for (free) dinner at her parent's restaurant.  And all that just because I asked her for directions!  I confess that I fell in love with Paris, and after returning home I began looking for books to learn more about a place that could turn my opinions around so quickly.<br />I almost skipped over this one - the title and goofy cover art made me think it was some sort of satire.  But I gave it a shot, and it turned out to be one of the best books I've read this year.  It answered many questions I had about France and the French, from the turbulent history that formed the French national identity, to why a Frenchman spent about a minute correcting my pronounciation of &quot;Champs Elysees.&quot;  Better yet, the authors write in an accessible, entertaining style, even when dissecting the minutia of French government. A great read from start to finish - don't let this one get away.<br />I can't wait to go back to Paris, and if you feel as I do, or just want to know why &quot;60 Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong&quot;, then by all means get this book!	2003-07-17

Dr. Zacharias deals with these seemingly contradictory sensations in a fictional conversation between Jesus (with an assist by Blaise Pascal) and Oscar Wilde, a man known for his Bacchian way of approaching life.<br />For me, &quot;Sense and Sensuality&quot; served as a reminder of the transitory nature of human existence, and thus the futility of finding hope in pleasure or living in fear of pain.  After all, to have a shot at the best pleasures possible you have to be young, healthy, good-looking, and rich (or so sayeth the Media).  But how many people actually have all of those qualities in abundance, and how long do they really last?  Even Hugh Hefner will pass away someday, and then what?  Suffering in this world is the other side of the coin, and as bad as it is, death will deliver us from it someday.  Therefore, if this life is all there is, then we might as well throw our lot in with Wilde and live it up.  Even the Bible agrees with that mindset (1 Cor. 15:32).<br />But, what if there is more to existence than this life?  Do suffering and happiness serve a greater purpose?  As Dr. Zacharias' Jesus states, &quot;pain and pleasure are pointers to what ultimately matters (pg. 80)&quot; - and that is a loving relationship with God through the gospel of Christ.  It is in this context that an eternal perspective based on a passion for God is cultivated, a &quot;fire...in the soul&quot; as Pascal states.  Only then can pleasure and pain be put into perspective, and understood for what they are.<br />It appears that other reviewers are a bit upset at Dr. Zacharias' portrayal of Oscar Wilde, but perhaps they can take comfort in the idea that Wilde may be exposed to a wider audience as a result.  At any rate, &quot;Sense and Sensuality&quot; is a quick read that will generate long-term contemplation.	2003-07-17

I'm a sucker for any book along those lines, whether it's about a spontaneous summer road-trip across the States, or the tale of an epic backpacking journey around the world. There's a special place in my heart for the somewhat rare Christian-themed story of this nature, and that's where this excellent book comes in.<br />Adventures like this tend to be lived out by the younger crowd - those in their late teens or early twenties, anxious to see what's \\"out there\\" in the world and learn something about themselves in the process. In \\"Prayer and the Art of Volkswagon Maintenance,\\" the two protagonists fit this description to a tee. Donald and Paul are young twentysomething Christian men, and they have a desire to know God in a deeper sense. Their solution - a road trip! Starting from Texas, they decide to head off to Oregon in Paul's beat-up VW van. Along the way, they discuss the usual questions that young men wrestle with - relationships with women, their future, and so on. They also meet a number of interesting characters on the road, usually when struggling with their somewhat unreliable vehicle.<br />However, since this book has a Christian slant, there is spiritual depth as well. Both of these guys really do want to go deeper with God, and they end up digging into some serious meat along those lines. Donald, driven by intellect and facts, repeatedly explores the book of Ecclesiastes during the trip in an attempt to make sense of the time we are given upon this world. Paul is more in tune with his feelings and emotions, and goes to a deeper level with God via prayer during some tense moments. Together they make the perfect team for this type of excursion, and both come to know more about themselves and their God. All of this is expertly chronicled by Donald's outstanding writing - he made me feel that I was right along with them every step of the way.<br />The neatest thing about this book for me was their detour through my hometown, and the awesome consequence of that seemingly insignificant decision (SPOILER HINT: it has to do with marriage). How cool is that?!

But &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot; caused me to re-evaluate the actual motives behind my Christian service, and even my walk with God as a whole.  It is Dr. Crabb's contention that we as Christians tend to treat our faith as a means to get what we desire - happiness, blessings, and &quot;the good life.&quot;  We want Heaven now, and therefore do whatever we can to achieve that goal.  His words cut deeply, and made me realize how often I value my own personal well-being and comfort over taking risks as part of my relationship with Jesus.  I fear suffering, and the loss that accompanies it.  However, Dr. Crabb counters that such disasters (i.e. shattered dreams) can lead to a genuine fulfillment found only in a love relationship with the living God.<br />Dr. Crabb uses the Biblical book of Ruth to illustrate his thesis.  Naomi's early life is an example of shattered dreams that were ultimately redeemed later on for a greater purpose by a loving God.  His points are well-reasoned, and I came away with a whole new appreciation for this small, yet powerful Old Testament story.  Indeed, a book that throws down the spiritual gauntlet like &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot; needs a Scriptural foundation, and Dr. Crabb comes through admirably in this regard.<br />I should point out that Dr. Crabb is not trying to steer the Christian towards an aesthetic existence devoid of desire.  Nor is he advocating a fatalistic view of life in general.  Instead, he encourages us to be deeply thankful for God's blessings, and enjoy them as such.  But &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot; cautions us against believing that Christians are entitled to achieve blessing and avoid suffering via some sort of &quot;right action&quot; formula.  This self-centered way of life doesn't reflect the heart of God, and ultimately misses out on the joy He offers to those who truly walk in the Spirit.<br />If there is any weakness in &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot;, it's one that I've seen in past works by Dr. Crabb.  He is very long and detailed in diagnosis, but a bit sparse when it comes to remedy.  To his credit, Dr. Crabb has founded New Way Ministries (discussed at the book's conclusion) in order to lead Christians toward a transformed life in Christ.  I look forward to seeing what will come of it (as an aside, you may wish to read Dr. Crabb's &quot;The Pressure's Off&quot; and &quot;Revolution Within&quot; by Dwight Edwards for additional material along the lines of &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot;).<br />I've been broadsided by Dr. Crabb's books before, but never so much as with &quot;Shattered Dreams.&quot; This book has challenged me to evaluate my true motivations for following and serving God, and it is a wake-up call for all those who claim that Jesus Christ is their Lord and first love.in the Spirit.<br />If there is any weakness in &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot;, it's one that I've seen in past works by Dr. Crabb.

I look forward to seeing what will come of it (as an aside, you may wish to read Dr. Crabb's &quot;The Pressure's Off&quot; and &quot;Revolution Within&quot; by Dwight Edwards for additional material along the lines of &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot;).<br />I've been broadsided by Dr. Crabb's books before, but never so much as with &quot;Shattered Dreams.&quot; This book has challenged me to evaluate my true motivations for following and serving God, and it is a wake-up call for all those who claim that Jesus Christ is their Lord and first love.	2003-04-10

US	49158850	R6M6XUVYFSO82	0966396669	751201630	I Married You	Books	4	15	15	N	N	An honest, insightful book about marriage.	I had to read \\"I Married You\\" for a seminary Premarital/Marital counseling course, and I found it to be quite fascinating.  I was particularly intrigued by the setting - an unnamed country in Africa.  That set it apart from most marriage books right from the start, since along with the usual relational insights, \\"I Married You\\" acted as a window into another culture's relationships with God and each other.  Of course there were differences, such as the intriguing way the African church service was conducted compared to a typical white American one.  However, the universal relational issues Trobisch portrays really enabled me to identify with persons I am united with by faith, if not by race or culture.<br />Regardless of where in the world one calls \\"home\\", Trobisch makes a solid case for the sanctity and strength of marriage as an institution.  The book's theme is based on the classic Biblical marriage passage Genesis 2:24, boiled down to \\"leave, cleave, and become one flesh.\\"  Leaving occurs when the man and woman enter into a legal relationship and create a family unit that is independent from their parents.  Then, they cleave together as one in an exclusive relationship, and finally become one flesh in body, soul, and spirit, sharing everything.  It is this foundation that forms marriage as God intended it.  Trobisch goes on to Biblically debunk the idea that the marriage union is meant to subvert women and empower men to dominate them.  He also shows how pitfalls like premarital sex can damage the marriage relationship before it even begins.  Helpfully, he makes his points by using intuitively recognizable allegories and illustrations that, while very relevant to African culture, are easily understood by the average Westerner.  For example, a marriage philosophy that denigrates women and children is referred to as the \\"garden\\" concept (very agricultural in nature), while the ideal union is symbolized by the image of a three-legged stool (a visual aid suggested to Trobisch by an elderly African woman in order to liven up his plainer \\"triangle\\" illustration).  As for the day-to-day aspects of marriage, Trobisch suggests ways that a couple can discover more about themselves and their relationship.  An example is the \\"quarrel\\" test, where the spouses honestly question whether or not they can really forgive each other and resolve conflict.  Unstable marriage relationships are discussed as well, such as the \\"empty\\" marriage, characterized by lack of love and an increase in alienation.<br />The book's main strength lies with Trobisch's skill in identifying the above principles within the context of real-life relationships, including his own marriage.  \\"I Married You\\" is not just another dry, sugarcoated \\"how-to\\" marriage manual.  Instead, we can identify with everyone Trobisch encounters, from the somewhat immature single man in his 30s with an idealized portrait of a wife that no real woman could match, to Trobisch's own long-suffering wife Ingrid.  Indeed, one of the most affecting parts of the book is seeing Trobisch absolutely blow it with her, right after multiple days of teaching and counseling others concerning the ideals listed above!  It is this kind of transparent honesty that really set \\"I Married You\\" above other books in the genre.  My only gripe would be the inadequate treatment Trobisch gives to the single life as a valid alternative to marriage.  However, such a rabbit trail would have veered too far from the book's central theme, so he can be forgiven for that small transgression.  Overall, I can enthusiastically recommend this book as required reading for anyone interested in this topic, particularly engaged couples.d to Trobisch by an elderly African woman in order to liven up his plainer \\"triangle\\" illustration).

One of my seminary counseling teachers wanted to make Pure Desire required reading during the Fall 2001 semester, but had read it too late to include it in our class reading list. Her strong recommendation of this book made me want to read it ASAP, and I managed to fit it in between my regular course reading. It was definitely worth the free time I had to sacrifice in order to read it. Suffice to say, Pure Desire is one of the best books on healing sexual addiction that I've ever read. I can say that because I've been able to personally investigate the book's background and apply its truths to my own life, since I live very close to Ted Roberts' church in Gresham, Oregon.<br />In addition to reading the book, I attended Dr. Roberts' three-day Pure Desire Seminar, which is intended for pastors who want to start a ministry for sexual addicts in their own churches. During the seminar, I (and others) directly questioned Dr. Roberts and his staff about their methods, theology, etc. Their answers backed up what I read in the book, and my interaction with them showed me their genuine desire to see people healed from the bondage of sexual addiction. Finally, I visited one of their For Men Only (FMO) sexual addiction healing groups as part of my seminary internship, and I found it so helpful for my own struggles that I have stayed with it for almost nine months and counting.<br />Basically, I have found the methods and ideas presented in the book to actually work in real life. For example, one of the main healing strategies Dr. Roberts advocates is to become part of a small group where men can \\"confess [their] trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that [they] may be healed (James 4:7).\\" I have seen a number of men go through the FMO group I attend, and there seem to be two types. First, there are the ones who know they have a problem (usually because they have gotten into trouble due to their addiction), but are not really ready to deal with it. These men tend to stay for awhile, and then leave the group to go back to their addiction. Second, there are the ones who have truly hit bottom and are willing to persevere on the long road to healing. It is these men who are honest with their struggles, and therefore they avoid such traps as rationalizing and compartmentalizing their addiction. Sure, we all take turns with discouragement and despair, and lapses do occur. But when others are there to lovingly bear the burden and provide accountability, it helps us get through the valley and go back up the mountainside. Of all the small groups I've been in over the years, this one has by far been the best for my own personal healing. Therefore, I can vouch firsthand for Dr. Roberts' exhortation to avoid the trap of isolation (which makes it easy to act out) by becoming part of a healthy group situation.<br />I believe that the central theme of Pure Desire is the restoration of healthy, loving, and holy relationships with God, self, and others. Sexual addiction is a symptom of a deeper relational problem. It is a sinful solution to a real desire for intimacy on the part of the addict. Pure Desire presents a way out of this trap that really works if you want to follow it. No, its not easy or quick, because true healing in this area takes time. And to be honest, it can be difficult to find help for this issue due to the closed-minded attitude of some churches toward sexual issues and problems. But it is possible, because I have found Christians willing to help, and over time I have observed healing gradually taking place in myself and others. If you are struggling with sexual addiction, you need to read this book (and others like it) and get help. You can pay now by owing up to your problem and getting on the road to healing, or you can pay later with your marriage, your reputation, or even your life.

US	49158850	R2J9UUFWWGI1SE	0684815001	763680226	The Cost of Discipleship	Books	5	648	668	N	N	An excellent book on what it means to follow Christ	I recently took a seminary class that dealt with traditions in Christian devotion, and one of the assignments was to pick a classic Christian book and do a report on it.  I chose &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; because I had wanted to read it for some time.  Much has been said about the book's power, and I desired to experience that for myself.  After finishing it, I can see why &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; has challenged so many in their walk with Christ.<br />The book's major theme centers on what it really means to be a disciple of Christ. This is summed up by Bonhoeffer's statement that Christ calls us to &quot;come and die.&quot;  Christ wants all of us - nothing is to be held back.  One is either a disciple of Christ, or they are not.  There is no middle ground.  The true disciple is dying to his or her life as a whole, and their old life is being replaced with the life of Christ.<br />&quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; is soaked in Scripture, and that is one of its main strengths.  This is not surprising, since reading the Bible actually contributed to Bonhoeffer's personal conversion and commitment to Christ.  Bonhoeffer constantly refers to Biblical passages to make his points, and he does not resort to storytelling or even personal anecdotes.  One can sense his deep love for the Bible and for Christ throughout the book.  Another strength is Bonhoeffer's conveyance of how imperative commitment to Christ really is.  Bonhoeffer was an early foe of Adolph Hitler, and this book was published while he was being persecuted by the Nazis.  Thererfore, he wrote as one who has stood for Christ in tough times, and he knew that Christ is one's only hope.  Indeed, he eventually gave his life for his faith, and by all Christian and secular accounts glorified God to the very end.  Finally, even though &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; was published in 1937, every page in this book counters the &quot;easy believism&quot; and license that tempt and seduce many Christians today.  Bonhoeffer attacks &quot;cheap grace&quot; and demands a steadfast, deep loyalty to Christ.  He illustrates the power and holiness of God in a way that indicates the necessity of a healthy, reverent fear towards God.<br />However, I did have a couple of minor issues with the book.  It is somewhat densely written, and therefore may be daunting to the average layreader.  Bonhoeffer was a highly educated theologian, and it shows in his writing style.  In addition, Bonhoeffer tends to neglect grace in favor of emphasizing absolute holiness and commitment.  His moralistic leanings have the danger of encouraging legalism and asceticism if a reader is inclined toward those pitfalls.  I'm sure this was not his intent, since it was Bonhoeffer's genuine love for Christ that motivated his passion and perseverance.  But this may be a situation where a person takes for granted a truth they have worked through and internalized, and therefore they fail to communicate it to others because it is so integral to them.  I think Bonhoeffer loved God so deeply, with all his being, that he never thought to specifically describe loving God as the basis for the principles in this book.  However, it is also possible that the times he lived in prevented a more introspective writing style.  Bonhoeffer was under persecution by a political regime that he knew to be the epitome of evil.  Therefore, he knew what was at stake, and so focused on what needed to be heard about the cost of Christian discipleship, with the assumption (or at least hope) that the reader already had an abiding love for Christ.<br />Overall, &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; challenged me in a number of ways.  First, Bonhoeffer's life and death were inspiring - he lived what he wrote, and I consider him to be an example of faith in action that every Christian should emulate.  I pray that I would face persecution with his courage and perseverance.  Second, his linking of sanctification with being part of the Body of Christ encourages me to avoid being a &quot;lone wolf&quot; Christian.  It's important for my spiritual health to become part of a church so that I can minister to others and be ministered to as well.  Third, his love for Scripture reminds me to never forsake reading the Bible, and also not to rely exclusively on the writings of others, or their interpretations of Scripture.  Fourth, his focus on a relationship with Christ prods me to examine my own relationship with Him, and to ensure that I don't neglect it.  Finally, his statement that Christ bids us to &quot;come and die&quot; leads me to evaluate the level of my own commitment as a Christian, especially in light of current events.<br />&quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; was difficult to read.  This was in part due to its literary density, but also because of its powerful message about the true cost of being a disciple of Christ.

A couple of friends had recommended it to me, including one in a small group I attended who said it helped him with relational issues.  Therefore, I was glad to see &quot;Search For Significance&quot; on the reading list for one of my seminary courses.  When I finished it, I was not disappointed.  I found it to be very well done and a solid aid to my walk with God in the area of proper self-concept.<br />As with &quot;Victory Over The Darkness&quot;, I was really encouraged by the heavy Scriptural emphasis in &quot;Search For Significance.&quot;  This was especially important, given the author's theme concerning how our self-concept should be based on God's view of us.  Such an assertion required the proper usage of key Biblical passages, and McGee took care to do just that.  Indeed, the author actually stated his awareness that the Word of God is our final authority on our identity in Christ, regardless of the negative messages from the world, Satan, and even from within us.<br />The book's overall organization was also an important feature of &quot;Search For Significance.&quot;  McGee created a solid, simple outline that formed the foundation for the book.  First, he lists the \\"Four False Beliefs\\" - Performance, Approval, Blame, and Shame - that cover the major negative self-concept pitfalls which people tend to embrace.  He then goes on to identify \\"God's Answer\\" to each false belief - Justification, Reconciliation, Propitiation, and Regeneration - and provides the Scriptural basis for these answers.  The outline is especially helpful because it provides a concise, at-a-glance reminder of the book's overall theme that makes it easier to comprehend and apply his teachings.  From there, McGee goes on to devote two full chapters to each False Belief and its corresponding Answer.<br />After dealing with the Four False Beliefs and God's Answer to each of them, McGee devotes the last three chapters toward setting up a continuous plan to renew the heart and mind so that one can reinforce the lessons already learned.  In chapter eleven he reminds us of our new identity in Christ, and that the Holy Spirit is the true agent of change in the Christian's life.  He continues by identifying five pitfalls that \\"stem from a misunderstanding of Christ's love and forgiveness, and often prevent us from experiencing His presence and power.\\" Of course, McGee provides a Biblical rebuttal for each of them.  In the next chapter McGee illustrates the difference between guilt and conviction in a manner I found to be very well done.  In fact, it is an excellent apologetic counter to the assertion that Christianity is motivated by guilt.  In the final chapter, McGee makes it clear that renewing the mind is \\"more than repeating some words over and over.\\"  He once more stresses the fundamental role of the Holy Spirit.  But he also states that our God-given emotions can be used to detect deception and assist in change.  Once again, McGee provides a helpful outline that enables one to understand and apply the overall truth he conveys.  He defines this phase of replacing false beliefs and replacing them with God's truth as \\"The Trip In.\\"  The three-stage Trip In begins at Bondage, where we are trapped in false beliefs.  Obedience is the next stage, where we identify false beliefs and choose to \\"stand firm on what God has revealed to us.\\"  Finally, we experience Freedom when false beliefs are replaced with God's truth.<br />The &quot;Search For Significance&quot; was definitely worth reading.  I found McGee's simple, well-organized format to be especially helpful in assimilating its Biblically based message about how my self-concept should be based on God's view of me.  A continual, prayerful application of McGee's methods will provide fertile ground for the Holy Spirit to guide one on their own \\"Trip In\\" towards a walk based not on false beliefs, but on God's truth.th.	2001-11-17

I have been intrigued by the concept of being a new creation in Christ ever since I read &quot;Alive for the First Time&quot; by David Needham a couple of years ago.  After seeing a video Mr. Anderson did about forgiveness in one of my seminary classes, I wanted to learn more about his ideas, since they seemed to echo Needham's.  So it was with anticipation that I began reading this book.<br />Anderson's theme in &quot;Victory Over The Darkness&quot; is the Christian's status as a new creation in Jesus Christ.  As Christians, we are alive in Him, and are no longer dead in our sins.  We are spiritual beings - indwelt by the Holy Spirit and reliant upon his power.  If this were not the case, then we would be unable to experience change on a fundamental, spiritual level.  The title &quot;Victory Over The Darkness&quot; perfectly fits the book's central idea of our true standing as Christians - we are indeed victorious in Christ.  However, a lot of Christians still live in unnecessary defeat, and play the same negative thought tapes over and over again.  Anderson's desire is that we forsake these false internal messages for the vital truths found in Scripture.<br />An important aspect of &quot;Victory Over the Darkness&quot; is its heavy Scriptural basis.  This is extremely important, because if there is nothing beyond us in which we can put our hope, then there is really no point in striving for radical internal change.  If we are the highest beings in the universe, the only real imperative to change is conformation to societal mores and avoidance of legal penalties.  The secular world's constant redefinition of right and wrong is not based on a foundational truth.  What's wrong today can be right tomorrow, and vice versa.  In such a society, the only necessary change is based on altering external behavior to achieve conformity.  However, the existence of an unchanging, holy God characterized by love, grace, and holiness invalidates such a scenario.  There is Something beyond us, a greater reality that is based on true perfection.  God is concerned with internal change in us based on His righteousness. These changes serve to produce external actions which glorify Him.  Therefore, it is absolutely imperative that we have a deep knowledge of Scripture, for it is our main method of knowing and relating to God and man in a loving manner.  This point cannot be stressed enough.<br />I found a number of Anderson's practical recommendations to be eminently useful.  First, his admonition for us to forgive is key, and he backs it up with solid Scriptural quotations.  Too often we are in bondage to the hurts of the past, and we miss out on God's forgiveness and freedom if we fail to forgive (Matt. 6:14-15).  There are some people that I continually need to forgive, and I know that I run to God for forgiveness quite often.  Unforgiveness on my part hinders my relationship with God, and that's a scary proposition.  Better to forgive (or seek forgiveness) and be free to live a redeemed life, rather than remain in fatal bondage to pride and bitterness.  Second, Anderson's insights into rejection are also important, especially since many people fear it and live their lives accordingly.  I have had my share of rejection, and it's very hurtful.  But fear of rejection inevitably produces the sin of self-protection, and that's ultimately even worse than any rejection can ever be.  That's because we miss out on the kind of true love that can only be had by taking relational risks.  The principle of &quot;high risk, high return&quot; applies.  These actions are easier said than done, of course, and they are often part of a long, difficult healing process.  But they are necessary applications on our part, and their importance cannot be denied.<br />I have to say that the lessons in this book are not a quick solution to any problem.  They are based on having a love relationship with Christ, and not on a list of do's and don'ts that guarantee emotional health overnight.  God usually takes time working change in our lives, and ultimately He is in control of any internal change.  But I know that He does want us to have the fruits of the Spirit (see Galatians), so there is hope for our hurts - even if they remain in order to make us rely on His grace.  I recommend that this book be read in conjunction with &quot;Inside Out&quot;, &quot;From Bondage to Bonding&quot;, and &quot;The Search for Significance.&quot;  The Scriptural truths in these four books are liberating and healing.love relationship with Christ, and not on a list of do's and don'ts that guarantee emotional health overnight.

US	49158850	R1VQ84GFDRXCQ5	0891096205	611622489	From Bondage to Bonding: Escaping Codependency, Embracing Biblical Love (God's Design for the Family)	Books	4	49	51	N	N	Good book on identifying and dealing with codependency	At first, I had been a bit skeptical about &quot;From Bondage To Bonding.&quot;  A cursory glance through it revealed what I thought to be too much psychobabble and not enough Scriptural foundation, so I set it aside and forgot about it.  Recently, however, I had to read it for a seminary counseling class.  After completing the book, I realized that even though I had some issues with it, I was somewhat harsh in my initial judgment.  Although I found it to be a bit denser and more &quot;psychiatric&quot; than other Christian books in the genre, &quot;Bondage to Bonding&quot; contained a necessary message.  The main theme was relational transformation based on recovery from codependency.  The author defines codependency as &quot;a self-focused way of life in which a person, blind to his or her true self, continually reacts to others, being controlled by and seeking to control their behavior, attitudes, and/or opinions, resulting in spiritual sterility, loss of authenticity, and absence of intimacy (pg. 162).&quot;  Codependency is the bondage that holds us back from genuine, loving relationship with God and others.  One of the book's major benefits is it's identification of numerous codependent behaviors, such as denial, controlling others, and self-sufficiency.  The author provides a number of examples of codependent behavior from her own life and the lives of others she has counseled.  I found the author's honesty about her own issues to be refreshing, and her victories to be encouraging.  The study questions at the end of each chapter were especially helpful in determining my own codependent issues and how they originated.<br />An interesting facet of &quot;Bondage to Bonding&quot; was its incorporation of the Twelve-Step methodology for dealing with addiction.  The author left it in its basic form, but modified it somewhat by adding specifically Christian references.  She also created a relational framework that sums up the journey into codependence, and from there to healthy relationships.  The negative side of the framework illustrates the downward path one takes toward bondage, or autonomy.  Autonomy is the low point - one is living a self-sufficient life where an attempt is made to generate self-acceptance, forgiveness, and empowerment apart from God, resulting in spiritual rebellion, a distorted view of self, and problems with intimacy.  The positive side of the framework demonstrates the upward path of recovery toward a state of bonding, or mutual interdependence.  This ideal stage is where one can give and receive love and forgiveness without demanding approval or conformity to expectations in return, resulting in spiritual vitality, a balanced view of self, and genuine intimacy.  The entire framework represents the stages that are traveled in order to reach either bondage or bonding (hence the book's title).  The author is careful to note that the positive path is not a &quot;once-for-all&quot; journey but actually a &quot;repetitive and cyclical&quot; pattern that must be traveled constantly.  This is an important point that cannot be stressed enough in our immediate-gratification based society.<br />&quot;From Bondage to Bonding&quot; has some parallels with the book &quot;Inside Out&quot; by Larry Crabb, most notably when &quot;Bondage to Bonding&quot; identifies the sin of self-protection and the need to love God, self, and others more.  The relational framework in &quot;Bondage to Bonding&quot; also bears some resemblance to Crabb's ideas that pain and deep emotions must be allowed to surface and be experienced, and that one must genuinely repent and turn from relational sins.  In addition, the aspect of seeking and giving forgiveness when appropriate is also stressed in order to right relational wrongs and find freedom from bitterness.  These are the points that I found to be the most beneficial.  However, &quot;Bondage to Bonding&quot; tends to focus more on behavioral change that is generated by the individual and less on spiritual change wrought by God.  The author does include a relationship with God as an important necessity, but I would have liked more of a focus on the power of God to work foundational changes in one's life.<br />The main issue I had with &quot;Bondage to Bonding&quot; is its focus on the &quot;victim&quot; mentality, undoubtedly influenced by the incorporation of the Twelve-Step program.  I believe that this perspective can be a double-edged sword.  Yes, we are a hurting race, and I can say from my own life that there is much pain to deal with and changes to be made.  Also, the demonstrated results of Twelve-Step programs cannot be denied, especially in the lives of people devastated by addiction and victimization.  But I believe that as a Christian, I am a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and therefore I am no longer identified as a victim regardless of what has been done to me.  My ultimate hope is in Christ and His promises as revealed in Scripture.  Therefore, I am not dealing from a position of my own weakness, but instead I can rely on God's strength.  It is He who ultimately changes hearts, and I am glad that &quot;Bondage to Bonding&quot; includes a love relationship with God as a necessity.

US	49158850	RTH76QEHKU7L5	1576830829	851183883	Inside Out	Books	5	47	49	N	N	This book is changing my life for the better.	I began reading &quot;Inside Out&quot; with a wait-and-see attitude, since I had heard it criticized as being &quot;too psychological.&quot;  I personally see psychiatry as valuable as long as it has a Biblical foundation, so I wanted to give Dr. Crabb the benefit of the doubt.  I didn't really expect too much out of the book, especially since I had to read it for a class.  But after a couple of chapters, my presuppositions were destroyed.  When Dr. Crabb defined self-protection as a major sin holding many people in bondage, I knew that I was one of its chief practitioners.<br />As I read on, I could see how the hurts of my past had led me to practice self-protection, especially toward the opposite sex.  I saw how insular I'd become, and that I had gradually ceased from taking relational risks with women.  I rationalized my behavior by convincing myself that I was setting &quot;boundaries&quot; when in reality I was creating barriers.  I have dedicated much of the last couple of years to knowing and loving God more, but I had failed to practice the other command that goes along with that:  Love others as yourself.<br />I believe that God prepared my heart beforehand so that this book would have maximum impact.  It cut through my barriers and exposed how the sin of self-protection has prevented me from reaching out and forming relationships.  Since men are wired to be initiators, this was a terrible bondage to be in.  I still had relational needs that were being denied, and at times I &quot;medicated&quot; them wrongly.  But since I finished this book, I have sought to initiate more and take healthy relational risks.  There's no quick fixes here, but there is the possibility of growth and progression in the right direction.<br />It's my desire that I not forget what I have read in &quot;Inside Out,&quot; and actually apply its lessons to my life.  I do not want to be bound by pain and living in a self-imposed prison.  Yes, I realize that there is still the possibility of being hurt and spitefully used, and Crabb is realistic about that happening.  I also know that my deepest needs will not be realized until I am face-to-face with God in Heaven.  But while I'm here, I need to take the risk to love others regardless of how they may respond.  Loving God and others more, and expressing that devotion in a healthy way is the best lesson one can learn from &quot;Inside Out.&quot;y of being hurt and spitefully used, and Crabb is realistic about that happening.

Lately I've noticed an increase in the publication of Christian-based books about sexual addiction. They have been written because there seems to be a growing number of men in the church who are trapped and defeated by sexual issues. This problem is one that needs to be addressed at a basic level, and this book does that in an admirably honest and straightforward fashion. It is well-written, and should be read by anyone involved in this issue. But there is a crucial aspect which should be taken into account when reading this book (and others like it) that I'll expand upon below.<br />Each individual book within this genre tends to have a similar overall message and methodology - &quot;sin bad, purity good, here's how to stay holy, etc.&quot; There's usually a unique slant to them as well, depending on whatever point the author feels the need to make. In the case of &quot;The Silent War,&quot; the focus is on the negative consequences of sex addiction and involvement with pornography. Much of the book documents the casualties on all fronts of the &quot;Silent War&quot; - the men who risk everything to fulfill their sex addiction, the family members they devastate, and the women who put their physical, emotional, and spiritual health on the line by their personal involvement in the porn industry. This is particularly effective because it shows the human cost of sexual addiction, and destroys the myth that pornography is a &quot;victimless&quot; crime. It's only in the last couple of chapters that a solution for those in bondage to this sin is offered, and it is along the usual Christian lines of accountability, prayer, fleeing temptation, Scripture meditation/memorization, and so forth.<br />I liked the book - it's an easy read, the main author is very transparent about his own struggles with pornography, and the message is an important one. However, any Christian who is dealing with sexual addiction and pornography should not rely on this book alone (although it can be said that any single book on this topic is somehow inadequate). While sound, the solutions listed above will only &quot;work&quot; for the reader if they have a growing love relationship with Christ, and a PRIMARY desire to know Him and obey Him. If one simply concentrates on eliminating the sin (the negative) without discovering an acceptable alternative (the positive), then I think eventually they will fall again. Personal holiness is a byproduct of our relationship with God - it's not an end in itself. If that is kept in mind, then &quot;The Silent War&quot; is worth reading as an aid to strengthening one's existing walk with God.be said that any single book on this topic is somehow inadequate).

There's something about the idea of &quot;finding oneself&quot; on the open road that really gets me going.  I'm a sucker for any book along those lines, whether it's about a spontaneous summer road-trip across the States, or the tale of an epic backpacking journey around the world.  There's a special place in my heart for the somewhat rare Christian-themed story of this nature, and that's where this excellent book comes in.<br />Adventures like this tend to be lived out by the younger crowd - those in their late teens or early twenties, anxious to see what's &quot;out there&quot; in the world and learn something about themselves in the process.  In &quot;Prayer and the Art of Volkswagon Maintenance,&quot; the two protagonists fit this description to a tee.  Donald and Paul are young twentysomething Christian men, and they have a desire to know God in a deeper sense.  Their solution - a road trip!  Starting from Texas, they decide to head off to Oregon in Paul's beat-up VW van.  Along the way, they discuss the usual questions that young men wrestle with - relationships with women, their future, and so on.  They also meet a number of interesting characters on the road, usually when struggling with their somewhat unreliable vehicle.<br />However, since this book has a Christian slant, there is spiritual depth as well.  Both of these guys really do want to go deeper with God, and they end up digging into some serious meat along those lines.  Donald, driven by intellect and facts, repeatedly explores the book of Ecclesiastes during the trip in an attempt to make sense of the time we are given upon this world.  Paul is more in tune with his feelings and emotions, and goes to a deeper level with God via prayer during some tense moments.  Together they make the perfect team for this type of excursion, and both come to know more about themselves and their God.  All of this is expertly chronicled by Donald's outstanding writing - he made me feel that I was right along with them every step of the way.<br />The neatest thing about this book for me was their detour through my hometown, and the awesome consequence of that seemingly insignificant decision (SPOILER HINT: it has to do with marriage).  How cool is that?!

I've been a fan of Michael's music for a number of years, so when he began to write books, I was eager to see what he had to say. And I haven't been disappointed yet. He has a very readable and personal writing style, and he's not afraid to be transparent. As for content, it's always relevant and based on tested Scriptural principles. It's awesome to see how strong his faith has remained during his high-profile years in the music business, where temptations are many and humility is easy to lose. A major contribution to his stability lies in the solid friendships he has maintained with other strong Christians. Friendship is important to him, and he wants others to reap its many benefits as well. That's a major reason why he wrote this book.<br />&quot;I Will Be Your Friend&quot; attracted me because of relational issues I have recently encountered in my own life. As I've entered my thirties, my desire to improve my current friendships has increased, since they have sustained me through a number of tough times. I want the ability to properly edify, encourage, and even rebuke my friends for the benefit of their character, and our relationship. In addition, I'd like to gain skills on forming solid new friendships, which is sometimes difficult for an introvert like myself.<br />So, when I came across this book I knew it was one I needed to read. And I'm glad I did. Michael illustrates a number of truths he's learned over the years about friendship. He touches on such topics as setting boundaries, accountability, the importance of being vulnerable, mentoring, and servanthood. Michael shares a lot from his own personal experiences, and it's refreshing to see that he even records his own relational missteps. Even better, his insights are tied to Scripture, and he is clear that God is the source of whatever wisdom he has.<br />I particularly recommend this book to men, since we seem less capable than women (or at least less willing) when it comes to forming deep friendships. It's important that we cultivate this ability, since the benefits are many and the alternatives are definitely less than God's best.ps.

This small but powerful book shows that cost, and how one man remained faithful to his wife despite it.<br />Robertson, a distinguished man high in Christian academic circles, is shocked when his vivacious wife Muriel is diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  Gradually, she begins to succumb to its ravages and is forced to abandon her popular radio show and speaking engagements.  As the disease takes its toll on Muriel, Robertson devotes more and more time to watching over her.  He leaves his work and other pursuits to care for her because without his presence, she becomes fearful and agitated.  Only with him near is she happy and content.  Eventually she becomes totally dependent upon him, unable to perform rudimentary tasks or even converse.<br />But the heart of the story is that he remains with her gratefully, and with a loving attitude.  He is not an angry or resentful caretaker.  Of course, he is not thrilled to watch his lovely, intelligent wife slide into helpless dementia.  But he sees his caretaking as a holy task, one entrusted to him by God.  Indeed, she &quot;took care&quot; of him for decades, so he finds it a priviledge to return the favor.  However, he is careful to state that his is not the &quot;ideal&quot; way to care for a severely ailing loved one.  But I would say that his attitude and actions are examples for anyone, regardless of whatever caretaking path is chosen.<br />Elisabeth Elliot once wrote that marriage is the abandonment of self.  Robertson lovingly exemplifies that principle in the midst of a heart-breaking situation - all for the glory of God.  Highly recommended.	2001-08-08

As a single Christian man in a sexually charged society, I am always on the lookout for books that help me on the path to sexual purity.  This book certainly falls into that category.  The authors face this crucial issue head-on, and they provide good insights on how to deal with it.<br />One complaint I had (which echoes that of another reviewer) was the overly negative response to this issue by the wives and female friends of the authors.  While such a reaction to the actual sin is appropriate, they seemed very negative and judgmental towards the temptation itself.  One woman even said she wasn't sure if she could marry again if her husband died due to her distain for this common male struggle!  I think an encouraging and challenging attitute from a woman would go a lot farther toward helping a man through this fight than one of condemnation. After all, women have their own struggles as well, if the huge markets for romance novels and diet plans are any indication. ;-) As the saying goes, &quot;united we stand, divided we fall.&quot;<br />I have seen one pitfall with these kind of books.  The danger of focusing too much on fighting a particular sin or struggle to the detriment of what should be our real focus - a positive, love relationship with Christ.  Indeed, Jesus said that the fulfillment of the law is to &quot;love God with all your heart, strength, soul, and mind,&quot; and the second is like it, to &quot;love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;  That, coupled with the comparison of the church as &quot;the bride of Christ&quot; leads me to believe that the best remedy for this (or any) issue is to cultivate a constant love relationship with God.  Of course, that doesn't negate one's personal responsibility for holiness, nor does it alleviate the need for accountability.  But if we fail to meet our need for love and intimacy in the right way, we will continue to try and meet it the wrong way - with sin.<br />Other books on this topic I would recommend are &quot;The War Within&quot; by Robert Daniels and &quot;Freedom from Sinful Thoughts&quot; by J.

I really enjoyed being able to actually talk to an author of a book that I liked and respected, and not being disappointed by the experience.), and &quot;Freedom from Sinful Thoughts&quot; by J. Heinrich Arnold. The Bible is quite helpful as well...;-)  God Bless, and finish strong!Good Men are Tempted&quot; by Bill Perkins (a nice guy - he spoke at one of my Multnomah Seminary grad chapels once, and was very personable yet challenging.
