It belongs on the shelf of every Bacon fan and artist, regardless of medium. Nine interviews range from 1962 to 1986, Bacon's fifties through his seventies, in the form of interactive conversations with art historian David Sylvester (British, 1924-2001), ranging from Bacon's frustrated youth to his unique artistic techniques, the meaning of art to the meaning of life. Sylvester cleverly steers toward topics Bacon finds interesting, allowing him to discuss them at length. (Some of the original audio may be sampled at BBC4's website, though this book's text was heavily edited and re-manipulated from those recordings.)<br />The final chapter is the most biographical. Bacon, 77, recaps his life and career in detail, including his &quot;coming out,&quot; at a time homosexuality was illegal in Britain, the relationship with his intolerant father coming to an end as a result. Overall, the book forms a clear portrait of an intellectually restless artist, demonized by the struggle to express satisfactorily the horrific images which constantly stream into his head. There is no overarching structure to the book, thus many interviews cover the same ground different ways, with illuminating results. Bacon's answers usually reinforce or embellish what was said earlier, but he sometimes answers the same question differently over time, demonstrated for example by his increasing dislike for &quot;drink and drugs.&quot;<br />Some themes persist throughout. Chronically anxious and hypertensive, he can never sit still, never relax. Not religious, Bacon believes &quot;man is an accident, a futile being, he must play out the game without reason,&quot; and life has only whatever meaning we give it, yet his haunted soul clearly identifies with the tragedy of the Crucifixion, which he considers the perfect narrative of the mythic &quot;tragic hero,&quot; and the ultimate symbol of human devotion despite life's vicissitudes. (One famous Bacon work metaphorically depicts a hypodermic syringe stuck into the subject's arm, representing a nail stuck into the hand). He is similarly affected by the open-mouthed cry of human agony, which he expresses in perhaps his most famous and retold obsession, the many horrifying studies of Velazquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X.<br />Too human, he is concerned with posterity, and denies himself the comfort of calling himself a &quot;painter.&quot; He believes an artist must &quot;solve the problem&quot; of art to be a success, which to him means they must render the known through the unknown, or create the &quot;illustrative&quot; and &quot;narrative&quot; through the use of the &quot;irrational.&quot; Discussing Picasso in this light, he says he finds surrealism &quot;more real&quot; than realism, probably meaning he finds surrealism more directly communicates the human condition. He also believes strongly in figuration, slaying abstract art with one devastating word: &quot;Fashion!&quot; He seems burdened by a lack of proper training, having started his career as an interior designer, especially when discussing the trials of his studio work, describing the way he tosses paint at the canvas, the way he tries not to work a canvas too much, potentially ruining it, and the conflicted feelings he holds toward works he has already painted, or those he is still painting.<br />The book usefully reproduces many works in small black-and-white images at times when the conversation turns to them, both Bacon's works and those of others, like Picasso and Rembrandt. The lack of color is entirely unnoticed, as the book focuses on the artist's psychology and opinion, which these plates illustrate perfectly. (Full-color reproduction would probably also have made the book needlessly expensive). Most remarkably, of all the photographs and self-portraits in the book, Bacon never looks directly at the viewer, illustrating most strikingly his natural over-sensitivity and tortured self-denial.<br />Bacon has said &quot;art is completely a game by which man distracts himself,&quot; and &quot;the artist must really deepen the game in order to be worth anything at all.&quot; If anyone feels Bacon &quot;played the game&quot; well, and &quot;distracts&quot; successfully his audience, or that he was &quot;worth anything at all,&quot; then this book belongs in that person's library.iewer, illustrating most strikingly his natural over-sensitivity and tortured self-denial.<br />Bacon has said &quot;art is completely a game by which man distracts himself,&quot; and &quot;the artist must really deepen the game in order to be worth anything at all.&quot; If anyone feels Bacon &quot;played the game&quot; well, and &quot;distracts&quot; successfully his audience, or that he was &quot;worth anything at all,&quot; then this book belongs in that person's library.	2003-09-29

A human secret agent, in disguise, infiltrates the Sirian Empire, a fascist police state at war with earth. Like a tiny harmless insect flying around a full-sized motorcar, distracting the driver and causing a fatal accident, James Mowry tries to cause domestic chaos among the Sirians, hoping to distract the Sirians, faciliating a Terran attack. The story is witty and well-paced, Mowry almost anticipating television's MacGyver, except turned free-wheeling terrorist: resourceful, daring, intelligent, and above all effective.<br />Eric Frank Russell became a popular writer of science fiction after spending World War II in the RAF (he was from England, 1905-1978). His light-hearted stories aren't outright comedies, but typically celebrate the advantages of modern technology, and the victory of individuality over bureaucratic pompousity. His storytelling in \\"Wasp\\" is brisk, his writing sharp. This novel is intelligent, compelling, easy to read, and brief (175 pages), almost a cross between between science fiction and fine literature. SF fans will enjoy the action and the clever use of technology (surprisingly not too out-dated), and literary readers will enjoy the author's insightful dissection of fascist society, through his secret agent's resourceful and almost joyous use of that society's foolish rigidity against it. Mowry hops dexterously from episode to episode, leaving increased anarchy and chaos in his twisty trail. It's the satisfying and suspensful adventure of a charming provocateur.	2003-09-26

It is written by Thomas Bernhard, about Paul Wittgenstein, who were good friends for over a decade. It ranks unquestionably among Berhnard's finest works. (The book was written in 1982. Bernhard was Austrian, 1931-1989, and met Wittgentstein (1924-1979) in 1967).<br />The book holds to no fixed plot, but is a series of discursive episodes about the author and his friend engaged in various episodes: meeting in a hospital, attending the opera, visiting a once-cosmopolitan friend now living in the remote rural lands of Austria, frequenting the same literary clubs and cafes, and many similar tales.<br />Every vignette is a jewel, and they are plenty, but few are about Paul directly, or reveal Thomas's feelings explicitly. Each time Bernhard begins talking directly about Paul, or his inner feelings, he diverts attention quickly to another story. His heart is so obviously broken he cannot bear to talk about his friend, but only their good times together. Still, it is abundantly clear from his story-telling, Thomas loves Paul like a brother, truly a \\"best friend.\\"<br />Paul was a brilliant man, like his famous uncle Ludwig, the philosopher, and musically talented, like another Paul Wittgenstein (Ludwig's brother, the pianist) but also emotionally unstable, and financially irresponsible. After a late-life divorce, in his usual ill health, Bernhard describes Paul crying, in his dark and empty apartment, in rough condition despite its prime city location, but tells us he left Paul alone in his misery, to go sit in the park. Thomas cannot face his emotions at all. He cannot express himself this way, and to this day it eats him up inside. As an author, and a man of erudition and education, he does his best to express himself in the only way he understands, which is through intellectual discourse.<br />During their friendship, Paul asked Thomas to speak at his funeral of an optimistically projected \\"two hundred friends.\\" \\"Wittgenstein's Nephew\\" is essentially that eulogy, delivered with loving tenderness, and heartaching apology. It is not melodramatic, it is always in intellectual control, but it communicates its tragedy effectively clearly nonetheless. It begins unremarkably, and seems to wander thereafter without much direction, but by the end it has proven itself compelling and interesting. We are delighted to read the personal tale of two best friends, yet also sympathetic toward Thomas's need to unburden his soul. It is undoubtedly one of Bernhard's superior works, like \\"Yes\\" before it (1978), and \\"Extinction\\" afterward (1986).ak at his funeral of an optimistically projected \\"two hundred friends.\\" \\"Wittgenstein's Nephew\\" is essentially that eulogy, delivered with loving tenderness, and heartaching apology.

It questions whether one life is more valuable than another, or whether one person can truly know another, in our disconnected modern world of the Information Age.<br />Jose Saramago writes in a lovely poetic style (b 1922, Portugal). His phrases wash over the mind like waves caressing a sandy beach. His prose is elegant and confident, his sentences sinuous, and his paragraphs lengthy. It will take a few pages for an unaccustomed reader to become familiar with his style, but enjoyment sets in soon enough, and the effort pays off as you nestle comfortably into Saramago's literary approach.<br />Senhor Jose is a menial clerk at the \\"Central Registry of Births, Marriages, and Deaths.\\" All important events are recorded here country-wide, upon a small card for each citizen, stored in a cavernous facility of shelves, ladders, and boxes, with Orwellian proficiency. Jose is so connected to the Registry, he lives in a small attached apartment, with a communicating door to the main building. He is a dreamer, clipping magazines in his spare time for stories about his hundred most famous countrymen. One day he decides to copy these celebrities' data cards, to enhance his collection. He sneaks into the Registry at night with a flashlight, withdrawing to his apartment to copy them, then replaces them afterward. The project terrifies him, not for fear of committing a crime, but of conducting an activity without the direct permission of his supervisors.<br />One night Jose retrieves five \\"famous\\" cards, but notices a sixth stuck in his pile: that of an unknown 36-year-old woman. Who is she? Isn't her card just like all the famous ones? Isn't it unfair to think differently of her than of them? Jose becomes obsessed, and decides to investigate her life. He locates her parents, her neighbors, even her primary school, breaking into it ineptly, in order to discover even more records in the paper trail of her life. What does he learn? Do a person's legal records match their human reality? And what will happen to his job?<br />The conclusion of the story is powerful and lovely, devastating but satisfying. Saramago explores skillfully the mystery of life in our modern world, and the meaning of one person to another, relative to the traces of information we leave behind. The writing is masterful and the resolution emotional, but the book is never melodramatic or artificial. The reader can expect a deeply meaningful and affecting work, which is highly recommendable. Having read four of Saramago's more popular works as well, I can say I find \\"All The Names\\" arguably the finest gem of his body of work.l of her life. What does he learn?

The book is written in Thomas Bernhard's curmudgeonly signature style, a rambling chaotic monologue, one episode following the other in darting succession, building the story one parcel at a time, culminating in a climax less of action than philosophical insight (1931-1989, Austria).<br />The narrator (clearly a proxy for Bernhard) sits aloof and alone, in a comfortable chair at a cocktail party, held in honor of a famous actor performing on a local stage. The actor arrives after a lengthy delay, and the group sits down to a midnight dinner, where the actor engages the group in charming, if stilted, conversation. Through it all, the effusive narrator volunteers how much he hates being there, how much he hates his hosts (while complaining how much he once loved them), how much he hates Austrian bourgeois society, and so on, until the party ends, the actor leaves, and the narrator sums up his thoughts. Hardly naive, he realizes most people don't much like him either, but also apologetic, he doesn't much care.<br />The work is a meditation on artificiality, playing on the contrast between the artifice of city life and the authenticity of the rural, and questioning whether the actor is still play-acting, even in this &quot;casual&quot; setting. Like other Bernhard works, it is written without a single paragraph break in all of its 181 pages. While interesting and capable, this work's conclusion and final insight is not as powerful or effective as those of works such as &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;Extinction,&quot; or &quot;Wittgenstein's Nephew.&quot; Also, it might have made more sense to English-language readers if the title were &quot;Lumberjacks,&quot; to suggest its central conflict more clearly.more clearly.	2003-09-11

Uh oh. The countercultural cred is being blown already. At one point mid-novel, in an excellent little scene, it boldly compares the Holocaust to the Rwandan massacres. Gee, what kind of disrespectful guy is this Moses character anyway? Actually, the whole book is a gutsy cultural statement for a mainstream mystery novel, especially for one with this character's past, and this author's history. The book is written with a sense of personal freedom and confidence, which clearly shows through.<br />And oh yeah ... during all this cultural commentary, there's apparently a mystery novel going on. (Smile.) Seriously, I loved the feeling of being on a movie set. It's such a mysterious industry to begin with, it was so interesting to read about it from an insider's point of view, seeing it treated like any other real job. Moses even shows his hand at directing at one point, which was a lot of fun to read.<br />I also loved the wonderful descriptions of Prague, which made me jealous of the author's experiences there; as well as all the contemporary references to the Internet sprinkled throughout the book, which were really fun to see in a novel. It certainly had its share of the \\"mystery novel\\" kind of surprises too, with enough twists and turns to keep the plot going from Los Angeles, to Prague, to New Mexico, to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah.<br />The only question is, if the novel begins with a bang, does it end with a bang? I'll never tell. But I will say this book can be recommended as the nation's first post-9/11 mystery novel.	2003-08-20

It begins as two high school friends, Bernard Profitendieu and Olivier Molinier, prepare for the bacchalaureat, their final exam.  Bernard finds some letters hidden at home which show he is illegitimate, and runs away from home, thus setting in motion a rich set of adventures among a cast of mind-boggling proportions.  From Bernard, Olivier and their parents, the story quickly grows to include Olivier's younger brother George, his uncle Edouard, Edouard's friend Laura, Olivier's older brother Vincent, Vincent's friend Robert Count Passavant, Passavant's lover Lady Griffith, Edouard's old schoolmate Victor Strouvilhou, Victor's nephew Gheri, Laura's father Vedel, Edouard's old piano teacher Perouse, and Perouse's grandson Boris, among many others.  As this prodigious cast assembles itself, the fireworks really begin!<br />The reader will be amazed by all the ways these characters interconnect with each other.  For example, at the beginning of the book, Edouard is traveling from London to Paris to visit and advise Laura, who is trying to extricate herself from an extra-marital affair, but only upon arriving will he learn Laura's paramour is actually his nephew Vincent.  Many similar connections between most of the characters will be revealed during the course of this motivating story.  \\"The Counterfeiters\\" is less a plotted novel than a finely-woven tapestry.  Every character interacts with almost every other.  The chapters are brief, only a dozen pages or so, but most focus on one of these interactions in particular, making for a compelling narrative.  It was notably experimental for its time, but extremely readable, and still fresh today.<br />The title describes a counterfeiting ring which uses children, like something from Dickens's \\"Oliver Twist\\", to pass off gold-plated glass disks for coins.  Gide's broader theme, however, is that of falsehood in general, like that popular theme of 19th-century French literature, namely hypocrisy.  Beside the counterfeiting ring itself, Gide describes fathers with illegitimate children, adults with hidden affairs, and people generally searching for truth among the artifice of life.<br />Gide's characters are brilliantly conceived, executed on a par with his predecessor Balzac, whom Gide himself called \\"possibly our greatest novelist\\" (as published in the invaluable reference in the appendix of this book, the illuminating journal Gide himself kept while writing \\"The Counterfeiters\\").  There is something of Balzac's Goriot in Gide's Perouse, something of Rastignac in Bernard, and perhaps even a little Vautrin in Passavant.  But Gide's literary style is markedly different.  Where Balzac told self-contained stories, usually ones with social morals attached (as did most 19th-century French authors), Gide tells us he is \\"fond of sudden endings,\\" and \\"it is an insult to explain what the attentive reader has understood\\" (both also paraphrased from this book's appendix).<br />Gide weaves dozens of strands of the story, intersecting every character with every other character, drawing lines to question the moral behavior of each interaction, an experimental gambit for its time.  But I'm pleased to say Gide's experiment worked.  The complete book is a brilliant success.  His \\"novelist's novel\\" is perhaps one of the most important literary results of the early twentieth century, crafting a compelling story of interesting characters, maintaining great intellectual interest throughout.  This novel is recommendable to anyone who enjoys fine literature.<br />Note: Other reviews invariably paint this book in shocking shades of homosexual or hedonistic material, but this is misleading at best. It's true, a homosexual and hedonistic tone appears at places, Count Passavant being the worst offender, but Gide is not a pornographer, he is a moralist.  Homosexual himself, Gide was also Protestant (Huguenot), and like his brilliant work \\"The Immoralist\\", he believes in showing a moral lesson through human action.<br />Finally, two small quibbles: An emotional incident at the end of the book, based on a newspaper article Gide clipped, seems incongruous with the rest.  It doesn't detract from the book, but it seems tacked on for special effect.  Also, while excellent for the most part, the translation insists on leaving some expressions in the French original, such as \\"chef d'oeuvre\\" instead of \\"masterpiece\\", or \\"entr'acte\\" instead of \\"intermission\\".t (Huguenot), and like his brilliant work \\"The Immoralist\\", he believes in showing a moral lesson through human action.<br />Finally, two small quibbles: An emotional incident at the end of the book, based on a newspaper article Gide clipped, seems incongruous with the rest.

He fears sacrilege, not to mention abject failure, but ultimately agrees. Loew is a man of Hebrew letters, the symbolic glyphs of his faith. Will his knowledge of those sacred symbols help him uncover the metaphysical key to life, bestowing it upon lifeless clay?<br />From Loew's colorful Prague, we jump back to our own time, to the story of Victor Werker's birth in Amsterdam a few years after World War Two, and the various tales and complications of the pregnancy and birth. Victor becomes a geneticist, and studies the letters of genetic sequencing, A, C, G, and T, the idiomatic symbols of his own profession. Will his education of those four letters unlock the scientific mystery of life, granting it to lifeless matter?<br />Victor invents an organism he calls the eobiont, \\"Life's Dawn\\". He becomes famous, and suffers the jealousy of Barend Brock, a colleague spurned by Victor after he tries to take credit for Victor's discovery. Victor diarizes his relationship to Clara, including Clara's pregnancy and their break-up, through letters to their daughter Aurora.<br />This novel is foremost of ideas.  Today's metaphysical novelist's challenge seems to update the tale of Frankenstein (or Prometheus) to the age of genetics. Rabbi Loew's story is fascinating, and Victor Werker's struggles are interesting, but the book would benefit by describing more clearly the motivations of Loew and the Emperor, or delving more deeply into Victor's goals in life and career. Such details might help flesh the text out a bit more fully. Mulisch is a fine writer, and his novel \\"The Assault\\" (1982) is undoubtedly one of the more brilliant pieces of contemporary fiction from Europe today, but \\"The Procedure\\" does not weave tight the threads it has spun.<br />Nonetheless, \\"The Procedure\\" is a well-paced novel (230pp), and contains a number of interesting ideas, regarding the nature of life, love, and history.

He tells us he is just thirty years old and looking for adventure, a progressive and aesthetic intellectual in a conservative city. He disdains the many requests he receives for abortions, invariably turning them away, not of his own beliefs, but because he fears Sweden's hypocritical society would ostracize him.<br />One day a young lady named Helga provides his life a twist, coming to his examination room, pleading for him to declare she has an \\"infection of the womb\\", so her husband of six years, Pastor Gregorius, will not touch her sexually. In truth, she has another man in mind. Glas knows Gregorius personally, and despises him for his own reasons, but after some moral agonizing, the young doctor takes the bull by the horns, \\"diagnosing\\" Gregorius with a \\"weak heart\\", telling him sex could kill him. This medically-enforced chastity drives Gregorius mad, and he \\"rapes\\" his wife out of frustration one night. To diffuse the elevating tension, Gregorius takes a brief trip to another town, during which his wife openly appears in public with her lover back home on Stockholm's streets. Glas, the first-person narrator of this book, reflects on the meaning of life, recalling the young girls he knew earlier in life, admitting he has never held a female in an embrace, and finding himself falling in love with Helga himself.<br />In his diary, Glas wonders if abortion and murder are not similar, in the sense that both relieve a burden of life. Glas wonders if Gregorius could justifiably be killed to relieve the \\"burden\\" upon his wife Helga. He reflects on morality, love, sex, and religion, his thoughts become increasingly feverish. He debates the issue through his diary, turning through various twists of logic, trying to find a relative position which is simultaneously moral and expedient. He even goes so far as to prepare two tablets of potassium cyanide, one for the pastor, and one for himself, should his plan go badly. He clearly loses mental clarity with his obsession over this issue.<br />Will he actually try to kill Gregorius? Will he woo Helga for himself? Will he drop the entire issue, and snap back to reality? Will he accomplish the impossible reconciliation between morality and his impulses? The resolution will be an interesting one, but Glas will offer only one insight: \\"Life, I do not understand you.\\"<br />The book itself is nicely written, the prose lovely of description, polite, high-toned, and at times romantic, and the subject matter frank, from schoolboy wonderment and embarrassment, to \\"husband's rights\\" and the moral place of abortion, euthanasia, murder, love, sex, infidelity, and unrequited love in society. The narration is elegant, and this brief novel (150pp) is actually surprisingly substantial.

He settles easily into his new school, even managing to experience some grown-up pleasures with a local prostitute.  He enjoys his new freedom and intellectual stimulation, finding his new environment preferable to the staid life of home, and his new friends more sophisticated than his country parents. He meets two intellectually confident boys, Beineberg, a spiritualist philosopher, and Reiting, a logicalist mathematician, both budding into youthful ideologues, both naively experimental and both youthfully extreme.  Torless is drawn to their dominant personalities, and the three form a small club, meeting secretly in an attic storage room, which the rest of the school has long forgotten.<br />Another boy, Basini, weak-willed and rather spineless, is caught robbing. The boys have heard his mother called \\"Excellency\\" during a visit, but for some reason Basini cannot support himself financially. To find money, he borrows it from his friends, but when he cannot repay one, he borrows from another, in an endless deception. Reiting and Beineberg catch Basini at his game, and decide to blackmail him into servitude, exhibiting the casual cruelty boys so naturally inflict upon each other. Each boy tortures Basini according to his own ideology, the philosophical Beineberg trying to manipulate his soul, the mathematical Reiting trying to demonstrate universal theories of humanity. The torture is not just psychological, but also physical, and even sexual.  The entire business confuses Torless at first, and shocks him further the more he sees, ultimately forcing him to take sides. Will he join the game as well, or defend Basini himself, or leave all three to their fate? Will Torless adopt the heartless exploratory endeavors of his two intellectual and stimulating friends, or will he rediscover the old-fashioned morals of his common-place parents?  And where are the adults during this brutish tableau?  Will Torless surrender his friends to the school's authorities, possibly fanning the flames some more? No matter what path Torless might choose, it is clear the outcome will be dramatic.<br />The writing itself is first-class. An educated psychologist, and an academic contemporary of Sigmund Freud, Robert Musil demonstrates great skill describing his characters and settings. The boys are drawn in perfect psychological illustrations of reality, the plot episodes effective and well-conceived, and the entire book superbly executed. Contemporary readers will recognize the same struggle in Torless that William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" would explore a half-century later (1954): How do undisciplined youth behave in the absense of guardians?<br />In \\"Lord of the Flies\\", after descending into deadly primitivism, the youth can only be rescued by outside forces. In \\"Torless\\", however, the choice rests upon the shoulders of Torless himself, making this drama far more compelling than Golding's.  If not for a few brief sexual episodes, the book might be much more widespread among high schools than \\"Lord of the Flies\\". Nothing in \\"Torless\\" reaches even a portion of the gratuitous frankness of popular culture today, so I only hope more schools will open their eyes to this superior tale soon.  The realistic school-house drama of \\"Torless\\" speaks more effectively to the modern reader than Golding's abstract fantasy island. This book can easily be recommended to anyone interested in the themes at the heart of this concise (160pp) and well-written novel: the moral struggles of adolescence, the tension of values between a \\"simple country upbringing\\" and the \\"sophisticated upper-class\\", and the ideologically destructive potential of both ill-conceived philosophy and pseudo-science.lectual and stimulating friends, or will he rediscover the old-fashioned morals of his common-place parents?

Mr Hitchens provides an invaluable historical reference of magazine-style contemporary news essays. He deserves the highest praise for compiling his perceptive thoughts into a literate and coherent selection of meaningful essays.<br />Note, to left-leaning Americans: This book does not argue that Clinton \\"destroyed the country\\" from some sort of socially-conservative (i.e., Republican) point of view at all. These are not essays from the pages of The Wall Street Journal by any means. On the contrary, Hitchens testifies that Clinton destroyed American LIBERALISM, from the point of view of a committed socialist, which Hitchens most solidly is. At one point, Hitchens asks why, given the effect he had on both parties, Republicans hate Clinton at all. It is for this reason that this book is an unusual and highly recommendable perspective for anyone who has the slightest interest in the subject, as well as those who have the greatest revulsion.<br />Hitchens examines Clinton's record of war, his accusations of sexual abuse, his relationship with Dick Morris, his skill at \\"triangulation\\", and his relationship with his wife, Hillary. These are not new topics, they have been discussed at great length and in excruciating detail for the last ten years, but Hitchens handles them all with such skill and wit that his compendium deserves reading by even the most jaded partisan or news-weary person.<br />In a surprisingly brief volume, but one dense with information, Hitchens portrays in precise detail a man beholden to corporate interests, upper-class elitism, and big money influence-peddling. He accuses Clinton of adherence to an agenda which dismantled welfare, cut government regulation, increased the lot of America's wealthy, and did everything an American liberal is purportedly against. Hitchens even uses the Clintons' own words against them in making his case. Most interestingly, be believes Clinton won votes from Republicans because he gave them legislation they wanted, and from Democrats because he gave them the empty symbolism of the White House.<br />If you are a right-leaning American, you will either delight, or take horror, in the myriad sordid tales, page after page, of a man corrupt to the bone. On the other hand, if you are a left-leaning American, you truly owe it to yourself to read these essays, and ask yourself how the Democrat Party endorsed this man, and how they came to such abuse by him. I have the feeling that if more Democrats read this book, they would be more angry than the thousands of Republicans who already have.<br />Mr Hitchens has created an unimpeachable journalistic reference, objectively fair, and incisively harsh. Despite partisan arguments of the many who have read it (as well as many who have not!), nothing in his book can be denied, nothing can be disproven, and nothing can be dismissed. There is a true story on every page, confirmed by a glance in any modern source of news information. Even if someone were to accuse Mr Hitchens of subjectivity in some of his stories, or an impure agenda by collecting them all in one place, the simple fact is, there are so many stories inhabiting these pages, it is so thick with them, and Clinton's life is so comprised of them, the matter is out of Hitchens's hands. It comes with the territory. Clinton did, after all, commit the acts Hitchens describes. In any event, the net effect of Hitchens's brief is profound indeed.<br />As far as the writing itself, Hitchens is highly literate, clearly well-educated, and charmingly erudite, even when pejorating or cursing. He displays an impressive command of the English language, in both vocabulary and idiom, though never unreadably so. This book is a delight to read from cover to cover. Anyone interested in American politics, whether liberal, conservative, or moderate, will find it informative. Most readers will find it equally hilarious and horrific, but all will find it thought-provoking and entertaining.nservative, or moderate, will find it informative.

This book is a group of a half-dozen related essays, each exploring a specific aspect of Levi's view of the Holocaust's causes and effects.<br />He begins with the concept of \\"good faith\\", wondering whether believing a lie excuses it. He notes that oppressors lie to save themselves from believing they are evil, and victims lie to save themselves from believing they suffer. He explores the moral zone between black and white, noting that anybody can be a tough killer or a foolish victim: we are all tyrants and victims in our own way.<br />He examines survivor's guilt, and reflects on the roles of luck versus blessing in life, and discusses the ways humans need communication to survive, including the way victims bend language to disguise their intentions, and tyrants twist it to cause confusion among their victims.<br />He tries to distinguish between rationalized evil and collective madness. He believes the spirit and mind can be injured just as the body can, and wonders how a person's perspective plays a role in their survival and psychological health. He describes the various stereotypes people hold when they imagine the stories of those who lived through WWII, e.g., the romantic hero, the evil Nazi, the prisoner who always plots escape, and so on, but explains why they are rough and inaccurate.<br />Each chapter is like a conversation with an intelligent and qualified author. It is thoughtful, and a pleasure to read. It reflects on psychological and historical themes which are important not only to our understanding of the Holocaust, but also more generally human nature. (It appears to be a rumination on subjects discussed in his other books, collected and summarized briefly here.) It is for this reason that the book is successful. It considers the Holocaust in particular, but its themes are actually deeper and more universal.<br />\\"Letters from Germans\\", the penultimate chapter, is the book's most powerful, noticeably demonstrating the tension between his memory of that time period, and the memory of various Germans, in their own words. He especially berates those who believe they are doing the right thing by speaking out in shame and guilt over theit past, perhaps attacking them a bit harshly, but certainly with justification. The last chapter, \\"Conclusion\\", is its weakest. In the opinion of this reviewer, it over-generalizes, and tries to apply retrospective analysis to the world's future. It also calls for unwarranted conclusions, unrelated to the preceding chapters, and perhaps contradicts itself. Luckily it is brief, and does not detract from the excellence of the prior explorations.<br />(For example, he says war is unecessary, and mankind can settle all conflicts around a table, but only as long as we are in good faith. He then calls Hitler a buffoon, implying he cannot be taken in good faith. He next says we need not have good faith to negotiate if we are all equally in fear of war, but this sounds like he is saying war is necessary after all, even if only to remind us there are punishments for negotiation in bad faith!)<br />Despite its conclusion (which many readers will probably enjoy, despite this reviewer's belief it over-reaches), the book is an intelligent and even-handed, but personal assessment of the Holocaust, written in an engaging and intelligent style, with brevity and wit. At 200 pages, it is easy to read. Packed with philosophy and insight, it is worth the investment.emes are actually deeper and more universal.<br />\\"Letters from Germans\\", the penultimate chapter, is the book's most powerful, noticeably demonstrating the tension between his memory of that time period, and the memory of various Germans, in their own words.

The book is written in real time, its 300 pages comprising a single narrative, unbroken by chapters, from the party's beginning to its end. Gerry is the narrator, proceeding from event to event, unable to control anything, and hardly able to understand anything, including himself.<br />The book is experimental, but does have a plot, concerning a murder-mystery at Gerry's party of strange guests. The story is told in the tradition of surrealists, however, and not a straightforward narrative. Once the reader settles into understanding how the story works, it becomes a joyful romp through mad times.<br />The theme of the book is very simple: life is a major mess, and it just keeps going. People eat and drink, sleep and sex, live and die, digest and waste, kill and protect, mate monogamously and share polyamorally, control themselves and let themselves go, have children and have fun, grow up and act childish, dirty and clean, dress and undress, lie and speak true, think scientifically and think artistically, fantasize and live pragmatically, search for philosophical meaning and live hedonistically for today. And they never stop! Robert Coover pushes all the buttons in the psyche of the human animal, as if writing a reference manual for an extraterrestrial, telling it: \\"Here's humanity. Welcome to it!\\"<br />This book is experimental and surreal, but arguably more accessible than Beckett, and certainly more earthy and explicit. (This is so Coover can push all your buttons.) It uses an interesting form of dialog occasionally: two or three different conversations interweave their lines, making it a joyful challenge to follow along, and creating interesting intersections at times. There are two dozen characters, all with their own independent dynamic, and Coover mixes them with entertaining effect. Some are consistent, such as the wife, the son, the mother-in-law, and others, who exercise their own unique idiosyncracies steadily throughout the book, like pschological points of reference interweaving with the other characters.<br />This book is very well done. I cannot praise it highly enough. Coover deserves immense credit for pulling it all off. Once the reader understands the story is meant to be absurd, not literal, it becomes great fun, very vivid, and memorable.

Coetzee's novel \\"Disgrace\\" is the story of David Lurie, a professor of classical literature in Cape Town, South Africa. David has been married twice, but divorced both times. He visits prostitutes, and sleeps with female students less than half his age. He is caught by the university, preying on another young lady this semester, but he is unwilling to beg for his job. Stubborn and self-centered, he feels it superficial to make a statement of guilt and apology just to save his skin.<br />He resigns his position, believing he will write a biography or opera about Lord Byron, one of his literary heroes. He takes the opportunity to visit his daughter, Lucy, a young lady with a small farm in a remote region of South Africa, wild and lawless. The two become embroiled in a troublesome event at the farm, and need to reassess their lives as a result.<br />As a male, David basically tries to have sex with everything female. As a female, Lucy seeks protection from males. David cannot believe Lucy accepts this role, not least because she is a strong-willed individual, as well as a lesbian with no male attachments. Reflecting on these thoughts, he blames himself, as a man, for thinking there is no more to life than sex.<br />Near the farm, David meets Bev, a local woman, and friend to his daughter, who treats local animals, sometimes euthanizing them. David cannot bear the thought of killing animals, even unwanted dogs, unhealthy goats, or fatted sheep, and begins to wonder if there more to life than death. He throws himself into the task, helping Bev with her work, perhaps trying to explore death as closely as possible.<br />He wanders away from the farm, tries to return to the university, and his ethereal literary way of life, and basically travels in circles between his two worlds. He works on an opera of Lord Byron's lover, and takes an unhealthy dog as a companion.<br />At the end, David will receive a symbol suggesting the reconciliation of music, poetry, sex, and death, and the book will end on that note. Coetzee does not tell us what David believes at that point, but will ask the reader to reflect on everything they have read, and accept this symbol as a recap of the facts. The reader may reflect on these facts, and believe what they wish.<br />This book's major theme is the struggle between mind and body, spirit and earth. It depicts David's painful separation from the sheltered collegiate utopia of literature and civility, where sex is a harmless past-time (at least in David's idealistic mind), and death is a poetic abstraction, into a state of earthiness, where life is dangerous, death is real, and sex is a fact of life, sometimes a distasteful reality, even a weapon. David will struggle to understand whether both universes can be reconciled, or whether one must trump the other. Is there nothing more to life than sex and death? Is poetry unimportant in the real world?<br />The writing is engaging, and accessible to anyone. It is written with intelligence, but never intimidates. The book can be enjoyed by anyone interested in a story of a father and daughter, and the struggle between life and literature. (The only flaw is minor: a reader unfamiliar with the racial and social characteristics of South Africa might misunderstand which character is which at first, though such things become clear as the book goes on.) This book is highly recommendable to any contemporary reader.<br />The writing is sharp, alive, insightful, efficient, accurate, measured, lyrical, and even poetic at times. The characters are witty and expertly drawn. Their dialog is flawless and unforced, and their personalities convincing. The situations are similarly convincing, never feeling contrived.<br />Near the beginning of the book, Coetzee quotes the final words of Oedipus, the Greek drama: \\"Call no man happy until he is dead.\\" Is it true?

He is in love with Herakles, a young man who seems to return Geryon's affection, but is actually quite cruel in his fickleness. The two encounter each other on and off over the years, Geryon seeking love, Herakles seeking adventure. Their paths eventually cross in Buenos Aires, of all places, where Herakles is with another young man, Ancash, recording the sounds of various volcanos. The three venture through South America together, the tension between the three of them almost palpable, at least to the more sensitive two of the group, Ancash and Geryon. It is here that the three must decide on the nature of their friendship, and Geryon on the nature of his life.<br />This book is written in poetic free verse, and Ann Carson's style is nothing less than magical. It might seem difficult for readers accustomed to straightforward prose, but if one lets the words wash over them, their meaning will all be clear soon enough, and their beauty alone will convince the reader of their merit. The story is based on Greek myth, but rather than Herakles killing Geryon the monster literally, he &quot;kills&quot; by breaking his heart. Ultimately, the book's message seems to be that Geryon must learn to love himself first. The book is beautifully written, and cannot be recommended highly enough, to any reader who wants to read a delicate story in a challenging format.	2002-12-21

Michel spends his life seeking a major discovery about genetics, while Bruno spends his life seeking a major discovery about life. We learn both brothers were all but abandoned by their selfish 1960s hippie mother, and both are struggling with their lives due to the trauma of their early memories of her. They are both atomized particles, adrift in the universe.<br />Bruno spends time at nudist settings and a 1960s-style cult colony, trying to learn as much about the experiences of life as possible, but spending more time with himself than with others. Michel throws himself into his work, trying to learn about the nature of life as possible. The two brothers are essentially players in a drama attempting to explore the classic \\"nature versus nurture\\" arguments of classical and contemporary philosophy and science, i.e., do our genes make us what we are, or does our upbringing?<br />Both brothers fall in love with women and attempt to stabilize their lives, but encounter tragedy within their relationships, some of it caused by the random chance of life, some of it caused by their inability to interact well with others, perhaps due to their chaotic childhoods. Far from escaping their past, their lives increase in entropy. Houellebeq uses the 1960s as an example of bad social structures, and uses genetics as a way of seeking basic notions of life, and whether sex/genetics has a role to play in love. Ultimately, Houellebeq will use these bases to explore the meaning of humanity and life itself.<br />The book is nothing if not ambitious. The first half of the book is a raucous success. The author observes the narcissistic side of the 1960s with great insight, and discusses some interesting aspects of genetics, these two elements being his contenders in the fight of nature versus nurture. The second half of the book is mixed. Houellebeq attempts to show his two main characters' struggles through their relationships with themselves and their mother, which generally succeeds, and also through their relationships with women, with less success. The relationships with the women seem a bit contrived. The ending of the book was quite frankly a sharp left turn into uncharted waters, and left this reviewer very confused, almost browbeaten into accepting a conclusion that seemed detached from the rest of the narrative.

His tastes run to the esoteric and philosophical, and his relationship with his student, Gambetti, is intellectually mutual. He has just returned to Rome from the wedding of his younger sister, Caecilia, to an \\"obese wine cork manufacturer,\\" held at the family estate in Austria, called Wolfsegg. At the wedding were his parents, older brother Johannes, and his other younger sister, Amelia.<br />He receives a telegram in Rome: \\"Parents and Johannes killed in accident.\\" For the first half of this 320-page book (each half being one unbroken paragraph!), he describes his life, and his narration becomes a deep reflection on his childhood and life to date. He delivers a marvelous psychological portrait of himself, as well as the family members who have just died, and his long-dead Uncle Georg, whom he remembers with great fondness. He hates his family deeply, and the feeling is mutual. He is a philosopher, they are down to earth. He is an aesthete, but they are simple folks. He is a scholar, but they are hunters and farmers, despite their fantastic wealth and their prosperous family estate. Only Uncle George understood him, artistic, free-spirited, and educated. Franz-Josef reflects passionately on his current situation, and tells us many stories of himself and his family.<br />For the second half of the book, he describes the funeral at Wolfsegg. Lacking parents and older siblings, he is now the master of the estate. His sisters look to him for leadership. He must now decide what to do with the estate. Will he move back to Wolfsegg in Austria, a land he loves, but an estate he hates? Will he pass it to his sisters and remain in Rome, a city he cherishes more than any other? Bernhard will stun the reader with the beauty of the resolution, but will do it in his own literary fashion.<br />During the story, we learn Franz-Josef disdains Catholicism and National Socialism (i.e., Nazism) in equal parts. His mother had been having an affair with a Catholic Archbishop in Rome, a relationship which was supposedly secret, but which all her children seem to know of. The Archbishop is a close family friend, and will certainly visit the estate for the funeral. His father had many Nazi friends, unbelievably still openly Nazi all these years after the war. He tells us of the fun times he enjoyed playing at his estate's Children's Villa, and how disappointed he was when it was shuttered. He vows to open and restore it when he is master. He tells us of the five libraries---five!---scattered about the estate, similarly shuttered up, collecting dust despite a half-dozen generations' worth of valuable books stored within. He tells us childhood stories of his parents, his brother, and his sister, all disdainful, and heaps contempt upon his brother-in-law, whose name he cannot even bring himself to utter, in generous proportions. At one point, he bathes in his father's bath, and wears some of his clothes. Is this a metaphor for his feelings? We learn that he blames his father only for being such a simple man, but hates his mother passionately, for dragging his father into the mud.<br />We struggle with the idea that this is an unreliable narrator, and we are only hearing one side of a two-sided story, but unlike Italo Svevo's masterpiece, \\"Confessions of Zeno\\", it is clear that despite this narrator's one-sided story, there is no reason to disbelieve him. He is as critical of himself as of others, and he demonstrates the pettiness and crudeness of his family in many different ways. We trust him, not only because he is self-critical, but because despite his self-confidence, he is not a fool. We also learn some untoward truths about his family, and a few hidden secrets, which cannot be dismissed, even from the most unreliable narrator. His angst comes from a simple sentiment, expressed early on: \\"I can't abolish my family just because I want to.\\" He struggles to resolve the question of extinction: Must he extinguish himself to satisfy his family? Must his family be extinguished to satisfy himself?<br />Finally, after a rollicking narration of heartfelt emotions and deeply-help philosophies, Bernhard's narrator demonstrates how he chooses to reconcile his thoughts and feelings, his inheritance and his sisters, his legacy and his future, and all the elements demonstrated through the length of the novel braid together like a jewel. Bernhard's prose is difficult for those unfamiliar with experimental or cutting-edge literature, but actually not very difficult once one tries. Curious readers will greatly enjoy engaging their mind with this book. If they wish to sample a smaller work before digging into this one, Bernhard's \\"Yes\\" is another masterpiece of style and depth.

His king may request a dirty deed of him from time to time (such as a political assassination), but he will take it one or two steps beyond the request (killing a few extra people in the bargain). He also delights in causing chaos in general. For example, the king does not know his daughter the princess is surreptitiously consorting with the prince of a rival kingdom. The dwarf causes great panic and confusion with this information, leading to quite a painful set of events, all to the dwarf's great pleasure. He even manages to turn the queen against her own daughter, driving her into the deepest depths of anguish through his vicious sadism.<br />The book is permeated with the notion of evil at a distance, and the idea that evil has a mind of its own, never to be controlled by a master, and to be unleashed only at peril. The dwarf is supposedly the king's agent, and may conduct an assassination or two at the king's bidding, but is remote from the king, as if the king were sending a rocket-launched missile to a distant land, and would not feel the consequences of the explosion himself. Unfortunately, the dwarf always manages to cause enough trouble that the king might wish he had not launched his agent in the first place. The rocket always manages to blow back shrapnel, one way or another. Despite orders, the dwarf has his own agenda, arrogant and sadistic, and will interpret his tasks to suit his fashion.<br />Another attribute of the relationship between king and dwarf is that the dwarf is taken almost as an extension of the king himself. While this is to the benefit of carrying out the king's tasks, it reflects badly on the king when the tasks are carried out with collateral damage. The theme of \\"evil at a distance\\" is reinforced through a DaVinci-like character who builds machines of war, but does not wish to stay long enough to see his machines actually being used. He invents them, but their usage is not his concern.<br />It is instructive to reveal at this point that \\"The Dwarf\\" was written in 1945. It is clearly an allegorical condemnation of war and its intruments. The dwarf, i.e., the instrument of war, may be asked to perform a certain destructive task, but may cause more destruction than necessary. He may perform tasks of his own choosing, in order to satiate his own lust for power, control, or damage. He may be unleashed by people who believe they are clever for their schemes, or wise in their rule, but will reflect badly on them after the deed is done. This is a highly effective and thought-provoking novel. The reader will remark on the dwarf's amazingly cavalier attitudes toward the other members of the court, at his shocking sadism, and his chaotic mentality. Lagerkvist shows us that we unleash such demons at our own risk.but does not wish to stay long enough to see his machines actually being used.

Charles has a sexual relationship with Eponine, a woman whose morals approach his, but Eponine is attracted to Robert, making for sexual tension. Worse, Robert is secretly attracted to Eponine, making for psychological tension. We learn early in the book that the story will turn out badly for all parties involved, each suffering in their own way, so it is not revealing a secret to say the tensions in this multi-faceted relationship do not lead to a healthy outcome. The story is told mostly from Charles's point of view.<br />Robert breaks down psychologically, fainting at a church service he is attempting to deliver with Eponine in the congregation. Robert begins drinking heavily, and begins stalking Eponine's home in the dead of night, leaving behind sick signs of his presence. He can no longer discern good from evil, nor morality from immorality, and eventually cracks altogether, leaving town for a hotel on the outskirts, where he stays with two semi-professional ladies of looser morals than Eponine's. The novel twists a few more times from there, then resolves itself tragically.<br />The book is essentially a reflection on morality and cowardice, the latter being the human element required for maintaining morality, but also for being true to one's self, which can sometimes oppose what we believe to be moral. While it has an interesting theme, it is written almost entirely for shock value (or at least what passes for shock value for an author born in 1897, and writing in 1950), but does not convincingly expound upon or communicate its theme to the reader. For one instance, we are never convinced Robert was so pious to begin with. He does not earn his title \\"L'Abbe\\" in our eyes, so we are not affected by his supposed turning away from piety during the book.<br />Bataille has written this book in an old-fashioned style, almost Victorian, using wrenching emotional adjectives, and over-romanticized means of communicating inner thoughts. It is a bit overdone for the \\"been there, done that\\" reader of today, and not handsome enough for the admirer of 19th-century literature. (Also, there is some reference to Nazis near the end of the story. Judging from another Bataille book, \\"Blue of Noon\\", Bataille seems to throw Nazis into the bargain when he can no longer figure out where to go, and when he needs to show someone else as depraved as his other characters. The reference to Nazis is unecessary and superficial.)<br />This is a very short work, 158 pages, written in a halting diarized style in most parts. It's almost a pamphlet, hardly a full book. In the final analysis, this is a sexually frank and morally candid tale, but one that is philosophical and even memorable. It may not be great literature, the ending may be a bit incongruous, and it may read as though it is fifty years older than it really is, but it was an interesting little volume nonetheless. I subtract a star, however, because it is a tiny little book at a full-size price.en this book in an old-fashioned style, almost Victorian, using wrenching emotional adjectives, and over-romanticized means of communicating inner thoughts.

He is a self-centered aesthete, narcissistic, exploitative, self-indulgant, and wholly inconsiderate. He marries to please his father, as if marrying were no more an obligation than selecting a particular outfit to wear for a special occasion. During his marriage, he will treat his wife like fine china, with delicacy, but as if placed on a shelf behind glass, like a porcelain doll, displayed for benefit, but never held or interacted with. After marrying, he escapes plebian, boring France for exotic North Africa, and becomes sick, probably with tuberculosis. (At the time of this narration, TB was considered a disease of the destitute, such as in the opera \\"La Boheme\\", which was modernized as the play \\"Rent\\", and the disease modernized to Aids. His disease may indicate that he slept with prostitutes, or generally consorted with unsavory people.) His new wife cares for him deeply, but he whiles away his time following the lives of the local Arab children, not least the little boys, especially one whom he considers especially cunning.<br />They return to France, and he oversees his inherited estate. He takes more interest in the goings-on of some young men who work on and around the estate, and the intruiges of a poaching problem, than in the actual running of the estate. He fails to even deliver the lectures he promised the local university he would do. He quickly bores of this spot, and his wife contracts sickness as well, so they travel to Switzerland for their mutual health. After two months, he bores again, and they travel to Italy, where he hates Naples, embraces Italian boys, travels more, and this time loves Naples. He picks flowers, but his ill wife is sensitive to their fragrance, so he picks them at night. Bored again, he desires to return to Africa, where his wife sickens further. He finds his local children again, but being two years later, he does not enjoy their company any more, except his favorite boy, and now joining the picture, the boy's older sister. The story continues from there, and concludes soon thereafter.<br />This book concerns a vile creature, but we can read it with great interest nonetheless. This is a great credit to the skill of its author, and is also because we are genuinely interested, as fellow humans, to follow the course of the wife's illness and recovery. Andre Gide has written a masterpiece of a monster, with beautiful language and rich narration.<br />\\"The Immoralist\\" is a morality play, not an existential meditation. This is demonstrated by the narrator's treatment of his wife. As for playing with little boys and neglecting hereditary estates, one can say yes, the narrator is not a great person, but he is living to the best of his ability, and living true to himself within his psychological limitations, even if the results are distasteful. His disdainful treatment of his wife, however, puts the story in a new light, giving us a strong moral touchstone to stand upon, and a compass with which to clearly judge our protagonist. Other existential novels might ask you to understand their protagonist despite their distastefulness, but in order to understand the protagonist of \\"The Immoralist\\", we must understand his treatment of his unhealthy wife, a kindly woman to whom he passed his \\"street disease\\" in the first place, and we are justified in judging how he chooses to resolve the story at its end.

He is supposedly married, but spends his time with similarly amoral women, lacking clothing, inhibition, shame, and even proper hygeine at times. He zips between London, Paris, Barcelona, and Frankfurt, and frankly, engages in nothing but immoral self-satisfying activities in every spot.<br />At various times, he agonizes over his relationships with his wife, his sexual partners, and his deceased mother. He becomes embroiled in a Communist revolutionary plot in Barcelona, with one of his sexual partners, a Jewish woman, involved in its planning and execution. He reveals his necrophilic obsession to two of his partners, further revealing the exact, even more sickening, subject of his obsession to one of them. He has sex, he gets sick, his women have sex, they get sick, everybody has sex, everybody gets sick. For the punchline, near the end of the novel, Bataille throws Nazis into the picture, showing us that all the depravity of fascism is comparable to the depravity he has shown us all along. Though published in 1957, the book was originally written in 1936.<br />This reviewer isn't buying it. Not a word of it. Not the story, not even the \\"1936\\" part. For one thing, the writing style is actually more mature than that of \\"L'Abbe C\\", published in 1950. Bataille is most probably trying to show off that he detected the evil inherent in the Nazis \\"way back when\\". I don't give him that much credit.<br />For another thing, I think he uses Nazis as an easy way to score \\"scary\\" points. One might intellectualize his choice by saying Bataille is trying to tell us that no matter how disgusting humans may act, at least we're not as bad as Nazis. Imagine a murderer begging leniency because he's not a Nazi. He's still a murderer. It seems Bataille is using Nazis to justify the pornography he just wrote, as if the world is such a horrible place that pornography is just another little bit of it, and tries to throw a philosophical wrench into the works, as if saying life is meaningless in the face of all the horrible things fascism is doing to us in Europe, but I suspect it was all done just for the hell of it. I frankly don't see any rhyme or reason to the thematic choices he makes.<br />I have nothing against the depravity or explicit nature of the book. \\"Been there, done that\\", right? It's not even all that explicit, there's probably less sex in this book than the average mainstream novel today, and he's certainly not advocating committing even the slightest harm to anyone. There are a few disturbing or distasteful ideas here and there, but one never gets the sense Bataille really means what he's writing. One gets the sense he's simply trying to come up with every juxtaposition of immoral behavior and social taboo he can, just to tweak the reader's moral compass a bit, trying to get a cheap rise out of his audience. Maybe this was an interesting exercise in 1957 (or \\"1936\\"), but given the state of depravity which existed in Germany during the 1920s, and the state of sexual liberation which swept Europe from the late 19th century through the early 20th century, I strongly doubt it.<br />Perhaps the target reader for this book will be the person interested in twisted versions of 19th-century literature (Bataille wrote like someone living 50 or 100 years before his time), or the works of De Sade (albeit in highly shortened format, this book being only 126 pages).nd tries to throw a philosophical wrench into the works, as if saying life is meaningless in the face of all the horrible things fascism is doing to us in Europe, but I suspect it was all done just for the hell of it.

He enters the kitchen to take his spot, whereupon the present kitchen worker issues a rambling monologue of stunning length and baffling content, then leaves the household for Watt to stay behind. In the first few pages, we are already asking: Why did Watt just show up? Whose house is this? Who is this man in the kitchen already? Why is he delivering this major dissertation? What does it all mean?<br />The rest of the book concerns Watt's service to the master of the house, some of it conventionally narrated, much of it digressive and odd. To explain this book, however, is to sound ridiculous. A certain number of things happen to Watt, he takes a certain number of actions, he engages in a certain number of conversations, and he ends the story in the book in a certain meaningful fashion. The entire story is told in Beckett's trademark effusive style, a rollicking, bizzare, but highly entertaining profusion.<br />The meaning of the book is also classic Beckett: Don't wait for Higher Meaning, because there is none. All his books portray absurd characters doing absurd things, waiting for life to reveal itself, but ultimately realizing that life reveals itself through the living. To answer the questions posed above, the book is compsed like a circle, just like life. At the same time, it's also completely meaningless, just like life.  We go to some place, we stand in some position, we engage with some people, we commit some acts, we turn and commit other acts, and we engage with some other people. Somehow, among all this ballet, the world still turns, and we still live upon it. For all their foolish sounding, Beckett's books do indeed have a meaning, that life is just the living of it.<br />Beckett is a psychological master. His prose style will never be repeated. I'd call him the Babe Ruth or Michael Jordan of literature, a crude analogy, for which we should apologize, but it is one that we hope reflects the major impact of his work on the art, and his primacy among its literary practitioners.<br />Beckett's work is random by no means. It is carefully crafted, and has an internal rhythm all its own. If a reader is willing to take off their shoes and run through the squishy mud of Beckett's life-swamp, so to speak, it is a joy to read and great fun to reflect upon. &quot;Watt&quot; is a good example of his work, relatively short, and relatively simple, but still likely to provoke great consternation among any who are not used to Beckett's gushing and admirable style, but great enjoyment among those who take it on its own life-affirming terms.<br />Beckett is a great writer for those readers who seek a literary puzzle, a semantic challenge, and a story with a surreal whiff, which tells us how wonderful it is just to be alive, enjoying our time on earth. &quot;Watt&quot; is one of Beckett's more accessible and fun works.hael Jordan of literature, a crude analogy, for which we should apologize, but it is one that we hope reflects the major impact of his work on the art, and his primacy among its literary practitioners.<br />Beckett's work is random by no means.

It is an interesting narrative of colorful characters. There are a few tense moments when one realizes the fact that this is the Spain of Franco's rule, and a character runs afoul of the authorities once or twice, but by and large, this is a normal novel with an interesting story to tell. It is enjoyable to read and nice to follow the various characters, but Cela will remind the astute reader in a very subtle fashion, but an unequivocal one, that this is Franco's Spain, an isolated universe of political peril, giving this novel a second tier, a dark cloud which overhangs the proceedings. Readers who enjoy the multivarious tales of small town inhabitants and their common taverns, or readers who enjoy stories of early twentieth-century Spain will enjoy this story particularly.	2002-12-17

His friend, a real-estate agent, sells a highly undesirable plot of land to a Swiss couple, a man retiring from a successful career as a power-station architect, and his female companion, a middle-aged Persian woman. The narrator strikes a friendship with the woman, and finds her his intellectual equal, or at least his emotional one. He wonders why this couple has chosen that horrible plot of land (which his friend had never previously been able to sell), and why they are building an ugly home on it.<br />He begins to suspect the retiring architect does not treat his female companion with as much respect as she deserves. He retreats into his home for a time, trying to get away from the world, in a fit of general agitation and anxiety, but eventually returns to his friends' company, and deepens his friendship with the Persian woman, who seems to be growing apart from her companion. The novel ends with an emotional shock, summarizing the story's happenings, and explaining it in highly dramatic terms.<br />This novel is unequivocally brilliant. Thomas Bernhard (1931-1989) does not employ a style easy to understand at first, but it is worth every ounce of energy invested. For example, he has written this short novel with no paragraph breaks whatsoever. (The book is 135 pages long, but the type is larger than usual and the pages shorter than usual.)<br />Bernhard writes in an overflowing, fulsome style, not unlike Samuel Beckett, full of language, full of description, incessant, and captivating. This is exactly his strategy: he is trying to capture the reader by forcing them to expend so much energy following his text, his narrative, his story, and his unusual style, that the final words of the story will hit the reader like a ton of bricks. This is Bernhard's signature, and this novel is a fantastic example.<br />Any reader should try this novel who is interested in an inventive, experimental novel, but one which does not veer too far from normal story-telling. Berhard's novels, for all their roller-coaster style, are actually quite conventional, and &quot;Yes&quot; is a great introduction to his literary work. His vocabulary is sharp, his characters are well spun, his occasional insights are spectacular, and his stories are intruiguing. This novel is highly recommended for anyone wishing to sharpen their mind, find a new adventure after having enjoyed Beckett's works, or introduce themself to one of the finest writers of the 20th century.eader should try this novel who is interested in an inventive, experimental novel, but one which does not veer too far from normal story-telling.

Martin Amis's &quot;The Information&quot; is the story of a man who lives in modern London, and whose best friend is painfully better than him at almost everything. He is a failing author, and a failing husband. He is jealously obsessed with his friend, and devises all sorts of mean schemes to harm him, both psychologically and physically, calling upon a few unsavory London characters to do the dirty work. These dirty-dealing characters have problems of their own, and some of them draw part of the book's drama to themselves as well.<br />At the end of the book, we know what has happened to our main character, his friend, and their female companions, but there is some question (in this reviewer's mind) as to how the unsavory characters have resolved their own lives. This is important because Amis focuses on it, but does not seem to explain why he does.<br />The writing is sharp as a scalpel. It is readable, witty, accurate, intelligent, and contemporary. Amis's writing skills are remarkable. His characters are also vibrant, people whom today's reader will follow with interest. There are scenes that are laughingly funny, and some that are squirmingly accurate psychologically. If I could only decide what Amis's last scene was on about, I might rate the book higher. As it is, it was a good one-time read, worth reading if only for the sake of Amis's exciting and skillful prose.	2002-12-16

He finds a village, but is tricked into a large sand pit when he asks for a place to stay the night.  He finds an old woman already living in the pit, in a small home.  He discovers the village is constantly fighting the sand advancing against them, and he has been engaged involuntarily in the Sisyphian task of shoveling the sand in order to keep the village clean.  The old woman is also engaged in this task, and they form an unwilling team.  They struggle against each other, the younger man being forceful and brash, the older woman being passive and generally helpful.  The man continually attempts escape, but continually fails.  At the end, the reader will learn whether the man stays or leave, and whether it voluntary or involuntary.<br />The story is an allegory of Japan's post-WWII struggle with modernization and Westernization, as well as the relative merits of classical Japanese culture versus modern Western culture.  Then again, so is just about half of all Japanese literature from the 20th century.  The old woman represents classical Japan, passive but steadfast, the younger man represents modern Japan, trying to run away, and trying to be different from those in his past.  The sand which encroaches on the pit is the rest of the world, the Western world in particular, encroaching upon Japan, and against which the Japanese must constantly struggle.<br />The problem with this story is that a reader would probably never know the point if they did not know the history of Japan, or the fact that half the Japanese literature of the last century agonized over this topic.  The story does not stand on its own.  The allegory of the sand pit is forced, the characters are as unidimensional as match-sticks, unsympathetic entirely, and the cultural conflict is invisible, as though the author expected everyone to know exactly what he was talking about, and fill in the details themselves.  The sand pit is the worst part.  The author is preaching to us that Japan is in a horrible pit, fighting off the rest of the world, encroaching on them, in a fight of &quot;us versus them&quot;.<br />The biggest problem with this book is that its idea is just so wonderful.  An imaginative writer could turn this story into a spectacular opera.  The tableau is dramatic, the situation rife with possibility.  Unfortunately, Abe assumes the reader already knows the details, and does not satisfactorily unfold the drama, flesh out the characters, bring sympathy to the deeper meaning, or communicate the intended principle.  It's as though Abe were speaking at a cocktail party, and said, &quot;you know how Japan is struggling with the west, it's like a young man and an old woman in a sand pit,&quot; causing all his like-minded colleagues to nod their heads.  If you're familiar with Japanese culture, especially of the 20th century and the post-WWII era, you'll love it.<br />Readers less knowledgeable of this period in Japanese history, but interested in exploring this topic further, will enjoy Mishima's short novel &quot;The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea&quot;.  The east/west cultural struggle is limned much more clearly in that work, in fact quite explicitly.  The plot is more powerful, the characters more interesting, the meaning much deeper, and the import more philosophical.  The ending of that book is also much more wrenching, and will force the reader to reflect on this struggle between Japan and the west with great interest.  Mishima has been derided as an &quot;export&quot; writer, i.e., the Japanese writer the west seems most to enjoy, but if the purpose of a writer is to communicate, Mishima succeeds, where Abe does not.  Abe is content to complain, but Mishima seeks to explain.ow exactly what he was talking about, and fill in the details themselves.  The sand pit is the worst part.

An imaginative writer could turn this story into a spectacular opera.  The tableau is dramatic, the situation rife with possibility.  Unfortunately, Abe assumes the reader already knows the details, and does not satisfactorily unfold the drama, flesh out the characters, bring sympathy to the deeper meaning, or communicate the intended principle.  It's as though Abe were speaking at a cocktail party, and said, &quot;you know how Japan is struggling with the west, it's like a young man and an old woman in a sand pit,&quot; causing all his like-minded colleagues to nod their heads.  If you're familiar with Japanese culture, especially of the 20th century and the post-WWII era, you'll love it.<br />Readers less knowledgeable of this period in Japanese history, but interested in exploring this topic further, will enjoy Mishima's short novel &quot;The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea&quot;.  The east/west cultural struggle is limned much more clearly in that work, in fact quite explicitly.  The plot is more powerful, the characters more interesting, the meaning much deeper, and the import more philosophical.  The ending of that book is also much more wrenching, and will force the reader to reflect on this struggle between Japan and the west with great interest.  Mishima has been derided as an &quot;export&quot; writer, i.e., the Japanese writer the west seems most to enjoy, but if the purpose of a writer is to communicate, Mishima succeeds, where Abe does not.  Abe is content to complain, but Mishima seeks to explain.	2002-12-14

(&quot;Pop&quot; because he is highly non-ideological, even depicting ideological subjects in a completely neutral fashion. His works are plain-old nice to look at.) This book is a beautiful representation of his work, chock-full of his painting, from his earliest works to his most recent, printed nicely in full color. It is specifically the catalog for the exhibit of his works at MOMA in early 2002 (which this reviewer attended, with great delight), but the exhibition was so broad, with a wide range of paintings across Richter's full career, the number of paintings in this book is satisfyingly broad.<br />Richter has dabbled in many styles, and continues to produce works to this day, but most often works with abstraction or semi-abstraction. His sense of color is wonderful, and his sense of vision is superb, by which I mean his paintings force you to stop and stare for long periods of time. Many of his paintings are like photographs taken just slightly out of focus. (He uses a projector, but modifies the image just enough to make you know a human did the work.) Their beauty truly makes you look long at them, and their skill makes you wonder how a person can achieve such subtle effects of lighting in painted oil on canvas.<br />This book also contains good explanations of Richter's work, but these can become tiresome at times. The worst is that the reviews and the plates are not indexed very well, so it is frustratingly difficult to find a given work, either in the list of plates, or in the various texts. This is a major disappointment, but never mind. The reason to purchase this book is the art. The text is explanatory enough to teach the reader about Richter's career and work, and serves its purpose well enough.<br />It is not clear whether the reader unfamiliar with Richter's work, or who has not seen it in person, can enjoy this book on its own merit, but for the reader even slightly aware or curious of Richter's career, this is a welcome volume for the library.curious of Richter's career, this is a welcome volume for the library.	2002-12-13
US	52691651	R1OH75JWABUTXY	0679722343	313605737	Confessions of Zeno	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Literary masterpiece, with a final twist.	&quot;Confessions of Zeno&quot; is the journal of a middle-aged man in Trieste, Italy (in the NE, near Croatia, Slovenia and Austria).  He first describes briefly his difficult relationship with his father, and his problems quitting smoking, but then moves to the heart of his narrative, which concerns his life spent with a successful merchant-class family, with whose father he has a business relationship, and whose two daughters he desires a personal relationship.  He courts each in turn, eventually marrying one, but keeps a mistress for a time, and comes to befriend the man who marries the other daughter, even entering into a business relationship with him.  He manages to have a child, and lives a relatively quiet bourgeois existence.<br />The problem is, he is utterly detached, self-centered, and hypocritical.  When we say &quot;business relationship&quot;, we use the term loosely.  He despises honest labor.  Worse, during the various troubles he has with his friends and family, he cannot see it is his personality which causes them.  The book is subtle and clever, describing the story through his eyes, but still making it clear he is usually the trouble-maker.<br />The journal was supposed to have been written for the sake of a psychologist, who is now publishing it to convince his patient he requires more therapy.  For the greater part, it is a generally plain book, with interesting characters who take us through interesting adventures, even if those adventures are made comical by the man writing the tale, unaware what a clown he truly is.  At the end of the book, the book's full effect dawns on us, and we finally understand the psychologist perfectly.  The ending is quite subtle, and this reviewer was shocked enough to need to re-read the last few pages a few times before actually believing what it seemed to say, but the book's message was that much more effective because of this subtlety.  After reading a &quot;plain&quot; book for so many pages, the ending is that much more powerful.<br />The book's style is clear and engaging, the characters well drawn and endearing, and the stories charming.  Many readers will be happy enough to follow this &quot;tragicomic&quot; story for its own sake, but patient and insightful readers will be rewarded with a conclusion that forces them to question what the book had told them all along, and reflect on the meaning of life, love, family, and friendship.that much more powerful.<br />The book's style is clear and engaging, the characters well drawn and endearing, and the stories charming.

Chief Inspector Ploeg is shot and killed in the winter of 1945, in Nazi-occupied Holland.  He was a cruel collaborator with Holland's Nazi occupation force, and was assassinated by Bolsheviks on a street where four houses stand.  His killers will run away in the dark of night, but Nazi troops will assault the home of young Anton Steenwijk, killing his parents and brother.  This is because Chief Inspector Ploeg's body was found in front of their house.  It had been moved there after the murder.<br />Anton spends the rest of the story trying to discover the exact events of that night, including why the body was moved before his house.  He is reluctant to discover this past, because the memory is painful, and he almost does not want such illogical evil to have a logical explanation.  Anton lives the second half of the twentieth century as normally as he can, encountering Ploeg's bullheaded son, and the various people who had also lived on his street, one at a time, with many years passing between each meeting.  Near the end of the twentieth century, closer to the modern day, he encounters one of the people who knows the full story of the moved body, and Anton finally understands the mystery.<br />The book's ending is both poetic and shattering.  We immediatly empathize with the innocent people who had lived in those four houses, and we decry the horrible mental torture which encompassed them after WWII.  The events of that evening were caused by one hateful group of people murdering the representative of another hateful group, but the ill effects accrued to people who did not deserve it.  Mulisch might be telling us that evil is a cancer.  The actors in the main event, Ploeg, the Nazis, and the Bolsheviks, were the evil ones, but the four innocent households suffered.<br />To describe the way evil imprisons the innocent, Mulisch asks us to reflect on a classic moral quandary: He uses the allegory of a person who comes across a dual execution, and is given the choice of killing one person in order to save the other.  He seems to be asking us, how can one blame an innocent person for choosing the lesser of two evils?  Is it that person's fault, or is it the fault of the encompassing evil?  While this is not what happens in the book, it is only a story Mulisch tells, but it is similar in moral depth, and Mulisch portrays and resolves his own dilemma in a fascinating and effective fashion.<br />This is a well-written book, sharp and concise, with interesting and sympathetic characters.  Mulisch tells us a good story about every-day people, with a deep moral message at its core, and resolves it in a way that will have thoughtful readers reflecting on the nature of good, evil, chance and morality.of killing one person in order to save the other.

US	52691651	R3EJ82I6H8GLOR	0679750185	147498198	The Cement Garden	Books	5	20	21	N	N	The Psychological Meaning of Social Normalcy	THE CEMENT GARDEN is the gripping story of a small family, isolated from society, and struggling with events for which society maintains strict rules. It is a well-crafted reflection on society and normalcy. It is technically well-written, poetic and confident in tone, a superb psychological portrait.<br />Four children, who previously lost their father, now tend their ailing mother, whom they will soon lose as well. Two boys and two girls (two young and two teenaged), they attend school as normal, but the family has always been isolated. The mother hardly let them leave the house when she was alive, so they do not know how to handle her body now that she's died, and take it to the basement. As a subplot, the older boy and girl explore sexuality with each other, in a candid scene.<br />Suprisingly, we are not bothered by these activities as such. McEwan's psychological portraits are convincing, and his characters seem entirely normal. His writing skill is evident when one realizes the sympathy with which these four characters are drawn.<br />The novel's tension comes unexpectedly from a banal source: The older girl has a boyfriend, a conventional person, but McEwan has convinced us the family is normal, so to us, the boyfriend is an outsider. How will the boyfriend act? Will he discover the secret? If so, will he reveal it? Will he become an insider, will he clean up the mess and help the four become legitimate, will he blackmail them, or will he tell society and let them be punished as normal? If the latter, will society punish them harshly?<br />At the end, one wonders how horrible the youth really were, even if they lived outside social norms. What is the line between innocently mistaken and socially unacceptable? The novel is an excellent exploration of this question, and the inquisitive reader may judge this matter for themself.<br />A minor complaint: I have heard the movie omits the book's last paragraph, which I think was wise. The author might have witheld the explicit conclusion, forcing the reader to guess what might happen. This does not detract from the book's quality in any way, nor the reader's ability to consider the matter in their own mind, on their own.the explicit conclusion, forcing the reader to guess what might happen.

It draws upon the same &quot;glory versus comfort&quot; themes which are scattered on almost every page of Ernest Hemingway, but turns to them darkly, like the hounding demons in Thomas Mann's Death in Venice.<br /> The author was indeed an extreme right-wing royalist and traditionalist---he did indeed lament Japan's lack of a paternalistic vision of glory after WWII, maintaining his own private army of 100 samurai-like warriors, and culminating in a &quot;suicide of glory&quot; to protest his view of the weakening post-war Empire of Japan---but far from detracting from this book, or making it some sort of &quot;apologia&quot;, this insight informs you and haunts you even further as you read this book.<br /> You see quite clearly his struggle between the married comfort of the Western world and the glorified struggle of his conception of &quot;true Japan&quot;, but this does not make the book one-dimensional, simplistic or over-written by any means.  On the contrary, it is notable how well he paints a picture which allows the reader to enter the debate for themself.<br /> It is a haunting book, and even when one does not agree with its outcome---indeed, ESPECIALLY when one does not agree with its outcome!---it causes the reader to reflect and perhaps even agonize over its conclusions long after it has been read.<br /> It provoked the same lingering emotions in me as the famous Hemingway short stories &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot; and &quot;The Capital of the World&quot;, and as stated above, the Thomas Mann book, Death in Venice. For its ability to stay in my mind long after the pages are closed, I give it my highest rating.<br /> Shame on the other reviewers who toss this book aside without making the obvious connection to Hemingway and his own hard-headed (and perhaps silly) concentration on glory, but one that literary history recognizes and indeed celebrates. Hemingway was also, like Mishima, a victim of his own suicidal and glory-obsessed mind; and the knowledge of this fact increases the power of his fiction as much as the knowledge of Mishima's life does his. What's good for Hemingway must also be good for Mishima.<br /> I have read a few other Mishima books, and I find this the most thought-provoking and effective I have read.  I dislike the translator's use of silly old-fahioned expressions like &quot;Sonny&quot; and &quot;right you are&quot;---as well as the use of obsolete words like &quot;bedizening&quot; &amp; &quot;calcimined&quot;---and frankly, Mishima's prose is not as beautiful as it is in other works like Spring Snow, but the writing is not poor by any means, and in the final analysis, its ultimate effect is much greater than that other work.also, like Mishima, a victim of his own suicidal and glory-obsessed mind; and the knowledge of this fact increases the power of his fiction as much as the knowledge of Mishima's life does his.

US	52691651	R2T2LRI4KF23IS	0140152741	435955476	Mao II: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Madness of crowds, and men who manipulate them.	\\"Mao II\\" (1991), by Don DeLillo (b. 1936), is the story of Bill Gray, a reclusive novelist. He lives off royalties, supporting Scott, a live-in secretary, and Karen, a young lady with whom both men have a comfortable relationship. Bill is a hermit, supposedly working on a new book, but never appears in public or contacts anyone. Scott is his household helper, but also cajoles him when he gets lazy. Karen is a credulous and sensitive person who was a Moonie in the past, and finds individual life difficult.<br />Bill's agent tells him he has been asked to meet a terrorist group in Beirut, which has taken a hostage. He is to read a statement of support, at a London press conference, and the hostage will be released. He goes to London, but after some difficulties, steals away to Cyprus, unbeknownst to his agent, or to Scott and Karen. He accompanies a sympathizer of the Maoist group, hoping to meet the leader himself, perhaps in Beirut.<br />Will he make it to Beirut? Will he return to America? Will he meet the terrorists? Will he free the hostage, or will he be taken hostage himself? The book will answer these questions eventually, but more interesting are the deeper challenges DeLillo poses. He makes much of Chairman Mao throughout the book. In London and Cyprus, Bill speaks at length with the terror group's sympathizer, arguing over the nature of terrorism, socialism, totalitarianism, and other such matters. DeLillo discusses such organizations as the Shining Path, such world leaders as Khomeini (who died in 1989), and such events as the Tiananmen Square massacres (which occured in 1989).<br />DeLillo seems to ask, what makes a leader? What makes a follower? Why is Karen so credulous? Will she get caught by another cult? Is Scott a leader, perhaps a frustrated one? Why is Bill interested in these matters? Why is a terrorist leader interested in him? Does Bill remain an outsider just so he won't get inadvertently influenced by society's inevitable groupings?<br />Like a contemporary artist, DeLillo doesn't provide a didactic guide, but a curious exploration. He studies crowd behavior and credulity, as well as those (always men?) who manipulate others, or perhaps only superficially attempt it. Most remarkable that he addressed an issue in 1989 which is so relevant today, post-9/11, before Saddam Hussein, another manipulator, became such a household name. DeLillo remains artistically neutral, but seems to have more sympathy for freedom and individuality than group behavior, even though he understands the reasons for the latter. The reader may decide for themself.<br />The prose is lively. The dialog is interesting and idiomatic, if awkward at times, but most often clever. The tone is hustling and bustling, scrambled and chaotic, and contrasted with the literary seclusion of the countryside. This book is recommended for anyone who enjoys contemporary American fiction, or wants to reflect on the nature of crowd behavior, manipulative leaders, or terrorism. It will engage the curious reader and provoke them to thought.a contemporary artist, DeLillo doesn't provide a didactic guide, but a curious exploration.
