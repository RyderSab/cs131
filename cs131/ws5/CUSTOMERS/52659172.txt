The story is of an affair between a married woman and a monk in training. After meeting briefly, they initiate a relationship. I loved the build up of the Thorn Birds, but found this story hard to believe. I didn't feel drawn to the main character... I did finish it so for that I gave it two stars... (if a book is REALLY bad I don't even finish it)	2005-09-25

I had no idea Eva Le Gallienne was a famous theater actress, director etcc... I read this and her other autobiography, and you get absolutly no idea of her real personal life. She mentions she is not going to give up any dirt basically. But because of the times or whatever, you can't even tell she is a lesbian in this book, or any of her problems with alcohol or problems with her half sister... and just tons of stuff about her that I am currently finding out while I am reading a biography of her. The biograpies give you the dirt and are a lot more interesting..	2005-07-14

It is during the same period of time I grew up, the 80's, but in a small rural town. It is a story of a flower growing out of weeds, a young girl growing up with a single mom whom makes bad choices but is still likable and kind. Very nice touching book.	2004-09-25

It was similar in mood to The Lovely Bones. Somewhat dark and painful.

I really enjoyed this book because many times I have wondered what the Hell's Angels were really like and what they were about. This book answered my questions in an entertaining and engaging way. The Hell's Angels had  such a bad rap for so long but you can see in this book that some of the  rap was deserved some was not. This group of men (Unfortunatly no women  allowed..well I would never join a club like that ..since I can't ha  ha.)would die for eachother and you have to respect their loyatly and  brotherhood. I am surprised the author sounded kinda down on Harley  Davidson, I always assumed they all LOVED harley's like I do. Learned  interesting tid bits.. I wish I could meet him at his book signings but I  will be out of town. Cool Book!	2000-06-12

For some reason, I had a little trouble getting started or warming up to this book. Mrs. Hornbacher seemed to spend a lot of time quoting text books, but once I got into the 'meat' of her story, I was amazed and  horrified. I think I saw a little tiny bit of me in her. She is right in  that every woman that I know is aware of her weight and it is a popular  topic and concern. Her concern was to the extreme, eating mustard as a main  course! Well written once past the beginning.	2000-06-04

I found this book very interesting because Cybil really showed all sides of herself. Like Cybil said, it would be tempting to cut out all the bad stuff and make yourself look like an angel. But this book is really no  holds barred. She shows the negative as well as the positive and that I  admired. She did have a liking to married men and sex which I don't think  many people will approve of but she still comes across as someone you'd  like; perhaps difficult but definatly likeable. I did think while reading  this, my goodness she is a nymphomaniac! But then I think she is just  honest, I am sure the majority of famous people sleep with even more than  her by far. Maybe we have a double standard because she is a woman. Anyway,  the reading was fun and light yet sometimes insightful. Here is a beautiful  woman that got a lot of things easy because of her looks, but yet still  human.	2000-05-14

Very interesting subject matter. I can't believe that back only a decade or so, Dr. Money's ideas were accepted. (Some people accept them even today) That doctor appears to be a twisted  pedophile to me.<br />I liked that this book treated the boy's parents as good  people, they made a mistake but they did what they thought best at the  time. It was in his 'hardware' to be a boy. She would get in trouble for  peeing standing up; that was just one of the examples how nature programmed  him not nuture. He knew he was a boy even though everyone told her  differently. It is facinating that this unfolded so recently in our  history!<br />Although I liked the subject matter, I would have liked even  more on 'Brenda' growing up. It was about 1/2 about Brenda and 1/2 about  Dr. Money. There were a few other case studies, I am sure the author had  trouble getting people to discuss the matter, but would have liked a few  more.	2000-04-02

I have ALWAYS held The Ramsey's to be guilty in my mind. This book did make me think again. I happened to be home alone while I was reading this and I felt like checking in the closets and under beds. So therefore, I am  at least entertaining the thought there was a outside intruder. The book  addresses a lot of the rumors that had stuck in my brain as truth, that  might not be so. For example, that John was having an affair while Patsy  was sick, or why they chose to put on JonBenet's tombstone 12/25 instead of  12/26, and just various tidbits that showed there side of the story. <br />I  enjoyed how the book was written. It moved easily between Patsy's  perspective to John's. It was interesting to see the two's different  personalities from a cancer surviving beauty queen to a computer mogul. The  book was not preachy like, &quot;The Tragedy and the Truth' was which was  written by one of their friends.<br />My last thought was that it is sad that  we can not just believe someone when they say they are innocent but people  lie. Look at Clinton saying he did not have relations with Monica, or that  woman, Susan Smith who drowned her children but cried and protested her  innocence.<br />I don't know how I feel about the case now but I hope that  this case is one day resolved!	2000-03-26

Books	2	18	28	N	N	Not a well rounded book	If you are looking for an unbiased look at the case, read Perfect Murder, Perfect Town not this one. This is 'propaganda' from Patsy's friend, just how wonderful her friend is. Heh, a lot of times when people who knew  murderers are interviewed they say they seemed like nice people etcc.. That  Patsy is a good friend, mother, sister etcc.. does not eliminate her as a  suspect in my mind. I am 99.9% sure she did it from reading other books and  looking at the facts. Therefore it is hard to recommend this book except  for the great photo's that only someone on the inside could get.	2000-02-11
