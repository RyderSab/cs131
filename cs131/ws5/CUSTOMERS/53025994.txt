US	53025994	R2LGCN10WEHMMW	0321334094	52532043	Real World Camera Raw with Adobe Photoshop CS2	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	Fabulous	An incredibly helpful book -- and, in my view, the repetition helps because it fixes in the reader's mind mechanisms that although complex get less so when seen again from different prospects.<br /><br />Until I read this book, I passed through the Camera Raw interface with only superficial focus. Fraser explains the reason Camera Raw is \\"the\\" place to make most of the adjustments (where they are non-destructive), leaving the Photoshop engine for fine-tuning and automation (for those who process many digital photographs). As he notes, half-joking, a friend of his called PhotoshopCS2 a \\"plug-in\\" for Camera Raw.<br /><br />Using Fraser's book to both (1) understand the power of Camera Raw; and (2) use the Camera-Raw techniques he explains so well (with step-by-step screen-shots), will give every serious photographer the best images possible. Well worth the price!	2005-09-15

After our post 9/11 invasion of Iraq, Steven Vincent, a freelance reporter and art critic living and working in New York, wanted to learn more about that country. So he went there.<br /><br />Vincent went to Iraq, not as an embedded journalist largely ensconced in the relative safety of the fortified and heavily guarded Green Zone, but as a vagabond, exploring Iraq's chaotic and lawless Red Zone and its people. In the Red Zone gives us  a prospect rarely viewed. And Vincent returned and returned to Iraq's Red Zone, to learn and write more--to try to explain more. In the Red Zone is a precious journal of what he saw and what he learned; it can teach much to us and to our leaders.<br /><br />In the Red Zone is an incredibly insightful book, drawing not only upon Vincent's cabbing it, unarmed and without bodyguards, throughout Iraq, but also on his research into the country, its people, its at-each-others'-throats religions, and tribal fissures. A supporter of the our invasion of Iraq, Vincent says there is plenty of blame for the current, seemingly intractable mess, not the least of which is what he sees as our country's failure of will to do all that is necessary to complete the job and help the Iraqi people to \\"escape the dungeon of their history.\\" Vincent sees that history as a black hole of misogynist (that suppresses the potential contributions of half the Iraqi population) martyrdom-infused, malevolence.<br /><br />In an eerie foreshadowing, Vincent describes a talk he gave to budding Iraqi journalists, now freed from Saddam's spiked yoke, telling them about how important a free press is to a functioning democracy. One of the young Iraqi reporters later told him: \\"You talk about freedom, but Iraqi journalists are still not free. If we go too deep into some stories, we will anger certain people-and they will kill us.\\" True to that warning, Steven Vincent was murdered in Iraq, and speculation ranges from his writings linking Iraqi police to the Islamic fanatics seeking to destabilize the post-Saddam Iraq, to Vincent's friendship with a Muslim woman translator.<br /><br />Vincent tells us that he was fully aware of the dangers, which finally exploded in a hail of bullets that silenced his voice. His reportage remains, however, not only to warn us of the layered dangers that face Iraq's future, and ours, but also to  give us possible paths for their mediation and conquest. We ignore In the Red Zone at our peril.atics seeking to destabilize the post-Saddam Iraq, to Vincent's friendship with a Muslim woman translator. <br /> <br />Vincent tells us that he was fully aware of the dangers, which finally exploded in a hail of bullets that silenced his voice.

Lowenthal, a law professor in Arizona, spent his sabbatical as a prosecutor in the Phoenix (Maricopa County) prosecutor's office, the office of County Attorney Rick Romley, who, according to his web site, has held office since 1989. Surprisingly na√Øve for a law professor who says he has taught criminal law and criminal procedure,  Lowenthal tells a tawdry tale of expediency and laziness that permeates that office.<br />The book is thus a must-read because it exposes a plea-bargaining-based expediency that not only encourages crime by failing to adequately punish and deter criminals, but also extorts guilty pleas from persons who may not be guilty. The excuse is that plea bargaining saves money and resources. There are two main reasons why that is not true: (1) criminals who plea-bargain their way out of prison are free to continue to prey on their communities; and (2) revolving-door \\"justice\\" means that the same criminal has to be processed over and over again.<br />As Lowenthal admits time and time again, however, it is just plain easier to plea-bargain a case with an offer of  often unjustified leniency than to try the case and get the justice the defendant, the victim, and society deserves. For most defense lawyers, of course, plea bargaining is the only way they can make a buck-it just doesn't pay for them to spend the time and effort defending their clients in a trial.<br />Although the book's main focus is a case that Lowenthal did try, the real story he tells is about the lame excuses he and his fellow prosecutors marshal to justify either not charging crimes (including one Lowenthal declined to charge even though the police arrested the defendant red-handed in a stolen truck) or to justify probation for folks whose crimes warrant lengthy prison terms. \\"Down and Dirty Justice\\" paints an ugly picture of how justice is bartered in Phoenix. If accurate, Phoenix should get itself a new chief prosecutor.	2004-05-03

I was  enjoying Canaries in the Mineshaft until I came to page 127, where Ms. Adler wrote:<br />\\"...[Justice] Stone, speaking for a unanimous, far from `liberal' Court in 1938, in footnote 4 of U.S. v. Carolene Products-the most important footnote in American judicial  history.\\" Adler apparently did not read the decision.<br />First, the decision was not \\"unanimous.\\"  Justice McReynolds dissented. Second, Justice Butler only concurred in the result. Third, Justice Black wrote that he did not agree with that part of Stone's opinion that contained footnote 4. Fourth, neither Justice Cardozo nor Justice Reed participated in the decision. This means that the famous footnote 4 was agreed-to by only four of the nine justices-hardly a \\"unanimous\\" expression by the Court, as Adler says.<br />As Adler points out earlier in the book, in connection with an error made by another author, errors cause a reader's faith in the author to \\"unravel.\\" Here, the error was not caught in 1987, when the article first appeared, or, recently, when Canaries was cobbled together.<br />Frankly, I stopped reading when I got to page 127 because I could no longer trust anything in the book to be accurate.

This is a quick read, and some of the funny stories will make you chuckle -- if not laugh -- out loud. But, sadly, there is a lot of unfunny filler--tales of young lawyers whose representation of their trusting clients was poor indeed. Moreover, some of the material--the amusing excerpts from court and deposition transcripts--come from a book published by a court-reporter association (&quot;Disorder in the Court&quot;) and have been on the internet rounds for so long that the excerpts have fairly heavy beards.<br />Perhaps the most poignant selection, however, is the recollection by a South Carolina lawyer of his lawyer-father's observation that the more a thief stole the better he was treated by the court and the more lenient his punishment--ranging from the ...  crook to the ... embezzler. That tale, of course, echoes, sadly, what the law is all about: summarized by Swift centuries ago when he said that the law was like a cobweb that ensnared small flies but let the hornets through.<br />All in all, Shark Tales is worth the flitting moments of time it takes to read.	2001-03-23

Three-foot-long worms in swordfish, a careless kitchen crew tossing perhaps open mussles into the pot, blood and lord-knows what else spurting  in the kitchen ... these and other tales about which most of us suspected  but never really knew, abound in Kitchen Confidential. It is a modern-day  Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell's witty intrusion into the  muck-laden three-star kitchens of his era.<br />The book is a funny,  multi-dimensional, personal journey of a talented chef through cuisine's  netherworld. Although some reviewers disliked the frenetic style, it was  resonant with the frenetic pace of restaurant kitchens. Kitchen  Confidential is not only a fast-paced page-turner, but, indeed, it was one  of the few books that I was sorry to see end. Bourdain is a marvelous  writer ... conversational and witty.<br />Amazon tells us that Bourdain has  two novels in the pipeline ... I can't wait until they are formally  published.

He paints, with striking realism, the paradigm corrupt court  house as well as what it takes to restore honor to those places--a dogged  pursuer who uses every weapon available.<br />Turow, a master in his own  right, has, I am happy to say, also picked up the torch of superb  character-development from the late George V. Higgins -- who's finest work  of his genre was Change of Gravity.  Personal Injuries similarly gives us  realistic, multi-dimensional, powerfully-drawn characters in an intriguing  tale.

As with Word of Honor (which rivals Arthur Koestler's &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;), Cathedral, and Charm School,  Lion's Game shows that DeMille is able to weave seamlessly prescient and  biting social and political commentary with superbly plotted page-turning  urgency. It is a shame that &quot;literati,&quot; who tend to disdain  fast-paced fiction (preferring the latest restrospective on The New Yorker  -- or the generally plodding, angst-driven &quot;coming of [intellectual,  sexual, spiritual, etc.] of age&quot; indulgencies), have pigeon-holed  DeMille as a &quot;mere&quot; &quot;popular&quot; writer. Simply put,  Lion's Game proves that a writer can be &quot;deep&quot; without be boring.  DeMille is a master --- a multi-dimensional master. Lion's Game is one of  his best!
