And I don't mind the conversational tone and profanities.  What bothers me is the repeated errors in Hunt's book.  For example, contrary to Hunt's assertion, the Patriot Act has nothing to do with holding Jose Padilla as an enemy combatant.  Zip.  Zero.  Nada.  (As Hunt might put it himself.)  Just a little research, like actually reading the opinions in Padilla's case, would show that the U.S. government has not cited a single provision of the Patriot Act as justifying his detention.  Instead, it is the President's war powers under Article II of the Constitution that are at issue.  How can you call yourself a \\"terrorism expert\\" and get stuff like this wrong?

My only criticism is one I also had for his previous book, \\"Losing Bin Laden.\\"  Minter's approach is essentially journalistic, but what is really need is to approach the material from the perspective of a counterintelligence analyst.  Many of the things we are being told by detainees are intentionally deceptive, and our Arab allies use of harsh methods doesn't change this.  We also need to be aware that CIA's reliance on liaison arrangements with Arab intelligence services creates a significant risk that the information we receive is slanted to protect the regimes they serve.

The case is, of course, circumstantial, but such is the nature of intelligence.  Critics of this book, and Mylroie's work in general, will reply with the &quot;there's no evidence&quot; refrain, but there is evidence, such as the trial exhibits recreated in this book.  If you read it, you will discover that analysts arguing against Iraqi involvement in the terror network aren't arguing about evidence: they're ignoring it.  Their evidence is &quot;well, Yousef told us he wasn't working for the Iraqis.&quot;  He told us!  Can you believe it?  This is what American intelligence has come to.

It is difficult to overstate the importance of this book in intelligence scholarship.  It is perhaps the only book that gives, essentially from the horse's mouth, James Jesus Angleton's approach to analytical counterintelligence.  This approach was driven from CIA when Angleton was fired in 1974 as part of the Church Committee witch hunt.  Angleton's seemingly simple insight -- that our enemies, as thinking, breathing human beings, may actually go out of their way to feed us false intelligence, so that we will believe things that aren't true -- has been totally lost to CIA for almost 30 years.  Instead, it has been replaced with a naive faith that CIA is simply to smart and professional to be fooled.

I think a number of these events are distant enough that a little analysis and perspective are in order.  Therefore, I didn't find this book as informative as Laurie Mylroie's 2 books, for instance.  Miniter's less analytic approach is least effective when examining the factual specifics of each terrorist attack.  For the most part, he is relying on newspaper accounts of who the participants were in the conspiracy, what each did, and what his motives were.  This is problematic, because any familiarity with the phenomenon of Islamist terrorism in the 1990s will encourage you to be on your guard: both the terrorists and their sponsors have obvious incentives to lie and much of what passes for common knowledge has been initially disseminated to produce certain effects.  Even various factions in our intelligence bureaucracies (CIA, State Department) are pushing specific agendas.<br />The book is better in providing insights in linking the terror campaign of the 1990s to events in the Clinton White House and Clinton's own political objectives at any given time.  I think Miniter accurately concludes that the Clinton administration was not serious about this threat and lacked the will and talents needed to prosecute the war effectively.<br />As an aside, one reason I bought the book was the Annex summarizing the evident of coordination between Iraq and Al Qaeda.  Oddly enough, Miniter has done a better job in some of his newspaper pieces summarizing this evidence than what is found in this book, which is far from comprehensive.	2003-10-08

No one did more to make it worse than the \\"post-modernists\\" who arose in the 1960s, who took Sartre's and Heidegger's bankrupt philosophies as their point of departure.<br />There is no greater post-modernist than Jacques Derrida.  His co-author, Jurgen Harbermas, is lionized in European and American universities (including the law school I went to).  Their teaming up to spin out a farrago of nonsense in the wake of 9/11 is a sign that some people cannot overcome their tremendous arrogance to know when they are wrong and should shut up.<br />Derrida and Habermas are directly responsible for our \\"intelligentsia\\" being unable to accept the fact that people are trying to kill us and we need to fight.  If you are looking for a reason to roll over and die, to give up every human value that people have ever fought for, then this is the book for you.  If you still have any common sense left, run away from it as fast as you can.  And remember who Derrida and Habermas are: the people most responsible for the ascendance of up is down/right is wrong moral relativism and the continued decline of our culture.	2003-09-25

Instead, it has been replaced with a naive faith that CIA is simply too smart and professional to be fooled.<br />Codevilla, from years as a Senate intelligence staffer, knows otherwise, and he chronicles one blunder after another.  The lesson: since few if any of Codevilla's proposals were implemented, when CIA says something does or doesn't exist, you should be very, very skeptical.  CIA has secret intelligence right?  They know things we don't, right?  Wrong.	2003-08-27

The scandal is that CIA had very few people like that in the past.  Let's hope that's changing.  The vignettes in the books that describe his actual intelligence operations are very interesting, giving you a sense of what it must be like to be a CIA officer on station in Central Asia.<br />Unfortunately, the analytical portions of the book are quite disappointing.  Baer isn't really a deep thinker, and he doesn't appear to know as much about the subjects as he should.  Most bothersome to me is that Baer's view of Islamism (or Islamic fundamentalism), while radical in the 1980s when everyone was focused on the Soviet menace in Afghanistan, is really just the conventional wisdom in Washington today.  Every talking head on TV or policy wonk will tell you how dangerous the forces of Islamism are, whether in the guise of Al Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood (Baer's preferred term), Islamic Jihad, Wahabbism, or whatever.<br />What you don't hear a lot about is the connection between these movements and the nation states in which they operate.  Baer talks about Saudi Arabia and their support for Islamic radicalism in general.  He repeats allegations made in the press (for example, about connections between Princess Haifa and 9/11), but doesn't present a detailed case that any particular terrorist operation received Saudi support.  He does not discuss the role of other states, and worse yet, holds up Syria (of all places) as a model of a successful approach to cracking down on Islamist terror.  Has Baer heard of Syria's support for Hizb'allah in Lebanon?  Does he know that Hamas and PIJ operate openly in Damascus?  How about Syrian Islamist volunteers in Iraq?<br />No, the problem isn't Islamist terror, per se.  The problem is that almost all of the states in the modern Middle East (save Israel and Turkey) have a history of using Islamist terror groups as proxies in battles between each other and with the West, Russia and India.  This is true whether or not the state in question is itself fundamentalist (Iran, Sudan) or secular (Iraq, Syria, Libya, Pakistan).  Baer's instance that the \\"real problem\\" is Islamist militancy, and not the combination of both Islamist terror with state policy, that continues to obscure the problem we face.<br />After reading this book, I'm not convinced that Saudi Arabia is more dangerous than any of the others.  It at least is not openly hostile to the U.S.  There appear to be some elements in the government that would like to be openly hostile to the U.S.  But they aren't calling the shots yet. Until they are, calling for things like seizing the oil fields is premature.  To paraphrase Don Rumsfeld, like Osama bin Laden, Saudi Arabia is a problem, it is not the problem.	2003-08-27

I kept having to remind myself to take everything with a grain of salt, because very few people believe Bodansky's account of an over-arching Islamist conspiracy at the beck and call of Iran, Sudan and Pakistan.  It's OK to have unusual theories, but you need to support them with facts.  And Bodansky cites no sources for his assertions, because presumably its all from secret operatives within Al Qaeda, Hizb'Allah, Pasdaran, MOIS and ISI.  This would make Bodansky more plugged in than George Tenet, because the CIA certainly doesn't think any of this is true.  If Bodansky's right, then it is a scandal that U.S. government policy ignores the fact that Al Qaeda is just a small part of the multinational Islamist movement that operates at the direction of Iran, Sudan and Pakistan.  If Bodansky's wrong (as I would suspect), then it is an embarrassment that a man who would write a book like this was the head of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare.

I especially recommend this book to people who have not been following the various alternative investigations being conducted by independent researchers and the alternative press.<br />Unfortunately, however, this book is not a comprehensive summary of all of the evidence for/against various variations of the hypothesis that a missile brought down Flight 800, or a comprehensive summary of all of the evidence for/against the NTSB's center tank theory.  Such a book, while much longer, more detailed and infinitely more difficult to write, is what someone who has followed the investigation is really looking for.  Commander William Donaldson's preliminary report, available at [...] is more like what we need at this point.  An examination of that report, Sanders' earlier books, and \\"First Strike\\" reveal one of the problems researchers have created for themselves, undermining their ability to get Congress or other public officials to pay attention to them -- their hypothesis about what brought down Flight 800 keeps changing: Navy SAM, terrorist controlled ship-based SAM, terrorist controlled shoulder-fired SAM, etc.<br />In \\"First Strike,\\" it is no a secret that Sanders and Cashill have concluded that both an accidental hit by a Navy missile and a high-explosive laden private jet brought down Flight 800.  This is an entirely new hypothesis, and as other have pointed out, Sanders and Cashill have seriously weakened \\"First Strike\\" by presenting this hypothesis without spending the appropriate amount of time examining the evidence for/against it.  The big objection is, of course, that no debris from a second plane was ever found.  Now, maybe there is an explanation for that, but Sanders and Cashill don't present it.  Similarly, they apparently haven't done any work to determine whether a small 6-seat jet plane went missing in July 1996.  Or to determine the identity of the 6-seat plane spotted on radar prior to the crash.  Maybe there is some aviator out there who can stand up and say, \\"Hey, that was me.\\"  Have they looked for him?  It doesn't appear they have.<br />These sorts of questions seem basic to the hypothesis.  Not having run them down seriously undermines the credibility of this work.  This book may open some people's eyes (i.e., those who accepted the NTSB explanation but are willing to reconsider our government's response to terrorism in the 1990s in light of 9/11), but it's not going to change the minds of anyone in government who might actual do something about re-opening the investigation.  And that's really too bad, because the country deserves an honest answer to the question of what happened to Flight 800.	2003-03-19

In Moravec's desire to make robots people, it seems he has made people robots.	2003-02-11

The first is the straight-talking military scientist, full of practical amd theoretical insights into what works and what doesn't in waging war.  For example, his piece comparing Sun Tzu and von Clausewitz is first rate, and worth the price of admission.<br />However, there is another Ralph Peters, who I find quite frustrating.  And this Ralph Peters, when he writes, moves from an exhilarating clarity to a disappointing lack of precision.  One of his central points is that we can expect more, not less, violence from the Third World in the future, because of the growing income disparity between the rich North and poor South.  In particular, the growing population means that there are more mouths to feed with fewer resources, and that those members of the \\"excess\\" population will turn to violence to protest their poor prospects.  Now, I happen to disagree with this assessement, but the best that can be said is that population and environmental economics are very complicated areas of study, and there is an enormous amount of controversy over whether these problems are in fact getting worse or getting better.  If Mr. Peters wants to venture into this realm, and if he is going to be intellectually honest, he would have to write a book with substantial citations to, and specific data from, the vast literature in these areas (like Bjorn Lomborg's \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\") and he just hasn't done that.  Instead, he writes generalized descriptions of Third World trouble makers, giving few specific examples of the countries, groups or individuals he is talking about, or why their specific situation is making them act as they do.  Reading these pieces is likley to induce a sense of vertigo, as the dire predictions seem intended to generate fear, but give little in the way of intellectual substance.	2002-10-04

Unfortunately, Dr. Pollack's book reflects the institutional prejudices of somone who has worked in the intelligence community and tends to believe the CIA's intelligence assessments. In particular, Dr. Pollack reinforces the following errors that are really damaging to our Middle East policy:<br />- Dr. Pollack discounts Iraq's role in September 11, 2001. The evidence that Al Qaeda received support from a state in conducting the September 11th attacks is really quite compelling, as much as the CIA, FBI or MI6 want to deny it. See Ledeen's \\"The War Against the Terror Masters,\\" Mylroie's \\"Study in Revenge\\" and Edward Jay Epstein's website.  Dr. Pollack simply dismisses these arguments in summary fashion, without making an effort to consider the specific factual details.  He really should have stated that he believes that consideration of the question of Iraqi support for terror, as opposed to its WMD program, is beyond the scope of his book.<br />- The so-called \\"moderate\\" Arab states (Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf emirates), rather than being victims of their people's anti-Americanism, actually encourage it. It is in their interest to hold up America as a scapegoat for their own failings - their tyranny, repression, corruption and murder. They oppose action against Iraq because they fear the liberation of Iraq would cause a liberating domino effect, like the one that brought down the Soviet Bloc.  Dr. Pollack makes obtaining Saudi support on an invasion a prerequisite, ultimately tying our hands.  Worse still, he recommends that an invasion be conditioned on the absence of Palestinian/Israeli violence, giving Saddam an incentive to step-up his support for Hamas and PIJ.<br />- The policy of \\"containment\\" has always been an immoral failure. America should have marched on Baghdad at the end of the Gulf War. Any other action was foolish, no matter how much Bush Sr., Powell, Schwarzkopf and Scowcroft try to explain themselves. America fights for freedom, not cheap oil. Pulling together one of the greatest armies in history and delivering a historically unprecedented defeat, only to leave the job half finished and Saddam in power, was the greatest American military blunder since WW II. See Hanson's \\"Soul of Battle.\\"<br />- Dr. Pollack sees great costs and risks in full-scale military action against Iraq. In fact, we have every reason to believe that Iraq would be crushed quickly and decisively in any conflict. See Hanson's \\"Carnage and Culture\\" and \\"Autumn of War.\\"  Further, Dr. Pollack's description of the conflict appears quite conventional.  I suspect that the campaign that Central Command would actually wage would, like that in Afghanistan, shock observers in its innovation and daring.  Dr. Pollack underestimates the importance of the INC and other opposition groups, toeing the Foggy Bottom line that the democratic opposition is incompetent.  He appears to have personal knowledge, but I wonder about his objectivity.<br />- Politicians who oppose the war, rather than being persons of conscience, are actually appeasers of the Neville Chamberlain ilk. They would rather accept the almost certain risk of more innocent Americans dead than give up their pacifistic, utopian, sanctimonious fantasies. I reject categorically Dr. Pollack's characterization of my position as \\"vicious slander.\\" Al Gore and his ilk are appeasers, and there just isn't any way around that.	2002-10-03

This novel is so bad because Le Guin is not writing it to present an interesting \\"what if,\\" but because she really seems to believe that she can accurately predict what the future should look like.  Here, she presents the future that humanity must accept to \\"live in harmony with nature\\" and to avoid an \\"environmental collapse.\\"  This preachy and dogmatic book is a failure precisely because Le Guin took the future she was predicting so seriously.    One colossal error is her depiction of the warlike Condor.  Essentially, Le Guin expresses her disdain for all soldiers and the culture of civic militarism by depicting the Condor as incapable of making rational decisions.  Once the Condor embark on a project of reclaiming 20th century technology, abandoned by all human cultures in ACH as inconsistent with a healthy environment, they become so fixated on the tank and the jet plane that they throw all of their resources into creating these weapons.  Since the Condor basically operate by subjugating the surrounding subsistence agrarian societies of the new Earth, they simply do not have the economic resources to pursue these projects, and so they fail.  Le Guin has included this completely unbelievable plot twist as a way of overcoming the obvious objection to her proposal that humanity return to a level of technology that pre-dated the industrial revolution: that technology gives nations an advantage in warfare that they would never agree to surrender.  Like any consensual cartel, it would only take one country to break the treaty, and the whole arrangement would collapse.  In reality, the Condor would use industrial technology to build enough assault rifles for a small army, and faced with opposition from native populations armed with little more than primitive clubs, the Condor would conquer the entire planet in a few months.    That the entire premise of Le Guin's book is totally preposterous would not be so bad if the world she depicted were simply a foil for an interesting story that shed light on the human condition.  But the world she has created is an end unto itself, and what's worse, is this is Le Guin's take on the utopia we should all strive for.  This is one of the worst pieces of SF ever written.	2002-05-28

Dr. Tipler's mastery of three separate branches of physics/mathematics (global general relativity, quantum mechanics and computer complexity theory) is truly impressive, and he winds various arguments from these disciplines together in a completely integrated tapestry.<br />The theory of TPOI is a scientifc theory, and needs to be evalulated as such.  I am hoping that Dr. Tipler is at work on an updated edition, which would summarize the status of experimental confirmation of the theory.  Rather than the top quark and Higgs boson results, most people have focused on the results of the High Z surveys of Type Ia supernovae.  Most orthodox cosmologists would express the opinion that these surveys seem to imply a very large \\"cosmological constant\\" that will result a a \\"runaway universe,\\" where the galaxies will accelerate away from each other at faster and faster rates. The Omega Point Theory requires the universe to recollapse in a \\"Big Crunch\\" - the opposite of the Big Bang. There is no consensus, however, that the Type Ia suveys really reveal this.  As Dr. Tipler explained in both TPOI and \\"The Cosmological Anthropic Principle,\\" a non-zero cosmological constant of the magnitude implied by the observations is totally inconsistent with the standard model of particle physics.  Instead, Dr. Tipler and other theorists favor a theory of \\"quintessence,\\" which is essentially a theory of how the energy of empty space can change over time.  When you put that together with all of the other arguments for the Omega Point theory, such as avoiding violations of unitarity, the theory is still as compelling as when TPOI was first published.	2002-05-22

This tape is exactly the reason why psychotherapists are the subject of so much criticism.  Dr. Heitler gives the listener little or no information or insight on what anxiety is, why people have it, or what you can do to alleviate it.  Her random musings are little more than warmed-over pop psychoanalytic cliches of the Frasier Crane variety.  &quot;I'm listening!&quot;  She advises one of her patients that his panic attack in a supermarket aisle was caused by his fear of getting married (i.e., walking down the aisle).  Does anyone really believe in this kind of Freudian mythology anymore?  There is no discussion of the physiological basis of panic disorders, let alone any discussion of how this person would go about alleviating his panic attacks.

It would be difficult to have a sufficiently deep and comprehensive background in general relativity, particle physics and information theory to be able to evaluate the merits of Dr. Tipler's arguments.

Even if I am not in a position to cogently critique the theory presented, I will tell you that many people will find reading this book a tremendously powerful experience, especially if you would like to believe (as I would) that death is not permanent.	2002-03-19
