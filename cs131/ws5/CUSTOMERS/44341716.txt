Before I added my two-cents'-worth to the review pile, I wanted to spend a number of weeks using it as a both a study tool and devotional aid. In order to facilitate this, I actually purchased the digital version from Nelson rather than the print version. My Bible study is primarily done within the Libronix Digital Library System, so this was the most useful format for me. Therefore, my comments relate to content and not presentation in the book format.<br /><br />First off, I am glad that the Reformation Study Bible is offered with the ESV translation of the Bible based on both readability and a good attempt at being a translation that seeks to expose the underlying Greek text. This is my personal favorite translation, and I am happy with the large number of resources being quickly released to help me use this version.<br /><br />My favorite feature of this study Bible is the short essays throughout called \\"Theological Notes.\\"  In my opinion this Bible is worth its purchase price for these notes alone. Let me give you a flavor of what they cover by listing some titles:<br /><br /> -The Image of God<br /><br /> -Body & Soul, Male & Female<br /><br /> -The Fall<br /><br /> -God's Covenant of Grace<br /><br /> -Infant Baptism<br /><br /> -The Baptism of Jesus<br /><br /> -The Unpardonable Sin<br /><br /> -The Transfiguration of Jesus<br /><br /> -Hell<br /><br />Next, a very large number of in-text maps are provided which make for excellent resources. Since they are presented in the context of a certain passage of Scripture, they are much more useful than the maps often provided at the end of Bibles or in Bible Atlases. The editors' hard work is obvious in making the maps easy to use to understand the text with which they are presented. Great work here.<br /><br />Many charts are also included which help get a birds-eye view of the text, especially when large amounts of information are presented throughout a number of chapters or when a logical progression of thought is particularly important or difficult to follow. The ones that are included are very useful, but I do wish that more charts had been created.<br /><br />I have seen a number of negative reviews based on individual issues with which reviewers disagree with this Bible. I will say that I have come across a number comment with which I mildly disagree or would have wished had been stated differently (discussion of creation). And there are a few topics with which I greatly disagree (infant baptism). Nevertheless, the historical Reformed position is presented, and on controversial issues, the opposing positions are mentioned. This is not a downfall of the Bible, in fact, I think that it is a strength. Positions are offered and defended rather than simply presenting innocuous historical fact or some inoffensive application as many other study Bibles do. Nevertheless, for that reason, if I was looking for a Bible as a gift to a learning believer which I would agree with on a wider-breadth of issues I would choose the MacArthur Study Bible. But as a great study tool and a more in-depth Study Bible than MacArthur's I would go with the Reformation Study Bible.<br /><br />[...]d throughout a number of chapters or when a logical progression of thought is particularly important or difficult to follow.

Also, by drawing from a wide variety of sources from a multitude of persuasions he does show effort at presenting as unbiased a presentation as possible. Bradshaw breaks the book up into three basic sections:<br />(1) Development of how Christians were initiated into the Church (quite a bit of work goes into analyzing forms of baptism on this point).<br />(2) The Eucharist or Lord's Supper.<br />(3) The daily and ceremonial disciplines/celebrations that united the Body.<br /><br />The book is very accessible. The scholar may wish for some more detail and probably more thorough documentation. However for the lay reader who is interested in the subject, the format makes it a very easy read.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at this point my compliments cease. I am not writing this review from a standpoint of one very knowledgeable of the archaeological evidence or one intimate in understanding of the primary sources, so I can not speak to his responsible use of those. I do, however, speak from the advantage of one who accepts the Bible (in its autographic form) as the final authority on matters of both history and faith, as both infallible and inerrant, and from this perspective, I am very disappointed in the book. Don't get me wrong. I trust the Bible because of both internal and external evidence to its credibility. But Bradshaw consistently questions Biblical record when they are not consistent with his extrabiblical findings, even if those extrabiblical findings rely on many assumptions and guesses. For example, a number of times he casts doubt on the reliability of Matthew 28:18-20 (The Great Commission) as being added to the text later when there is absolutely no textual evidence of this. According to the Metzger's Textual Commentary, there is no question among the textual critics that the rendering that we have for these verses is autographic. Yet, Bradshaw in true redaction form, flippantly, as if it were common knowledge that these were added, blows them off as not being acceptable as a true saying of Jesus. From this example and others with which I am familiar, I fear for the accuracy and trustworthiness of Bradshaw's conclusions. Therefore, I cannot recommend this book.<br /> -Jacob Hantlaording to the Metzger's Textual Commentary, there is no question among the textual critics that the rendering that we have for these verses is autographic.

That cd, taking a few listenings-to to grow on me set the bar high, perhaps too high because this cd fell short of expectations.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this cd (I only gave it 4 stars because I could not give She Must and Shall Go Free 6). \\"T-Shirts (what we should be known for)\\" took my breath away as it described what I see around me, what I see in me, but could not put into words. \\"Lover Park 2\\" continues where She Must and Shall Go Free left off. I could pretty mention every song on the cd as having at least one very strong point and speaking to my heart at least once in my approximately 20 times listening through the disc.<br /><br />I really didn't like it the first time through (just like his other cd); the second was better; the third even better, as I started to understand what he was talking about in some of the songs. But then it didn't get any better as I continued to listen. Still as I listen to She Must and Shall Go Free, I am captivated and drawn to repentance as I realize just what it means to be a sinner saved by grace, a part of Christ's bride redeemed. That never quite happened with I See Things Upside Down.<br /><br />I know this review is rambling; I usually don't like to do that. I guess that it is just that I can't get my arms around this one.

However, since on most units, medbooks are only available in the medroom and a medbook is too bulky to carry in most cases, the sad fact is that meds are not looked up. My first PDA drug guide was Mosby's, which I have had for over a year; I now also own Davis's. I cannot tell you how many nurses have asked me to quickly look up their meds to see check on dosages, adverse reactions, or nursing considerations. More than one time the meds have been held or orders questioned as a result, but had I not been in the room, the med likely would have been given. How nice it is to have an entire med book electronically available in your pocket, searchable by both generic and brand names (no more flipping through indexes trying to find the generic name), always accessible.<br /><br />So now you are convinced of the necessity of owning a PDA drug guide, but which one should you buy. Like I said, I have owned Mosby's drug guide for over a year and have just recently purchased Davis. I have found Davis' drug guide to be more thorough. Davis is also easier to navigate. Both Davis and Mosby have drop-down menus to quickly jump to the desired section of the med-entry (i.e. mechanism of action, adverse reactions/side effects, compatibility, nursing considerations, client education, etc); however since Davis has the content divided into more subsections, it is quicker to navigate to the desired content. So, my personal choice is Davis, however I do not think you would be amiss to purchase either of these. I only encourage you to move out of the hard-copy med-book and to the PDA version.<br /><br />You may also like to know that you can integrate many other helpful resources such as lab value guides (included in Medical-Surgical Nursing Clinical Companion, ISBN 0323031994), medical dictionaries (Like Taber's, ISBN 080361408X), and more. I hope that more nurses are walking around with entire reference libraries in their pockets resulting in better practice, improved patient outcomes, and reduced errors.<br /><br />________<br />Note: Here was my first review of this product. I had to eventually contact Elsevier and request that they give me a new serial number. Apparently a large batch of cds were shipped to Amazon with incorrect serial numbers. So if you got a bad batch, Mobipocket will not be able to help you, you have to go through Elsevier. Good luck. I would recommend that you not buy this cd and go ahead and get Davis's. The one-star rating is left-over from when I wrote the original review.<br /><br />I purchased Mosby's 2005 Nursing Drug Reference for PDA by Skidmore-Roth over three months ago from Amazon and have not been able to get it installed. The problem lies in the activation process for the title which utilizes Mobipocket Reader Pro. When I go to enter my serial number, Mobipocket tells me that my product has already been activated by somebody else (not true).<br /><br />The above experience can occassionally happen in the use of activation of software and ebooks, an understandable glitch in a manufacturer's system.

When the authors stick to the text, they do a great job of exposing the words of Jesus. However, I have seen that the work is fraught with redactionistic assumptions (deciding Jesus did or didn't say something based on \\"additions\\" or \\"subtractions\\" from the story based on our interpretations of the author's biases). An excellent example of this is found in their exposition of Matthew 22:1-14 and Luke 14:16-24 - The Parable of the Wedding Feast. Ultimately, rather than recognizing that Jesus could have told the same story differently on two occassions or that Luke could have left details out, the authors decide that since Matthew was written post-Jerusalem-destruction, the verses referring to the king sending troops to destroy and burn the city could not have been in Jesus' original words. So rather than actually dealing with the hard words of Jesus recorded in Matthew, they opt to talk solely about Luke.<br /><br />I'm afraid that this sort of thing happens over and over again. So while I have found some helpful nuggets and some deep thinking to challenge my soul, I fear that liberal-leaning of their scholarship makes this text dangerous to use. Nevertheless, with this hermeneutic identified, I do feel that the book can be a useful addition to one's library when used with caution.<br /><br />  -Jacob Hantla	2005-01-23

But in actuality, the book is much more than a narrow-viewed focus on the lives and fates of a few among millions dead in the fierce Pacific battles of WWII.

It is written generally a reformed perspective, but on most issues of controversy all sides are very carefully and adequately explained, citing appropriate references, and only then does Grudem explain why he believes one way or another. Generally, when things are unclear, he states that, which is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Furthermore, each chapter ends with a section hymn and application questions along with a bibliography which can be accessed for more information on any one topic.<br /><br />I have owned the print version (0310286700) of Systematic Theology since early 2002. I purchased the Logos/Libronix version of Systematic Theology (0966090926) and have found that, because of the extensive number of biblical references and references to other works which I have in my electronic library, the format really lends itself to providing the maximum amoung of insight with the least amount of effort. In my print edition I often found myself bypassing extensive Bible verse references out of laziness (Try looking up 75 verses in a row all throughout the Bible on justification and maintain a flow of thought). Now I just drag my mouse over the top of the reference and the verse pops up in the version of my choosing. Also, Grudem references other sections in the theology which are nicely interlinked.<br /><br />My recommendation is that you need to own this book, in print or electronic. If you use Logos/Libronix, it should be a no-brainer to purchase this text; however I would recommend you shop around because at the time of this writing, I found prices much lower at other sites besides Amazon. If you do not use Logos/Libronix I would encourage you to begin using it, but if the cost of the software is too much to absorb, I would recommend you search for ISBN 0310286700 here in Amazon and purchase the print version after reading my review there.<br /><br /> -Jacob Hantlareading my review there. <br /> -Jacob Hantla	2004-12-09
US	44341716	RAW0YAD4FX3G8	3438060108	800489731	A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament	Books	4	51	53	N	N	Extremely Useful Resource; Highly Recommended	This textual commentary is designed to be used in conjunction with the United Bible Societies' (UBS) Greek New Testament 4th ed. and its greatest utility will be found within that scope of use. Nevertheless, there are uses for others, even non-greek readers; however, the utility will obviously be less as this book was not written with you in mind. The pupose of this commentary is best given through a quote from the book's introduction:<br /><br />\\"Most commentaries on the Bible seek to explain the meaning of words, phrases, and ideas of the scriptural text in their nearer and wider context; a textual commentary, however, is concerned with the prior question, What is the original text of the passage? That such a question must be asked - and answered! - before one explains the meaning of the text arises from two circumstances: (a) none of the original documents of the Bible is extant today, and (b) the existing copies differ from one another.\\"<br /><br />The commentary is basically a verse-by-verse list of the all of the verse's identified by UBS as having variant readings in the Greek texts from which the 4th ed was compiled. Without such a tool we are left to look at the readings which were chosen, perhaps the variants which were provided, and guess why UBS made the decision that was made. Looking at variant readings in both English and Greek texts one has very little indication of what sort of weight which variant carries. So, the commentary is basically a verse-by-verse, variant-by-variant list of variant readings along with the determination made by UBS along with the the following categories regarding the certainty of the reading which has been chosen:<br /><br />A: The text is certain<br /><br />B: The text is almost certain<br /><br />C: The committee had difficulty in deciding which variant reading to place in the text<br /><br />Each decision is accompanied by a paragraph-form (often many paragraphs) explanation of why the committee's determination was made in the way it was making great use of major texts and transmission lines.<br /><br />This commentary has proven very useful to me. In my opinion the introduction alone, explaining textual transmission and the issues at hand, is worth the purchase price alone, but once you purchase this commentary and realize its usefulness, it will likely become an oft-referred to member of your library.<br /><br />The only thing keeping me from offering 5 stars to the book is that the only book with a thorough textual transmission introduction is Acts. This is extremely helpful and deals with issues which are only superficially, ignorantly, or inadequately dealt with in other commentaries. I am very greatful for the work of Metzger and UBS for writing it. However, I think that if an intro were available for the rest of the books, the commentary would be very well rounded. Nevertheless, the Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament accomplishes its stated purposes very well and has proven extremely useful to me.<br /><br />  -Jacob Hantlaay it was making great use of major texts and transmission lines.  <br /> <br />This commentary has proven very useful to me.

When Multnomah sent me The Holy Wild by Mark Buchanan, I tossed it into my ever-growing \\"to-read\\" stack thinking that I might get to it some year. But for some reason, I think because I had no clue what a book entitled \\"The Holy Wild\\" would be about, I picked it up and started browsing. When I got to chapter 3 in my skimming I read,<br /><br />A leaf. Behold a single leaf. So fragile, it tears like paper, crushes in your hand to a moist stain, sharply fragrant. Dry, it burns swift and crackling as newsprint, pungent as gunpowder. Yet a leaf may withstand hurricanes, stubbornly clinging to its limb.<br /><br />Hold it open in your palm. It is perfect as a newborn's smile. Pinch its stem between thumb and forefinger and hold it to the light. Eden bleeds through. Its veins are like bone work in silhouette. This single leaf, joined to the tree, drinks poison from the air, drinks it serenely as Socrates downing his cup of hemlock, and refuses to return in kind, instead spilling out life-giving oxygen. This leaf tilts to catch the sun, its warmth and radiance, to distill the heat and light down to the shadows, down to the roots, back up to limbs. To shade the earth. To feed you and me.<br /><br />A leaf. God makes these season after season, one after the other, billions upon billions, from the Garden to the New Jerusalem, most for no eye but His own. He does it faithfully, or else I would not live to tell about it, or you to hear.<br /><br />Perhaps of all my many sins against heaven, this ranks with the worst: Until this moment, I have never thanked God for a single leaf.<br /><br />Which is the problem with faithfulness: We hardly notice it. Faithfulness is, by definition, the predictable, the habitual, the sturdy, the routine. It is the evidence of things seen, but seen so often we've grown blind to them. It is the substance of things expected, expected so unthinkingly that we now take them for granted.<br /><br />It is the air we breathe, the ground we walk on, the skin we inhabit, the way our insides tick and pulse and spin on their own, in season and out, whether we sleep or work or play, without asking us or us having to ask. It is these myriad amazing things: toes and eyes, leaf veins and cloudbursts, bedrock and ozone, seed and sap that by their very constancy and durability have worn familiar or become invisible. The sheer steadfastness of things that surround and uphold us are dull with the caking of the ordinary. We live amidst the surpassing wonders, but most of it has become run-of-the-mill. We dwell among endless miracles that, repeated day after day, have grown tedious. We are lavished with gifts that we now expect or ignore or begrudge.<br /><br />Faithfulness bores us.<br /><br />Who among us leapt up this morning as the sun rose, exclaiming, \\"Look! Look, everybody, look! The sun! Here it comes! Hallelujah, it's here again!\\"? Or who ran through the house shouting, \\"Ha ha! Air! Behold! Air! Clean air, fresh air, air to fill my lungs, air to shape my words, air to move the clouds, air to lift the birds\\"?<br /><br />Not me. I woke up groaning.<br /><br />This chapter stopped me in my tracks and pointed me to my faithful, just, loving, gracious, fear- and honor-evoking God. As I continued to read, many other chapters did the same. Mark Buchanan is obviously an extremely talented writer. Each sentence has been meticulously crafted; his imagery is so vivid that the images, the sounds, the smells, and the emotions that are in his mind when he writes are almost certainly recreated perfectly in the mind of the reader. But this is not reason enough for me to recommend a book. The object of such picturesque and thought-provoking language is God, who give Mark an endless canvas of beauty, wonder, and intrigue from which to draw in his artistic writing.<br /><br />I normally do not read books like this. I can't even define what \\"like this\\" is. But suffice it to say that I would be more likely to pick up a book by Spurgeon, Piper, Mahaney, or Martin Luther than Mark Buchanan or Max Lucado (\\"fluffy writers\\"). But this has been to my detriment. Although, I cannot give this book at 5 star rating because I think that many thoughts are left unfinished and some exegesis incomplete and possibly misleading (Good Samaritan text in particular), I can say that the writing has left me wanting more.<br /><br />Small bits and pieces of God and his character were exposed. God is magnified and glorified by being shown to be who He is, a God who causes us to fear and tremble at the mere mention of His Name, and the God to whom we can run and give all of our cares, concerns, and hopes. Mark helps us discover more and more what he discovered and describes in the last chapter,<br /><br />\\"I have discovered, as I hoped and feared in my younger days, that God is no drab pedant, meddling and puttering, but the Lion of Judah, the Lord of the Holy Wild.

US	44341716	R1YIPQN4BFZF8P	0664227074	783536885	Credo	Books	3	7	41	N	N	Clarification to a previous review...	I was surfing the web not too long ago and saw my name and a reference to the review that I wrote of this book.  I have now added this addition to the original review which I made on March 13, 2004 entitled, \\"Lots of Wisdom and Social Aid; Missing the Gospel\\". I had to remove the original review in order to post this one. Amazon only allows one review per reviewer per item. This is the original review:<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />The Left-Leaning Christian message of the book is very helpful. Christians and Conservative tend to be synonyms in society today. This is often for very good reason, but sometimes Christians get their faith mixed up with the conservatism and end up being reactionaries to liberalism and paganism. They ignore the Gospel--the Good News that Jesus, God, came to earth to take the punishment that mankind deserves for our sin so that eternal life with Him can be offered to those whose only hope is His death--for the sake of conservatism. Unfortunately, the message of Credo is the opposite reaction. Seeing the social justice and aid to the helpless (See James 1:27), the left-leaning wing of Christianity tends to embrace social activism and morality at the expense of what is truly eternally helpful, the Cross of Jesus Christ. So for Christians the message of the religious right and the religious left must be tempered with the Gospel. If you choose to read this book, do not forget what the Christian message really is.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />The title of the blog post to which I am referring was \\"The Cross vs The Social Gospel\\" on \\"The Cat's Cradle\\" found on TypePad blog ends with the following quote:<br /><br />\\"I have a feeling God's question to me isn't going to be 'Did you believe in the cross?' but rather 'What did you do for your brothers and sisters?'\\"<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />To that I post the following reply, which I think may clarify and bring light to the terse comments which I made. I beg that you read them as--not the imperfect, hastily but thoughtfully written words--the truth behind them will quite possibly be the most important thing that you ever hear. Please ponder this message:<br /><br />I am the Jacob Hantla whom you reference in this post. I can see how the excerpt that you took from my review--and even the terseness of my review in general--could lead to the errant conclusion that you made of my position. For that, I apologize.<br /><br />Let me expound on how a true and Spirit-led focus on Christ and what he did at the cross (Give His own life to those who certainly were undeserving of it in order that we may know a God we have rejected, enjoy him forever, and with renewed hearts be gracious with everybody with whom we come into contact) will lead a Christian to even greater \\"social justice\\" than would otherwise be possible. The weight of grace, a grace that has forgiven a debt that could not be repaid in 10,000 lifetimes (see Matthew 18:23-35), must sit heavy upon one who truly believes. This is the mark of faith that James is looking for. A mark of a true Christian, one with true faith, is when belief in the enormous, infinite debt to sin which we have been forgiven compels that individual to not deal with others as they deserve.<br /><br />A true Christian looks out on the social injustice and sees it as, in fact, social justice. It is certain that any suffering that we or any other person experiences is far less than we deserve for our wholesale rejection of God and what He made us for, and any joy which we have is far more than we deserve. We have asked, as the human race and each man or woman individually in his or her heart, to be without God. If he gives us what we ask for, what we deserve, our torment will be far worse than the worst \\"injustice seen\\". This must make us look at the grace that we have received, both common grace to have possessions here on the earth and for the Christian, much more the grace of which I wrote earlier. That was all accomplished at the cross. A correct view of the cross will shove in our faces the grace which we have received at the expense of the Son of God and will eliminate any pretense for selfishness. Therefore, I as a sinner saved by grace can never look at anybody and deem them unworthy of my help, nor can I look at myself and my blessings and deem myself worthy to have them. I must give them away; like the unforgiving servant in the parable I referenced in Matthew 18:23-35, that would reveal an utter lack of faith.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Christians who claim to have their faith in the cross have generally (not all, but some and I think those are the ones whom you are referencing in this post) not lived out this ideal. Indeed, I have often been guilty of not living out this ideal. However, the solution will not be to abandon the cross, the only hope which we have for our present and our future, the only means by which we can truly live out \\"good works\\" in this world to the glory of God (Ephesians 2:10). The solution is to preach the message of the cross to ourselves each and every day. I would encourage you to read \\"The Cross-Centered Life by C.J. Mahaney.\\" In that very small, very helpful book you will see what I am talking about.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this. I pray that you will take the time to consider the grace which is being offered you now if you put your hope in Christ. All the good works that you could ever do will not be able to undo your sin. It doesn't have to. Christ died, so that God could be just and righteous by judging sin and at the same time be gracious by extending undeserved forgiveness to you and me. This is the most important news that you could ever hear; this is the Good News, the Gospel.ed at the cross. A correct view of the cross will shove in our faces the grace which we have received at the expense of the Son of God and will eliminate any pretense for selfishness. Therefore, I as a sinner saved by grace can never look at anybody and deem them unworthy of my help, nor can I look at myself and my blessings and deem myself worthy to have them.

Attention: Nursing School Faculty, please read<br /><br />As a student I am not in a position to compare Jarvis' book to any others like it so I am not going to pretend that I can. I will say that the easy writing and abundance of pictures makes this book a book we love to study. It is easy to understand and seems to balance simplicity with detail, not being overly in-depth on background issues, yet giving just enough information to help us understand both the theory and practice of physical examination and health assessment.<br /><br />BUT HERE'S THE RUB...<br /><br />After two months of use the book is falling apart. Entire sections have detached from the bindings, other random pages slip out singly from their location. Our use of the book has involved only reading it. There has not been any abuse, in fact the cover looks almost new. There isn't even any bending of the corners which would point to excessive use. Other students in the nursing program at ASU have been having similar issues.<br /><br />Why can a book like this that costs over seventy dollars be made in such a cheap manner? Nobody holds them accountable. I plan on keeping my textbooks long after school, using them as references throughout my career, but this one isn't even surviving a semester! Students can't hold the publisher accountable because we do not have the power of choice. We have to buy the books that our professors choose to use. It must be the instructors who step up and force publishers to do better.<br /><br />I have contacted the publisher regarding the issue. I will post a follow-up to this review as they either take responsibility or do not for their slipshod product.	2004-10-20

I was looking for a version of the ESV that was extremely compact, which I could drop in my pocket and not even feel it was there. My Gideon's New Testament (New King James Version) had previously fit this description well, except for my reading I prefer the ESV for many reasons which are beyond the scope of this review.<br /><br />Crossway has released a compact thinline bonded leather, which I was about to order, but when a girl in my small group showed me hers I decided that it was a great little package but still a little too thick and too bulky (containing the whole old testament...which makes me still want to buy it and maybe put up with the inconvenience for the privilege of having the entire scriptures available to me in my pocket). Then I got an email a couple of weeks later from discerning reader, saying that the trade paperbook ESV was for sale for two bucks. I jumped on it and bought two, one for me and one for my wife.<br /><br />It has now become my daily companion to classes, to work, and pretty much anywhere else I go. My only complaint is that it does not include Psalms like so many other New Testaments do. I appreciate that in such a small package Crossway did not skimp and provided red letters for the words of Jesus.<br /><br />As a final note, apparently Crossway is getting better with their binding. After two months of extreme use, the binding is holding up fine with no apparent signs of wear.<br /><br />My advice, for such a little cost, go ahead and buy this one. Maybe add it to your wishlist or your cart for that day when your order only hits twenty-two bucks and you need that extra little bit to get you to free shipping. :-)<br /><br />In Christ,<br /><br /> -Jacob Hantla	2004-09-21

I had never really thought about it, but I guess--even though it is contrary to my longing and belief that God can be and is glorified through all of the Christian's life--that I had always just assumed that business wasn't good in and of itself. In fact like Grudem asserts of those who are like I was, we believe, \\"that from a moral perspective [profit, competition, money, and business are] 'neutral' at best.\\" I guess that when I was pursuing a degree in engineering, I thought that I could glorify God through it by sharing the gospel at the work place, earning enough money to free my wife up to be a stay-at-home mom, and being able to give more money to the church. But Grudem's view is so much balanced and biblical than these views, exposing my blindness that would have kept me from obeying 1 Corinthians 10:31, \\"So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do (including business), do all for the glory of God.\\" (On a side not to 1 Cor 10:31, read \\"How to Drink Orange Juice to the Glory of God,\\" chapter 5 of John Piper's book, \\"Pierced by the Word.\\")<br /><br />The topics in which Grudem covers in this book, with a chapter devoted to each one are:<br /><br />How God is glorified by...<br /><br />1. Ownership<br /><br />2. Productivity<br /><br />3. Employment<br /><br />4. Commercial Transactions<br /><br />5. Profit<br /><br />6. Money<br /><br />7. Inequality of Possessions<br /><br />8. Competition<br /><br />9. Borrowing and Lending<br /><br />and he then includes two chapters on<br /><br />10. Attitudes of Heart<br /><br />11. Effects on World Poverty.<br /><br />Grudem is not blind to the abuses of business, the ways in which we idolize money and success and become gracious losing sight of the fact that we are operating with God's stuff not ours. He regularly comments throughout the book on concerns to balance the view, but the real wealth of attitude-changing information comes from not-often-talked-about fact that business can in-and-of-itself be glorifying to God. We don't have to feel \\"vaguely guilty\\" about business but can use it to both glorify God while we're doing it and advance the Kingdom through it.<br /><br />My only complaint is the size of the book, and for that I wish I could give it four-and-a-half stars. The book is really small (83 pages of text) and oftentimes when it seems like he is just beginning to develop a thought or when a proposition could use a little more defense, he needs to move on to the next topic of discussion. However, he can be excused because he has let the reader know that he is working on a larger edition saying in the preface, \\"The Bible says much about these topics, and a thorough treatment deserves a much larger book than this, one that I am still in the process of writing.\\"<br /><br />In summary, if you are in business or are a student studying or considering studying business, read this book. It should have a profound and God-glorifying effect (if read as it is written and not taken as a license to idolize business or success and withhold God's grace from people) on your life, studies, and career.<br /><br />Soli deo gloria.siness but can use it to both glorify God while we're doing it and advance the Kingdom through it. <br /> <br />My only complaint is the size of the book, and for that I wish I could give it four-and-a-half stars.

Reading the other negative reviews below I'm beginning to question myself, \\"Am I wierd?\\" \\"Am I missing something?\\" \\"Maybe I'm just a nerd.\\" I have taken many physiology- and biology-related courses during my time as a bioengineering and nursing student and this book is not as bad as people are making it out to be.<br /><br />Granted, Pathophysiology is a very difficult subject. There is tons to learn and it cannot possibly be mastered 100% after taking one course using one textbook, so I would like to begin by saying that I'm amazed at how good of a job these authors did in 1181 pages of text. I found that compared with many of the other books I've read the style in this one was actually rather easy to understand, with paragraphs first giving the overall you-need-to-know-this information moving down into the more obscure facts and explanations. Many times difficult sentences would be broken down in detail in the following sentences rendering the complicated a little easier to understand (see \\"Analyse This\\" review by another reader below).<br /><br />The authors have decided to break up the topic by body systems:<br /><br />1. Neurologic<br /><br />2. Endocrine<br /><br />3. Hematologic<br /><br />4. Cardiovascular and Lymphatic<br /><br />5. Pulmonary<br /><br />6. Renal and Urologic<br /><br />7. Reproductive<br /><br />8. Digestive<br /><br />9. Musculoskeletal and Integumentary<br /><br />Then in each system they first do a very helpful review of how the systems work under normal circumstances--basically a review from your anatomy and physiology classes. Then it moves on to discuss the diseases of each system and the pathophysiology of each one. First the disorder is described. Then the causes, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and treatments of each is discussed.<br /><br />My one complaint is with the number of pictures in the book. There are many good quality pictures, but not enough. Many times the authors go to extreme lengths to describe a disease and I walked away without a clue of what it would look like, which really hindered the practicality of my understanding. Then I'd go online and look it up and upon viewing a single picture, my confusion would usually go away.<br /><br />A final suggestion which really, really helped me was the purchase of the Study Guide (ISBN: 0323028462).a disease and I walked away without a clue of what it would look like, which really hindered the practicality of my understanding.

This book isn't an academic treatise on the cross. It isn't meant to thoroughly dissect the doctrines of sanctification and justification and their relation to the cross. It wasn't intended to exegetically prove anything.<br /><br /> What is was designed to do was to RADICALLY CHANGE YOUR LIFE GETTING YOUR MIND FOCUSSED ON THE CROSS and what Christ accomplished there. I know that the book achieved its goal because it has had a profound effect on me. There are very few books which so vividly stand out in my mind as tools that God has used to mold me into the image of His Son.<br /><br /> So often as we progress in the Christian life, we think that we must &quot;move on&quot; to the &quot;deeper&quot; things of the faith. We begin to prioritize Bible study, then prayer, and maybe fasting. We begin to serve in the church, and we develop doctrinal bases for doing all this. Then maybe we begin to develop systematic theologies that define the way that we live encorporating everything from creationism to eschatology. Then finally as &quot;mature&quot; Christians having spent tons of time thinking about the difficult and mind-stretching things of faith, we wonder where all of our growth is. We aren't really much more useful than we were when we began, and we might long for the joy that was ours when we first repented and saw God's glory, grace, and grandeur. What CJ points out is that so often we so distracted by important, but not central, points of the faith. WE FORGET THE CROSS.<br /><br /> CJ Mahaney spends about 100 very small, very easy-to-read pages painting the picture (See Galatians 3:1) of Christ on the Cross and the consequences of that scene in the lives of God's elect. This book walks us through the completeness and finality of justification, onto the continuing work of sanctification, and on into how all of these should effect our everyday lives.<br /><br /> This book stands in my lives in the ranks of Desiring God (John Piper) and The Enemy Within (Kris Lundgaard) as one of the three books that have most impacted me (aside from the Bible). It isn't a book that is going to impress your friends by making them think that you're really smart, but through the Spirit's work in your heart, it will daily bring you to knees in repentence and to your feet in rejoicing.

By focusing on the separateness of the two individuals in unifying marriage, this book will only encourage the divisions that it seeks to stop. Claiming a form of biblicalness by referring to biblical passages but missing the biblical model of marriage, they write a book that will harm many a Christian marriage. Their thesis is that many of the post marital problems comes because Christian couples naively assume that when two become one they will truly be that: one. No, they say, they remain to be two and the only way to keep the troubles out are to define boundaries of each's individuality from the onset.<br /><br />You hear none of this in the Bible. Rather you read, 'What God has joined together let no man separate.' Marriage is designed by God to be a supernatural unifying to two individuals, much like in the trinity, indeed the best picture of this unity that the world can see. 'Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.' A selfless love by the husband will keep conflicts to a minimum because he leads, not by following his own desires, but by looking out for her best interest. 'Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.'<br /><br />Rather than saying that our conflicts are because we are rebelliously living outside of God's plan for marriage, 'Boundaries in Marriage' says that we just need to give each other their space. Some of the suggestions are wise and would help to make a more godly marriage, but not because we are honoring each others' individuality, but because they involved thinking of the other.<br /><br />If you are just newly married or have been married for a while and are looking for some practical advice on making your marriage a better agent for God's glory I would recommend:<br /><br />For wives - The Excellent Wife: A Biblical Perspective by Martha Peace<br /><br />For husbands - Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God by C.J. Mahaney<br /><br />For couples - Reforming Marriage by Douglas Wilson (although I do not agree with one-size-fits-all applications on areas such as homeschooling).<br />For wives - The Excellent Wife: A Biblical Perspective by Martha Peace <br />For husbands - Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God by C.J.

Mahaney has written one of the most useful books that I have ever read.<br /><br />This book is written for men. Men need to step up and lead in romancing the marriage. Therefore Mahaney asks that men don't read this book with their wives. Great intimacy, including sex is something that every marriage should be full of. If that is missing, it is primarily the husband's issue that he needs to fix. Then in chapter 2 he moves on to give the biblical God-given purpose for marriage from Ephesians 5: \\"A profound mystery, revealed to all to see.\\"<br /><br />My favorite chapters then follow (3-6) in which Mahaney lets the readers draw from his life experiences, his successes and his failures, to help us with romancing our wives, touching their hearts and minds so that then touching their bodies is so much more intimate, frequent, and amazing. These chapters have been so useful to me. I'm not going to ruin it for you by giving you any of the advice here. But let me tell you that just taking advantage of the advice that he gives and the motivation that comes knowing that greater intimacy better glorifies God has already had a very noticeable impact in the two weeks since I finished my first reading of the book...so much so that my wife has told me whatever I read has changed me for the better.<br /><br />Finally he ends in chapter 7 with a mild exposition of Song of Solomon 8:5-7, \\"Strong as Death, The Enduring Power of Covenant Love.\\" Marital love goes beyond just sex, but sex is truly only as amazing as God designed it to be in the context of marriage. Marital love is forever, it isn't dependent on sexual ability; it isn't dependent on perfection; it isn't dependent on emotions. Marital love comes for God and is a reflection of God's love for the church.<br /><br />Carolyn Mahaney, C.J.'s wife wrote the an appendix, \\"A Word to Wives\\" which I haven't read but have been told by my wife is very good. I too have noticed a difference in her since she has read that chapter and the book from which it comes \\"Feminine Appeal.\\"<br /><br />I strongly recommend you read this book.

Extremely Useful Resource	I think that the best way to describe the purpose of the book is to steal the first paragraph from the author's preface to the first edition: &quot;A former New Testament colleague was once asked by a student how he could learn to do exegesis, intending that his teacher should suggest a book. My colleague answered, 'You will just have to take a course.' That answer is the tacit admission of what all of us who teach NT know to be true: There simply is no book that serves either as a textbook or a guide for students to learn the exegetical process, from the opening of their Bibles to the writing of the paper. This book hopes to fill that lacuna.&quot;<br />This book's target audience is an academic one whose end to exegesis will be a paper (or an expository sermon), but as a layman I have found it to be extremely helpful, even indispensable, in my exegetical endeavors to better learn and therefore accurately apply the Word of God. Also, the book is written primarily for those who know Greek (I do not know enough to even be dangerous); however, in the new edition Fee has made the attempt to provide alternative exercises (such as compare many different versions and maybe use a textual commentary to try to determine as close as possible the original) for the English only student.<br />CHAPTER 1: Guide for Full Exegesis<br />Chapter 1 basically organized in outline form, providing first the &quot;initial steps for all genres,&quot; first naming the major exegetical step that must be performed and then providing more and more detailed information and guidance on each step. Then moving past the steps that are the same for all genres, Fee gives the steps necessary for various genres (i.e. Epistles, Gospels, Revelation, etc). Finally the chapter ends with a section on moving from interpretation to application.<br />CHAPTER 2: Exegesis and the Original Text<br />Also arranged in outline format with the following sections (1) Structural Analysis, (2) Establishing the Text, (3) Analysis of Grammer, (4) Analysis of Words, (5) Historical-Cultural Background, and (6) Analysis of Pericope. Just as in the other chapters, the outline works from very general headings and general paragraphs of information to very specific and technical subheadings.<br />CHAPTER 3: Short Guide for Sermon Exegesis<br />I find myself often in Chatper 3 as I study as Fee uses this chapter to show how good, solid exegesis will move into the most powerful, Word-filled sermons. If you teach from the Word (as a pastor, small group leader, youth group leader, whatever) I recommend this book and this chapter in addition to Rediscovering Expository Preaching by MacArthur et al (Also available in Spanish: El Redescubrimiento De La Predicaci&oacute;n Expositiva).<br />CHAPTER 4: AIDS &amp; RESOURCES FOR THE STEPS IN EXEGESIS<br />Fees ends in referring the student to othe very useful resources organized by type.<br />I would be amiss if I did not address the one downside to this book which I believe is the temptation to &quot;do the steps&quot; and skip the prayer, the heartsearching, the repentance, the awe, the worship. An unregenerate person can &quot;do the steps&quot; and if done responsibly come up with an exegetical position, maybe even a correct one. We cannot know God through human wisdom (1 Cor 1:21). Fee mentions this temptation, but it is by no means the focus of the book, nor should it be. The temptation to be purely academic in Bible study is a great one, and a &quot;how to&quot; book on the subject could propagate this error in some. However the book should not be condemned simply because the method of presentation (which is a highly effective one) could be taken by the cold hearts of some to their folly. Rather, understand the evil of your own heart which is always beside you (Romans 7:21), crucify your flesh, repent where necessary, and seek the truth of God which is found in the Bible with a disciplined, passionate fervor. It is in this final endeavor that &quot;New Testament Exegesis&quot; is invaluable.<br />Finally, if you use Libronix Digital Library System, I would STRONGLY recommend you go ahead and buy this along with Stuart's Old Testament Exegesis book for Logos. If not you will find yourself with a dog-eared and bookmarked book as you flip back and forth as Fee makes extensive use of referencing other portions of his text.ent Exegesis&quot; is invaluable.<br />Finally, if you use Libronix Digital Library System, I would STRONGLY recommend you go ahead and buy this along with Stuart's Old Testament Exegesis book for Logos.

If you teach from the Word (as a pastor, small group leader, youth group leader, whatever) I recommend this book and this chapter in addition to Rediscovering Expository Preaching by MacArthur et al.<br />CHAPTER 4: AIDS &amp; RESOURCES FOR THE STEPS IN EXEGESIS<br />Fees ends in referring the student to othe very useful resources organized by type.<br />I would be amiss if I did not address the one downside to this book which I believe is the temptation to &quot;do the steps&quot; and skip the prayer, the heartsearching, the repentance, the awe, the worship. An unregenerate person can &quot;do the steps&quot; and if done responsibly come up with an exegetical position, maybe even a correct one. We cannot know God through human wisdom (1 Cor 1:21). Fee mentions this temptation, but it is by no means the focus of the book, nor should it be. The temptation to be purely academic in Bible study is a great one, and a &quot;how to&quot; book on the subject could propagate this error in some. However the book should not be condemned simply because the method of presentation (which is a highly effective one) could be taken by the cold hearts of some to their folly. Rather, understand the evil of your own heart which is always beside you (Romans 7:21), crucify your flesh, repent where necessary, and seek the truth of God which is found in the Bible with a disciplined, passionate fervor. It is in this final endeavor that &quot;New Testament Exegesis&quot; is invaluable.<br />Finally, if you use Libronix Digital Library System, I would STRONGLY recommend you go ahead and buy this along with Stuart's Old Testament Exegesis book for Logos. If not you will find yourself with a dog-eared and bookmarked book as you flip back and forth as Fee makes extensive use of referencing other portions of his text.ital Library System, I would STRONGLY recommend you go ahead and buy this along with Stuart's Old Testament Exegesis book for Logos.

Unfortunately only 17 pages of that attempts to make a Biblical case for the supper and the way in which he asserts it should be practiced. There are four chapters with an introduction and an epilogue:<br />1. Biblical Foundations of the Supper<br />2. The Lord's Supper in Church History<br />3. The Lord's Supper in Reformed Theolgoy<br />4. The Lord's Supper in Practice<br />Beginning with the proposition that the Lord's Supper is not a modified Passover meal at all but is instead looking back to Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and Israel's elders on Mount Sinai in Exodus 24:1-1, Letham sets out to describe what does and does not happen at the Lord's supper. Both Biblically and traditionally (citing much from classic treatises, catechisms, and confessionals) Letham disputes Rome's view of Christ's physical presence through transubstantiation and Luther's view of the same through consubstantiation. He argues for a very real spiritual presence and communion taking place through Lord's Supper, making communion much more than the simple &quot;remembrance&quot; of most evangelicals.<br />It is after this point (after the second chapter) that the Bible begins to play a very minimal role in the work. Chapter three's goal is to expound the views of the Lord's Supper as taken by (1) Calvin and (2) The Westminster Standards.<br />Then Chapter four tells how the Eucharist has traditionally been taken: administered often by an ordained minister from a single loaf and a single cup, using wine and any kind of bread, and administered to confessing, baptized believers.<br />Unfortunately, I feel that the conclusions of this book come far to heavily from traditional views, seeming in many instance to set tradition almost on par with scripture (I am not at all implying that this was Letham's intent). Much of my mild disappointment with this book came from misplaced expectations. I was expecting a thoroughly Biblical exposition of the Lord's supper in doctrine and in practice. The purpose of this book seems to be, rather, a call for Presbyterians to return to their traditional roots, especially in regard to the sacrament of the Eucharist. Understanding this, I would recommend this book as a useful tool to simply and tersely summarize a biblical and the traditional reformed view of the Lord's Supper.tations.

Nevertheless, I felt the need to throw some more money at the process and went to Amazon and ordered the Guide to Passing the Experior Real Estate Exam. I looked through it a few times but found that the questions were remarkably exactly like the ones my school gave me to review. After taking the test I realized that buying this book probably contributed nothing to my passing of the exam.<br />I do not say all of this to say that the book is useless; it is far from it. However, I want to dispell the myth that you need to go out and purchase extra materials to pass the exam. I have since loaned my book to several licensees-to-be within our company and the book was much more help to them. This was primarily because I took the Experior exam immediately after classes, so the information in the book was something that I had immediate and more familiar access to within my study materials from school. However for the those who borrowed the book and proceeded to pass the exam, the book was helpful because quite some time had passed between their schooling and taking the exam.<br />The Guide to Passing the Experior Real Estate Exam is strong in that it has many questions to review and practice with AND it takes the time to explain the answers to the questions. Many of the answers are regretably short and not thorough, but many are very insightful into the questions that students have.<br />The faults of this book are not inherent to the book. The book accomplishes what it sets out to do very well. But the faults of the book are related to its relevance and necessity. Do not neglect the use of the materials provided to you at school thinking that the more money you throw at your real estate education the better you will do. It's generally not true. But if you are rusty on your knowledge and getting ready to take the exam or your school does not provide adequate study helps this book is a great option.xam or your school does not provide adequate study helps this book is a great option.	2004-05-28

Many times we legalistically to battle these sins one at a time, not seeing the big picture of what's going on, that when our lives are dominated by sin, we have not been guarding our hearts. Proverbs 4:23 says, &quot;Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.&quot; This book does what many others don't, it points you to your wicked and easily moldable heart as the source of your actions, both good and bad.<br />Unfortunately, in my opinion, the book did not deal deeply enough or thoroughly enough with the nature of sin and the importance of repentance. We have to understand that the enemy is not only outside of us, but primarily within. It is our flesh (see Romans 7:14-25). Although Rosberg would not say this, an easy conclusion to come to after reading his book is that if you keep the bad out (by removing yourself from bad influences) you are completely guarding your heart. This is only partly true. He doesn't deal with the enemy within though, that no matter how much wordly bad you run away from, you will still have to guard your heart from your flesh. The enemy isn't just the world, the enemy is your sinful nature which unless daily crucified will bring you running headlong into sin. This may be considered a minor point and Rosberg does mention it in passing in different areas. However, I felt that because of this oversight, this would not be my number one read or number one recommendation on the issue. It is a useful one, don't get me wrong, but because of the above-mentioned issue I don't feel that it is the best.<br />In conclusion there are two books on the issue that I would strongly recommend to be read before Guard Your Heart. Reading time is limited and it is important that discretion be taken in what to read. If after considering my recommendations you still decide to go ahead and read Guard Your Heart, you will not be led astray, but please consider my advise and try to come by the following three books and read them thoughtfully:<br />(1) The Enemy Within by Kris Lundgaard (ISBN: 0875522017)<br />(2) Not Even a Hint by Joshua Harris (ISBN: 1590521471)<br />(3) The Cross Centered Life by C.J.

Dealing in 13 chapters with different aspects and scenes from those hours, the divinity of Christ and His humanness are both kept sharply in focus. The sin of mankind both for which Christ was dying and the sins of those who directly took part in His murder are not deminished, but neither is the fact that &quot;It was the will of the Lord to crush him&quot; that it was the Lord who &quot;has put him to grief&quot; (Isaiah 53:10).<br />I recommend that you read this book in a quiet place with little destraction with your Bible by your side. Read it one chapter at a time and then sit and re-read, and pray. Let the Spirit take you back to the foot of the cross where you gaze up at your only hope, the King of the universe hanging in misery, damnation, and ultimately victory. Look at the cross he bore and realize that with such a high price to secure our salvation, anything that we hope to add or to repay will only be an insult to His gift, diminishing its value and His glory. Let the Spirit take you to the foot of the cross where you realize who we are, we are all beggars.	2004-05-27

I have a copy of the book and thought that it may be beneficial for people to read the back cover text since Amazon did not supply it here:<br />Let's Quit Fighting about the Holy Spirit is a call to unity and understanding of the most controversial spiritual spiritual issue facing Christian churches today. Against the background of the author's personal struggle, this book delineates clearly and in a gentle manner why misunderstandings concerning the gifts of the Holy Spirit exist and how they can be cleared away by love and truth.<br />Let's Quit Fighting About the Holy Spirit shows how sectarian attitues of &quot;we got it and you don't&quot; get started; what exciting things God is doing with His people at this hour; and how these happenings relate to the concepts of love and oneness among believers, something for which we all yearn. Pete Gillquist does this with a kind and compassionate spirit arising out of his deep love for Christians on both sides of the issue.	2004-05-24

Walter Kaiser, does an excellent and very convincing job of tying the Old Testament together by showing the consistent, conscious, and continual theology of God's promise throughout the entire Old Testament. When I began reading this book I was skeptical, thinking that Kaiser was going to force the Old Testament into a convenient boxed way of thinking. I was actually hesitant to even read it, not being that interested in its contents. Now I am convinced that the authors of the various Old Testament books consciously understood the progressive revelation and fulfillment of God's promise of which they wrote.<br />I have to say, the first 70 pages will turn off many. In these pages Kaiser sets out to explain the history behind Old Testament theologies and why he believes many fall short and in which ways. Then he sets out to define how his theology of the Old Testament developed and what hermeneutic he uses (a defining difference between Kaiser and many others is his focus on authorial intent and the message's intent within the context it was written). He ends the first part with a summary of the continuity of the blessing of promise throughout the Old Testament. These pages are very heavy reading. You will probably find yourself dozing. If you are really having a hard time with this section, my recommendation: Read chapter 4 of Part 1 and then move on the bulk of the book, Part II (you can always go read part 1 later). I do not think that Part I is superfluous but it is not necessary to understand and appreciate the message of the book.<br />Part II defines the Old Testametn theology in almost 200 pages. The Chapters are as follows:<br />5. Prolegomena to the Promise: Prepatriarchal Era<br />6. Provisions in the Promise: Patriarchal Era<br />7. People of the Promise: Mosaic Era<br />8. Place of the Promise: Premonarchical Era<br />9. King of the Promise: Davidic Era<br />10. Life in the Promise: Sapiential Era<br />11. Day of the Promse: 9th Century<br />12. Servant of the Promise: 8th Century<br />13. Renewal of the Promise: 7th Century<br />14. Kingdom of the Promise: Exilic Prophets<br />15. Triumph of the Promise: Postexilic Prophets<br />Finally the 3rd chapter is an 8-page summary of this Theology's connection with New Testament Theology. I do wish that this section had been more through, but the message was there.<br />The very thorough indices (by authors, subjects, Scripture referecnes, and Hebrew words) are very helpful to help you use this as a reference after reading it.<br />A book that I was not too excited about reading has now become on of the most used and dog-eared in my library.

That makes it both a light and easy read, but it also leaves you wondering (like many of the other reviewers) &quot;How much of this is true?&quot;. I understand the concern of the many reviewers claiming that the numbers don't &quot;add up.&quot; To that, I just have to say, &quot;I don't really care.&quot; This book isn't primarily a documentary. It is just a really entertaining and addicting read. The goal is not to teach you how to beat the system; it isn't to document how they beat the system. Like the title says, the book is primarily a story about the &quot;Six M.I.T. Students.&quot;<br />Like I said in the title, this book is entertaining, but it is not something that you're going to want to keep in your library. This will ultimately wind up at garage sales galore in about a year, so save yourself the money and go to the library and check it out or wait for all of the $0.01 Amazon Marketplace specials that will inevitably appear come about Christmas time.<br />I hope this review gives you the incentive to read this book, but also does not give you the exagerated expectations of so many other reviews (including the cover reviews) that have been circulating.

Based on some negative comments that I have made on the writings of John Shelby Spong in the past, I have received a few emails both lambasting and congratulating me on my thoughts. Already getting a glimpse of it in Here I Stand, I decided to read his Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalists. The I just wanted to warn my readers about what is out there, being passed off as mainstream Christian thought, and is being eaten up.<br /><br />Chapter 14 is a great example of what Spong stands for, and I cannot for the life of me understand how this logic appeals to, much less makes any ounce of sense to anybody. I'll quote from p. 227, where Spong rips a question of Bonhoeffer's from its context and makes one of the most blunt relativistic statements I've seen. And the fact that he is thought of as a great thinker is beyond me: \\"[Bonhoeffer's] question was not 'Who is Christ?' but rather, 'Who is Christ for us, for our day?' Bonhoeffer recognized, as so many religious people fail to do, that anything we say about Christ is subjective. We do not capture Christ...Our words point to Christ. Our images interact with Christ. But our words and our images are products of our world, of our cultural realities. They are not objective. They will not endure forever.\\"<br /><br />I think many think that he is brilliant because they cannot follow his flow of thought. Let's break this down: \\"We should not seek to find out who Christ really is. That is a mistake because our perception will be subjective. And because our perception is subjective (not objective) therefore it is wrong to seek an objective reality of who Christ is.\\" First off, there is an implicit assumption here which Spong will not make explicit--he even explicitly denies this assumption--that the existance, the attributes, the actions, and the power of Christ must be objective. IF we are to view anything subjectively, there must be something to view. My perception of Christ may not be perfectly accurate, just as your perception may not be either, but that does not change the fact that an objective reality exists.<br /><br />Take the following example: I am walking down the street with my iPod in my ears and I see a man fall down dead in front of me. I did not hear anything because the only reality that I could hear was the music blaring in my ears. I did not see a cause for the man's death, so I assumed that he must have had a heart attack. Another person heard a gunshot and saw a group of teenagers running down the street. That individual's perception is that he was shot by teens. A third person saw a sniper take aim and pull the trigger. That person's assumption is that the sniper shot the man. Three perceptions. Maybe one of them is correct. Maybe none of them are. But it does not eliminate the fact of an objective reality. And we don't live in this world like Spong suggests. No, we conduct an investigation to try to bring our subjective reality as close to in-line with objective reality as possible. Granted, our perception limits us, but the quest should not be ignored.<br /><br />That is why I do not ask first and foremost, \\"who is Christ to me?\\" I want to take the evidence presented in God's word and in the testimony of the lives of the witnesses to his life, death, and resurrection and say \\"Who is Christ?\\" I want to read his own testimony of himself. Then, trying to mold my view of him as close to that truth as possible, then and only then do I ask the question \\"Who is Christ to me?\\" And the answer then becomes, \\"My only Hope. He's my Savior. He's my Treasure. He's my King!\\"<br /><br />On my own, I could turn Christ into whoever I want. Given free territory in which to roam, unchecked by the truth of Scripture, my imagination can and does redefine God constantly. Therefore, I must believe the Word when it says of God, \\"You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them;and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you. (Neh 9:6)\\" Because if I don't I tend to think that my perception defines reality. \\"My thought creates truth,\\" I tell myself. What utter lies. God alone is Lord.<br /><br />But that isn't a message that my sinful heart likes to hear and it isn't a message that Spong wants to hear. Therefore he has written the book, \\"Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism\\" and told us that the Bible isn't God's word, objective truth is a foolish aim, God is whoever we make him, and the ultimate goal and aim of our life and religion is good works and our contentment. Please take your eyes off yourself and turn them to Christ. He has existed for eternity as God, humbled himself and became a man for our sake, died the death we deserve on the Cross, and now he is interceding at the right hand of the Father on our behalf. How do I know that? The Bible tells me so. So please don't listen to these lies and pick up your Bible and read it. Start with Matthew and read straight through to Revelation and then start from Genesis and do the whole thing over again. Don't take my word for it, don't let Spong's attempt to Rescue the Bible ruin it, but read it and let God do the rest as he changes your heart and saves you from your sins.<br /><br />In a postmodern era, where truth is relative and reality undefinable, this book provides quick and easy pain relief, kind of like taking morphine for cancer. For the most part, we all want to believe that there is a God or at least something out there; that way we don't feel like this life is such a waste.

After just finishing a one-year study of James, using 5 different commentaries extensively, I found that Richardson's commentary was very useful expositional commentary. There are some sections which are really good, really enlightening, and relatively thorough (although his goal in this commentary was not to deal thoroughly with every nuance of the text). However, other sections, for no identifiable purpose, he simply fails to comment. I found this extremely frustrating, but I could work through it. His introduction to the book and his exposition of the middle of chapter 1 (enticement by his own desires) was particularly helpful and well written.<br />Nevertheless, because of the inconsistency of his commentary (spending tons of time on one portion of a verse and literally ignoring another) makes this one of my least favorite of my acceptable James commentaries. In my opinion, you may want to look into Moo's (0802800793), Kistemaker's (0801020808), and/or MacArthur's (0802409008) Commentaries.	2004-04-28

You would do well to buy either one of these. This one is shorter and easier to digest, but the Pillar commentary is a little longer and more thorough, particularly on passages which are often topics of debate (2:14-26 especially).<br />Moo works very hard to be exegetical. He hesitates--no, he refrains--from saying anything that he cannot demonstrate exegetically from the text. He humbly alerts the reader when his view is in the minority or contested and even humbly admits when his view is not the only defendable one (see, specifically James 4:5). To a degree matched by few, Moo not only seeks to technically (without belaboring issues so as to make them inaccessibly technical) defend his points exposing salient points of interest in the text, but he also is a carefully writes his sentences, not wasting words.<br />The student of the Letter of James would be amiss not to invest in the Pillar Commentary by Moo. For those who would like it a little shorter and a little easier to digest, this Tyndale Commentary on James will suffice as well.

This commentary is among my favorite three for James because of its good exegesis, accessibility, and lucidity of writing.

He tends to take each section as an independent piece, drawing from others in his explanations of them, but he fails to reveal the connectedness fo the various sections as Moo and others do. This is a rather serious downfall of many commentaries on James. A thorough defensible and effectual view of James comes from an understanding of the flow of thought among the sections. When this is not understood, the book can tend to become a &quot;to-do&quot; list with tons of application, but the motivation can be lost.

Many times you will leave Stulac's explanation of a passage wanting some detail on his decision. Obviously, Stulac's intention in such a short, expository commentary was not to beat every detail, but Moo (in the later IVP New Testament Commentary Series) in his commentary on James has managed to do it. If you already have Stulac, you have a good commentary, but you may need to invest in another more detailed one (Kistemaker or Lenski) to understand a lot of the issues that he glosses over or doesn't touch.<br />However, if you are contemplating making a purchase of an accessible, easy-to-read expository commentary on James, I would recommend Moo, with MacArthur and Kistemaker coming in a close 3rd and 2nd.	2004-04-28

Oftentimes, they quote directly from official denominational literature. I also appreciate the appendices which refer the researcher to further information on a particular denomination.<br />The large denominational categories covered, with many subcategories each are:<br />1.

But you can find all of those words in the new one, just not listed separately. However, if you're like me and want to use all the new-fangled words like zit then you won't find them in any edition but the new one. I'm sure that there are many other new words in this edition, zit is just the only one that I've noticed so far.

This book, using his own life and his influential father as well as the lives of the Eisenhower boys, the Custer boys, Crazy Horse and He Dog, Eisenhower and Patton, and Nixon, poignantly and emotionally demonstrates the immense joy, satisfaction, and power that is to be had in the relationships that can only be shared between father and son and between two best friends. Reading Ambrose's heartfelt musings, I was often reminded of my own relationship with my father. I bought him one and he had the same reaction, thinking of both his father and me.<br />Having read the majority of Ambrose's works from which he pulled the short chapters for Comrades, I was perhaps even that much more moved by the essays.

I went on Amazon and purchased a copy. Tragically, I let it sit on my shelf for almost six months without reading it. About a year ago, I picked it up and read it, expecting it to be a labor-intensive read. It was not. Instead, in very simple terms and using simple yet convincing examples, Pollack managed to challenge everything I ever learned in school in two days (It only took two days because I found myself reading this book every chance I got; I coult not put it down).<br />Challenging even many of the basic tenets of cellular biology-- from even the existance of selective ion channels in the fluid mosaic model of the cell wall to blowing the lid off of what every student is taught in school about the way muscle cells contract--Pollack writes a book that has been and will continue to be challenging, because it challenges the premises of the life-long work of many scientists. <br />While I'm sure that some of his critiques of the beliefs of the faith of cellular biology today will prove to be wrong, Pollack is not afraid of the challenge or the community backlash against him. I applaud the work. I recommend it as required reading for just about everybody: the writing style makes it accessible for even high school students, but it is not too plebian to challenge even a professor or researcher in the area. <BR>  -Jacob	2004-03-16

This book is just fun to read. I got this book on Amazon.com at the clearance sale...you can get it almost free if you get it used. At those prices this book may be one of the best bargains around. What better way to hear the story of the 1900's than from those who lived through all of it! In six chapters (The Good Old Days, Labor Days, The Great War, Brave New World, The Gold Years, &amp; In Winter's Light) the major periods of the century are brought to light using short, entertaining, yet extremely insightful anecdotes from the various centenarians interviewed. None of them were famous (at least I'd never heard of them). None of them had lived exceptional lives. Therefore, every story is new, yet remarkably familiar. I strongly recommend this book to any buyer. This is history for nonhistorians and historians alike, America's story told for the common American by common Americans.	2004-03-16

The book focuses far too much on the movie and not enough on what the Bible has to say about the Passion. From a Catholic perspective the book probably succeeds.

Their Gospel is definately different than that declared by Jesus, Paul, Peter, James, and other in the New Testament. The Gospel of the New Testament has the power to save. Jesus came to earth to die in the place sinful humanity so that whoever would put his only hope of being made right before God (justification) can have eternal life through Christ taking our punishment on himself. Paul has something to say about this sort of thing in his letter to the Galatians: \\"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting &#65279;him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to &#65279;a different gospel-not that there is another one, but &#65279;there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.

One cannot walk away from this book claiming indifference to Him. Too many people aimles run straight to Hell, avoiding the gracious offer of grace, by simply not thinking about it. Jesus came to earth claiming to be God. He and His apostles claimed that he died in order to take God's wrath stored up for us all. He claimed that if anybody would give up all hope except hope in His death for salvation from our sins, they would be saved and if He was rejected, they would be left to face God's justice in an eternity in Hell. You have to embrace Him and His claims or reject them. Indifference and moral living does not count for anything. For a Christian read this book. It may be possible that you have been worshipping an idol, ignorant of who Jesus really is, or perhaps your faith will be strengthened. If you're not a Christian, read this book to understand what you are rejecting, then I pray that you would turn to Him for salvation.	2004-03-13

Christians and Conservative tend to be synonyms in society today. This is often for very good reason, but sometimes Christians get their faith mixed up with the conservatism and end up being reactionaries to liberalism and paganism. They ignore the Gospel--the Good News that Jesus, God, came to earth to take the punishment that mankind deserves for our sin so that eternal life with Him can be offered to those whose only hope is His death--for the sake of conservatism. Unfortunately, the message of Credo is the opposite reaction. Seeing the social justice and aid to the helpless (See James 1:27), the left-leaning wing of Christianity tends to embrace social activism and morality at the expense of what is truly eternally helpful, the Cross of Jesus Christ. So for Christians the message of the religious right and the religious left must be tempered with the Gospel. If you choose to read this book, do not forget what the Christian message really is.	2004-03-13

This perspective is juxtaposed beside the tale of the military and police forces from the United States and Colombia seeking to put an end to his ruthless reign of terror.<br />The author has done his research and it shows. You get the distinct impression from Bowden's writing that the author knows much more than he is actually saying in his account. Therefore, he is able to weave a story, rich with facts,and easily able to captivate the reader's attention at every turn. This is what I believe sets Bowden, Ambrose, and others apart among popular historians: They do their homework. They don't do their research, it seems, with the intent of getting just enough for their book. They research every angle of the book and then from that massive block of knowledge they sculpt a story that is both accurate and spellbinding.<br />I came to this book with little or no prior knowledge of Pablo Escobar and the US involvement in the Colombian drug cartels, so I am unable to review this book from that perspective. You will have to rely on better-versed reviewers for that. However, from a consumer standpoint--somebody who loves a good story, especially if it is true--this book outperformed my expectations. I finished reading it in three nights; I could not put it down. Buyer beware, do not start reading this, unless you want to finish it quickly.

Jesus Christ has become a commonplace name to be heard in the office, in the classroom, on TV, and in the paper. 1 Corinthians 1:18 says, &quot;...the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.&quot; Therefore, you would expect two possible reactions to the movie: (1) Confusion and anger or (2) A response to the power of the message of the cross. That is exactly what we see, and that is exactly why this book was written.<br />Because the movie presents the cross completely uncontextualized, those unfamiliar with the Bible will fall prey to the message of the popular culture and the media that would seek to immasculate the gospel. They say that Jesus was a political activist who was willing to die for what he believed. He was a misunderstood good teacher who was unfairly murdered. He is an antisemitic invention of some misguided religious folk. Or maybe they've just fallen prey to the temptation to think that this is just a &quot;Christian movie&quot; that doesn't relate to them. In other words, the message of the cross is foolishness to them. If this describes you or anybody that you know, this book is definately for you (or them).<br />The Passion of Jesus Christ gives 50 reasons WHY Christ came to die. These reasons contextualize the movie. The physical suffering of Christ was not unique. Thousands, if not more, throughout history have died equally as painful deaths physically. However, the real suffering of the Christ that could never be captured on film was the rending of the perfect union between the Father and Son as the righteous wrath of the Father against all of humanity for our sins was placed squarely on Christ: Infinite wrath from an infinitely righteous and powerful God placed on the infinitely perfect Son in a finite amount of time to redeem us for all eternity. Jesus cried out in infinite anguish before he died, giving us a glimpse into the purpose of the cross and the real suffering there, &quot;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&quot; (Matthew 27:46) The book is for the skeptic, the nonbeliever, the confused. Thoughtfully, gently, and in easy-to-read, two-page chapters, Piper shares 50 reasons why Jesus came to die.<br />For the believer who has already embraced Christ as his/her only hope for salvation, the movie was 2 hours of guided, love-evoking meditation on the cross. As I watched the punishment of my Savior, Isaiah 53:5 was etched into my mind, bringing tears of gratitude and love streaming down my cheeks. He who knew no sin was made to be sin on my behalf (2 Corinthians 5:21). This book is earnestly needed by an unbelieving world, but equally as much for believers. The reasons why He died drive us to our knees in adoration, humiliation, and gratitude; they move us to graciousness, patience, and love; and they don't let us forget that our righteousness and hope is in Christ alone. As I watched the mocking crowds, anti-semitism was not aroused, but instead Horatio Bonar's poem echoed in my ears:<br />`Twas I that shed the sacred blood;<br />I nailed him to the tree;<br />I crucified the Christ of God;<br />I joined the mockery.<br />Of all that shouting multitude<br />I feel that I am one;<br />And in that din of voices rude<br />I recognize my own.<br />Around the cross the throng I see,<br />Mocking the Sufferer's groan;<br />Yet still my voice it seems to be,<br />As if I mocked alone<br />So, for believers and non-believers alike, this book is highly recommended. It is easy to read. It's presentation of Scripture to enlighten our view of Christ and His death is thought-provoking. You will not be able to finish this book and passively look at the cross. Presented with God's own word on His own death, you will either understand the &quot;why&quot; of the Passion of the Christ. You will either embrace Christ or reject him. Indifference is not an option.<br />Soli Deo GloriaDeo Gloria	2004-03-12

Using Huether and McCance's 3rd edition of Understanding Pathophysiology in my recent Pathophys class, this workbook and study guide was an invaluable resource. The textbook is relatively complete and thorough in its information. Oftentimes I found myself getting lost, missing the forest for the sake of the trees. I could not see the bigger picture of some of the processes that we were studying. I also found that to review and refresh the information that I had read in the book, the &quot;Quick Checks&quot; and the &quot;Did You Understand&quot; sections were not sufficient.<br />That was where the study guide and workbook came in. It only presents the &quot;must know&quot; information. Oftentimes describing the process in a summary manner, instead of the step-by-step pathways described in the textbook, helped me see what was really going on. Then learning the individual steps of the various cascades and processes no longer seemed like an excercise in memorization, but rather a reinforcing of my understanding. The study guide and workbook uses concise summaries, tables, flowcharts, and practice exams to instill the most important of the information to the reader. The indepth info in the textbook is important, but it is not what is generally tested over. Tests, at least in my class, tend to be over the most important information. This is exactly what this textbook offers, the most important information. I believe that my A in pathophys is owed in large part to this study guide and workbook. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody using the corresponding textbook.	2004-03-10

I don't think pathophysiology could ever be incredibly easy, and if it could be this book falls short of the mark. But for the sake of this review, I'm going to lower the mark. Pathophysiology will always require hard work to master, but oftentimes mastery is hindered by the presentation of information. It is in the presentation of pertinent information that Pathophysiology Made Incredibly Easy! excels.<br />  The book contains 13 chapters. Each one focuses on a body system and the disorders affecting that system with additional chapters affecting systemic problems and issues like genetics, immunological disorders, infections, and cancer. The book cannot be and is not exhaustive, but that is not its purpose. The book covers the most often seen and most often discussed diseases. Each, for the most part, is presented in an easy-to-digest manner. Rather than use paragraphs, bullet points, summary graphics, and short sentences highlight the pertinent information. Finally the disease sections end with summaries of the test results that would indicate a particluar malady along with the current common treatments of that disease. There are also many case studies provided to reinforce learning in a practical way.<br />  On the downside, I felt that the some of the cartoons were distracting and irreverent, especially in the context of some of the diseases being discussed. I understand the desire to make learning the diseases fun, but personally I think that irreverence to disease and the diseased may tend to make for unsympathetic care givers. Nevertheless, the book is useful for students of pathophysiology, especially those being exposed to the field for the first time.	2004-03-10

I thoroughly enjoyed most of it. He presents a very technical, a possibly boring subject in a very realistic and easy-to-read light. Many cyber-crime books either blow the topic way out of proportion and pander to the uneducated and gullible. They would have the same sort of audience that stocked up on supplies in the waning days of 1999 waiting for the Y2K bug to end the world. Powers does not do that. Nor does he play the issue down as some have. His information is backed by statistics, mostly presented in easy-to-read summary charts and tables. He prefaces the discussions of the various aspects of crimes with anecdotes that draw you into the topic, making you want to learn more. Overall, it is a very accurate, informative, and fun read.<br />  My primary two concerns with the book that kept me from the 5-star rating are (1) The chapters are long winded. (2) Some of the information is outdated.<br />  I wish that the author would have cut every section down in size by about 25%. Remember high school, when the teacher assigned a 5-page essay but you only had 4 pages of information? I don't know what the cause is, but this seems to be what Power did for many of the chapters. It takes away from the readability, but not significantly enough for me to suggest against this book.<br />  Simply due to the rapidly changing environment of networking, computer technology, and the internet, this book is necessarily mildly outdated, since it was written in 2000. However, this problem is not great. This is not a technical<br />&quot;how to stop cybercrime&quot; book. It is more of an overview of what cybercrime is, what it can look like, and what it isn't. Therefore, even if the nuances of the crimes or the nuances of the preventions have changed, the bird's-eye view of them has changed very little. This also should not keep you from this book.<br />  If you are interested in the subject buy this book. Now that so many copies are available so inexpensively by purchasing used, there is nothing to keep from reading this.available so inexpensively by purchasing used, there is nothing to keep from reading this.	2004-03-02

However, it is so much more than your standard church-discipline how-to book. Keeping the discussion and our hearts tempered by the glorious and gracious gospel of Jesus Christ--to whom we all owe every ounce of holiness, gentleness, and even our very lives--church discipline is put in its context. The legalism behind many attempts at discipline is shattered by the Gospel along with our fleshly tendency to be harsh, overbearing, and judgmental. Instead, the goal of discipline is repentance, restoration, and fruitfulness. This doesn't happen through programs, but happens with a pouring out of ones heart, bearing burdens in love, looking first to ourselves so that we might not be tempted. Discipline is gracious, yet firm. Discipline is not a one-time thing. The goal of discipline is repentance and restoration. Lauterbauch makes that very clear, understandable, and practical with his extensive and very candid use of anecdotal evidence from his life as a shepherd. His transparency, revealing both his great successful and dreadful shortcomings, lend credibility to his applications and reveal a level of wisdom that can only come with experience.<br />  However, for me, the greatest change with which I have walked away from this book is a renewed desire to have intimate and true fellowship with those in my small group and church. I need the oversight from those that can watch my heart to ensure that I do not grow cold. I need to be watching others hearts to shepherd their hearts as they grow calous by sin before they become unrepentant. I want to transform the community that is my small group into a Gospel-driven fellowship of believers, lovingly and graciously driving one another onto more God-glorifying lives.

Many people got so caught up on the mathematics of LaPlace Transforms that they did not even get to the point where they could begin understanding control systems.

I think that had I not sat down with this book for a weekend and taught myself LaPlace Transforms, I would have not passed that class.<br />Granted, this is a single case for a single class of a single bioengineering student; nevertheless, for my part I strongly recommend this book.  I was put in a class where the teacher expected the students to have an understanding of the mathematics from the start.  The majority of us didn't have that background, and this book clearly, simply, and without too much complication prepared me for my class which was exactly what I wanted it to do.  It has been one of the best investments (as far as school books go) of my college career.<br />I must leave you with one parting word of wisdom.  This book, and I don't think any other book dealing with such an advanced topic, is not easy to read.  You will not be able to thoughtlessly master the material.

If a little bit more detail were given, it would have saved me hours of stress and frustration only to realize that he didn't mention a certain setting that had to be changed.<br />It's your call. If you have the camera and want to learn some more tricks and have a lot of extra money, buy it. But, if you already have a pretty good feel for the camera and don't have much money left after the investment, I'd suggest waiting for a better book or just learning by goofing around with your camera.<br />__________<br />Since that time, I have used my Coolpix 5700 to take the photojournalistic shots at weddings as my wife takes portraits using her Canon EOS 10D.  The techniques that I learned because of this book have proven invaluable.  There are many improvements that can be made--indeed, that need to be made--to the book.

However, the fact that this book stirred up in us both a passion to share the Gospel, instilled a greater love for God, and humbled us greatly makes me want to give it six stars.  Amazon, unfortunately won't let me.<br />  I don't normally read Christian fiction...I don't normally read fiction at all.  I usually would prefer books like Piper's &quot;Desiring God&quot;, Stott's &quot;Cross of Christ&quot;, and Mahaney's &quot;Cross-Centered Life,&quot; but this book has made me aware of a whole genre of life-changing books which I would have downplayed had it not been for my encounter with this one.  Please read it, enjoy it, and then pass it on.	2003-12-28
US	44341716	R1VOGXB24MGP8H	0155009966	688324705	Lifespan Development	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Very readable, extremely poor proofreading is distracting	I've just completed a developmental psychology class this semester, so please understand that this review is coming from a student's perspective.  I am not a psychologist nor do I aspire to be one.  With that said, I will review this book which I have spent extensive time reading.<br />  The book is extremely readable.  The authors don't try to demonstrate their intelligence by using big words and long, convoluted sentences.  I took this class over the internet, so I did not have the benefit of a lecture.  Nevertheless, the book is so easy-to-read, yet full of information that I feel like I've walked away from the class with a good understanding of the subject.<br />  Yet I feel like I have to point out, if for no other reason than maybe the publishers will read it, that there are ridiculous number of typos in this book.  Some are so bad that a simple spell-checker would catch them.  Like on page 534 &quot;parenthood&quot; is spelled &quot;perenthood&quot;.  How does a book get to a 5th edition and still not have words spelled correctly?!  I would have given the book 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor editing because simply based on content and writing style, this has been one of my favorite textbooks, even if I don't agree with all of the content.<br />  This is a great textbook, and I would even encourage somebody who just wants a good overview of the topic to buy the book to read on your own.  Great read.  Poor editing.	2003-12-26

Recently, my wife and I made the investment of a Nikon 5700.  We are happy with the investment.  We also invested in this book, and we are definately less happy in this one.  I'm going to run down a list of pros and cons and you make the decision.  In the end, I'm glad I bought it.  It taught me some tricks I may never have figured out otherwise, but still I can't believe how much they charge for how little you get.<br />PROS:<BR>1. Better than the manual<BR>2. Gives examples of the techniques discussed.<BR>3. It's the only one that exists.<br />CONS<BR>1. WAY too expensive.  This book should cost about five bucks.  It looks like a guy printed it on his computer and took it to the copy shop.<BR>2. Some of the examples are too simplistic and assume too many steps.  If a little bit more detail were given, it would have saved me hours of stress and frustration only to realize that he didn't mention a certain setting that had to be changed.  <br />It's your call. If you have the camera and want to learn some more tricks and have a lot of extra money, buy it.  But, if you already have a pretty good feel for the camera and don't have much money left after the investment, I'd suggest waiting for a better book or just learning by goofing around with your camera.	2003-09-15

If you've taken more than one semester of Spanish in school, this book won't be able to help you much.  For me (my wife is Mexican and I have learned a lot from her.  I have also completed up through Spanish 201 in college), this book did not teach me a thing.  However, for my grandma who has no experience with Spanish and wanted to learn some voculary words in order to communicate easier, this book was perfect.  This book could be one of the most useful you have or one of the most useless, depending on who you are and at what level of Spanish you are at. Make sure that you need it before you buy it, but for two bucks you can't do much better if you are looking for a good vocaulary list.	2003-07-23

When I met her I didn't really speak much Spanish. I learned quite a bit by hanging out with her and taking classes. But no matter how hard I tried, no matter how much I paid attention and asked for help, I still made the mistakes that all gringos make: the dreaded &quot;gringaso.&quot; This book isn't a cure all. It won't make you speak Spanish perfectly. But it has pointed out some of my mistakes and has made it simple for me to correct them. I'm in Mexico right now as I write this review and have even used many of the lessons that I learned in this book in order to avoid getting laughed at by all her friends.<br />DO NOT get this book if you are not conversant in Spanish.<br />DO get this book if you are able to hold a conversation in Spanish and need to get rid of those incessant small mistakes that you make that make it obvious that you are a gringo.<br />This is the most helpful book that I have in helping me learn Spanish.	2003-07-23

I'm not 100% sure that the science behind this book is correct, but hey I'm not an expert.  This book may not help you lose weight or even help you stay out of the doctor's office.  Nevertheless, I am giving it four stars because it is an excellent gift for the chocolate lover in your life.  It really is a fun read (though it's not going to win any awards for its amazing prose) and gives you a great excuse to eat that extra candybar.	2003-07-16

I (a male) was at first apprehensive that some of my friends might find out that I was doing Pilates.  But as I saw my wife with this book struggling through the exercises, I thought \\"Wow! That looks hard. I don't know if I could do that.\\"  I'm a guy who's up for a challenge, so I began doing them with her.  Then watching us, my parents got hooked.  Instead of getting a book, however, they bought the Mari Windsor video series.  If it wasn't for me knowing about and now working with the videos, I would give this book 5 stars.  It very clearly, in full color pictures and very easy-to-read language demonstrates how to do Pilates.  I think it actually has helped me to perform the exercises on the video more correctly.  But since I now know just how good the videos are I have to drop the book to 4 stars since it just can't compete with its multimedia rival.<br />And now my friends who were making fun of me are actually working out with me.  Just last night my living room was full of people (male and female) \\"doing Pilates.\\"<br />In conclusion, I would recommend that you try the Winsor Pilates videos (the only other that I have seen is Pilates for Dummies and it is pretty bad), and then if you still need more help mastering the techniques this book is a good aid.	2003-07-16

Top 5 books I've read	I'll start out by telling you what this book isn't.  This book isn't an academic treatise on the cross.  It isn't meant to thoroughly dissect the doctrines of sanctification and justification and their relation to the cross.  It wasn't intended to exegetically prove anything.<br />What is was designed to do was to RADICALLY CHANGE YOUR LIFE GETTING YOUR MIND FOCUSSED ON THE CROSS and what Christ accomplished there.  I know that the book achieved its goal because it has had a profound effect on me.  There are very few books which so vividly stand out in my mind as tools that God has used to mold me into the image of His Son.<br />So often as we progress in the Christian life, we think that we must &quot;move on&quot; to the &quot;deeper&quot; things of the faith.  We begin to prioritize Bible study, then prayer, and maybe fasting.  We begin to serve in the church, and we develop doctrinal bases for doing all this.  Then maybe we begin to develop systematic theologies that define the way that we live encorporating everything from creationism to eschatology.  Then finally as &quot;mature&quot; Christians having spent tons of time thinking about the difficult and mind-stretching things of faith, we wonder where all of our growth is.  We aren't really much more useful than we were when we began, and we might long for the joy that was ours when we first repented and saw God's glory, grace, and grandeur.  What CJ points out is that so often we so distracted by important, but not central, points of the faith.  WE FORGET THE CROSS.<br />CJ Mahaney spends about 100 very small, very easy-to-read pages painting the picture (See Galatians 3:1) of Christ on the Cross and the consequences of that scene in the lives of God's elect.  This book walks us through the completeness and finality of justification, onto the continuing work of sanctification, and on into how all of these should effect our everyday lives.<br />This book stands in my lives in the ranks of Desiring God (John Piper) and The Enemy Within (Kris Lundgaard) as one of the three books that have most impacted me (aside from the Bible).  It isn't a book that is going to impress your friends by making them think that you're really smart, but through the Spirit's work in your heart, it will daily bring you to knees in repentence and to your feet in rejoicing.

Obviously with the release and already widespread acceptance of Photoshop 7, buying this book which focusses on version 4 is completely out of date.

I thought maybe it could give me some ideas for the sites that I'm working on.  This book has done much more than that.  Many times when I'm working on a site, something just doesn't &quot;feel&quot; right.  The only way that I've been able to fix that has been by redoing the entire site until it does &quot;feel&quot; right.  I didn't understand what was going on.  Peck has taught me, by using countless real-life examples and full-color screenshots from other professional sites, what was wrong.  My wife tells me every day how much better my pages have started to look.  Her words: &quot;Your stuff looked good before, but now it looks professional.&quot;  Buy this book; read this book; do what this book says.	2003-03-17

When Augustine was handing over his administrative duties to an assistant named Eraclius, Eraclius was asked to give a message.  As Augustine sat silently on the bishops throne behind, Eraclius said, \\"The cricket chirps, the swan is silent.\\"  This is how I feel looking at the way that God has impacted men like Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Edwards, Owen, and even Piper.  Being motivated by the grace that God has shown them in their lives and learning from their lessons, as I go out to the world with the motive of Paul that is seen in so many of these great men in history, \\"Him we declare, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom so that we may present everyone mature in Christ (Colossians 1:28 ESV),\\" my words feel like the chirps of crickets next to the songs of these gifted swans.  Sometimes, one of the best ways to let their songs be sung is to let them sing them for themselves through the words that they wrote and the testimony that they left.  That is what John Piper has done in this book, and it has definitely had its desired effect.	2002-06-18

I, in general, am not a big fan of systematic theology in its commonly understood sense.  Well, I better restate that.  I am not a big fan of the results of systematic theology.  It often makes for Christians who feel that they know everything and then begin to interpret the Bible to match their theology, instead of growing in knowledge through Bible reading and changing their theology to match the Bible.  The only other systematic theology books that I have read with any amount of thoroughness would be Berkhof's and Calvin's.  So I'm not claiming to be a top notch theologian.  But I do want to grow to more thoroughly understand God's revealed truth in his word, and then obey it.  Wayne Grudem's book is every bit as thorough as those others, maybe even more so.  He takes time to explain differing views, defining which are major and minor doctrines, giving thorough histories of the different views of the issues, and then ending each of the 57 chapters with a section title &quot;Questions for Personal Application.&quot;<br />  This application is what I have found extremely helpful.  They questions aren't anything that you couldn't think up on your own with a little thought.  It basically helps to guide you in your meditation and prayer over the Biblical truths just presented.  It helps get the focus back where it should be, God.  Instead of the goal being theology for theology's sake, the goal is the glory of God through a changed, obedient life, that then in turn changes other lives.  A changed life, changes lives.<br />I am considering using this book, even though it is 1290 pages for the small group Bible study that we have.  This has been a beneficial reference to me as I have been studying.	2002-02-12

The NASB and ESV (English Standard Version) are consistently, I feel, the most accurate translations.  They maintain a literal translation while being easy to read.  FOr a personal study Bible, I would recommend the ESV.  But the NASB would be my second choice.<br />But that isn't even what this review is about.  It is supposed to be about this little pocket version in particular.  I like it.  I did give it four stars because the cover is not very protective of the pages.  I have a little New King James Version that I was given by the Gideon's and it's cover is much more protective.  But still I take this little guy to school every day with me and it holds up.  There are so many different Bible styles out there.  Don't buy this one for study or anything, but if you want a Bible to carry in your pocket to work or school, this is a good one.	2002-02-12
