While making this journey they come across a band of souix renegades who have captured a white man and have him tied to a tree.  Reb is a good shot and they decide that the only way to free him is to shoot him (just above the heart) then go in and take care of the 8 braves.  It works out fine except one of them gets away.  Standing Buffalo is his name and he vows revenge on the three of them.  Then Reb and Adam take this stranger to \\"Blue's\\" cabin and Reb nurses him back to health.  While there they learn a lot about each.  His one biggest revelation is that she is a women.  He doesn't let on however but is waiting for the right time to teach her a lesson.

The story is about Amy and Jesse who have one of the only \\"stage stops\\" around where folks can get a meal and spend the night.  The book opens where they are burying their 2 year old son, Tim.  Amy blames herself and totally shuts down emotionally from everyone and becomes very status quo.  She doesn't want to talk about \\"it\\" or anything else that reminds her of losing Tim.  Jesse is very loving to Amy and wants nothing more than to grieve together but he can't seem to reach her.

She feels she deserves it because it was her fault and she just couldn't seem to feel.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more because I don't want to give it away...but you journey with them on trying to become whole again as persons as well as a couple.

Annie is thought to be a Moron after a fever she had when she was young.  She is made fun of and her parents keep her secretly hidden away.  Douglas Montgomery sees her in the woods and decides she looks pretty great physically.  After tormenting her, he ends up raping her.  Douglas's brother Alex is sick about this whole thing.

Thinking this was to be a marriage in name only with the intent to keep the child and then send Annie home after the birth.  But soon he begins to think by things she does that she is more intelligent than first thought.  From there....what a beautiful story of love and trust and discovery.  WOW!  I was a little apprehensive about reading a book like this but Catherine Anderson handled the situation so graciously.  What a hero Alex is!!!! Who wouldn't want him.  You will not regret this read.

What a storyline.  I thought the characters of Carly and Hank were both very deep.  I have grown to love the Coulter/Kendrick families.  They are so loyal to one another and have a deep love.  Hank wanted only to have a little fun with Carly..a one night stand, no strings.  But...Carly finds out that she's pregnant.  Hank has felt heartsick since that night and looks for her but he doesn't know her last name.  When he finds her he bullies her into getting married.  But...he finds that she is really everything he would have picked in a wife and wishes that things could have started differently.  He is so kind and gentle to her and always thinking of her and she appreciated all he does but is still very reserved because she knows that eventually when she goes blind he will leave her.  The story is very tender and shows that love can overcome all obstacles.  Love is for the long haul.  This is a keeper.  Highly recommend.	2004-12-16

It's the Ryan Kendrick (Rafe's brother in Baby Love) story.  He is a handsome, single, millionaire rancher who makes all the ladies swoon.  He meets Bethany Coulter and is instantly taken with her.  He asks her out for dinner and dancing and then she shows him she is in a wheel chair.  Most of the men she has met turn tail and run once they see that, but not Ryan.  He makes a date and keeps it and from that night on he is taken with her.  The story is about their developing love and how it can transcend any boundries.  It really is a beautifully written story.  Ryan is a hero alright.  I fell in love with the whole Kendrick family in \\"Baby Love\\" and they are just as lively in Phantom Waltz.  It's a keeper.	2004-12-14

I have to say this was one of my top 5 favorite books.  Rafe is such a tough yet tender guy.  One you would dream about.  Maggie is tough in her own right coming from an abusive situation.  She is running away and meets Rafe, who is also running but for different reasons.  He begins to look out for her and take care of her and the baby when she falls sick.  From that point on what a beautiful story to get caught up in.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good romantic story.  Some reviewers said that it's to good to be true, but I found it to be so captivating.  Besides, fact is stranger than fiction and there is probably someone out there who lived a story similar to this.  So READ IT!!! You won't be sorry.  Block out time, it's a hard one to put down.	2004-12-11

That was the simple, solid ideal that Daniel Lindsay willingly offered Rayna Ludgrin.  But she'd lived a grand passion, he knew, and he could promise only a quiet, steady brand of love...! <br /> <br />Her soul raw with a new widow's grief, Rayna Ludgrin vowed she'd never feel love again.  Still, life under the wide Montana sky was hard for a woman alone - and she pledged herself to Daniel Lindsay out of a desperate need to save her sons and her ranch.  But though she'd taken him into her home as husband, could she ever welcome him into her heart? <br /> <br />- - This is such a touching story.  It really pulls at the heartstrings.  The character development I thought was so believeable.  I also felt that the book was written in real time instead of rushing through situations.  Rayna was such a woman of strong character.  Her first love, whom she had been married to for 15 years, died suddenly from working in a field on too hot of day.  She is trying to make it by doing the work herself along with her two young sons.  Lots of neighbors came to offer to buy the land cheap or marriage but no help really.  Until Daniel Lindsey shows up and begins to help.  He is so kind and gentle toward her and her sons.  She knows he is a good man but her heart feels like it is betraying her first husband.  They have many things to go through but they don't have to do it alone. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book if you like sweet and endearing characters.  It really pulled at my heart strings.

Let me add that I throughly enjoyed the story and once started I couldn't put it down.  I love the characters in this book.  Roz is fiesty and independent and not interested in marriage at all but wants to be a journalist.  Her father is trying to marry her off and in frustration she takes off on her horse to go and think.  She is hiding near a bridge when she hears voices then 3 shots, then sees two bodies fall in the river who look like the wanted man that killed her friend's father.  One is floating down the river and one made it to shore.  Believing the man on shore to be dead she goes for a closer look.  All of a sudden (Eli) reaches out and grabs her and puts a hand over her mouth.  She goes with him out of fear and believes him to be a wanted murder.  As they travel together and she cares for his wounds (he was shot in the leg and a graze on the head) and they talk... she begins to doubt the validity of her thoughts that he is a cold blooded killer.  He thinks she is sassy and independent but he respects her because of it.  She begins to really feel drawn to him because of his inner strength and the fact that he likes her for who she is not because she has money or society connections.  She nurses him back to health and lays out a plan to clear his name.  It is this whole plan in which many mysteries come to light.  Although they are each feeling drawn to each other he really feels that once his name is cleared he must leave her.  He thinks that because he is a half-breed and not from society that she will be subject to gossip which he doesn't want to do to her.  What will he decide??????? <br /> <br />If you like action, humor, mystery and a happy ending then you will love this book.  I thought it was a great read.  I recommend it.	2004-12-02

I understand some of the points they tried to make about the story but I also understand that the influence of ones environment can shape the way we think.  In this case Dane had come from some pretty messed up situations as well as being wounded enough to have to step down from his law enforcement job.  What he needed was the love of a good woman and that would be Tess.  She had what it took.  Just when she had about given up.... you'll have to read to find out what happens.

There is a good review of Circles of Gold under that book so I won't mention what it is about.  Wedding in White is about Mack Killian and his 2 brothers and his sister.  Their parents are dead and he has been responsible for them for a number of years.  He is only in his 20's himself.  There is an orphan (named Natalie) that came to live with her aunt, which was right next to the Killian Ranch.  Natalie becomes a part of their family.  When she is 17 her \\"boyfriend\\" is killed in an accident and Mack comes to comfort her.  He has hidden his desire for her since then as he felt she was too young to shoulder all the responsibility he had and he felt that a wife was added responsibility for him.  But now she is 23 and his desire is becoming more apparent.  He is saying and doing things he has never done before.  She is liking it because she has always loved him too.  There is some tense moments and even betrayal but then Natalie moves away and is involved in an accident.  Mack is called because she has no other family.  What will happen??????

Cruz is a wonderful hero and his gentleness toward Slone is very tender.  Slone struggles to trust and love again after Cruz's brother betrayed her and left her pregnant and unwed.  She gives the baby to Cruz at birth and marrys him on paper only until such time and the man who killed Cruzs brother is brought to justice, then it is to be a real marriage.  This is their story of the stuggle to overcome the many things life passes our way.  I was a little disappointed that we didn't really see much of the other family in this book.  Frontier Woman and Comanche Woman were much more family interactive.  Nevertheless, it was still a good story and ties the triology together.  I recommend you read them in order.  They do stand alone but like any good family history it's best to get the information in order.  You feel like you know them all.   <br /> <br />All three books (Frontier Woman, Comanche Woman, Texas Woman) are really good stories but I have to say that Comanche Woman was by far my favorite.  All three heros were good men who were strong yet tender.  But there was something about Long Quiet that drew me in in Comanche Woman. <br /> <br />This series is a keeper for me!	2004-11-08

I read the negative reviews on Comanche Woman so I was a little apprehensive but I read Frontier Woman so I decided to go for it.  I did not feel at all like some of the other reviewers.  I thought it was a wonderful love story.  Long Quiet is a strong yet tender man who is torn between two worlds.  Being half comanche he has stayed true to that side of his heritage.  But Bay Stewart changes all that. She has always been tender hearted and has now been in captivity for 3 year but was bought by a kind comanche named Many Horses.   Lone Quiet ends up taking her as his bride and because of many threats against her life he decides that she won't be safe in even his own village.  So he takes her to her home and decides that she should forget him and that he will return to his village after the business he has to take care of.  But...will he really be able to stay in his village or will he return to try to claim Bay as his wife and live in the white world.  Through lots of ups and downs it does have a happy ending and there are lots of tender moments that I really enjoyed.  So take a chance.  I'm so glad I did.  For me this is a keeper.

I was not disappointed.  There was some great dialog in this book and some things that made me laugh.  There were also some very tender moments.  Judd is a very lovable hero.  Crissy is a good women, lots of sass and whit but she is also very loving and faithful.  Cash Grier add a great deal of spice to the story as well.  He's rough around the edges but it's hard not to love him.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it.  This is my first Diana Palmer book and I have already bought more.	2004-10-19

It was filled with romance, mystery and several exciting parts and tender moments.  I also enjoyed the unusual friendship between Shane and Marsh.  Marsh is falling for Calera but he knows that Shane is the only man in her eyes.  Despite his best efforts to make her forget Shane.  Marsh is also intrigued by the skill and commance that Shane possessed.  Shane is a wonderful hero.  One that any girl would feel honored to have love her.  Calera was willing to learn many of the Apache ways and throughout the book she uses those skills.  I highly recommend this book.  It will be a keeper on my self for furture re-reads.  You won't be disappointed....read it!	2004-10-11

I loved all the books in the Texas Series (\\"A Marriage By Chance\\", \\"The Texan\\", \\"Tempting a Texan\\" and the fourth in that series was \\"Texas Gold\\").  It was such a good book.  From the beginning, you are drawn into the story and it is sweet to see that although Faith guards her heart against being hurt, Max is very tender and patient.  There are many things they discover about each other along their journey of the heart.  I highly recommend TEXAS GOLD.  It's a keeper.  I have gone back to re-read it several times.  Thanks Carolyn for your great work!!!!!	2004-10-03

When Maddie bursts into John Danhill's room and announces that he better not tell the two men chasing her that she is there.  She then goes on to tell him that she got in his room because she told the clerk that she was his wife.  From that point on you can't put the book down.  It is a book with wonderful characters and good dialog between the characters.  Maddie is quite a spitfire and he admires that about her.  I also enjoyed the friendship between John and Boone.  I would have given this more than 5 stars.  It is a keeper on my shelf.  I highly recommend it!! You won't be disappointed.	2004-09-30

I loved this book, which has been reviewed nicely below.  I was glad for the one reviewers mention of the other 3 books in the saga and the order in which to read them.  What a great story.  I do have to say that \\"The Half-Breed\\" was my very favorite.  Chase is a hero to die for and Faith is a women to look up to.  So..thank you Bobbi for another great adventure.	2004-09-24

The story between Casey and Michael unfolds before your eyes and what starts out to be an arranged marriage turns into something much deeper.  Also the way Casey is transformed from a \\"boyish\\" ranch hand to a beautiful women is fun. It's fast paced, funny, tender and one you'll want to keep on your bookshelf for re-reading.

This story opens when Jessie Monroe is on her way (with her children) to see her brother, at McKinnon Ranch, where he works.  She is widowed and coming to him for some help. When she gets there she finds that her brother has been fired but Ty McKinnon said he thought his brother Cade was looking for a cook/housekeeper.  She decides to take the job.  The moment that Cade and Jessie meet they are attracted.  You later find out why her brother was fired.  It has to do with cattle rustling and a couple of shady characters.  I won't say anymore because I don't want to give it away.  If you like a good old fashioned romantic page turner... this is the book for you.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.  Sharon's characters are moral yet not unbelievable.  Sharon...another GREAT book.  I can't wait for the next one.  This is staying on my shelf for a re-read.    Another great one by Sharon is For Love of Anna.	2003-03-30

For Love of Anna is no exception.  The quality of her characters is always so refreshing.  I highly recommend this book to those who love a good old fashioned romance.
