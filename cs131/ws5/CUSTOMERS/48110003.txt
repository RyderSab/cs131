A moving collection of vignettes about life on Prince Edward Island during the Great Depression, as seen through the eyes of a young boy who battled the miseries of starvation and neglect until he was old enough to join the military and escape. <br /> <br />For all of us who only associated P.E.I. with the idyllic works of L.M. Montgomery (of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES fame), this little collection of Gallant's is a very sharp poke in the eye.  You are not going to find fond reminiscences of golden summer days and cozy Christmases.  John Gallant tells about his worthless father who refused to do any work and a brother with a suspiciously \\"sore back\\" who was much the same.  There are stories concerning the parish priest who, through his greed and mean spiritedness, made Gallant question if believing in a religion was really worth the effort.  Since Heaven, for Gallant, consisted of enough food to eat and a warm place to sleep, why believe in what didn't exist? <br /> <br />Told in simple terms with honesty and very dry humor, this collection will be sure to please short story enthusiasts, as well as anyone interested in Canada and the Great Depression. <br />	2004-08-27
US	48110003	R1XRT8WDVO1M2U	0595659446	439596399	The Eye of Odin	Books	3	12	13	N	N	3 1/2 stars, actually	Larson's novelization of the Viking Age is both compelling and informative.  His primary focus is on the life of Erik the Red and his family, intersperced with detailed overviews of the political and religious climate of Norway and Iceland in the tenth Century.  The reader is treated to detailed accounts of exciting ocean battles between longships, bloody raids, the evil exploits of the psychotic Bagnold, and the political intrigues that raged in the court of Christian King Hakon and his Pagan subjects.  <br /> <br />In many ways, Larson's narrative is reminiscent of James Michener's sweeping sagas.  A chapter will focus on a character's personal journey, and then telescope out to look at how the entire region at the time was being influenced by foreign trade and forced migration (in the form of Thorvald's banishment and Erik's voyaging).   <br /> <br />Larson does not waste time with sympathetic hand wringing over such topics as war and slavery.  It was a brutal age, and the author does his best to portray it accurately, while attempting to make the characters accessible to modern readers. <br /> <br />This is a first novel, and it does contain some faults.  For example, Chapter One would have made an ideal Prologue, since it sets up the time and environment nicely; but does not introduce the protagonists very well.  While Larson is good at \\"telling\\" the reader what is happening, there is a noticeable lack of \\"showing\\" what is going on.  The characters could have spent more time actually doing the things Larson is describing (i.e. Erik doing Winter activities would have fleshed out his persona and made him more interesting). <br /> <br />Another point in Larson's favor is his attempt to recreate the spirituality of the time in the person of Ragnar, priest of Odin and friend of Thorvald and Erik.  Researching the Sagas and studying the works of scholars like Edred Thorsson, Larson has done a good job of trying to recapture what it must have been like to worship theGods of the North and follow their teachings.    <br />With the promise of another novel, WOLFGAR, in the offing, Larson has set himself a mighty challenge as a new voice for Viking Age and Nordic focused novels.   <br /> <br />Recommended.	2004-08-16

Lovecraft was at the hub of a small circle of weird fiction writers, artists and enthusiasts.  Even the most casual note sent in by a fan of his work would often receive a wonderfully long and detailed letter by way of thanks.  Were it not for HPL's mammoth correspondence, writers like Frank Belknap Long, Clark Ashton Smith, E. Hoffmann Price, August Derleth, and Donald Wandrei would never have gotten to know one another and, very possibly, might not have persued writing careers with nearly as much fervor and creative imagination.<br />This book is a record of the friendship that developed between HPL and Donald Wandrei who, as a 19-year-old University of Minnesota student in 1926, one day decided to write a fan letter. For the next ten years, the two men would exchange views on everything from the \\"weird\\" influence on art and literature to the woes of trying to get Hugo Gernsback, editor of WEIRD TALES, to pay for the stories he bought.  <br />Readers will also find interesting Wandrei's hitching odessey in the Summer of 1927, when he went from St. Paul to New York City to Providence, Rhode Island (bumming lifts all the way) in order to visit HPL from July 12-29.<br />There is also a great deal of humor to be garnered from these letters, especially HPL's near obsession with a cheap eatery called JAKE'S (where you could get a complete meal for 25 cents) and a precursor to Baskin and Robbins called MAXWELL'S, where HPL would take visitors and stage ice cream eating contests.<br />The only truly sad notes were HPL's consistent failures to secure a steady writing job and his persistent racism (also shared by Wandrei, at least while he explored New York).  While certainly a blot on their characters, it does add to rendering a more complete picture of two creative people: one a neophyte, the other a rather weary and disillusioned veteran.	2003-04-25

Lauded for his brilliant oratory skills and personal beauty, Ambrosio is courted by the richest women in the city to be their personal Confessor.  As Ambrosio's fame increases, so does his vanity, and it is through this Deadly Sin that he enters into later acts of violence and depravity.  <br />Lewis does a fine job of creating archetypal characters that are still used in genre fiction today.  There is the Fallen Hero who becomes the Villian (Ambrosio), the Temptress (Rosario/Matilda), the Good Knights (Lorenzo and Don Raymond), and two Damsels in Distress (Agnes and Antonia).  The author also provides a subordinate Villian (the Prioress of the Convent of St. Clare), who is in some ways more evil than Ambrosio. <br />For leavening in this very dark narrative, Lewis gives readers a trio of humorous characters: Leonella, Antonia's lusty aunt and chaperone; Flora, the very chatty chambermaid in Antonia's service; and Jacintha, the superstitious neighbor who swears that she sees ghosts everywhere.  <br />The characterizations of Ambrosio and the Prioress are great examples of how power (whether it's spiritual or temporal) can corrupt.  Neither character feels answerable to anyone.  Even God isn't really present (although his Other Half puts in an appearance!)  Lewis poses questions on personal accountability that are certainly relevant today, while deftly mixing in good character interaction and biting social commentary.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-04-20

If you don't have access to the 5-volume \\"Selected Letters\\" (published by Arkham House), this book is indispensible.  This  collection of letters spans Lovecraft's adulthood and covers such diverse topics as writing, eighteenth century antiquities, philosophy, politics, racism, economics, cats, travel, and even the art of buying a cheap suit!  <br />Veteran Lovecraft scholars will enjoy this work because of the editors' efforts at placing each selection of letters in its proper context.  These little annotations assist the reader in gaining a better understanding of the author's need to communicate with kindred spirits (despite his avowed misanthropy), his attempts to battle his depression with satiric humor, and the sometimes extreme lengths undertaken to cope with the slide into poverty and near starvation.<br />Well researched and ably constructed, Joshi and Schultz's offering is a welcome addition.  Highly recommended.	2002-10-15

Special attention is given to Burnett's novel &quot;Through One Administration&quot;, which was much lauded in its day for its insight and plausibility (and the fact that it did not have a guaranteed happy ending).<br />Along with providing brief but concise biographical data on Burnett (heavily citing Thwaite), Bixler's work is a helpful and informative source for readers interested in the artist's personal, as well as professional, life.	2002-09-09

There's Thomson, the woman-hating recluse whose hobby is to write scathing reviews in the margins of library books before returning them; Mrs. Rubenstein, who believes enjoyment must be tempered with suffering to be real; Peabody, a mousy woman who feels guilty about everything, and a host of other folks who come complete with assorted quirks and closely guarded pasts.<br />Just like in her children's books, Jansson's style is witty and uncluttered.  She doles out enough snippets of the characters' earlier lives to maintain the reader's interest and never indulges in &quot;we have to change the system&quot; bombast.<br />An excellent contrast to her earlier work, &quot;The Summer Book&quot;.	2002-09-09

It doesn't take a great intellect to discern her meaning.  It does require a bit of patience to get through all the furious flag waving and name calling.  Her constant use of the term \\"the framers\\" (in lieu of the Founding Fathers) and various forms of the word \\"pervert\\" for Clinton got old very fast.  She also couldn't decide if Clinton \\"molested\\" interns or had affairs with them (two very different actions). At times, her book seemed more like a tabloid  than an investigation into the alleged crimes of the former President.<br />In her defense, she tries to do a thorough job by sifting through all the scandals and supposed cover-ups.  If she could have tempered her language and insults, the book could have been a lot more interesting.	2002-08-11

Brought together by their intense interest in Spiritualism, Houdini and Conan Doyle would come to stand at opposite sides of the issue.  While Doyle embraced it as a new religion, Houdini undertook a crusade to expose fraudulent mediums by demonstrating their methods.<br />While firmly in the Houdini camp of skepticism, Polidoro manages to treat Doyle with a great deal of deserved respect.  The book gives many examples of how the two men tried to assist one another in psychic investigations (at least in the early years); and how Houdini's widow, Beatrice, maintained a relationship with the Doyles that was both touching and cordial.  <br />Interesting and educational, Polidoro's dual bio is recommended reading.	2002-03-08

The only things she can do to occupy her time is practice origami and think about how trapped she is.<br />Until she folds a little, brown paper boat...<br />What follows is Janessa's magical journey into Asgard, home of the Norse gods.  She receives a golden Ring of Protection from Odin, the All-Father, confronts Giants and Elves, and has to outwit Loki, mischief-maker in Asgard.<br />Ms. Smith does a good job in creating a young female character who not only has to deal with her injuries; but also has to learn that it's okay to be angry and make demands (not just wait passively for the world to help you).<br />The only real shortcoming in the book was the lack of descriptive material concerning Asgard, Valhalla, and, especially, the Elves of Ivaldi (where Janessa has her big moment).  We don't even know what the Elves actually look like, only that they live in a cave and wait for Loki to bring them things from the outside world. An extra fifty pages would have been ideal for readers to get a fuller picture of this alternate reality.	2002-02-22

Yeats	Books	2	4	4	N	N	revealing, but unsatisfying	Maddox's focus is on the people that revolved around Yeats--his wife, lovers, relatives, and peers.   She relays several intimate anecdotes concerning Yeats's troubled relationships with his parents, his obsessions with women like Maude Gonne and her daughter, Iseult, and his interaction with a long line of \\"mother figures\\" (most notably, Lady Gregory).<br />Reading this book gave me the impression that Yeats wrote not just because he was inspired by Ireland and metaphysical themes; but as a need to escape his stifling environment. <br />While providing many interesting details about Mrs. Yeats's \\"abilities\\" with automatic writing, Maddox goes far in portraying Georgie as more of a controlling wife than a powerful medium.  This, along with Yeats's own \\"psychic experiences\\" may lead a skeptic to wonder just how sane the poet actually was.<br />The section dealing with his term as a Free State Senator was good, in terms of illustrating Yeats' ongoing battle against censorship and civic divorce (in contrast with his reported stances on fascism and eugenics). Readers can revel in how Yeats, while conservative in such things as parenting, thoroghly enjoyed playing the \\"dirty old man\\" in various media--print, theater, and radio.  As far as a deeper insight into Yeats as mystical poet, though, the book's treatment of the man is sketchy at best.	2002-02-20

Thorsson gives concise definitions of the Younger Futhark and some suggestions for their layouts in divination.<br />I also enjoyed reading his abbreviated outline of Germanic magical history, from around 1100 a.c.e. to the present.  Thorsson goes far to explain how the German National Socialist movement co-opted and perverted the Teutonic mythology and symbology in order to conquer others.  <br />Recommended for beginners.	2002-02-19

Like a lot of folks, I grew up on the \\"Little House\\" books.  I still have my cherished copies from grade school, and always look forward to cracking them open every few years.  So, when I saw this book listed in my local library, I checked it out with an eager heart.<br />I'm glad that I can return it.<br />This has to be one of the driest books that I've ever read.  It reads more like a doctoral thesis than the biography of a relatively unsung literary figure.  Chapter Seven's \\"The Road to Baghdad\\" took longer for me to read than it probably did Rose to make the actual trip.  I found the sections dealing with her actual writing after returning from Albania to be the most interesting (especially Ch. 12, \\"Courage\\", and Ch. 13,\\"Credo\\").  In these, we really get to see Rose doing what she does best--editing her mother's work and crafting her own stories--as well as seeing the development of early libertarian philosophy.<br />Holtz's obsession with mintuae practically doubled the size of the book. Do we really need to know the intimate details of Rose's spending habits and subsequent complaints of poverty?  Does hearing about her money problems in EVERY single chapter make for good storytelling?<br />Plus, the constant repetiton of the \\"Wandering Jew\\" motif rapidly became tedious. Okay...Rose wanted to live forever so she could witness the evolution of humanity...we get the picture, so knock it off.<br />I think the subject would have been far better served if Professor Holtz had just compiled the original articles and correspondence into book form and provided annotation when needed.	2002-02-15

In Sorenson's retelling of the coming of Ragnarok, the author treats the Norse Gods in much the same manner as Homer treated the Greek Deities--less like divinities and more like a large, noisy, and oftentimes dysfunctional family.  <br />Everyone in Asgard has a personality and a private agenda.  Odin is very much the distant father who, at the same time, aches because his duties simply will not permit him to have a closer relationship with his family.  Loki, while certainly a trickster character, does possess flashes of regret for things as they come to pass with Ragnarok.  Balder is just trying to get others to be decent to one another.  Thor, while portrayed as a bit of a &quot;redneck&quot;,  is one of the most interesting characters.  You can't help but admire his tenacity, especially over the retelling of his fishing expedition against the Great Serpent.<br />Another plus with this book is the author's afterword about why he chose to end the book with Ragnarok, and not to write about the paradisical remaking of the world.  <br />Definitely worth keeping!	2002-02-08

While the surface plot is about two people, Leo and the mysterious Veronica, racing against (and through) time in order to rescue Veronica's magician father, Albin White; what made this story so rich is the plethora of mystical symbolism that dotted every single page.<br />Tibetan magical practices, hermetics, the tarot, lunar cartographical history, and the number 8 all mingle together to provide a complex and multi-layered landscape.  Along with the symbols, &quot;Veronica&quot; has a supporting cast that are as strange and interesting as anything out of a Terry Gilliam film.  Among them, there's Clement, Veronica's pickpocketing brother, who has a talent for spectral photography; Otto, a man obsessed with the number 8; Remi Sing, a one-eyed artist whose paintings look like scars in a snowstorm; and Keko, blind courtesan with a passion for the moon and whose apartment is precisely duplicated in a fishtank.  Then, of course, there's Starwood, Albin White's nemesis whose sole purpose in life is to destroy everthing White loves.<br />This isn't a typical sword-and-sorcery fantasy.  Christopher's work is more like Patricia McKillip's &quot;Stepping From the Shadows&quot; or Charles de Lint's &quot;Someplace to be Flying&quot;.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-02-07

When she's in top form, Misty can create a world full of characters so rich and vibrant, you truly can feel what they are going through.  In the aforementioned &quot;Arrows&quot; books, as well as in &quot;The Last Herald-Mage&quot; series, Lackey has shown that she's capable of moving readers to tears.<br />With &quot;Firebird&quot;, there was no need for kleenex.<br />Not that it wasn't good.  Lackey's take on the Russian fable was interesting.  Readers are given a good overview of medieval life under the boyars and Great Tsar (Ilya's interaction with the &quot;bannik&quot; in the steambath was both humorous and insightful).  <br />The  detailed descriptions of various environments (i.e. going from Ivan's palace, to the woodsman Yasha's simple home in a maze, to the grandeur of the Katschei's estate) helped in developing the novel's changing atmosphere in general,  while illustrating changes in Ilya's physical and emotional state in particular.  Lackey has a real talent for placing her characters in situations of danger/momentary safety/back to danger again.<br />The criticism lies in that Lackey tends to let her characters overthink certain situations.  She sometimes has Ilya pondering his next decision for several pages, when a couple of tightly written paragraphs would have sufficed.  It seemed to take Ilya a mighty long time to leave his abusive father, whereas Ilya's brother, Pietor, heads out after one very well-plotted scene.  Ilya's time as a &quot;monster&quot;/spy in the Katschei's palace seemed to take forever as well.  While Lackey probably wanted to make sure her character saw the situation from all possible angles, the story's pacing suffered because of it.<br />Again, on an up note, I did like the final chapter and how Ilya had to deal with his own &quot;happily ever after&quot; scenario.  It's definitely a &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; situation!<br />I do recommend the book, but there are others of Lackey's that I would put ahead of this one.	2002-01-28

Christianity and the Old Religion of the area seem to rub together well enough.  While there is an evil sorceress, Margaret, who is trying to indirectly kill her daughter, Elinor, witchcraft has its positive side in that the people of Albian relied on their hedgewitches to scry the future and cure their ills.<br />Elinor, who disguises herself as a man in order to find employment in the King's kitchen, is an interesting figure.  She is not a great warrior queen or lightning-fingered mage.  She is a middle-aged woman just trying to survive after having everything taken from her.  What Elinor lacks in humor or liveliness of spirit, Sherman suffuses her with discipline, focus, and total devotion to the tasks at hand.  This makes for a rather grim character, but all the more compelling.<br />While I wished that the book could have been more \\"gay positive\\",  the story would probably have rang less true.  The young king is struggling to cope with his sexuality while, at the same time, trying to provide for the needs of his kingdom and subjects.  His resolution at the end of the tale, while not the most satisfactory, is perhaps more \\"realistic\\" because of it.<br />Recommended.	2002-01-21

Instead, McKillip has crafted an enchanted landscape within the fractured persona of Frances, a girl who has created a horned creature called the Stagmen who embodies all that she fears and desires.  <br />From the beginning of the novel, McKillip weaves (and ensnares) Frances in religious imagery.  There are all the teachings and trappings of Roman Catholicism in which Frances is raised and educated, as well as the rich pagan themes in whatever natural environment she happens to be living in (i.e. the sonoran desert, the mountains of Germany, the English countryside, even the shores of Northern Washington State).  Frances splits herself into a sort of insane Trinity: the Frances who writes tales about the Stagman, giving him life; the Frances who is so afraid of everything vital that she tries to disappear, so the Stagman can't touch her; and then there's the bold Frances, desparately wanting to free herself from the soul-killing fear so she can either join with the Stagman or (maybe) become him.<br />A very touching and mature story fit for anyone who hurts, or for those who are trying to understand how and why some people just don't seem to be &quot;normal&quot;.	2002-01-05

Queen Silver is one of those people that should be presented in any high school civics class (if such things still exist).  <br />McElroy has given readers a book that can be appreciated on different levels.  It can be read as a straightforward biography, detailing not only Queen's life but that of her mother, Grace Vaughn Silver, socialist lecturer and union advocate, who was the dominant figure in Queen's life.  At 17, Grace left an abusive home with 5.00 in her pocket and the determination never to be anyone's slave.  Ten days after giving birth to Queen, the pair resumed the lecture circut and Queen's life of freethought and self-education began.  <br />This book also serves as a valuable collection of lectures and essays, illustrating Queen's diverse interests.  These writings cover a wide variety of subjects, from the lesser known subversive works of Mark Twain to one of the earliest explorations of the Salem Witch Trials.<br />McElroy has written an engaging history of one of America's more intriguing subversives.	2002-01-04

On the darker side, the author submits personal accounts of people in her own life that have sacrificed their freedoms, intellect, and even the safety of their own children in order to be a part of a religious system that offers to do the thinking for them.<br />One does not need to be an atheist to get something out of this book.

The &quot;Morning Ritual&quot; in Chapter 7 (&quot;Magickal Living&quot;) is a very useful exercise for those who feel the need to &quot;recharge&quot; their spirit; but the author is honest enough to state that one needs to practice this ritual every day for a solid month. <br />I like her mini-explanations for her various oil recipes; but I agree with others that, in order to get even a portion of the required oils, one needs to make a pretty hefty investment. Then again, this is all just an aid to magick, not a requirement.<br />Including stories about her personal life and occult experience helped make the book more accessible to readers. They can &quot;come along&quot; on her journey for a while and see how her life has shaped her magick.<br />A couple of things that gave me pause were in Section Three, &quot;Shadow Work&quot;. In Chapter 14 (&quot;Animal Magick and Shape-Shifting&quot;), Galenorn writes: The other method for shape-shifting is to physically change into that animal. Highly spiritual cultures still exist in which the shamans claim this is possible. I believe them. (pg. 230).  All right, which &quot;highly spiritual cultures&quot; specifically? She doesn't bother to name these cultures that still practice shape-shifting. If the author would mention what these cultures are, it would lend credence to her statement.<br />Another strange statement is in Chapter 15 (&quot;Drawing Down the Moon: Goddess Rituals&quot;). The author writes, &quot;It is impossible to say how magick developed during prehistory, but develop it did.&quot; (pg. 235). It sounds like the author really wants to believe magickal-based practices existed in the misty depths of pre-recorded history; but she doesn't have any hard evidence to back up the claim. Sure, it could be true; but that is not the same as saying, &quot;It IS true.&quot;<br />Still, this is a good and useful text that can aid the reader in finding their Path. Easy to read; but not fluffy and saccharine sweet.	2001-04-01

While investigating, Pitt is reunited with a relative he hasn't seen since &quot;The Cater Street Hangman&quot;, who is now taking up orders for the Anglican Church.  We are given a whirlwind tour through the Bohemian lifestyle, and are privy to several characters' struggle to bolster and preserve their relgious convictions in the wake of Charles Darwin's landmark theory on the evolution of the human race.<br />While I didn't think that this was one of her best works, I did feel that Perry was trying to do something different with regards to involving one of the prime suspects in the actual sleuthing process (in this case, Charlotte's widower brother-in-law, Dominic Corde).  As I read the book, I felt that Corde, in some ways, made more progress than Pitt.  It does make a sort of sense though, since Corde lived in the same house as Bellwood.<br />I was disappointed that Perry's more interesting supporting characters, Great-Aunt Vespasia and Charlotte's mother, Caroline, barely get a mention.  Charlotte's Grandmama only got one good scene, and she is great for comedic relief. I wish Perry could have somehow involved these ladies more in her exploration of how feminism affected them personally. That could have been really interesting.<br />Still, kudos to Perry for trying something different.  Wish it could have been better.	2001-04-01

I wish that I could have experienced this masterpiece when I was 12 or 13.  That way, I could have grown up rereading this trilogy until the covers fell off!  Oh, well... anytime is perfect to jump into Pullman's dramtic universe.<br />Lyra's capture and visions of the Land of the Dead are thoroughly gripping.  I no longer could say that her captor was 100% evil, which is a credit to Pullman's character development.  His villians are far too complex to hate with perfect impunity.<br />With regards to the actual Land of the Dead, I can't remember when I have read another author who could create a landscape that was so vivid in its despondency.  It was like walking through the bombed out ruins of Dresden after World War II (and that's just the entryway!)<br />I also loved Mary Malone's interaction with the mulefa, the wonderfully strange creatures who live in absolute harmony with their environment.  If you have ever read the space trilogy by C.S. Lewis, you might see some parallels between the mulefa world and Lewis's middle book, &quot;Perelandra&quot;.<br />There are so many wonderful instances and scenes in this book that its impossible for me to pick one favorite.  I think that one major theme in this book (and in the whole series) is the importance of keeping promises.  Lyra and Will not only will do anything for each other, but they are also willing to sacrifice their very beings to help their friends and loved ones.<br />It feels good to read about imperfect people who discover thier hidden talents and use them to better serve those around them.  An apt reminder for both children and adults.	2001-03-28

While I do not agree with all of the author's claims about Witchcraft being a science on par with physics (see Chapter 5), I must admit that I admire Cabot for a least giving a DETAILED account for her beliefs and practices (I enjoyed reading her account and definitions of the Hermetic Laws).  <br />Most entry-level Craft books just give the reader a quickie lesson in Circle-casting, a brief list of popular Deity Names, and a few Moon spells.  Cabot actually tries to give evidence in support of her claims.  It's up to the reader to decide whether or not he/she agrees with Cabot.<br />I also have to credit the author with being honest and saying that there is no &quot;quick fix&quot; spell that is going to solve a person's problem.  Chapter 6, which deals with reaching a state of consciousness termed &quot;Alpha&quot; is actually quite fascinating. Cabot writes that this mental state can also be attained by people of other religions whenever they pray or meditate; AND that it takes more than a couple of attempts to acheive this level of consciousness.  Cabot stresses that &quot;going into Alpha&quot; is vital to being successful in practicing the Craft.  While others practioners may certainly debate the semantics, visualization of some kind is emphasized in most books on the Craft.<br />Chapter 9, &quot;Witchcraft Tomorrow&quot; is a nice wrap-up to the text.  She gives good suggestions for Witches, and others of the Pagan community, to establish a positive public image (i.e.  participating in community services; presenting lectures on the Craft and the various branches of Paganism; and inviting theologians of other religions to actually study and talk with members of alternative faiths, etc...)<br />A good book that tries to dig a little deeper into a particular Path.	2001-03-13

It was not marketed as an actual religious text of any stripe.  <br />I think that this book can be used to open up discussion between open-minded parents and their kids.  If a young person sees something in the book and asks, &quot;what's this?&quot;, parents then have the opportunity to actually TALK to their kid(s) about something ancient and potentially meaningful.<br />Sure, there are better books on the history and practice of magic and witchcraft; but this book is meant to spark an interest, not encompass an entire cirriculum.	2001-03-09

For such a little book, it is loaded with Tarot history and helpful information on the definitions of each card and suit.  I especially enjoyed looking at the wide variety of sample cards from various decks.    Lionnet also presents several different layouts, besides the usual &quot;Three Card&quot; and &quot;Celtic Cross&quot;, that encourage diverse experimentation.<br />Another helpful item was the collection of &quot;sample readings&quot; at the end of the book.  Lionnet applies each layout (i.e. Jungian, dual Options, Celtic Cross, etc...) to a specific Querent and then discusses each card in the spread in relation to the other cards.<br />A handy book for either the casual or the merely curious, this would make a great gift.	2001-03-09

It does read like a &quot;first work&quot; in that it has quite a few &quot;tag on&quot; sentences at the ends of paragraphs, and the pace of the book was a bit stilted.  <br />However, I did appreciate the organization of the chapters, each one focusing on a specific Sabbat, Rite, or Moon Phase.  This separation of spiritual aspects is nice for easy reference and allows the reader to really dig into a specific area of the Craft.<br />Seekers of &quot;Traditional&quot; Wicca may find Hawke's use of Yoga and Tantric references a bit jolting; but she does a good job of blending her own spiritual experiences to bring forward another unique interpretation of an ever-evolving religion.	2001-03-06

The book is geared for group work and maintains the male/female, hierarchical system of Gardnerian Wicca.<br />Personally, I prefer Valiente's books on modern Craft history; but this text does possess some merit if one is looking to expand their knowledge on how a coven can be run.	2001-02-11

But, the denoument was a realistic and satisfying conclusion.<br />One thing that I wish Edghill would do is develop the backgrounds of her principal characters.  There's no mention of what brought Bast to the decision of joining the Craft.  What was she in her pre-Craft existence?<br />The villian was a bit contrived, as well.  The motive for murder was fine, though typical.  Edghill's fleshing out of the baddie was lacking, dare I say it, &quot;human interest&quot;.  Sure, the villian is a vehicle and foil for the hero's progression through the narrative; but, a villian should also be able to do something more than be mean and wave about a firearm.<br />What I found more interesting was the interplay between Bast and her fellow coven members.  Edghill once again blows up the myth that all pagans and Witches are loving and chummy with one another.  Bast has to make a decision whether or not to &quot;leave the nest&quot; because, even in the best of circumstances, people do grow apart.<br />A good book, but not as good as the first.	2001-01-26

Unfortunately, Bast does everything else but that!  She deals with the realities of no longer being able to lean on her old coven for support, and wrestle with the prospect of founding a new one.  There's her struggle in sorting out how she's going to find a stable magical partner.  And, to cap it off, inter-Community politics rears its ugly head once again and requires Bast to make the painful choice of keeping a trust or doing what is right.<br />Meanwhile, there's blessed little sleuthing. I think Bast's single intimate encounter with the killer was a rather obvious attempt by the author to drop a Major Hint early on.<br />As a foray into modern Neo-Paganism, it hits the target.  For a mystery novel, its more than a tad weak.	2001-01-26

Like many folks, I find that the second installment in a trilogy is often the weakest.  The author usually runs out of steam, or doesn't care about his/her characters enough to put them into as interesting a set of situations as they were in with volume #1. Perhaps, the author feels that he/she can take a breather and bring everything up to speed with #3.<br />Not so with Pullman.  He delivers a wallop with the first page and doesn't let up.  Pullman also ends the book with a set of cliffhangers that must have made readers absolutely nuts until &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; arrived.<br />The tenderness is still there (I nearly cried over the parts about Will's mother).  The evil Mrs. Coulter is again on the scene, totally amoral and vicious, but not so &quot;perfectly evil&quot; that she seems unreal.  Lyra is as tough and smart as always, while still making mistakes and paying for them.  Pullman is also brave enough to kill off a few of his favorites, which keeps up the plausibilty level and propels the survivors forward.<br />And the concept of a righteous war in Heaven...!  The author shows a tremendous amount of courage even to bring up the subject, let alone tackle it to the degree he does.  Readers may disagree with him; but they will be forced to think about his ideas.<br />Very, very good.	2001-01-24

For years, I thought the sub-sub-sub-genre of positive urban pagan fiction, with a good witch as the central character, began and ended with Mercedes Lackey's creation, Diana Tregarde.<br />Happily, I stand corrected.<br />Bast (aka &quot;Karen Hightower&quot;), is one of those characters whom I would love to meet in real life--intelligent, funny, flawed and very stubborn.  Upon recieving a distraught phone call concerning the death of a pagan newbie, Bast finds herself winding through a maze of black magic, coven politics, and religious fakery (saying something is &quot;Wicca&quot; when there isn't even a shadow of a resemblance).  <br />Edghill also provides a wonderful tour of the Manhattan pagan scene (good, bad, and downright nasty).  The author is not above taking a well-aimed shot at the hyprocracies lodged in both the mainstream and alternative religions.  <br />Bast is also portrayed as having a &quot;Real Life&quot;.  Ever notice how, in some books, the protagonist is described as having a profession; but doesn't spend a lot of time working at it? Too busy tracking down evil oogies from the Netherworld, I guess. Kudos to Edghill for having the sense to not only require her brain-child to hold down a nine-to-five job as a graphics designer and layout person, but have Bast actuall *go to work* during the story.  Manhattan rent aren't paid in fairy lights and levin bolts, ya know!<br />Good work on developing a villian who is a classic in Occult fiction: the ultimate head-tripper who truly believes their own press. You'll see how the abuser sets the stage, chats up the victim, begins to extract promises and behavior that no ethically-minded person should ever do, and then begins to demonstrate what happens when the victim tries to escape.  A good guide for all Seekers, no matter the Path.<br />The ending might be a let down for some, but remember: Bast is dealing with the &quot;Real World&quot;.  She doesn't have hands that shoot out blue lightning, or flashyJackie Chan-style tactics, or the Goddess physically manifesting as a shining Being at the eleventh hour.  All Bast has are brains and bit of bravery.<br />A nice, entertaining read.	2001-01-24

When I heard that Jane Austen read the novels of Fanny Burney, I had to see what could inspire the genius behind &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.<br />Burney does a wonderful job in dispelling the myth that there ever was a time called &quot;the good old days&quot;.  Immorality, bigotry, and sexual hijinks were just as prevalent then as they are now (it was just better written back then!)<br />Evelina, the pure and morally upright heroine of the piece, writes about her &quot;coming out&quot; period in London Society.  Having grown up in the pastoral seclusion of Berry Hill, Evelina must defend her virtue against a cast of characters as amoral, vapid and ridiculous as any in modern Soapland.  <br />There are raves (minus the drugs); acts of racism; narrowly averted incest (and, subsequently, a whole passel of long-lost relatives who come out of the woodwork); encounters with prostitutes; more come-ons than you could tally at a frat party; and even an indirect comment on transvestitism.  Through it all, Evelina's behavior goes from sweet refusals, moral outrage, to nearly having a fit of vapors.<br />However, she isn't completely bereft of allies.  There are Mrs. and Miss Mirvan, two gentle creatures who serve in contrast to the drunken buffoonery of the patriarch, Captain Mirvan.  Then there is Mrs. Selwyn, the epitome of all that an Eighteenth Century lady was NOT supposed to be--intelligent, wry, outspoken, and possessed of a rapier-like sense of humor.<br />  Of course, there's the hero (whom I won't mention because he makes himself pretty well known early on).<br />While the writing is not nearly as tight as Austen's, Burney does a great job in styling each piece of correspondese into a mini-vignette of Society's shallowness and vulgarity.<br />In all, a very fun little book.	2001-01-20

I wanted to know what was different about &quot;Old School Wicca&quot;.<br />This book gives a nice little history lesson on what life was like for a British Witch in the 1950's and 1960's.  Valiente gives personal accounts of such now legendary figures as Gerald Gardner, Alex Sanders, Robert Cochrane, Janet and Stewart Farrar, and even Aleister Crowley.  She illustrates just how dangerous it was to be a public Witch in Britain at the time; and the trouble they went through with both the press and the police when it came to dealing with accusations of Satanism and committing human sacrifice.  <br />Valiente also describes the hazards of intra-coven politics.  Witch wars waged in the media and psychic vampires turning up on your doorstep, hat in hand, with a big grin and a favor to ask. She pulls no punches when she talks about just how awful it can be when you are just trying to be both a helpful pagan and a decent person.   While her chapter on &quot;Feminist Witchcraft&quot; seemed a little dated to me, it still expresses some important ideals: the need for women to take charge of their own identity, the necessity for good stewardship of the environment, and finding a way to cope with the ever increasing human population.<br />Definitely not a &quot;how to&quot; manual for spell casting, this book will give readers a glimpse into the lives of some famous Witches. Some were powerful, some were fragile, a couple were downright deceitful, but they were all human.	2000-12-30

Any attempt to experiment and play with words is great; and trying to bolster women's courage and laughingly shove them into redefining themselves on their own terms--all the better!<br />But why trash men?  Daly's definition of heterosexual relationships as being instigated only by men towards women is not only incorrect but insulting.  One could almost accuse Daly of being heterophobic, and isn't bigotry supposed to be wrong?

The last time I read something that was simultaneously intelligent and for children (and was THIS BRILLIANT) was the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander(&quot;The Book of Three&quot;, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot;, etc.)--and that was around 20 years ago.  <br />Since I am one of the few humans who has yet to read about Harry Potter's adventures, I don't know how Pullman stands up to Rowling; but I am very happy that these two &quot;new&quot; authors are here to give us fresh tales of intelligent children and high fantasy.<br />Anyway, back to Pullman.  He has created a wonderfully strange world of armored polar bears, animal familiars called &quot;daemons&quot;, witches (good ones and bad) and a topography that reminds me of Jules Verne's mechanical dreamscapes-- sizzling with anbaric power and illuminated with softly glowing naphtha lamplight.<br />Timewise, Pullman's alternate reality left me happily puzzled.  One minute, I thought I was in Victorian London with dusty Scholars and linen-bedecked tea trays.  The next, there are cars and machine guns.  For once, I didn't mind the wild juxtapositions.  It just made for a richer atmosphere.  I could feel the damp of London and the knife-edged cold of the Northern European winters.<br />On characters, Pullman fills out a detailed roster of the good, the bad and the downright evil.  Lyra as the girl hero, along with her daemon, Pantalaimon, are terrific.  While she is brave, stubborn, and smart, Lyra is very far from perfect.  Her mistakes have terrible consequences, and she will be required to live the guilt.  Iorek Byrnison, the noble bear with a painful secret, is my idea of a true warrior.  Although Pullman imbues his bears with anthropomorphic intelligence, he does not make them completely human.  In fact, Iorek fights to keep his identity just like Lyra does in her fight against &quot;the Gobblers&quot;.<br />As for villians, Pullman has created the scariestkind--creatures who rarely raise their voice and can manipulate with pain.<br />Very, very good reading!	2000-12-28

As introductions go, Jennings does a very nice job of presenting Nordic-based Heathenism in this clearly written, non-inflammatory book.<br />Jennings is able to highlight the outstanding points of Norse trads and how they differ from other Pagan Paths (without falling into the trap of saying that one Path is superior or inferior to the rest).<br />For such a small volume, Jennings fills the pages with nice tidbits about the various Northern Gods, their attributes and what they can represent to the practitioner.  He includes some of his own experiences with confrontation (including how he, his wife, and a former hearth-member of theirs faced down a gang of Skinheads at an open Northern event). That is one of the things that really impressed me about this little book--Jennings' attempt to enlighten readers that Northern Heathenism does NOT equal Nazism!<br />Even better, at the end of each section Jennings gives a short list of suggestions that the seeker can undertake, in order to acclimate him/her to the Path and to judge for themselves if this is even a Path they want to follow.  The recommended reading list (also at the end of each chapter) is a plus if you are interested in finding books that deal with a specific topic--although some of the books Jennings listed are questionable, so caveat emptor.<br />All in all, this text is well worth the money.	2000-12-27

I have never read a Judith Tarr novel before; but I had read good reviews of her other works, so I was looking forward to reading an entertaining, meaty epic.<br />I was very disappointed.  <br />For one thing, there is no serious action going on until almost two hundred pages into the story.  All I kept seeing was Sarama, daughter of the Chief of the White Horse People and newly made Servant of Horse Goddess, doing little more than trotting around on her white mare and thinking about how glad she was not to be like all the other women of the tribe: veiled, submissive, and permanently shut away in their tribal tents.  <br />Once in a while, a hint would drop about Old Woman, the previous Priestes and Servant of the Mare who took the infant Sarama and trained her for succession; but there was absolutely no real information about Sarama's life with her.  Tarr could have at least devoted one chapter to Sarama's actual upbringing with Old Woman.<br />Agni, Sarama's twin brother, was more interesting.  At least Tarr took the time to develop him into a person.  Sure, he's arrogant and short-sighted and thinks that being king is the ultimate calling; but at least he DOES something.  The scenes where he captures and trains his own stallion are interesting.  When he follows his sister westward, with every intention of subduing the matriarchal culture beyond the Great Wood, Agni actually has to think outside his tribal box and consider the political and strategic ramifications of his actions.<br />Anyone who has read Sjoo or Gimbutas will find the matriarchal cities very familiar.  The women rule, the men serve, and to every query that anyone posits comes the reply: &quot;the Lady wills it&quot;.  I found that to be as annoying as any Fundementalist tract.  The gods in this book (whether it is the Lady, Horse Goddess, or Skyfather) are just as removed as they are in &quot;real life&quot;.  I read about people worshipping their respective deities and, while the women in the Western cities may have felt some temporary bliss, it seemed to me that they were just going through the motions.  There is a good scene where one of the characters relates to Agni about how the women would braid their hair to keep it out of the way.  Soon, the fashion became tradition.  That's how I viewed the spirituality in this book.  The core of faith had long since faded and now it was all just a matter of procedure.<br />Anyway, I hope to read something better of Judith Tarr in the future.	2000-11-30

Does it really matter in Whom (or What) you believe, as long as the belief is there?<br />Read and find out...	2000-11-15

This book takes an intimate look at a silk production factory; in which the working conditions are so deplorable that the overworked employees finally go on strike.  <br />What makes this book so interesting is Mishima's ability to flesh out all his characters.  He does not fall into the simplistic &quot;worker=good/boss=bad&quot; trap, Mishima enjoys creating morally ambiguous characters.  First, Komazawa-san, the company president, appears to be very hard working and inspiring to his employees.  However, as I read about the horrible working conditions within the company, I found myself rooting for Otsuki-san, the strike leader.    As Mishima continues to dig deeper into his characters' psyches, revealing their ethical blindspots, I discovered that no one is completely good or evil.  How the protesters conscript other workers to join the strike, and how Komazawa-san's deteriorating self image reveals his pitiful humanity, make for very compelling reading.<br />The use of a strike situation is a wonderful crucible in which to combine all these differing emotions, motivations, and deceptions; resulting in characters on both sides of the picket line who are forever changed (scarred?) by the whole experience.<br />You may not be able to look at silk the same way again.	2000-11-15

While I think Deitz'streatment of Ron Dillon's crafting of the oracular Head was great inits detail and humor, that was about the only thing I liked.  <br />Itwas the little things.  For instance, Deitz's treatment of Gil, one ofRon's uncles is very negligent.  Gil, we find out, has been releasedfrom prison where he did time for a rape charge.  Dion, Ron's otheruncle, makes joking references to Gil's lechery.  Since Deitz didn'tbother to come up with an excuse for Gil's incarceration (like,perhaps, he was convicted on a false charge), the reader is left toassume that Gil is in fact a perpetrator of violence towards women.When the Welches and Dillons are assembled to witness the passing of arelative, Gil's crime is not an issue and everyone happily hugshim.<br />Another thing that bothered me was Ron and Lew's criminallyinsane sister, who wants to be the new Master.  While she could havebeen a great villian, the intimate relationship that develops betweenher and Lew isn't so much gripping as nauseating.<br />...<br />Too bad.This trilogy could have been really spectacular.	2000-10-30

The author wrote about the creative process in artists so well that I came away with the feeling of being able to achieve my own goals with more confidence.  <br />The villians in the book were expertly portrayed, with enough background given to show them as being all too human in their weaknesses. Anson is very real--a psychotic bully who is led along by his own greed.  With the support of Matthew Welch, the Master of Cardalba, these two make a very sinister pair.<br />Ron Dillon, as the reluctant teenaged hero, was very believable.  His dreams were shattered along with his body; and all he really wanted to do was get on with his life in a new high school as unobtrusively as possible.  Deitz doesn't let Ron rest for very long, and proceeds to lead his protagonist through a dark maze of mental and physical pain, the discovery of an incestuous past, and a familial confrontation involving magic and violence.  Ron's weapons: the application of the Luck that is his birthright, and the development of his gift for smithing under the bizarre tutelage of the enigmatic Road Man.<br />A dark read without the cutsey fluff of other books.	2000-10-30
US	48110003	R2BJBXU4FUE5EX	0451454499	407644414	O Greenest Branch! (Book I of Water!)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	An interesting experiment	Since I liked Baudino's other books (especially &quot;Gossamer Axe&quot;), I was really looking forward to a new story.<br />Wellll...<br />This book seems to be more of a literary experiment in multiple styles than an endeavor to tell a straightforward story.  On the plus side, Baudino delivers several good pokes at organized religion (including paganism).  No one has the corner on Truth or God/dess, and I came away thinking that this was a pretty brave attempt at something new.<br />On the minus side, Baudino seems to get way too carried away with switching narrative styles and perspectives that its easy to get lost and ask, &quot;Uh, what just happened?&quot; repeatedly.<br />Interesting, but a little too convoluted.	2000-10-30

While he does succeed in developing newcomer, Brandy Wallace into a very interesting character with a fantastic goal--an artist who is going about building a castle (dubbed Brandy Hall) in Welch County that is straight out of Tolkien or Mervin Peake, Deitz seemed to struggle with providing adequate reasons as to why Brandy and Ron Dillon should build a relationship.  Sure, they were both artistic geniuses with the ability to realize their wonderful dreams; but they also had planet-sized egos and neither one of them wanted to bend.  <br />While characters like this can still be interesting and believable, in comes the improbable Van Vannister: handyman extraordinare with the almost magical ability to do everthing around Brandy Hall perfect the first time.  <br />Throw in the idea that Vannister seemed to be insane, and that he (along with Ron) wanted to engage in amorous activities with Brandy on an almost constant basis, and you come away with a scenario that's more R-rated soap opera than good fantasy.<br />Not Deitz's best work.	2000-10-30

Books	3	5	5	N	N	Equal to the first	If the reader manages to get through the first book and is still interested in the exploits of Sari, Potatoes, Beshur, and the Puritans of the Righteous States of America, then there are things to enjoy.  Sari has to deal with the idiocies of her two &quot;protectors&quot;, while the secret insanities of the Puritans and the court of the Three Kingdoms become more evident.<br />Baudino's writing is as twisty and turny as ever, with its mass of multiple narrators and styles.  For me, the sections that dealt with &quot;the author&quot; were the most entertaining because they were the some of the only things that made actual sense!<br />This series can be a real test of patience; but there are some interesting developments.	2000-10-30

Cunningham  does a nice job of presenting Wicca as a positive, pre-Christian,  Earth-centered religion, and gives a very general (sometimes generic)  overview of the Dieties, Tools, Symbols, and High Holy Days.  <br />The book  is for those who are very new to the Craft and do not have access to, or a  desire to associate with, a working coven. Cunningham's descriptions of the  primary magical tools are very brief (i.e. the athame and the bolline  together barely take up a page of text), and really only serve to merely  introduce the objects to the reader, rather than delve into the magical  properties of them.<br />The Chapter on Magic attempts to disspell the myths  of what Wiccans actually do during ceremony, that they do not cast spells  of manipulation and harm.  Cunningham also outlines a very basic prosperity  spell in order to pay his bills.  He strongly advocates the ideal of  infusing one's magic with love.  <br />Yes, it's all very &quot;white  light&quot; and rather saccharine at times, but it is an early work and  many authors have simply lifted from what Cunningham wrote about and put  their own spin on it.  This is not a book for advanced students; but, for  those who are just starting out in the Craft and are still unsure where to  look, it can serve as a useful tool.	2000-09-14

Cunningham gives  a very broad overview of what the Craft is, how many pagans view the  Goddess and the God, a little bit about the holy days.<br />While someone who  is dead set against paganism will probably not be pursuaded that witchcraft  is a positive practice by reading this book(but you never know!), it is at  least an attempt to give the Craft and pagans a bit of good PR.	2000-09-14

Oppenheimer does do a good job in letting  us see what goes on off-screen.  Great and famous people often stand upon  the shoulders of giants, and Ms. Stewart is no different in that regard  (according to Oppenheimer, she was also more than happy to stand on the  shoulders of her family and several members of her staff, too).<br />The  author really does seem to admire Stewart's drive and tenacity, while  showing us the rather sordid underside of how she acquired her fame and who  she hurt to get it.  Well, corporate abuse is nothing new; and Oppenheimer  is simply telling the story of one woman's quest for fame and fortune--and  succeeded in getting them.	2000-09-14

I read this book around 1990, and have been a Lackey fan ever since.  The  author introduced me to a world that I have always wanted to visit (since I  couldn't live there!).  I enjoyed the fact that I could neither love the  heroes nor hate the villians with impunity. No one is perfect, and everyone  has a history as to why they developed into the characters that we read  about.<br />One of the neatest places to start a character off (especially a  young one like Talia) is a school setting.  Lackey does such a wonderful  job of setting up the Collegium, along with its students and faculty, that  I could feel myself roaming its halls and looking into the classrooms.  A  nice touch of detail: how the author sets up the school library so you can  spend as much time as you need in there, but you cannot &quot;check  out&quot; any of the material, thereby allowing everyone ready access to  the books.  The &quot;bad&quot; students may be a little too typical; but  they do provide a good foil for Talia to develop into a fighter and a sharp  intellect.<br />As a character, Talia is a great example of what young  teenagers could do if only they are allowed (and encouraged) to think for  themselves.  She has to reap her mistakes along with the rewards; but at  least they are the result of her own actions and reactions.<br />Strongly  recommend for anyone with a love for high fantasy, especially young folks  looking for a hero to whom they can relate.	2000-09-14

In &quot;A Witch's Brew&quot;, Telesco gives easy to follow  instructions for making delicious alcoholic and &quot;soft&quot; drinks (I  presented a version of the &quot;Bowl of Plenty&quot; punch at a baby  shower, and had half the people come up to me for the recipe!)<br />Included  with each recipe is a little cultural blurb about either the drink or  specific ingredients, and a short list of Magical Attributes of each  beverage. There are also variations to several of the recipes, so you can  feel free to experiment.<br />If you are looking for something to present in  Circle or to celebrate a high holy day, the section on &quot;Seasonal  Brews&quot; is just the thing!	2000-09-14

The section on creating your  own Book of Shadows is extremely valuable and informative.  RavenWolf goes  into precise detail on how to build and organize your own Book, including a  large list of very specific sections that one may want to include (i.e.  &quot;Astrological Correspondences&quot;, &quot;Dowsing Research&quot;,  &quot;Ethics&quot;, &quot;Gem Research&quot;, etc...)<br />There is also a  good deal of information for the more advanced student who may wish to  become part of a larger group and/or become involved in public activities  as a pagan representative.  RavenWolf's sections on Ethics, Conflict  Resolution, and how to protect yourself from magical or psychic attack can  still be useful to a long-standing practioner of the Craft.<br />Written with  insight and a good deal of dry humor, this book is very highly recommended.	2000-09-14

The main reason I bought this was to listen to the CD attached to the back  of the book.  It's wonderful!  Aswynn's chanting of the runes is truly a  moving experience.  The most stirring thing for me was to listen to  &quot;Nithing&quot;, the only recording of a &quot;send back&quot; spell to  someone intending harm that I have ever heard.<br />As for the book, it also  is very good.  There is nowhere near enough Norse magical material  published in English that is at least attempting to be legit (I also like  Edred Thorsson's Kveldulfr Gundarsson's work, too).  She gives a good  overview of the Futhark and an interesting chapter on the Feminine  Mysteries in the Northern Traditions.<br />Recommended!	2000-09-14
