Shades of Silence is the third book I've read by Gloria Davidson Marlow, and she's getting better and better. The imagery in this book is what really struck me, quite apropos considering the storyline and psychic abilities of the heroine, Sara Jennings. There is no distinction made between the beautifully crafted wordscapes that send the reader to the romantic oceanside setting and the frighteningly vivid images of what Sara sees when she \\"reads\\" someone--both make the reader feel as though they're experiencing it along with this compassionate heroine. Paired with the heart-wrenching struggles of the traumatized eight-year-old girl who witnessed her mother's murder and the sexual tension between Sara and the man who hires her to help his daughter, Ms. Marlow's word-painting talent makes her latest thriller an emotional mosaic that satisfies on multiple levels.<br /><br />Note to author: there's plenty of room on my book shelf for more books by Gloria Davidson Marlow!	2005-10-10

I bought this book at the Historical Novel Society Conference because I'd met Eric Swedin and liked him so much. Because the author is an engaging man gifted with knowledge in such a wide range of subjects, I expected his book to be interesting, if not my usual cup of java. Instead, I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />The Killing of Greybird is a history lesson, theological study, family saga, war novel, mystery, and heartfelt love story all in one, told in words and images as beautiful as any lyrical poem I've ever read. From the evocative opening scenes to the soul-satisfying final pages, this book touched me on so many levels. The characters are such real people and so multi-layered that they quickly became friends I knew I'd miss after turning the last page--even Greybird, who dies before the book begins and I met only through his family's memories. Author Swedin doles out plot twists and revelations with sublime subtlety, then ties everything together for a stirring conclusion that leaves nothing unresolved, and he does it with insights into human nature that resonate with wisdom to rival the scriptures themselves.<br /><br />When a book can make an Alabama Baptist who grew up in the late seventies feel as if she were part of a family of Latter Day Saints in post-Civil War Utah, you know the author has written an amazing novel. Do yourself a favor and buy your own copy, then set aside some time to visit with the Halliday family of Manti, Utah.	2005-04-25

When he told me he liked it without elaborating, I assumed it was because, as I'd heard, the book featured insightful commentary on the plight of teachers in today's public schools. Interesting, but not exactly the criteria I use in choosing my own pleasure reading, so it went behind quite a few other books in my to-be-read stack.<br /><br />However, when I read Spine for myself, I whacked my husband upside the head for not telling me it's also a suspenseful page turner with compelling characters who come to life as the completely unpredictable story unfolds-exactly the kind of book I love to read. That's why I'm getting Mr. Mazur's next book for myself and it's going at the top of the stack.	2005-03-26

I'm not usually a romance reader--although there has to be romance in anything I read--but this book drew me in from the beginning with its atypical hero, Ford Colston. He's hardworking, honorable, and honest to a fault, and he believes no woman would ever want him because he's not handsome in the traditional sense and harbors inside him a \\"wild\\" passion that has always alienated him from his insensitive family and the puritanical town he lives in. When he meets Hannah of the orphaned gypsy spirit, she sees the goodness in Ford and is drawn to him despite her need to run from the hired killers chasing her because she witnessed a murder. She and Ford strike a deal that keeps them together for a month, and although they both want it to be forever, they both also think they're not worthy of the other's love. Hannah is a likable heroine, but Ford captured my heart from the first page. A touching, satisfying read I recommend highly.	2005-01-10

It takes a talented writer to make a reader feel for a serial killer preying on beautiful, vulnerable young girls, but Gloria Davidson Marlow carries it off masterfully.  The killer in this suspenseful book chooses his victims because they share a name and at least one characteristic with a species of butterfly, and he does it because of something his beloved wife said before she died: \\"I hope there are butterflies in Heaven.\\"  His grief drives him to set about inhabiting Heaven with his beautiful \\"butterfly girls,\\" and Genevieve Lewiston is the ultimate specimen: she's the stunning Butterfly Girl for Butterfly Cosmetics, and she's also the only one of his butterflies to get away.  Six years later, \\"Jenny Lewis\\" has created a safe life for herself to hide in from the madman who tried to kill her, but she can't hide from Coach Nick Jensen, the man who sees her inner beauty and refuses to give up on winning her heart. Just when Jenny decides to take a chance on love with the handsome man she can't resist, the killer tracks her down. She is forced to come out of hiding and be the bait in a trap to catch the killer before he snares more innocent girls to complete his collection.<br /><br />All the characters in The Butterfly Game are well-developed and complex, and the plot is refreshingly original.  The scenes inside the killer's head are horrifying and heartbreaking at the same time--no easy feat.  The technical information about butterflies is woven seamlessly into the narrative, and the ending is an oh-my-gosh, eye-widening surprise that leaves no loose ends.  An all-around wonderful read.	2005-01-04

Even with two daughters who are avid LOTR and Harry Potter fans, I had previously read only A Wrinkle in Time and The Wizard of Oz in the fantasy genre, so I was pleasantly surprised to find so many elements of romance, humor, and drama included among the wizards, elves and warriors in Upon the Shoulders of Vengeance: The Journey to Armageddon.<br /><br />James McCann writes in a sensory style that makes even his battle scenes literary.  His characters are complex and each have a history that begs to be told in volumes of their own, but their lives converge in this story for a climax that leaves the reader fulfilled and yet eager for more. I recommend this book to fantasy fans and anyone who enjoys a good tale.	2004-11-10

I can honestly say that Burned lived up to all my lofty expectations.  Jana Cone gives her readers just the right blend of a finely detailed factual account of the crime, investigation, and trial, combined with an intimate look at the lives and histories of all the key players in the case.  And since Ms. Cone is from Georgia herself, I didn't have to suffer through the stereotypical caricatures Southerners so often become in the hands of journalists not lucky enough to be born south of the Mason-Dixon line.  My only complaint is that I didn't like the ending, but since this is a true story, that's not the author's fault.  Jana Cone is definitely one of those authors whose next books I will eagerly await and buy as soon as they're available.	2004-09-19

I don't feel quite so guilty about all the hours I spend reading for pleasure when I learn from what I'm reading or gain insight into people with mindsets different from my own, and A Separate Beginning provided me with both.<br /><br />Lynn Price's main characters, Drs. Erik Behler and Kim Donovan, are about as far from cardboard as possible.  In fact, they're so well-developed and multifaceted that I found myself wanting to punch them at various points in the story because they wouldn't do what I wanted them to do.  They have such distinct minds of their own that I had to wonder if their actions were the author's original intent or if she had been forced to comply with the demands of her strong-willed, obstinate creations.<br /><br />I didn't like many of Erik and Kim's choices as they banged heads over the difference in their professional philosophies, and I often wanted to scream at them to open their eyes and see what they were missing out on because they were too stubborn to see all the things they had in common, but I guess that just shows how realistic they were to me.  And since their arguments were as full of sassy, witty dialogue as the rest of this entertaining novel, I couldn't help enjoying their barb-slinging sessions.<br /><br />The author's extensive research and passion for educating her readers about alternative pain management and integrative medicine make A Separate Beginning a literary documentary that resonates with emotion on every page, and I recommend it to anyone who likes books that touch them and make them laugh while expanding their mind.	2004-08-01

He's rich, good-looking, witty, and trained as a highly efficient killing machine by the Army's Special Forces.  When he's hired by beautiful doctor Brianne Richard to help find her mother's killer, he soon discovers that he needs all his training for the job.  He stumbles onto a decades-old conspiracy involving government agencies, organized crime, and Brianne's family.<br /><br />Jon and Brianne are kidnapped as a warning to drop the investigation, and they barely manage to escape with their lives.  When Brianne is hurt in the process, the case becomes personal for Jon, because he and Brianne have fallen in love.<br /><br />Richard Alan Nelson writes with a voice that manages to be witty and engaging even when writing nail-biting, violent scenes, and his storyline never drags.

Tom Elkins' journalistic background is evident in his attention to facts, but he utilizes his talent for story-weaving to provide fictional details that make for a tale that's as entertaining as it is informative and historically accurate.  Readers fight alongside North men in the Revolutionary, Civil, and Vietnam wars.  Their adventures are engrossing and make you feel as if you're watching the events play out before your eyes.  Even for a history non-enthusiast like me, this gripping book was hard to put down.<br /><br />The author also reveals his journalistic roots by his refusal to slant his portrayal of any of the characters.  He reports their flaws and mistakes right along with their accolades, leaving his readers well-equipped to form their own opinions about these sometimes too-human men, and his honesty lends credibility and pays tribute to the North family's many honors.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written docudrama and eagerly look forward to reading more by Tom Elkins.	2004-05-10

Although I've never been in an abusive relationship myself, I have always had such contempt for abusers that I couldn't even bring myself to let my female characters tolerate them in my own writing.  But after reading May's Rainbow, I can understand why sometimes it's hard to walk away from someone who beats you.<br /><br />May and Lee meet and fall in love as teenagers, and at first everything is wonderful.  They are inseparable and totally committed to each other.  The first time Lee loses his temper with May and twists her arm, he pleads with her to take him back and swears he will never hurt her again.  The next time he slaps her and punches her on the side of the head.  Each time his violence escalates, so does the desolation and appearance of sincerity in his apologies afterward.  He begs and cries and tells her how much he loves her, and although every time he hurts her I was outraged and swore I wanted her to get rid of him, I found myself wanting to believe him right along with May when he would promise it would never happen again.  And just like May, I hoped marriage and fatherhood would change him and was happy when they got married, but of course he didn't change.<br /><br />This story touched me on many levels because I felt for so many of the characters.  May is an admirable heroine who knows she doesn't deserve to be abused and that it's not her fault, she just can't walk away from the man she loves.  And Lee is not the stereotypical batterer.  When he isn't angry, he's a loving husband and father who seems to honestly try to do what's right by his family, but because of whatever inner demons he suffers from, he just can't handle responsibility for long and continues to screw up until he forces May to find the strength she needs to leave for good.<br /><br />When I read the last page of May's Rainbow, I was crying for several reasons: out of despair for Lee and his self-destructive fate, out of regret for their shattered family and their son who would probably never know his father, and with pride for May because she had regained her dignity and self-esteem and was able to save herself and the son she loves more than anything else.out of despair for Lee and his self-destructive fate, out of regret for their shattered family and their son who would probably never know his father, and with pride for May because she had regained her dignity and self-esteem and was able to save herself and the son she loves more than anything else.	2004-05-03

Intrigued?  Meet Patrick, the undead hero of Simplicity, who sentences himself to Hell for the woman he loves.  Patrick knows more about selflessness, unconditional love, charisma, and seduction than do most romantic leading men.<br /><br />When he meets Lori, Patrick is a filthy vagrant whose daily beggings are spent on food only if there's enough left after he buys his beloved bottle, and Lori is a damaged beauty who keeps trying to kill herself but never quite succeeds.  They spend what is supposed to be Lori's last night alive talking together under the bridge where Patrick lives and from which Lori jumps--right into the arms of Van Pierre, a recruiter for Hell's army.  When she returns to Patrick the next night and bids him drink from the dark man's chalice, he obeys without question because he loves her already, and they are plunged into the world of nightly bloodlust.<br /><br />As horrified as they are by what they've become, they can't deny the thrill of their new powers.  Patrick is more than willing to suffer every day while he sleeps and his soul returns to Hell to be tortured unmercifully by Pink, his personal demon, as long as he gets to be with Lori every night when he awakens.  But Lori is still haunted by her life and continues to plan her own demise even though it means she will remain in Hell forever and will be leaving Patrick--the only man who has ever really loved her--alone for eternity.<br /><br />Simplicity is like a 435-page paradox: one minute it's a gruesome peepshow of demonic torture sessions that revolted me more than Stephen King at his goriest, and the next it's a sensitive commentary on man's inhumanity to man and our deep-seated desire to be valued and loved for ourselves.  I was just as moved by Patrick's quest for Lori's love as I was repulsed by the descriptions of his visits to Hell.  I can't tell you how odd it feels to be inspired by the insights of a vampire, but Patrick's musings read like an essay on enlightenment.  The thinking person's horror story, if you will.<br /><br />And since vampires exist for eternity, I sure hope there's another journey into Patrick's world in our literary future.ell.

From the first pages of The Snakeman Cometh, I thought I had been dropped onto a wooden pew in a backwoods Kentucky church.  I felt the stifling heat and humidity, the frightening presence of The Snakeman as he commanded everyone's unwavering attention, and the terror of 10-year-old Jolene Mosley, the innocent child whose only sin was loving to read and whom the self-proclaimed prophet victimizes for his sideshow.<br /><br />Jolene is held captive by her family's devout belief in The True Believers Holiness Church, its sadistic rules and punishments, its maniacal leader, the Reverend Browning, and by her own desire to be good and worthy of the love she longs for and never gets.  Then Russell Nash, The Snakeman's orphaned nephew, comes to live with The True Believers and teaches Jolene that it's herself she must believe in.<br /><br />Allison Pollack Alexander writes with an unpretentious clarity that reads like an eyewitness account of this heartrending story.  The horror of the unrelenting cult society, the agony and betrayal Jolene feels because of her family's abandonment, and the hope that finally blooms in her colorless life thanks to Russell are all projected from the pages straight to the reader's heart.  This book will mesmerize you like The Snakeman does his followers, and you will be unable to resist its lure.	2004-04-05

Chester is irresistibly endearing, and if there is any similarity between the author and his protagonist, Allen Parker's wife gets my vote for sainthood.  But I'm sure she's also glad she has such a fun-loving, devoted husband who clearly loves her almost as much as he loves getting into trouble.<br /><br />Take a vacation from life's pressures and read Nudist Among Us.

She's a Jewish Californian with infertility problems and a husband she doesn't quite trust; I'm an Alabama Baptist with three kids and an overly devoted husband.  But since I love Nancy Rechtman's columns, I wanted to read her novel, and I'm sure glad I did.<br /><br />By the end of chapter one, I felt as if Emma and I were best friends.  I held my breath along with her each time she waited to see if she was pregnant and cried with her when she wasn't.  I agonized with her over her job woes and her father's impending marriage, laughed with her at her grandmother's cranky remarks and the fun she had with her best friend and sister-in-law.  I raged with her at her mother-in-law's insensitive button-pushing, and was seduced with her by her sexy, good-looking husband.  As Emma searched her soul and tried to find answers to her life's questions, her musings rang so true that I found myself nodding in agreement as I read, and when she longed to be able to talk to her mother about everything, I missed my own mama and mourned right along with Emma.<br /><br />When I finished My Little One, I was truly sorry to have to say goodbye to my new Jewish friend in California, but I knew she would be all right because she was loved by so many people, including me.	2004-03-17

The opening chapter of The Fire Within is like a kick in the gut and is perfect for making the reader empathize with Elysia Reeves, the daughter of a monster known as the Phoenix.  Elysia is beaten and forced to have sex with strangers to satisfy her mother's need for babies she sacrifices to fuel her immortality.  Elysia's tortured existence is encapsulated in an opening sequence that details her repeated rape by a sweating fat man her mother paid to assault her, but the real horror is symbolized by two little words she must say to her mother after each episode of cruelty: \\"Thank you.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the story isn't nearly as graphic as Elysia attempts to escape her torture with the help of Kaleb, one of the men her mother brings to rape her.  She manages to get away, but her mother is able to track her down and wreaks havoc and death on everyone Elysia comes in contact with.  Elysia and Kaleb are able to escape again and try to rebuild their lives with each other and their baby on the way, but Elysia knows her torment will never end unless she faces her mother for a final showdown.<br /><br />Kevin Yarbrough writes brutal scenes in unflinching detail, but he also portrays the closeness and the depth of feeling between Elysia and Kaleb with a sincerity that exposes him as a caring, sensitive person.  His characters are real--sometimes terrifyingly so--and his story never drags, right up to the end that sets the stage for the sequel I look forward to reading.	2004-03-15

Anyone who can plan burglaries, murders, kidnappings and counterfeiting schemes with such flawless attention to detail should be watched very carefully!<br />The book's main character, Martin Lovett, makes some very bad choices in his life and isn't always a nice guy, but he remains oddly likable throughout the story and I found myself rooting for him despite his flaws. Maybe it's because of his devotion to his wife Cindy, a fine woman who knows nothing of his criminal activities; or it could be because of the dirt-poor family Marty came from and all the hardships he had to overcome growing up. Possibly it's just that the lowlifes he gets mixed up with make him look like an Eagle Scout in comparison, but I know I couldn't help feeling that Marty was really a decent guy and wanted a happy ending for him.<br />Concept of Justice unfolds one subtle layer at a time and culminates in a resolution that is both surprising and completely credible, thanks to some tenacious law enforcement officers who add even more human flavor to this intriguing story. The author's extensive knowledge and expertise in a variety of professions is impressive and make for a book that has no loopholes or slips in logic that annoy me to no end. This crime thriller will keep you up late turning pages to find out how the deliciously complex plot turns out, but you definitely won't regret missing a little sleep for this book.	2004-03-08

It wasn't enough for him to craft this epic Civil War novel with the skill of a master storyteller or for him to move and enlighten his readers with the multitude of rich historical content he injected into this saga.  No, he ruthlessly makes his defenseless readers feel as if they are witnessing first-hand the brutality of war, imprisonment, massacres, and the cruelty that dwells in the hearts of evil men.<br /><br />And yet, amidst all the blood and gore and horrors of battle, he manages to introduce us to characters who love and care for each other so deeply that it sustains them throughout their lives.  It's amazing that the same book that contains scenes that horrify and repulse can also contain scenes that abound with tender emotions, sensitivity and an appreciation of life's true pleasures and the beauty to be found all around us.<br /><br />The main characters of Mace, Tom, George, and Louie are the embodiment of the spirit that made the American West wild, but there is nothing typical about any of them.  They have other dimensions that are wonderfully illustrated in their relationships with each other, with the men they meet and respect, and with the women they love.  We rage with them, laugh with them, suffer, cry and love with them as they travel over the untamed landscapes of their lives.  Mr. Boren even makes us feel for the vile, despicable character of Chactoke--a renegade Apache who is almost evil incarnate.  We hate him fiercely for the horrific things he does, but we know that even he has suffered in his past and can't help feeling for him at times.<br /><br />This is not a feel-good book to curl up with and savor--it's too real for that.  But when you finish reading it, you will have gained a better understanding of just how much our forefathers endured for us.  Sometimes, ruthlessness is a good thing.	2004-02-16

When I finished reading Hum of Hushed Voices, I emailed Lisa Young and called her a dirty rat for introducing me to her characters, teasing me with so many juicy tidbits about the complexities of their pasts, and then ending the book without telling me everything that happens to all of them.  Even the peripheral characters in this book are intriguing!  I may have to go visit the author and clean house for her so she'll have more time to work on her sequels!<br /><br />Hum of Hushed Voices investigates the murder-made-to-look-like-suicide of a popular doctor at a mental health center.  The three main characters are rookie officer Darby Jacobs, involved in the case only because--unknown to everyone--the dead doctor was her therapist years ago; Detective Justin Weissman, whose investigation is hampered by his attraction to Darby that's hampered by his annoying ethics; and Detective Sergeant Don Salington, their arrogant superior who taunts Darby with secrets of their shared past but can't get her memory out of his head no matter how many other women he's with.  Amidst all these delicious undertones, they manage to gather evidence from the &quot;Peyton Place&quot; of the victim's family and co-workers, and when they finally decide who the killer is, it puts all three of them in danger.<br /><br />Ms. Young's writing style and attention to detail grab you from the beginning and smack you down right in the middle of the characters' lives.  Her ability to seamlessly insert descriptions of the characters and all their nuances into the action is done so flawlessly that I had vivid mental images of them instantly.  You don't just read the story, you live it right along with the characters.  The plot is wonderfully complex and keeps the old gray matter earning its pay as you try to figure out if you're on the right track to whodunit or if you've been expertly suckered by one of the author's innovative deceptions.  This is a book that will trigger varied emotions and reactions--anger, sympathy, fondness, disgust, tears, and laughter--and don't forget outrage and impatience at Ms. Young's failure to have the sequel written yet.<br /><br />So tell everyone you know to buy and read this book so the author can quit her other job and write full time.

Under the Melting Pot is not only a poetry collection filled with beautifully melodic verse, it's an epic love story told in words so touching and emotional that it's as if the reader is watching the story unfold through the tearful eyes of one of the lovers.  We feel the author's pain, joy, anger, and elation as he fights for the most important thing in his life--the woman he loves and his right to be with her.  Even as we rage with him over the injustice he must suffer in his quest, he shows us the true measure of the man he is by making us feel for those who treat him so cruelly.<br />I began reading the first few poems and became so drawn into the life of the author that I was terrified the b! ook would end without my knowing how his journey ended, but I should have known that anyone who writes with as much feeling as Tyrone Vincent Banks would never do that to his readers.  I read the entire book in one sitting and was sad when I came to the end, but only because it felt as if I was having to say goodbye to new friends I'd come to know and love.  I can't wait to read the next installment in this story of a love so strong that no amount of prejudice could defeat it.	2004-01-19

Everything seems real as you walk with the heroine amongst the opulence of Versailles and fall in love with her for the first time as she rides a black mare across the French countryside with her dashing beloved.<br />Seamlessly woven into the delightful love story is a historical tale of religious persecution and royal politics, with an underlying, deeply moving testament of faith throughout the entire book that leaves the reader with a sense of peace from the certainty of God's love.<br />I'm so glad this is Book One of a series, because I can't wait to read more of this captivating saga.	2003-11-15
US	41538782	R20GOI1HH9DRKM	1588511391	976609202	Puddles	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Simple Pleasures	Remember the simple joy of childhood pleasures like finding images in clouds and jumping in puddles? That's where Lynn Barry got the title for &quot;Puddles&quot; and it's the feeling you get as you read it. Although the characters are facing some pretty big problems, the story has such an underlying sense of faith and appreciation for the little things in life that are really important, you can't help feeling uplifted as you read.<br />The plot is compelling and uncluttered with flowery prose that gets in the way of the action, and all the subplots come together for a satisfying ending. The characters are realistic and so varied that readers of all ages and genders should relate to at least one of them and empathize with the others.<br />This is a book that reminds us to laugh at ourselves and enjoy those occasions when we're so busy living we walk right into one of life's puddles.	2003-10-12

The character of Austin is likable and evokes empathy in the reader, even when he does things he doesn't understand himself. While Heather at first seems to be the stereotypical spoiled princess, she reveals deeper levels of her character as the story progresses. This is a book that should definitely leave teen readers with a feeling of hope.	2003-10-10

That's how deeply the characters and the story draw you in to the world of Dunn Berry, Mississippi. Meet Billy Rose Marsh--better known to Dunn Berry as \\"The Kid\\"--a 16-year-old girl whose talent is rivaled only by her beauty and spirit. Her life has been a series of performances intended to prepare her for real stardom, until Kenner Golden drives into her life in a brand new Cadillac. Neither of them expects to fall in love--they barely even like each other at the start--but a blind date on Halloween night in 1955 proves to be the beginning of a journey for both of them that changes their lives and the lives of everyone they love as well. Along the way, some long-buried secrets are unearthed, hearts are broken and mended, tragedy strikes without regard to bank accounts or social status, and more than a few miracles are witnessed. Like a visit with the kinfolks, this book will make you laugh, cry, cuss, and cheer, but it will also leave you feeling heartened and at peace, as if you'd just spent a balmy Southern evening holding hands with your sweetheart on your mama's front porch.	2003-10-09

The author's heart is so clearly laid open that I couldn't help but admire her fearless spirit. The beauty of the words at times is so real you feel compelled to close your eyes and envision the picture they sketch. This is truly a collection that will nurture every soul.	2003-09-29

That initial meeting of the eyes and the hands, the exhilaration felt every time you glimpse your beloved, agonizing over every word uttered by either of you, and the unforgettable thrill of that first kiss.  When you read &quot;Pinky,&quot; you experience it all through the eyes of 16-year-old Vincent Bezdek, a hero as endearing as any to ever capture my heart.<br /><br />A transplanted Nebraskan farm boy, Vince quickly becomes enamored with Ventura, California, and almost as quickly falls in love with the beautiful girl next door who appears to be too busy with painting and ballet to even notice him--or so he thinks.  He focuses his attention on his other love: hot rods--specifically, the 1940 Ford coupe he plans to customize, but when the summer ends, Vince discovers he must never assume anything about this girl called Pinky.  The morning of the first day of school, she gets into Vince's coupe as if he should have known all along she would do so, and so begins the natural progression of their relationship and the role the little '40 coupe plays in it all.<br /><br />Vince and Pinky's love is sweet and innocent, but it's also deep and complex.  Because he is so much in awe of Pinky's talent and unpredictable nature, Vince doesn't seem to realize how special he is himself and how much Pinky loves him in return.  Pinky is not only talented and smart, she is also fearless and passionate and does her best to help Vince believe they are meant to be.  They have their share of misunderstandings and hardships, but their mutual respect and depth of character carries them over the hurdles with only a few stumbles--until high school ends and the adult world rears its demanding head to make them both make the hardest decisions of their lives.<br /><br />This coming-of-age story made me laugh out loud and shed tears of heartbreak and joy, and I came to think of the characters as members of my own family.  The book is 536 pages and I was still sorry to reach the end, because the story is told in the author's engaging voice that reads like a conversation with a close friend.  Although I didn't understand some of the technical details about building a hot rod, they were woven into the story so naturally they seemed only more proof of Vince's love for Pinky, because anyone who knows cars so intimately and would still give them up in a heartbeat for a girl has most surely found true love.<br /><br />&quot;Pinky&quot; is a book that will leave you feeling you've just taken a drive along the Ventura coastline, shared the beauty of an ocean sunset with someone special, and fallen in love for the first time.  You'll finish it feeling wistful over the story's end, but you'll also feel as if you've gained some new friends you'll never forget.s still sorry to reach the end, because the story is told in the author's engaging voice that reads like a conversation with a close friend.

All he knows is that his body and mind are being overpowered by some force that is too strong to be resisted, and his health is failing as a result of the constant abuse. In his search for help, he meets Dr. Michaele Vincente--Mickey to her friends--and finds an experienced psychiatrist who is not only his best chance for uncovering his problem, but also a beautiful woman who is his best chance for finding real love.<br />Perry and Mickey struggle to expose the evil that is trying to destroy him: Lillia Donovan--an ambitious, calculating woman determined to possess Perry's fortune, business, and his body. Lillia learned about evil firsthand in her past and uses her hatred of men to show Perry and anyone who dares to help him not a shred of mercy.<br />Until Next Time invokes such a wide array of emotions with the intensely sexual images of Lillia's power over Perry, the deep feelings between Perry and Mickey from their first encounter, and the loving relationships between Perry and his closest friends and family members. These are all people about whom the reader cares and empathizes--even Lillia with her history of abuse that drove her to become the monster she is.<br />My eyes couldn't move fast enough to suit me as I read the final pages to see who would triumph in this unforgettable battle for one man's soul. Ms. Alexander spins an enthralling tale that delivers on every level. Bravo!	2003-07-29

Aston is such an engaging guy who keeps getting heroism dropped into his lap no matter how hard he tries to avoid it, and although he does his best to convince us that he's a cad, his true character shows through in everything he does.<br />Who Needs A Hero is a fast-paced trip into Aston's world of space in the future that is sure to make the heart of any fan of Star Trek or Star Wars beat with joy.  The plot is easy to follow without being simplistic or predictable, and the author's attention to detail puts the reader right in the middle of the action.  I just hope Mr. Hunter gets the sequel done in hyperspeed.	2003-07-05

US	41538782	RK0SVIF5E8GCY	0451190904	786571932	Survivor	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Lingering emotions	As is the case with many of Ms. King's novels, I found myself drawn more to her male characters than the females. Junior Clootie is hard to love, but he grew on me just like he did the story's heroine, Kissy Mellors. Their intensely sexual relationship is volatile and frustrating, but no matter how mad I got at both of them, I ached for them to be together where they belonged. When an author can make you laugh, cry, and get so mad you throw the book across the room, you don't forget the characters when you close the book, and that's the way it was for me with Junior and Kissy.	2003-05-24

You travel with them on their journey back from the nightmare of 9/11, feeling all the anguish, disheartenment and finally, the joy they experience as they fight to put their lives back together, and you close the book with a sense of triumph and the feeling that your own hope has been restored as well.	2003-04-16

They are multi-dimensional people who will make you alternately want to hug them, yell at them, cheer for them or slap them, but you always care. ONE ON ONE was the first Tabitha King novel I read, then I subsequently purchased all her books and discovered that ONE ON ONE is the third book to feature Sam and his family, and I also loved THE BOOK OF RUEBEN and PEARL. I've been a Stephen King fan for years, so now my bookshelves are filled with even more King books!	2003-02-20
