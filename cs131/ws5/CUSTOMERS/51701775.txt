The story is very readable and comfortable, language is easy for young kids, the story develops a pattern that is recognizable and funny.  This book teaches the concepts of causation, that is, one thing leads to another, and connectivity between events.  At the end, blameworthiness is discarded with a show of empathy for the main character and a comforting activity. <br />Excellent book.	2003-07-16

This book has seven bedtime stories set up on two pages each.  Each page spread is one story, somewhere between 16 and 20 lines of text. That's it, not much of a story.  The rhymes are cute, but in two of the stories the rhyme seems very forced.  The pictures, as always, are great. But the &quot;stories&quot; are more like nursery rhymes, an alternative to Mother Goose.  <br />What do we like about it?  The tab system that lets my child count as we go through the book. She also recognized a couple of characters from the Going to Bed Book, which I think is a better bedtime Boynton book, in the pajamas page.<br />I think if you've been reading more substantial story books, like Seuss or Sendak, or other classics, this is probably too elementary, unless you are still doing short books at night.  Based on the reviews, I thought this was a sure hit; but I didn't realize what the actual content would be.	2001-02-05

Illustrations are not PC.<br />Ping and his extended family live on a boat on the river.  They go out each day, and come back, and the last duck gets a swat on the back, so don't be late -- don't be last.  Ping, seeing that he will be last and hence swatted, stays out overnight.  He's caught by a family that wants a duck dinner, but the young boy of the family lets him go.  The next day, Ping happily takes the swat as he runs up the gangway to his own boat.  He'll take that swat 'cause there's no place like home.<br />I think children understand why Ping stays out all night, to avoid that swat, and they also understand why he chooses to take that swat the next day, to be back home.  There is a horrible point when Ping is going to be dinner, and is trapped in a basket, but after a couple of reads, that page spread is not so scary.<br />This is a classic tale. I remember it from my childhood and my daughter loves this as a bedtime story.	2001-01-21
US	51701775	R3EPSDGO9BUFOP	0805006621	785995400	Tikki Tikki Tembo	Books	5	3	6	N	N	A sound-byte for your toddler	I first read this book in the 80s when I was babysitting.  I gladly bought it for my child, primarily for the name rhyme . This book is not politically correct by our standards (it portrays some asian stereotypes; I'm no scholar, they might be historically accurate). Still, it tells an interesting, and different story.  I find the illustrations remarkably good considering the genre (a faux chinese woodcut style?) and certainly different.  <br />The story is as follows:  two little boys, the older with the long name, and the younger with the short name, play near the well.  The younger falls into the well, the older runs for help.  Later, the older falls into the well, but the younger, seeking help, cannot get the older boy's name out to communicate the problem, as the name is soooooo long.  Everyone lives.  From there after, children were given short names.<br />Children like this book because of the boy's long, lyrical name.  They love to say the name in rhyme -- but it seems to be a sound-byte, the rest of the story disappears.  The illustrations are much different from many other books, and this is a good book to have on the shelf because it is so different in voice and illustrations.	2001-01-21

The pictures are stills from the television show.  In this volume, Po has a watering can which he sprinkles  on items (ball, hat, bag) to make them &quot;enormous.&quot;  The flaps are  large enough for little hands and sturdy.  The story is: Po makes the items  enormous and the teletubbies love their enormous items and each other, the  end.  Very small kids seem to like repetitous books, and this one isn't too  expensive and at least the flaps will last.  While the educational content  of this whole series is questionable, children really seem to love these  characters.	2000-08-20

I just found this book in a box of my old books.  My daughter was fascinated!  In addition to teaching the ideas behind getting dressed, and  counting really high, the illustrations (a little reminiscent of some New  Yorker cartoons) are delightful.  This is a terrific book for about 2-15,  and of course, for adults.	2000-08-11

This is a popular gift choice (there is a nice gift set   -- book and stuffed bunny).  Just remember -- its everyone else's gift  choice, too.  Another great gift book by this author is The Runaway  Bunny.<br />Of course, if you get a non-board book version, chances are that  the extra copies will come in handy, as pages can tear easily.

This is a wonderful story, in question and answer format, of a young one and its mother heading home. As they go, Baby wonders if Mother would still  take care of it if it was something else -- animate or inanimate.  A number  of possibilities are ventured, and Mother answers, as mothers do, that she  will be there in some perfect way to take care of Baby.  The illustrations  are warm and cozy and this is a terrific read.  This book deserves much  more attention than it has apparently received, as it communicates a  message that is very comforting to young children.<br />This book also makes a  terrific present.	2000-08-11

Each page contains a collection of drawings that illustrate the  definition of something.  The illustrations tend to show the early Sendak  style, but in this book, there is essentially no overwhelming background --  each boy or girl or dog is illustrated in black and white (or beige).  Each  picture is self-contained, but there is some flow to the text on certain  pages.  <br />It's difficult to describe this book, but there is really a  separate level for adults in these definitions that makes this an enjoyable  read for parent and child.  For the adult, this book evokes the simplest  play of childhood and a return to certain basic principles that were  probably totally accepted and later forgotten.  I don't know why, but this  is an overlooked classic.  I can't think of another book like this.	2000-08-11

The animals  have a square dance, replete with rhyme.  The illustrations, as always, are  realistic enough yet still imaginative. Like many things in life, even for  young ones, sometimes its fascinating, and sometimes not.  My daughter  loves this book when Granny reads it to her, and sometimes she pages  through it herself, telling whoever is about what the animals are doing.   After a few months, however, she began to pass it by in favor of other  choices.  She prefers the Going To Bed Book, also by Boynton.  Still, I  think this is a cute rhyme, and many kids will like it.  If they've ever  been to a real square dance, this would probably be a welcome read.	2000-08-11

There are a lot of cute counting  books out there, but this one has a twist no one else has picked up.  The  story line is nonsensical enough to hold interest for a long time.	2000-08-11

One and all, big and small, this boatload of animals  undertakes a bedtime routine.  They  wash up, put on pajamas, brush their  teeth and get ready for bed.  Although some parts require a limited  suspension of logic (as adults, we would never exercise in our pajamas on  deck, under the moon, immediately before retreating to the bedchamber), the  flow is rythmic and relaxing.  The biggest problem is that, like all  Boynton books, it is so short that you will read it again and again and  again.  Still, it is not so annoying that you will mind.	2000-08-11

After she figures out that we don't  have those big tails, she's done with this.  The pictures are cute, the  rhyme scheme works, but its hit or miss.  <br />This author has a lot of  different books that appeal to a lot of different kids, so if this doesn't  sound like something new or right for you, keep looking -- there's probably  a perfect Boynton book for your child.	2000-08-11

The board books have about 8-10 pages.  The story is told with words and pictures.  Max,  and his sister Ruby (who is the caretaker) are quite adorable themselves.   They have fun even while doing chores - taking baths, going to sleep.   These books are easy enough that kids feel they are &quot;reading&quot;  them quickly.  They can also identify with the activities in the books.   <br />In this one, Max takes a bath, with grape juice and sherbet joining him  as &quot;boats.&quot;  Eventually a second bath is required, and finally,  it's Ruby who needs a bath! <br />For a kid named Max, a few of these are a  terrific gift (after all, he'll get a ton of Sendaks).	2000-08-11

The flaps are big and easy for small hands to manipulate.  The story is as  simple as the show -- each tubby makes a mess, and the noo-noo (a vacuum  cleaner with eyes) tidies up.  There are only six or so page spreads.  At  the end, there is a center page pop up of the tubbies, affixed very poorly  with a tiny bit of glue.  Still, I think all children love these characters  and the flaps will stay put.	2000-08-01

Still, my child loves it.  True, she  usually thinks the potty depicted here is a cup, and says yes to the  question of whether it is a vase to hold flowers every time, but she gets  the picture (how could she not, the illustrations are that obvious). The  illustrations are only good in the sense that the more realistic books do  not adequately portray missing the potty.  But, the illustrations reflect a  terrible era. Think muu-muus, the stylized dove, 2-d everything, shades of  orange, pink and avocado.  I really don't like reading this -- the words  are stilted, the colors are horrifying, but it seems to work (or such is  the consensus among mothers I know).	2000-08-01

E.g., &quot;mark tries all the potties before  picking the one he likes best&quot;, &quot;laura teaches the bear how to  use the potty&quot;, etc.  There is no story; each picture and usage is  different although several overlap.
