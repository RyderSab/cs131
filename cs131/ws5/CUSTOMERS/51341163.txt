It also has names of important Christian figures and a list of non-biblical popular names with appropriate scripture refernces.  It's  interesting for finding out more about a name and is easy to skim through  for inspiration for a name with meaning for your baby.	2000-04-07

It's useful, but very brief.  If you're looking for a quick prep for Sunday service, this is  it, but if you want more depth, this is not the place to find it.	2000-04-05

It reads like much of her fiction,  engaging rather than didactic. She does take some unusual approaches to the  stories in Genesis, some of which I found a little disturbing, but  basically I loved this book, and have reread it many times.	2000-04-05

This quiz book contains tons of trivia about every book of the Bible, with explinations of every answer.  It also has great background information on the various books.  However, it's very hard to look up the answers, if you,  like me, are too lazy to write your answers down and want to know the  answer as soon as you read the question.  The answers are listed by chapter  number, not by chapter subject. I was constantly losing my place and  forgetting what number chapter I was on. Still, it was very interesting and  a lot of fun.	2000-04-05

It has interesting background informaton on each of the dioceses listed, including things like population, number of Anglicans and Christians in the country, and basic  maps of where every diocese is located.  It also has a brief request from  each bishop of an intention to pray for for each diocese.	2000-04-05

It has a lot of helpful information, but it's also somewhat boring. However, it is written for the general population and does not read like a textbook. The  author suggests reading it with a bible at hand, and that is helpful. I'd  recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a lot about how to really read  scripture in depth.	2000-04-05

It covers everything from architecture and furnishings to people and robes and even traditional  movements (like genuflecting). For each entry there is a description of  what it is, when it is used, and the background of how it came to be part  of the service.  Each entry was originally written as a bulletin insert,  and they can be reproduced that way for use in churches.  Very interesting  and helpful.	2000-04-05

It takes the reader step-by-step through the resons for believing in God, with a definite Anglican point of  view, but does not do a great job of pointing out how Anglicans differ from  other Christians. Still, it was interesting and helpful even for someone  who already knew a fair amount about the episcopal Church.	2000-04-05

This book  has interesting and thought-provoking meditations on how the lives of each  of the Episcopal saints (many of whom are also Catholic saints) relate to  life in the modern world.  Some of them seem somewhat far-fetched, and the  author's politics come through occassionally, but for the most part, this  is a wonderful book.	2000-04-05

It takes you step by step through the Episcopal Church's Eucharist service, explaning what we do when and why we do it. There are simple illustrations  summarizing each concept that are good for younger kids. This book would be  useful for Roman Catholics, too (and maybe any other church with a set form  for the Communion service) because almost all of the service is the same,  if in a different order, or with different wording.  Another book on the  subject of kids in church (which applies to any denomination) is Parenting  in the Pew by Robbie Castleman, which covers lots of things, including how  to make the service more meaningful for your kids. One other book I really  like is Talking to Your Children About God by Rick Osbourne, which is aimed  more at discussing religion, rather than going to church, but it's very  helpful, too.	2000-04-05

It includes lots of details on typical symptoms  in both children and adults and lots of first hand accounts from parents  and individuals with autism. I found parts of it extemely helpful and parts  way over my head.  Worth checking the library for first, though, given the  price.	2000-03-08

It does not have much detail on the cities, only the major roads.  It's also not much use for  looking up country addresses, unless you happen to know the road number,  rather than the name.  The gazetter is great, however. It lists all the  private campgrounds in the state, amusements, excursions, spectator sports,  some stuff on the Amish, some wineries, unique natural features, all the  state parks and forests, botanical gardens, senic drives, skiing, some  canoeing, some hiking, some covered bridges, some bike routes, tons of  museums and historic sites, tons of golf corses, lots of fishing, and  lots  of hunting sites.

There are a few minor errors, but the biggest problem is that there are very few names of  roads. It makes it hard to tell if you're on the right road and useless for  trying to look up an address.  Unlike other DeLorme atlases, this one has  close up maps of the major metropolitan areas with almost all the streets,  again lacking a few names. The Gazetter part is great. It has recreation  areas, some canoe trips, tons of historic sights, unique natural features,  some scenic drives, Atlantic City casinos, some golf courses, attractions,  sking, lots of wildlife viewing plases, hiking trailshunting, fishing, and  all the private campgrounds in the state.	2000-01-08

It does not have any detail in cities and large towns, just the main streets.  But it has a great guide to  things to do:  parks and forests, some hiking trails, all the private  campgrounds in the state, some bike routes, some canoe trips, lots of info  on places to fish and hunt, tons of historic sites and museums of all  kinds, civil war sites, gardens, wildlife viewing areas, unique natural  features, some wineries, a few waterfalls, several senic drives, and even  boat trips. A great guide for exploring the state, though you will need a  regular highway map as well.	2000-01-08

It has the names and route numbers of every single road in the entire state, even dirt roads, even indicates which is which.  It is not very  helpful for roads in cities or large towns, showing only the main ones.   But in addition to that it lists canoe trips, state parks, every single  private campground in the state, tons of hiking trails (in detail),  national forests, snowmobile trails, downhill and cross-country skiing  centers, some biking trails, fishing spots (in great detail), museums,  historic sites, natural features, the arts, golf courses, covered bridges.  Absolutely essential for exploring New Hampshire.	2000-01-08

It's evening prayer based on the Catholic or Episcopalian service, but designed to be read by one or a few lay people.  It has a different version of the service for each night of the week, with  the whole service in order, which minimizes page-turning.  Then there are a  few variations in the back for the different liturgical seasons, a few  extra multi-purpose prayers and room to write in your own stuff. But that  makes it sound much more boring than it is.  The whole service has been  re-written in modern, very inclusive language. There is not a &quot;Father  Son and Holy Spirit&quot; in the whole thing, but the great part is that I  didn't even realize it until I was half-way through the service.  Unlike a  lot of inclusive languge versions, this one is not at all awkward.  It's  poetic, with tons of poetic images for God.  There are some difficult  images (God as a snow leopard?) which the author acknowledges in the intro.  But it's wonderfully joyful, slightly humorous, and a great ending for my  day. I look forward to it nightly.	2000-01-06

It tells you what birds you are likely to see there and where the best places (and best times) are. It has lots of  detail on rare birds.  There is also a great section in the back that goes  species by species and tells you where you are most likely to see them and  how common they are in New Jersey.  You still need a good field guide, but  this is a great book for actually finding the birds in the area.	1999-11-06

It also includes good pictures, brief descriptions of each species,  range and habitat and lots of interesting comments. Great for finding out  what might be in a given area, not as good for identifying a specific  sample.  Still, I really enjoyed it.	1999-11-06

If you're really interested in canoeng in New Jersey  get Edward Gertler's Garden State Canoeing-it's fantastic and covers  details about every conoeable stream in the state.

It's brief  enough that you can realistically skim through and consider all the main  names listed and come up with a list of your favorites.
