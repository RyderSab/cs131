Eddie Rake's methods were questionable, and his players won games mostly out of fear. In 34 years as coach, he led the Messina Spartans to 418 wins, 62 losses, 13 state titles, and from 1964 to 1970 an undefeated streak that ended at 84. His players loved him and hated him, and as he lay dying of cancer they gathered at the bleachers to mourn, relive their glory days, swap stories that got bigger with time, and reveal long-kept secrets.<br /><br />Among those players was Neely Crenshaw, the greatest quarterback to ever play for the Messina Spartans. The town had high hopes he'd make it to the NFL, but a career-ending injury in college football shattered his knee and his dreams. He swore he would never return to Messina, he didn't want to be reminded of what a hero he had once been. Sometimes he wished he had never picked up a football. A player becomes a hero in a town where he can do no wrong. Then one day the last game is played, another year of players roll in, and he's forgotten.<br /><br />Neely hated coach Eddie Rake for many different reasons, but never more than the night he played with a broken wrist and broken nose. He proved something to Eddie Rake that night, and as the reader I was never more proud of him.<br /><br />As the story progresses, Neely learns that people change. They mellow with age, and are truly sorry for the pain they've caused others, and there is always more to a person than meets the eye. Neely was reminded of the many times life kicked him around, and when he was on the verge of giving up, he would hear Coach Rake's voice in his head, urging him to pick himself up, do better, and never ever quit. Life is about getting past painful memories, and recapturing the good times.<br /><br />Bleachers is a touching story with characters so believable you'll swear you've watched them play on a football field somewhere. Don't be surprised if you shed a tear for Eddie Rake. I did and I hated the man. You don't need to be a football fan to enjoy this book or to relate to it. It's about broken dreams, fading stars, learning to forgive and letting go of the hurt. John Grisham tugs at your heart with unforgettable characters that will linger in your thoughts long after they leave the playing field.ry with characters so believable you'll swear you've watched them play on a football field somewhere.

After some confusion about who Sam was in the beginning, \\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer\\" drew me in and I didn't stop reading until I had finished the book. Such tender wording brought tears to my eyes and there were many laugh-out-loud moments...the kind of moments an ordinary person can relate to.<br /><br />Sam had fallen at her home and was in the ICU at the hospital. Sam and Jennifer have always been close and best friends ever since Jennifer was a little girl and spent summers at Lake Geneva with Sam and Charles, her grandparents. Charles had died long ago, and now Sam lay in a coma and the doctors weren't sure she would come out of it. Jennifer had already lost her soul mate, Danny, in an accident and didn't think she could stand to lose her grandmother so soon afterwards.<br /><br />Sam had left Jennifer a series of letters telling about her life and the secrets she kept. The first letter ended with \\"The Truth is...I never really loved Charles.\\"<br /><br />One morning Jennifer is awakened by a war-whoop and to the sight of a naked man racing toward the lake to jump off the dock and into the freezing lake water. His name was Brendan Keller, and she would love him, and he had a secret too.<br /><br />Between Sam's letters and Brendan, Jennifer learns to live from the crack of dawn until she can't keep her eyes open any longer. She learns that if you're going to look back on something and laugh about it, you might as well laugh about it now. She learns happy endings are hard to come by and that we are our stories - make them happy ones. Most of all...be alive every moment of the day.	2005-08-16

When the bad weather of Hurricane Ivan tore through western North Carolina, leaving us without power for three days in a row, I picked up a copy of \\"The Rocky Road to Romance\\" in between shopping for eatable things that would last longer than five minutes in a fridge-turned-sauna. I didn't think I would like anything outside of Stephanie Plum by Janet Evanovich. Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />Daisy Adams has a five-minute slot on WZZZ every Monday morning where she tells dog stories and gives directions on how to make homemade dog biscuits and other canine treats. When she's not doing that, she's giving colorful traffic reports and bouncing drug dealers off the fender of the WZZZ traffic car.<br /><br />Wickedly handsome Steve Crow had reservations about hiring Daisy as the temporary traffic reporter. She bakes dog biscuits for a living, for goodness sake! But until the original guy recuperates from a broken leg, he's stuck with her because no one else will take the job. It's not long until he finds himself sleeping outside her house at two in the morning, getting a dog, and buying a big house complete with a backyard bar-b-que. Now all he has to do is keep her safe from nutty drug dealers long enough to convince her to marry him.<br /><br />\\"The Rocky Road to Romance\\" is filled with all the quirky characters you've come to expect from Ms. Evanovich, including a gun-toting granny, a slobbering dog, and a teenage boy with a bottomless pit for a stomach. Daisy Adams is an adorable, feisty heroine that I truly liked and rooted for. Steve Crow is the perfect hero...macho protective, realistic, and comfortable to be with. This reader fell in love with him.<br /><br />Ms. Evanovich was right when she said, \\"Romance novels are birthday cake and life is often peanut butter and jelly. I think everyone should have lots of delicious romance novels lying around for those times when the peanut butter of life gets stuck to the roof of your mouth.\\"<br /><br />So the next time your life resembles a giant peanut butter and jelly sandwich, pick up a copy of The Rocky Road to Romance and see if it doesn't make you laugh out loud and feel tons better.xt time your life resembles a giant peanut butter and jelly sandwich, pick up a copy of The Rocky Road to Romance and see if it doesn't make you laugh out loud and feel tons better.	2005-08-16

As I was reading \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", I didn't expect the ending to make me cry. But, here I am, rolling toilet paper (since I am out of Kleenexes) off a roll, sniffling and blowing my nose.<br /><br />Eddie is the maintenance man at the Ruby Pier Amusement Park. He's spent nearly his whole life making sure the park rides are safe for children and adults. Yet, he feels he's accomplished nothing with his life. In fact, his life is painfully ordinary and I, as the reader, can relate all too well. Each day to Eddie is the same old same old until one day he wakes up and can't tell Tuesday from Thursday. Ugh! I think this happened to me last week!<br /><br />On the last day of his life, he's killed by a falling cart while trying to save a little girl from being crushed beneath it. When he awakens from death, he meets with five people whose lives he touched, no matter how fleeting, on earth. This is supposed to help him make sense of his life. It does, but what he learns is painful, even though you knew it had to happen that way in order for Eddie's life to make sense.<br /><br />Throughout the book I kept hoping my heaven wouldn't be like that, because Eddie had to relive some of the most painful moments of his life, and I didn't always feel the lessons learned were worth it.<br /><br />Initially, I didn't care for Mr. Albom's version of heaven. His is facing people from your life who in some way sacrificed something for you, bringing about feelings of guilt. Eddie didn't understand, and neither did I - at first.<br /><br />My version of heaven is sunshine, blue skies, white cotton clothes, tables and tables laden with food, mostly fruit, especially grapes, and walking in a beautiful garden of roses, daisies, and lilacs with those I loved the most on earth. It's a place where I'm happy, well fed, and loved. But this is my version of heaven, not necessarily the version of the person sitting next to me.<br /><br />What you learn in the end will surprise you as much as it does Eddie, and you'll suddenly understand that Eddie's life was more than ordinary, it was extraordinary. The people he met with, and the things he relived with them, and the lessons he took away with him suddenly make more sense than ever. I wouldn't mind this short stop on my way to blue skies and grapes, after all.<br /><br />The whole novel is great, but the ending is what makes \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" an amazing read, right up there with the classics.d will surprise you as much as it does Eddie, and you'll suddenly understand that Eddie's life was more than ordinary, it was extraordinary.

Eleven-year-old Jonas lives in a community where all decisions are made for you--your career, your spouse, and even your children. Everything is meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made. Once you begin to have wants and desires, you're required to take a pill to suppress them. There are no deep feelings, no real sense of right and wrong, and love is meaningless and useless. The Elders control everything and keep everyone happy, healthy, and ignorant, as they are themselves ignorant and must look to The Giver--the person who knows all--for wisdom.<br /><br />When Jonas reaches the age of twelve, he's assigned a career based on what he did as a volunteer. Instead of being excited, Jonas is apprehensive about the upcoming ceremony-with good reason. He's selected as The Receiver, a very honorable position, and he must meet with The Giver every day after school to receive the memories of pain, war, destruction, happiness, and love--the memories of man from way back.<br /><br />The more Jonas learns, the more outraged he becomes. He wants to make his own choices, and he believes everyone should be able to choose what color of tunic they'd like to wear each day, but The Giver quickly tells him there are more complicated choices, and it's safer to protect people from making wrong choices when they're at the age when choices become important.<br /><br />Jonas learns that, yes, there is the pain of hunger, death, war, and cruelty, but there's also the happiness of birthday parties, holidays, spring rains, blue skies and sailing, horseback riding, and hugs and laughter. He learns that everyone should be able to experience making choices.<br /><br />Even though this novel was written for teens, I truly enjoyed it from beginning to end. Several conflicting emotions surged through me as I read \\"The Giver\\"--at first it was anger that anyone could conceive of such a place, but mostly I was confused because I couldn't decide if the community Jonas lived in was truly a good thing. Part of me thought it was. People do tend to make stupid choices and mess up not only their own lives but also the lives of those around them. But the emotional side of me kept screaming, It's wrong! All wrong! Because I had the gift of wisdom, the knowledge of right and wrong, and an array of emotions, I couldn't agree with such a community. In the end I had to agree with Jonas and The Giver. No one should have the freedom of choice taken from them.<br /><br />At the end of the book, you, the reader, are left to determine what fate you think Jonas saw. Yours will probably be different from mine, depending on your optimism. I like to think...well, I wouldn't want to influence your thinking. Everyone should read \\"The Giver\\".

There he plots his revenge against Zinc by promising to give someone, calling themselves the Goth, the secret of time travel through worm holes if they will put Zinc in a stew and eat him. The Goth decides death by Vakatotoga--the torture of being eaten alive--will do nicely.

Later he transferred to the 661st M.P. Company, a National Guard unit out of Massachusetts. Normally the National Guard isn't sent into battle, but Saddam Hussein made life anything but normal in 1991. Sergeant Manchester found himself destined for Iraq, leaving behind a wife to deal with a work-related injury and financial difficulties alone.<br /><br />He arrived under the most beautiful sky he had ever seen with a little bit of fear, and a heck of a lot of courage and determination. He wasn't fighting for oil as some would have him believe, he was fighting for all the women, children, and men who had suffered under the cruel hand of a sadistic leader. Sergeant Manchester's heart was in the right place.<br /><br />The long grueling months in the hot desert took its toll. Hours turned to days, days to weeks, and weeks to months. He witnessed children blown apart by landmines, the twisted metal and burned soldiers in the aftermath of technological warfare, and senseless deaths. He dealt with a platoon sergeant who wobbled on the edge of insanity, and he was constantly sick from the inoculations and \\"preventative medicines\\" shoved upon him by the US Government. And, though the war was over, Sergeant Manchester still felt as if he were living on borrowed time and dodging the Grim Reaper.<br /><br />I felt as if I were a ghost shadowing his every step, seeing what he saw, hearing what he heard, and feeling his emotions. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, but above all else I was touched beyond measure. In the end, Sergeant Manchester sacrificed almost everything for his country and the Iraqi people. He returned home to a hero's welcome, but also to a government that shoved him out the door and left him to fight his physical and mental pain on his own. Finding peace within him proved to be a cruel battle in its own right.<br /><br />I recommend you read \\"The Unexpected Storm\\", and then you'll understand why I continue to thank Sergeant Manchester and soldiers like him with every breath I take.aqi people.

Burke Parker is found dead in a hotel room, and at first it appears he mixed too much booze with his medicine and ended up killing himself. But then the coroner finds paraquat, a deadly herbicide, in his body, on the alcohol bottles, and in his food, leading the police to believe he was murdered.<br /><br />Tom Casey, also known as Hawkman, is called in to help the local police. Three suspects are at the top of Hawkman's list.<br /><br />Lilly Parker, Burke's wife, endured years of spousal abuse at the hands of her husband, but since she didn't believe in ending a marriage, she hung in there even though she was having an affair with a local Native American. Finally she got tired of Burke's abuse and kicked him out, but he still came back demanding she leave him the leftover bottles of alcohol she was allowed to take home from work at the bar out on the porch along with a bag of food, especially fried chicken, or Burke would break in and beat her. Perhaps Lilly decided to get rid of Burke for good.<br /><br />Maryann Parker, Burke's daughter, who looks suspiciously Native American, has made it no secret she hates Burke. She once shot him in the leg and threatened to shoot him again at another time if he didn't leave her mother alone. Maybe she decided to choose another way to do away with her father.<br /><br />Madukarahat or Maduk for short, a Native American of the Shasta tribe has waited not-so-patiently for Lilly to be free of Burke. Maybe he ran out of patients...after all, he did kill a man once.<br /><br />Ms. Sullivan La Pierre sure knows how to write a page-turning mystery. Though, about a third of the way through \\"Cause for Murder\\" I had a sneaky suspicion who the murderer was, I still eagerly turned the pages to find out if I was right, and I was!

She believes she's the long lost London Danvers, and if this it true, she stands to inherit fifty percent of the Danvers fortune.

She feels that if she's ever in danger, she won't need a weapon. All she has to do is scream and dial 911; the boys in blue will arrive in short order and haul the bad guy off to jail without drawing their guns. Whoa! What time warp did she fall into?<br /><br />When Susan's purse is stolen, she's outraged when the overworked police arrive an hour later and treat her like a ninny because she was stupid enough to leave her purse on the front seat of her unlocked car while she returned to the grocery store for something she forgot.<br />But the stolen purse was just the beginning of a bigger crime. A terrorist stalks Susan to gain access to a highly classified military project called S-2. Once he gets what he wants, he'll kill her while she's unarmed with the guns she hates.<br />Derrick Makay isn't about to let that happen. He works for the federal government in Homeland Security, and they have been chasing this terrorist for months. Derrick meant to bring him in peacefully or with a bullet in his brain. He doesn't care which, because the terrorist had already murdered twenty-seven innocent people.<br />Though Susan and Derrick are highly attracted to each other, they differ greatly on key issues such as gun control. She believes if all the guns are taken away, then the world would be a better place. Derrick believes she needs to educate herself with the facts, least of which is that not everyone is murdered with a gun. She must also learn that nothing is cut and dry on the mean streets of a big city, and sometimes you do what you can to survive.<br />Ms. Ferranno took on a controversial subject and presented the facts in this fiction thriller, while giving readers one heck of a good story.	2004-06-08

As Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci...clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.&lt;/i&gt;<br />...And so begins the Holy Grail hunt from Paris to London and back again.<br />My Mom often tells me to be careful what I read. She's afraid I'll be influenced by the dark side or sucked into beliefs that will send me to hell. Fortunately for me, my mind is not that weak. I have yet to read anything that has caused me to denounce God or not believe in His Son, Jesus. My faith is simple and not overcomplicated by the ravings of man.<br />My advice to you while reading this book is to read it with entertainment in mind. THE DA VINCI CODE will probably offend some Christians because there is a mention of Jesus and Mary Magdalene being married, touching on THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. Some Catholics will be offended because they are accused of suppressing other religions by turning their symbols into something evil, and trying to hide the truth of God, even going as far as to murder to protect the secret.<br />Even though Leonardo Da Vinci painted such masterpieces as THE LAST SUPPER and VIRGIN ON THE ROCKS he often mocked the church and &quot;painted Christian themes not as an expression of his own beliefs but rather as a commercial venture...a means of funding a lavish lifestyle&quot;. He also placed hidden symbols of paganism in his work. Believe it or not, I was a bit shocked by this discovery.

Now I'm not so sure, but only God knew Da Vinci's true heart, lest I should judge.<br />I learned something about THE LAST SUPPER painting I didn't know and was quite fascinated by!
