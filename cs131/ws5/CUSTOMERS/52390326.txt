Her attitude is not in the least bit disrespetful but takes cues, in general, from the medical profession where an over-familiarity with the body, life, and death creates a morbid sense of humor.  <br /> <br />Stiff is a wonderful book for any reader but makes an especially great book to get high schoolers interested in biology and anatomy/physiology. Of course, the same holds true for making college courses a little more interesting.  <br /> <br />Although I have not seen much mention of it in, Stiff is also a bit of a \\"how-to\\" guide. Roach's research gives enough information that the reader can really consider where they would like their body to be after death. (I had no idea I could be art!) <br /> <br />I can't imagine anyone not finding this book fascinating but if you like Six Feet Under, Dead Like Me, or any of the dozens of forensics shows on cable nowadays, you should absolutely read this book. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

The problem is not that the chapters alternate between the present and the past (if you are any kind of reader you've been there, done that), the problem is not that it is an unfamiliar landscape - we are talking 20th century Africa here. The problem is that after 100 pages, nothing has happened.  <br /> <br />Now, that might be okay provided that there were some detailed character studies. Alas, there are none of these either.  <br /> <br />I must echo an earlier observation that the author tried to pack in too many ideas to make any of them work properly. Interesting events are brought into play that after only a few paragraphs or a couple of pages are dropped and lost forever. Perhaps Abani was trying to show the rapid progression of life and the constant change occuring in Africa at the time but it does not make for good reading.  <br /> <br />Added effects, like the recipes that end each chapter, are neat but don't tie the story together in any pertinent way - the characters hardly ever eat or focus on food preparation and Elvis' memories of his mother do not dwell on food, either.  <br /> <br />The chapter prefixes on the Kola nut are also interesting but distract from the story and are forgotten as soon as the story continues.  <br /> <br />I had not heard of Mr. Abani's work prior to this novel and was shocked to see the list of credits to his name. On further consideration, I decided that this is a poet's novel - each scene may have been better written as a series of poems with the stunning imagery of the continent and commentary on the difficutlies of life left to themselves without attempts to connect them inbetween.  <br /> <br />I cannot, unfortunatley, recommend this to lovers of fiction, but I do intend to take a look at some of Mr. Abani's poetry.	2005-10-10

A modern young reader will not stay with this book long. Both its repetitive and lengthy text as well as its dully colored illustrations do not entice one to contine reading past the halfway point.    And although there is a happy ending, the reader is left feeling sorry for Matthew and Anna, not rejoicing at their freedom.    I do not know if Lindgren meant this to be so, but the story has the very strong feeling of being a metaphor for life on earth versus an after-life in heaven.     Unfortunately, not destined to be a classic.	2005-05-06

The author's use of \\"piggies\\" who meditate (instead of people) seems to \\"dumb down\\" the ideas in order to make it appealing to youngsters. The assumption seems to be that kids are not smart enough and/or not be interested enough to hear about how humans use and find peace through meditative techniques.    The text also over-generalizes the ideas and although there are slighly more lengthy explanation pages at the end of the book, there is still a tone of being talked down to which is a real turn-off.    Peaceful Piggy Meditation may have its place within a larger teaching unit on prayer, meditation, and self-awareness but the book does not, unfortunately, stand alone as instruction for what meditation is and how to use it, nor is it a stand alone \\"storybook.\\"	2005-05-06

Where Willy Went is recommended and formatted for ages 4-8 but seems much better suited to pre-teens - perhaps 8-12.     The tongue-in-cheek humor seems like it would be lost on the younger group and, although there are no actual sexual acts depicted, a few of the illustrations may cause confusion for younger children. The female body, in particular, is made to look more like a peninsula (the vagina is not clearly defined) and while the map-like quality of the male and female bodies is quite clever, it is a bit misleading.     There is no doubt I enjoyed this story of the little sperm Willy and his excellent swimming skills immensely and would consider it a great \\"gag\\" gift for any wedding shower, engagement party, etc.     It would also be a great tension breaker when discussing biological aspects of reproduction with 8-12 year olds but will definately require elaboration and parental assistance.	2005-05-06

The truth of the matter is that it is, at heart, another Bridges of Madison County - a trite love story that ignores the much more interesting aspects of life.  <br /> <br />Our heroine, Jessie, spends most of the book whining about her guilt and confusion over her love for her husband, Hugh (who she leaves behind on the mainland of South Carolina while going to her childhood home on Egret Island to take care of her mother), and her affair with Brother Thomas, a monk at the island's monastery (also referred to as Whit).  <br /> <br />Jessie's emotional development seems to have stopped some time in her teens and she clearly confuses sex with love and emotional attachment - as does her vow-breaking partner, Brother Thomas a.k.a. Whit.  <br /> <br />The interesting part of the story, and what should have been the real focus, is the charming, albeit fictional, island and its history and culture including the monastery's \\"mermaid chair\\", the mysterious death of Jessie's father when she was a child, and her mother's post-traumatic stress disorder. <br /> <br />Further obscuring the real pleasures of the book, is Kidd's technique of using Jessie's first person voice for the majority of the book and then suddenly diverging into omniscient chapters (with appropriately italicized names - \\"Brother Thomas\\" \\"Whit\\" or \\"Hugh\\" for readers not quite quick enough to catch the change) that are supposed to offer insight into the emotional issues of the male characters in Jessie's life. Not only is this technique distracting, it doesn't offer the reader a single non-cliched emotion or insight.  <br /> <br />Overall, The Mermaid Chair may be a marketing coup but it is a disappointing and stagnant read.	2005-04-19
US	52390326	R3DA05PH1Y8O8A	0618329706	509942691	Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close	Books	5	5	14	N	N	A masterpiece	\\"Masterpiece\\" is not a word I throw around lightly, but I truly feel it is a well-deserved and earned distinction for Jonathan Safran Foer's new novel, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.     Although the book has been reviewed and touted ad naseum as a novel about September 11, 2001, readers will not get a blow by blow account of the events of that day. Instead, Foer has used that tragedy as a background to create a circular theme about the effects of traumatic love and loss.     Centered around a precocious nine-year-old boy (Oskar) whose father was killed in the World Trade Center attacks and a mysterious key that sets Oskar on a quest for answers, Foer profoundly, but subtly, connects the horrors of Oskar's grandparent's experiences in World War 2 to his Oskar's own loss on September 11.     Despite the differences in political, social, economic, and religious climate between the two events, the similarities of their ensuing effects on the human psyche, and more specifically on Oskar's family, are striking. Oskar is a new generation learning and remembering the very, very, long term sadness that comes from war and loss.    Foer's use of unusual techniques (including blank pages and pictures)works within the novel to great effect, despite the prevailing attitude that they are a bit over the top.    Since I tend to be someone who finds connections in places where maybe they shouldn't be, I would like to suggest that anyone reading this book listen to the album (or CD - sorry - I'm from the album generation...) Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot by Wilco (which has also been classed as a masterpiece by many music lovers). While reading Foer's novel, I often found myself thinking about this music as a \\"soundtrack\\" to the book, most especially the songs Jesus, Etc. (\\"Your voice is smoking, last cigarettes are all you can get\\"), War on War (You have to lose; You have to learn how to die If you want to want to be alive\\"), Ashes of American Flags (\\"All my lies are always wishes, Iknow I would die if I could come back new\\"), Radio Cure (\\"Oh distance has a way of making love understandable\\"). I think Oskar could easily have written any of these songs.     I can't recommend enough that you find some quality time to be immersed in this book and truly enjoy its many layers and subtleties. Even if you don't get it, you'll have something to talk about besides the weather.     [...]	2005-04-12

From the ocean's depths to exotic lands, from fishermen and sailors and mermaids to polar bears and ships, this short prose poem explores all the regions of the sea. <br /> <br />As with many children's books, however, the real value is in the exquisite pictures. Reminiscent of vintage book illustrations and the art of the likes of Jessie Wilcox Smith, Claire Fletcher has beautifully created unusual images in calm but colorful paintings that spark the imagination.  <br /> <br />Although the language of The Seashell Song is a bit advanced (words like \\"brilliance,\\" \\"swarthy,\\" \\"minarets,\\" and \\"bewitched\\" are not usually found in books recommended for baby to preschool aged) it is a wonderful book to share with a child to engender a love of beauty both in sound and vision.

A lovely, short, picture book for young (to very young) children that deals with death.  <br /> <br />Arthur's beloved dog, Daisy, dies in her sleep one night. Of course Arthur and his family are sad. Daisy, watching from heaven, decides to send Arthur some dreams. In this way, she lets him know that she is happy in heaven, with lots of friends and feeling fine, and that she doesn't mind at all if Arthur decides to get another puppy.  <br /> <br />Chichester's book certainly doesn't answer all the questions a child may have about death but it does address the loss of a pet very well. Unlike many books that deal with the loss of loved ones that fall very heavily on the reader, Up In Heaven also stands alone as a lovely storybook. Illustrations are bright and beautiful. <br /> <br />Although not religious in nature, the story is skewed to religions that believe in heaven and a possible afterlife. I hope my pups go to Chichester's heaven when they pass on!  <br />	2004-10-31

Ann and her family make a heroic effort and save many lives. But the story of Ann goes deeper than her selfless help in the shipwreck and Major has worked in some insightful passages as Ann struggles to make herself, her family, and Seamus happy. <br />This beautiful book - it would not far-fetched to call this an art book - is an interesting mix of unusual historical fiction detailing a young woman's heroism and coming-of-age highlighted by seven of David Blackwood's monochromatic and atmospheric illustrations.

An extensive Introduction provides an historical look at hort shows and their beginnings as a working-class past-time and brings us up to date to today's modern day flower show equivalents which often include artistic classes as well as other types of sidelines such as craft shows and recipe booths.<br />Buchan chose six shows to focus on: The Abergavenny and Border Counties Agricultural Society's Annual Show; Dumfries and Lockerbie Agricultural Society's Annual Show; Aberystwyth and District Agricultural Society's Annual Show; Warmington Horticultural Society's Annual Show; North Somerset Agricultural Society's Annual Ploughing Match; and The National Northern Rose Show; with a chapter devoted to each.  <br />Since the focus is on horticultural shows there is a lot of detail about showing produce but there is also plenty of floral variety. Each chapter is part travelogue, describing the towns where the shows are held and the areas around them, part interview, detailing a few of the local competitors and their specialties, and part tip sheet, including the competitors own tips and favorite stories.<br />An interesting look at how village shows developed and have changed over the years, this book is not to be missed by anyone who has been bitten by the flower-show-bug.	2004-03-21

For the second year in a row, the criteria for winning the National Book Award seems to consist of novels with pretentious and verbose writing, unlikable characters, and a condensation of other (and better) books. Three Junes lives up to these criteria in spades. As a very voracious reader I rarely spend more than a week or two with a book - it took me over eight months to plow through this muddy mess of a book. <br />In a novel without a story or plot line, one expects that there may be some serious character study or some insightful gleanings about life as we know it. Unfortunately, Glass has done a mediocre, at best, job of creating such a book. Her characters (including her heroes Paul, Fenno, and Fern) are shallow, cold, unlikable, self-absorbed and completely underdeveloped. The novel's three barely connected sections just graze over the surface of an insight about the continuation of life and perpetuation of love and friendship despite, or maybe because of, the passing of those closest to us. <br />Overall Three Junes is a disappointing read covering topics and characters that were better written elsewhere. For an endearing bookshop clerk read Parnassas on Wheels by Christopher Morley. For a great book about gay relationships, AIDS, and fathering another's child, read A Home At the End of the World by Michael Cunningham.	2004-03-15

My understanding of the Caldecott Medal is that is awarded to an outstanding picture book artist and that the text can be inconsequential in consideration of the award. <br />That being the case, there is no doubt that The Man Who Walked Between the Towers deserves its prize. A fascinating snapshot of time is captured in this book with an amazing eye towards unusual perspectives and views and innovative page designs, including two fold outs. <br />While the text of the story is a little awkward, it gets the point across. Gerstein seems to end Petit's story before the book ends and uses the final pages to focus the reader on the World Trade Center, not Petit, leaving the reader a little unsure if the book is a memorial to Petit or to the towers.<br />Ultimately, one is not unhappy to end up calling it a little bit of both.	2004-03-14

US	52390326	R2HIM9JG5OBWE	0871139081	999926399	Loving Che	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Interesting narrative, lovely writing	With beautiful imagery and intriguing language, Menendez has created a mysterious and intriguing story about love, family, and revolutionary Cuba. <br />This enchanting diptych of a novel begins in standard form with the narrator questioning her childhood in Miami and expressing her frustration at the lack of information she is able to get from her grandfather about her past and her parents. When a mysterious package arrives filled with letters and photos, the novel takes a stylistic turn and we are thrust into a wholly different life; the life of an artist in Cuba in the 1950s. In brief and beautifully written vignettes, these \\"letters\\" seemingly explain the narrator's mother's life and her clandestine affair with Che Guevara.<br />A return to the narrator's voice at the end of the novel details a renewed search for her mother using the information that has been revealed in the letters. While at the heart of the matter the question seems to be whether or not the narrator is the daughter of Che Guevara, the narrator focuses on her search for her mother and Guevara seems to be an afterthought. <br />While the initial change in narrative is slightly jarring, it is reflective of how we remember and of how and what one chooses to tell about ones life. The return of the narrator's voice is a smooth transition and further illuminates the letters and the difficulty in both sharing secrets and yet keeping them. As Teresa writes to her daughter \\"...life is not a tidy narrative.... We learn this late. These scraps of memory that become untethered from the rest, flapping disconsolately in the wind, these memories are the most important of all. Memories like these remind us that life is also loose ends, small events that have no bearing on the story we come to write of ourselves.\\"	2004-02-17

While no readers will admittedly identify with any of Homes' characters or situations there is no doubt that all readers will, on some level, find something that sounds familiar. <br />Homes is incredibly skilled at picking apart the dreams all Americans harbor and of showing us the hellish reflection in the mirror. Her characters are not outlandish and as much as we would like these stories to be inconceivable they could easily be articles in the daily newspaper of any \\"normal\\" town. Her ability to break the fine line between maintaining an acceptable life and shattering the set molds calls into question the true meaning of \\"mental illness\\". <br />If you are easily offended, these stories are not for you.	2004-02-17

Further decorated at the edges with mud cloth patterns, Diakite has provided two pages of additional notes at the end of the book to help clarify the patterns' meanings as well as to give some background to his home of Mali, West Africa and some language translations. <br />While written in traditional picture book format, this book is best read to youngsters for both the joy of oral storytelling traditions which are so important to folk tales as well as because of the potential unfamiliarity of some words and the occasional irregularity of traditional English grammar. Besides, they will not be able to keep their eyes from the illustrations long enough to read a whole page! A fun family read.	2004-02-09

A great biography for the under-12 crowd, The Boy on Fairfield Street is beautifully illustrated and tenderly written. From Ted's experiences with bullies to a humiliating experience with former President Theodore Roosevelt, Krull has shown the reader Ted's common failings as well as his extraordinary perseverance. Disappointing, however, is the short-stop ending just after Ted moves to New York at 22, before any of his famous children's books were written. There is an additional four page narrative but it is not fully illustrated as the rest of the story is and may leave some children cold unless they have help to get through it. Overall, a wonderful book that is just perfect for a celebration of Dr. Seuss's birthday on March 2 or a celebration of this year's Seussentennial.	2004-02-08

There is no doubt that both of these make Big Fish an incredibly intricate novel. <br />But Wallace's ability to write in the way we remember is what makes Big Fish a great read. Although we generally follow his tale of William Bloom's father, Edward Bloom, in chronological order, it is not necessarily so. The reader is never quite sure when a specific tale occurred, nor does it matter in your understanding of Edward or of William. The tales occur as they are triggered in William's memory, as he strives to understand his father, to see what he has seen and feel what he has felt. <br />Wallace's writing reflects the joys of oral traditions, of storytelling, of fabrication, of fantasy, of re-creating ourselves in other's eyes and the consequences that may bring.<br />Big Fish is a wonderful, multi-layered series of stories combined to create a joy of a novel.	2004-02-08

Shreve continues however, to create a story after the initial romance involving our heroine, Olympia, and her struggle to find the child she gave birth to. <br />Unfortunately, Olympia, (who is portrayed as independent but helpless, self-assured but needy) is generally unlikable. While I hesitate to say she got what she deserved, I do not find much sympathy for her or her lover who had the courage to ruin the lives of both of their families but not the courage to find each other again - in the face of it all - to be together. <br />While Shreve is skilled at creating a sense of place, and the beach community of Fortune's Rocks is enviable, her characterizations in this novel do not ring true and lack depth, insight or interest.	2004-02-08

While Earthly Goods was most likely right on target for 1994, when it was published, ten years later it is outdated but does not, unfortunately, read like a history. (Shaman Pharmaceuticals, for example, seems like a promising enterprise in this book. I thought I might check out their stock. They are bankrupt and have regrouped as Shaman Botanicals with only one product in their line, as far as I can tell. Stock is OTCBB at $0.002 as of today.)<br />Joyce's writing is dry and often times fairly technical leaving a layman reader like myself in the dark and, more importantly, skipping to the next paragraph. Readers with a specific interest in botany and pharmaceutical derivatives in plants may still find some of the information of value but it does not qualify as a good introduction for those without prior knowledge of the field. <br />Although I had high-hopes for this book, a revised edition where these stories are anthologized and recent findings and updates are discussed would have been much more useful.	2004-01-31

Anderson has written a refreshing science fiction novel in a genre that has recently relied largely on fantasy and far less on science. He has created a not-to-distant future world where everything is accessed via a \\"feed\\" that is implanted directly into the brain. An internalized internet, the feed even allows for \\"chatting\\" so there is little need to speak if one chooses not to and true reading is nearly obsolete.<br />While the narrator, Titus, lives in a world that is still identifiable to those of us in the 21st century - school (although it is trademarked), parties, music, driving, dancing, and drinking - there are also unfamiliar and extreme aspects like an electronic drug substitute, standardized lingo, disposable tables, and extreme consumerism. Even this tightly controlled future however, is peppered with resisters, and Titus' own girlfriend suffers horribly from her feed when it malfunctions due to a combination of having it implanted late in life (when she was 7) and being hit by a \\"hacker\\". <br />Perhaps because it is a young adult novel, Anderson just barely skims the surface of the economic, political and environmental tensions of the feed and its consumer culture. He does not, however, wimp out in building believable, dimensional characters and relationships. <br />Anderson has created an intriguing read about a world that is so close you may be reading about the first \\"feed\\" in the newspaper tomorrow.	2004-01-28

However, by looking just beneath the surface, one finds that Martin has imbued his characters with great insight about the limits and frustrations of desire and love.<BR> <BR>For example, as part of an anti-climactic romance story, Mirabella's encounter with her father's ex-army buddy would seem out of place and unimportant. However, when put into context, the reader gains some insight into Mirabella's need for a strong father figure who showers her with attention and makes her feel like a daddy's girl. When Ray explores the concept further, identifying his need to protect Mirabella as the duty of a father, not a lover, he realizes that his inability to find a mate hinges on his dichotomous desires for youthful beauty and mature intelligence -a nearly impossible feat.<br />As counterfoil to Mirabella, who is looking for truth and companionship, Martin introduces Mirabella's co-worker who simply longs to exert control over every man she meets and to obtain approval in all things sexual. While her promiscuity is the opposite of Mirabella's desires, her needs most likely stem from the same undeniable urges to defend oneself against being alone.<BR>  <BR>Overall, Shopgirl is a compelling novella that creates a snapshot of life as a search for love, in all its incarnations, and of love as a psychological necessity to complete one's sense of worth.	2004-01-28

Hattie is a loner who prefers the company of her family's boarding home residents to the snickering insipidness of her classmates. When her Uncle-kept-secret, Adam, comes into her life, she finds him to be a challenging but worthy friend. She sees a joy in life through his eyes that she has never seen before and she learns a sense of responsibility and righteousness in situations where she would otherwise not have been challenged. His presence and his own personal mental challenges/illness give Hattie insight into her family members and the lives they lived before she existed. And while Hattie does find friendship with a like-aged young woman who proves that not all teens are insensitive and self-centered, it is Adam who helps her understand herself and the world a little better, even when some of the lessons are hard to learn. <br />While A Corner of the Universe is not a book that keeps the reader riveted at attention with action packed scenes of danger and fantasy, Hattie's growth as a character is exceptional and the treatment of difficult subject matter is handled with such skill that A Corner of the Universe is a wonderful read for any age.	2004-01-25

Ms. Ravitch could probably have benefited from a good editor, and some organization to condense much of the information of the first six chapters into one or two. Many of her points about the influence of gender specific groups, nationality specific groups, religious organizations, and others, as well as some of the specific examples of test and text-book wording and/or topic changes are repeated in these first six chapters on several occasions. The summary of this repetition seems to boil down to the fact that censorship of tests and textbooks is so similar they may as well be identical, with only the names of the groups who are creating them and influencing them changing slightly. <br />As Ms. Ravitch continues her discussion of the new regime of \\"politically correct\\" terminology additions and \\"stereotypical\\" or \\"offensive\\" description removals in texts used to teach literature and history, she discusses the important facts surrounding the perceived need to \\"sanitize\\" literature and history for children but she fails to acknowledge the difficulty(or offer solutions)in determining what \\"literature\\" is. She also seems to completely overlook the challenge of discussing an additional fifty years worth of history (from the time of the post-WW2 textbooks she appears to hold a fondness for) without eliminating or condensing SOMETHING. <br />Finally, her suggestions for thwarting the \\"language police\\" are obvious and although she suggests that we work to stop the practice of statewide textbook adoptions, particularly in Texas and California, she does not supply us with names or organizations to contact or suggestions for HOW to do so. <br />An extremely important topic for parents, educators, librarians, writers, readers, and anyone concerned about the education of the youth of the United States, Ravitch's book is a bit repetitive, somewhat lacking in focus, but is a good introduction to some of the problems educators are facing today.	2003-12-07

Suzan-Lori Parks' Pulitzer Prize winning play, Topdog Underdog, shows the strength of Parks' ability to write convincing dialogue, to develop memorable characters and in the process to create something of a meaningful nature. Certainly this two-man play contains black male stereotypes that are uncomfortable to deal with, however this seems to be the point. While the reader hopes that Lincoln and Booth are caricatures, or at the very least are only representative of an extinct past, the fact is these two men could easily exist in modern day society, and probably do. Parks adds a large dose of irony to their lives: their names, their family, their occupations (or lack of), their girlfriends (or lack of), that gives the play a dark comedy feel. <br />Beyond the immediate action, Parks has managed to take the reader further, creating a symbolic and meaningful statement in a worldly sense. It is interesting that because this play is written by a black woman it is considered to be a statement on black society. The work, when read and reread, takes on multifaceted meanings in the world of the reader, of any color, and while the surface level of introspection seems to hint at the stereotypical perpetuation of black men making bad choices and keeping themselves in the fringes of society, these two \\"brothers\\" truly represent \\"everyman,\\" who battle with each other in a continued \\"sibling rivalry,\\" attempting to distance themselves from their past, maintain control over their future and to control their own and each other's lives. Literature, as reflection of life, has shown us the error of our ways time and time again and Parks reminds us that human nature is inescapable and that we are our worst enemy. <br />(Note: This review is based on reading the play. I have not seen the play performed)	2003-10-20

Martin's latest book, The Pleasure of My Company, revolves completely around Daniel Pecan Cambridge, a \\"benign\\" obsessive-compulsive personality who is endearing and funny and very, very real. Martin's ability to relate specific personal details and the fine-tuning of Daniel's inner monologue make the character strikingly authentic. And while there is a lot of laugh-out-loud funny stuff (like the fact that Daniel thinks a jogging suit consists of khakis and loafers, or the scene following this athletic foray that involves some wayward Mineral Ice) Martin does not miss his chance to create a character searching for a fulfilling life. While Daniel's past history is not too detailed and a small segment hinting at a past hardship with his father is vague and a little distracting, overall the reader understands Daniel's self-imposed failings and cheers at the smallest of his accomplishments. An exquisite character study and a truly enjoyable read.	2003-10-12

Unfortunately, the tone of this book is spiritually stunted and although the book takes place in &quot;heaven,&quot; Albom is not brave enough to identify Eddie's own spiritual identity and/or beliefs nor does the reader ever see or meet a divine creator or being. Instead, Albom hits the reader over the head with his earthly &quot;insights&quot; which are rote and predictable - be good, find joy, don't underestimate yourself, blah, blah, blah. Perhaps this would make a nice, short, morality play for pre-teens but it is not a book that will change anyone's life.	2003-10-08

Jonathan Hunt has translated Niccolo Ammaniti's disturbing story beautifully, capturing the hard realities of desperate and self-righteous people along with the sinister and surreal atmosphere that slowly descends around Michele and his family. A difficult book to discuss without revealing plot lines and endings, Ammaniti has, in an unusual sense, written a compelling psychological thriller and has created a story that does not end with the printed page but within the reader's own imagination.	2003-10-07
US	52390326	R2BTO12SEOQWKN	0060934417	546555129	Bel Canto	Books	2	13	14	N	N	An unfortunate story	Despite its premise, centering on a terrorist/hostage situation, Bel Canto does little more than cast a shadow of a standard \\"Stockholm syndrome\\" story where innocent cardboard cut-out hostages fall in love with each other and their not-so-terrifying terrorist captors. <BR>Forgoing even a build-up of tension, Patchett reveals the novel's ending on page thirteen (paperback edition) with the line, \\"...when in fact it was the terrorists who would not survive the ordeal.\\" Perhaps if Patchett had added some insight to her characters, anything that would indicate their development psychologically, sociologically, politically, or literally, the flimsy plot line could be forgiven. Unfortunately there are none either on the characters' behalf, or the reader's. The ultimate ending is completely unsatisfactory and does not allow for the characters previous interactions and personality developments and feels tacked on, as if an editor required a few more pages of text.<BR>Bel Canto may have plenty of book club potential, but it is, overall, a disappointing read.	2003-09-05

As the narrative unfolds, the reader watches as Paul's obsessive attempts to make sense of his wife's death force him to become reclusive, to relentlessly pursue a pay-by-the-minute phone psychic, and to try to teach his dog, and only witness to Lexy's death, Lorelei, to speak. <br />\\"Dogs\\" is a modern day fairy tale in the true Brothers Grimm fashion. Parkhurst has crafted a sweet story of romance and love counter-balanced by deep sadness, despair, and the desperation of grief. Not a novel to be taken in the literal sense, \\"Dogs\\" explores the surreal and often futile attempts of survivors to answer questions surrounding a loved one's death and to blame themselves even when circumstances are beyond their control. Parkhurst skims the surface of mental illness and its sometimes exasperating silence and links it to the allegorical Cerberus Society, whose sole purpose is to create a speaking dog.  <br />Masks, ghosts, talking dogs and hidden messages combined with raw human emotions in a familiar household setting create an atmospheric and beautifully layered story. A wonderful read, without a doubt this season's \\"The Lovely Bones\\", and a story that will stay with you long after the last page has turned. <br />*Having read and reviewed this book, and then read other's reviews, I must add a personal note of recommendation that readers approach this book with no expectations. Ignore the hype, ignore the reviews, yes, even mine, and approach this book with an open, inquiring, intellectual mind. If you do so, I think you will be pleased. As my mother always says, the origin of resentment is expectation. Good reading!	2003-08-16

Parks accurately depicts snapshots of scenes with visually stimulating language leaving you with images of doctor's office's floors or flour soiled dresses creating a book that plays like a film inside your head.  <br />Parks' technique of showing a different character's point of view in each short chapter (twenty characters contribute their first person accounts along the journey) allows for a deep understanding of each player from Billy's one-legged Aunt to Billy's mother's lesbian-passing-as-a-man lover. Even Billy's dead mother, Willa Mae, speaks through her left-behind blues songs lyrics and a well-taught scam for making quick cash. Parks has fully developed these folks, right down to their Hurston-esque speech patterns, and her knack for snappy, flowing dialogue is wonderful. <br />Not as heavy as The Color Purple, but reminiscent of its style and character development, and capturing a Faulknerian sense of place, Getting Mother's Body may make itself a spot alongside other important works of fiction for its literary beauty and originality.	2003-07-21

From the loss of husbands, lovers, jobs and businesses to the excitement of new love, full scholarships, babies and quinceaneras, it is impossible to get to know these characters and their true selves. Back stories and dirty laundry abound but do not amount to real insight into each characters heart. <br />Both Dee, a white woman from the Westside, and Alma, a Mexican woman from the barrio, could easily be the same woman - struggling with backgrounds of rejection and loss, single parenthood and prejudice, but Barrientos has gone out of her way to make an important and single distinction between the two women - money. Dee's wealth is, ultimately, what keeps everyone happy and although the strength of the Frontera Street neighborhood bond comes through it is disappointing to watch Alma and her daughter leave the Street solely for the purpose of wealth and prestige. <br />Barrientos' writing is stylish and, at times, fun. By far the most engaging part of the story is a flashback detailing the story of \\"The Miracle Muffin.\\" Initially a short story of its own, the description of the milagro and its effect on family, community, and faith is the most in-depth, provocative and endearing section of the book. <br />A good book club read, Frontera Street will provoke discussions about our own boundaries and the development of friendship, it also allows for interesting discussion on what it means to read about a character and feel as if you \\"know\\" them.	2003-07-17

Today I had a quarter pound (and they were delish!). Hilary - I can only blame you. <br />This fabulously fun book combines sweet with bittersweet in an all out original twist on the memoir.  Composed of 57 anecdotes, some only a half of a page in length, this quick read details a life lived through candy consumption, but this is not another blow by blow memoir. While the reader certainly gets a general overview of the author's life there is not a sense that you have lived with Liftin - you do not endure her every waking moment, every high and low, just the important points (i.e.: the candy...).  And while you know you like her, and easily identify with her childhood follies and romantic foibles, you realize the author is just a normal gal, like your best friend from high school. Of course the memoir is profoundly marked by the enjoyment of pound after pound of nostalgic confections and Liftin's descriptive abilities and word-play make your mouth water.  <br />But Liftin does not glamorize her \\"addiction\\", or leave us with a book of fluff. She struggles with her ability to identify, but inability to define, her addiction to candy. The worry that it is biological and inescapable vs. the worry that it is psychological and just an easy way to make her feel good about herself (or is it a sly combination of the two?) is no doubt the same worry we have all struggled with regardless of what our own addiction is. <br />Patrick Barth's chapter heading illustrations and illustrated \\"Candy Timeline\\" and \\"Candy Math\\" charts must not be overlooked. They completely set the tone of the book and are just great at rounding out an already fun, not-to-be-missed book.	2003-07-13

Although set in Philadelphia in the 1980's Shawn McBride has fostered an authentic feel for neighborhood life and politics in just about any city in the United States. While there are obvious details that make it Phila to those who know it, an outsider will not be in the dark if they haven't visited Tack Park or seen a 76ers game. The voice of 13-year-old Henry Toohey is brash and fresh and although female readers may have difficulty discerning if Henry's voice rings true (do 13-year-old boys really think about boobs THAT much?), Henry is a bright star in a world stuffed with books about young women \\"coming of age\\".  Henry's constant fluctuations between immaturity and maturity, his desperate desire to make everything right for everyone, for his family to be happy and whole, and his naivet in believing he can bring it about single-handedly (and at all) with a premature wedding proposal to his beloved, chain-smoking, young love, Grace, is heart wrenching. And while every character in Henry's world is dysfunctional (the rule, not the exception), they are all dynamic, eccentric, powerful, compelling, insightful, touching, and familiar. Wonder abounds that they can survive each other at all. Shawn McBride's prose is musical and wonderful. The first couple of paragraphs demand to be read out loud and they suck you into Henry's attitude for life, into his world, and really set the pace. McBride's writing hits a beat like Henry's beloved record albums, resonating with life, love and the desire to persevere.	2003-07-10

The book's loose flow seems created for browsing, and each time it is opened a new tidbit is found. Especially nice is the emphasis on being a little messy in the garden. Attracting birds means letting things to go to seed, including allowing lettuce to bolt, not hard pruning shrubs in the spring to allow for nesting, and letting some of those dropped branches stay put. It's so nice to see these ever so slightly sloppy gardens that are still aesthetically pleasing. <BR>Plant descriptions detail the plant's worth in the bird garden and list what birds will use them for - fruits, shelter, nesting, etc. Descriptions also include common and botanical names, general cultivation information and full color photos. Bird descriptions include information on habits, habitats, preferred foods, nest types, and common and Latin names along with full color photos and range maps.<BR>BH & G books have come a long way in recent years taking steps to marry inspirational photos with sound gardening practices; Bird Gardens is no exception.	2003-05-20

Detailing more than two dozen gardens, Front Yard Gardens is instant motivation for anyone tired or mowing, weeding, watering and fertilizing lawns. With the author's short history of lawns and their demand on us and the environment it is clear to see why many may be happier if lawns went away. But Primeau certainly does not demonize the practice and fully admits that the problem is certainly not the plants - it is the way most of us choose to care for our lawns that impacts the land. Primeau's own garden was a decade long labor of love proving that eliminating a lawn can be arduous - but more arduous than lawn maintenance? Probably not. While the garden vignettes focus more on the individual space's history than providing how-to information, it is clear to see that diverse multi-species gardens can be immensely more entertaining than a single species mono-culture like turf grass. Several of the front yard gardens detailed in the book do maintain a small lawn space but most seem to have completely eliminated their lawns opting for lush garden plantings combined with hardscaping practicalities like paths, steps, fences and driveways, and, in one instance, even artificial turf, as well as fun garden features like ponds, bird houses, and sitting areas. Full color photos by Andrew Leyerle provide multiple views of the gardens, in some cases even highlighting their seasonal changes. A book for every garden style, level, and interest, Front Yard Gardens should not be missed.	2003-05-20

While much of the book is given over to explanations of symbolism and ceremonies including the use of spiritual and ceremonial items in the garden and details for performing seasonal healing rituals, chapters are included on choosing a garden site, style and plants. 50 herbs are profiled with short sections on history, modern and traditional uses, cautions to use, growing tips, and a sketch. Additional chapters provide culinary recipes and craft ideas as well as many recipes for beauty aids such as skin scrubs, shampoos, lotions, and soaking teas. While mainly a guide to creating a sacred space, gardening information is sound and conservative and includes the importance of compost and mulch as well as the importance of selecting the right plant for the right site.

While the mice names and a few literary references are cute, the overall story is rather dull with very little tension being formed within the plot. Most of the book is given over to introducing and reintroducing the residents of Tottensea Burrows without much in the way of adventures (including a chapter of furious dressmaking and preparation for the Tottensea Burrows Midsummer's Night Fancy Dress Cotillion Ball, followed by a chapter describing the details of those who did not attend the Ball and not more than a page or a page and a half of the Ball itself) creating what seems to be a shallow set up for possible future endeavors of these mice in their newly achieved, materially unburdened existence away from the farm house and out in the field, where true field mice should be. Children will be overwhelmed with the vocabulary, yet adults will find the storytelling trite and predictable. A sadly disappointing read.	2003-04-08

Identification is aided by a short description as well as a black and white sketch and a full-color photo. Each two-page spread discusses one bird with details including migration and winter range, breeding range and behavior, nesting, and a short list of plants to use for bird food. <BR>The feeding guide is garden and plant focused (rather than the typical hanging birdfeeder type focus) with the idea of using native plantings to attract and feed birds. Purchased seed options are rarely mentioned. <BR>As organized and helpful as the individual page layouts are, the overall organization of the book is lacking. The reader is forced to browse through all 64 birds in the directory section to find what is being sought since the birds are not listed in any particular order. The book's lack of regional focus is also limiting and reduces the number of relevant entries to about 30 if you live in New Jersey, for example. <BR>The final section of the book is a plant directory which is organized alphabetically by scientific name. The section includes photos and general cultural guidelines for plants that will shelter and feed the birds previously discussed. A list of \\"Birds Attracted\\" within the individual plant descriptions is a nice cross-reference with the bird directory section.<BR>The dichotomy of the book should not put you off - it is clearly written and useful despite its overall lack of organization.

While walking the gardener through the basic steps for garden planning, McHoy gets gardeners and designers thinking about the features that are most desirable in the garden (do you prefer beds, borders, an herb garden, a kitchen garden, space for a barbeque, seating area, compost area, etc.)while incorporating a sense of style. McHoy makes great suggestions for difficult sites and unusual shapes including roof gardens, patios, basement gardens, balconies and verandas. He doesn't neglect practical hardscape features like walls, floors, fences, hedges, lighting, arches and ornaments and even encourages the use of water features. While much of the book approaches gardening with a design emphasis, there are, of course, plant suggestions, and several well-illustrated how-to projects. Don't pass by this book if you have a larger garden - since McHoy helps the gardener to think more creatively about conserving space and the creative use of space - why not get more out of your garden regardless of its size!	2002-11-24

The terrible torture of those taken and their always sad fates are told through the &quot;imagination&quot; of Carlos, but it is through Carlos' actions that we see the terrible loss, guilt, and helplessness of those not taken. Wonderfully written, Thornton's writing flows easily drawing you to read on despite your dread of what may come next. An amazingly sad book that is full of hope. It teaches us, again, that the human spirit cannot be broken.	2002-09-14

This is the second children's book of writer/illustrator team Eileen Spinelli and Jane Dyer who have the ability to create instant classics in the children's book department. In Sophie's Masterpiece, thier second effort together, Sophie the spider is a web-spinner extraordinaire whose works go largly unappreciated by the residents of Beekman's Bordinghouse. By the time Sophie finds a comfortable home with a  \\"young woman\\" on the thrid floor, she is very old and tired - but she finds the strength to spin one last work of art for the young woman's new baby. Spinelli has taken the cycle of life and death and created a story that, while ultimately sad at the end, does not dampen the wonderful feelings you have for Sophie's selfless and beautiful act. Dyer's watercolor illustrations are perfectly in tune with the story and are incredibly detailed from Sophie's shadow on the staircase to the individual strands of each of Sophie's webs! A truly beautiful book all the way around.	2002-07-02

Here is a book that covers every potential garden project you can think of - and shows them all to you for comparison. Not a typical garden book - information on specific plants and growing instructions are not the main themes here - there are step-by-step plans and project guides for countless garden improvements including building an arbor, creating focal points, planting fruit crops and caring for your water garden, to name a very few. By far the best part of this book is a section titled &quot;What Looks Good When&quot; that helps you plan a true 4-season garden. Subtitles include &quot;Good Year Round&quot; &quot;Long Flowering Season&quot; &quot;Spring&quot; all the way through &quot;Autumn to Winter&quot;. How long have you waited for this?! Obviously not a comprehensive list but illustrated with color photos of the plants, it will inspire you to &quot;fix&quot; your two or three season garden and make it a dream all year round. The &quot;What to Do When&quot; section is a fabulous to-do check list that is wonderfully organized by season to help you get all of your tasks done in a timely fashion. The American Horticultural Society has done a bang-up job of giving gardeners some of the best resources in years and done so with beautiful photos, great information and wonderful ideas.	2002-07-02

Edwin, of course, remains one of the .3ers and, after losing his wife (but having to keep the cat), his money, his home, his lover, and gaining a broken thumb, must make the quest to return the world to its former unhappy self. <br />Ferguson's style is witty and modern with a sly intellectual spin.

Books	3	26	28	N	N	Interesting technique	Composting without the bin is the basic idea behind Patricia Lanza's lasagna gardening technique involving the layering of organic materials to create new, raised gardening beds. Her first chapter explains the technique, theory and materials in detail and is a great how-to guide. However, after the inital explanation, the book turns into a typical, although well organized and nicely written, garden handbook with chapters on vegetables, herbs, berries and flowers. Lanza has a wealth of gardening experience and offers many \\"tips and time savers\\" throughout the book. The final chapters include information on gardening for birds, extending the gardening season, and organic approaches to pest control. Finally, Lanza returns to the lasagna technique and adapts it for the reader's use in small and unusual spaces, as well as for container gardening. Although most of us won't have all the materials on hand initially for much more than a small plot, it is worth learning this earth-friendly method, and you may pick up a tip or two from Lanza's vast gardening experiences.	2002-06-18

Philippa Warning shows us how to achieve this ideal setting by walking us through the basic design principles of feng shui in The Feng Shui of Gardening. Waring emphasizes key elements including the importance of representing all the forces of nature (wood, fire, earth, metal and water) and allowing them to play against and with each other to create a positive flow of Chi.<BR>While the directionally-challenged among us may be frustrated with Waring's initial attempts to interpret the \\"facing\\" direction of our homes and gardens (the front is not always where your door is!), the chapters on fragrant flowers, trees, and bamboos, with their select lists and descriptions of plants, puts the reader back into the feng shui state of mind.<BR>Waring has a clear understanding of the feng shui concepts and presents them here in a compact, easy-to-reference book that can be used to create a brand-new garden or to simply adapt your current garden to include feng shui principles.	2002-06-05

Whether you want to learn about propagation by seed, cutting, layering, grafting, division, leaves, roots or how to propagate geophytes, the clear, detailed instructions and step-by-step photos will get you working in no time. Ken Druse, gardener and photographer extraordinaire, has packed this book with photos and has not started in on the details without providing plenty of preparation tips including information on seed collecting and storing and a quick botany lesson. And Druse doesn't leave you guessing about how to propagate the plants you want - an extensive appendix fills you in on the best methods for specific plants by listing them alphabetically. Making More Plants is incredibly useful as both a quick reference and as a gardening textbook for learning more complex techniques.	2002-05-10

If you love herbs, if you love cottage gardens, or country gardens, or flower gardens, then you will love Gardening with Herbs. While many garden books have great photos or good content (but rarely, it seems, both), Gardening with Herbs has married the two beautifully. A pleasant read, garden descriptions often include quotes from the gardeners themselves and usually at least a partial list of plants used. From a perennial garden in California to a lavender field turned topiary garden in the countryside of France there are ideas and incredible inspirations for any garden style.	2002-05-02

The days of needing two weed books - one that loves 'em, one that hates 'em - is over! Grab Weeds: Friend or Foe? for a wonderful change of pace in the world of weeds! While Sally Roth certainly does not encourage rampant weed growth in our lawns and gardens, her new book takes a relaxed and reasonable approach to weeds in our lives. Here is all the info in one place - without the usual biases. Ms. Roth does an excellent job of providing the pros (friend? - chickweed - stellaria media - can be used in salads before flowering) and cons (foe? - lamb's quarters - chenopodium album - can produce 75,000 seeds per plant) of each weed and allows the gardener to be discerning enough to make her own decision. But then this book goes the extra step with its section on what to do with weeds - like gardening WITH them - wow - healing with them, crafting with them. Although Ms. Roth does get to herbicides she does so responsibly and only after she has provided information on mulching, hand weeding, hoeing, and flame-throwers(!?). Herbicides are discussed in an excellent chart that provides a breakdown by type of garden and then discusses what the typical weed problem in that garden may be, what active ingredient may be best to use including some brand names, a description of how the herbicide works, plus any health concerns and/or environmental concerns a gardener may have by using a specific active ingredient. While there are clear photos of the identified weeds, this book would be doubly useful had there been seedling pictures, particularly since Ms. Roth spends much time explaining how important it is to be preventative and to pull weeds very early on. A great gift book for any gardener!	2002-05-01

Guest has been providing garden knowledge to readers for almost 30 years through her newspaper columns and has finally compiled some of the most common questions into one place. Geared towards the novice gardener, Guest's book is organized (or dis-organized!?) according to season and then, alphabetically. Despite some good basic (very basic) information, the book's lack of flow and sensible organization makes it a disaster to read or to use as a reference. Each &quot;season&quot; section contains varied information that may or may not pertain to that season, and some things appear more than once. For example, annual flowers are discussed under the Winter section because there is the briefest of paragraphs suggesting starting annual flower seeds in the winter, but an annual question also appears in the Spring section. Trying to follow alphabetically within the season is also futile since titles are inconsistent - some plants are discussed specifically while others are grouped together, etc. Thankfully it is fully indexed so you can get a quick look-up by subject. Information provided throughout the book is pretty mundane and something you will most likely know if you have been gardening for any amount of time. Guest's entire comment on daylily in the Spring section is: &quot;You can plant day lilies in the spring or fall since they tolerate a wide range of growing conditions. Some bloomers are better than others, such as 'Happy Returns', a compact 18-inch yellow variety that will bloom all summer long. It is a true yellow and will blend beautifully with other flowers.&quot; There is a longer comment on daylilies in the fall section - but there is no indication that the reader should look there for more detailed info. This book may be worthwhile afternoon scan (the library's copy, of course) but does not stand alone as a garden reference guide worthy of the avid gardener's shelf.	2002-04-16

The truth is, as we can learn from Mike Dash, that botanists introduced tulips to the Dutch after discovering them growing wild in the valleys and oases of the Pamir Mountains in Russia and the Tien Shan that border China. Out of these harsh mountains in Asia, tulips flourished and were held in high esteem by the Ottoman's and are considered sacred in the religion of Islam. By the 16th century, tulips were already being cultivated in Turkish gardens, and in the 1530s, it is rumored, Lopo Vaz de Sampayo brought the tulip to Western Europe for the first time. Over the span of another hundred years of discovery and cultivation, the tulips we know today as \\"Dutch\\" tulips were being sought after with vigor. Beautiful varieties (created, in part, by a mosaic virus) were being bought for a small fortune - and the most rare bulbs could command sums of several years' salary. More a book of incredible sociological and economic history than botanical information, Dash gives an interesting glimpse of the importance of taverns to the tulip trade and explains with detail that tulip mania is one of the earliest cases of futures trading. Although Dash's writing is occasionally repetitive, his study is a quick, easy and interesting read that can be enjoyed by anyone interested in the history of the Netherlands in the 17th century, gardening, economy or sociology.	2002-04-12

Stu Campbell is able to take what, to newcomers, can be a daunting task and not only present us with the basics to feel comfortable but he also translates some of the scientific &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot; of how and why compost works into layman's terms. He includes real &quot;recipes&quot; and approaches to try as well as suppling a list (though not nearly complete) of good materials to compost as well as what NOT to use. A short &quot;troubleshooting&quot; chapter called &quot;Things You Might Worry About a Little&quot; is a bit over the top for beginners but is part of what makes this book valuable for the seasoned composter. Let It Rot! is a not-to-technical, well-written, easy-to-read guide that takes the &quot;yuck&quot; out of your composting ideas! Perfect for beginners and a great refresher for near professional composters.	2002-04-08

Nothing makes a garden project book better than glossy photos and clear step-by-step instructions. The Living Wreath has both! This Martha (Stewart, that is) approved activity developed by Teddy Colbert, is an exciting way to look at &quot;container&quot; planting. Although the book sometimes seems to be a vehicle for promoting Teddy's living wreath products, including tools, materials and completed wreaths, her products are not necessary to create your own living wreath. Teddy's technique was created with succulent plant materials and the majority of the &quot;how-to&quot; section focuses on creating a succulent living wreath however, there are also inspirational examples of adaptions that include such creative ideas as a fresh herb &quot;clock&quot; for the kitchen, a living strawberry wreath, a fresh spring greens wreath (put it in the center of your dining table and let everyone &quot;pick&quot; their own salad!) plus several flowering wreaths with petunias and impatiens or a beautiful mix of flowering annuals. 50 wreaths are pictured in all.

This guide is the most detailed edible plant guide I have found and offers great &quot;extras&quot; like a quick key guide that allows you to identify if a plant is trail nibble, salad addition, cooked green, underground vegetable, fritter, raw fruit, cooked fruit, jams/jellies/sauces, syrup/sugar, candy, grain, nuts/seeds, flour/meal, hot beverage, cold beverage, pickle, seasoning, or thickener. The &quot;Poisonous look-alikes&quot; feature is an added attraction within each plant description and there is also an entire poisonous plant section so there will be no mistake that what you have found Mother Nature meant you to harvest. A fabulous handbook for gardeners, hikers, and cooks.	2002-04-08

I am surprised at other reviewiers taking offense to her descriptions of her hometown and her views - while I found Ms. Stapinski to be opinionated, I also found that she did an excellent job of maintaining an emotional distance from the &quot;story&quot;. I enjoyed peering into this life, with its stolen luxuries and potential for destruction - I don't imagine that this memoir is much different than what many others remember, or are experiencing now. While the book is not very cheerful, it is an  honest and poignant view of a memorable childhood. I recommend Five Finger Discout for both its historical interest and its unique ability to draw the reader into the world of petty crime and abuse and for its understanding of family dynamics and loyalties. Not everyone grew up in Mayberry!	2001-12-26

When I opened to the first page, I wanted it to be trite and boring and mundane. Why? Because somewhere in print I read that Goldberg didn't really want to write this - she wanted to get into something much more esoteric but was told she wouldn't get any readers unless she started more mainstream. I was insulted, and (being passive-aggressive) decided to read it (but I'm not buying it!) further spurred on by the NY Times reviews calling it &quot;fervidly intelligent&quot; and &quot;particularly original and intriguing.&quot; Then the Seattle Times called it a &quot;near perfect novel.&quot; C'mon now, how good could it be when she really didn't want to write it to begin with? Well, it could make me give it four stars in spite of myself. Goldberg is a careful writer, writing sentences in which each word has important implications - literal and symbolic. Words seem calculated - but not forced - and don't distract you from the intensity of the character's dysfunctional dynamics that uncoil themselves throughout the novel. The family's reluctant interdependency upon each other, both worldly and emotional, real and imagined, is incredibly insightful but never obvious. Goldberg is not insulting with her insights - the reader can find them provided that one is looking, and without having to be a literary scholar.  As the famly spins on its out of control trajectory towards the end of the book, I found myself second guessing their actions - wanting to try and predict the unpredictable - to make order out of the madness. Perhaps this was the author's intention all along? If so, she has led me down the path and I have followed blindly. And been pleased with what I've found at the end.  Since returning the library's copy, I have purchased my own copy to lend to others - this is a book worth getting others into. I have not enjoyed a book as much as this one in a long time. My only disappointment is that I can't imagine where Goldberg will go from here.	2000-10-30
