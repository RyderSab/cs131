(I guess my loss of interest says more about me than the subject matter.)  I took just under 6 months to read this book, ponder its meaning, and research scriptural and other sources to see if it is correct in its teachings.  And after spending a lifetime as a follower and admirer of the carpenter from Nazareth who is the Son of God, I can only say that this book did more for my understanding of the doctrine of the Atonement than any other book short of scripture.<br /><br />The writing is clear and concise.  The author has obviously distilled the study of a lifetime into this volume because it carries quotes from so many disparate sources that would have taken years to accumulate.  From his background as a lawyer, the author is uniquely qualified to discuss justice, mercy and other related concepts.  His main sources are scriptures - that is the Bible and also scriptures unique to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon).  C.S. Lewis and Joseph Smith are also two common sources.<br /><br />The 300 pages of this book contain chapters on why an atonement is needed, what is the nature of the atonement, what it means, and how it was accomplished.  The atonement is the central doctrine of Christianity and is so comprehensive and overwhelming in its scope that a guide such as this one is extrememly useful.<br /><br />And besides the high intellectual content of this work, I found myself pondering over and over again the particularized question, \\"Considering what a failure I am, how is it possible that a Savior could care enough for me to suffer and die for me?\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to anyone.	2005-10-10
US	51960978	R38BIO68BSQMAY	0140053204	690446916	Travels with Charley in Search of America	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Well-written, quick reading from Steinbeck in Autumn	This book covers the travels of John Steinbeck when he was 60 years old in the autumn of 1960.  Steinbeck gets a camper and drives from New York counter-clockwise around the country.<br /><br />His narrative moves rather quickly with only a few stops described in detail. Being a native Californian, his time there is one of the most complete parts of this account.<br /><br />I liked 2 things in particular about this book.  First, Steinbeck throws in occasional asides on some aspect of Amreican Culture that are incredibly incisive.  For example, he sums up modern American Literature as \\"sex, sadism and murder\\".  Take a look at the best-selling fiction table at your favorite bookstore and see if you can disagree.<br /><br />Second, Steinbeck picks and chooses only a poignant few occurrences of his trip to examine in depth.  For example, he spends time describing his account of watching bigots insult a little black girl who is escorted into a white school.  The same bigots insult even worse the white students who attend the school rather than boycott it.  This snapshot of American Culture is wonderfully described.<br /><br />Negatives of the book are that much of it is too brief to be meaningful.  Some parts are just a blur of travel.  This may be how it felt to Steinbeck, but I don't really want to spend time reading about it.<br /><br />Overall, there is a wistful, autumnal feel to the book.  Steinbeck doesn't come home finding anything other than gradual disappointment and a wish to be home with a few noteworthy exceptions.  Overall, an enjoyable, quick read with a few moments of thought-provoking introspection.  4 stars.	2005-09-30

His other two books are very entertaining, especially his first book on Borneo.  But this journey to the Congo turns away from nature, bumbling white-man in the jungle, and admiring the survival skills and personalities of the natives sort stuff, and turns into a book about a journey through hell-on-earth caused by the local people.<br /><br />The title \\"No Mercy\\" should give you a clue.  The book starts with O'Hanlon and his companion-du-jour, an American academic named Lary, as they try to plan a trip in the jungles of the Congo.  The usual 3rd world problems of bribing the corrupt government officials, avoiding getting killed and robbed, and finding local guides ensue.  Entertaining and normal.<br /><br />O'Hanlon hires the Congolese Minister of Nature or some such thing who brings along extended family members as workers.  Marcellin (the government minister), Nze, and Manou then take over the book.  The American provides needed sanity to the first part of the trip as they go up the river in a fetid, crowded steamboat and begin their travels.  Dead bodies float by frequently.  Murderous natives who mostly want to murder O'Hanlon's guides and night-time escapes from danger become more and more frequent.  Then O'Hanlon's companion has to leave and O'Hanlon is left at the mercy of his guides and Congolese society as he journeys to an isolated lake where reports of a Lochness-like creature abound.<br /><br />The book then gets deep into the psyche of the guides and their world of fetishes, witch-doctors, murder, jungle spirits, venereal diseases, slavery, promiscuous sex in every village, and constant attempts to wheedle money out of O'Hanlon.<br /><br />By the time you get to the end of this absorbing descent into hell, you feel nothing but despair.  Every aspect of this place is nasty.  The government indoctrinates and corrupts, the tribal leaders rob and bully, and even the extended family becomes a tool used by the alpha-male to plunder and subjugate the rest of the family.  Any resident at any time may irk the wrong people and end up being tortured and killed.  Men use women as they wish, taking extra wives or abandoning them on a whim.  Each group looks down on another group, and literal slavery is still very much alive in the Congo.<br /><br />This is really a great book, but it is not a light and entertaining read.  I recommend it highly but don't expect to leave \\"No Mercy\\" laughing and uplifted.despair.  Every aspect of this place is nasty.

No wild speculations here, so if that's what you're looking for, search elsewhere.  Most of the exegesis is based on scripture unique to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormon) so it might not be of interest to others (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price).<br /><br />But if you are interested, the author gives a quick overview of the covenant nature of this hemisphere (Serve the God of this land who is Jesus Christ or be swept off).  He points out that this same covenant relationship has existed here since the beginning.  The Adamic civilization was removed via the flood after the righteous had been saved through the Prophet Enoch.  Then the Jaredites went through several cycles before they too were destroyed.  Then the Nephites.<br /><br />The author explains the reason the Lamanites were partly spared.  Then he discusses the current dispensation.  He ends with current prophet's views and why we should be optimistic.  This book does not dwell on all the cataclysms expected before the Second Coming, but rather on why and how there is reason for optimism regarding this nation.  Lots of quotes from Ezra Taft Benson as you might expect.<br /><br />Now just 2 criticisms.  First, the visions of Wilford Woodruff and the like are not mentioned.  These accounts are not quite so pollyanna-ish but are needed for a fuller picture of upcoming events.  And second, the idea of a covenant relationship is not at all solely an idea of the LDS church alone.  Many of America's early Christians espoused this idea.  The Mayflower Compact and the whole Puritan movement in this country were covenantal relationships.  Many other similar groups from the Dutch to the Manifest Destiny believers also accepted this covenant idea.<br /><br />Overall, upbeat and enjoyable with the single best contribution of this book being what ripening in destruction means, and what exactly determines a civilization being fully ripe (society casts out the righteous).rall, upbeat and enjoyable with the single best contribution of this book being what ripening in destruction means, and what exactly determines a civilization being fully ripe (society casts out the righteous).	2005-08-20

As I reread this book, I kept finding ideas that were eerily modern.  Leopold talked of preserving Arctic areas.  He talked of roadless wilderness.  He discussed the ethic of placing nature first, at least some of the time, even if it meant that humans wouldn't see or benefit in any economic way.  This work was one of the earliest environmental books, written when there were very few others.<br /><br />The first part is a month-by-month account of nature in Wisconsin.  Leopold discusses natural history, hunting, land use policy, and other similar aspects throughout a year.  Then there are several short essays on various similar subjects.<br /><br />Leopold is an adequate author, but it is not his prose that sets him apart.  (This is the reason for 3 stars)  His ideas are profound and influential.  Reading this book now will not seem as exciting as reading it 40 years ago when his ideas were not as generally accepted.<br /><br />Another criticism is that Leopold seems rather full of himself.  Conservation and land ethics had been around for quite a while by then, and Leopold never mentions Theodore Roosevelt, John Wesley Powell, Gifford Pinchot, or John Muir.  Leopold owed a debt to these earlier conservationists that he never acknowledges in this book.  Reading the book would leave you believing that all this conservation stuff never crossed any other human's mind until Leopold thought of it.<br /><br />This book is not for sitting down and reading all the way through.  I suspect that if you do this you will be soon nodding off.  But if you read a chapter here and there from time to time, and think about the ideas expressed, you will be well served.<br /><br />So, overall, a book of important ideas written in less than exciting form.	2005-08-17

It was first published in the early 1900's and has been republished multiple times since.  All of the versions, variously titled \\"The White Indian Boy\\", \\"Uncle Nick among the Shoshones\\", or \\"Among the Shoshones\\" have the same text and pictures.  For many years it was required reading in the Intermountain West during Elementary or Secondary School.  Whenever I give a copy to someone, many of them remember loving this book when they first read it or had it read to them by a teacher 50 or more years ago.<br /><br />It really is that good.  The tales are direct, simple and entertaining.  You will remember them 50 years later just like all of those who have read it before.<br /><br />Nick Wilson ran away from his Utah pioneer home in the 1850's, soon after Utah received its first settlers.  The mother of Chief Washakie, a prominent Shoshone chief, had lost her 2 other sons and dreamed they would be replaced by a white boy.  Nick was an 11 year old who spent his days herding sheep, working on a farm and living on \\"lumpy dick\\" and \\"greens\\", which are just as good as they sound.  He had a facility for languages and had picked up Goshiute from an Indian Boy who was his childhood friend.  When Shoshone Indians heard him speaking an Indian language, they offered him a pony, adventure, venison and grouse and, best of all, no tiring farmwork.<br /><br />He left without a word to anyone and spent 2 years with the Shoshone as they wandered over Idaho, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.  He learned Shoshone quickly and learned Indian skills.  He hunted, travelled and participated fully in Indian life.  He shot arrows at grizzly bears, gathered serviceberries and was an eyewitness of a large Indian battle between the Crow and Shoshone.  He met Indians who knew Lewis and Clark.<br /><br />The book also includes later adventures as a trapper, original Pony Express rider, Army Scout, and many other adventures.  General Albert Sydney Johnson of Civil War fame was so enamored of his skills that he tried to talk Nick into going to the Civil War with him.  Kit Carson spent a winter at his cabin.  Nick was even shot in the head with an arrow and left to die.<br /><br />This is the authentic article, well-told and gripping.  The last year of his life, Nick Wilson was bedridden and his mind began to wander.  He never spoke another word of English and spoke only Shoshone until his death.  He recognized the faults of his Indian brothers but loved them dearly and wasn't afraid to say that the faults were mostly on the side of the white man.<br /><br />Recommended highly.er adventures.

This book is about 2 subject areas, really.  First, field biology, population genetics and research on birds in the Galapagos Islands.<br /><br />The author gives an in-depth look into research done by two biologists named the Grants and their graduate students over many years in the Galapagos islands.  He interviews, follows and discusses the Grants.  He also explains a lot of their work and what it means in a general ecological sense.  For example, lots of this book concerns measuring bird's beaks and how they change over time as conditions also change over time.<br /><br />This part of the book may lose the average reader and page after page of bird beak information may not thrill everyone.  If this kind of stuff isn't your cup of tea, then give this book a pass.  I, personally, found the great detail fascinating and necessary to really get at what the Grants work is all about.<br /><br />From a literary point of view, there is only so much you can do with bird beaks and that Weiner makes this reading as rewarding and interesting as he does is commendable.<br /><br />From a scientific point-of-view the Grant's work is observational and their work is limited by these constraints; That is, their work is not really experimental.  A good null hypothesis comparing data needs to have some single factor manipulated in a controlled way to yield the best data.  Now I know you can't really do that in a natural ecosystem, doing something like removing all the seeds of a certain type and see if the beak changes in the predicted manner.  But you can do this on a small scale in the laboratory and the Grants have not done this.  This lack is why their work, although painstaking and excellent, is not that earthshaking.  Their research is usually pigeon-holed in a little niche and not something that makes its way into the average college ecology text.<br /><br />The author does a creditable job for a layman in describing field research and ecological concepts.  Ideas like competition, predation, selection, gene pools and the like are really best described using complex mathematics involving the calculus, matrices, and statistical models, so being able to understand what the heck the Grants are getting at is a coup for the author.<br /><br />The second subject area is gradually included in the book and then the book shifts character and ends with an unscientific defense of something vaguely referred to as evolution.(Thus, the title \\"A story of evolution in our time\\") Weiner mixes up several concepts and includes them all under a charged word that means different things to different people, as you can see from the reviews already here.<br /><br />This book does a great job in describing field work and specific observations regarding selection in response to pressures like change in rainfall.  It does not do a good job supporting evolution- In part, because the author never adequately defines what he means when he says the word \\"evolution\\".  Do the data show that bird beaks change over time?  Yes.  Do they demonstrate what drives this change?  Only in part, because correlation is not the same as causality.<br /><br />Then you come to the concept of evolution.  I take it that Weiner means everything from adaptation and organic evolution theories stating that all life started from changes in the primordial soup to atheism.  These are not at all the same topic and Weiner fails completely to explain this.  Since the reader never knows what exactly Weiner is defending, the last part of the book where some of the scientists involved dis others due to religion or being a member of some religious group that, it is implied, feels differently is head-scratchingly vague and out of place.<br /><br />The bird's beaks grow, shrink, thicken and thin back and forth and in the end there is really no major change.  So do the data prove \\"evolution\\"?  No, they do not.  So if you're looking for a defense of your zealously held political beliefs regarding \\"evolution\\"  you should read elsewhere.  And if you read the bibliography and are outraged that there are no articles \\"proving\\" creationism to balance the other articles, you need to realize that this is really not the purpose of this book.  Unfortunately, the author never realized this and thus the imprecise title that leads you away from what this book really should be.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent layman's book on biology and some basic concepts like natural selection and competition.  It also is excellent in portraying field biology and those who work in the field.  But it fails completely to explain what \\"evolution in our time\\" means and implies.  Three stars.tical beliefs regarding \\"evolution\\"  you should read elsewhere.

He responds to the inane, thoughtless chant of \\"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western Civ has got to go\\" with an impassioned and well-reasoned defense of Western Civilization's basic literary works.  After this intro, the book then talks of 26 authors and their works.  Other than the occasional disparaging remark against some anti-western bigot, he concentrates on these 26 authors.  This book isn't a political rant and any reviewer who thinks it is only read the first 40 pages.<br /><br />Bloom concentrates on the authors of the canon and their message rather than the works of the canon themselves.  He may dwell on an obscure work; for example, Tolstoy's \\"Hadji Murad\\" rather than \\"War and Peace\\" or Woolf's \\"Orlando\\" rather than \\"To the Lighthouse\\".  His sentences are often dense and take for granted a knowledge of various critics over the centuries and the entire opus of a given author.  Since I don't know this information in some cases, I had a hard time following some of his points.  Nonetheless, his passion for these works led me to wish to read those I hadn't read and read again those I had.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I do not agree with all Bloom says, nor would anyone, I suspect.  How could you leave Yeats, Frost, and Twain out and include Dickinson, Woolf, Freud, and Neruda?  But it's fun to be outraged at who he includes and who he doesn't.<br /><br />His 26 authors are Shakespeare, Dante, Chaucer, Cervantes, Montaigne, Moliere, Milton, Johnson, Goethe, Wordsworth, Austen, Whitman, Dickinson, Dickens, Eliot, Tolstoy, Ibsen, Freud, Proust, Joyce, Woolf, Kafka, Borges, Neruda, Pessoa, and Beckett.  He also includes a list of other essential authors and their necessary works at the back that is breath-takingly diverse and useful.  Reviewers who complain of exclusiveness are way off mark.  Bloom includes women, Latin American, European and many non-English-speaking authors.<br /><br />Bloom says canonical works must be \\"authentic\\" and \\"strange\\", meaning true to some unstated principle of value and unique.<br /><br />Now, a few words about politics and this book.  There really isn't much political thought in it.  Bloom briefly decries the loss of these works but he disparages equally the Marxist left and the Christian right.  This book is about authors and their works and not politics and anyone who says otherwise is wrong.<br /><br />And lastly, a few criticisms of this ultimate work of criticism.  How could Twain be left out?  And how could he include Woolf who wrote some of the worst literature I've ever been forced to read? And how could he include Neruda, the author who praised mass-murderers like Stalin and turned over leftists who weren't Communist enough to suit him to the fascists when he was a diplomat in Spain before World War II?  And where are the Brazilians like Machado do Assis?  They don't even make his lists at the back of the book.  And his praise of Joyce's later works like the unintelligible \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"?  I fear Bloom the polymath makes the intellectual error of mistaking obscurity for profundity.<br /><br />All-in-all, four stars for making me want to read more than ever works I have missed.in of exclusiveness are way off mark.

Theroux does notice the beauty of the region but doesn't overdo it.  (A dusty, barren plain is just a dusty, barren plain in the end, and it is egregious to pretend to find every landscape beautiful in some way - if you only have the spiritual depth to see it.)<br /><br />Theroux writes clearly and well.  He says what he means and means what he says, a trait lacking in many Pollyanna-ish travel writings.  The title says it all - that this region is a blighted area of earth.  Theroux is uniquely qualified to write this book because he speaks some of the languages, lived here as a Peace Corps volunteer, is well-read, and fearless in where he goes and how he gets there.  You may disagree with some of his views, but it is ridiculous to say he doesn't know anything about the area.<br /><br />If you haven't read Theroux, realize that he has a few themes he emphasizes.  One is he doesn't like religion much.  Theroux is full of admiration for the Nun, the Missionary Physician, and others in this book.  He is also relentlessly negative in his antipathy to religious doctrines and missionaries who spend their time doing religious activities rather than humanitarian activities.  This, of course, leads to the paradox of aiding a place like this.  How exactly does one help a people who have sex so liberally and have incredibly high populations with AIDS if you can't tell them to be monogamous and faithful?  And when Theroux mentions that prostitution is one of the only ways out for women, how exactly can getting AIDS be considered getting \\"out\\"?  And so it is easy to get offended by Theroux's faulty and fuzzy reasoning.  And yet, he has something to say that should be thought about.<br /><br />Theroux is also the classic curmudgeon.  He just plain doesn't like people that much - at least his writings look that way.  Theroux doesn't even like himelf that much when he makes remarks about where he got his first case of the clap and the like.  Again, this may be the more accurate representation of people in the area.  If everyone was great and noble in the world, it wouldn't be such a screwed-up place.<br /><br />One of the lynch-pins of this book is an encounter Theroux has with some African minister of something or other.  The minister recognizes all the problems of his country and then tells the author that he (Theroux) should send his children to help.  Basically, the minister is saying that us Europeans and North Americans should send more aid, personnel, etc.  The minister's children are all in the US earning advanced degrees financed by the aid money sent to Africa.  The minister's children have no intention of returning home and have never even considered helping or sending aid back to their own country.  Theroux points out that the minister's children are the ones who should be helping, not Theroux's children.  Where are the black doctors running missions after being trained in the West?  The minister makes no answer.  Hypocrisy exudes from every official Theroux comes in contact with and it would be hard not to be negative after a while.<br /><br />Theroux also points out the ignorant aid workers in their new Land Rovers and that all the aid for all these years has not helped a bit.  It has only entrenched a powerful elite who exclude the rest of the population.  Aid can cause as many problems as it fixes.  Author P.J. O'Rourke pointed out how free grain sent to Somalia was stolen by the warlords and sold cheaper than the native farmers could grow it.  The farmers couldn't sell their crops for a profit and so abandoned the land.  So the aid really only hurt the future of food production in the country.  It isn't as easy as it seems and reviewers who criticize Theroux for pointing this out are really only showing their failure to ask hard questions.  Yes, Theroux may have a point about aid harming Africa.  Wouldn't you want your own sonto earn his own way, rather than receive a welfare check?<br /><br />By the end of the book, you can't help but be discouraged as Theroux's bags are stolen in South Africa and he sees racism, bigotry and exploitation of white farmers in Zimbabwe and South Africa.  And after the white farmers are murdered and driven out, exactly who will take their place when marauding gangs of thugs steal what they want and there is no point amassing savings or property if it will just be stolen by the government because you have something?<br /><br />Theroux occasionally gets facts wrong.  He gets geography a little wrong, or some political or religious fact.  But not that often.<br /><br />Overall this was a hair-raising adventure with enough deep questions to keep you thinking for a long time to come.  I recommend it heartily.r own son to earn his own way, rather than receive a welfare check?   <br /> <br />By the end of the book, you can't help but be discouraged as Theroux's bags are stolen in South Africa and he sees racism, bigotry and exploitation of white farmers in Zimbabwe and South Africa.

The author had spent some years in Alaska years before and built a cabin in the bush with his then wife.  10 years later, he returned to the North, recently divorced and went from Whitehorse in the Yukon Territory Canada, west across Alaska to the mouth of the Yukon River in the Bering Sea.<br /><br />This book is not a mile-by-mile description of landscape and campsites.  Rather it mostly concerns the current inhabitants of the area and the history of the area.  It is well-written and does not contain any \\"world's greatest\\" claims.  (You know, the claims in many travel books that a certain place is the prettiest, biggest, greenest, or ugliest place in the world.)  Such honesty is refreshing.<br /><br />Having spent one summer on the upper Yukon in Canada and parts of other years, I can tell you this book catches the ambience of the area perfectly - from the Indians (now called \\"first nations\\" in Canada in PC talk) to the miners to the malcontents trying to get away from it all.  I found it wonderfully evocative and representative of the people who live up there.  If you've ever read Robert Service's \\"Spell of the Yukon\\" you will understand when I say this work is a book-length treatment of the same subject - the strange lure of the North.<br /><br />I'll close with a couple of excerpts from Service that will give you a sense of the place and the book.<br /><br />  \\"No, There's the land, Have you seen it?<br /><br />  It's the cussedest land that I know,<br /><br />  From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it<br /><br />  To the deep, deathlike valleys below.<br /><br />  Some say God was tired when he made it -<br /><br />  Some say it's a fine land to shun.<br /><br />  Maybe, but there's some as would trade it<br /><br />  For no land on earth, and I'm one.<br /><br />  It grips you like some kinds of sinning,<br /><br />  It twists you from foe to a friend,<br /><br />  It seems it's been since the beginning,<br /><br />  It seems it will be to the end.<br /><br />  There's a land where the mountains are nameless,<br /><br />  And the rivers all run God knows where.<br /><br />  There are lives that are erring and aimless,<br /><br />  And deaths that just hang by a hair.<br /><br />There are hardships that nobody reckons,<br /><br />There are valleys unpeopled and still.<br /><br />There's a land, oh it beckons and beckons.<br /><br />And I want to go back and I will\\"<br /><br />Read this if you've ever felt the urge to go North and you'll get a feel for it.friend, <br />       It seems it's been since the beginning, <br />       It seems it will be to the end. <br /> <br />       There's a land where the mountains are nameless, <br />       And the rivers all run God knows where. <br />       There are lives that are erring and aimless, <br />       And deaths that just hang by a hair. <br />There are hardships that nobody reckons, <br />There are valleys unpeopled and still. <br />There's a land, oh it beckons and beckons. <br />And I want to go back and I will\\" <br /> <br />Read this if you've ever felt the urge to go North and you'll get a feel for it. <br />	2005-06-03

He does this by beginning with Homer and then includes chapters on art, politics, expression, war and other topics, showing the influence of Greeks.  This is not encyclopedic history.  Many important events are not covered or are mentioned cusorily.  But, at the end of the book you are left with an overall sense of wonder at the Greeks and a desire to know more.  And exactly what more could you ask for in a small book on an ancient and foreign culture?<br /><br />Strengths of this book are the overall gestalt left by the author.  He includes complete texts like Pericles funeral oration and many smaller fragments of other works illustrative of some aspect of the Greeks.  His selections, while necessarily limited to keep the book short, are simply wonderful.  His take on various works may be debated, but then so what?  This makes for interesting reading and thinking, and isn't that why we read?  Take for example Homer's Iliad.  Cahill sees it as pointing out the nastiness of war.  You may disagree but if you have ever read the whole Iliad (and not just the excerpts in your survey of literature textbook) I don't know how you could come away with any other view.  (That the Greeks may have viewed this differently is open to debate)  Chapter after chapter of Greeks and Trojans murdering each other most graphically and then robbing the body of its armor.  Page after page of limbs hacked off, blood spurting and spears through various body parts in great detail leaves you numbed in the end.  Petty fights over who gets to rape the captured women first and who gets the best seat at the table go on and on.  How could anyone interpret this work otherwise would be more my question than why Cahill interprets the Iliad this way.<br /><br />I admit I would tear out a few of the pages of pictures of homo-erotic art, but Cahill always includes sexuality in his books.  His first \\"Hinges of History\\" book \\"How the Irish saved Civilization\\" (a better book, in my opinion) left me with the impression that Cahill wished to see Irish Kings copulate with white mares in public once again, just like in the good old days.  Ignore these parts and enjoy the rest and you will be well served.<br /><br />Cahill also juxtaposes ancient history with modern politics and war.  You may feel that Cahill disparages the current political leaders.  So what?  Read and think anyway and you will still be well-served.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent overview and will serve to pique your interest in a neglected area of education.  It will also be informative and opinionated.  Can't wait to see what Cahill writes next..

I thoroughly enjoyed reading the editor's introduction and these poems of a Pulitzer-Prize-winning poet.  They are well selected and represent the entire span of Berryman's work unlike some other collections that lack some of the author's books.  My favorite poems are his early poems up to his famous \\"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet\\" and his late poems that have lost much of his egotism and drip with regret, humility, and hope of a better life.<br /><br />A knowledge of Berryman's life is requisite to understand most of his poetry.  His father committed suicide when the author was just a boy.  Berryman was promptly adopted, given a new last name - Berryman, and sent to a boarding school by his mother and new stepfather - the man with whom his mother was having an affair at the time of his father's suicide.  Berryman himself committed suicide at age 57 after years of problems from divorce to alcholism.  The editor, Kevin Young, gives a great overview of Berryman's life and allows the reader of these poems the knowledge necessary to enjoy them fully.  I think a reader would be lost much of the time without the introduction, so I definitely recommend this particular edition.<br /><br />His early poems are about the struggle for adulthood.  Here is a representative excerpt.<br /><br />  \\"He is learning, well behind his deperate eyes,<br /><br />  The epistemology of loss, how to stand up<br /><br />  Knowing what every man must one day know<br /><br />  And most know many days, how to stand up\\"<br /><br />The influence of Auden, Yeats, Eliot and others are evident.  Take these lines:<br /><br />  \\"The time is coming near<br /><br />  When none shall have books or music, none his dear,<br /><br />  And only a fool will speak aloud his mind.<br /><br />  History is approaching a speechless end\\"<br /><br />You could easily place these lines in the middle of Yeats' Second Coming.<br /><br />There is an undeniable religiosity in Berryman's work from the earliest to the latest poems.  Lines like \\"Finish, Lord, in me this work thou hast begun\\" are as autobiographical as they are biographical.  In one of his last poems he notes, \\"I do not understand; but I believe\\".<br /><br />His middle poems are wildly unpredictable and unconventional.  Some are pithy, others whimsical, and still others offensive.  Who can not be charmed by a poet who notes, \\"Life, friends, is boring.\\"<br /><br />All in all, a great American poet, in a great collection with a great foreword and editor.  Four stars.from the earliest to the latest poems.  Lines like \\"Finish, Lord, in me this work thou hast begun\\" are as autobiographical as they are biographical.

His book \\"A Time of Gifts\\" about his travels in the 1930's across Europe mostly walking was what got me interested in travel writing in the first place.  And \\"A TIme of Gifts\\" is still the best travel book I have ever read.<br /><br />This is not his best, though since it is Fermor, it is still very, very good.  One of the problems is that Fermor is travelling to check off places visited.  There is a little of the \\"If it's Tuesday, I must be in Belgium\\" frame of mind.  Too many islands, in too little time.  There are excellent descriptions of a few things like the history of some of the islands and voodoo.  But this book lacks the depth of \\"A Time of Gifts\\" or \\"Between the Woods and the Water\\".<br /><br />Also, Fermor is travelling with companions rather than alone like the above books.  This means that he doesn't meet and get intimately acquainted with the people in the places he visits.  When you are travelling with people, you converse with them and bounce ideas off of them rather than the strangers you come in contact with.  And the interesting person who might invite you to his home if you were alone won't if you are with a group.<br /><br />Part of the problem lies with the Caribbean islands themselves.  This was a time when there were no cruise ships, tourism or Club Meds.  Also, World War II had meant years of no involvement with the wider world.<br /><br />Anyway, this book read slowly and was not as insightful as Fermor's other books, and I really did not find much other than the history that really seemed to have anything to do with the Caribbean islands I have experienced.	2005-05-13

Chandler is arguably the best detective story writer out there.  If you expand this genre to all mystery writers, he would still be one of the best.<br /><br />Detective stories aren't as common as they once were, but if you look at the offspring of the Pulp magazine once so popular, television, they are still as popular as ever.  Chandler was one author who defined what a detective story was.  This book contains four novels:The Lady in the Lake, The Little Sister, The Long Goodbye, and Playback.  These are wonderfully entertaining stories that contain the archetypical hard-bitten detective, Philip Marlowe.  After reading these stories you will forever see Marlowe in every detective story you see or read, from Magnum to the latest TV cop.  How can you not love an author who sums up Modern American Capitalism with lines like these? \\"We make the finest packages in the world, Mr. Marlowe.  The stuff inside is mostly junk.\\"  Or an author who in the early 50's, (50 years before the current 'Queers Dress Up' shows) so presciently wrote, \\"The queer is the artistic arbiter of our age, chum.\\" Or his comment on a speech by a politician, \\"He did not bore us with any facts.\\"<br /><br />These books are not just riveting, fun reading, but full of thoughtful quotes like the above.<br /><br />Chandler also is must-reading for his understanding of criminality, venality, human nature, Southern California, Movies, American culture and American relationship dynamics.  I hate to use the word \\"classic\\" to describe stories that are just so plain fun to read, but I find it hard not to.<br /><br />This volume also contains a screenplay, Double Indemnity, and a few essays and letters.  The essays \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\", and \\"Writers in Hollywood\\" should be required reading for anyone interested in 20th century culture, movies, and literature. Just a few tidbits more.  Chandler on English Mystery Writers - \\"The English may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers.\\" Chandler on boredom - \\"There are no dull subjects, only dull minds.\\"  Chandler on critics - \\"The average critic never recognizes an achievement when it happens.  He explains it after it has become respectable.\\"<br /><br />My only criticism is that the plots are contrived and sometimes complicated.  But such criticism is like complaining that the Mona Lisa would be a fine painting if only it were of a different size.<br /><br />Chandler is simply wonderful, funny, cynical, and yes, - respectable.rably the best dull writers.\\" Chandler on boredom - \\"There are no dull subjects, only dull minds.\\"  Chandler on critics - \\"The average critic never recognizes an achievement when it happens.

The subtitle of this book, \\"Travels in the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Caucusus\\" lets you know which countries are covered.  It was written in 2000 and misses things like the latest NATO countries.  However, these places are showing up more and more often in the news.<br /><br />Take the Middle East and Syria for example.  Syria has all kinds of things going on with their disputed withdrawal from Lebanon.  This book gives you a first-hand account of Syria, its people and history of the last century.  Understanding of this region is not just a cursory view of Islam, Shiites and Sunnis.  Who'd have thunk Iraq would pick a Sunni Prime Minister for example?<br /><br />And Israel and Turkey continue to play large regional roles.  Turkey is a complicated country that has been kept more or less in line by its military which seems to be tiring of the task.  What happens in such countries is illustrated by places like Brasil and Argentina where now that the military has stopped being so involved, Marxist terrorists are elected as head of the country.  Scary stuff.<br /><br />This book contains excellent information on the \\"Stans\\" - countries ending in 'stan'.  They are also making the news daily with revolts and resignations of leaders.  The US is investing huge amounts in this region and building what seem to be permanent military bases.  Ask some military friends what they know about these bases.  You'll be surprised how many have been there or know someone who's been there.  Why?  Better read this book.  And new sources of oil and US$55.00/barrel oil prices are not all that is going on.<br /><br />The sections on the Balkans are also wonderful history-based observations of an area in rapid change, mostly ignored by the average American.<br /><br />I could go on and on citing the importance of information in this book.  One of the main themes to me is that Democracy is not necessarily a panacea for all that's wrong in the world.  In fact, our own founding fathers thought democracy was one of the worst forms of government.  That's why we're not a democracy - we're a republic.  This book points out that democracy without a people suited to this and a Constitution to guard against its excesses does not work.<br /><br />Excellent overview with a solid historical background of an increasingly important area of the world.athers thought democracy was one of the worst forms of government.

(I won't even use the word \\"ending\\".)  The topics and social commentary of the book are the purpose of this book - not its plot or dialogue.<br /><br />If you haven't read Wolfe, this book is full of what he does best - set-pieces.  His descriptions of a situation and the people in them are so penetrating, amusing and apt that you will feel like time is rushing by as you read.  The depiction of Conrad in a California prison is so scary and real that many have wondered where Wolfe did his sentence.  And Croker at the art exhibition, wondering out loud just why pictures of people engaged in various disgusting homo-erotic poses is being fobbed off as avant-garde art, is priceless.<br /><br />Wolfe also does a great job of presenting characters that,  although imperfect, suck you into their world and find you hoping they can hold out against the godless forces of modern culture around them.  And with over 1000 pages, you should expect in-depth development.<br /><br />One of the apparent themes of this book is that 2 of the primary characters use the philosophy of Stoicism as their guide to living a worthy life.  This is simply a metaphor for Christianity presented so as not to detract from the social commentary.  Don't get hung up on why Stoicism seems to play such a role.<br /><br />This book also does an incredible job of detailing Atlanta and Southern politics.  You'll receive an excellent grounding in the politics of race and dependence through reading this.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful, thought-provoking novel that damns the current culture to the oblivion it so richly deserves and seeks.	2005-02-23

They get hung up on what brand of jeans they wear at their school and what music their \\"cool\\" group listens to.  They completely lack the perspective to see what Wolfe is getting at - our best and brightest have been surrendered to a system that is anarchy intent only on drugs, sex, and sporting and popular culture.<br /><br />Some have criticized the amount of play sports are given in the novel.  In many colleges, the first and often only thing out of the mouth of many students (if you can find one sober on a Friday night) is the current state of the sports team active at that time of the year.  Every year, colleges from Washington and Lee (Wolfe's alma mater and a top-10 party school) to BYU (stone-cold sober top 10) have their current crop of athletes-gone-wild who are cheating in school, raping co-eds, and getting caught driving while on drugs.  Wolfe also nails the attitudes and thinking of many athletes and athletic programs.  Sure, there are exceptions, but not as many as you think.<br /><br />And the emphasis on drinking and sex is right on target.  I recently attended an Illinois/Michigan football game with a nephew.  I crashed in his student apartment and then walked to the game Saturday AM.  The streets were littered with used condoms, empty alcohol bottles, half-naked students covered with vomit, and expensive SUV's parked crazily.  Being of bookish bent, I swung by the library and found this beautiful facility as quiet as a tombstone - and as empty as the alcohol bottles in the stadium parking lot.  Watch some spring break program on TV or rent girls-gone-wild (which I swear I have never done) and you will get the picture.<br /><br />Wolfe also hits a home-run (See, I told you sports pervades our culture) with his portrayal of pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who posture and pretend that their foul behavior is justified because they are so much better than the rest of the herd.  And many of them seek just as hard as the jocks to be drunk, laid, and admired and feared by everyone else.  Wolfe enjoys skewering these people.  I must admit I enjoy the occasional joust with half-witted Marxist feminists just for kicks myself.  (I'll bet you didn't know that Marx viewed females as nothing more than prostitutes.  Ask what that means to the next Marxist feminist you encounter and watch them go ballistic.  Offer them 10 dollars and watch them really go ballistic.)<br /><br />The co-ed dorm life is also accurate.  18 year olds are too stupid to see that you really don't want to share bathrooms with the opposite sex.  You don't really want to share a bathroom at all, come to think of it.  Those of us who are veterans will recall how much fun it was sitting on a row of 10 cut-out plywood holes knee to knee with 10 others during the few minutes between reveille and the time to report.  Why any fool would purposely seek such a situation with the opposite sex demonstrates that 18 year olds should have no say whatsoever in their housing arrangements.<br /><br />Charlotte is not the perfect heroine and lots of her thinking is shallow and selfish, just like all of us at sometime in our younger years.  Her sexual encounter is not the point of this book.  The point is learning what kind of a world exists in college and compromising with this world and her previous search for a \\"life of the mind\\" (as the author puts it).<br /><br />This book is not for anyone younger than 35 due to the graphic and repetitive language.  On second thought, make it 45. This patois of profanity is all too prevalent, even in our junior-high and high schools.<br /><br />The ending does not really wrap up anything, but is consistent with Wolfe's recent endings. Wolfe leaves to us to supply the ending and meaning of it all.  And when you finish reading this book, you may well break out in a sweat when you realize your children have sent their SAT's to all 10 of the top party schools.of them seek just as hard as the jocks to be drunk, laid, and admired and feared by everyone else.

US	51960978	R26LEF6EOAADZC	1883011876	922851659	2: Tennessee Williams: Plays 1957-1980 (Library of America)	Books	2	26	137	N	N	Grimy and one-dimensional.	Tennessee Williams was familiar to me only as the name behind some movies adapted from his plays and a fairly frequent mention in some literature/drama classes from college.  I recently read his collected works in these 2 volumes from the excellent Library of America series and his plays are totally different in tone and content than his movies which have been adapted, cleaned up and given happier endings.<br /><br />So here are my impressions.  First, Williams' range is extremely limited with almost all his plays based on the grossest immorality and exploitation.  In one essay entitled \\"Something Wild\\", Williams admitted his purpose was for a play to be a \\"punch to the solar plexus\\".  In other words, he aims to offend people.  (In today's PC-speak, it is called making the public \\"think\\" - but it still comes out the same.)<br /><br />Most of Williams' plays are autobiographical so they involve dysfunctional families, drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, and sexual exploitation and perversions ranging from pedophilia to homosexual behavior.

US	51960978	R11L2S2TLH4KAH	0879058439	996119057	New Genesis: A Mormon Reader on Land and Community	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Interesting and occasionally profound	Overall, this book is a collection of essays having something to do with the environment and the Church of Jesus Christ (Mormon).  If you're not Mormon you won't get a lot of the allusions to religion.  However, there are plenty of essays mostly on environment or how family, community, and spirituality are tied up with environment.<br /><br />Some of the essays are from critics of the Mormon church and some may be put off by these essays.  Many of the essays are from Mormon authorities like Vaughn Featherstone or High Pinnock.  Quite a few Utah politicians write about environment also.<br /><br />The essays are quite uneven.  Some are deeply intellectual;others are emotional.  A few times I finished and essay and wondered what I had just read.  But usually I finished an essay with a greater appreciation of this beautiful world we live in.<br /><br />If I had to give a theme to this book it would be stewardship - that is, the idea that God gave us this beautiful world to care for and not to destroy and abuse.  And as I watch the Utah I knew and loved turn into tract housing and fill with cars and people and smog, I think that many of us are not being wise stewards.<br /><br />One criticism would be not including any conservative viewpoints.  Congressman Hansen or Bishop ought to be in here.  And writers who live on the land like ranchers, miners and the like.  They too have a land ethic and excluding them so completely leaves a large gap.<br /><br />In general, I commend the editors Terry Williams (Author of Refuge), William Smart (former Deseret News editor), and publisher Gibbs Smith.	2005-01-11

Middle-aged banker runs off with wild old aunt from Europe to South America.<br /><br />Several aspects of this book make it worth while.  First of all, it really is funny.  Second, the accounts of interactions of the main characters with government and custom agents are really satirically true.<br /><br />Negatives are that the plot and ending are shallow and contrived.<br /><br />All in all, you could find lots worse books to read for amusement.	2004-12-22

The book is aimed at that audience and uses as the basis of this exposition Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants (Mormon scripture).  So if you will be offended by this, the book is not for you.  That said, the author is a talented scholar who writes this like a Stephen Covey book on management principles.  And by the way, the author is the son of apostle L. Tom Perry and wrote the words to the sacrament hymn \\"As now we take the Sacrament\\".<br /><br />I made a page of notes and quotes to use from this book and it is only a little over 100 pages.  The author uses diverse sources from  CS Lewis to management gurus.  I especially appreciate the personal stories and stories he learned from others in his extensive church service.  His background as a Business Management Professor molds this work into a kind of leadership handbook.<br /><br />Overall, I expanded my understanding of leadership principles, section 121, and the position of the Savior more from this book than most other \\"church\\" books I have read.  I especially recommend it for anyone in Priesthood leadership positions.	2004-12-22

He was a scholar with enyclopedic knowledge of other Protestant literature, biblical languages (especially Greek), and the geography of Palestine.  He was also an eloquent author.  Put all of this together and this is the best book on Christ (other than the New Testament itself) I have ever read.  This book is replete with footnotes and explanatory texts for those who wish to delve deeper into other works or the original Greek.  But for a layman like me, I still can enjoy the book and learn more depth on the subject.<br /><br />And though a scholar of the first rank, Farrar is a believer first and foremost who accepts the literalness of the Bible, resurrection, and the divinity of Christ, things which are lacking in way too many \\"scholars\\".  I've read many books on Christ and this is the one I recommend to friends.	2004-12-13

This is a pretty short book that is a pretty good introduction to Marxism or Communism.(And yes, Marxism and Communism are different.) Marx wrote lots of stuff and this is just an introduction.  Marx's famous quotes like \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\" and \\"Religion is the opiate of the masses\\"  are NOT in this book.<br /><br />Why then is it a good introduction?  Because it is self-contradictory and full of nasty generalizations and insults to everyone who thinks differently than the authors.  And this is the essence of Marxism.  With no one to hate, there is no Marxism and no proletariat to manipulate for your own selfish ends.  There is no forgiveness nor understanding in Marxism. Toleration consists of believing and doing what you are told with nary a doubt or thought that maybe the other fellow might have a point-of-view worth examining. Absolute truth is relative to the needs of the fascist who is promulgating these truths.<br /><br />One particularly nasty aspect of the book is the misogyny of Marx.  He basically sees the role of women as prostitutes.  I find it interesting that none of the Marxist reviewers mention this.<br /><br />Another rarely discussed aspect of Marx is his religious and racial bigotry.  You'll find plenty of bigotry in these pages.<br /><br />Marx advocates violence, greed and envy as the solution to the world's problems.  No wonder his intellectual children from Hitler, to Stalin to Mao are responsible for the deaths and imprisonment of billions of souls.  Mao Zedong is the greatest mass-murderer the world has ever known being responsible for the death of 100 million of his own people.  Stalin deliberately starved to death 10's of millions of his own people.  Hitler was responsible for the death of 20 million Russians, 20 million Germans, and the assorted odd millions of everyone from Jews to Americans.  (Hitler was a National Socialist and followed many of Marx's beliefs to the letter, so yes Nazi's are a type of Marxist.)<br /><br />On a literary level, this book is deadly boring and filled with words and concepts that don't mean any thing.  Take the slogan, \\"Worker's of the world, unite!\\"  Unite about what or around whom?  This can really mean anything.<br /><br />This kind of nonsense is true Marxism.  State some vague sentiment.  Write some inflammatory statements about \\"them\\".  (Doesn't matter who they are.)  Rant a little, insult some vague \\"class\\", state that history is on your side, and voila!, you too can be a revolutionary.<br /><br />The last part of this book is full of Marx insulting other communists and socialists.  Reminds me of the scene from the Monty Python movie \\"Life of Brian\\"  where revolutionaries are explaining that the Judean People's Front is good but the People's Front of Judea is bad.  It's really quite funny to hear nut-cases dissing other nut-cases who haven't hired Marx to  write a political tract for them.  Almost as funny as some of the reviews here that claim that Marx is a a good writer or that this deadly boring and confusing book is exciting and profound.  Read it for yourself and see!  But don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />Given that this book is boring, evil, nasty, and confusing, how then can it be important?  Marx was wrong about just about everything.  He predicted the more advanced countries would accept Marxism first.  Etc., etc..  But his movement still exists, controls huge numbers of the intelligentsia worldwide, and governments that believe in him control billions of people.  Pretty heady results for a nutcase, but hard to ignore.  And many of the things that Marx wished for are practiced in western countries daily from state control of children and their education to abortion and day-care.<br /><br />Should you read this book?  Yes, but check it out of your library rather than buy it.  You will be amazed that this convoluted trash is so zealously presented as something profound.  One Russian Marxist, Lenin,summarized Marxism with the phrase \\"Kto kvo\\" - that is \\"Who does what to whom\\".  Read this and you'll have no doubt what he means.  And when you're done reading, read something of value to wash your mind of this filth, so to speak.s what to whom\\".  Read this and you'll have no doubt what he means.

The reviews I read here really didn't go into the themes of this book, just the characters.  There are several main themes interwoven in this book.  The major plot theme revolves around whether the lead character, Susan Ward, cheats on her husband with his best friend while her child is dying in an un-supervised accident.  Did she or didn't she is the question that Susan's grandson tries to answer by putting together her lifestory.  A fairly common theme found in books from Michener's Pulitzer winner \\"Tales of the South Pacific\\" to Machado de Assis's \\"Dom Casmurro\\" (Brasilian classic), Stegner writes a gripping, haunting story.  At this level, you could call this book a relationship, chick book.<br /><br />But, you would be missing several levels of this book if you did this.  This book is, in many ways, a modern western.  Much of its action takes place in western mining locations and is a perfect description of these locations.  My father was an exploration geologist who searched for oil, uranium etc. in-between working for the Bureau of Reclamation or other government agencies.  This book accurately pegs the locations and characters in the non-cowboy west up until the 1960's.  Read it for its western landscape and people descriptions and you will get the feel of this west better than if you read dozens of history books.<br /><br />The title of the book \\"Angle of Repose\\" is a geologic term meaning \\"the steepest angle at which loose material remains intact without sliding downslope\\".  This term is applied in two ways.  First, it applies to the lives of the charcters in the book who have all slid into lives that are sustainable after failing at more dynamic lives inter-personally and professionally.  Second, it applies to the U.S. and particularly the West as the land fills up with people and there are less and less spectacular challenges to be met.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best books I have ever read at several levels and I was surprised how much of this book I remembered over many years demonstrating how well-written and gripping it is.read at several levels and I was surprised how much of this book I remembered over many years demonstrating how well-written and gripping it is.	2004-11-30

Enzio Busche	Books	4	19	19	N	N	Inspiring autobiographical vignettes of LDS leader	This is a collection of autobiographical vignettes written by F. Enzio Busche, a German-born leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS or Mormon).  The vignettes are arranged in chronological order and are almost exclusively religious.  They chronicle the spiritual development and conversion to the Church of Jesus Christ of the author.<br /><br />The story starts with his growing up in Hitler's Germany.  Even as a young boy he begins to have spiritual experiences that leave him yearning for something more.  The author describes well the post-war disillusionment in Germany and the counter-development of cynicism and distrust of any noble-sounding idea or endeavor after being so misled by the Nazi's.  His war experiences including his being drafted at war's end at the age of 14 are poignant.<br /><br />Eventually he encounters Mormon missionaries and joins the Mormon church when there is little Mormon presence in Germany and little respect.  His personal spiritual growth parallels the growth of the Mormon church in Germany.  Then he is called as a General Authority of the church and serves in a variety of callings from Mission President to Temple President.<br /><br />The latter portions of the book are a collection of experiences from his later life and are not as conprehensive as the earlier parts of the book.  I would have liked more of these later experiences and a more complete time-line of the authors more recent life events.<br /><br />Overall, the book is filled with many inspiring and informative experiences and I would recommend it highly to anyone.	2004-08-20

His twisted sense of humor isn't for all, and I notice elderly people just don't get it.  So if you're over 65, save your money.  For the rest, spend away - you won't regret it.<br /><br />The letters from detractors and questioners are also funny and add a lot to this collection.<br /><br />Not too long ago, almost every scientific meeting from the North American Benthological Society or the Desert Fishes Council to the American Academy of Family Practice would have lecture after lecture with slides from the Far Side as part of the lecture.  These slides saved an awful lot of boring lectures.  Then Gary Larson and his team of crack lawyers tracked down and shot everyone who used these without permission - and he never gives permission.  So I've been forced to sleep through many lectures that I would have formerly been awake for.  Many of these cartoons have a science background so they are best understood and appreciated from that background.<br /><br />Since I can no longer get my Larson fix free in the comics pages nor in power-point presentations at scientific meetings, I guess the only thing to do is buy this book.  (And yes those are real scientific societies I have personally attended.)<br /><br />And one more thing.  I rarely comment on the presentation of the reading material.  I'm usually indifferent to the grade of paper, font, cover art or dust jacket but I must say that these books are very well made.	2004-07-28

This is travel writing the way it was meant to be - Informative, concise and illuminating.<br /><br /> Kaplan relives his journeys from many years ago as he first travelled through the Mediterranean struggling with being a free-lance writer. Most of the book is recollections from more than 20 years ago although there are comments from recent trips back to some of the locations and a wonderful recent interview with Patrick Leigh Fermor, author of A Time of Gifts, and other well-known travel books.<br /><br /> The down-side of reporting on these decades-old journeys is that some of the spontaneity and opinion is lost. I find that sometimes I learn more from disagreeing with a travel writers' hasty opinion than in boring, well-edited neutral reporting. However, in this case, I think that the elapsed time has given this account nuances and a filtered content that add to the writing. It's as if the ensuing decades have concentrated the meaning and subtleties of the journey.<br /><br /> The part on Tunisia was replete with history of the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Berbers, and Carthaginians. Sicily was filled with the Greek influences on this place. Dalmatia, in previous Yugoslavia, and Greece were well-represented.<br /><br /> I confess I particularly enjoyed the recent encouter with Patrick Leigh Fermor who in his 80's is working on the last book of the trilogy about his travels in the 30's on foot from Holland to Constantinople. If you haven't read his first two, you need to.<br /><br /> Kaplan also includes a list of books that he considers essential to understanding these regions. It is excellent and is a good start to understanding these areas in depth.<br /><br /> Overall, excellent and gripping - which is hard in travel writing.	2004-07-28

I reread it at least yearly and I wish I had bought the hardback because I have worn out my paperback copy with rereading and note-taking and it will remain in my library permanently.<br />This book is not about fly-fishing.  The main character, Gus Orviston, exists for fishing but this book is not a snobbish put-down of non-flyfishers.  I would compare it most closely to &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;.  Where Maclean is &quot;haunted by water&quot; Duncan is immersed in it.  It is really about the business of living and becoming and how the character's family and loved ones help him on his journey of self-discovery.<br />I use this book in my life.  I often tell friends to read it.  I use stories from it to illustrate things I am explaining to patients.  I have even used it in church sermons and lessons.  The story I share most often is of the Christian friend of Gus's who learns the mercy of God and is left with a large scar on his hand as a reminder of God's rescue of his soul and body in a near-fatal drowning when his warship blows up.  Read it for yourself, but it always leaves some of the people to whom I read it in tears.<br />The writing is uneven and some of the digressions lost my interest.  The author's leftish politics are more evident than they need to be, but this really doesn't detract from the book.  And there are a few weird religious ideas and a few off-color parts.<br />On the positive side, the characters in this novel are breathtakingly complete and you can't help but fall in love with them all - imperfect though they may be.  There is a strong environmental ethic that pervades the book (That's probably why the Sierra Club publishes it).  The peripheral stories, digressions, etc. that are thrown in are generally fascinating and thought provoking.<br />The plot is really simple.  A young man leaves his home to pursue what seems to be the perfect life - fishing all possible hours of the day.  The title of the book comes because the river on which the author settles is in the shape of the word &quot;why&quot;, and pondering this &quot;why&quot; drives him to do more than just live a life of quiet desperation.  He burns out and discovers that life and fishing and the environment are really not enough without the context of family and friends.<br />I highly recommend this book; one of the best I've ever read and it stands up to repeated readings.ecause the river on which the author settles is in the shape of the word &quot;why&quot;, and pondering this &quot;why&quot; drives him to do more than just live a life of quiet desperation.

You don't have to be a science fiction fan to like this book.  There are no long, technical discussions of imaginary future technologies nor does the human race become different than it is now.  What this book does as well or better than any other book is provide hilarious commentary on war and government as it follows the adventures of an everyman named Bill as he is drafted, sent to war, lied to, cheated and abused by every institution and bureacrat he comes in contact with.  (Kind of reminds you of modern-day civilization, doesn't it?)<br />The simple plot follows a farm laborer named Bill as he is tricked into joining the army in a future inter-galactic war.  I first read this book as a teen-ager and loved it though of course the military and the government were really our friends and not run by nut-cases concerned only with their own advancement as in the book.  Well, re-reading this 30 years later after 4 years active duty and 5 in the reserves (They don't tell you that you can never leave the military if your specialty is needed when you try to resign) I find that this &quot;satire&quot; is a lot closer to the real military than almost any sincere book you can think of.  Almost every ridiculously improbable military event in the book reminded me of similar real-life occurrences I participated in or heard about.<br />All in all, this book is entertaining and forces you to laugh even as identical monstrously wrong things happen in your own life.  And, in case you're wondering, Bill does not triumph over the system, but ends up one more victim of bureaucracy and civilization.	2004-05-21

If you are trying to give a gift to someone who you really like, this book would be ideal - It's that good.<br />Briefly, this is a book of photographs of 60 trees scattered throughout the world that appeal to the author in some way.  The photos are excellent and if you have ever tried to photograph a tree you will appreciate the thought and hard work that went into this book.  The author includes photos of the biggest, the oldest, the holiest, and the oddest trees in the world.  Ruminating about why he chose these particular trees is as fun as viewing the photos and text.  Each photo is accompanied by well-written text that fleshes out the photos with historical, biological, or cultural information regarding each tree and its setting.<br />I found myself lost in time and space as I read this book and looked at the trees - which is probably what the author intended and why he calls these trees &quot;remarkable&quot;.<br />The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because I read it after I had read Pakenham's first book, &quot;Meetings With Remarkable Trees&quot;, which is even richer and better.  I'm no tree-hugger but after reading these books I could be tempted.	2004-04-23

He basically condenses his wanderings through the plains region of America into several vignettes, historical personages and occurences that convey a sense of this place.  Most of what passes for &quot;American&quot; these days comes from the much more populous bi-coastal regions.  But there is still a core of small towns, farms and small businesses that exists in our collective memories and Frazier found the real-life remnants of this culture.<br />This book is well-written and entertaining.  The small events that Frazier uses to illustrate the great plains region of the US are excellent vignettes that portray a deeper meaning than just the event itself.  For example, the author is attending a community get-together in Nicodemus, Kansas where diverse groups of people are enjoying each others company and experiences a joyful epiphany.  &quot;This democracy, this land of freedom and equality and the pursuit of happiness -- it could have worked!  There is something to it, after all!&quot;  I hope everyone has one of those moments occasionally and it is a joy to read Frazier's retelling of his.<br />Frazier does a great job of examining controversial events without throwing in snide sarcasms that seem to pass for commentary these days.  Case-in-point is his stories about Crazy Horse and other plains Indians and Custer and the whites who interacted with them.  He assigns equal doses of blame and credit to both sides.  I loved his pages on Crazy Horse and also the pages about an exuberant Custer who loved the plains region just as deeply as the Indians.  The quote Frazier uses &quot;For bringing us the horse we could almost forgive you for bringing us whiskey&quot; sums up the fine edge that Frazier balances on so well. Frazier is at his best condensing various historical sources to develop an entertaining story.<br />Frazier does display despair about the negatives of the Great Plains - the alcoholism of the Indians, the environmental issues of mining and the depletion of the aquifer, and the spectre of nuclear war that hangs over the northern great plains and its missile silos - but I still finished the book feeling both entertained and educated.  The nearest book I know of to this was Dayton Duncan's &quot;Out West&quot; and this one is better.

US	51960978	R3F7SMECGMMT72	0345326490	316822403	Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness	Books	3	6	14	N	N	Enjoyable and entertaining but not much Natural History	You've got to admire a man known as the quintessential evironmentalist who writes so gleefully about trashing nearly everyplace he goes.  This book is above all humorous and that by itself would make this book enjoyable.  Abbey is also a good story-teller.  And Abbey is a good naturalist also.<br /><br />The book chronicles a few seasons Abbey spends as a seasonal ranger in Arches National Monument (now a Park).  Abbey describes the environs adequately but in no great depth.  What is fascinating is how Abbey relates to the environment and how he interacts with it.  Also included are a few other excursions like his float trip down Glen Canyon prior to its flooding by the dam.<br /><br />My favorite parts are the dumb things Abbey does in the environment.  Maybe Abbey is saying that is why we need wilderness.  We need someplace to lay naked in the sun, burn down, carve initials into trees, or to get away from tourists.  My favorite story is when Abbey lights a wildfire in Glen Canyon with his careless bumbling and runs and jumps on his raft just as the flames roar up to the beach.  And Abbey seems to enjoy trashing the environment whenever possible doing stunts like rolling old tires into the Grand Canyon (through a mule train) and continually laying naked out in the boondocks somewhere.  He also likes carving his initials in various places.  His antics with the tourists who seem to bother him in spite of his job being to help them are priceless.  There is also a humorous account of being a part of a search for a missing (and dead and bloated) tourist.<br /><br />All in all, an amusing read more for the insight into Abbey than into the places he visited.  And let me also throw in a quote from Abbey's intro.  \\"The time passed extremely slowly, as time should pass, with the days lingering and long, spacious and free as the summers of childhood.  There was time enough for once to do nothing...\\".  Anyone who can think and write like that deserves to be read.	2004-03-20

The author has a fluid prose style but goes on too long on a few original ideas as if she is showing to us half-wits how pretty she can write.<br />I did find some incidents interesting.  For example, her ruminations on hiking in her local environs.  But certainly a few pages would be sufficient to describe this and her thoughts.  Dillard just can't seem to say anything without examining its every nuance and tiring the reader.<br />In short, I don't particularly like or dislike this book, but I expected more from its reputation.  Save this book for later, is my recommendation.	2004-03-20

If you are interested in these areas, or writing a paper or researching an article on these fields, this book is essential reading.<br />Smith has termed the assault on basic human values led by the twisted values of the Kevorkians and Singers as the \\"culture of death\\".  This term is accurate and portrays this sub-culture as it really is.<br />Smith starts with cases of neglect where physicians or others try to kill or let die others due to a variety of reasons.  Some of these cases are disturbing in hind-sight because you invariably can see the Ghosts of the Nazi ethicists lurking behind the scenes.  Smith then includes chapters on euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, withholding life-sustaining measures (like food and water), and finishes with chapters on organ donation and animal \\"rights\\".  He presents lots of evidence and direct quotes from both sides.  His treatment of the legal cases and legal reasoning involving these issues is especially strong.<br />Now, on a personal level, I am a physician who deals with these issues daily and there is truly a culture of death out there.  Every day I fight a mostly losing battle with a system that argues more about pharasaical \\"rights\\" than what is best for the patient.  Recently some family members of a dying patient kept vigil on a comatose relative so that he wouldn't \\"suffer\\" from the nurses turning him and wiping his butt after bowel movements.  Mercifully, he died before I had to call in the police to remove them from the hospital.  The family somehow felt that their \\"rights\\" to decide their loved one's care trumped common sense and decency.<br />One fault of this book is that it doesn't discuss the greatest culprit in the devaluation of life - abortion.  \\"I will give no deadly drug to any - even if it is asked for.  Similarly, I will not aid a woman to procure abortion.\\"  These lines from the Hippocratic Oath were the bulwark of medical ethics.  Most doctors no longer take this oath, but a bastardized, liberal monstrosity that is meaningless.  My advice is if your doctor doesn't believe the original oath then find another, because he doesn't have your best interests at heart.<br />In short, this book lacks pro-life information essential to this topic.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  However, it does an excellent job showing how our society devalues life in the areas of euthanasia, physician-assisted murder, and the harm that the animal movement is doing to human beings.not aid a woman to procure abortion.\\"  These lines from the Hippocratic Oath were the bulwark of medical ethics.

This book is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read.<br />If you ever took a literature class in college you will remember that there are a variety of ways to critique a book.  Most classifications include basing your critique on how well the work teaches true principles, the form of the work, the background and ambience of the work and the author, and how well the work stands the test of time.  This work fails abysmally in all of these areas.<br />First of all this is a book about nothing and nothing happens.  There is no plot and the author does not say anything worth thinking about or reading twice to get the meaning.  Some critics claim that this is why the book is so good.  Some even claim that Woolf is trying to say something about hum-drum life, family structure and even, absurdly, male and female roles.  Don't believe it! Don't waste your time reading this.<br />Secondly, this book has no form, no climax, no denouement, no nothing.  I suppose you could say that this means the form is that literary word used to describe books that make you want to commit suicide when they are assigned in an English course taught by some spinster Lesbian - stream-of-consciousness.  Well there's no stream and no character in the book is conscious.  Obviously the author did carefully construct the inner and external dialogues so it is emphatically not stream-of-consciousness.  Read Joyce and then this garbage and you will see the difference.<br />Thirdly, there is no point looking into the life and ambience of the author and period of writing if this is the best book she wrote.  (And it is generally considered the best book she wrote)<br />Lastly, this book fails the test-of-time standard.  It is becoming more and more irrelevant.<br />Now you may ask why did I read this then?  Because it was assigned reading.  This book is the written equivalent of strychnine.  Every page is so utterly bereft of anything of value that your mind and intellect writhe in agony as you force your abused eyes to read the next sentence.

I first read this book about 10 years ago in a neighborhood book club I belonged to.  Of the group of about 10 people, 8 hated it and only 2 loved it.  No one was indifferent.<br />Just because I gave this book a 5-star rating doesn't mean I think everyone will like it.  In my experience most will not.  That's because the book is hazy and doesn't make sense.  I often found myself flipping back 100 pages to figure out how the current character was related to the other previous characters.  Sometimes I would find that the current character was the same character that had died or disappeared 100 pages previously.<br />If you don't know already this book is the fictionalized story of generations of a family and the latin-american town in which they live.  It was one of the first books to be written in a style that is called &quot;magic-realism&quot;.  That means that the book doesn't have to make sense.<br />This book is one of the top books I have ever read because it is the history of the world and everyone in it.  I found myself over and over identifying with a character or recognizing someone I knew in a character.  And as far as the &quot;magic-realism&quot;, I find that that is exactly the way life really is.  I found that this book applies to everyone and its themes and characters are universal.  Don't make the mistake of thinking this is just a latin-american genre book.  Nor should you think it is a dense, philosophical novel.  The stories and sub-plots are captivating and interesting.<br />In short, this book is weird and wonderful.  Give it a shot and you might be surprised as I was.	2004-01-23

What separates a survivor from a victim is a fascinating subject, but this book is a poorly edited montage of neuro-chemistry and narratives.  The narratives are few and sparse and way overemphasize mountain-climbing accidents, all of which are avoidable. (Stay off the mountain, stupid.)  There are way too few non-climbing stories in this book.<br />Also, the author often starts into a good survival story and then pauses mid-way to throw in some neuro-anatomy and theories about the amygdala and other brain parts.  This, of course, interrupts the flow of the story and feels like reading a textbook.  Sometimes the author doesn't resume the story for many pages.  A good editor should have tightened up this problem.  If I wanted neuro-anatomy, I would get a neuro anatomy book - What I wanted in this book (and didn't get) were survivor tales and information on how they did it (and by inference, how I could do it if needed).<br />If the author really wanted to go into the science of survival he should have been much more systematic and inclusive.  Where was all the physiology information on calories and electrolytes?  And the first aid info?  The supply info? Etc., etc..<br />Also there are so many of these stories that it was disappointing to have so few in this slow-paced book.  The author did include a few military sources but they were very incomplete.  For example, why did the first female carrier pilot who even finished &quot;first&quot; in her aviation class screw up and kill herself?  What does that say about training and evaluation?  And what does that say about gender and survival? The author also missed out on the huge amount of military survival information.  Things like the Israeli experience where an elite, well-trained unit completely disintegrated because of macho attitude and failure to keep hydrated while the unit of old, fat reserve dentists who had to relieve this elite unit did so well.<br />I remember a term we used to use in the military when discussing chemical weapons accidents - TSTL.  (Too Stupid To Live)  The author could have really entertained with a few of these kinds of vignettes.<br />Overall, the author (and his asleep editor)  never could decide whether to concentrate on the amygdala or the will or &quot;heart&quot; that so many survivors seem to have.

Maxwell	Books	4	16	17	N	Y	Solid but not spectacular biography of influential Mormon	Neil Maxwell is among the most influential intellectuals of the Church of Jesus Christ (Mormon)of the 20th Century.  J. Reuben Clark, Hugh Nibley, Bruce R. McConkie, and Joseph Fielding Smith all had great influence and all wrote many books but Maxwell's influence continues to expand.<br />The author (Hafen) is himself a high Mormon authority so reader's shouldn't expect a lot of criticism. However, Hafen did include what others thought of Maxwell and some of this included criticism of subjects from Elder Maxwell's personal style to his love of alliteration and lots of big words.  Overall, this book is not a fulsome litany of praise, but a balanced, serious, and scholarly summary of Maxwell's life.<br />My major criticism of the book was that it flowed more slowly than I would have liked.  The recent biography of Nibley flowed more smoothly and made the reader able to concentrate more on the subject matter than the manner of telling the story.  I would also have like to see more about Maxwell's expectations for the future.  Hafen documents the insight of Maxwell that was ahead of his time in so many areas.<br />What does that insight say about future challenges to the Church of Jesus Christ?  What about English language and America being less of an influence in the church now that Spanish is the most common language of the Church and most Mormons now live outside the US?  What about education in the future now that public schools no longer maintain &quot;an acceptable moral and educational climate&quot;?<br />However, these minor criticisms do not compare to the strengths of this book in detailing Maxwell's life and thoughts.  There is plenty of meat in this book and I made a several page list of Maxwell quotes as I read this book.  This book is so superior to books like the biography of J. Reuben Clark by an apostate historian who included lots of little digs at Clark in the name of &quot;fairness&quot; but completely missed the grandeur and depth of the subject.<br />Overall, the second best Mormon book I've read this year.

He is, after all, the source of the new word &quot;bork&quot; - meaning &quot;to deny Senate confirmation of a nominee, especially for a U.S. Supreme Court or federal judgeship, by use of sustained public disparagement&quot;.<br />More cogently, Judge Bork understands why the judicial branch is now so politicized and what this means for Western Civilization.  This book is Judge Bork's thoughts and specific examples of how and why judges have usurped the role of the legislative branch in the US, Canada, and Israel.<br />Any reader of this book will understand Bork's views better if they know his history - and not just the fact that Bork was not confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice.  Judge Bork was a law professor at Yale in the 1960's.  He probably was the only conservative law professor and there is a famous photograph of a confused Judge Bork standing by a pile of burning books torched by campus radicals.  Understanding Bork's 40 year losing battle will help the reader understand the underlying pessimism and futility of this book.<br />Bork takes issue with court cases starting with the famous Marbury v. Madison case of the 18th Century which &quot;established the principle of judicial review&quot; (as I recall from school).  He examines many recent cases where unelected and unanswerable judges have over-stepped their bounds.<br />This book also details the courts of Canada and Israel where the courts are even more dictatorial than ours.<br />I note that yesterday the Supreme Court of Massachusetts forced legalized marriage of couples whose only claim to marriage is having a perversion in common - even though just last year the Massachusetts legislature rejected such ideas.  Clearly this book is timely and important.<br />Judge Bork marshalls support for his thesis well.  The greatest strength of the book is his analysis of legal reasoning and the consequences of each case.<br />The major negative of the book is that Bork finds no solution and clearly he didn't design this book to offer solutions; he mostly just wants to point out the problem.  Bork notes that the Constitution allows Congress to limit jurisdiction but this won't fix the problem because the state courts are just as bad (note the Massachussetts case above).  He discusses and discards Constitutional amendment, choosing good judges (Bork knows first-hand the futility of this approach), and persuading the sitting judges to behave better through threats like impeachment.<br />In the final analysis, &quot;the representative branches of government have no effective way of resisting the Court.&quot;  Which means, God help us because we're screwed and there's nothing we can do about it.<br />Read the book.  Love it or hate it, you have to respect it.case.<br />The major negative of the book is that Bork finds no solution and clearly he didn't design this book to offer solutions; he mostly just wants to point out the problem.

For those who believe that the courts have way over-stepped their Constitutional limits, this book will provide sources and ammunition to make anyone who thinks different look like an idiot.  For those who believe in a &quot;living Constitution&quot; (PC code-word meaning a judge can do anything he wants), you had better read this to understand the strength of the opposition's view point.<br />Barton explores extensively the role of Christianity in founding this country and devastates the current revisionists who claim the founders were randy, atheistic and selfish.  He uses so many quotes and original sources that I sometimes found myself thinking, &quot;Enough already - You've proved the point.&quot;  He explodes the current myths demonizing Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and the like with research rather than misleading rhetoric.<br />&quot;Original Intent&quot; is especially strong when discussing the title concept.  There is no question that the current judicial legislation is directly opposite to what the Constitution intended.<br />In spite of studying the founding of this country for years,  the author finds and quotes so many new sources that I am amazed that I've missed all of these for all these years.  Which, of course, fits Barton's broad assertions of a society where truth is ridiculed and censored away from the people so that it is difficult to  find the truth even if you try.<br />Read this if it's the only book on the subject you read.	2003-11-15

Having read this book several times (There are well-written and interesting parts), I usually then ask them what they think about some aspect of the book like the anti-male stance of the author.  Most people look puzzled and then admit they have never really read the book, they just heard from someone else that it was really good.<br />Since this book deals with Utah, aquatic ecology, medicine, and Mormonism and most of the reviewers of this book gloss over the nuts and bolts of this book, I thought I would share my impressions of this book since I have some expertise in all these areas.<br />First of all, it really isn't that interesting.  It took me several aborted attempts before I actually finished the thing and I love reading. Yes, portions of it are good prose, but I would usually finish 10 pages or so and be unable to say what exactly it was that I had just read.  The writing reminds me of Annie Dillard - confusing and over-rated in general.  There are other writers who have joined personal and family travails with nature much better.  Read Norman Maclean's \\"A River Runs Through It\\" after reading \\"Refuge\\" and you will see that there is really no comparison; Maclean is so obviously superior that you wonder why anyone ever told you \\"Refuge\\" was that good.<br />Williams attempts to tie together her mother's and grandmother's breast cancer possibly caused by radiation exposure to 1950's nuclear tests to the flooding of a bird refuge in the 1980's.  She really doesn't do this that well and this lack of similarity makes the whole book choppy at best and disjointed and irrelevant at worst.  Throwing in a little tiresome male-bashing, church-bashing, and anyone-that-doesn't-think-like-me-bashing really grates on the reader after a while and you finish the book feeling like you need to take a long shower to remove the grime from your mind.<br />That said, the strength of this book is the account of how the female family members cope with breast cancer that runs through the generations.  This is also the weakness of the book because the author has such a glaring lack of insight of the male members of the family and their feelings.  Yes, Ms. Williams, men have feelings too!<br />The last portions of this book are laughable with some mystical feminist eco-worshippers sneaking onto some government test range.  Apparently because these women chant and sway and have uteri, there is some mystical significance to this act of pointless civil disobedience.  Well anyway, I don't recommend reading this book for anything other than the accounts of breast cancer coping.  The anti-Utah, anti-Male, anti-Mormon aspects, and the real lack of anything meaningful regarding ecology makes this book not worth the effort, in my opinion.ake a long shower to remove the grime from your mind.<br />That said, the strength of this book is the account of how the female family members cope with breast cancer that runs through the generations.

I had more fun reading this book than any book I've read in a while.  A reader who doesn't have knowledge of The Church of Jesus Christ (Mormon) to which Nibley belongs would probably not find this book interesting.<br />However, for someone who is familiar with Nibley's many and varied writings this book is very entertaining and informative, much like Nibley himself.<br />Criticisms of the book are the following:  1.  The author alternates chronological chapters with topical chapters and it is sometimes difficult to remember what part of Nibley's life you are reading about.  Similarly, this means that many parts are redundant.<br />2.  I would like to have heard more about Nibley's political adventures.  As a student at BYU from 1977 to 1988 (nobody ever accused me of being overly bright)you could always count on Nibley to support the Democratic candidate.  Usually Nibley would give them permission to hand out a pamphlet he had written that was something about a parable of giving up our birthright.  My roommates and I read this thing several times and never could quite figure out what Nibley was getting at.  But we always felt vaguely guilty when we were done.<br />3.  The author several times stated as if it were fact things like &quot;conservative extremism continued to characterize BYU and Mormon culture&quot;.  Having been part of Mormon Culture and BYU for many of those years, this is not true.  There were professors like Reed Benson, son of Prophet Ezra Taft Benson, who worked as a Birch society coordinator but most of these people were the ones most likely to agree with Nibley.  J. Reuben Clark could not have been more anti-war.  Skousen, Reed Benson, H. Verlan Andersen (future general authority, author of &quot;Many are called, but few are chosen&quot;, and Utah legislator) and others were among those most likely to agree with Nibley.  The Conservatives on campus always complained that the University tilted too far leftward.  And as a Biology major, that department's leftish slant was no less prominent than the Department of Religion's rightward slant.  Having attended and visited numerous colleges since then I consider BYU the school with the most academic freedom, something Nibley no doubt recognized and benefited from.<br />Also, I would like to have heard a little more about the travails of Nibley being treated like a Rock Star.  Every dubious wacko on campus at one time or another would show up at Nibley's office or home and it was always amazing to me that Nibley not only didn't call the police but would treat everyone well and answer their questions.  Nibley was truly a man of the people.  At the &quot;One Eternal Round&quot; lecture a few years ago Nibley was almost mobbed afterward with autograph seekers and confidantes who wished to tell Nibley what their latest &quot;research&quot; showed.<br />The greatest strength of this book is the author's obvious great love and respect for this great man.  He shares letters and viewpoints that simply would be unavailable to anyone other than a family member.<br />The author also does a wonderful job summing up Nibley's articles, ideas and research - something very difficult to do and it shows the author has quite an intellect of his own.<br />Lastly the author did a wonderful job of getting at primary sources that interacted directly with Nibley - much like Nibley's scholarship.<br />Overall, this book was simply wonderful, entertaining and thoughtful.rtment's leftish slant was no less prominent than the Department of Religion's rightward slant.

I think the words \\"trashy\\" and \\"amateurish\\" would best describe this book that includes long lists of footnotes that are in some cases outright fabrications and in other instances refer to fabrications printed by some other author who also fabricated information regarding Joseph Smith when they couldn't find anything bad.<br /><br />If you are truly interested in Joseph Smith or the origins of The Church of Jesus Christ (Mormon) I suggest Donna Hill's (author is not a Mormon but an Historian) \\"Joseph Smith:The First Mormon\\".  Even better would be to read Joseph Smith himself in \\"The Book of Mormon\\" or \\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith\\".  The Library of America, in a volume entitled \\"American Sermons\\", has included a complete funeral sermon given by Joseph Smith just prior to his murder called \\"The King Follett Sermon\\".  (King Follett was a friend of Joseph Smith's and Smith gives an overview of theology that is nothing short of astounding.)  Ms. Brodie's book is really only a collection of discredited psychobabble and distortion that is quite disorganized and boring.<br /><br />And isn't it fascinating that this brief, year's old review that is buried way back in the list of reviews receives so many negative votes?  Could it be that the supporters of this trashy novel have a bigoted agenda and lots of time on their hands?  Make up your own mind, but definitely include reading Joseph Smith directly in the Book of Mormon as part of your decision making.definitely include reading Joseph Smith directly in the Book of Mormon as part of your decision making.	2003-09-03

The title of this book gives a guide to the author's underlying theme: &quot;... in the West the culture of the last 500 years is ending.&quot;  However, this book is not an 800 page list of the ills of society.  Rather it is an Eurocentric survey of Western intellectual history.  The main strength of the book is that it is lucid history with a point: we're failing.<br /><br />I spent 2 years reading this book - digesting and digressing into peripheral reading as I went.  It is not light reading and someone expecting a brief synopsis should read something else.<br />Barzan clearly has an encyclopedic mind but too often the book seems like an encyclopedia with required blurbs on a dizzying array of personalities.  The Eurocentric viewpoint of the book exposed me to many minor, and to me, unknown characters who contributed to Western thought and culture.  But, the book slighted America's input into Western thought.  For example, Thomas Jefferson receives 10 mentions in the index while Moliere, an infinitely less important determiner of Western thought, gets 14 mentions and 4 pages of text devoted solely to Moliere.<br />I also found the book lacked much on 2 major institutions that have reflected and influenced Western thought: Slavery and The Family.<br />Slavery has always existed but played a major role in development of the West for 400 years.  Of course, to the West's credit, the West was the only culture in history to abolish slavery with parts of the United States being the first political entities to specifically outlaw slavery (several New England states).<br />The rise and fall of the family unit parallels the rise and fall of society and leaving out discussion of this important part of society is puzzling in this otherwise excellent work.  One especially strong treatment in the book is the &quot;Great Switch&quot; of the early 20th century where liberalism was changed in a few short years from promoting individual freedom to promoting enslavement by the state.  I would have liked to see a longer last portion of the book protraying the decadence of modern society.  Barzun's depiction of the depravity, violence, and socialism that are killing us is too short and unsupported.<br />In summation, breadth of work, depth of European scholarship, and clarity of thought are excellent.  Lack of American influence on Western thought, missing vital institutions like Slavery and Family, and a poor summation of the thesis are faults..

He was an old rodeo cowboy with a ton of talent who turned Hollywood cowboy.  Probably his best known poem is Strawberry Roan which has become a folk song that is often not even credited to Fletcher.<br />This collection does not include Fletcher's obscene verse which is also known and recited worldwide.  Fletcher's wicked sense of humor is less evident in this collection.<br />Some of his verse is dated and stilted but it still has the flavor of horses and sagebrush running deeply through it.<br />Overall, give this book a shot if you like cowboy poetry and you'll be glad you did.	2003-03-22

This novel is not nearly as funny as the first book and raises very few questions other than the trite \\"Who would want to be a Resident?\\" question answered much better in Shem's first book.<br />This book also concentrates almost solely on esoteric abnormal psychology and is hard to relate to.  I'm  a family practice physician who did quite a few psych rotations in school and residency and I still don't quite relate to this book and its content.<br />However, Shem still is the master of describing medical malcontents masquerading as compassionate physicians. And the book was worth reading for that reason even though it wasn't as entertaining as House of God.	2003-02-25

I enjoy the genre of adventure stories with a few exceptions.  Most mountain-climbing books leave me numbly wondering why people are so stupid. ...<br />That said, I really enjoy these Man vs. World accounts.  This book is the tale of an American kidnapped by the Soviets and held in Russia for years.  His tale of the tortures he and his fellow prisoners endure will make you question how a man can survive so much with his sanity intact.<br />Dolgun does a wonderful job portraying prison life and despair and how prisoners cope with horrific limitations.  His accounts of the people and places he experienced in Russia are as penetrating as a Dostoyevsky or Dickens.  If you're interested in the Gulag, this is a much more accessible work than any of those by Sozhenitsyn with the exception of \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\".  That account is fictional; this account is not.<br />I note that you can buy a good used copy for a buck here on Amazon.  Spend that buck and be amazed that this book didn't make anyone's top 5 list of adventure stories.	2003-02-25

This book is the single best nature book I have ever read.  While doing the fieldwork for my thesis in Aquatic Ecology along the Salmon River Idaho over 20 years ago, my major Professor suggested I pick this book up.  I read it in a few hours that night in a cheap motel and then couldn't forget it during the next week as I spent long days in the River doing my Research.  I've read it dozens of times since, and every time I can feel the water running over my waders and hear the wind filtering through pine trees.<br />The title story tells of the relationship of an extended family and how they interact in a setting of western wilderness and fishing.  The passages on fly-fishing and rivers are evocative and haunting, but Maclean clearly uses the setting to tell the story of his lost brother and how the family couldn't save him in spite of common interests and love.  The accounts of Maclean's future brother-in-law and his drunken escapades in the wilderness are priceless.<br />The other stories in this book are also worthwhile and are, unfortunately, skipped over since the movie version.  To anyone who has ever worked in the West outdoors, these stories are achingly nostalgic.  They remind those of us old enough to remember the west before long-haired climbers and eco-freaks polluted and locked up these lands just how wonderful it was to be young and strong and free in a land of beauty and hardness.<br />I dare you to read this collection of stories and then find a better similar work.	2003-02-25

McPhee is an author who commonly takes uncommon topics (Geology and other \\"dry\\" subjects) and makes them into readable literary works.  Some are very good and some aren't.  Personally, I found his last prize-winning book, \\"Annals of the Former World\\" hard to read.<br />This book flows much more smoothly.  Much of it is simply a book of fishing stories and experiences.  As usual with McPhee's writing, many of the best parts are his digressions into the people and personalities he meets up with while studying his subject.<br />His historical take on the importance and influence of the shad is interesting and well-researched.  He goes back to some of the primary sources and traces the evolution of legend nicely.<br />McPhee is also an under-rated humorist.  Much of his story-telling is really funny and he is clearly sympathetic with the foibles of the people he describes.<br />This book has a few weaknesses.  First of all, unless you are interested in Natural History or Fishing, you probably would lose interest in this book.  As someone with a Graduate Degree in Aquatic Ecology, I loved the science and the scientific characters in this book.  I think others might not be so entertained, though.  Secondly, the Animal Rights and Saving the World through politically-correct (but poorly researched) gestures dilutes the pleasure of learning about the shad, McPhee and his companions.<br />Overall pretty good, and I enjoyed reading it with the reservations I noted above.	2003-02-25

Foxe's Book of Martyrs and other similar works contain thumbnail sketches of these champions of religious liberty that had so much to do with the establishment of America.  There are extensive scholarly works on some of these figures.  But it is difficult to find a popular work that has sufficient depth to really understand the struggles that these people went through to establish religious liberty as a tenet of Western Civilization.<br />This book fills in this gap.  It is the story of an English Minister who is forced into exile because his conscience will not allow him to agree completely with his church.<br />It is historical and derived from primary sources, but is told in a conversational style much like that of Alan Eckert in his early American historical works.  This form of writing flows smoother and is more appealing to someone looking for a good story in addition to learning more information on historical figures and periods.<br />As an American, I found it particularly interesting as it documented the history of a representative figure who fled the Old World for the New to find religious liberty.<br />I recommend it for adolescents and adults who would appreciate learning more of this early American immigrant and the causes that led to so many similar immigrants coming to America.  The genealogy list of descendants of John Lathrop notes that over half of the 43 Presidents of the United States were (and are since GWB is also related) related to this man.	2003-02-19

As the recipient of a MacArthur award, he spent an incredible amount of time and money researching this book.<br />His breadth of travel is truly breathtaking.  The book is quite long but also quite readable.  His accounts on island biogeography, extinction and evolution are well presented.<br />One criticism of Quammen has been his extreme politics, but in this book he keeps his political opinions under control, and the result is a more entertaining book.<br />One of the highlights of the book is the controversy between Wallace and Darwin.  I remember well the hero-worship of Darwin that existed in ecology while I was working on my Master's degree during the 80's.  Quammen's stories do a little to show how important Wallace was and that Darwin might not deserve his deification.<br />Overall, excellent information told well.	2002-03-31

Many political books are difficult to get through and often become repetitive after the first 20 pages. Once in a while, a political book transcends the genre. This book may be one of those.<br />First of all, it is a conservative book that uses a tone of all-out-warfare against the Marxist and Socialist left. It is actually refreshing to have a political author say what he means and mean what he says. While those on the left of the political spectrum will find the underlying tone of the book offensive, it is still worth while to read just for the statistics on immigration and also the history of the left's \\"long march\\" through western cultural institutions. To a conservative, this book will be disquieting because it suggests that in spite of any political tactic, the sheer demographics of the current immigrants will overwhelm their cherished way of life.<br />Secondly, the most original aspects of this book are the compilation of statistics and trends of immigration, and the history of the marxist, socialist attack on western culture. His immigration statistics and projections of trends are must reading for anyone, left or right, who wishes to ponder the future of the West.<br />Buchanan's chapter \\"Four who made a revolution\\" summarizes succinctly the authors of the left's strategy for taking over the cultural institutions of the West. Hungarian George Lukacs who realizes that the traditional family must be destroyed via sexual licentiousness and corruption of the children.<br />Italian Antonio Gramsci who realized that the bulwark of the West was Christianity and that only through assault on religion as well as taking over the arts, cinema, theater, journalism, and education would socialism ever succeed in the West. Gramsci coined the term \\"long march\\" (an allusion to Mao tse-Tung's retreat from Chiang Kai Shek in the 1930's) to describe how the Left would subvert Western Culture.<br />Renegade Marxist and admirer of the Marquis de Sade, Max Horkheimer and music critic Thodor Adorno were instrumental in the Frankfurt School, a collection of radical misfits who introduced \\"Critical Theory\\" to society - the idea that any element of Western Culture must be subjected to continual \\"destructive criticism\\". The attack politics of the Left is a natural outgrowth of this idea. Adorno is best known for labelling anything middle-class or anti-socialist as incipiently fascist, even though fascism is, after all, a type of socialism. The Frankfurt school influenced multiple teacher's colleges, starting with Columbia University and the public school system and the radical teacher's unions are the fruit of this \\"tree of knowledge\\".<br />And lastly, Herbert Marcuse, who realized that socialism would never recruit enough believers from the mainstream and realized that the Left needed to turn feminists, radical youth, those who practice homosexual behavior,black militants, criminals and other malcontents into the new average citizen.<br />In no other single source can I find this synthesis of information.<br />Buchanan also lists a few ways to combat what he says is the coming doom. I find this part of the book the weakest part (and the shortest).<br />In summary, this book may well join the pantheon of conservative classics like Whittaker Chamber's \\"Witness\\", Horowitz's \\"Radical Son\\", and the writings of Russell Kirk and Edmund Burke.nd admirer of the Marquis de Sade, Max Horkheimer and music critic Thodor Adorno were instrumental in the Frankfurt School, a collection of radical misfits who introduced \\"Critical Theory\\" to society - the idea that any element of Western Culture must be subjected to continual \\"destructive criticism\\".

I hate remembering how long I would go without sleep and the psychic torture that an internship inflicts on you.  I hated the depersonalization of patients.  I hated the sexual escapades.  Most of all, I hated having in print the real feelings of an intern who has been up for three days - praying on the way to the ER that that Nursing Home Gomer with 20 fatal diagnoses would have the decency to croak before you got there so you could get an extra five minutes of sleep or a stale doughnut before the cafeteria closed again.<br />Shem portrays masterfully the jumble of emotions of a typical intern.  There is a superficial level of glossy brown-nosing that got you into med school in the first place.  Buzz words like compassion, continuity of care and empathy are used with the teaching physicians and in meetings.  Then there is a deeper level of survival where you would kill your mother for 5 minutes of sleep or being able to crap without the code blue pager going off.  This level is usually not discussed or written about in many of the typical intern coming-of-age books out there.  Not because it isn't true, but because it's uncomfortable and offensive to non-physicians.  Shem is the master of this level of medical thinking.  No one else even comes close.  Shem approaches but doesn't quite get to an even more primal level - that of duty.  This level is what keeps an intern from punching his residency directors or the arrogant surgeon who asks him &quot;What is the difference between a sh*thead and a brown-noser&quot; and then tells you the answer is depth perception.(True story)  It's what makes you do your best when you know the patient is hopeless or even abusive as you try your best to save them from themselves or some disease.<br />The humor is black as night and the sex is soft-core porn, according to my nephew in medical school to whom I sent a copy of this book.<br />House of God has two profound themes.  The first is a detailed description of medicine and medical training.  This theme is presented with black humor, and some (but not as much as you think) exaggeration.  I have read nothing that does this better.  The second theme of the book is universal, however.  It is the theme of Man vs. World and the World wins, but the Man is too maimed to know it.<br />The book still disturbs and haunts me because Shem puts in print graphically and eloquently some of the thoughts and occurences that we don't even admit to ourselves.he first is a detailed description of medicine and medical training.

One of the enjoyable things about Bryson's travel books is that it is so easy to disagree with him.<br />What I mean by that is most travel writers are wishy-washy and state things in a neutral, innocuous and boring way.  You can always tell what Bryson thinks, and agree or disagree, I like it that way.  If you want a vague account of natural beauty or accounts stating some boring museum is &quot;educational&quot;, this book is not for you.<br />In this book specifically, you get to hear some of Bryson's thoughts on politics and culture in general.  He has absorbed a little too much liberal, socialism, but I still enjoy his fine eye for detail.<br />Overall, not his best, but still enjoyable.	2001-11-23

I, unlike the other reviewers, find this attitude refreshing.  I like an author that says what he means and means what he says.  It gives you something to sink your teeth in and this book led to a much greater depth of study and understanding than I would have without reading it.  Of course it's offensive and controversial, but I've no doubt that Christ's coming and judgements will also be offensive and controversial.<br />I'm not at all saying that I agree with everything the author says,however. But I found when looking in other Isaiah commentaries, and that's what this book really is, time and time again I found more main-stream Mormon authors at least stating that these interpretations are plausible.

However, the author rarely lets any chance to disparage humans pass.  In typical socialist enviro-speak she sees humans and any human sign as an evil scar upon the land - of course with the exception of the house, well, out-buildings and cars on her piece of purchased wilderness in a place where before &quot;there was no one&quot;.  (Reminds me of the definition of an eco-freak as someone who already has his cabin in the woods.)  A typical sentiment would be &quot;In Utah, God wants you to have a lawn&quot;.  Mildly entertaining when you first read it 50 years ago in Abbey's writings but about as fun as hearing Uncle Morty give you the 800th telling of his hemorrhoid operation - time to move on.<br />On page 145 she finds a piece of asphalt and yellow paint in her yard (which she thinks is nuclear waste of some kind)and spends until page 194 and lots of dead tree (paper) figuring out that it is harmless and not evidence of the end of life as we know it.  This kind of makes the 200 pages of anti-nuclear sentiments impotent.  In her defense, she at least tells the truth - unlike many anti-humans who openly state that any means justify the end.<br />A better question is why do I keep reading these &quot;nature&quot; writings that usually turn into political rants?  I think it's because I love these areas and have spent time in them and once in a while - although much too rarely - I find a gem like David James Duncan's &quot;The River Why&quot; or Norman Macleans &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, and hope to find another.  Sadly, what passes for nature writing these days is usually an offensive slur to people I've known and loved in my years of rambling through Western North America with my itinerant geologist father.<br />In the end, maybe I'm the dumb one because I paid 15.95 for this book.

As someone who became interested in cowboy poetry in only the last few years, I've found this collection to contain some of the best authors, both old and new. The old cowboy poetry always rhymed, and often had the cadence you feel while horseback, chasing a herd of cows. It was politically conservative, simple, and often written in a wistful style that recognized the changing nature of the American West. This collection does the genre proud. Its list of authors provides a starting point for further excursions in this art form. Much of the new cowboy poetry has gone the way of poetry in general, consisting of long-winded liberal whines full of obscure and meaningless, but politically-correct, allusions. This book has none of that, and meets the criterion for poetry taught me by my first school teacher in an old one-room schoolhouse, \\"It ain't much of a poem, if it don't rhyme\\".	1999-01-27
