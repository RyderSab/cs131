Within the parameters of several different stories that paint a much larger portrait? <br /> <br />While these stories were written in the 1930s, and one could argue that things have gotten better because of the Civil Rights Movement, this series of short stories depicts some undeniable facts through the vignettes presented in  \\"The Ways of White Folks\\".  The portraits are stark; the characterizations of cruelties, slights, the numerous examples of sheer ignorance are presented in unvarnished terms. <br /> <br />Whether it's the couple who consider themselves to be enlightened enough to collect Negro art and invite Negroes to their home or the outwardly charitable family who raise the \\"Poor Little Black Fellow\\" or the vicious cruelty of the man who sires a child and runs away in stark terror when, a year or so later, he sees the baby who bears his own red hair, Langston Hughes knows exactly how to pack an exquisite, well delivered punch straight to the gut! <br /> <br />Two of the vignettes are particularly poignant.  One is a letter from a son thanking his mother for not hailing him and showing him any recognition on a public street.  His was the good fortune to be born light enough \\"to pass\\".  He has used that pass to a better life, a white girlfriend, a good job and, of course, he would lose that if his horrid secret were revealed!  Imagine the heart of a mother who would receive such a letter.  The message is clear, \\"I need to deny you so that I can have a life.\\"  And the letter goes on tell about his white father, with a white family of his own, who would never claim any of his mulatto offspring. <br /> <br />The last story reaches a crescendo in a series that clearly depicts not only the slights but also the cruelties and brutalities that occurred when Negroes were owned.  \\"Father and Son\\" tells an often-repeated tale of a man who has lived two lives, one the life of prosperity and propriety with a white wife.  The second life is one where he magnanimously allows his black mistress/servant and mother of his illegitimate children to live in the big house (but that didn't include their children).  Further proof of his magnanimity is the fact that these offspring were allowed schooling, where some of their white counterparts were not even allowed to have an education.  The Colonel's illegitimate children are even allowed higher education, if they can handle it. <br /> <br />One son, Bert, is smart, quick, daring and light skinned.  He reminds the Colonel, his father, too much of himself in the Colonel's youth.  The physical resemblance and personality similarities between father and son are too obvious. Bert's cowers to no man and will not be treated as a nigger...and says so publicly.  His daring, where previously bringing him relatively little personal harm because the Colonel would back down, ends catastrophically. <br /> <br />Langston Hughes is a masterful, engrossing, captivating writer and the portrait of some white folks is shameful.  Do we ever see ourselves as others see us? <br />	2004-11-04

His story is a page-turner; the reader is shocked that former slaves could own their families.  Purchasing one's family from the master was one of the only ways to gain freedom.  The other was being set free by the owner, a rare occurrence.   <br /> <br />Some of the freed went on to be slave owners and readers cannot help but feeling disbelief and ask why, after the humiliation of being owned, would anyone want to assume the role of master/mistress?  But the historical facts remain. <br /> <br />Jones also goes on to show how there were the echelons of slaves.  A fair person, the product of a white master and a black slave, could go on to a more favorable existence...including being the owner of slaves.  One of the peculiarities of this situation was that the fair skinned owners really thought of themselves as superior and their own slaves were not necessarily treated any better than when they were the property of the white master. <br /> <br />\\"The Known World\\" is an apt title as the repetitious and small world of a few plantations comprised the entire world that was known to the slaves.  One master may sell a slave to a nearby neighbor; another one is freed and moves in close proximity to his former master, so that their universe rarely grows larger.  Even traveling on an errand from one neighbor to another, or from the plantation to town, requires the written permission of the owner. <br /> <br />Freedom, when gained, is short lived for some of the freed slaves, who do not leave home without the papers that substantiate their freedom.  There are the unscrupulous who destroy the papers and once again sell the free into bondage. <br /> <br />The reader gets to know a score of the characters who are well described.  We know where they come from, and in certain instances, what will become of them.  And this is a very clever tool that Jones utilizes.  He projects certain characters way into the future, even if their rolein the novel is brief. <br /> <br />There are very few morally upright characters in this story.  A white sheriff makes a series of attempts to be fair but is outnumbered by those who feel the slaves are worth only what price they bring.  And when morality is raised as an issue, even some of the slaves fail the test.  Any possibility of power over fellow slaves is too tempting to pass up.  Gaining favor of the master or mistress is the name of the game. <br /> <br />Jones is an excellent storyteller!  He can jump many years ahead and not lose his readers, as he brings them back to the day at hand.  Fortunately, there is a redeeming ending and we learn that for some freedom was truly liberating. <br />	2004-09-28
US	46157981	R22JNBJNJTJWIQ	1400041147	873250864	The Dew Breaker	Books	5	17	17	N	N	A tapestry of discrete stories.	One of the book's face pages mentions that the \\"Dew Breaker\\" is actually comprised of many shorter stories, some of which were previously published independently of one another in various journals.  It takes an artist to blend these discrete stories, string them together as chapter titles, making them cohesive so that the reader understands a larger picture.  Danticat does this with style, with escalating tension, and by drawing the reader into a maze of facts, characters and their personal stories with similar characteristics.  All their lives have been touched by the reigns of terror under the Haitian dictators, Papa Doc and Bebe Doc Duvalier.  <br /> <br />The novel opens with the Dew Breaker's telling his beloved daughter of his background.  Prior to the confession, he had been the tortured...not the torturer.  And, following this confession, the story moves back and forth in time. <br /> <br />One very clever touch, among many, is the portion where the Dew Breaker, now a respectable barber living a very quiet life in New York attends Christmas Eve Mass with his daughter and wife, Anne.  Ka, his daughter, stares at a man she thinks to be a wanted man in Haiti.  His picture appears on posters all over town because of his human rights violations.  In the end, noticing the suspect bears an overall resemblance to the criminal, but is not an exact match, the reader is drawn to the fact that her own father, the Dew Breaker, altered his own appearance so as not to be recognized.  He was formerly described as a very large man.  No more.  A parallel to the man in the pew? <br /> <br />Going along with this strain of disguises, the bridal dress seamstress is also sure the Dew Breaker lives across the street from her but when a nosy reporter attempts to look into the house, a neighbor tells her no one has lived there for a long time.  When this is pointed out to the seamstress, she relates that no matter where she moves, he finds her.  How?  Because she tells her \\"girls\\" (the various women who utilize her dressmaking skills) when she is moving.  That's how the Dew Breaker knows.  Is this accurate?  Her imagination, grown out of her own story of horror when the Dew Breaker tortured her because she would not date him? <br /> <br />Then there is Anne, his wife, who has known her husband's story for many years and has willing collaborated in her husband's obscure existence in order to keep a very low profile.  They have no friends, cannot risk ever being recognized, seem to operate exclusively in a Haitian neighborhood.  Which begs the question, wouldn't the probabilities be even greater that a criminal would heighten the chances of his recognition in a smaller neighborhood where so many have been touched by the regimes of the Duvaliers? <br /> <br />Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that if the personification of horrors lives and works just down the street, a victim would be less likely to stir up a hornets nest!  Nonetheless, Anne too, was touched by the Dew Breaker.  Her own stepbrother was murdered by him yet she appears to believe that her stepbrother, a minister who openly preached against the regime, committed suicide.  Is the author trying to show that many mechanisms are employed to stay alive?  To attempt to forget?  To make the best of the hand one is dealt? <br /> <br />Danticat employs interesting characters to tell her short stories and she effectively uses the breaks in the various narratives to grow her overall story.  And those short stories also provide her with the mechanism to jump back and forth in time between Haiti and New York.  The reader is transported briefly into the stories of these diverse characters, their time in history, its effects on their lives and, when blended together, they create a whole, engrossing story. <br /> <br />Her final coup d'etat is the story of the \\"Dew Breaker\\" himself; he is detestable, heartless, ruthless, cunning and he has become the quiet scholar, the man fascinated with the Egyptian \\"Book of the Dead\\".  What does he seek there? <br />	2004-09-27
US	46157981	RSCPUFLJYJ1S6	0743454510	409444903	Second Glance: A Novel	Books	2	10	11	N	N	A mélange of love, ghosts and schmaltz!	Jodi Picoult is a good writer.  Her \\"Second Glance\\" is a smattering of the history of eugenics in Vermont and she uses it as a launching pad for a series of questions about genetics counseling to prevent some of the diseases that have plagued families.  In a capsulized form, any miraculous discovery...be it biological (DNA)...or otherwise...has its opportunities for good or for bad.  Picoult posits many good arguments, as in the discussion between Ross and Meredith, the genetics counselor. <br /> <br />The story starts very slowly.  Ross' personal difficulties, the loss of his great love, Aimee, his suicide attempts, his pre-occupation with ghosts make for slow reading.  The story really begins to move once the element of eugenics as practiced in Vermont in the 1920s and 1930s, is introduced into the plot.  The quotations from the proponents of sterilization are shocking when viewed from a modern day perspective.  Further, to be informed that Hitler ultimately used some of the movements' faulty premises as a basis for his own destruction of others who were labeled inferiors, makes it all the more shocking.  It was more comfortable to point to Hitler for such monstrous ideas! <br /> <br />Some of the dialogue is melodramatic and schmaltzy.  Tobacco smoke curls in Ross' throat like a question mark.  Ross wonders if his deceased beloved, Aimee, may have come back as Lia, the novel's central character.  Murdered over 70 years ago, Ross is infatuated with Cecilia Pike, whose own husband was infatuated with her.  Both Ross and Cissy Pike's husband switch their allegiances very quickly.  Ross switches his allegiance from Aimee to Lia and Cissy's husband's estimation of his wife crashes when he mistakenly feels she is having an affair with an Indian and has given birth to his child of mixed race.  How could this happen with the daughter of a fellow believer in eugenics?  She, the daughter of such high quality? <br /> <br />The most interesting part of this novel is what actually occurred 70 years ago with the ill fated, Cissy Pike.  What really happened to Cissy?  Who murdered her?  Did her baby really die?  Who was supposed to have killed the baby?  (This where modern-day DNA testing  helps to solve mysteries.)  <br /> <br />Twists and turns, with eugenics as the foundation.  Gypsies and the feebleminded were undermining society.  According to historical quotes, it was important that basic, solid Vermont stock be restored to its origins.  The inferiors couldn't be allowed to procreate.  And, like Hitler, anyone could be labeled inferior to suit the hypothesis.  Native Americans, in this case the Abenaki, were considered Gypsies...shiftless...thieves...lazy.  There were actual charts to substantiate the fact that the inferior begot societies ills.  So why not restore order? <br /> <br />By skipping about from present day to the 1920s and 1930s, the author keeps us on our toes and waiting for more of the ultimate answers.  However, what could have been a tightly woven story becomes schmaltzy because of some of the dialogue.  It is of some interest, nonetheless. <br />	2004-08-31

The cottage was originally built by a fisherman who wanted to give up the dangerous profession because of the perils of making a living at sea.  And the trade became all the more dangerous when the British blockaded access to the sea.  Blackbird house became the symbol of freedom from a seagoing livelihood that had no guarantee of a homecoming. <br /> <br />The reader then becomes an audience to the various people who inhabited the house from Revolutionary times to the present.  The house goes from pristine to rundown over time and mirrors the ups and downs of the house's various inhabitants.  There are other threads that lend continuity to the novel and that is the white blackbird which was originally lost at sea with the cottage's builder, a field of flowers that resurrects each spring, and a pond that becomes a convenient disposal site for a violent, abusing husband. <br /> <br />While it is a clever concept and unrelated lives are woven together over time because the house is both a backdrop and a central character, the book is a pleasant read at best.   <br />                                                                      <br /> <br />	2004-08-16

There is an axiom that states \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\"  In this case, the black fading into charcoal gray dust jacket (with a flowering golden sprig) is a precursor of things to come.  The stories are dark, somber and brilliant.  Who else could construct a series of stories where grief, anger and abuse are manifested in such creative, innovative and bizarre ways? <br /> <br /> A woman loses her mother.  The relationship, while lightly touched upon, was probably an inseparable one (the daughter states, \\"She was the flesh of my flesh.  I was the flesh of her flesh.\\")  Post the mother's death, her daughter begins to turn to stone but not just any stone; she begins layer by layer to manifest the various exotic stones found in Iceland.  They are veined, with complex glints of underlying colors and multiple hues.   <br /> <br />Then there is an Icelandic sculptor who goes to enormous difficulty to bring her rigid, statue-like self back to the land of his ancestors.  Was this all a metaphor for a woman who was experiencing grief?  An unmarried woman, the reader might conjecture, who was faced with an enormous personal transformation without her mother?  One who needed a sculptor to introduce her to the real and essential self whom she had not previously recognized? <br /> <br />The bizarre journey proceeds as the reader meets the members of a writing class, experiences the rich memories of its oldest class member, as she describes everyday life when running a household was much more labor intensive.  There was the cast iron stove to be kept highly polished on a daily basis, the laundry that was to be boiled, stirred and immersed into multiple rinses.  Then came the laborious ironing! The woman's writings depicted a gentle, hardworking woman, and an anachronism to other class members who tore her writings apart because of their being perceived as commonplace.  Who is she really?  The writing class teacher later discovers part of her mystery...much to his horror! <br /> <br />A pink ribbon is the only adornment of a woman whose very self is being lost to dementia.  Through a \\"tarted up\\" ghost, the reader discovers her in retrospect.  To say more is to spoil! <br /> <br />Byatt is a genius!  The stories might seem just that ... short stories.  It's the pondering and opportunities for analysis that the stories invite.  There exist many possibilities for each of the characters, their lives, their challenges, their joys and obstacles.  Byatt layers her challenges to the reader.  On the surface, what were the stories about?  But beneath the layers, what were the stories really about? <br />	2004-08-13

It's tough to follow a novel like \\"Girl With the Pearl Earring.\\"  I imagine it was Chevalier's hope to be able to weave as rich a tale with the art of tapestry making as she did with making a world-famous painting come vibrantly alive.  The tapestry-based tale  is only a mildly successful attempt at weaving families, politics, artisans and a class system.  <br />It's interesting to learn how tapestries were made, what went into them both thematically, materials and labor wise.  However, there just wasn't enough story to produce the envisioned results...tapestries that both adorn the walls of the wealthy and that are also representative of and intertwined with myth, characters, skills and history. <br />Instead we get artist on the make (non-stop); young maidens on various socio-economic levels who succumb to his charms; artisans operating on the whims and commissions of the monied and the mid-level managers who do the bidding of the wealthy.<br />There were a few redeeming parts of the story however.  One being Nicholas des Innocents somehow coming off his high horse and recognizing the natural beauty of some of the women around him.  An \\"aha moment\\", one presumes, results in Nicholas'changing his original paintings so that the eventual tapestries reflecting his artwork would capture the more common women's beauty rather than that of the two higher born ladies who would have originally graced the tapestries.<br />This much-anticipated novel was a disappointment.  \\"Girl With the Pearl...\\" and \\"Fallen Angels\\" were far more successful.  This seemed like a tepid attempt to return to a more successful, a tried and true, mode of telling a story.  Interesting process (tapestry making); not so interesting tale.	2004-03-08
US	46157981	R2KWLB9O1VL28K	1400040256	611591767	The Girl Who Played Go	Books	3	1	3	N	N	The manipulations of go and a doomed relationship.	Not long ago I read an anthology by famous writers, their insights, their theories, their speculations about the art and peculiarities of writing.  One writer in particular caught my interest because his essay dealt with translations and how, despite his intense efforts to work with translators so that the mood, meanings and messages contained in his works would be accurately captured in another language, it was not possible because of the intricacies and subtleties of all languages .  So now, when I read a translation such as this novel, I always wonder what has changed, what has been lost, what precisions of the original language have not been accurately captured.<br />The Girl Who Played Go (and we only find out her name at the bitter end) illustrates that historical time very wellthat of the Japanese occupation of Manchuria.   Shan Sa is particularly adept at saying much with few words.  Her chapters are often only a couple of pages yet she aptly portrays the Japanese soldier her game opponentas proud, vain, thoroughly steeped in the belief that the emperor is god and someone to gladly die for. That Japan and the Japanese are superior.  That the Chinese people, the conquered, are inferior, worthy of being conquered and would eventually be the better off for having been dominated.<br />Shan Sa depicts the 16 year old girl as fanciful, idealistic, dissatisfied with her parents, her homelife, her unhappily married sisters lamentations, and her school.  Life is a bore, except for go where the girl gets to control her opponents.  The dialogue and the girls flare for the dramatic nonetheless remind me of a highly stylized soap opera.  For example, post her abortion, she resumes the serial game of go with the soldier and feeling weakened from the procedure she asks him,  Will you do me a favor?  This is pretty much out of the blue seeing there has been scant dialogue between them despite their continual parrying for a dominating role inthe game.  The girls wish is to return to a temple she visited with her former  lover.  The reason?  So that she can be watched over while she sleeps.  A long nap at that certain hour of the day would cause suspicion in her home.<br />In another example, the girl tells the soldier that as a result of their many game sessions shes been able to see into his soul as theyve played the game of strategy. Conversely, even though he is supposed to be acting as a spy for the Japanese because of his gift for the Chinese language, he also fantasizes about her, her clothing, her eyes, the color of her skin.<br />The brutality of the Japanese conquerors is vividly described when the girls lover, a resistance fighter, is caught along with his other secret lover.  They are tortured by an interrogator who revels in his brutality.  The soldier is invited to observe.<br />The method utilized by the author is engaging.  Few words, extremely short chapters nonetheless keep the reader interested, while knowing ultimately that the subtle but growing infatuation of both the young girl and the soldier is doomed.  No happy endings possible here.  Keeping in the tone of the novel, the ending is also highly melodramatic!  The girl finally tells the soldier her name.  She has been apprehended by the Japanese, the soldier goes to rescue her, knowing that his fellow soldiers will sexually assault her.  It is a true operatic ending!	2004-02-25

He leaves besieged Ireland as a young boy after both his parents are killed.  The Earl of Warren is the territorial dictator and the lives of those in his environs are expendable.  For example, when his horse-drawn carriage runs down Cormac's mother and kills her, the Earl sends a paltry amount of money to cover funeral expenses.<br />There is the magic of the ancient Celtic beliefs and ceremonies and one must suspend logic and disbelief for what follows when Cormac kills the Earl and flees to the United States.  In New York he meets as many historical ills as there were in Ireland.  It is still the moneyed who rule the world and men's (and women's) lives.<br />Cormac is sworn to kill the whole of the Earl's line in order to destroy, I presume, the possibility of the Earl's \\"issue\\" continuing his injustices.  As a reader, I wondered many things.  Once Cormac destroys the line, would there have been other Warrens he just didn't know about and, therefore, his sworn oath would not have been really fulfilled?<br />The story is interesting, to a point, then it becomes tedious...even when suspending logic and disbelief. The history is the interesting part and to tell it over a 200+-year period, culminating with the destruction of New York's Twin Towers is an awesome task.  Cormac and his vendetta are the vehicles.<br />Cormac literally drifts through history, tires of living so long while awaiting his destiny. The reader sees little character growth as he passes through many decades.  He is a voice, a guide, a translator of politics, art, architecture, religion, music, human failings and foibles.   It is only at the end that he finds love, a reason to live and we see a desperate Cormac searching for the woman who is carrying his child and who most probably has perished in one of the Twin Towers.<br />The finale resembles a badly written romance novel!	2004-02-10

Sally and Larry struggled for money from the early days of their marriage.  It were not for the beneficence of Charity and Sid, they may have struggled endlessly.  But it is a fortuitous meeting between the two young couples at a Mid-Western university that opens many doors to the poorer of the two couples.<br />Charity (is her name meant to be ironic?) is a mover and shaker from a wealthy East Coast background.  Sid would never have been deemed appropriate by Charity's mother had it not been discovered that the unassuming young man had considerable wealth of his own.  From that moment on his stature grows with the family and his future path is taken in tow by Charity.  She demands that Sid become a published writer.  It seems an easy enough task for Larry but for Sid, it's a task that never really comes to fruition. <br />Charity is relentless in her drive to have Sid become tenured at the Mid-Western university.  It does not come to pass and she is so devastated that a mysterious stay in a sanitarium was required.  So positive is Charity that Sid will be asked to stay permanently at the university that she commandeers the building of a stately home in the college area.<br />From young couples with growing families to middle-aged persons, the reader follows their trials and tribulations.  Sally has borne the devastation of polio with the usual grace she brings to any situation.  Larry is her devoted, admiring follower and support system.  Charity still tries to run everyone's lives and is now in full charge of her own demise...from cancer.<br />Charity grates on a person.  Despite her charitable tendencies, she is such a strong personality that she dominates everyone and everything.  Now, at the threshold of her death, Charity has reconvened her friends and grown family for a picnic of all things.  The menu has been selected; certain songs should be sung...of course!  And Sid utterly refuses to join the festivities Charity has deemed a must!<br />Sid obviously loves his wife, is devastated at her imminent death, is unsure he can live without Charity.  Yet, he is torn by her insistence that she go to an institution to die.  In her mind this is to save Sid...yet again.  This part of the story is hard to follow.  Has Sid, early on deemed wanting, been treated as a child so long that he cannot handle another dimension of life's trajectory?<br />Oddly enough, it is Sally who seems to best understand her devoted friend Charity and often defends Charity to Larry when he bristles with what he has observed as Charity's treatment of her husband.<br />\\"Crossing to Safety\\" is beautifully written!  It is the writing that helps to forgive some of the weaker parts of the story.	2003-12-23

Katie Fisher is characterized as a sweet, innocent, teenager, fully entrenched in Amish ways.  She could not possibly have murdered her newborn son.  With medical evidence to the contrary, Katie denies any knowledge of the baby; she denies even having given birth.  Period.  How can she be defended in a court of law by a distant relative who is a high-powered Philadelphia lawyer prepared to win this case, even stretching the truth if necessary?  Ellie Hathaway wins at all costs and does not blink when she tells the defendant that it's just a matter of whose story a jury will believe.  Ellie's is usually the best and most convincing, truth not always a necessary element.  Her track record in a courtroom proves it.<br />Will the insanity defense work?  Was Katie disassociative, aware of the pregnancy but not fully cognizant of it?  Surrounding the carefully built story is the protective coating called the Amish (the \\"Plain\\") community.  To go against the grain, to disobey the strict codes of conduct is to be shunned, even excommunicated!  Yet Katie arrives at a point during the trial where she wishes to confess all as her memories of the birth return little by little.  But Katie is unflagging, adamant that the baby disappeared after the birth; when she awoke the next morning after having silently borne the pain of giving birth alone in the Fisher's barn, the baby was missing.  Found dead later by a farm hand; it had been suffocated.<br />According to Amish ways, public confession of one's sins is absolutely necessary and once the penitent is sufficiently punished, including being banned from any interaction with the rest of one's own family for a specific amount of time, the sinner can be re-embraced by all.  According to her lawyer a confession will only result in a guilty verdict and confinement to a state penitentiary, a brutal confinement Katie couldn't endure given the totally protective environment in which she has been raised.<br />Three stories run side by side.  The story of the Amish community.  The story of Katie and her immediate clan within a larger Amish community.  The story of Ellie the lawyer and the sophisticated, highly competitive environment within which she resides.  A clash of beliefs, values and mores is inevitable!  And that is what gives substance to the skeleton of what might seem like just another mystery.  It is not.<br />Jodi Picoult has done her homework.  The reader is exposed to the courtroom, biological information from the medical examiner, the varying professional opinions of a clinical and a forensic psychologist and the result is that the reader can understandably be sympathetic/confused/bewildered by the multiple and conflicting representations of Katie the innocent, the Katie who spurned the beliefs of her religious community, the murderous Katie who gave birth to and subsequently smothered her baby and hid the body.  So whodunit?<br />There is a surprise ending.  A hint to the reader:  pay attention to your gut feeling and you may be right!	2003-12-03

The Reverend Kumalo is at the center of a social experiment that has destroyed tribes, families, societal values and human beings.  He is a poverty-stricken minister, caring for his flock of villagers living in a drought-stricken area of South Africa.  The drought and its devastating effects on the capacity of the already-poor to farm and provide for their families seems to be a metaphor for the human drought born of racism and emerging apartheid.<br />The land will no longer feed them, the young flock to already-teeming Johannesburg and they then get swallowed up in the further degradation of thievery, murder and prostitution.  And the majority Afrikkaners then satisfy themselves with the proof positive that blacks are inherently weak, untrustworthy, lazy and are beneath dignity.<br />This novel both paints a devastating picture of everything that's wrong with racism and the ensuing apartheid while holding out hope that there are some among the white who see the problem as clearly as Reverend Kumalo and strive to do something about it.  Unfortunately, however, those who advocate for the despised sometimes get destroyed in the process.<br />And that is exactly what happens to one idealistic young man, the son of a wealthy Afrikkaner landowner, who writes extensively and publicly advocates for those who have no power.  But the young man is not destroyed by one of his own, who fears a change in the power balance, but by one of those for whom he advocates.<br />Each father mourns the loss of his son; the father of the murdered knows the white man's justice will prevail but will still leave him childless and the black man's father knows he has lost a son on two counts.  One, he lost his son when Absalom left the village and broke all communication with his heartbroken parents.  Two, for a black man who killed a white man, there is only the white man's justice.<br />Reverend Kumalo meets the good, the bad, the indifferent, the greedy and the generous.  His dialogue is that of a humble man, loved by his townspeople, deeply respectful of others.  While his demeanor is very self-deprecating, he cannot be mistaken for one who is servile.  Reverend Kumalo's deep understanding of human beings, with all their inherent imperfections and machinations, is awesome.  Despite this, he forgives.<br />Thankfully, despite his great personal losses, Reverend Kumalo witnesses a number of small miracles thanks to an unexpected source.  His benefactor, and that of the village's, is the father of the young man who was murdered.<br />This is an eloquent book written by one who truly understood the evil and great destructive powers of any system that strips a people, any people, of their basic and fundamental rights to be<br />respected, independent and self governing.	2003-11-07

It has been a quantum leap, excellence-in-writing-wise, from Tracy Chevalier's \\"The Virgin Blue\\" to \\"Girl With the Pearl Earring\\".  Girl With the Pearl took the bestseller's world by storm.  It is a very rich tapestry, as rich as the original painting that was the inspiration for the story.  However, that is not the verdict on \\"Virgin Blue\\".<br />Chevalier tries to resurrect history, by utilizing sixteenth century imaginary characters from the Tournier (Turner) family and making it all blend with Ella Turner's present-day existence.  It doesn't work well.  The most interesting part of the story is the historical past when Huguenots and Catholics battled one another and both felt they possessed \\"The Truth\\".  <br />Ella Turner is newly arrived in France with her architect husband.  Her plans are to pursue her mid-wife profession in France and that will require much study in order to pass rigorous exams in French. She also toys with the idea of starting a family but that plan soon fizzles on two accounts: (1) nightmares each time she tries to conceive; and (2) her burning interest in pursuing historical documentation that would tie her to the Tournier family of the sixteenth century.<br />Where Chevalier seems to put a foot wrong is by drawing parallels that fit so badly.  There is a loutish, brutish Etienne Tournier who pursues and impregnates a local girl (Isabella) from a poor family.  The Tournier family's claim to fame is being in service to a local Duc de l'Aigle.  Then, jumping forward to the present, Ella's own husband is increasingly faulted for not being more sensitive to her own needs, and her needs seem to be ambiguous at best.<br />Ella's parallel character is Isabelle DuMoulin-Tournier, also a mid-wife as was her mother.  Her brutish husband endlessly persecutes Isabelle, known as \\"La Rousse\\" because of her red hair,  because she hails from a Catholic family, and the Virgin Mary is often pictured with red hair.  Ella is plagued by dreams of blue that progressively take on more texture and form.  With each dream she becomes less and less interested in her husband, starting a family and more interested in a local librarian who is able and eventually willing to assist her in her quest.<br />It's never believable that Ella's husband, who is readily accepted in his French workplace and seems like a pretty likeable guy, has sufficient faults for Ella to be so drawn to the Frenchman, Jean-Paul, even when Jean-Paul seems to view Ella's genealogical pursuits with a great deal of skepticism.  Jean is also the name of one of the sons Isabelle has borne Etienne.<br />Ella is increasingly dissatisfied with her new home in a small town she originally found so picturesque.  Further, she seems to resent the fact that her husband is so laid back and accepted while she tries so hard to fit in and is given the \\"cold shoulder\\" from the market to the library.<br />There is also a mysterious character that intermittently pops up in La Rousse's life, a poor shepherd who she finds intriguing seeing her own life is so miserable.  Not only does her husband abuse her but Isabella's mother-in-law silently and very effectively adds to the abuse.  Perhaps the character, Jean-Paul, serves a similar purpose, one with whom Ella might have a future?<br />In the end, Ella finds some of the answers she has so aggressively pursued, some of them shocking and unpalatable.  In the epilogue Chevalier explains more about the persecution of Huguenots by Catholics and the Huguenots' retaliation but does not explain if some of the treatment of their children is historically accurate, i.e. slaying them and burying them within the house.  Or was this entirely fictional?	2003-10-21

Was he really mixed up in espionage, codes and a plot against his own government?  The reader must decide.   Nonetheless the reader's trip from England to Burma is an exotic, engaging one.  Edgar, a devout piano tuner, is summoned by the military to make an arduous trip to Burma to tune an Erard, an instrument that is to the piano what the Stradivarius is to the violin.  He's honored that his reputation is so sterling that he willingly undertakes the mysterious journey in what he believes is in service to his queen, leaving behind a loving wife to whom he is equally devoted.<br />The story takes place in the 1800s.  Britain, as a colonialist country, has laid claim to portions of India and Burma and is fighting multiple (Burmese) regional princes who are not about to willingly give up their country or their way of life.<br />As Edgar travels by train and boat, he's fascinated by his novel surroundings.  Rather than passing judgment on the different food and customs and beliefs he encounters, Edgar is smitten.  Finally, he meets the mysterious Surgeon-Major Anthony J. Carroll, who is so important to the English that they would accede to the unusual request for both the Erard and a piano tuner who must put it right because of the piano's own perilous trip, Burma's humidity, plus having been through a full on military attack by an enemy!<br />Enter a beautiful woman.  She is intelligent, attentive to Edgar, escorts him about the mountainous environs where Carroll is in charge, introduces him to the local flora and lore.  What the mysterious Khin Myo's relationship is to Carroll is speculative but her importance is obvious and she is omnipresent.<br />Carroll appears to be the antithesis of the British conqueror and introduces a fascinated Edgar to the small medical clinic he has founded where he assists the local people as best he can using both meager supplies of western medicine, as well as blends of herbs from the local area.  Carroll is an avid scientist and social scientist.  He has studied malaria, for example, although he has no archives to search or modern day medical journals, he's surmised that it is a mosquito that bears the disease.<br />The good doctor is also well schooled in local myth and lore and uses his ample negotiating skills to make peace with the local warlords.  He's convinced he can bring about peace without firepower.  Music is also a preferred tool to his anticipated peaceful outcome.  Edgar is fascinated and Carroll completely wins him over.<br />However, over time the doctor seems to elevate Edgar's role from piano tuner to one involved in bringing about peace to the area.  Edgar is perceptively unwilling to return to England and the western ways.  This proves his undoing.  <br />The beautiful Khin Myo's allure is fundamental to Edgar's remaining with the Shan people.  The relationship remains chaste but promising?  Then everything falls apart and Edgar is accused of being the doctor's accomplice in betraying his country.  To describe the plot more is to spoil the journey for the reader.<br />The author is impressive in his storytelling, although parts of the tale are slow moving...perhaps intentionally.  Especially in the descriptions of Edgar's journey to Burma.  Nonetheless his research into the country, its history, its music, its lore is certainly evident.  Finally, the descriptions of the Erard, of the tools of piano tuning, as well as the painstaking process in tuning a piano are just as impressive!	2003-10-13

Richard Russo has a unique ability to plant his readers in the middle of a story, withholding just enough information, to leave us wondering \\"What happened that I don't know; what's that missing foundational piece to this story?\\"  As each of the short stories emerges, the reader immediately surrenders herself to being swept up in the stream of an evolving story about commonplace folks.  The nun who wants to join a fiction writer's class without the pre-requisite classes. What is it that she's so eager to tell?  And why is she so willing to subject her story to the amateurish literary critiques of her fellow classmates?  The young boy who joins his mother in a whirlwind trip across country in apparent abandonment of her married life. What's so lacking in her husband and marriage?  His greatest transgression seems to be twirling a metal washer on the tip of his tongue.<br />Each time the reader asks, \\"What don't I know?\\"  Along with the young boy who accompanies his mom in her flight, we ponder what course of events initiated these varied situations?  Russo parcels out the information in sufficient portions to keep us interested, sympathetic, understanding and appreciating his substantial writing skills.  His knowledge of human beings, their idiosyncrasies, quirks and fallibilities is appreciably apparent.<br />This collection of short stories is a quick read; nonetheless, each story is satisfyingly compact in its apt descriptions of the characters and the situations in which they find themselves.  Finishing one story leaves us eager and willing to embrace the next one!   And another journey begins with an exciting expectation of being plopped down in the midst of still someone else's living space.	2003-10-07

His knowledge and interests are wide ranging...from a variety of religions to animal behaviour.  Yann Martel imbues his character with a questioning mind.  For example, why cannot multiple religions be embraced simultaneously without any contradictions?  Contrary to the explicit warnings of his zookeeper father, is animal behaviour cast in stone (like religious beliefs)?<br />Undergirding Pi's fantastic journey is his name Piscene...voluntarily shortened to Pi because his name was constantly being ridiculed.  Pi is a numerical constant...a symbol of the inviolability of the beliefs with which he's being surrounded?<br />His beliefs are put to the proverbial test when his journey to the family's new home in Canada is literally shipwrecked.  Pi is the sole human survivor; however he is further challenged by his shipmates...three animals that accompany him on his physical and spiritual journey. They were on their way to new zoo homes. Pi's companions are an orangutan, a Bengal tiger, a hyena and a zebra.  The Bengal tiger soon devours the other animal life and it's Pi and the tiger against the elements.  Pi rightfully wonders when he'll be next.<br />That's where his ingenuity takes over and the survival of both man and beast becomes equally important to him.  Richard Parker, said tiger, requires constant food and fresh water.  Pi, thanks to Mother nature, provides Richard Parker with a regular diet of fish, turtles and other fruits de mer and utilizes the lifeboat's survival manual and equipment to make fresh water.<br />Pi structures his day in order to survive.  Make water, pray, catch seafood, clean lifeboat while avoiding Richard Parker's pounce.  But Richard doesn't pounce.  So much for pre-determined animal behaviours.  Pi also sees himself within an awesome sphere surrounded by incredible skies and stars at night, a veritable peephole into the universe he muses.<br />Along the way, just when all hope seemsto fade, both Richard and Pi find a strange island.  Hallucination?  Fantasizing?  The island does not fit any known pattern...fits no expectations.  Another challenge to pre-ordained thinking?<br />Ultimately Pi finds land, Mexico, and is rescued.  Richard Parker disappears into the landscape.  Was Pi Richard Parker?  Did any of this really happen?  Pi's tale is certainly debated and found less than credible by the Japanese shipowners' representatives.  They want just the facts.  How did the ship explode?  What noises did the ship make before exploding?  Just the facts!  Pi nonetheless sticks to his story and provides another conundrum to the firm representatives when he invites them to select what they perceive as the truth(s) in two versions of the same story he tells.  One is as he lived it with all its incongruities, the other is as they would have it be.<br />Pi and Richard, and a very clever author, test our imaginations and take us on an interesting physical and spiritual journey.	2003-09-12

The class system is alive and well in Afghanistan and Hassan and his father are members of a detested caste called Hazara.  Despite the fact that Hassan and his father are beloved by Amir's father and treated well, the distinction is pervasive.<br />Amir's mother died giving birth to him and Hassan's mother abandoned him following his birth.  The two youngsters are inseparable but there is a prevalent jealousy on the part of Amir because of his father's affection for the servant boy.  There are long, luxurious times for games, books and flights of the imagination.  Amir uses these opportunities to lord certain things over Hassan...his inability to read, for example.  Hassan has no idea that Amir purposely digresses in certain tales he's reading to his best friend...makes up endings that nonetheless thrill Hassan.  He's impressed by his friend and nothing is too great for his young master.  His admiration is endless and the taunts and beratings are easily and frequently forgiven.<br />Amir's father is a formidable man, powerful, fair, just and impressive.  Because of his evenhandedness and generosity he reminds the reader of a benevolent \\"Godfather\\", with many in his debt.  Compliments for his son are rare and Amir's belief is that Hassan is more favored by his father because of the child's athletic prowess. After all Amir's father, a bear of a man, was reputed to have successfully wrestled a bear and was also an impressive soccer player. <br />Hassan's athletic ability manifests when he is a \\"kite runner\\".  Kite flying contests are an annual event in Kabul.  It calls for skill and strategy.  The two boys make a winning team and Amir wipes out the opposition, ably assisted by his young servant who feeds just the correct amount of glass-coated string to Amir so that he can slice through the opposition.  Next comes an equally impressive task; to successfully track down the kite of the finalist who is eventually defeated by the champion.  Hassan has the reputation of having an innate talent for knowing just where the kite will land and he goes in hot pursuit of Amir's trophy that is yet elusive as it floats across the sky.<br />It is here boyhood and joy come to a brutal climax.  Hassan is tracked and viciously attacked by another class of boys who rape him in retaliation for his having defended Amir on a previous occasion.  Amir hides and views the rape from a protected spot.  From this point onward, Amir is all the more convinced of his ineptitude, cowardice and an acceptance of the fact that he cannot ever live up to the expectations of his father.  It's no wonder he seems to favor Hassan!  To add insult to injury, Amir begins to treat Hassan even more harshly, avoiding him, asking his father to replace the boy and his father.  Obviously Amir's shame is multliplied whenever he sees his friend and staunch defender who yet must wait on him and prepare some of his meals.  Frequently, Amir thinks of the blood that was on the ground following the rape.<br />Kabul's history of wars takes precedence in the story from this point on and culminates with the present destructive reign of the corrupt Taliban.  Amir and his father have fled to the United States, to California, and word of Hassan and his father reaches Amir many years later.<br />Because of his strong bond with another of his father's friends, his only apparent adult supporter throughout his childhood, Amir returns to Kabul to see the friend who is in failing health.  It is at this point that he learns the fate of Hassan, his wife, his father and Hassan's son.<br />A number of improbabilities occur that make for exciting reading, nevertheless.  More brutality occurs and the reader learns of the corruption and treachery of the Taliban.  It seems inconceivable to a western reader that those espousing religious beliefs and absolute devotion to Allah are capable of such horrors!  Enlightenment seems to bypass many religions!<br />The ending isn't a happy one; it's just an ending with some promise and some hope.  Because of the horrors Hassan's son experiences, how can a satisfactory ending even take place?<br />This is a good effort for a first novel.  It is an absorbing read, gripping at times but a plot that's hard to resolve.  It is instructive and all the more appropriate at this time when the United States is a committed participant in the war against the Taliban in a country that's been devastated by so many forces.	2003-08-19

And time is a critical element in this novel whose beginning paints a very insular setting, the small-scale world according to<BR>Mrs. Ramsay. The season is summer and it is an annual event that she, her husband and eight children, a coterie of Mr. Ramsay's academic-type admirers and a spinster with a love of painting, adjourn to the Ramsay's seaside household. <br />The story's unfolding is mirrored in the manner of Mrs. Ramsay's thinking...all internal: about her husband; her children; their family friends; an anticipated engagement; marriage in general and her own in particular; and her husband's preoccupation with his academic career. Without a doubt, Mrs. Ramsay is the glue that holds this little, private cocoon together.<br />Mr. Ramsay, succinctly put, is self-centered. He's introspective; he's occupied with his achievements; and \\"reaching Z\\" is an all-absorbing goal! Contemplative walking and pacing seem to be among his favorite pastimes and his amblings provide him more space to contemplate \\"I, I, I\\" as aptly described by Lily Briscoe, an amateur artist. At times it seems as if being the father of eight, even though his wife shields him from much of the routine of family life... including household expenses...serves as a hindrance to his further achievements. He is a man of logic and will not even tolerate his youngest child's yearnings to go to the lighthouse because the weather on the following day will most assuredly not \\"be fine\\" as Mrs. Ramsay tries to assure the child it will be.<br />There is an occasional sadness and distance about Mrs. Ramsay that manifests following her husband's frequent petulant scenes. Nonetheless she plays her roles to absolute perfection: mother, wife, and nurturer to all including their guests. She sees their shortcomings but accepts them and fosters each in her own way according to their perceived needs.<br />Women are relegated to minor roles; it is the men who are the intelligent ones. And Mr. Ramsay conjectures that much of what his wife reads she may not understand. Yet the couple loves one another... each person according to his own capacity. Mrs. Ramsay is obviously her husband's fan, the one who bolsters him and protects and nurtures him...and the reader is privy to all her thoughts accordingly. There is a glimmer, too, of her disappointment in him, his self-centeredness and his sole reliance on logic.<br />Age (a mechanism employed to show the passage of time) is also a theme in \\"To the Lighthouse\\". Mrs. Ramsay was a beauty, is yet considered a beauty despite her age. Her aging husband, however, is still considered handsome and attracts and welcomes female attention...female flattery. This is appropriate for a man; a woman may gain admiration for her skills and her looks but it would be inappropriate to call attention to herself. <br />The world of children, weather, guests and their idiosyncrasies, Mrs. Ramsay's desire that things remain the same thus assuring her children never having to grow up to face life's problems, takes a huge leap and the reader is propelled from the previous protected cocoon into \\"real life\\".<BR>Mrs. Ramsay dies, son Andrew perishes in World War I, her daughter Prue is escorted down the aisle by her father, and one year later dies giving birth. Yet, the author is ingenious about holding fast to the internal world of the characters, with only an occasional external utterance.<br />Everything has changed. Without the foundational piece, the cement that holds the household and extended household together, the summer place is abandoned, dusty, rotting, decrepit, unattended. No one has vacationed there for 10 years. Subsequently, orders are generated to a former household staff member to re-open the house for a smaller onslaught of visitors.<br />Nothing is the same without Mrs. Ramsay. She is mourned, especially by Lily Briscoe. Only three of the Ramsay children have accompanied their father to thesummer retreat. He is still the bully that he was in their childhood. Their world still operates according to his moods, whims and orders. James and Cam, now 16 and 17, are morose and it always seems as if they are waiting for the \\"other shoe to drop\\". Nothing must go awry or their aged father will be irritated and critical. <br />Mr. Ramsay's preoccupation is still with himself and it is the guests' duty to pity him, fawn over him and focus their attention on the pain dealt him. Lily Briscoe refuses to do this (she is adamant that marriage, as espoused by Mrs. Ramsey as a must, is not necessarily so). She braces herself to deliberately focus her efforts on her art and its composition. She seeks balance in a painting that just doesn't seem to come together. This could be deemed symbolic of a search for balance in her own life and a challenge to attain some personal resolution to her grief over<BR>Mrs. Ramsay's death.<br />\\"To a Lighthouse\\" is a masterpiece; it succeeds as a group and character portrait While a difficult \\"read\\", the story, the plot, the character definition, and the passage of time...largely accomplished through internal dialogue... is ingenious!	2003-08-03

Queen Noor obviously meant this book to be a tribute to her late husband, King Hussein of Jordan.  It is equally obvious that because she willingly changed her religious affiliation to that of Islam, and embraced the Arab ways, she views the Western world very differently.<br />She was a child of privilege but sounds very down to earth, a loving mother to her own biological offspring, as well as to Hussein's children by his previous three marriages.  Queen Noor describes her total immersion into the Arab ways, an appreciation for its customs, culture, history, its people, their craftsmanship, art, architecture and their political hardships.<br />She sought to improve the rights of women, collaborated with international non-governmental organizations to improve the health of Jordan's children and to highlight the artistic capabilities of local women weavers.  The Queen even found start-up monies for some women so that they could assist in the financial support of their own families via their own small businesses.<br />The first part of the book is bland and is fundamentally story telling.  The writing is simply meant to be informative.  It is when Hussein's exhausting efforts to mediate a Middle East peace plan that her own unique perspectives take on a more interesting tone.  She claims that the US perspective and sympathies are always with what is described as the beleaguered and battered Israelis.  The Queen speaks of the Israeli transgressions against the Palestinian people and the Israelis' persistent usurping of still further lands, in direct opposition to United Nations agreements.<br />The book grows all the more emotional as a number of Hussein's endeavours fail, even when various factions pledge their cooperation; all these elements seem to lead to the king's decline in health (he apparently substantially increased his smoking), the discovery of cancer and his eventual death. This is a narrative that's told by a devoted wife who both loved and greatly admired her husband and his advocacy efforts in behalf of his country and of the Palestinian people.<br />The Queen also engages in a great deal of name dropping, naming royalty, politicians, presidents and their wives and their receptivity or coolness toward her in their varying associations.  Although she treats Libyan dictator Quadaffi as a quirky person, Saddam Hussein and Yasser Arafat as increasingly recalcitrant men, she describes the US as definite contributors to the conflagrations in the Middle East. <br />If the Queen was attempting to humanize the Arabs and to sympathetically treat their plight with the many injustices done to them, she has succeeded.  As an aside, I think the reader would like to have known how Noor's own life changed subsequent to her husband's death.  Seeing Prince Abdullah, Hussein's eldest son and the offspring of his first wife, became the king, Noor would no longer be queen.  How did that affect her works with and for the people of Jordan?	2003-07-07

Professor Nafisi is a gifted storyteller.  Her language is strong, compelling, descriptive, engaging and she switches roles as the story unfolds.  She re-lives the role of professor at Tehran University where registered and unregistered students came to her classes because of their reputation for excellence.  Some of her students even returned to those classes after having completed them.  How many professors can boast of that!<br />Then Professor Nafisi the woman emerges, an insulted, enraged, persecuted woman who is part of a larger society of women whom Iran's leader, the Imam Khomeini, felt must be protected, covered from head to toe, so that all possible Western influences would be expunged from them.  Then she switches to her professorial role and describes the various Western authors who formed the basis of her literature classes.  They represented ideas diametrically opposed to the professed ideals of Islam.  Freedom of thought is dangerous and a university, including Tehran University where Professor Nafisi taught, must excise from its classrooms all opportunities for learning such ideas of abomination. <br />Azar Nafisi the woman, the teacher, was a fighter; she refused to wear the veil and ultimately left Tehran University, choosing to give up a beloved profession rather than become part of a destructive force to wrench freedom of thought from students. <br />From the perspective of Western society it seems incomprehensible that a government would have the gall to tell women that their eyelashes are too long; fruit is being ingested too suggestively; an offending tiny piece of hair is showing from under the veil; the fabric of the diaphanous robes is too thin; to enact a law that the acceptable age of marriage for a woman is in her adolescence!  Yet the chokingly oppressive rule of the Islamic Fundamentalists was able to enforce these offensive dictums!<br />It's no wonder that Professor Nafisi chose to clandestinely meet in her home with some of her former female students to discuss the forbidden:  Nabokov, Austen, Fitzgerald, James.  When all has been robbed from an individual, there must be a way to hold onto one's soul and for the Professor it was her love of language, thought and freedom of expression.  For the young women it was a powerful desire to live and operate outside the veil.  Once in her home, the young women would shed their covering to display colorful earrings, tee shirts and jeans.<br />\\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" was all the timelier because of America's involvement in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  It is imperative that we Americans, who often take liberty too far, recognize that in other parts of the world even one's mind belongs to imperious rulers who claim to be champions of purity and holiness!<br />The one criticism I have of this book is that it's chronology; the skipping around from living room to classroom and various parts of history from the 80's to '97 makes it hard to piece the whole puzzle together.  The chronology is disjointed.<br />One final comment, it would be ideal for the reader to have read the works of the authors so valued by Professor Nafisi in order to fully understand and appreciate her analysis of them, the ideas they were professing, and the parallels she was drawing between these ideas and the destructive beliefs being foisted by the Islamic Revolution in Iran.	2003-06-13

A favorite tumbler; a metronome that is an integral tool to Rudy's composing skills; a richly-grained wooden chair with a beautiful, tapestried pillow; an answering machine with Rudy's voice that Christina cannot bring herself to erase.<br />The chair keeps cropping up because Rudy, as his disease progressed, required sitting in an upright position and was probably all the more visible because of his forced confinement.  Drawings, too, of the living room and descriptions of how they sat in proximity to one another, emphasize their closeness.  They were woven together as a couple, as best friends, as collaborators in the co-creation of their home and individual work spaces...she an author...he a composer.<br />Christina chronicles her pain without being mawkish.  No matter where she turns, the memories are present and what makes the agony still worse is that on the night of Rudy's death, she had unsuspectingly left to return home and was reading as Rudy was dying.  Sadly, she recalls that she will never be able to read that author again.  No matter how many moments were spent together, from their grand passion when they first met, to the quieter times, the intimacy that grew over the years, there was never enough because it's now all gone...forever!  It cannot be re-created.<br />Religion is of some comfort to Christina, as are some friends, one of whom zeroes in on her drinking but it is in the seeking and in the finding of her ownway that Christina can continue.  And there are no easy answers, no and \\"she lived happily ever after\\".  The final passage contains comforting words from Rudy, one of many things Christina recalls that he said.  Memories are blissful, funny, poignant and pierce like a weapon!<br />This is undoubtedly one of the most intimate books I have read on grief and loss.  There are many on how to deal with grief; how to become financially capable; how to resume dating; how to tell children about the death of their parent but this one is truly unique in its ability to deal with the simple, pure aching that occurs when a loved one with whom one has shared so much is removed from one's life.  It is like major surgery with no anesthesia during the surgery or painkillers to dull the agony following the procedure!	2003-05-22

Her fantasies usually revolve around heroines, falls from glory and happy endings.  Performing her dramas is also one of Briony's passons and \\"The Fall of Arabella\\" was to be the latest production, done in honor of her college-age brother's return from school.<br />The description of the preparations, including role rehearsals by less-than-talented cousins, easily enamor the reader to precocious Briony.  That changes dramatically when one of her cousins, Lola, is ... assaulted shortly after Briony witnessed an intimate scene between her sister Cecelia and a would-be lover, Robbie Turner. <br />Robbie Turner is the son of the Tallis family's charlady and has been a favorite of the head of the Tallis household...so much so that Robbie has been college educated by the senior Tallis and he has also agreed to fund Robbie's subsequent medical education.  As an aside, it is interesting to see that the British social structure is such that Mrs. Tallis finds such financial backing of someone from the servant class to be inappropriate.  For that matter, the education of her eldest daughter, Cecelia, seems a waste of money as well.  The quest for an appropriate husband is far more important!<br />Briony utilizes her flair for the dramatic and her penchant for heroics to decide that Robbie has assaulted her sister and the dark figure she witnessed running away from her cousin's assault scene could be no other than Robbie.  He is arrested, even though Briony immediately begins to doubt her own pronouncements, and Robbie spends several years in prison.<br />Time is then propelled forward to Robbie's participation in World War II and the flight from Dunkirk.  Cecelia is a nurse and Briony is a nursing student, exposed to the brutalities of war as critically injured men are returned from the front.  Briony lives the full brunt of her guilt, knowing full well who her cousin's true assailant is.<br />The ending of the story takesan interesting turn and it is for the reader to discover.  Briony is in her seventies; she knows that her life is nearing its end.  She is a famous author with a book that cannot be published during her lifetime.  Therein lies the twist and the reader is left to his/her imagination!<br />The story is slow moving at times and is more interesting through the war years, Briony's final confrontation of her own guilt and the destruction she has caused within her own family.	2003-04-28

A highly structured, advanced society where everyone has a role and no one has a need to rebel.  That is the environs into which Jonas is born.  Every year of his life, in the life of any inhabitant of this unnamed city, there is an assigned role with accompanying tasks, an obligatory training to prepare for the twelfth year in which a person receives her or his life's profession.<br />In such an idyllic location it is interesting to note that those who are assigned to give birth are looked down upon; after two years of giving life to babes who will be subsequently assigned to parents who are allowed only one boy and one girl, the woman is assigned to various other chores.  She is a lifegiving machine who maintains the population of the community but her ensuing role is that of some type of common laborer.  No rewards for this profession!<br />There are those who do the cooking and deliver meals to all of the inhabitants, those who clean up after the food has been ingested and trays left outside the home, those who are teachers, those who are nurturers, those who are caregivers to the elderly and those who are assigned legal tasks.  The penalty for non-compliance, or non-conformity, is \\"release\\".  By itself the word is innocuous enough.  What it actually means, is hazy.  Finally, at some point in time the elderly must be released and the decision is made for them.<br />Big Brother is always watching and reminders are issued via an intercom.  Faults and mis-steps seem to be gently dealt with but \\"release\\" is the ultimate verdict once a certain amount of opportunities for correction have elapsed.  Dreams are processed each day as are feelings of anger, hostility, frustration.  Reasons for behaviour are evaluated and the reason appears to be that if feelings can be processed a homeostasis will always return.  Lying is strictly forbidden...until....<br />When the twelfth year finally arrives, a bizarre occurrence takes place.  Jonas and all his contemporaries who are about to turn 12, are called to an auditorium at which time they revert to the numbers they were originally assigned, prior to the \\"name giving\\" that occurred when they were officially presented to their selected parents.  Jonas is not called to the stage when his number is called.  He is shocked as are all the members of the town who are present for this important occasion.<br />The reason for the slight becomes apparent when Jonas receives the highest honor possible, he will become \\"The Receiver\\".  His studies with the present Receiver reveal a far-from-perfect society and it is each subsequent Receiver who must be the recipient of the painful memories of the past.  This takes its toll on each honoree as s/he literally bears the weight of the world in order to alleviate the town's folk from having to do so.<br />Jonas gradually rebels and takes dramatic steps to escape what is not at all idyllic.  Let the reader discover this moral tale.  The novel is well done and can easily appeal to adults and adolescents alike.  The fortunate adolescents will have adults with whom to review this book as it has many painful, ethical, moral issues to be discussed!	2003-04-28

It is Robert Langdon who lives the conflict and deals with the confusion of imbedded art codes that are the crux of the plot's conundrum.<br />Robert Langdon, also a renowned expert, is a symbologist who is implicated in the murder as his name plainly appears in a message left by the murder victim for his niece Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist with the French police.  What follows is a whirlwind tour of some of England's and Scotland's famous churches, temples and chapels...all in the name of pursuing and deciphering the clever and encrypted messages left by the deceased.<br />As Robert, and his accomplice Sophie Neveu, both attempt to clear their names as apparent partners in crime, they simultaneously pursue the clues left by Sophie's grandfather, a dignitary in a historically mysterious group, Opus Dei.  To divulge too much is to spoil the whirlwind pursuit that sweeps the reader along.  What can be divulged, however, is that Opus Dei devotees are worshippers of a religion in which the ancient goddess is a central part, in direct conflict with Sons of Sion, also a secret society that is slavishly devoted to the basic tenets of the Catholic Church, with no improvisations.<br />Interesting and provocative art and church history unfold along with the parallel plot precipitated by  \\"The Teacher\\".  That's one of the closely-kept secrets!  Who is The Teacher?  Yes, it's a page turner.  Agreed, it's a cannotputterdowner!	2003-04-22

The imaginativeness, the tenacity and endurance required to bring about the creation of a  \\"White City\\" (Chicago's World Fair of 1893) is synonymous with the qualities required of an author to research and structure a truly quality book such as \\"Devil in the White City\\".  Like \\"Seabiscuit\\" the narrative could easily have fallen into a journalistic and documentary style.  Neither book succumbed.  The tension and intrigue kept both books on the edge, real page turners!<br />That requires talent.  When the reader becomes as burdened and frustrated as the chief architect, Burnam, because of endless details, fiscal issues and political infighting, the author turns to the evildoer, Holmes/Mudgett, and without being morbid leads the reader through the intricacies of his madness.<br />What makes this book even more engrossing is that the author treats both of the principal characters as architects.  Burnham is engaged in the planning of a city that will thrill and awe the world and Holmes is planning a hotel that will serve as a snare, execution chamber and crematorium.<br />Adversaries abound.  In Chicago, as the White City emerges, the weather takes center stage, as do fires, and inhospitable grounds that won't support the huge structures being planned.  That's when still further human inventiveness emerges and novel architectural techniques are born.<br />Holmes actually has an easier job with his adversaries.  His smooth, psychopathic personality enables him to lie and charm his way out of satisfying his league of debtors and desperate families seeking women and children whom he has actually butchered.<br />The reader will be kept on edge throughout this sizable tome, just waiting to see how Holmes (Mudgett deliberately named himself after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character) will meet his match, justice and his Maker.  What has not been recognized till lately is that Holmes actually obliterated more people than did Jack the Ripper who gained far more notoriety.<br />Theresearch that went into this book is impressive, as the back of the book will attest.  Finally, as an interesting aside, the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 gave birth to a number of products and a form of entertainment we take for granted today...Juicy Fruit Gum, Shredded Wheat and the Ferris Wheel.  The Ferris Wheel was created to outdo the Eiffel Tower that was the centerpiece of the Paris World's Fair that had immediately preceded the Chicago World's Fair.	2003-03-28

The jailbird is Rosaleen, the only woman who has shown her any caring and nurturing since the death of her own mother.<br />Lily has an enormous burden to shoulder.  Not only did she assist Rosaleen to escape what probably would have been her own murder by town racists who didnt want to see blacks as registered voters, but she carries a greater burdenthat of being the accused killer of her own mother.  T. Ray, not called daddy because he doesnt act like one according to Lily, doesnt mind adding to Lilys pain by reminding her that Deborah Owens, his wife, was in the process of abandoning both of them on the day she was killed by a gun that was dropped to the floorand picked up by a tiny Lily who only remembers the terrible sound that followed!<br />With nowhere to go Lily and Rosaleen head for Tiburon, South Carolina.  Why?  Because all Lily has as mementos of her mother are a picture of the Black Madonna pasted to a piece of wood with the words Tiburon, South Carolina written on the back and a pair of gloves belonging to Deborah Owens.<br />The turbulence and violence of the Civil Rights movement are an important and  re-occurring part of the background tapestry in the story but dont often take front stage.  Of greater importance is the rich cast of characters Lily encounters in Tiburon.  After hitchiking to South Carolina, Lily finds the Black Madonna is in actuality a mysterious label on a local stores ample supply of  Black Madonna Honeya product of a local beekeeper, August Boatwright.<br />August is one of three sisters, including May and June (Aprils tragic story is briefly told), a close-knit family devoted to learning, music and beekeeping.

Getting rid of another mouth to feed is his goal.  Anna is married young and is widowed shortly thereafter.  Her only respite from her terrible loneliness, especially after the death of her two babes, is the hours she spends in the home of Reverend Mompellion.  He is a pensive, studious man, married to a gentle, nature loving wife, Elinor.  Anna knows her place as a servant and at first finds it uncomfortable to respond to the friendly overtures made by her employer's wife, who also teaches Anna to read.<br />Elinor is an enthusiastic gardener and has a growing interest in the herbs being cultivated by an ostracized family of women who are suspected of being witches, despite the fact that many of their herbal preparations have proven beneficial to the local villagers.  From the beginning of this engaging novel the reader experiences a growing tension and increasing realization that something will happen to this tiny village and its mostly poor inhabitants.  And that \\"something\\" is the Bubonic plague that in reality struck an actual English village upon which this story is based.<br />Anna is so key a character that it is within her household that the person carrying the plague, a vagabond-type tailor, actually sets in motion the larger plot.  How will persons of varying socioeconomic levels and belief systems deal with a plague?  Will it force some to rely on their destructive superstitions?  Will it be a catapult to positive change?  What will its devastating force do to the small minded, the idealistic, the religious minded?<br />These questions are all dealt with in this beautifully written novel.  Reverend Mompellion is a good, idealistic man.  Because he's educated, he and his wife are invited to the homes of some of the area wealthy.  It is at these gatherings that he first learns that those \\"who have\\" will flee the area for London, expecting to escape suffering and death.  Because the plague struck during 1655 and 1666, there was no understanding that the Bubonic Plague was carried by fleas from infected rats.  Undoubtedly, escaping the poor, dirty peasants would bring a higher social strata some insurance from being affiliated with and, therefore, infected by the underclass!<br />Death escapes no family.  Some are decimated within days.  Yet various neighbors assist one another, nurse one another, one another's children...and ultimately bury them.  Others are convinced the witches are the cause of the plague; a murder takes place.  All the while Reverend Mompellion keeps his head and is a strong, persistent leader who convinces his parishoners of two things: God is testing them; and they should voluntarily quarantine themselves so as not to spread the plague any further.<br />Reverend Mompellion strikes a deal with a leader of a neighboring community to bring food and supplies to a certain point beyond which none of the villagers will stray.  The community continually shrinks as its inhabitants die in increasing numbers.  Church services are eventually stopped indoors, hoping lack of close proximity will quell the plague.  Services are held for decimated numbers outside.  Yet, Reverend Mompellion prevails in his unflagging belief in God....until tragedy strikes his own household and his own faith is crushed.<br />The novel's ending is very much a surprise.  As I earlier indicated, some grow in knowledge, spirit, understanding and generosity.  Others do not!  Belief systems are shaken but the results are not necessarily negative!  Well written; well told; engrossing!	2002-10-11

Two young women, both with little ones in tow, meet by chance in a park.  From that brief beginning an unusual relationship is begun.  I say \\"unusual\\" because it does not appear, over the 20 years that are briefly described, to have a lot of glue.  The conversations are in bits `n snatches and switch topics rapid fire.  Reuben (and we never quite learn why this character is only occasionally referred to by her first name, Toby) seems to be the adversarial, critical one and Deborah seems to be the target.<br />Both women teach part time, yet Reuben is critical of Deborah's style, her lack of preparedness for classes, and the cursory way she apparently skims over the subject matter with her students.  So what keeps drawing these two women together?  Reuben at times appears jealous of Deborah and her friendship with another teacher.  Ultimately she contributes to Deborah's being laid off because of an off-handed remark to the woman who does the hiring and firing.<br />A more interesting part of this book is its journeys back to the 20s when Gussie Lipkin was a rebel and an activist.  Her demonstration activities in behalf of the failing trolley industry end in a trolley derailment, the death of her sister and in a trial from which she is acquitted.<br />I found myself wondering what the link was between Reuben who literally borrows the book that narrates Gussie's life and rebellious activities and Reuben's own life and times.  This remains obscure for more than half the book, although there are hints of danger and possible injury or death; but the worries are more mothers' worries in behalf of their own vulnerable little ones.<br />The conversation between the two women is choppy, sometimes prickly, and most of the time \\"all over the place\\".  Again the question, what bonded these two women for twenty years?  Nonetheless when Deborah dies in a car accident just after the two women's confrontation as they hiked one evening, Reuben is devastated and that's the point at which the depth of her love for Deborah is more fully articulated.  Moreover it is from this point onward that the extent of the friendship becomes more evident and believable.  Until that point, Reuben seemed the distant of the two women, the more cerebral.  Following Deborah's death, the memories of little things came flooding back (and perhaps it's the little things that formed the elusive glue to the relationship?)...the places visited...the lunches they shared.  And Reuben is desolate!<br />It is at this point that Gussie re-enters the story; she is still very much alive, frail and living alone..in need of caregiving.  Her rebelliousness during the mostly un-chronicled portion of her life was manifested in large, abstract sculptures, pieces that are literally crushing her old home.<br />Reuben is fascinated with Gussie a.k.a. Berry and it seems to be this fascination for an aged, spunky, iconoclastic sculptor that provides more mystery than answers to the story.  Did Gussie really kill her sister?  Will Gussie and Berry becomes friends?  Will Gussie provide some sort of solace for Reuben?  She is quite an iconoclast and doesn't seem given to sympathy.  Hers is more of a \\"get on with it\\" attitude.  Is that what Reuben needs?<br />Some of the most shocking questions nonetheless remain: Was Deborah really having an affair?  And why did she never confide in Reuben?	2002-10-08

Interestingly, she also seems to have a knack for describing how lives are subsequently changed, how some survivors become stronger, how others suffer to the point of illness and how still others are resentful of the unspoken ghost that pervades family life in the ensuing years.<br />Though very clever, the story at times becomes extremely fanciful and syrupy as Susie keeps wondering what her romantic life would have been like.

Her post mortem seduction of the now grown and college educated student who had given her the first kiss is just one of those \\"far out\\" moments!<br />Susie has also had an unexpected impact upon another earthling, Ruth, one of the proverbial unpopular high school girls to be found in most adolescent settings.

Miriam Hanoum's queendom is inhabited by nosey neighbors upon whom she is always wishing various plagues and ills because of past or anticipated injuries.<br />Miriam's daughter Flora is both her pride and her personal bane.  She is pretty, spoiled, disobedient...and pregnant by a ne'er do well husband who has \\"skipped town\\".  Nazie is the story's Cinderella, orphaned by Miriam's in-laws.

However, her diminutive size, very young age and lack of menses make her ineligible.  Moussa, the Hanoum's only son, will be her eventual spouse when proof can be established that she is physically ready, in other words can bear children.<br />The plot to this story is very thin.  It is the cultural aspects and the humourous ways in which they are related that make it readable.  Because it is a translation, the reader also wonders what's missing.  What is it that I don't understand about time, place, culture and traditions that would give me more of a framework for additional appreciation?<br />The most enjoyable part of the novel comes at its very end, when poor, pregnant, bloated Flora goes in search of her smelly, ignorant, yet very wily groom.

Indeed, for a considerable part of the story the Old World seems to predominate and the family's tales of woe and dysfunction head towards resolution in an all-of-a-sudden manner with little transition.<br />Unlike Barbara Kingsolver's style of dealing with each character individually, giving each character a voice that clearly gives the reader insight into who s/he is and what that character's individual worldview is (as in &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot;), Rabinyan's characters are vague and we get to know them from a hazy vantage point, that of Iran, their mother.<br />She's given to hysterics, loves them and addresses them as \\"my soul\\" yet screams and yells about their decisions, their manner of dress, attitudes, and behaviour.  Her raison d'etre seems to center around their eventual marriages.  Some might think this is a mother's role, yet Iran's indiosyncratic demeanor doesn't endear her to the reader.  Her covering the emotional spectrum of loving attention culminates too frequently with tirades directed to each daughter, to the exclusion of Maurice the firstborn and only son.  Perhaps because Iran was so young and unsophisticated, she greets his arrival in this world with hysterics about his lack of tears when he cries and considers him dead because he also has no heart.<br />The only voice of reason is Solly's, her husband.  Though a lowly fisherman, he's sensible and loves his children for who they are and seems all but oblivious to the constant turmoil in his household.   Iran is the driving force in Solly's life and the life of his family.  Though she declines in looks and in her personal care as a result of being overwhelmed by her children's dramas, he's still as mad about her as when he first laid eyes on Iran as she walked along the seaside in Persia (Iran).<br />The characteristics of each of the Azizyan children border on the bizarre.  More than one of them is described as sad or having sad eyes.  The surviving Whirling Dervish of a twin lives in her own world with her deceased brother and as a result is sent away to an institution where she is kept zombie like on Ritalin.  One sister falls out of love with her husband the day after the wedding although she's pined for him for years; the same sister sleeps throughout her ceremony as a result of an overdose of sleeping pills.  Is it any wonder that the reader has a hard time understanding what they are all about and why?<br />Equally bizarre is the fact that this is an interesting book because of the quirkiness of the storytelling with its disjointed, sometimes hard-to-follow, chronology of events.	2002-07-24

His mom was a wild, music loving, hard drinking young woman who hailed from a Pentacostal family...although a number of its members love their liquor, cigarettes and cards more than revival meetings!<br />Once he reaches the age of 18, Clay strikes out on his own but frequently drifts back to the aunt who raised him, Easter, for the comfort of her presence, her homemade meals, and his roots...even though they may seem obscured at times.  The pull of family connections and belonging exert a strong influence with him!<br />The author keeps us guessing about Anneth, Clay's mother.  A box of her belongings mysteriously appears one day on Easter's porch.  Clay is given the box, when the moment seems right, and it is his exploration of the its contents, along with more details from Easte Anneth's sister, that assists in his re-building fleeting memories of her.  There is snow, blood, cold, a frightening flight from an assailant...and the old memories of his mother cease there!<br />Despite the fact that Clay's seeming pursuit of wine, women and song appears to be pretty normal for a young man his age, he has a strongly introspective side.  He also has a love of classical music, and a spiritual connection to the lushness of the changing seasons in the \\"holler\\" in which he was raised.  \\"Cake\\", his best buddy, is the real party animal and it seems as though Clay just goes along for the ride till he can find whatever his soul is really in pursuit of.<br />That pursuit culminates in his eventual meeting with a talented \\"fiddle player\\", Alma, the daughter of a devout \\"hell, fire and brimstone\\" family known for their church-related musical abilities.  Like some of Clay's relatives, religion has faded in importance to Alma and her wild sister, Evangeline.  Alma is about to become a divorcee, which is strictly forbidden in her church.<br/>The dysfunctional relationship that led to Anneth's eventual murder are mirrored in Alma's relationship with her about-to-be-ex-husband.  Alma, on more than one occasion, expresses her fear that her husband just won't allow her to be happy and that has implications for the developing relationship with Clay.<BR> <BR>The beauty of this story is its talented writer's skillful blending of nature and human relationships including the strong, the dysfunctional, and the quirky.  As the story and its mysteries unfold, the reader realizes that a virtual quilt is being pieced together, much as one of the story's characters, Uncle Paul, is constantly carefully selecting appropriate pieces and colors with which to weave together his own quilts.	2002-07-17

Hillenbrand has done her homework, as the documentation at the end of the book demonstrates.  She is both a thorough researcher and a spellbinding storyteller!  The reader is literally swept along; at times it seems as if the racedays' \\"play-by-plays\\" pull us along at breakneck speeds, the tension building until one wants to scream \\"Just tell me who won!\\"<br />There are episodes where we root for Seabiscuit because he is to horses what underdogs are to boxing and other sports.  The reader so badly wants him to win that there is genuine disappointment, mounting excitement, crestfallen emotions, heart-pounding wins, teeth-grinding almost wins, horrifying accidents and finally, tears when the champion is just the older \\"Pops\\".<br />One of the other facets of this straightforwardly told, multi-dimensioned saga covering the lives and idiosyncrasies of owners, jockeys and trainers, is the abuse of the jockeys.  Their masterful and intuitive, akin-to-racedriver skills, are absolutely essential to the wins.  And wealthy owners require impressive, record-breaking wins to boost both their own worth, as well as to further the reputation of their steeds.  The horses are far more pampered, at least during the historical period of Seabiscuit's era, than the jockeys.  The jockeys, were often young, poor and poorly educated youths who were sparsely paid.  They had no health insurance, considering the catastrophes that could easily befall them and often did, and these boys...if they survived to have longer careers...indulged in self starvation and other eyebrow raising methods to maintain ultra-low weights (especially for males) during their racing seasons.<br />There's cause to raise eyebrows even further when considering the horses.  \\"Imposts\\" were raised as a horse got to be a seasoned winner, supposedly to even the stakes a little for the other horses running the races with them.  As Seabiscuit became a recognized marvel, increasing weight was added to his raceday load.   Because horses are natural-born runners, the expectation is that he would run his heart out nonetheless.  But money, prestige, and not a little insider politics cum bias were the driving forces behind the practice.<br />There's more than one temptation to skip ahead and see if our hero, Seabiscuit, will win various races especially the Santa Anita, but the tension and suspense in the storytelling are so good that the details are worth every word!  What a story; what a horse!  He may have been less beautiful than others, less well built and looking more like a \\"cow pony\\" but he was a champion.  What a book!	2002-07-08

She was too tall as a child; her mother died when she was very young and her prominent father, a small-town doctor, drummed it into the heads of both Codi and her little sister, Hallie, that they were different from the rest.  His emphasis was \\"above the rest.\\"  Their interpretation was \\"different\\".  Yet, each daughter develops differently despite this constant message from her father.<br />Doc Homero, as he was known, demonstrated his caring by enforcing rules, rules, and more rules.  Nothing much escaped his scrutiny, including his enforced wearing of what both growing girls felt were unstylish, \\"orthopedic shoes.\\"  In Doc Homero's mind this was his contribution to healthy feet.<br />Both girls longed for hugs and demonstrations of affection, which were never to happen.  Doc had his own personal battles...acceptance from the townspeople who remembered where and from whom he hailed.  All the more reason for Doc Homero to keep reinforcing to his girls that he was from Illinois.  I'll let the reader enjoy the unfolding of this mystery!<br />Hallie is a crusader for human rights, political justice and preservation of the land.  Here the reader will clearly see Kingsolver's activist sentiments, both from the understanding of a biologist's/environmentalist's perspective and also from the perspective of a political sympathizer who has seen historical injustices, as in the United State's role in Central America.  Hallie is the personification of Kingsolver's stance.<br />Codi, on the other hand, seems to hunker down and be perpetually absorbed with her lack of fitting in.  She seems to view herself as an oddity and exalts her sister's courage, drive and commitment.  Codi won't even accept a teacher's contract back in her hometown of Grace, for longer than a year.  And as she strikes up an intimate relationship with one of Grace's former Native American bad-boys-turned-good, she makes it clear she won't be around after school lets out for the summer.<br />Kingsolver's writing style is very engaging, it not only absorbs the reader in the plot but provides engaging characters as well, and also it educates the reader on Southwestern Native American culture, architecture, customs and folklore.<br />It would really spoil the discovery process for the reader to divulge how everyone and everything works out.  There is humour and sadness; there is beautiful imagery; there are both warm and passionate relationships; and there is personal discovery.<br />Beautifully done!	2002-06-26

Mount Fuji is accessible and a popular pilgrimmage, much like going to Mecca, but its ascent is deceptively easy as the first part of the route is made leisurely by car.  Once the hardy climber resumes the ascent on foot, the real trial becomes apparent.  Limbs begin to ache, the lungs become aware of the thinning atmosphere.  And the question then begs, \\"Can I really do this?\\"<br />Sara Backer draws a clever parallel between Mount Fuji's ascent and her own seemingly endless hurdles in acclimating to Japanese society, its maze of social subtleties, the intricacies of the language, and the prejudice against women, as the French put it \\"d'un certain age\\".  Gaby Stanton is a \\"December 26th cake\\".  She's unmarried and like the post-holiday cake is stale and undesirable!<br />She's smart, capable, and resourceful but was, nonetheless, fired from her job at a Japanese University.  The reason?  No one will tell her.  It seems the Japanese are ingenious at keeping information inaccessible.  And aggressive pursuit of this information would only further illustrate some of Americans' least appreciated characteristics.<br />A yakuza-fronted funeral establishment hires Gaby.  She has no knowledge of her boss' unsavory background; she just proceeds to do a good job for the only man who seems to accept her, as well as to encourage her successful sales efforts.<br />Because of her affiliation with the \\"Gone With The Wind\\" funeral home Gaby meets Alex Thorn and becomes involved in his personal quest to solve the mystery of his son's death.  A bill for the transport of Cody Thorn's body to America came on GWTW stationery.<br />Alex is at a very great disadvantage because he speaks no Japanese has no idea how to negotiate the twists, turns and subtleties of Japan's society.  His trip to Japan to promote his new self-help book is an opportunity to plumb the depths of his son's mysterious death and the delivery of the body to his grieving father...minus a heart.  <br />The author tellsa clever tale while explicating a complicated society, numerous characters, and confounding details leading to all kinds of suppositions, not all of which necessarily pan out as accurate!<br />Backer's heroine is spunky, compassionate, long suffering and doesn't lack for tenacity.  She puts aside her personal difficulties as she attempts to assist Alex Thorn with his own quest and grief.  A cleverly told tale!	2002-06-17

Kathleen DeBurca is on a quest, or rather on simultaneous quests.  One is to come to terms with her lonely life, the other is to solve the mystery surrounding the divorce of Lord Talbot from his adulteress wife during the latter 1800's.<br />The setting is Ireland and its tumultuous history during and post the famine years.  Kathleen leads the willing reader to a number of possible scenarios concerning the infamous divorce.  Was his Lordships's wife innocent, a schemer, wronged and lonely, or cunning?<br />Kathleen meets a cast of charming characters in the village to which she travels and holes up as she tries to unfathom the answers to her historical mystery.  Documents are discovered by the local librarian (another charming addition to the multiple-layered tale) in the village's library that allows Kathleen to change her estimation of Lady Talbot; then still more is discovered and the possible scenarios change again!<br />The story is peeled away layer upon layer and it's easy for the reader to wish Kathleen would \\"get on with it\\" when it comes to her own personal dilemmas, so that the Talbot plot can be once again re-entered and solved.

The end of the Victorian era is the setting for a social, historical commentary made engaging by two little girls who, by happenstance, meet at their families' gravesites.<br />Chevalier successfully moves the main characters, as well as peripheral characters, through ten years of social and familial upheavals.  The reader is swiftly moved along the ten-year journey, via brief, individual commentaries made from the perspectives of various major and minor players.  Interestingly, the very succinct perspectives, as voiced by such people as Richard Coleman, are as successful in mirroring his familial dissatisfactions and disapprovals as could have been conveyed in far longer passages.  Chevalier has excelled in distinctly sketching each character via his or her brief and individual insights and expressions.<br />She successfully depicts the inner life of maturing young girls, caught up in the changes of the era, of their individual and intertwined families.  Chevalier is also successful in illustrating the differences in social strata both among the two principal families and the lower social classes such as household servants and the cemetery staff.<br />All told, a fine read that moves along very rapidly through ten years because of the skillful style utilized by the author in whisking us along in a succinct, tightly woven style!	2002-01-23

But rest assured: this tragedy is not a fiction�	\\"A Fine Balance\\" is preceded by a quote by Honore de Balzac from \\"Le Pere Goriot\\".  Rohinton Mistry seems to be of a similar mind in forewarning his audience of readers that the poverty, misery, disdain for human life, and the inconsequentiality of human rights in a certain level of Indian society (the untouchables), is accurately portrayed.<br />Would-be readers should not, however, be dissuaded from reading this beautiful book, this complex, multi-layered story, because within the characters' misery and the squalor there also lies compassion, humour, patience, and hope.<br />The characters are vivid; some very endearing despite the fact that life is a non-stop, day-to-day struggle for mere survival.  Ishvar, especially, never seems to lose his good manners, his sense of gratitude for each kindness bestowed upon him, no matter how meager.  And since his nephew's welfare is of primary importance to him, Ishvar is engaged in an endless series of efforts to teach Omprakash good manners, tolerance and temperance.<br />The six-hundred-plus-pages fly by quickly as peripheral characters, including the wily, the greedy, the kind, the struggling and the ruthless, become an integral part of a tightly-woven tapestry representing incredible poverty and a portrayal of the survival of a despised class of people who are treated as sub-humans.	2002-01-17

The comparison is an inaccurate one.  \\"The Red Tent\\" is a rich tapestry comprised of its characters' lives and there is a natural flow in the character and his or her relationship to the overall biblically based story.  Both books undoubtedly embellish history where there is little or no recorded history.  However, \\"The Family Orchard\\" is much weaker in this respect.  Although the growing family tree's being illustrated with each chapter is helpful, as the story goes on the brevity of the chapters and the snapshots of the various characters, form weak building blocks.  \\"The Red Tent\\" gives the reader a very rich and full description of each character and that in turn is what makes the reader care about the characters.  Not true of \\"The Family Orchard\\".<br />Certainly, this was a clever endeavour.  To re-tell a family's history when so many facts are missing.

Each member strives for unattainable perfection.  Eliza does it through her prowess for spelling bees.  Aaron seeks his nirvana through his blossoming affiliation with the Hari Krishnas.  Saul, the family patriarch, seeks perfection through his religion, Judaism, with an emphasis on the works of Abulafia, a strange mystic.  Lastly, Saul's wife Miriam seeks her kaleidoscopic perfection (\\"perfectimundo\\") in a mysterious, bizarre ten-year-long -endeavour that is only revealed in the latter part of the novel.  The mystery is too good to tell and might spoil things for those who have yet to read the book!.<br />Eliza is the most pathetic character because of her age, and because of an emerging talent that Saul has only lately come to realize.  She becomes his mechanism in a further attempt at perfection.  Eliza evolves as his main focus, at the expense of her brother Aaron and his guitar lessons with Saul.  And sibling rivalry further alienates brother and sister who seemed to be one another's only childhood friend and companion.  <br />Eliza is literally grilled via the mystic Abulafia's method as a formula for achievement of higher order thinking.  Eliza is a vessel, a mound of clay to be shaped by her father, who seems to totally lose any realization of the fact that she is, first and foremost, a solitary, lonely little girl.  One of the most powerful parts of the story is when Eliza (\\"Jelly-Belly\\") loses her first big spelling bee because of Saul's cruel demonstration of his lack of faith in her abilities and tells her so.<br />The story is narrated in the third person which gives further credence and emphasis to the fact that each of the characters are so distant from one another.  A roof is all they seem to share!<br />Myla Goldberg has an outstanding storytelling style, including a superb command of the English language, and a fascinating capability to tell a story in a poignant, humorous, intelligent manner.	2001-08-14

In \\"Chalktown\\" she has managed to exceed the skills she demonstrated in her first novel, \\"Mother of Pearl.\\"  The author successfully describes a motley crew of characters with their problems, idiosyncrasies, faults, failings, strengths and charms.<br />Haynes vividly describes grinding poverty, lack of education and racism.  Hez, for example, is largely uneducated.  His preference is to skip as many school days as is allowable by the educational system.  Yet, for his apparent lack of smarts and social skills, he has heroic qualities.  A neglectful family, that can hardly be called a family at all, makes his caring and protectiveness of Yellababy his impaired brother, all the more difficult.  Fairy, the ostensible family head, spends more time with his former wife than with his present wife and children.  Wife and mother, Susan-Blair, has struggled with alcohol and her main means of survival seems to be her failed entrepreneurial efforts with a consignment business.  The family's one daughter is an on-again, off-again runaway who is headed for trouble because of her clandestine relationship with a mysterious county worker.<br />The characters are well drawn with all main characters having vivid personalities, quirks or charms.  Each chapter is short and seems to tease and urge the reader on to find out why \\"Chalktown\\" is so odd.  Why do folk only correspond via chalk and chalkboard?  Why are they so bound together even though some obviously harbor feelings of suspicion and hatred toward one another?  AND, who (really) dunnit?  <br />Even the ending is a surprise.
