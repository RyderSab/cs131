When I started this book, I hadn't heard anything about it, so I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be satirical, serious or what.  It turned out to be a family's story which can at times be both.  It is a good look at a family that manages to come together when it looks like all is lost.  A good thought provoking story that lets the reader see all sides of a situation.	2002-10-26

I love books, any genre, most authors, but I'm sorry to say that this book was quite a challenge.  It seemed to have promise in the beginning, but that's where it ended.  I didn't care about any of the characters, including Rachel, the so-called heroine of the story.  She goes to work for a shop that specializes in vintage clothing and happens to be there when some quilts arrive abandoned on the porch.  This could have been written to be creepy, mysterious, lots of different directions, but it went nowhere.  The author tried to weave a romance into the story, but that fell flat too.  What I really found annoying was the fact that Rachel was acting strangely on Christmas day, they caught her putting glass shards in the cranberries, and immediately the old grumpy guy knew it was the supernatural at work.  Now how was he so lucky to guess it right away?  I'd have called the cops and had her hauled away for attempted murder.  Anyway, I forced myself to finish this as a test of endurance and I did it!  No, the ending was no better than the beginning or middle.  Sorry, Barbara Michaels, I usually can find something positive to say about a book, but not this one.	2002-07-14

I know I do, but after reading this book I don't think I ever will again.  Jean loses her sight at the age of 12 and has so many things to overcome.  Luckily for her, her parents didn't coddle her and made Jean do everything for herself that was possible.  As the years go by she feels something is missing and after meeting Forest Holly, a man who also lost his sight, she knows that she needs to be married to him.  This story takes in all the years from 1930 on through Jean and Forest's married life and all the challenges they face through lean years and the hardships of raising four children with little help.  There were some hilarious parts, and some sad too.... This is truly a book that will make a person thankful for their sight and let you know that whatever adversities you may have to face, they can be overcome.  A book I will recommend to everyone.	2002-05-24

I finished &quot;The Cape Ann&quot; by Faith Sullivan and had to begin on &quot;The Empress Of One&quot; right away.  I loved both books.  This one picks up where The Cape Ann left off, except it focuses more on Sally Wheeler, Lark's best friend.  Sally has had a hard childhood, dealing with her mother who is suffering from depression, but at this time nobody understood the disease and thought she was crazy.  Lark has moved away to California, so Sally's main friend now is Beverly, who has also had a tough time, but is able to make the best of it.  Sally's grandparents on both sides come to stay occasionally and help out, but for the most part she is home alone with her dad.  Sally has a knack for acting and loves reading, which helps carry her through alot of turmoil... Sullivan has totally captured the essence of a young girl growing up, learning about boys, puberty, and sex, all without the help of a mother.  Sally has gotten involved with a boy that is using her, but feels almost addicted to him.  On top of that, her favorite teacher is run out of town after someone tells the school that he is gay.  The teacher soon turns up dead and Sally blames herself, all of this combines to make Sally start to act like her mother.  Will she go crazy too?  I enjoyed this book so much that I will be looking for other novels by Sullivan, and will recommend these two books to others.	2001-12-31

I checked this book out at the library without ever having heard of it or the author, but was I ever impressed!  The story is told from the perspective of young Lark, who is about 6 when the story begins.  She is the only child of a strong willed mother and often abusive father, living in Minnesota during the depression.  Lark's mother is making do, living in the train depot where her husband works, saving every penny she can so that one day they can build their own house.  Lark and her mother have decided on a Cape Ann style house, but everytime they get enough to make a down payment on it, her father ends up gambling away every bit of it.  He is a devout Catholic and Lark is trying so hard to study to be confirmed, but no matter how hard she tries, he finds fault with her.  It's Lark's mother who keeps her going.  She is a woman ahead of her time, figuring out a way to make money on her own, she learns to type and starts her own business.  They befriend a man named Hilly who is a hero from the war, but has come home with a shattered mind.  He has the personality of a young child and Lark loves to go to his house and read to him.  She and her mother always remember Hilly on his birthday and Christmas, much to the disgust of the father.  This story is so great, because the author has really gotten into the mind of a child.  I laughed out loud at some of the true things that Lark thought, and felt angry and sad right along with her when her father beat her.  This was such a good book that I am ready to start on the next one by the same author.  I would recommend it to any age reader.	2001-12-25

Instead it's the kind of book that is slow paced and one you don't want to have end.  Maeve Binchy has once again written a book that takes the reader to Ireland and introduces you to a town called Shancarrig, and the huge copper beech tree which watches over the town's school.  Each character is explored, many from the time they were born, until they reach adulthood.  The children at the school are often poor, such as Maura, who has grown up with an alcoholic father, but manages to make a good life for herself and her son, Michael, who is born with Down's Syndrome.  And Maddie Ross, the school teacher, who has a secret love with the town's young priest.  I listened to this on Recorded Books audio and the narrator had a beautiful Irish accent which just enhanced the story.  I enjoyed every minute of it, as I have all of Maeve Binchy's other stories.  A must for anyone.	2001-11-12

I received this book for Christmas last year and honestly tried to read it.  I found the beginning interesting, how people mysteriously vanished, leaving nothing behind but their clothes.  As the book progressed, however, I got really bored reading through the political side of it, dealing with Carpathia and the one world jargon.  I never did finish the book, so when I found it unabridged on audio at my library I decided to give it another chance.  I did manage to get through the whole thing this time and found that I wanted to move on to the next in the series.  I realize this is someone else's interpretation of Revelations, but it was interesting to imagine what would happen if all of these prophecies came true.  I would recommend this book to anyone as long as they don't mind having to wait for additional volumes to be written.	2001-11-11

If Stephen King had written this, I probably wouldn't have been able to sleep, but this wasn't the case.  Rayford and Buck, our main characters, are now employed by Carpathia, and have managed to hide the fact that they are part of the Tribulation Force, formed to fight Carpathia.  If he is the real anti-christ, can't he figure this out?  God knows everything about everyone, wouldn't the anti-christ be able to figure out that these two are out to get him?  Oh well, it is just fiction and I have to admit I am anxious to get on to the third in the series.  I liked the romance in this book, but felt it could have been more suspenseful.	2001-11-11

I listened to this book on audio and maybe that made it harder to follow than actually reading it, but I was kind of left behind several times.  The story takes place mainly in a radio station in 1942, where our main character, Jack Dulaney, is trying to help his love interest, Holly O'Hara/Carnahan, discover what has happened to her father.  I guess the main plot was clear, but when the story veered off into Nazis and Irish thugs and the like, I couldn't stay with it.  To tell the truth, I didn't really care that much who had killed her father, as he was never a character that was developed enough to make me care.  Along with his death are those of Jack's friend, Marty, and another radio employee's husband.  Too many people were brought into the story without explanation which made for a pretty blah mystery.  I stuck it out until the end, not so much because I cared about the ending, but just to see if I could do it.  I suppose this would have more meaning to someone who lived in this time period and could remember the days when radio was the main form of entertainment, but it didn't appeal much to me.	2001-10-17

The story centers around Bigger Thomas, a 20 year old black man who hasn't done much with his life up to this point.  He lives in a one room apartment with his mother, sister and brother without many prospects for the future.  He has already spent some time in reform and has been hanging out with the wrong crowd.  Finally, a chance comes along that could turn things around for Bigger.  He is given the job of driving for a wealthy white family and I was hoping it would work out for Bigger, but the first night on the job things go terribly wrong.  Mary Dalton, the daughter of the wealthy white man, has Bigger drive her supposedly to the university in the evening, but instead goes to meet up with her boyfriend, Jan, who is in the communist party.  Jan and Mary try to befriend Bigger, but he is confused by this and hates Mary.  By the time the night is over, Mary and Jan are drunk and Bigger has to figure out a way to get Mary up to her bedroom without her parents finding out.  As things turn out, Bigger ends up murdering Mary, albeit accidently, and to cover up his crime he carries her body down into the basement and chops her head off, then sticks her into the furnace where he hopes she will burn completely leaving no trace of the crime.  I actually found myself on Bigger's side, hoping he wouldn't get caught, because it all had been an accident, but of course things get out of control from here.  The author has woven a suspensful story, capturing the feel of how it would be to be a black person in 1940 when they weren't welcome in most places, and were hated by white people.  As Bigger goes to trial he is defended by a white man who comes to understand why Bigger felt the way he did and helps Bigger come to terms with his execution.  This book is an eye-opener for people who can't understand how hard is was(and maybe still is) to be black in America.	2001-09-01

This is the first novel by Penelope Stokes that I have read, but certainly it won't be the last! This book had everything, romance, adventure, history, and all without any bad language or explicit sex. The story revolves around 93 year old Amethyst, who is about to be evicted from her lifelong home by her own son. After taking her great granddaughter (also named Amethyst) hostage, Amethyst begins to tell her the history of the house and her ancestors, beginning with Silas Noble who came to Mississippi to be a doctor for the plantations in the area. He married Pearl, another who shared his beliefs that everyone, slaves and the wealthy deserve the same medical care. Throughout their married lives, Pearl and Silas are great friends with the black slaves and even help many of them escape to the north.  After Silas passes on, he leaves the land to his best friend and former slave, Booker's son Enoch instead of his own son Abe, who is the complete opposite of his parents.  The story continues with the next generations, Abe's daughter and Enoch's and how they continued the fight to make black people free and accepted.  The book is always interesting and one of those stories you wish wouldn't end. I am looking forward to reading all the other novels by Penelope Stokes and would recommend this to any age group.	2001-08-24

This was pretty good too, other than the fact that I felt she began to drone on towards the end, and I was getting bored.  The story, though, is good.  It begins with the morning that Vera Hillyard is hanged for murder, we don't know who's or what happened.  From there we start back years before as Vera's niece tries to remember what led up to the murder so an author can write a book about it.  Vera is a strange woman who adores her younger sister Eden and basically raises her after their parents die.  The niece comes to visit occasionally to escape the war and finds Vera to be rather hard to get along with.  Vera is married and has a son, but her husband is always away in the war and her son, Frances, despises Vera for sending him away to boarding school as a youngster and does his best to make her life miserable.  Throughout all of this, though, Vera still longs for another child which she eventually has, named Jamie.  It is kind of a mystery too, who the father of this boy is, which adds to the suspense.  The author hints at the fact that 2 children died mysteriously while Vera is near, though never comes out and says she was involved, so among all these people it isn't clear who she murdered until the story is over half finished.  Barbara Vine has written a unique story, unlike any other I have read, kind of a backwards mystery where the reader knows the criminal and the crime but not who was killed or why.  Like I said before, it did tend to drag on longer than necessary, but for anyone who likes a little different spin on a mystery, suspense type novel, this is for you.	2001-08-14

Then hard times hit her own relatives as her Uncle Jim is fired from his job after trying to line up a union.

The story captures all the hardships people of this time had to endure, but also the kindness of people like Virginia and her family.  They are put to the test when word gets out that the sheriff is planning to burn the residents of Sioux City out of there town.  Virginia is caught between wanting to help her new friends or protecting her father, who she knows will want to go out and help.

The story centers around Dr. Jessie Copeland, a neurosurgeon who has helped develop a robot that can assist in brain surgeries.  She is sought out by a villanous killer, Claude Malloche, who discovers he has a brain tumor and needs the best surgeon possible to operate on him.  Malloche has been pursued for 5 years by a CIA agent named Alex, who would like nothing more than to see him dead.  Posing as a security guard at the Boston hospital, Alex is on to Malloche's plan for surgery.  The story becomes very exciting as the hospital is sealed off by Malloche's followers who have the go ahead to release a deadly gas if his surgery is not succesful.  With all of this on Jessie's mind she has to perform delicate brain surgery using the robot ARTIE, which isn't quite ready to be used on living patients.  Of course there is some romance tied in as Jessie is attracted to Alex, and added to the suspense it makes for a real good read.  I will be looking for the other books by Michael Palmer soon.	2001-08-04

I can never say a bad word about any of the Mitford books, this one being no exception.  It wasn't as good as the other 5, but I did enjoy it.  We go back in time to the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia and how he proposed to her.  Jan Karon is such a talented writer, and as usual I hated to see the story end.  If I were going to complain it would be that the book was too short.  I was listening to it on Recorded Books Audio and out of the blue the narrator said, &quot;the end&quot;.  I was so surprised as there was still one whole tape left to listen to (which ended up being an interview with Jan Karon).  If you have read the other 5 novels about Mitford then this book is a must, but a reader might not get much out of it if they start with this book.  The characters aren't delved into very deeply.	2001-08-04

First there is Cush Walker who, as a young boy, watches as white men lynch his father.  This is in the 1960's, then we jump back to 1929 and meet Comilla, a 15 year old girl who falls in love with her black piano teacher and finds herself pregnant, and finally to 1977 where 11 year old Nat Hennessey is witness to the violent beating death of his father by a black man.  Now it is the present and all 3 of these stories from the past come together.  Nat Hennessey is a detective for the New York police department, Cush Walker is a brilliant neurosurgeon, and Commilla (the granddaughter of the 1929 Comilla) is engaged to Nat.  The day before their wedding Comilla is shot in the head by the same man who killed Nat's father years ago.  It is up to Cush to save her life with cutting edge technology that he has developed.  Here is where the story takes a turn as Nat finds out that his fiance used to be in love with Cush.  Between trying to catch the killer, J.J.Jackson, and volunteering to be the guinea pig for Cush's brain scan, Nat stays pretty busy.Adding to all this is the issue of racism.  Cush has always had a prejudice against whites and Nat against blacks, now they must come together to save Comilla who they discover is part black.  This story has some great twists and leads the reader in many different directions.  It is a romance, medical thriller, and murder mystery all rolled into one.  My only complaint was that the ending seemed to drag on a bit more than necessary, but all in all it was a really fun read.	2001-07-29

The story takes retired detective now lawyer, Stone Barrington, to Hollywood to help search for his former girlfriend Arrington who has married the famous actor, Vance Calder.  Stone is surprised after he arrives to find that Calder isn't as worried about Arrington as he had first appearred to be.  He is given first class treatment, a fancy car, nice hotel, even a part in Vance's new movie,and is then shuffled out of town in a hurry which only makes Stone determined to find out what is really going on with Arrington, especially since  Calder has told Stone that Arrington is pregnant and there is a chance that Stone could be the father.  The reader is led on a chase with important Hollywood types who want to see him dead.  He narrowly escapes death after being tossed overboard into the Pacific ocean with an anchor tied to his waist.  Stone figures out that Arrington is being held against her will and won't stop until he has found her.  That may mean an end to Vance Calder's career if the public find out about the scandal he's gotten himself into.  It's up to Stone to uncover the truth about who has taken Arrington and why without letting Vance's name come out.  The story has a very exciting ending which I won't reveal and all in all it was a good story.  The only objection I have is that Stone was sure quick to jump into bed with any pretty woman that looked his way.  Isn't he concerned about diseases?  Well, I know it's just a story, but I could have done without all the sex.	2001-07-22

I sat down and read &quot;Open House&quot; in one sitting, I enjoyed Elizabeth Berg's style of writing so much.  The main character, Samantha, is so average...not beautiful, worrying about her weight, feeling dependent on her husband.  Now that he has decided he doesn't love her anymore, and wants a divorce, she is lost, worrying about how she will make the mortgage payments among  other things.  I have never been through a divorce, but I thought Berg did a good job of capturing how it must feel for a woman.  Samantha spends the first part of the book feeling depressed, at one moment deciding to turn into this elegant person, and in the next she can't make herself get dressed.  Several comical characters come into the story such as Veronica, her mother who believes the best thing is for Samantha to start dating again.  When she finally does take her mother up on one of her blind dates, it is a disaster.  Then Samantha's friend Rita flies in for a week and picks her up a bit.  But it is a man named King who seems to be the best remedy for what ails her.  He is an overweight man who works odd jobs, but manages to be just what Samantha needs.  He helps her find a job and the self esteem to move on from her husband.  I thought the book was at times sad, funny, and very true and I will be looking for more by Elizabeth Berg.	2001-07-22

That is until a rumor about youngest sister Liddy's fiance surfaces.  Stella, Heather and Bridie decide she needs to know about the rumor that Liddy's future husband may be a child abuser, and that's where things begin to come undone.  As a social worker, Bridie can't take the chance that he may harm her neice and nephew, and is hurt when Liddy refuses to believe the gossip and won't speak to Bridie anymore, but seems to not blame the other two sisters.  This is the first time that Bridie has not had her sisters around her and it ends up bringing her and her husband Dennis closer than they have ever been.  Bridie is furious with the 3 sisters and vows that she will never speak to them again when she isn't invited to Liddy's wedding.  I got mad right along with her and didn't blame her a bit for trying to dig up a little bit of revenge.  Bridie finds out by accident that Dennis and Liddy had slept together years before and everyone knew it but didn't tell her.  She comes up with some facts that are sure to put some fireworks into the upcoming nuptials!  I was rooting for Bridie all the way, but in the end she gets so vindictive that she drives everyone away from her.  A good story that captures the essence of siblings very well.

This leads to a romantic connection to Gus, the police detective.  George doesn't need his skills though, as she pretty much single-handedly pieces the puzzle together on her own.  George's elderly mother and friend come to spend the Christmas holiday in London and are left on their own as George tries to figure out why anyone would have killed the young Dr. Harry and she ties the two mysteries together.  I wondered throughout the book why the hospital keeps her on the payroll as she never seems to be doing any post mortem work, always running around the hospital seeking leads or off with Gus.  Anyway, she comes up with a baby adoption scheme which someone at the hospital must be running and it's up to her to figure out who before any more dead babies pop up.  I felt like the story dragged on way too long with very little excitement.  I was hoping for more in the autopsy department, but since she was never actually working there wasn't much of that.

The first, and still favorite was &quot;A Sight for Sore Eyes&quot;, but &quot;The Killing Doll comes in a close 2nd.  This book centers around a young woman named Dolly who is quite an introvert due to the huge disfiguring birthmark on her face.  She stays in her house for the most part and does sewing for the neighbors to make money.  After her mother dies, Dolly becomes the mother figure to her younger brother, Pup who, as a teenager, sells his soul to the devil in order to grow taller.  This leads to a fascination with the occult and Dolly is soon his biggest supporter, urging him to conjure up spirits and get rid of the people she feels are ruining her life, such as her new stepmother.  Pup humors her and after performing some rituals, the stepmother does indeed die.  Dolly begins to lose touch with reality and plunges deeper into the occult, while Pup is losing interest in it.  The story shows how disturbed Dolly becomes and how her fate entwines with another disturbed young man.  As usual, Ruth Rendell writes a real page turner with a style all her own.	2001-07-08

I was really getting into the story line about the girls who mysteriously disappeared, then returned in a few days unwilling or unable to tell police what had happened to them. I was sure the pedophile brought into the story was the culprit, but the two things had nothing to do with the other.   I was a bit disappointed when the explanation came out midway through the book and it wasn't anything to get too worked up about.  Then the author went on a completely different track with the abused woman plot.  I guess they did all tie in together as the abused woman's baby had turned up missing too.  I liked the book and will be reading more of Ruth Rendell's work, but I prefer the books that are more suspense and less Inspector Wexford.	2001-07-01

It wasn't exactly exciting, though.  Inspector Wexford is caught in the middle of a kidnapping when his wife is one of the hostages.  I was looking forward to an exciting search but was surprised when shortly into the book, his wife was released by her captors.  This  group was supposedly against the new bypass being built through the town, objecting to destroying trees and killing wildlife, so that's the direction Inspector Wexford takes as he tries to find the remaining 4 hostages.  I'm not great at solving mysteries but even I had figured out part of the plot before the end.  Rendell does tend to drag things out, making the story longer than she has to, but I can't help but like her style of writing so much that it doesn't bother me.  I have read one other Inspector Wexford novel and liked it too, but have to say her suspense type novels grab my attention better.  By the way, if you have a chance to listen to any of her books on Recorded Books audio, the narrator, Divina Porter, is great. She has that cool English accent and I could listen to her all day.	2001-07-01

It is only the second in the Prey series that I have read, but after reading Certain Prey, it is a disappointment.  I listened to it on audiobook and had a terrible time trying to keep up with the characters.  I wasn't able to go back and look up the names again, so struggled a bit that way.  Sandford didn't really take the time to develop the characters, which made it hard to feel much empathy towards them.  Plus the fact that all he could seem to think about was which woman would he sleep with.  He had the friend ( a fellow policewoman who was shot), the model (who he did sleep with), the Dr. (who he thought he might marry if she asked him) and his old girlfriend from his college days.  I, like other reviewers, just really didn't care much about the people in the story and the action just didn't interest me.  It sounds like the previous Prey books are more worth my time and I'll have to go back and try them.	2001-07-01

I love horror, thriller, suspense novels and this selection by Dean Koontz has a little of each.  This is about the sixth book of Koontz's that I've read and am beginning to see a theme.  As in most of his other works, there is a dog, a bad guy who has a fixation on eyeballs and junk food, and the list could go on.  False Memory was quite a fun read as I knew of course, that the main characters (and their dog) would turn out just fine.  The story centers around a couple, Martie and Dusty, who find themselves brainwashed by a psycho psychologist that Martie met while taking her agorophobic friend Susan to her therapy sessions.  After Martie finds herself having panic attacks in which she wants to harm her husband Dusty, using keys to gouge out his eyes among other ghoulish tortures, she starts seeing Dr. Mark Ahriman herself. Dusty also feels something isn't quite right when it seems like blocks of time are missing. Shortly after this Dusty begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together in record time, and figures out Dr. Ahriman's evil plot.  Time is running out for them to get Dusty's brother Skeet to safety and save themselves, but thankfully the characters in the story are a lot smarter than I would have been.  I liked the character of Dr. Ahriman, he reminded me of Sideshow Bob on the Simpson's.  Very pompous, and a bit childish, but brilliant.  His methods of brainwashing were impressive, if only he had put them to good use.  I enjoyed the story, Koontz manages to throw a little humor in along with the suspense.	2001-05-28

I have noticed this audiobook at the library for a long time and finally checked it out as my choices are dwindling.  Was I ever glad I did!  This turned out to be such a great suspense, thriller, mystery, and even a bit of romance all in one.  Narrator George Guidell, from Recorded Books, once again has outdone himself in portraying all the characters.  The author starts the story out making the reader believe a sadistic murderer has been set free because of a technicality, and the detective now on the case isn't doing much to solve it. To make matters worse, women are being raped and even killed, all with similar circumstances.  That's when deputy Annie Broussard and detective Nick Fourcade decide to secretly do some investigating on their own.  She is being ostracized by her fellow police officers for arresting Fourcade after she caught him beating Marcus Renard,the suspected murderer, nearly to death.  The story shifts suspicion from Renard, to a detective, even to Renard's autistic brother.  Marcus develops an obsession with Annie when he believes she saved his life, and though it helps with her investigation, she is also becoming very afraid of him.  The ending has some real surprising twists and keeps the reader guessing all the way.  This is the first book I have read by Tami Hoag, but if this is any indication, I will have to get my hands on the rest.	2001-05-22

This book, the author himself an actual doctor, centers around a medical breakthrough that everyone is hoping will cure heart disease.  Especially hoping for a miracle cure is cardiologist Brian Holbrook whose dad is suffering from devastating heart problems.  After rushing his dad to a Boston hospital, Brian hears about this new drug and hopes to get his dad into the testing group as he refuses surgery.  But alas, like all things that sound too good to be true, so it is with this miracle drug.  Brian manages to get himself on staff at the Boston Heart Institute after proving he is a brilliant doctor, even though he has an addiction to pain killers stemming from a football injury years ago.  After taking this new drug, his dad doesn't improve as Brian had hoped and ends up dying.  Suddenly, things begin to look suspicious and patients that appeared to have been cured by this heart medication are being killed.  The good doctor begins to figure out the whole plot behind the rush to get FDA approval and as a result, finds his life in jeopardy.  Unsure who can be trusted, he is pretty much on his own against some very determined people.  The story is fast paced and quite interesting, especially coming from a doctor's point of view.  The ending has a couple of good twists and I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.  This is the first book I have read by Michael Palmer, but am anxious to get my hands on the rest!	2001-05-12

In this book, Anna is in New York to keep an eye on her sister who is in the hospital, but it seemed like she spent a heck of lot more time running around the city.  Most of the story takes place on Ellis Island where Anna is staying with a fellow ranger.  She takes to exploring the area and happens to be a witness when a young girl falls to her death off the Statue of Liberty.  The police believe she may have been pushed by one of the security guards who, himself, ends up being the next to take the plunge.  Of course, Anna can't rest (I noticed throughout the book she rarely slept) until she solves the mystery.  Clues are hard to come by, but Anna manages to turn things up that the police couldn't.  She ends up piecing things together and nearly gets herself killed in the process.  The story tended to drag on a bit, but all in all it was a pretty good mystery.  I guess I'm getting hooked on Anna Pigeon mysteries and will have to check out the others by Nevada Barr.	2001-05-12

I have read a couple of Siddon's novels before this, and this was definitely my favorite.  The story centers around Peyton, a 12 year old girl being raised by her father after her mother died shortly after giving birth to her.  All her life, Peyton had believed that she had killed her mother and that's why her father wasn't very loving towards her.  I felt so sorry for Peyton when her Aunt Augusta took her to Atlanta to get her hair fixed and new clothes.  She came out of the beauty shop with a huge perm and clothes she hated and went home and cried.  Fortunately, along comes cousin Nora who manages to create a cute hairdo out of the perm and begins to bring Peyton out of her shell.  The people in the town either love Nora or hate her, and her views on racism cause alot of commotion, but I couldn't help but love her character.  Of course, I rooted for Nora and Peyton's dad to fall in love and have a happy ending, but the author throws in a few twists and the story doesn't always go the way I'd hoped, but I enjoyed the whole book and will recommend it to all my friends.  I can't wait until the next Anne Rivers Siddons novel.	2001-04-23

After reading it cover to cover, he is now my favorite player in the NBA.  While it spent a lot of time talking about his religion and Allah, it also went into some interesting pieces of information like how many dixie cups of ice cream he would store in his fridge.  After reading the book, I know what a caring guy Hakeem really is, and that he is a fine team leader.  I definitely got my money's worth.	2001-04-14

It was a cool story idea, having a 20 year old man with supernatural powers try to rid the world of people he didn't feel deserved to be here.  Like a homeless man and a woman and child living out of their car.  When a police officer accidently ticked him off, he and his partner are the next in line.  I thought Dean Koontz did a good job of making the apparitions scary, and the narrative by the dog was great.  I love dogs, and this sounded like I would have imagined the dog to be able to think and talk.  The only drawback was that I think the police officers figured out the whole plot way too fast.  I would have never guessed what was causing the terrifying beasts to appear, or have been able to figure out who was behind it, but that's fiction and it was a fun listen.  I like all of Koontz's novels, this wasn't my favorite, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes a little horror.	2001-04-10

In part one, the sherriff of Flowering Dogwood is trying to solve the murder of a 14 year old girl with Down Syndrome.  He hates to believe his son Billy had any part in it, but he and a group of high school friends were recently caught killing stray cats.  As the evidence begins to point straight at Billy, his father cannot deny his guilt.  Unable to turn in his son, he commits suicide.  The story then jumps to the present day when the sherriff's daughter Rachel is now a detective and decides to reopen the unsolved case.  The plot thickens when a doctor's 29 year old daughter, Clair, disappears and it just so happens that she worked at the Blind school with Rachel's brother Billy.  Several others are suspects too, and the story takes alot of twists and turns as the reader tries to figure out who is behind the eventual murder of Clair, and then the abduction of Clair's younger sister and her boyfriend. It seems inevitable that the two cases are tied together, though almost 20 years apart. Alice Blanchard did a nice job of creating a good mystery with a surprising ending that kept me guessing all the way.  I am looking forward to more of her work.	2001-01-28

I got into this story immediately and found it hard to put down.  The three main characters in the book were all identifiable.  I could see how Kathy felt so helpless as her house is taken away from her through no fault of her own, but at the same time I felt like Behrani should be allowed to keep the house as it also was no fault of his that it was put up for auction.   When Les came on the scene I had a feeling he wasn't going to help matters any which he sure didn't.  I didn't find the ending to be a letdown as some did, it was full of twists I hadn't expected, but I was wishing for a happier ending.  I will be looking for more work by this author.	2001-01-02

Drowning Ruth was no exception.  I loved the way the author switched back and forth between Ruth and her Aunt Mandy telling the story.  The setting is 1919 and Amanda finds herself falling apart after nursing wounded soldiers and then finding out that the man she loves is married.  Upon returning home to her sister, Mattie and niece Ruth, Amanda begins to recover and helps Mattie care for Ruth while her husband Carl is in the war.  Unfortunately, Mattie drowns, and there is where the mystery begins.  The author leads the reader to wonder how she drowns; was it an accident or did Amanda have something to do with it?  I enjoyed the book and read it in almost one sitting.  I will be looking forward to other novels by Chrisina Schwarz.	2000-12-15

Maybe I'm just not a lover of crime suspense type novels, but I really had to push myself to finish this book.  I listened to it on audiobook and half-way through the story a tape broke.  I almost gave up on it then, but did finish the story.  I definitely didn't like the graphic description of the dolphins being mutilated to get their endorphins, but did like the author's quirky characters, especially Pepper.  She was a red neck assistant to Dr. Bean Wilson,who was hoping to find a cure for phantom limb pain.  He himself had lost his legs in Vietnam and was experiencing excruciating pain in his missing legs.  After finding out that dolphins were somehow able to take pain away, he begins experimenting on disabled veterans, who are going through the same pain. Unfortunately, to do the experiments, the doctor needs the spinal columns and brains of dolphins.  The patients aren't living through the treatments though, and Thorn, Key West's local private eye, gets into the middle of it all.  He is involved in a scuffle which leaves him paralyzed and in the care of Dr. Bean, his childhood friend who would like nothing better than to try out his antidote on Thorn.  There is a little suspense, but actually I thought that the Dr. was onto a good idea.  If he had a better method for obtaining the endorphins I think it would have merit.	2000-12-03

I wish there was a sequel; Kent Haruf writes dialogue that is so real and typical of the area.  I am from a small farming community and the two older brothers were so comical, they reminded me of lots of people I know.  The story centers around Victoria, a teenage girl who finds herself pregnant and kicked out of her mother's house.  With nowhere else to go she ends up depending on the kindness of a few people in her community.  The author has really captured the personalities of all the characters.  The only thing that disappointed me was that the story had to end.  I am looking forward to reading anything else by Kent Haruf and will definitely recommend this book to anyone.	2000-11-15

I have read most of those on her list, some I liked, some I didn't, but this story was one of my favorites.  The author writes a tale of a girl who is brought up with a very religious, often fanatical, family.  Her grandfather is the founder of the Fire and Brimstone church and nobody goes against his rules without paying dearly for it.  The children in the church work long hard days in the tobacco fields and during the school year attend school with others who are not in their church.  Ninah, the main character, is a young girl who is beginning to question the strict rules and punishments.  Her main ally is her grandmother, Nanna, who is often brought up as an example of a terrible sinner in her grandfather's sermons.  When Ninah and James become attracted to each other, it is Nanna who suggests they become prayer partners so that they can spend time together.  At first it is only holding hands, but eventually Ninah figures out she is pregnant.  She keeps it to herself for quite awhile, but eventually tells James, who knows he will be punished terribly.  James ends up killing himself and Ninah is left alone with her secret.  Eventually Ninah's pregnancy is out in the open and her first punishment is to be dunked in the river while sitting in a small cage.  Then she is banished to her grandmother's house for the remainder of her pregnancy.  I was so afraid that Grandpa Herman would kill the baby after it's birth, and was relieved that the baby was spared, though Ninah wasn't allowed to raise him.  I really enjoyed the whole story, and knowing that the wild beliefs held by the church aren't all fiction, made it even more interesting.  This was the first book I've read by Sheri Reynolds, but immediately got another, &quot;A Gracious Plenty&quot; and think it is great, too.  I will highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to enjoy a fairly short, entertaining novel.	2000-10-26

The first half was so boring, it mainly dealt with all the different people Hitler was associated with in the early 1920's.  Lots of political jargon, it was really hard to stay with the story.  The only thing that kept me going was that I had read some of the customer reviews and most thought it was quite good.  About halfway through the story started to be a bit more interesting.  Hitlers niece, Geli Raubal, was a young woman who found herself attracted to her Uncle Adolph.  He also, was fond of her and apparently at that time it wasn't totally unheard of for a niece to marry her uncle.  Hitler never went that far, though, he just controlled her life and didn't let her get too close to any other men.  Geli was a bit jealous of another woman Hitler spent time with, and eventually he admitted he was in love with her, but he was very odd and the things he did with her were more like molestation. Geli wants to get away from him, and Hitler knows that to continue seeing Geli will affect his political chances, so he ends up killing her and everyone pretends that it was a suicide. I know the author has fictionalized this, but I am curious as to how much is actual fact.  I found the most interesting part of the whole book to be at the end where the author tells about how everyone's lives ended up...Geli's family and Hitler's friends.  Most ended up killing themselves, it sounded like.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for an entertaining, fast paced book.  It would appeal to history buffs, though.	2000-10-11

Nora Roberts managed to write a fantastic romance, which, by itself was great, but then wove in a murder mystery and came up with a real winner.  The story takes place in a small town in Mississippi called Innocence.  A serial murderer is killing women and they are all connected to the Longstreet family, especially Tucker. He is a laid back, kind of lazy, womanizer who had dated the first 3 women killed.  The new girl in town, Caroline, has moved into her grandmother's house to recuperate from her hectic life as a concert violinist.  Of course she is right in the thick of things from the time she arrives.  The mystery is well written and had me guessing from one person to the next.  It is such a good story and Nora Roberts has added lots of humor, and has a good talent for writing southern dialogue.  I am anxious to find other books written by her as this was my first.  I listened to it on Audio-book and was so impressed with the narrator, he sure had alot of characters to portray and did a fantastic job with all of them.  If you happen to get the Recorded Books version on audio there is also a whole tape interviewing Nora Roberts that was fun to listen to.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes either romance, mystery or a good combination of both.	2000-10-06

I'll admit, like some of the other reviewers, I thought the story got off to a slow start.  There were alot of characters to keep track of and the author seemed to jump from one line of thought into a completely different plot line.  I listened to the book on audio and had to really pay attention as it was a little hard to follow at times.  But I'm glad I stuck with it, because all the characters did eventually tie together and I found myself loving this story.  I liked the way Valuable got along with the black people in her community, and especially liked Joody Twoson (I hope I'm spelling it correctly as I didn't see it in print.) She was able to &quot;read&quot; people and I thought it added a lot of interest to the story.  I would recommend that those who gave up at page 100, go back and try it again.  It turned out to be one of the best books Oprah has picked in my opinion and I've read most of them.	2000-09-30

I was leary of taking the time to read (actually listen to) this book as I wasn't nuts about &quot;A Map of the World&quot;.  I sure wasn't disappointed this time.  Alot of people feel it was too depressing and there were alot of miserable times for Ruth and her family, but Hamilton used some humor in the story too.  I laughed over several things, such as the time Ruth tried to make supper and instead of peeling onions, accidently grabbed tulip bulbs.  Sounds like something I'd have done.  Also, when Randolph, the fat neighbor boy, supposedly had a girlfriend.  Ruth is amazed and asks his sister &quot;who?&quot;, to which she simply replies &quot;BAAAA&quot;.   The story is a good example of what can happen to a child if they are constantly put down and told they are worthless and stupid.  If Ruth had had a better mother, I think things would have turned out alot differently for her.  When she finally met Mr. Right, Ruby, I thought he would turn out to be abusive, but he was just like Ruth.  Not real smart and just needing to hear someone say something positive to him once in a while.  I did get a bit fed up with the way Ruth allowed him to be so lazy and didn't really blame her mother for getting mad at Ruby.  I would have kicked them both out a long time before it came down to the final blow-up.  My only complaint about the story was the ending.  It seemed like Jane Hamilton kind of ran out of steam and just wanted to get the book finished.  The interesting storyline seemed to fall apart and did get really depressing towards the end.  I hoped to see Ruth finally having some good luck after she moved in with her aunt and cheer up, but the story ended before we got to find out if she did or not.  &quot;The book of Ruth&quot; turned out to be one of my favorite Oprah picks.  I'll look forward to Hamilton's next novel.	2000-09-25

It was a bit of a letdown as I wasn't able to connect to the  characters in &quot;Night Crew&quot; like I could in his other book.  For  one thing, Jake, the once-policeman now turned lawyer, just lost his son to  suicide.  He even watched it several times on tape and never really seemed  to get too upset about it.  He referred to the incident as &quot;my  kid&quot; died.  Well, as a woman, maybe my perspective is different, but  wouldn't a dad still be a bit more upset than that?  And to jump into bed  with someone he had just met up with a couple of days later...also I agreed  with other reviewers who thought Sandford left alot of loose ends.  Like  when Jake and Anna watched the suicide tape looking for clues, a piece of  paper fell to the ground.  What was it?  Did I miss something?  I was  listening to it on audiotape and may have skipped something there, but  couldn't see where it tied in.  I usually hate to hear a good story come to  an end, but with this one I was tempted to do some fast forwarding.  I  believe I will go back and check out some more of the Prey series, they  seem to be John Sandford's best work.	2000-09-14

This is the first John Sandford book I have read, actually listened to on  audiobook, and was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it and will look  for the other books in the prey series.  I'm not usually a fan of the  &quot;murder, mystery, cop&quot; genre, but this was very entertaining.   The two women in the story, one a professional hitwoman and the other a  lawyer, meet as the result of the lawyer wanting the wife of her  &quot;boyfriend&quot; out of the way.  Things don't go quite as planned,  and the two end up killing anyone that threatens to expose them.  Along the  way they get to be good friends, and neither seems to have any qualms about  killing people.  The lawyer, Carmel, even finds it satisfying and commits a  few murders of her own. (The knee-drilling scenes were very  graphic...ouch!!!!)  Surprisingly, the reader starts to root for them, at  least I did.  The police detective manages to right on their tails which  makes for a great, fast paced story.	2000-09-09

I love anything read by George Guidell and this was no  exception.  The setting is St. Paul, MN during a raging blizzard, which,  being from South Dakota, I can relate to.  The Beanblossom's baby has been  abducted in a copycat kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby years ago.  I found  the story really interesting as I had never bothered to find out much about  the Lindbergh case, but will now go out and get one of the books mentioned  in the story.  I too, figured out who the kidnapper was, but found the  story alot of fun.  The accomplice was a surprise, though.  This was a  suspense-filled plot, with Richard Beanblossom, a reporter, racing against  time to find his 14 month old son before he is killed.  His wife, an  anchorwoman for the news, doesn't have a big part in the story, except for  a section where she risks her life on a bridge to save a baby that a crazy  woman is threatening to throw off the bridge.  She ends up tossing the baby  to rescuers below, then falling 200 feet into the river and only sustains  minor injuries.  In fact, the next day she is up chasing after the  kidnappers.  OK, I know it's only a story.  My favorite part of all was the  look back at Grover Mudd and how he investigated Esther Snow.  It was a  good, entertaining novel, and I'm anxious to read some of Steve Thayer's  other novels.	2000-08-22

I listened to this story on audiocassette and was surprised when I found out it was aimed at 9-12 year olds.  I am almost 40 and enjoyed it.  The  story is about 13 year old Michael Chapman who disappears without a trace  and leaves his family wondering whether he is dead or alive.  The story is  seen mainly through the eyes of his older sister, Jody, who is at first  sad, and depressed.  Then as the months go by without hearing anything  about her brother, she decides to get on with her life, and it seems to be  going well for awhile, but reality catches up with her and she realizes  that things are never going to be the same.  Her mother takes it hardest of  all and with nowhere else to throw her anger and frustration, takes it out  on her youngest daughter.  The story had a realistic view of how this would  probably have felt for the different members of the family.  I hoped too,  that Michael would suddenly show up in the end, or that they would at least  find his body and be able to put things to rest, but that isn't the way the  author chose to end the story.  We are left without an easy ending and I  think a sequel would be a good idea.  I recommend this book to any age  group, young or old.	2000-08-12

I chose to listen to this on audio, not because I thought it looked like a good book, but because there wasn't alot to pick from.  I'm glad I did, though, as I loved the story.  We hear all the time about the dirty 30's  and all the hard times (like walking 3 miles to school uphill in a raging  blizzard) but this really makes a person appreciate what these people must  have gone through.  The story tended to move slowly, but that let the  reader get to know the Joad family well, especially young Tom Joad.  They  managed to make do with very little in the way of money or food and yet  wouldn't hesitate to share what they had with someone else.  It makes a  person feel kind of ashamed to think we look into a full refrigerator and  still think there's nothing to eat.  I was hoping the story would end with  a happy Joad family finding a home and work, but that was left up to the  reader's imagination.  I don't know if John Steinbeck just got tired of  writing or what, but the ending left a little to be desired.  I was sure  they would meet up with their son again, but that probably wasn't a  realistic look at how it most likely was then.  The book will definitely  make me think differently about migrant workers that come into our area.  Things may not be quite as bad now as back then, but they probably face  many of the same circumstances.	2000-08-01

Usually romances aren't my favorite, but I thought I'd give it a try.  It wasn't the kind of book I have been reading lately, namely those recommended by  Oprah, but that's a nice break once in a while.  This time- travel aspect  is fun to imagine, though as several others have said, it isn't very  plausible. I never really got into the romance between Tarik and Kady...I  kept hoping that she would decide to go back to Cole's time and stay.  The  part about the wedding dress being put into the flour container was never  really explained either.  How did it get there?  And how did the flour  container end up in Alexandria, VA?  Oh well, like I said, this isn't meant  to be a real deep thinking novel, just fun reading, which it is.  This is  the first Jude Devereaux novel I've read, but may have to try another.	2000-07-09

Faith was an awesome female character.  She was strong and stood firm throughout the whole story.  Despite its typing and grammar errors, this book kicked some major bum.  I highly reccomend it to  anyone who believes in fairy tales and doesn't get critical when they are  reading.  It was very well-writen.  Good bye!	2000-05-27

Sometimes a book featuring teenage characters comes across with false sounding conversation, but Steve Gannon did a great job of telling the story with  believeable dialogue.  The character of the father, Dan Kane, was at times  likeable and at other times I wanted to kill him.  He was trying to make  sure his children grew up tough and could never bring himself to say  anything positive to any of them, especially Travis, who happened to be a  wonderful pianist which really rubbed his dad the wrong way.  The author  led the plot into a lot of different story lines, but made each of them  easy to follow.  I can't say enough about the narrator.  He did such a good  job of bringing each person to life, mainly Dan Kane's voice, that it made  the story even better.  I was sorry to come to the end of this book, but am  hoping to see something new by this author soon.  I would recommend it for  anyone, even though there is some rough language.	2000-05-20

I picked this book partly because of the fact that Jo was a veterinarian and I thought it might have more to do with animals, but practically none of the story took place at her clinic.  I didn't find the plot very  interesting, and got really bored with it, but was determined to finish  listening to it (on audiobook) as it was fairly short.  Jo's husband was a  preacher, but she sure didn't play the part of a preacher's wife.  On  Christmas morning he got up, went to church alone, while his wife and 3  daughters slept in and made dinner.  Not realistic, at least not like the  pastors I know.  Then she very nonchalantly decides to have an affair with  an old roommate from 30 years ago, with hardly a trace of guilt. She didn't  go through with it, but surely would have if Eli hadn't admitted murdering  her friend from years ago.  I just didn't like the character of Jo, and I  guess that's why I couldn't get too interested in the book.  Maybe it would  mean more to someone who had lived in that time period, I'm a bit younger.	2000-05-17

I thought it sounded interesting, especially the part of Simon being autistic, but able to solve these encrypted messages.  I listened to the story on audiobook which may have made it harder to keep track of the characters, but there were so many  introduced that it took me awhile before I could remember who was who.  It  was an OK read, but I'm not really a big fan of thriller/mystery type  books.  I was able to follow the plot, but not without really paying  attention to the story, which was hard while driving.	2000-05-10

I listened to &quot;Tara Road&quot; on audiobook and the narrator really made the characters come alive with her Irish accent, though sometimes I had to strain to understand what she had said. It did take a while to get into the story, but after the first two tapes, I was hooked. The characters of Ria and Marilyn were recognizable, as I am about the same age as they were. I did wish, though, that in the end, Ria would find out about Rosemary having an affair with Danny all those years, and that Annie would have confessed at having witnessed them in the act. I also wanted Ria to tell Danny to get lost after all the troubles he had caused and was glad that she didn't get back together with him when Bernadette lost the baby. The beginning of the story was a bit drawn out, but never having been to Ireland, I thought it was interesting and probably necessary to set the scene of how Ria completely lived for Danny and her children. I have read other Maeve Binchy books and have enjoyed all of them.	2000-04-21

These stories are so good, I don't know if I can wait for #6!  The stories are entertaining, compassionate, and can make you laugh out loud, and then cry.  The reader feels like they personally know  the townspeople of Mitford by the fourth book and genuinely cares about  what happens to them.  Jan Karon has alot of talent and I hope the series  continues for a long, long, time.  If Mitford were a real town, it's  population would soon be expanding, as most readers would love to live  there.	2000-04-02

This is my third Dean Koontz novel in the last 3 weeks, and it was a nail biter...not quite as much so as &quot;Intensity&quot;, but still kept me wanting to finish it, as I knew Joe would come out alright...just didn't  know how.  Dean Koontz really has conspiracy as a theme in the 3 I've read,  actually listened to on audio cassette, and makes for a very thrilling  story.  The story may sound a little far fetched, but with cloning becoming  more common, who knows?  It's a scary thought, but that makes for good  story-telling.  David Birney does a great job as narrator, too.	2000-03-25

I started out reading this book with high expectations.  Ichose it mostly because of it being on Oprah's list, but was prettydisappointed in it.  For one thing, if my 3 year old had been abducted I think I would have gone berserk, not sat at the bar downing drinks. It didn't seem that she was all that concerned about her son being missing.  Besides that, it was a pretty blah storyline.  Kind of a disappointment like Oprah's other selection I read, &quot;Map of the World&quot;.  END	2000-03-15

I listened to the first audiobook, &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; and just about stopped after the second tape because it moved along so slowly, but stuck with it and was certainly glad as I ended up loving the story and  couldn't wait to get back to the library for part two.  That turned out to  be just as good and I would recommend the whole series for anyone who gets  tired of depressing novels with bad language.  Very uplifting and a nice  change of pace.  I listened to the unabridged versions and couldn't have  picked a better narrator.	2000-03-02
