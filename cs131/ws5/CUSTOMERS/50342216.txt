You know, ever since I got my copy of \\"TOLEDO WINDOW BOX\\" in 1974, I have been a fan of this guy. Hey, I love Jesus, and I believe he knows a good joke, and loves it! This book ain't about that. It's about Carlin and his \\"Stuff\\". I feel like a long march survivor sometimes when I sit and think about how things have been herded (no misspell,I don't mean \\"headed\\")for the last forty years. I know I can count on George to make it all sound so silly that I can belly laugh at the unbelievable hubris of culture in chaos. I saw a Carlin show about twenty-five years ago. I would have given this presentation a five If the special effects came with it. Thats part of the show my friends. Lucky for Mr. Carlin he has a literate fan-base so we can also appreciate the written word. I liked this book. I'll pay it the highest compliment a comic can get. It made me laugh;it made me think.	2004-11-25

As a self professed Independent in ideology and vote, I have to admit I kind of liked Ann's book from the standpoint of a weathervane pointing to the right. This writer ain't got any doubt about it. \\"It\\" being anything that ain't RIGHT ain't right. This is southern talk for ya'll that don't know it. This book is a compilation and reinteration of Coulters' writings over the past few years condemning liberalism and the Democratic party as the new \\"Evil Empire\\", (my words). I saw a humorous ad for an cell phone company the other day about a skunk being \\"part of the package\\" in a car buyers deal. \\"Can't unbundle the package\\" was the retort to the dismayed buyers query as to why there was a stinker in the automobile. Everybody has the stinker or the spoiler in America. It grates us to the core that somebody won't see things our way. Look at Michael Moore's F911 or-even better- here, just two days away from the election of 2004, The advertising barrage on both sides of the issues. Coulters' book spends a lot of time on the Clinton years and Ted Kennedy. I suppose there was not a lot on John Kerry to admit him to those hallowed halls of disgust. Ann Coulter does a lot of explaning, albeit skewed and caustic; which sets her apart from a Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity who just yap and fawn over their conservatism at the expense of hard journalism. Anybody can pay lip service and be a lap-dog to a cause. Ann Coulter, man , holy cow, don't go there unarmed... Republican, Democrat, Independent, Conservative, Liberal, Believer, Atheist, Human, Alien... You get my point. You Better. Miz Ann is a force to be reckoned with. Ya Hear?	2004-10-31

Gilbert Morris is one of my favorite writers. As a guy, I gotta admit I don't wait out the \\"romances\\", sorry Friend Gilbert. My wife does and that counts. Up front, number two... Gilbert Morris would not, did not and never would play fast and loose with what the Bible states. I feel sorry for nit-picking reviewers who lie in wait for an omission or addition that sets them off into printing entire books of the Word online to back up their piousness. Get a life babe! These books are meant to augment the experiences of these great patriarchs not re-write them! To the point now that I've had my tirade... This is a GREAT book! These people simple came alive and leapt off the pages. The descriptions of the times and the scenes are spellbinding. If you look in the Bible and count out how few chapters are actually devoted to the story of Noah, you will see the remarkable talent of Gilbert Morris. This guy Noah did actually live, slip up, worry his parents, stay out late, had a drink or two and yet walked with God. I kept thinking about all the old Sci-Fi stuff in the fifties and sixties about neighbors ridiculing the \\"nut\\" who constructed a fallout shelter, yet pounded on the door demanding admission when the air-raid warnings sounded. In short, if you wanna knowa Noah... a pun... loosen up- Read this book. Like the commercial about spaghetti sauce \\"you want it, it's in there. Score 5 for Gilbert Morris.	2004-10-27

Man! I thought S. King had written some action into The DARK TOWER before but this baby takes the prize. Right off the line, one of the beams cuts loose from the tower, shaking all of reality like a force 8 quake. I knew from the git-go that this was a different kind of TOWER read. I really liked the expansion of the Manni folk and their role in the world of the doors. I remember Roland recalling Cort speaking of them early in the series. They showed up large in \\"WOLVES OF THE CALLA\\". So, Susannah has just rolled away from our gang on some kind of four wheeler after surviving Darth Vader swordplay and Harry Potter \\"sneetches\\". Gone to the Dixie Pig in 1999. The character of Mia is so paradoxical that I was amazed that Mr. King was able to deftly incorporate her so efficently into the story. But, reader she had been there since the \\"GUNSLINGER\\"... yes?... Remember?... So also from the past rouse Jack Andolini and his ugly (...). So also rose Father Callahan who showed up in \\"WOLVES\\"(by the long way round \\"SALEMS LOT\\")... And so also begat/regat Stephen King. Some of the new guys are good, nay, great guys and some of the other would insult slime by calling them such. Herein my fellow travellers lie great secrets finally washed of the dim that has so long shrouded them. So many have grown impatient in this wait, that they seem to be abandoning the cause in sight of the end. I expected as much when these books started to come fast. Don't pay them any mind loyal ones. I'm sure they are the come-latelys. You and I know how close the end is. We've had years in most cases to patiently re-read all the books and to glean clues from the novels in between. This book is a new type of Tower adventure and so, so close to the last. Don't even think you've got this figured out.	2004-10-27

When Mr. King announced his muse became uncontrolled to the point that he FINISHED his opus in efficent fashion, I shuddered. Why?...was my first thought. Does his susceptiblity to mortality, so violently revealed to him a few years past drive his rush, I wondered. He referred to Chaucers' \\"CANTERBURY TALES\\" more than once, so I figured I had it right. What worse fate for a work of a lifetime than to be mauled by someone else comissioned to \\"finish\\" it. Then I reminded myself of Kings integrity to his work. No way any of this happy crap is right I finally decided. It simply came down to THE TIME HAS COME. So, I read...These characters have never been a happy band despite Eddie and Susannah. Things have always beset them unexpectedly like as not to go horribly wrong at some point. This novel reminded me of nothing so much as The Clint Eastwood film \\"HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER\\". Everybody and the damn dog knows the bad guys are coming, and everyone of them is guilty of something no matter how trivial it seems. If you dont't see it, read the book until you do. Remember sins of omission are sometimes as despicable as sins of comission. The departure of similarity really does exonerate Roland's Ka-Tet of destructive premeditation. Unlike the Eastwood character, He(Roland) has no ill will towards Calla Bryn Sturgis. But as usual, this place is simply in the path of the Beam. This time there is time to prepare for an invasion of Child-stealing \\"Wolves\\" from Thunderclap. A recurring bane on the poor folken of the Calla.Mr King has fleshed out a bunch of interesting people in this book. He took a lot of care to make his readers get the lay of the land in this one. Some say he could have done as much with less, but to get the feel of the where and the when, I disagree. I was amazed how much Rolands character was expanded. What a guy, what an enigma (as if we didn't already know this). There is a lot in this work. Traitors; smug, easily hated machines, and re-introductions to long gone (but not forgotten) names from the past... not from the TOWER books! In the last pages get ready to have the stage set for unexpected weirdness. I mean it, readers. I really doubt that Stephen King wrote the first words of this story so many decades ago with any of this in mind. Things are not going to be the same with our travellers. EVER. One last thing... I see why it has taken so long. Some people look at a book as pages glued inside a binding,and some, most sadly are. But take a copy of any of these books in the DARK TOWER series and listen to it like a seashell. Up aginst your ear, now... and be still... hear that? If you don't, just put the paper and glue down and be well... But I know you hear it; IF! You! Understand!	2004-10-25

When last we visited the Trib-Force, I said, &quot;Head for the hills!&quot; , but these guys don't know the meaning of retreat. That's good for the cause-I'll tell you now I have some trouble getting behind the picture of Carpathia as some kind of buffoon riding a pig and all that-He seems to know that God is in control and cuts some deals; which, by the way he crawfishes on at the first opportunity. We lose some friends by deciept,  letting us know that Carpathias' minions are not the dense dumb bunnies we may stereotype them as. Praises to the team of Jenkins and Lahay for the handling of the Chang character. Wonderful and insightful... inspiring. There  is a lot more in here for the fans of LEFT BEHIND. Like I said, don't be fooled by Carpathias' foolish antics. He is out to Kill- and Kill he will.One of the great nasty characters in modern literature... One that is to come.

Oh, Jimmy, lost brother.This is the most heartbreaking book I have ever read... but it strikes so close to what I feel will be the truth of the Tribulation of Man in the End of days. Even the Gilbert Morris books I an so high on do not get so down to the dirty real-deal  of life under the iron fist of the Anti-Christ as Brian Caldwell's WE ALL FALL DOWN. I hated the book! I could not put it down. I re-read it. I loved it! I hated the book! I loved it...  This is a profane work from start to finish. If you read it you will see beyond the shallow words of popular writers on the subject of being left behind at the Rapture. You will know the gut wrenching fear , the dedication of those few... and still who at the end , insanely, selfishly follow an unrepentant soul into perdition, forever.

Gregory Benford has seen the future the might have been here in THE MARTIAN RACE, while our bureaucratic untanglable regulatory (...) has strangled the spirit of free enterprise in space. The very premise of Beneford's work is a competition between factions, capatalistic classic , to see who can mount a mission to Mars. Money, FREE FLOWING money and resouorces are the key to Beneford's mission. All the wonderful storylines and the characters -(well and truely developed)-enthrall the reader, but there is the nagging \\"what might be\\" if Microsoft, Nike, Coca-Cola and others were allowed to just buy an advertisment on the mission vehicles, the astronauts suits, even a small insert in the active mission screen. I loved this story. You should read and enjoy the content for what it is. Gregory Benford made me think about the hamstrung space program while entertaining royally.

Galen made his important contributions in the short-lived &quot;B5 Excalibur&quot;, but there was no explanation of the eerie in and out cuts of him and his ilk or any real exploration of their seats of power. Thank you Jeanne Cavelos for this first book in a Babylo-trilogy that cuts through shadows and subterfuge to cast character and depth onto a two dimensional group becoming -in retro- an important force in the development of the Shadow war, if only to point to the frailties of uncertain logic plaguing even the seemingly powerful magicians of the age. I was able to visualise the interaction between Elric and Galen because I had seen them on screen. Even though we know the outcome of the Shadow war, This work is like a journalists' eye account of what happened behind the scenes. THE PASSING OF THE TECHNOMAGES(1) is another fleshing out of the New Legend Of Our Times-Babylon 5. Admirable work by Jeanne Cavelos. I look foreward to this series.	2001-03-30

I believe one of the reasons Stephen King novels enjoy such phenomenal success lies in the authors ability to put the reader into the scene wholeheartedly. He has lived such a life as to be a common man with uncommon talents. In HEARTS IN ATLANTIS we move from a tough-times 1950's (and remember those are the supposed 'good old days') to the gritty, over-idealized 1960's and beyond into the confusion of the media event laden decades to follow. King never loses his focus on what the book is about. I loved the first part of the book as a DARK TOWER fan because SK seems to tease us a lot lately with tid-bits and innuendo. Note to other DT fans, see INSOMNIA. His revels in 60's Maine on the University campus are priceless looks into what feels like an autobiographical whimsey. There are some genuinely crazy characters in this work. Mr. King's characters seem never to come to a resolution with their ghosts-of-the-past, but it is important to note that most always they reach a living agreement with them. Thanks for another glimpse of the gunslinger, and the rose petals from the field at End World. HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a multi-faceted work, and every face shines from within. Highly recommended.	2001-01-08

They introduce genetically engineered humans without typical science fiction techno-speak, keeping to an intelligent prose without losing us in DNA babble. The characters are by and large normals, not GEH's; They have adult relationships, not guilt-ridden regrets or sudden ephipinies of spiritual insight. I really like these genuine people type characters, and the Morris clan develops them with purpose. The people in power are weird enough to be completely believable, in light of Modern politics and Media creation madness. The military technology is fascinating and the soldiers hit the mark dead center bullseye. As events develop you will begin to read faster, hungry for every word. The storyline is familiar, but the telling is what makes the thing. I found myself reminded at times of Frank Herbert's weird HELLSTROMS HIVE; and at others, Stephen King's THE STAND. Make no mistake, though, This is part one of a trilogy by Gilbert Morris and Co. I will hold on to my copies of these works and continue to recommend them with confidence to my Christian and Non-Christian friends. Keep them coming, friend Gilbert.	2001-01-08

The semi-introduction of David Sheridan (What was the comment in 'Deconstruction'- &quot; And what about the incident concerning their son?&quot; I can't believe the part he played in this book is the only role he was dreamt up for.) Don't get me wrong, this is a good book to read. I enjoyed it a lot. After the first two there wasn't a hell of a lot to put together. Without those two volumes this was an exercise in re-run-itis.The killing of Our Nemisis the Drakh was a delighful bonus, and I always wondered how the full Londo/G'Kar scene would play out. This work deserves a revered place in B5 history if only for that. Truely the End , My Good Friends.....	2000-11-27
US	50342216	R2F73XK74LPMEJ	0671741039	907356964	Swan Song	Books	4	5	8	N	N	A Nuclear Holocaust , Already!!!	We have the Planet Earth devestated by disease, comets, and now The Bomb. This offering by Robert R. McCammon differs from the 'Supernovels' of Niven/Pournell and King in that this scenario is a man-made (man-preventable) killing field. RRM has presented a story horrifying because it is more to the heart of the darkside of the Human race than Events Beyond Our Control. The scare is not in the happening itself or the aftermath, but in the loss of reason the Powers-That-Be exibit in the opening of SWAN SONG. I like the way RRM presents his storyline and the way he develops his characters. There is as a required villian, some kind of supernatural 'walkin'dude' type, but it is not the focus of the tale. I don't fault the book for miracle scenes, because the act of surviving this horror is a miracle in itself. As I stated, the characters are well developed, with no one persona becoming too overpowering. I like the way the work keeps its level of suspense steady, with no filler-type dialogue leaving the reader to wonder 'what was that?' Read SWAN SONG. Add it to the Apocalypse Collection...You'll be glad you did.	2000-10-26

William Shatner built a great beginning into this work. Imagine Spock, himself a resurrection alumi, seeing Jim's lighted-from-within grave collapse.  That bee-buzz of transporter-effect must have paralyzed even his Vulcan mind as he tried to pull a logical 'what the hell is going on' from the scene. The last we saw of James T. Kirk was as a dead hero with Jean Luc Picard In GENERATIONS. But remember, Kirk's own prediction- &quot;I'll die alone&quot;- was not fulfilled. We cannot imagine such a forecast as this going unheeded by the STAR TREK guardians. The body of this offering is an insightful look into a part of JTK's personal legend as well as an introduction to a driven side of the character only glimpsed before. There is more to come. Any reader of mine knows I leave the details to you but love to cut to the purpose. No different here . Read THE RETURN and following books by Willim Shatner. After all, he IS Kirk.	2000-10-26

Walter M.Miller Jr. offers us a look into the years of a post-apocolypic world run by gangs and highwaymen. The work begins in an almost medevial time, with the clergy protecting the pre- deluge spoils of Rome with a fervor. The day to day machinations of these poor acolytes with their dedications is to look into the past instead of the future. The appearance of the strange &quot;Benjamin&quot; heralds a journey into that future that none knows or would care to see. Walter M. Miller Jr. handles this tale with such aplomb that we are led through hundreds of years of time and changing circumstance with a smooth, unveiled cadence that lulls the reader into a calm look into a history that never was-until the last chapters where we realize that technology has been reborn in its most monsterous form-and that it's all about to happen again. Hence the title for my humble take on a CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ.	2000-10-25

Take a bit of science conjecture (guess at best) and throw a little middle-age barbarism into the mix, then strand a bunch of contemporary grad students into a situation where they have absolutely NO business...; its a Michael Crichton novel! I did like this book based on my old &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; credo, and I liked the technical front to the story of &quot;quantum foam&quot; ( a scientific hypothesis ). There is a lot of action and suspense in this work , worthy of Michael Crichton, and his view of the deadly up-front day to day struggles for survival of the peasants stand as testament to the progress we as a race have made in these hundreds of years - despite what we may be fed daily in the media. A good read. Take some time with it and absorb the sub-plots. I like a good ending, and this has a goodly fair to fairly good one.	2000-10-24

A beautiful negative image of the crucifiction. Cast aside, Nicholae's soul wasted,thrust into Hell so that his &quot;father&quot; may inhabit a body ... a great smoke belching image of a man... a twisted, evil resurrection. This tale brings to mind a scripture: &quot; Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.&quot; Though many see a messiah, they embrace a fallen angel... wonderful book, horrifying scenario.	2000-10-24

Roland bony persona takes on some flesh however in a marathon 500+ page visit to Giliead and beyond. We finally get to see his faithful Alain, and the somewhat bent Cuthbert in the seams of a great, carefully orchestrated introduction to the past of Roland the Gunslinger. There are introductions to bedevilments and romance, enchantments and tragedies , standoffs and desperate manuevers that only Stephen King could pull off and tie up in a Story line that he has chosen to cut up in such weird and far between episodes. I love those ruby slippers for Oy. I'll say I like it, and I want more of it. Did you say three more books, Mr. King ?

To further complicate matters by falling in love with the widow of a casualty of the struggle who happened to be on the opposite side of the fight... well; Could it get any more difficult?

I hate that. I'll let it lay and just say what I would  tell. ADVENTURE...Got It. SUSPENSE...Got It.  CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT...Got  It.SPIRITUAL REALIZATION...Yep. There are adversaries, allies and innocents  in this work. This is a story; in some places we fall in the middle of a  line , in others we are there from inception. Having read the LEFT BEHIND  series of books , this one shot at me from an entirely different angle.  There was no attempt to disprove the conjecture of hard science that the  world is an ancient place , ancient beyond millions of years. Accept this  as you will or not. I do. My brothers and sisters, there is room for  dreamers and farseekers in the Kingdom!!! I find myself a skeptic in some  of the author's opinions of certain well and trusted earthside  organizations, but they are part of an overall excellent work. This is one  of the few and far spread works of fiction that deal with the field of  Archeology without cloying to boring old texts and footnotes.

I should have titled this one &quot;Twilight Zone meets Revelation&quot;.  Similies between TZ and this work are coincidence. The Hand of God is at  work here. The perfect explanation of and about the events occured and  occuring leave a believer in the position to see the flimsy web of deciept  woven by the spin doctors of the apocolypse. Sadly , most of us will fall  for this pablum fed by the spoon full by said decievers. The premise of  LEFT BEHIND is told from the point of view of a few who realize what has  happened; after a while and after a grouping of those who have a purpose in  the will of God in the End-of-Days just happen to meet. Pure Biblical  prophesy here. The Authors have managed to weave a tale of the Modern world  into  this ancient prophesy without flaw. Bravo! I am way ahead in reading  but  behind in reviewing.

This guy has no idea what is about to befall his  simple existance as a hunting guide. First some jerk kills his pet, Raul  wastes this guy in self defense later and is sentenced to death. First view  of the Cruciform... the dead jerk comes back to life to testify against  Raul and pretty much helps to cook his goose. Raul is sitting in the  deathwhip chair ready to go into non-resurrection oblivion  (having opted  out of &quot;salvation&quot; by not accepting the Cruciform or the Church),  then he wakes up from &quot;death&quot; to be taken to our old friend  Martin Selenus. From here it gets better and better. Poor Raul is charged  by Martin to rescue a messiah who is coming thru time in the good old  Tombs-while facing down the entire human armed forces; then destroy the  chokehold of the Church and its technocore puppetmasters, and.. oh yeah,  rescue Old Earth from the Magellanic Clouds. Only Dan Simmons could pull  this off. The old hawking mat appears again to save the day more than once.  The Shrike is a menacing presence again but believe it or not there is a  creature that will cause you to root for the Shrike. The Church unveils a  brutal ship that destroys every crewman each time it travels. There is a  lot in this work. I usually dont get into reviewing a plotline but a lot of  people seem to need to be reassured that this is a continuation of  HYPERION. It is all that and more. Ride the River Tethys, closed off by the  destruction of the portal net by the hegemony over 200 years ago. Raul has  himself a group of wonder-workers here, folks. Plenty of action, unexpected  turns and twists GREAT new characters, and old friends. The clouds of total  war loom over the Ouster swarms... not forgotten here. Everthing fits,  everything works. The ending is a bit cryptic. That is my only complaint  (minor) See you at THE RISE.	2000-08-20

Here in BLUE MARS, we wind up  maintaining old Mars ecology in domes. The world has come to Mars, Mars has  become the world. The never ending pot of politics and greed is as strong  as ever. The sabotage and intrigue among the competing groups of the First  Hundred and Their offspring and followers is unflagging.The difference here  is in the way we see the landscape of this emerging work of man-which in  truth has always been the star of the show. From the great manmade scars of  the cablefall to the emerging grasslands and seas, the freezings and the  floods. These books are about a far away planet that captures our  imagination like no other. There is very little we can do to convince  ouselves that WE will change, but that is not the issue. Its interesting to  see how little we do change; Robinson tells it like it is. The imagery of  the changing of another world at the hands of our species is what we all  want to peek in on.

Here he is not overt or flamboyant about his work, rather, he is...subtle.  The time left to our imagination here, his role in the Psi-Wars - full of  dark atrocities I imagine - only serves to make him a more mysterious  character to us. Bester is more like unto Carlos the Jackal than Adolf  Hitler in this. It is easier to imagine a Jackal involved in a romance than  a Hitler or other appropriate villian. Bester gets into our heads,  charming, erudite, his humor...subtle. But there to save us from being  taken in is our good friend Mr. Michael Garibaldi, thank goodness. His  tracking and capture of Mr. Bester is one of the crowning moments in the  history of just revenge tempered by reason. I really figured that Bester  would be &quot;spaced&quot; for his crimes, but the sentence suited the  crime so much more elegantly.Subtle...ironic.The final few pages will force  a few tears for Stephen Dexter, but Michael Garibaldi can walk into B5  history without looking back. If ever there was a &quot;we're  quits&quot;,oh, man this was it.Great, Great, Great. To answer the critics  who say too much about the Psi-War was ommitted... Hey, there's another  trilogy in that.

Robert R. McCammon's &quot; SWAN SONG &quot; (an antecedent work)   Draws upon &quot;LUCIFERS HAMMER&quot; and the King Work &quot; THE  STAND&quot; heavily. But first there was this. I love McCammon's book, and  King's; but the best , first groundwork was laid in the chapter and verse  of &quot; LUCIFERS HAMMER.&quot; The development of character is  complete...brilliant.. The scenario is developed with an eye towards the  ultimate conclusion. There is not a word wasted nor a picture left  incomplete. As I read works of literature I often wonder who the writer  knew or met and admired (or not) to draw his characters upon. More so here  than most. The Science may not be flawless, there are gaps in rudimentary  cosmology and physics- but fiction, science or otherwise - requires of the  reader a &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;. This is a worthwhile read if  only to see where the &quot;Apocolypse Genre&quot; began. I would much  rather read &quot;LUCIFER'S HAMMER&quot; than watch &quot;THE STAND&quot;  on television...shudder..... I had rather read &quot;LUCIFER'S HAMMER&quot;  than read &quot;THE STAND&quot;.

All that aside  (if you haven't read WILL by Mr. Liddy)this is a fascinating look into the  rhyme and reason of Bester. He seems to be another over-achiving runt until  a fateful trip with the Grins (great characters, by the way) to meet the  Director.. an old shadowy shade of a man from the past, a man who knows  Bester as Stephen Dexter, son of  a teep renegade couple villified in  PsiCorp history. Changes are coming to the Corps, and Bester had just as  well have a target painted on his back if he cannot become the Super-Psi  cop he strives to be. In  typical fashion he manages to be alienated,  humiliated and finally vindicated in the Corps. Remember, this is his life  and ambition. His confrontation with his prime quarry and the ensuing  dialoge near the end of this book is priceless. Don't miss it. Alfred  Bester is too complicated to review in these few words. He is an experience  more than a character. Our man we love to hate does not disappoint here.	2000-08-03

So much of classic literature begins in such a way. Put 1200 years between Geoffrey Chaucers' and Dan Simmons' narrator's , tweak the political  intrigues of the eras, and change the names of the guilty to misdirect the  innocent... Well, there it is. Except it most definitely is NOT. The core  of humanity itself has undergone a root transformation in HYPERION. The  masters of fate are no longer the Priests of Rome, but the  Technocore..(singular, plural, plurosingular?) The Hegemony of Man has sold  itself out for a set of calculations to divine the future. The catch?.. The  sellers have to do all the work to destroy themselves! Oh, they don't know  this even though the final blow is coming without stealth. The Hegemony is  warring with a bunch of radicals called &quot;Ousters&quot; and each blow  is being looked over Olympus-like by the AI Technocore. The Technocore is  itself fragmented into groups that favor the eradication of Man or the  preservation of the status quo, or a wait-and see attitude. The tales and  those who tell them make the best of this work. The four books together  will, I'm sure weave all these plots together. It takes time my fellow  readers! This will probably be the most personal of the set. I liked it,  even though I have not a inkling what the Shrike may be, or how it's church  arose. I can't wrap my head around the time tombs or some of the weird  things in the travelers stories. I have a lot of respect for Dan Simmons. I  like his work, his style and his mind.

Admirable.In  this installment of LEGIONS OF FIRE , Vir has to cobble together a  resistance movement -with the help of some inept seeming mages- and keep  himself alive amongst the Drakh infested Centauri inner circle all the  while being his Vir-like self. There is a great deal of pure adventure in  this book, a well written tale... to be continued of course. But to fans of  The Excalibur storyline.. Guess where Galen turns up? mmmhmmm! Londo has  his cross to bear and as we know (or do we?) it will be the death of him.  Our reassurance that Vir is in fact still harmless in Drakh thinking comes  from the thoughts of Emperor Mollari himself. A worthy read. Essential to  the legend.	2000-06-17
US	50342216	R35UGHS9MH7TL7	0553572393	710568866	Green Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Them vs. Us ; Us vs. Them : Capitalism faces Eco-Terrorism	Again Kim Stanley Robinson has described the future in terms we readers can savvy. I want to parallel this work with Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, but there is no central character to fix upon. The desperate  Earth seems to be much too willing to believe that Mars is an exotic chest  of riches available to be exploited for the price of passage. The RED MARS  generation- the first settlers- are so diverse in goals ( unrealized after  these many years, a work still in progress..) that they are almost god-like  in detachment. Corporate Earth is ready to exploit and fill the gaps... Too  woo and play the different camps of the &quot;little gods&quot; . I have  alluded to the work of Joseph Conrad here, But in the visualization, the  gritty feel of the isolated camps and the difficulty of life, Frank  Herbert's DUNE may flesh the feeling. Maybe. This is still a highly  technical work, complicated psycologically, but worthy of the work before;  RED MARS. Gerontologists note: There is something for you to ponder  here....... Read GREEN MARS. There is another. Join Me in BLUE MARS. Let's  see where we all go!	2000-06-17

As any Constant Reader of the King Experience knows, it takes some time and inner searching to glean what the man is saying. Some novels are pure pulp; some are psycholgical explorations; others, pure science fiction. In  the Dark Tower series, I have felt an attempt at alienation - non specific,  that is to say not aimed at any type of reader or fan(atic)- but something  to say to those who believe in Vampires or sentient rabid dogs, spaceships  buried beneath the soil of Maine, Insane trucks, laundry machines or  malevolent lawnmowers - those who would judge the work THE GUNSLINGER  simply because of the first few pages. &quot;I don't want to read a horror  Zane Grey novel! &quot; they shout. I don't either, and I didnt. What I  read was a book full of the joy and terror of a man exploring a new type of  storytelling. A beginning to inflame the thirst of New and old Constant  Readers. Magnificent imagery, convoluted turns of reality. Just enough to  cling to the promise of the next installment of The Dark Tower. Excellent  work. Superior continuity... unbearable &quot;waiting for the next  thing&quot;.	2000-06-13
US	50342216	R2QQOCU2AKMYAG	0553560735	710568866	Red Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Hard Science Fiction for Potential Colonists	Kim Stanley Robinson has pulled off the best 'wagon train to Mars ' scenario I could imagine. This book reads like a journal of science fact encompassing the disciplines of physics, astronomy, physiology, psychology,  criminology,.. just about any &quot;ology&quot; there is. Instead of cold  case studies, this 'journal' is told from the point of view of those  involved in the development of a new branch of the human species. A  personal experience for the tellers and narrators, since they are this new  human. This is hard science fiction. As close to the real and dangerous  business of space travel as it's possible to get. Radiation storms, debris  fields, equipment malfunction, everything in Murphys green earth, ( Or  Robinsons RED MARS )that can go wrong or threaten to go amok, does. The  author has used his words to describe the magnificent desolation of the  planet in a way that a fantasy like Ray Badbury's THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES  could not attempt, yet these two works are bound together by the human  factor. Avarice, jealousy, despair and lonliness are balanced by the  determination of the few to survive and push ahead in a new land. The scale  of the project(s) are terrifing; awesome. Agendas abound. Creativity  flourishes in a way we Terrans could not imagine. Make no mistake - This  book is two-in-one. There is a book about the ancient world we call Mars,  and a book about the faulted, fragile beings from the next planet over who  come to wrest a new life from it.	2000-06-11

As a science fiction reader I have always avoided books with dragons or dragonriders on the cover. Any volume with a knight on the front was a historical novel to be avoided. Shame on me. The  real hoot about this thing is that I didn't mean to order this book!  Several years ago I had an audio tape of one of the PERN books by Anne  McCaffrey, and attempted to listen to it on a long car-trip. Unfortunatly,  A three year old with numerous complaints kept me from hearing every other  word. Scratch one. Now I have had a great experience reading Terry  Goodkind's DEBT OF BONES, George R.R. Martin's Wonderful THE HEDGE KNIGHT,  and the sadly overdue ( for me ) RUNNER OF PERN, by Anne McCaffrey. Thank  you to the editors for including a complete list of related works . I spent  a hot South Alabama day under my porch umbrella with this book and my ever  present cold beer loving every minute of it.	2000-06-11

In Babylon 5 it manifests itself in the Earth-Minbar war, started by a paranoid Commander spurred by tales of alien conquerers from beyond,  curiously enough spread by another alien race, the Centauri. In this work  we predate the B5 we know and love by a century and a half. Among us appear  telepaths, suddenly and unexpectedly. As science struggles to understand  these new Homo Sapiens good old fractious big brother steps in and attempts  to calm a populace that was mildly curious at best and slightly nervous at  worst. Then the stuff hits the fan. Opportunists spring upon the fanned  fears of the people and the telepaths are killed, maimed, or put into  concentration camps.&quot;Teeptown&quot;. Docile, some go for safety's   sake. Others, the baddies, the ones who will breed the future are driven  off planet to death and worse on the colonies. In the midst..Psi-Corps  arises. Set up by committee to ferret out their own kind... Who could blame  them? Gathering their kind away from the mundanes. Unknowingly obeying the  will of the machinations set up to destroy them. No wonder those of  Bester's ilk arose. To us B5 loyalists, a lot of familiar names... and old  familiar problems. Our Babylon 5 world fleshes out more back toward our  time than ever before. Read this book if you want to know what would happen  if telepaths were revealed tomorrow.	2000-06-11

It reads like the secret history of a group of serious seekers of ancient knowledge exciting the imaginations of devoted acolytes. Somewhere down the line however somebody got hold of a copy of  &quot;Chariots of The Gods&quot; and queered the whole deal. Recent  pronouncements by the community of geologists suggest that the poles have  indeed wandered the Earth. The mechanics do not suggest a wholesale slip of  landmasses. I will adimit that on Sinco de Mayo while I drink a cool beer  next to the Gulf of Mexico under my umbrella that I will keep a wary eye  toward the Southern horizon. And I will probably be re-reading ( with  enjoyment) Richard Noone's &quot; 5-5-2000 &quot;.	2000-03-20

Maybe we do know the fate  of Londo.. Maybe not. This book is an example of the surprises that may  develop in the next incarnation of B5. Vir falling for Mata Hari (Centauri  styled) Londo making use of his weaknesses as strengths... What in the  world will happen next? Remember &quot;Keep On Trekkin'&quot;? Don't give  up. There is a lot in the mind of Peter David. Read this book.	2000-03-20
