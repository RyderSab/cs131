Surprisingly--Kenny Norton's name does not make the list.  <br /> <br />The physical layput of the book is very interesting. The pages alternalte betwwen parch paper and tradtional book pages. The chapter layouts are disjointed but make for interesting visual as you read. <br /> <br />One one criticism is that the flow of the book is a bit disjointed at times so that you dont know where Ali is going with the flow of the chapters. maybe that was done on purpose, but I found it a little off kilter at times. <br /> <br />The graphics in the book have the look and feel of the 'SHROUD OF JESUS' imprint. <br /> <br />Read this book if you are looking for inspiration from a man who could have sounded bitter about his life but chose to meet the challenge head on and live life to the fullest	2005-03-06

I had a natural curiousity about how Bill would have discussed his affairs with the several women he had affairs with. He discusses and defends each one of them from a point of view that he was just about falsely accused. This leaves the reader, justifiably, with the point of whether or not his personal life should have been exposed as much as it was. Does the President have to admit wrong-doing in his bio? Maybe not. <br />The photos included are a inclusive snapshot of some of the major occurences of his administration.  <br />The last 4 chapters are too quickly discussed. A paragraph to some very major events which could have been a book onto themselves.  <br />I recommend this book. It is extremely well written and flows smoothly.	2005-02-28

The ' I was there and they thought I was a female tiger amongst men' message over and over again gets tired after a while. The photos of the author with the presidents are ok but Ms. Thomas should have included those moments in history that she was a part of, Nixon's resignation, Clinton intern scandal, Reagan--Iran-Contra, etc. Ms. Thomas' final third of the book is excellent.

In this book, when he wrote in the 1st person as Christ, I found it distracting to the rest of the book and somewhat childish. When he wrote of the amount of money the Saudis have invested in our country, my attention was locked in. Its kinda like when you look at him and see his oafish mannerism and physique--it makes me wonder why this guy can't get himself into better shape so he can initially be taken seriously.	2005-01-03

As with the Donnie Brasco book, the discussion of the good guys(lawyers, commisioners) became tedious.
