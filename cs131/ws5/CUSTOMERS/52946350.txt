A man unexpectedly dies, leaving his loved ones to struggle with their grief--a story that has been written probably thousands of times over the years.  Assuming the characters are well drawn, this storyline will not bore.  But if the characters are a disagreeable, two-dimensional lot, well, the result will be uninspirational.  And, ultimately, this book did not inspire me.  Rarely do I put aside a book in which I'm over halfway invested, but I made an exception in this case.  I just didn't care what would happen.	2004-04-15

The author has crafted a truly fabulous, riveting story and created interesting characters, but the book suffers from his writing style and the chronological construction.  Because the main plot action, the riot, is interrupted by the characters' various backstories, it feels like it takes forever to reach a climax and the book drags to its conclusion.  I would also echo one reviewer's complaint about the author's excessive use of italics.  I know it sounds nitpicky, but each page has several lines of italics, some of which appear without apparent reason.  Are they meant to be the private musings of the character?  Well, sometimes.  At other times, they refer to lines already written; still other times, they appear to be simply regular sentences meant to move along the narrative.  I can't emphasize enough how IRRITATING it is to be constantly &quot;interrupted&quot; by italics whose purpose is unclear!<br />I think the author is a good storyteller and, for that reason, I will pick up &quot;Dreamland,&quot; hoping it is as good as its reviews. But if I see that it has excessive italics, I will not read it!	2004-03-26

In fact, I noted that I read ALL the related books that Amazon recommends!  This one has got to be the best.  In a very straight-forward and succinct fashion, Dr. Brandt explains what Botox, fillers (such as collagen), and peeling/exfoliation treatments can do.  If you've ever read any books by Perricone and tried to get through his detailed 'dermis' explanations or biochemistry lessons, you'll know what I mean.<br />I think other writers (such as Perricone) try to persuade (read: sell their products) by overwhelming the reader with their credentials and medical jargon.  Brandt doesn't have to:  he administers more Botox than any other doctor in the U.S.; he knows his stuff and he informs you in layperson language. (Thankfully for me, my dermatologist is a patient of Dr. Brandt's and is the second largest user of Botox).<br />Everthing that Dr. Brandt says about what these procedures can and can't do has been true for me.  There are so many exciting developments that don't require invasive plastic surgery.  Dr. Brandt explains how these procedures can help stave off the anti-aging process for those of us \\"ordinary\\" folk who have accepted the looks we were born with and don't want to completely alter them (like one celebrity who has been in the news lately); we just want to look as refreshed as we feel.	2003-02-15

I'm not at all like Rebecca, the protagonist of this book:  I am not 53, I am not widowed, I don't have a brood of family members to look after.  But this woman's story really resonated with me.  Who hasn't wondered--at ages 20, 30, 40, or 50--how our lives might life had been different?<br />Anne Tyler is so skilled at making a particular character's concerns universal.  (And, I should add, this is the first of the author's books that I have read).  How many of us make deliberate choices, and how many of us are propelled by inertia?  This issue was subtly but brilliantly captured by Peter, the nerdy step-grandson and his musings about physics and his inventions.<br />I found many layers in this book that I will consider for some days to come, I'm sure.  Some characters were fuller than others, but I don't think this distracts from the story, which is really about Rebecca.	2003-01-19

I love the Latin-American type of magical realism, and I read this as a cultural variant--much more subtle and (perhaps?) more skilled.<br />Whether or not the novel's experiences of Pi were actual, we find, at the end, that it doesn't matter.

I can't believe I didn't hear more about it when it was first published, but rather came upon it in its paperback edition.  Amazon is right that the narrator's voice ranks with the likes of Huck or Scout.  And the lyricism of the writing is manifest in the voices of each distinct and very memorable character.  I swear, even if there were no plot (and this one is very good and artful), I would read the book just to savor the poetry in each character's voice.  And I can't forget the poem of Sundance, which was a perfect foil and even a metaphor for separate attributes of each character:  Rube, Swede, Davy, their father, etc.  The magical realism isn't something you often find in American literature, but it makes a lot of sense weaved into a tale of a family in America's heartland.<br />After reading this, I realized my Christmas shopping for the year is done!	2002-11-08

Books	1	112	143	N	N	I feel sorry for her	Given the positive pre-press I read about the English-language version of this book-and there was SO much!-I felt I was predetermined to enjoy it.   I was wrong.<br />I wanted to read a memoir about a woman with whose sexual life I had something in common, even knowing I had not experienced quite such a level of, um ... activity.  I wanted to learn what drove her to be so promiscuous:  Physical drives?  Insecurity?  A need to please?  A desire to be dominant?  Or submissive?  Perhaps just a motivation to live `la vida loca' or trump everyone else's adventures?<br />Even having read the book, I can't answer these questions.  I certainly knew it wouldn't be erotica, but I was interested in how an accomplished woman of her cultural and socio-economic status might relate her experiences to her place in our times.  After all, she is of an age to have been exposed to feminism.  <br />Amazingly, even given her self-absorption, she turns out not to be introspective in any manner that enlightens readers.  I finished this book not understanding her motivations yet suspecting, sadly, that they had something to do with self-annihilation.  (She writes disturbingly about disassociating herself from her sexual encounters--and who wouldn't, if you let a line of Parisian workers have a go at you in the back of a corrugated metal municipal van that leaves your backside raw)?<br />And dare I, as an American, say it without sounding close-minded or ethnocentric?--the intellectual posturing was so \\"French\\".  There was NOTHING intellectual about the author's reminiscences about her escapades.  Such intellectualism would imply cultural context--and there was none.  There are no clues about the years in which she lives or the cultural pressures/dictates by which she might be influenced.   <br />If readers can't draw broader conclusions from her experience that might relate to their lives, why read this?	2002-07-13

It's more of a character-driven and introspective novel with a richness of detail that is very evocative of the time and location.  It was hard for me to believe that a man wrote this, inasmuch as the protagonist is a woman and his characterization resonated so profoundly with me. The careful attention to detail does not weigh down the storyline, though; this must have been very hard to accomplish!  One side note (that shows my ignorance about this form of writing):  why does the author not use quotation marks when writing dialogue?  I found this a little disconcerting, but then it also contributed to the feeling that so much of the converstion mirrored the characters' internal dialogue(...)	2001-12-06

It resonated with me because of my (tenuous) Lithuanian roots.  The foods, the sayings, the strictures of Catholicism, the roles relegated to women, the Old Country stories--all struck a chord in me.  Don't be put off if you aren't of Eastern European background; this will be of interest to anyone who has an interest in the peoples who have come to America in this century.

The title on the cover, depicted in lower case with Vietnamese diacritics over the letters, exhibits a shocking insensitivity to Vietnamese language and culture.  The novel is no better.  Anyone with the slightest familiarity with Vietnamese people--particularly those who came to the United States--will not recognize the characters.

The leader of your community (in this book's case, the pastor) asks you to quarantine you and your family--while you don't know how the disease is spread.  Would you willingly sequester yourself with people who might spread the illness to you?<br />Such is one dilemma that faces the characters in this book.  It's not the only dilemma, by far, but the one that compelled me the most.<br />This book is multi-faceted in the layers it explores.  It is character- and plot-driven, but also manages to weave in historical aspects and, thus, credibility.  And it reads like a novel!<br />I don't like &quot;historical novels&quot; as a rule.  They oftentimes take too much liberty with the history and focus on the characters.  This one does in a way, too, but with a subtletly that belies the research and the well-written dialogue.  It's a page-turner that you can read without feeling you've wasted your time on froth.<br />In the end, it's a great story.  I really, really liked it, especially for the psychological/historical angles.	2001-08-22

Reading all the spirited debate here, I found myself asking just what makes a book worth reading (or not).  And, with this one, I found myself reviewing it on several levels:<br />As a summer-type book that gets the reader turning pages, it's pretty good.<br />If you care about writing style, it's just so-so.  The poetry and songs were nice, however.<br />If you're looking for an accurate, historical treatise on honor killings in Korea, well, as others have pointed out, it doesn't wash well with what we know about Korean history.  Maybe Omma's fate is recounted accurately, but it is not fair to generalize the event to all of Korean culture during that time.<br />I found myself wishing that this were written as a novel and not as a memoir.  I think a lot of the problems I had with it would have been resolved thusly.  For example, had it been a novel, the author would be given license with the facts.  And she could have extended the character's suffering to larger questions about cultural differences, fundamental Christianity, how much childhood affects the choices we make as adults, etc.<br />If you read this as a memoir (with all the credibility a reader is supposed to attach to it), then it does become self-pitying and, well, incredible.  People live their lives in shades of gray; even those who have suffered the bleakest, darkest circumstances know that how you deal with/respond to your life experience is what determines your future.  Kim doesn't appear to want to accept this responsibility.  <br />Even if her entire rendering of events is true (which seems hard to believe), Kim comes across as reveling in Victim Mode.<br />I really wanted to like this book, especially because I had hoped it would cover some of the experience of modern-day immigrants to America.  But if failed woefully in this regard as well.  I just don't think her thoughts were very introspective, and I don't feel she has overcome her angst or redeemed herself in any way.	2001-08-12

It is THE classic account of the Gold Rush era, mostly because it isn't tarnished by revisionism--it was published in 1855!  It has served as the first informational source for both researchers and novelists alike.  But this review is intended for those who might not be familiar with the history of California, or may have read only the novels, journalism, or light non-fiction treatments.  Don't be put off by the publication date or the book's level of detail--it is a very enjoyable read!  The authors were not scholars or historians, but rather a doctor, a lawyer, and a journalist.  It is jam-packed with anecdotes and factoids that will make you appreciate even more the accounts of Mark Twain, Joaquin Miller, Ambrose Bierce, Bret Harte, Henry George, etc.  It is truly the root of the fruit.	2001-08-04

Even though I am not very acquainted with things Japanese, it smelled false and exploitative to me.  <br />I realize that it's difficult to &quot;novelize&quot; a cultural tradition--especially when it's targeted to readers outside of the native culture--but I think the author used every Western convention to make this book appeal, and therefore it suffers from a romance novel-type whitewash that, in the end, just doesn't ring true.<br />Read this if you want some mind candy.

The excerpts from Dinesen's  writing can be irksome, however, when the author supposes they are  thinly-veiled accounts of her true life.  Some of these suppositions  require a real leap of faith--especially because, most times, the gender  must be transposed for Donelson's theory to hold water.  <br />I did not find  that the medical notes were the focus of, or detracted from, the book as a  whole.<br />I have to ask:  why is this book so doggone expensive?

For  this reason alone, Benemann's compilation is mouth-watering.  If, on top of  this voyeurism, you are intersted in Gold Rush history, then this is the  book for you!  Benemann does a noteworthy job of roping together accounts  of Argonauts  and their experiences under common themes so that the  individual contributions don't seem disjointed.  As a native San Franciscan  who was reared constant tidbits of California history (even as a college  student with access to the Bancroft Collection), I was neverthless  surprised to learn so very many new things about my City.  <br />My only  complaint is that I would have liked to know more about the writers  themselves.  I believe that this is not the fault of Benemann, but rather  that more of their personal history is not available.<br />Side note to fellow  Californians:  I first came upon this book at the Sacramento Public Library  in their beautiful history room; I ordered it from Amazon as soon as I  returned home.

Was I right!  While Kuki Gallman has an extraordinary life  and is possessed of an inspiring character, courage, and a real 'joie de  vivre', she should have worked with a writer who can fashion language  sensibly.  Many sentences were endless and a tangle of misplaced commas and  misused words.  Kuki alludes to being a poet; perhaps she believes that her  style is lyrical--I found, though, that I often had to re-read sentences to  try to capture the object of the verb.  This is not poetic!  And you don't  want to know how many typos are contained in the pages.  Shame on the  editor!<br />The stories themselves are compelling, but very derivative of her  first book.  I admit I can't walk away without admiration for Kuki.   Nevertheless, it kind of &quot;galled&quot; me that she has the ego to  presume her story worthy of publication when it is so poorly written and,  further, that she supposes people can relate to a woman of privilege who  has not had to work to earn all the splendor she enjoys.	2000-08-12

Benemann has done a great job of roping in  important historical tidbits with the correspondence and journal entries he  includes.

My only disappointment was not being able to know more about  the writers' lives (--no fault of the editor, since such information is  unavailable).<br />What a wealth of information the Bancroft Library must  include!

If you are at all  interested in California history, this is a must-read.  <br />(Side note to  fellow Californians:  I first saw this book on a visit to the California  history room of the Sacramento Public Library, and was so engaged that when  I returned home I immediately ordered it from Amazon.

Wrong!  What could have been a compelling tale is botched up by the skilless jumps forward and backward in time.  (Usually, if a good writer tells us at the outset what happens to one of the main characters -- in this case, a murder -- the subsequent description of things leading to up the the event are more interesting than the event itself.  Not the case in this book).  The historical framework of Guatemala is leaked in awkward places in the narrative, and the usage of Spanish-language phrases are often translated when they don't need to be, or not translated when they should be.

I was very disappointed in this book, especially given the highly favorable reviews. However, unlike some other readers, I did not struggle with the author's maritime terminology, even though I have been afloat on nothing bigger than a water ride at Disneyland.  (I found the descriptions instructional).  Instead, my quarrel is with the story's non-linear presentation, and the fact that the author, by writing at the outset of the Andrea Gail's passengers and their loved ones, sets the stage for an involvement with these people which is never given an opportunity to develop.  At the point in the book when the author might have supposed more of the doomed passengers' emotional reactions to their violent conditions, he instead relies on historical accounts of (much earlier) boating disasters, and on the experiences of survivors of other boats during the same storm.   I was left to wonder who, exactly, the protagonists were meant to be.  The fact that the author uses the title &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (implying, in meteorogical terms, the convergence of highly unusual weather conditions) is very apt.  The book is more about an unlikely weather event than it is about the people who experienced it.  For other &quot;armchair&quot; adventurers like myself who like to read of people in distress under conditions of nature, I would recommend &quot;Into the Wild&quot; by Job Kraukaer (NOT &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, by the same author, a book which suffers from the same maladies as &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;).  &quot;Into the Wild&quot; would have been a good template for the retelling of this boating disaster:  a perfect blending of painstaking fact-gathering, a knowledge of the caprices of nature, and an ample dose of psychology.	1997-12-31

I have wearied, in recent years, of reading novels by authors whose characters are interesting only by virtue of their being from the South, and whose plots depend on rural Southern details and the characters' Southern eccentricities.  I feel this is a cheap ploy, so I wasn't particularly interested in picking up Gibbons' book, Charms for the Easy Life.  But I'm glad I did!  OK, the novel benefits from its &quot;Southerness&quot;, but I got the sense that such a skilled writer as Gibbons could make proper Bostonians glow in realism.  This book is not only a delightful read, but it also touches on the not-so-easy relationships between mothers and daughters, and the equally difficult relationships between women and men.  Gibbons also exhibits a detailed (but not obvious) research of the Depression Era, and, on top of it, she makes a sturdy comment about the value of non-traditional medicine.  My only complaint is about the book's resolution, which came too quickly and tidily for me.  Although I read it in one afternoon, the characters have stuck to my ribs and, the more I think about the book, the more its layers are revealed to me.	1997-12-08

If you are looking for a treatise for or against capital punishment or the values or demerits of prison reform, this is not the book for you.  Instead, Masters portrays his prison life plainly, and without posturing, religious &quot;one-upmanship&quot;, or political commentary.  Instead, he tells of his own day-to-day existence and that of his fellow prisoners without the judgment most of us would inject were we in his position.  Despair and his probable death are interwoven subtly, but seemingly without guile.  His chronicle of improbable transformation from criminal to Buddhist practitioner is applicable to anyone struggling to find a spiritual homestead, and makes the book easy to relate to whether or not the reader shares a similar background with the author.  Without explicitly making the intention known, he teaches us all that we are prisoners behind walls of our own erection, and that the only way to escape our prison is to look within.	1997-12-01

I expected this account to be more like the author's previous book, Into the Wild, in which he added to the available news accounts by adding his own research and suppositions.  While Into Thin Air is certainly well-written, it offers too little beyond what anyone interested in the topic of mountain-climbing already knows (or, indeed, of anyone who heard the news at the time).	1997-10-19
