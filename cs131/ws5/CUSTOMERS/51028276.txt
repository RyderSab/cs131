US	51028276	R1MB43BMSDNG7Y	0684803860	59773996	The Daughter of Time	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Fiction?	This book was recommended to me during a family discussion on whether or not Richard III was guilty of killing his two nephews.  I expected this book to be a biography, but it is presented in a fiction form of an inspector and a student looking into the mystery of Richard III while the inspector was bedridden.  The dialogue in the book is between the inspector and the student, who is doing the research at the British Museum.  The student then brings the research information back to the bedridden inspector.  There are some good points made in the book which casts doubt on the general history's portrait of Richard III as the evil uncle.  Although the book is well written and make interesting points, I cannot help be wonder whether or not the information is fiction because of the way Tey presented the story.  Tey shows alternate theories of what may have happened to the Princes in the Tower.	2001-04-12
US	51028276	R1TSP0S49W9B8E	0446609404	95144783	Cradle and All	Books	1	2	3	N	N	Just Weird	Unlike any other Patterson books you will ever read.  I am a huge fan of Patterson's Alex Cross stories, but thought that his non-Alex Cross books, such as When the Wind Blows, were interesting.  Although this book was a page turner (I finished it in one day), I kept turning the pages to see if the storyline would go anywhere.  Patterson touches upon a religious aspect in this book with the two pregnant virgins, one bearing the Son of God while the other bears the son of Satan.  The storyline sounded a little too weird for me, but I was willing to give it a shot because it was James Patterson.  That was only the beginning of the weirdness as the entire book goes on with a long drawn out story of these two girls' pregnancies with a little side plot here and there.  The side plots are not worth mentioning because Patterson throws it in the storyline to make the reader think about who has the &quot;good&quot; baby and who bears the &quot;evil.&quot;  The ending is even more &quot;weird&quot; that it left me with a collective groan at the end.<br />Definately not the typical James Patterson.  I do not believe the religious supernatural storyline is his forte.  He should stick with Alex Cross.	2001-03-27

The suspense holds the reader until the last page.  However, I find this statment to be true for the Alex Cross novels because this book not only did not take hold of my attention, but I actually stopped reading half way through.  I'm not sure if the book gets better, but it is not the usual Patterson which is interesting from chapter 1.  Simply put, this book was a bore and a disappointment.  Patterson does have some other great books out there, especially those with Alex Cross.	2001-03-25
US	51028276	R1WXIP7948WQB5	0345391780	608322438	The Princes in the Tower	Books	3	5	11	N	N	Rename it &quot;Guilt of Richard III&quot;	The title of the book &quot;The Princes in the Tower&quot; is a little misleading in that this book does not focus much on the lives of King Edward V and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York. Instead, Weir touches upon the fact that they &quot;disappeared&quot; and goes into support of the &quot;whodunnit&quot; of their murder. Most of the book focuses on the history of the Wars of the Roses, the House of Lancaster and York, the Plantagents and Wydvilles. At times these strifes and the various characters described in the book can be not only confusing, but weights down the story. Like other &quot;whodunnits&quot;, there are always two sides to the mystery, and this side does lean towards the guilt of Richard III. Weir also takes the reader into the reign of Henry VII and the attitude towards the princes during Henry VII.  The story of the two princes are interesting, if not fascinating. Like Wier's other books, this one also includes great pictures of the characters involved for those people who are visual, like myself.	2001-03-25

Alison Weir does give the reader a lot of information, but the book is pretty easy to follow.  It was not only facinating to read about how and why she ruled the way she did, but also the clothes that made that era truly &quot;Elizabethan.&quot;  Having already read Mary, Queen of Scots, I appreciated reading Elizabeth's point of view regarding the whole &quot;Mary Situation.&quot;  A nicely written book to take the reader through the life of Elizabeth I.  As with Alison Weir's other books, this one contains wonderful portraits of all of the players involved in her life as well as a geneology table to keep them sorted out.	2001-02-07

Although Weir touches upon all of Henry VIII's children as well as his niece, Lady Jane Grey, the majority of this book delves into the life of Queen Mary I.  Wier discusses the short reign of Henry VIII's only son, Edward VI as well as the 9 days reign of Lady Jane Grey; however the book focuses on Mary, and ends at her death and the accession of Queen Elizabeth.<br />Mary was a Catholic like her mother Katherine of Aragon.  She tried so hard to bring Catholism back to England that she has gone into history as earning the nickname &quot;Bloody Mary.&quot;  Mary burned about 300 heretics in her short five year reign.  Mary was portrayed as being merciful, but resorted to flexing her control as she had so many people against her.<br />Weir again introduced the reader to the importance of alliances and marriges of monarchs during the 16th century as well as the importance of religion.  This book is an easy to read narrative of the politics of accession to the English throne after the death of Henry VIII and the adult life of Queen Mary I.  Weir takes the reader into more depth of Elizabeth's reign in her book, The Life of Elizabeth I.  <br />Although it is not necessary for the reader to have read The Wives of Henry VIII in order to enjoy this book, it does help the reader in understanding the genuine hate Mary had for Elizabeth because of Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn.<br />This is another wonderful chapter of The Tudors.	2001-01-01

Although this book does not go into detail of each  monarch, it does give a brief description along with a photograph of the monarch.  This book is divided into chapters starting with The Anglo-Saxons and Danes to The House of Windsor.  Each of the Kings and Queens who reigned during those periods are featured in the perspective chapter.  Each chapter also has a genealogy family tree which helps untangle the web of marriages and remarriages.<br />It is a good picture book to walk the reader through the over 1000 years of the English monarchy.	2001-01-01

It is a wonderful collection of Christmas stories as well as Christmas songs.  The stories include the favorites of A Christmas Carol and The Gift of the Magi, but it also includes stories of Christmases in other countries such as Germany, France and Italy.  Because all of the stories are relatively short, it is such a wonderful way to bring the family together during the holiday season in front of the fireplace, sip on hot apple cider and read out loud the tales of Christmas.

Fraser accounted for a great many details of Mary's life from her upbringing in France to her rule in Scotland and finally to her imprisonment in England.  The details spill over to many others in Mary's court, which made this biography of Mary a little long and laborous.  In Fraser's quest for authencity, she used a great deal of French and Latin phrases, but she did not, at times, define the meaning of the phrases.  Unless the reader if fluent in either language, there is a sense of missing something.  The biography is well researched and the many footnotes, which at times takes away from the flow of the read, prove it.<br />Antonia Fraser's biography of Mary Queen of Scots would be an easy read if the reader can get past the sometimes grueling details of the other individuals in Mary's court.  Despite this obstacle, the life of Mary Stuart, as presented by Fraser, is an interesting one.<br />For those interested in the Stuart and Tudor periods, try Alison Weir's books, which has a much more even flow to it.	2000-12-26

Since I could not get past the style, I could not enjoy the book and get past the first couple of chapters.  This book may have an &quot;amazing&quot; story line (if you can get that far); however the choppy dialect was hard to follow and read.

Not only did Weir explain the background of each of the wives, but she also gave the reader a glimpse of life in the Royal Court during the Tudor period of England.  It was intriguing to read about the alliances and arrange marriages as well as the required dowries.  Not only were the alliances important, but each wife was required to give Henry VIII a male heir.  When a wife failed to do so, she was casted away.  I found it amazing how easy it was for a King to convict someone of high treason and the fate of that conviction, as Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard found out.  Weir also shows just how young and foolish these girls were when they married the King to become the Queen of England.  The moral of the story is not to marry Henry VIII unless you want to gamble with either having an annulement or being beheaded.	2000-12-08

This extraordinary story guides the reader into another, almost secretive, world of the geisha.  It also takes away a lot of the assumptions of the life of a geisha and shows the reader that the geisha is an educated female in not only the old tea ceremony, but also the arts.  I came to understand that the geisha was not a high priced call girl.  This book also gave me a new perspective and respect for these women. What is so amazing is that Arthur Golden writes this book through the eyes of a girl from the time she is groomed to be a geisha through her success in finally becoming one. Wonderfully written.  It will always be one of my favorites.	2000-12-03

However, this book shows the reader the loving and giving aspects of Galileo.  Galileo's eldest daughter, Suor Maria Celeste (Virginia Galilei), paints a vivid picture on how much unconditional love and happiness Galileo's daughter brought to him.  Whether it be a request by Suor Maria Celeste for money, cloth or food, Galileo always came though with his help.  Suor Maria Celeste's letters also show that there were no limits to what she would do for her father.<br />Dava Sobel touches on Galileo's scientific achievements which is fascinating.  This book carries the reader into perhaps one of the saddest event of Galileo's life which was to be &quot;suspected of heresy, namely of having held and believed the doctrine which is false and contrary to the Sacred and Diving Scriptures, that the Sun is the center of the world and does not move from east to west and that the Earth moves and is not the center of the world...&quot;<br />As Suor Maria Celeste was Galileo's constant companion in life, she remains with him in death at Santa Croce.  Galileo's Daughter walks the reader through the world of Galileo as a father, scientist, mathematician and philosopher.  What a wonderful book to capture all the essence.	2000-11-18

The storyline tempts the reader and lays ideas that &quot;something&quot; has happened to both of the main characters, Jack and Laurel; however, it is slow at revealing what the &quot;something&quot; is.  Unlike Hoag's other books which starts off with a murder mystery, the first half of the book delves into a the love story part of the plot.  Because I enjoy Hoag for the Who-Dunnit stories, I felt that the first half dragged on.  Not a bad read, but does not measure up to my favorite, A Thin Dark Line.  Both Cry Wolf and A Thin Dark Line take place in South Louisiana, a place that is near and dear to my heart.	2000-11-12

This books walks the reader through her early childhood years through her tragic death.  It shows some honesty in the pain which she felt from her parents' divorce and later, Camilla Parker-Bowles.  Anyone who is a fan of Princess Diana will sympathize along with the book.

Although the reader is introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lecter in this book, it is actually the serial killer, Francis Dolarhyde who takes center stage.  Dolarhyde is so cunning that it seems like he could have taught Dr. Lecter a few &quot;tricks.&quot;  In this story, F.B.I. Agent, Will Graham seeks help from Dr. Lecter to find a killer on the loose.  There are many turns in this book that, if shared, will ruin the entire plot.  I feel that I cannot disclose much of the plot as any new reader would want to live the suspense and thrill as I have.

The great mix of mystery  and wizardry made this book a page turner for me.  I kept reading because I wanted to know what the Chamber of Secrets was all about.  All the adventures Harry, Ron and Hermione were amusing as well.  Since the book was written for pre-teens, most of the themes, such as belong to a group and having a school bully, are easily relatable to that age group.  However, as an adult, I found the book to be a wonderful light hearted story with a feel-good ending.  Besides, all of us (even adults) can relate to belonging to a group and being around a bully.  I'll just to have to keep reading to see what Harry does next!	2000-09-30

(Excellent)	As one of Michelangelo's biggest fans, I can truly say that Irving Stone  did an incredible job on this biographical novel.  Although Michelangelo  was known as a sculptor, painter and architect, his greatest love was the  marble, and this book shows it.<br />I just returned from a two week  vacation through Italy where I stayed in Florence for about a week.  The  streets and piazzas where Michelangelo and Granacci walked has been  captured by Stone in true detail.  San Marco and Santa Maria Novella are  extactly as Stone describes.  I have also seen most of Michelangelo's works  and it is wonderful to see the personal &quot;story&quot; behind each of  the works.  Not only does this book walk with you though Michelangelo's  life, but it also gives the reader a piece of Italian history with the  Medici family and the Pope.  This book gives me another justification why  Michelangelo is God sent.  No one should judge his work until they have  stood in front of David and the Pieta or looked up at the Sistine Chapel.  It is one of the most incredible experiences of my life.<br />This book may  not be an easy read to some because the Italian names may be hard to  follow.  Some of the historical conflicts among the Medici family, the Pope  and Savonarola may be a bit confusing if the reader is not familiar with  the attitudes of that time.  There are also a minutia of Italian phrases  which may be confusing to those who do not understand Italian.  But if you  are looking for a great book that not only gives you the history, but the  emotion, then this is for you.	2000-04-22

This guide covered it all.<br />You can forget the credit cards,  but DO NOT LEAVE HOME WITH THIS ONE!	2000-04-08

I read this book before going and was able to get an idea of what London was about, but when I arrived, this book did not leave my hands!  This guide divides London into sections and  we were able to go out and explore by using those areas.  The  street-by-street and Tube maps were invaluable and we were never lost.  I  am the worst with directions, but I knew extactly where I was during each  day.  With the maps, I navigated instead of my husband!  The cut aways and  guides to the various museums and attractions were also invaluable.  We  were able to walk into any attraction and know what the star features were  and not have to miss a thing.  The resturant guide took us to the best  place for fish and chips and the history section gave us an idea of what  the city is all about.  I was able to give two fellow U.S. tourists  directions to the theatre district and to their specific theatre becaus I  had my Eyewitness Guide and they did not.<br />You can forget the credit  cards, but DO NOT LEAVE HOME WITH THIS ONE!	2000-04-08

Just as the reader gets involved in the character or plot the story ends and proceeds to the next one.  Binchy's  books that stick with one grand story is definately better.	2000-04-08

It had a very week storyline and the reader did not get to truly know a character.  I am a great Binchy fan, but was disappointed in this one.  The story was too  predictable.	1999-12-09

The  mini character stories were choppy and not developed in the usual Binchy  fashion.  I did not feel like I knew the characters as well as the other  Binchy books.	1999-11-21

Gale Gand is the best pastry chef and is inspirational to me, an aspiring home baker.  Her dessert creations are sinfully amazing, but yet so easy that the home baker can recreate.  These wonderful desserts are more like  small works of art.  Truly tantalizing!	1999-11-07

Evening Class is the 4th Binchy book I have read, but it is not the typical Binchy book compared  to Circle of Friends, Glass Lake and Echoes.  I was left not really knowing  the characters.  Because there were so many characters, Binchy was not able  to fully develop them.  I did not walk away feeling like I really can  relate to any of the characters.  The storytelling part of the book is very  grand.  Binchy is truly a master to interweave so many characters together.   My next one will be Light a Penny Candle!	1999-10-27

I can picture Castlebay in my mind's eye as if I just returned from a summer vacation there.  I felt that I was not finished when I turned the last page.  Maeve  left the future of Clare and David to the reader's imagination.  This is my  third book by Maeve, and I am reading Evening Class next!	1999-10-17

It tells each of us not to take anything for granted and that we can all live through life's stuggles and prevail at the end.  Winnie is a strong character whom I respected throughout the  book.  I could not put this book down.  A must read!	1999-10-12
