Then at the very end he takes Livvey away from her family that REALLY needs her, to live in a swamp and have lots of babies?? Come on! What was wrong with building their own little cabin over by the woods and stream? Why not live near the people that love her? It's not like he had anything actually waiting for him in the swamp, Noah was very selfish and self centered. I just hope all those babies sprout wings or they are in for more heartbreak.	2001-10-21

After all the poor child endured he was going to live and have a happy ending. I hate to say anything other then raving reviews for Susan Wiggs, but this book just didn't grab me like Circle in the Water did. It was sooo slowww, I must have set it down a hundred times before I was able to make it to the end. When the gypsies showed up I became hopeful but they didn't stick around long enough to bring some of the jubilant happiness they had shared with us in CITW. At then end of the story a baby girl is born to Oliver and Lark, they name her Philippa and this is when I find out there is a third book Dancing On Air that Thank Goodness I have in my TBR pile. But, what had me so excited about Oliver's story is I was introduced to him in lengthy detail in CITW and finding out there is another story about this baby just doesn't excite me, I don't have that link with the baby. It would have been nice to have some of her childhood in this book so I would have been more compelled to see how she turns out in Dancing On Air.	2001-03-19

I think these two books should have been left under separate covers and maybe you should wait some time between the stories so when your reading TOI you aren't left with the feeling of reading the same story twice.

It was a good book, kept me interested, not sure if it was out of disgust, infatuation, or interest. Whitney starts  out with a personality you just have to love, spirited and feisty. Her  father is a moron of a man that doesn't see the treasure he has in this  girl. Then she meets Clayton. What a guy... right. Takes me back to what a  moron the father is. Everyone goes on about the beating (which wasn't in my  version) or the rape. But what about the man that sold her in the first  place! What a jerk. But I feel this was the Authors intentions to get our  emotions to a boiling point and it worked! And why did Whitney have to turn  into a sniveling, whining woman? I would have loved to see her spunk  continue as it did in the beginning of the story. I would have loved to see  her really pay that man back for violating her body! I did laugh out loud a  couple times which is unusual for me and I sighed many times when I felt  the romance emit from the pages.

I love how the Author  described the life of the pioneer family. Jonathon had more passion for the  earth and his bull then he did for his own wife, and I found myself feeling  good that she had found this missing part of her marriage with Aaron.

Sophia came from a rich, refined family, with a father that gave very good advice. Although she lived the easy life with servants to do everything for her, she had the  determination to stand up for herself and her dreams and go on an adventure  to tell her unworthy fiance she knew of his unfaithfullness and she wasn't  going to stand for it! She pitched in to help on her journey, ending up  dirty and smelling bad, but she was still a beauty in Jacks eyes. This was  a great book, I highly recommend it	2000-05-20
