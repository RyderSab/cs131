It has a story, then 5-6 ideas of creative things to make that correlate with that story.  It's so much fun!  Stories include: The Gingerbread Boy, Androcles and the Lion, The Little Engine that Could, The Lion and the Mouse, and The Hare and the Tortoise.

After trying, then donating to the library, Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons, I found this book and it is great.  Your child will be able to read a simple two-word sentence AND a simple story by the end of the first lesson.  Although the lessons can be lengthy and should have been split up into more lessons, you can use your own discretion at how much time you want to spend on it (we usually just did 2-3 pages at a time).  Why 4 stars instead of 5?  Writing practice should have been included in this book.  Yes I know they have a whole separate CD-ROM for that but the writing sheets should have been included in the book.  There were a lot of &quot;draw a line to the letter that the picture starts with&quot; that could have been deleted and handwriting practice could have been incorporated in.  Do not let that keep you from buying this book though!  The handwriting practice sheets are very easy to make with your computer at home, it just takes a little planning ahead.	2004-05-27

This is a great book.  It has an information sheet about each state with interesting facts, then it has a couple pages of games related to the facts.  This is one of the neatest, most useful state-study books I've come across yet.  My only gripe?  Well, most states have a letter game where you answer questions about the state using some sort of letter code corresponding with numbers...only problem is, they didn't bother to include the code!  So I've had to waste a lot of time cracking the code myself and typing it up so that my students can do the worksheets.  With the price I paid for the book, I shouldn't have to do that!  (My teacher's aide quipped that I must have forgotten to purchase the secret decoder ring that this book obviously requires.)  Other than that, this is a great book and I highly recommend it for a simple but thorough and informative study of our great country.  <BR>PS I'm intrigued by the idea of sending a stuffed animal all across the country...how does that work?  Please let me know!!  It sounds fun!  LisaM5305@aol.com	2004-01-24

I'm right on the verge of graduating and the only thing standing between me and my degree is this stupid College Algebra class, filled with useless information that I'm quite certain I'll never use again!  Ok now that I've vented about that, I must say that I cannot understand why my college switched from Blitzer's College Algebra 2nd Edition to this text.  As you may have guessed this isn't my first attempt at passing this *#$% class.  A few semesters ago when I took it we used Blitzer's book, and while it was still Algebra and fairly loathesome, at least it was somewhat understandable!  This book is clearly written for students who are good at advanced math and plan to go on to higher math. (Talk of Calculus in the pre-chapter!  God help me!)  Ok, so what if you don't plan on doing that?  What if you are just taking this class because your state government says you have to or you can't graduate?  I wish someone would write a Collge Algebra text for the rest of us!!!	2004-01-24

The title would lead you to believe that this is a book about being content and satisfied while being single.  I found this to not be the case.  While there were a few good points made, this is basically yet another wait-for-a-mate book disguised as a satisfied singles' book.  This is not necessarily a bad book, I just think the title does not fit the content.  I like this author and have highly enjoyed a few of her other books, but this one misses the mark.	2003-12-13

This is one of the few that I'm going to hang onto even after the last page has been read...I have a feeling it's one I'll be reading again (and again).  While Kathleen Hardaway expresses the deep pain and anguish she has felt in the past about being single, in the latter chapters of the book she goes on to describe how she feels that God has blessed her with singleness (me too!).  Her emotions are quite palpable, and if you really give yourself to the content of the book, you will find yourself crying and rejoicing right along with her, because so many of us have those same feelings, and she expresses them so well.  I agree with one of the other reviewers who felt that Ms. Hardaway could have expanded this book to include proper responses to those snide and hurtful comments made by some.  As a single mother, I also wish she would have touched more on the issues that I, and those like me, deal with (although what she did include was very helpful and encouraging).  However, as it stands, this is a wonderful book, a very easy and possibly life-changing read.  Thank you Kathleen!!	2003-12-13

This book had a profound impact on my life.  I was raised in a dysfunctional, ungodly home and didn't become a Christian until age 19, after making many bad choices.  I've not had many female role models in my life but after reading this book I feel that I can consider Diana Hagee to be one.  Through this book Mrs. Hagee basically takes you by the hand and shows you what it means to be a woman of God.  The chapters are as follows: <BR>1) The King's Daughter;<BR>2) My Value in God's Eyes;<BR>3) I Am Not Ashamed of the Gospel; <BR>4) The Holy Spirit and Me; <BR>5) Dreams with a Happy Ending: Setting Goals; <BR>6) Ten Commandments for Women in the Workplace; <BR>7) Women and Courtship; <BR>8) And God Said, \\"Let There Be Sex\\"; <BR>9) Ten Questions You're Afraid to Ask Your Gynecologist; <BR>10) The Favor of God; <BR>11) Hospitality--An Attitude of the Heart; <BR>12) Beauty<br />Please don't look at the title or the chapters and think for a moment that this book holds nothing useful for you.  You will not be sorry if you read it and apply its principles.  Each chapter concludes with \\"Action Points\\", which are questions for you to answer based on the chapter, a short reading assignment from the book of Esther, and a prayer.	2003-11-28

Ladies, have you ever been sitting with your friends, and really want to bring up a topic like this, but just can't find the nerve, for fear that you'll be labeled some kind of immoral nymphomaniac freak?  Well I have, plenty of times, and that's why I'm so thankful for this book.  It's like having 2 godly best friends to ask your most intimate (and sometimes embarrassing questions) to.  Some of the advice surprised me, such as ok-ing the use of vibrators but vetoing pornography, plus giving all the personal anecdotes and biblical references in praise of everything from orgasms to oral sex.  This book will help Christian women create the kind of sexual experiences they truly desire within their marriage.  Also included is what to do when your sex drive is revved up but your husband's is in low-idle.	2003-05-28

I have been involved in an on-again/off-again relationship with an \\"active commitmentphobe\\" (you'll understand what this means when you read the book) for the past 9 years which has produced 2 children and runs the gamut from being extremely painful to being joyful enough to instill false hope in this \\"passive commitmentphobe\\" (just read the book).  I found this book to be unbelievably eye-opening, not just in regards to my guy's bizarre, confusing behavior, but also in regards to the ways in which I enable it.  Honestly if you can only afford one book right now on this subject, I highly recommend this one.  The ONLY gripe I have is that I believe this book could have gone from being eye-opening to life-transforming had the authors included a set of questions to answer at the end of every chapter.  Granted there are questions interspersed throughout the text, but if people are anything like me they probably just read right through them without giving them any serious thought.  When I re-read this book I plan on paying a lot more attention to the questions though, as they are included for a reason, and that reason is to help you identify areas you may need help with, and attitudes that you may not have realized existed.  I don't know about anybody else out there but I'm *sick* of going through these kinds of relationships and I'm ready to move up to higher ground with someone who feels the same way.  This book has been a nice stepping stone and I'm very grateful for it.	2003-05-21

If I could, I'd buy a copy for *every* single Christian woman out there, no matter their age.  I did not become a Christian until age 19, and by that time I had given myself away to a small number of meaningless sexual encounters, not because I \\"wanted to\\", but because I didn't know any better.  No one had ever taught me that my body, my sexuality, and my virginity were special gifts to be held onto and given someday to the right man.  And this isn't another one of those tight-lipped, \\"all sex is evil\\" books written by some stuffy old church ladies, these women fully acknowledge the joys of a woman's sexuality, provided that it is kept in line with God's perfect will for us.  It's true, I wish I had read this book years ago...but I'm just so thankful that I have it now.	2003-05-15

Books	3	8	15	N	N	It's ok	I received this book several days ago and read through it with great zeal after all the excellent reviews it received.  This book generally seems to be intended for 2 audiences: the young contemplating marriage; and the slightly older contemplating re-marriage.  Well, I fall somewhere in the middle, in territory that either wasn't touched on or was barely glazed over.  I've lived with my boyfriend for several years and am at the point that I'd like to get married (he's indifferent to the idea), and was hoping that there would be something in this book to help me navigate the waters that I now find myself in.  In true \\"good Christian\\" form this author doesn't even touch the subject of couples living together without benefit of matrimony.  It's obvious that my boyfriend and I both have commitment issues, which this author dedicates a whole chapter to, but there's nowhere to go from there.  He advocates keeping a positive attitude and keeping marriage a goal in your life, if you truly decide that it's what you want, whether you're actually with the person you're going to walk down the aisle with or not.  He also suggests praying for the significant other rather than shove bridal magazines under his nose.  Both of those points are excellent advice in my opinion.  When it all comes down to it, the only person you can do anything about is you.  The author, a seemingly devout singleton, is rather indifferent towards marriage, he gives encouragement for both sides (marrieds/singles) both from personal counseling experience and Biblical references.  As I said before, this is an ok book, but life isn't always as cut and dried as this book makes it sound, especially for those of us who became Christians later in life than others and are still dealing with choices they made pre-Christian.	2003-02-26

If you're the parent of a preschool age child (3-5) and aren't totally comfortable with the idea of trusting these early learning years to a stranger, I'd strongly recommend this book.  It is packed with encouragement for parents and tons of fun activities to do with kids.  Although the authors advocate beginning (or joining) a co-op preschool at home, it's suitable for homeschoolers too.  A co-op preschool may be something I consider at a later time, but right now we're just getting our feet wet with learning.  I always thought I'd send my precious little one off to a swanky preschool when the time came, but he's 4 now and the time is here, and neither one of us are ready for anything like that.  We're having so much fun playing and learning together.  I always thought learning at home would be frustrating (for me) and boring (for him), but it's really not if you take it in stride and follow your child's lead for the most part.  The first part of this book \\"exposes\\" the history of preschool and why it ever came into being (whereas kids used to start school in 1st grade), and why it may not be the best thing for your child.  It's really sad the way we parents compete with the Joneses...we want our child to talk first, spell first, add first, read first...etc.  And so many of us are afraid that not sending them to preschool will cause them to be \\"behind\\" when the time for actual school (or homeschool) comes.  How many of us have felt like wanting to crawl under the carpet when caught up in a group of of mothers who incessantly brag about their children's accomplishments (\\"My Mary could read when she was 4\\"...\\"My Johnny could add when he was 4 and a half\\"...My Sarah already knows all the names of the planets, and she's only in kindergarten\\"...)  This book deals with all of those questions and insecurities quite well.  Hope you find it as helpful as I have!	2003-01-14

The first few chapters were moderately helpful, as many preschool and kindergarten curricula were reviewed, but to my frustration, only Christian curricula was explored.  I'm a Christian, but I've been considering other curricula such as Oak Meadow, which only received a one-liner in this book.  Also, I was hoping that the reviews would be organized by grade level, but it's not.  It's organized by subject, which means I have to flip through this huge book, scanning for items that might be good for my son's age level.  Who has time for that?  I also didn't appreciate the condescending comment in the first chapter: \\"Plopping in front of the TV with your baby in your lap may be cozy, but it's not very instructive.\\"  Please!  What Mom doesn't become so exhausted at some point during the day that all she can do is plop on the couch with the baby?  As I said, this is an \\"ok\\" book, maybe something handy to have as a reference, but I'm sure there are better resources out there.	2003-01-07

I was hoping to find a collection of romantic, tasteful erotic stories...and there is an element of those things in these stories...but the author frequently uses words that you would expect to see in some trashy porno rag.  Granted that is probably a turn-on for a lot of people, but for me I prefer sensitive, tasteful references to genitalia, especially imagery, which the author includes at times (in one story referring to the woman's genitalia as a &quot;tender bud&quot;).  I read these stories alone, and I couldn't imagine reading them with a partner or having a partner read them to me.  I would be so turned off.	2001-01-14

This book is not at all what I expected...or wanted.  Needless to say, I returned it.  I gave it one star for the great relationship advice.

This wonderful book features just about any artist you can think of (most of which I've never even heard of!).  It's divided into four chapters:  Renaissance &amp; Post-Renaiisance, Impressionists &amp;  Post-Impressionists, Expressionists...&amp; Surrealists (say what?), Modern  &amp; Folk Art.  Each page features a different artist, with a simple  sketch of the artist, a brief biography, and several ideas on how to  re-create that artist's style.  The only gripe I have, which is the reason  it didn't get 5 stars, is that there are not nearly enough reproductions of  the artists' best work.  Many pages show only a picture drawn or sketched  by a student in the style of the artist, which I found extremely unhelpful.   What would have been great is if the publishers would have included a  postcard-size reproduction of the best known artists.  I ended up having to  buy several other books with postcard-size reproductions to use in class.   This book will give you a lot of great ideas, but it's not overly  functional.	2000-09-11
