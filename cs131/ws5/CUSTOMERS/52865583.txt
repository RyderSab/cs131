Horton's book does exactly this!<br /><br />I have been writing software since 1969 in all forms, but mostly engineering applications rather than Windows or web code.<br /><br />Even though I've had the VC++6 compiler since 1998, I'd not used it for anything more than fast prototype code or code that had specific value only to me. Well, with the exception of writing a 'fast fingers' piee to train myself to be really really fast at the \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\" game (a GREAT little app.)<br /><br />my last Windows work had been in 1996/7 and was related to testing cable systems (worse, it was only modifying existing Borland C++ developed under SDK! so I learned little and rememebered less) and some VC++5 code that I worked out in 1997 for a few months.<br /><br />Now I'd bought Ivor Horton's book on VC++5 in about 1997 and had read it occasionally, in very rare moments, so I knew it had quality to it, had the features I value most in a software book: examples and comprehensive detail made explicit.<br /><br />When I recently discovered a new idea for software, I realized that I had to learn VC++6 for true Windows - and I have plenty of reference books on this topic dating from 1992 - it took about two weeks of floundering around with a dozen of them to finally realize that Horton's book on VC++5 was the best of the lot... so I bought his book on VC++6.<br /><br />If you are a beginner, Horton will NOT fail you. The book is immense, over a thousand pages, but it is also easy to understand no matter how rusted you are - and I was well rusted by lack of recent C++ experience.<br /><br />Buy this Book!	2005-09-10

I read the original \\"Rama\\" not long after it was published in the early 70s. I bought my copy of \\"Rama II\\" probably 15 years ago and finally got around to reading it last month. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />No sequel of an excellent book is going to be superior to the original. The ideas won't be as fresh. Consider the various sequels to \\"2001\\" or the \\"Ringworld\\" series. Perhaps the \\"Alien Heat\\" series or \\"Riverworld\\" series managed that feat, but even Asimov's masterworks \\"Foundation\\" became superior fiction only because the author became a much better writer given a 30+ year gap between the trilogy and the rest of the series.<br /><br />Remember how the first Rama crew was 'chosen' by the event of Rama I's arrival? Well, this book suggests a plausible alternate: the leaders of earth - following a Great Depression - are confronted by what appears to be a duplicate Rama, but with plenty of time to select the 'best' cosmonauts, who are given the 24/7 media treatment, and in fact, one of the cosmonauts IS a media type. What is done in this sequel is psrtly an essay on the corruption of a pervasive media and selection of explorers by committee. Yes, a soap opera, sure.<br /><br />The world is just recovering from almost 70 years of a Great Chaos that collapsed the existing space program and all Earth colonies, shook all faith by humankind in the future, and made the re-appearance of another Rama both an opportunity and a dire threat. Just as the survivors of the Depression era of the 1930s never quite got over the fears and uncertainties of everyday life, humankind looks at Rama II with a queasiness. Is this a prelude to another worldwide disaster? Curiosity and world defense are the responses.<br /><br />However, there were a great number of surprising twists and turns in the story. The characters were definitely better drawn, partly because this was a longer novel with a history to explain.<br /><br />No, there were parts of this novel that dragged, or did get lost in the soap opera, but there were also plenty of answers... followed of course by more questions.<br /><br />If there is a disappointment with this novel, it is the lack of a major resolution. Questions that pervaded the entirety of \\"Rama II\\" were not resolved. I'll be reading the next of the series for those,lost in the soap opera, but there were also plenty of answers... followed of course by more questions.  <br /> <br />If there is a disappointment with this novel, it is the lack of a major resolution.

The detail is amazing, to start; Markoff manages to get so many of the major and even the minor players into the book that reading it alone is something of an intelligence test.<br /><br />Above all, though, Markoff has broken through the \\"profit barrier\\" erected by the modern corporations to protect their castles. He has told the stories about what really happened in the development of ideas related to personal computing, the idea of GUIs, and the networking of all computers (and humans!)<br /><br />There is another irritant that I think of as the 'radio conservative' blind spot: how can the one spot on the planet where high technology has created more wealth in the last fifty years than many unions of 'advanced' nations... be so close to the 'liberal' bastion of the (hated to them) San Francisco Bay area? How can that be?<br /><br />'Radio conservatives' are simpletons with crude models of all things human and can't deal with the complexities of reality.<br /><br />They can't deal with Silicon Valley and San Francisco being on the same planet, much less in hated (to them) California, in the United States. No wonder 'conservative radio' panders to the residents of the low IQ states.<br /><br />Markoff has written a book that refutes the sanitized versions of the history of computing.

Many organizations expect or demand their employees to use others for this purpose. This approach was in dire countpoint to my own approach: read the book, do the problems BEFORE class and almost never ask questions of profs. Sadly, self sufficiency in the large corporations is often seen either as a weakness or a threat.<br /><br />Anyway, three years ago I took the old version out of a library, and it was just as clear to me then as it had been 30 years before. I bought a companion volume to make connections with MatLab and other software tools.<br /><br />Here's a suggestion for those who don't like a book: do not use that book alone! If the book which you do not like or find incomprehensible is a textbook, then register your complaints, but find another, better book to complement the one you cannot use easily.<br /><br />35 years ago I had a textbook on differential equations which was extremely difficult - I was not used to difficulties in math at all - and which caused many very talented student engineers, physicist, and mathematicians to bail. ONE book literally shattered their confidence after a lifetime of As and success.<br /><br />I took that book and copied every page of it by hand. If I still didn't understand the text well enough to solve the problems (this text had few examples, if any, and was even on the thin side for leavening text with equations!)... I copied the chapter again! And if I still didn't understand it, a third time! What I then knew: the DiffEq book was great if you wanted to be a theroetical mathematician, but not if you wanted to learn diff eq for anything else. So, it was a brilliant book, it really stretched me out... but of course, the next text in the math for engineers sequence was Kresyzig, which turned diff eq into relatively simple algebra with Laplace transforms...<br /><br />so, other than as a great intellectual 'gut check' the diff eq book was not for someone with five other problems courses to digest.<br /><br />What I know now: if one book isn't enough, then you get another from a library or wherever. Copying chapters of a math book letter for letter is not an efficient way to acquire knowledge or skills.<br /><br />A pointed question for students might be to ask their prof or TA if they used that textbook, AND, if they truly understand it easily. If memory serves, they really like students who find other resources to learn material: ask about other books - hell, they may even loan one to you!next text in the math for engineers sequence was Kresyzig, which turned diff eq into relatively simple algebra with Laplace transforms... <br /> <br />so, other than as a great intellectual 'gut check' the diff eq book was not for someone with five other problems courses to digest. <br /> <br />What I know now: if one book isn't enough, then you get another from a library or wherever.

I'm sure that it made forecasting errors, but also certain that compared to many of the other books which delved into similar terrtory, it was superior (as a book for the general reader.)<br /><br />I also must point out that for software developers with decades of experience in 1996 - this includes Bill Gates - the web took most of us by surprise. However, once nrought to my attention by a younger CSer, I could easily realize the power of it.<br /><br />About a year ago I began reading books on computing and other subjects from an earlier era - the 70s to mid 90s - like \\"The Soul of a New Machine\\" and \\"Future Shock\\" and \\"Hackers\\" among many others. Many of these were excellent books, partly because they got the technology and because they also got the sense of what it was like to be on the cutting edge of technology, however, most are now historical artifacts.<br /><br />Negroponte got the sense of what was happening in certain subsets of digital technology and essentially sounded the warning to those unaware.<br /><br />As always, context is critical.	2005-04-12

Katherine Hepburn was the female lead in dozens of memorable films and there is no one more able to tell her story than the woman herself. This is a fascinating book to read, not because - as one alleged reader claims - it is an egoistical rendering filled with lurid National Enquirer material, but because it tells a strong story about why she became the woman on the screen and the stage... and just the woman herself: her family. Yes, she had great physical beauty which projected perfectly through the film medium, but that doesn't explain the rest.<br /><br />The rest is largely due to her family, the way she was raised by a strong father, with strong female role models all around. THAT is the fascinating part of this book. She gets the core of what made her into print.<br /><br />The son (and his wife) of a friend of mine recently named his new born daughter Katherine, partly under the influence of Hepburn. I had sent him an email about this a few days ago.<br /><br />During one of my two business trips to Silicon Valley in 1991, I had to check the weather before going outside, which I quickly did - rain showers were predicted - and then briefly surfed the hotel cable channels before going outside. Instead, I stumbled on the Phil Donahue show which he was interviewing Hepburn - on film I believe, not in front of the typical audience - and at one point he commented on how few interviews she had ever done and how fortunate he felt to be talking with her, then asked her how she had chosen his program over the others. Hepburn: \\"Well, the people I asked told me that you were good.\\" Donahue: \\"You mean you've never watched my shows before?\\" Hepburn: \\"I don't watch much television.\\" Donahue: \\"I cannot tell how crushed I am now. I can take some solace in the knowledge that your many friends and advisors have brought you to my program.\\"<br /><br />I assume that this was her main PR 'push' for \\"Me.\\" It was late in teh afternoon, my work ws done for the day, so I watched the remainder of the program.

However, in December (2003), I found it very easy to slide into.<br />The implausibility of some of the plot elements, like a long lost love showing up on the same train, simply didn't matter. With good humor and attention to detail, this book will hook you. It helps to have the Holidays running at full boil, too.<br />Perhaps there is a difference between the reader who has often wished to take the time to travel on a train through the Rockies at Christmas, and those who have never entertained the idea. Given the time in my salad days, it would have been easy, but 15 years ago some major back problems popped up and the idea of riding a train so far... is almost diabling in itself. So, the book was a gift to me.<br />Consider this: there are a great many tremendous Christmas (music) albums (largely comprised of the same 20 or so songs); there are maybe 20 excellent Christmas movies. But, how many excellent Christmas books of any kind are there? Dickens, ummmm, Dickens, ummm, Dickens....? Under the right social circumstances, every popular Christmas song ever written/performed could be considered an excess of nostalgic rot. Jokes.<br />No, this book is a gift to the reader who comprehends the standards for a book about humans at the Holidays are very different. Dickens, given an unlikely scenario, could have won two or even three Nobel Prizes for his Christmas novels (the impact that they have had over the years should count) but no one else has come close.<br />Read and enjoy.	2004-01-29

US	52865583	R1OFYCKWUTVZPJ	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Better than Time Travel	I've read this book three times since it was published.<br />As one of the early reviewers suggested, the setup to the time 'travel' process stumbles on itself. Crichton uses the correct terms and suggests a way in which this kind of travel might be possible, but the possibility is virtually nil, so the whole description is difficult to swallow and stalled me.<br />The power of the writing comes after arrival in the 'past' when Crichton gives us - by his writing - a more close view of what life in that period would have been like. Reading about the past or future is probably as close as humans will ever get to time travel, and in that sense, most books are time travel experiences.<br />No need to be a history major - mine were EE/physics/math/CS from 1972. The trouble with Crichton's presentation of the mechanics of 'time travel' is that the words are there, but the linkages are hopeless, and after surmounting this obstacle the first time, I just wanted to get to the past. Still, it is a benefit to see how convoluted any explanation of time travel can get; Crichton made a valiant attempt.<br />I wish that some of the physicists who offer similarly ludicrous hypotheses would consider using a mirror instead of just tossing it out to the world. Everybody wants to be the next Einstein, but it isn't that simple. In this universe, garbage 'science' is garbage, no matter how much the population will pay to read, hear, or watch it.<br />Crichton is a writer, so we can give him the artistic license, and even find value in the flaws of a presentation. Scientists should be held to a higher standard.	2003-01-02

Fowler clearly got the science of the subject material better than \\"The Man in the Ice\\" (which I bought as soon as it came out.)<br />As an engineer, and student of the development of both the sciences and the technologies, it is often amazing how little purity exists in new developments. Certainly, if one of the large projects - I've been on a few with international media coverage - is analyzed from the inside, it looks VERY different than the media hype or soundbites.<br />Fowler wrote a book so filled with hooks that it will affix itself to anyone with a scintilla of curiosity, but whether she consciously considered this or not, her result was not only the history of one man dying high on a mountain glacier several thousand years ago and how he lived, but the story of how WE live in the same environs NOW, and how institutions of science can be rendered impotent by their own internal dynamics as amplified by the various needs of individual researchers.<br />The Iceman's society was clearly fragmented and very rudimentary. There is no way to know if he even had much of a language, but we who live in the 21st century have benefitted from thousands of years of written history, the development of science, technology, and government/society... and, quite frankly, we almost botched this incredible discovery.<br />It's a wonder that the Iceman wasn't sold to a rendering plant and turned into food pellets for mad cows!<br />I guess if you don't want to know anything about the present state of our world society and why people would even BE in that area now, this would be pretty disrupting to you. It would require skimming through many pages of 'inconsequential' information to get what you'd really want: a time travel experience without knowledge of the society that produced the time machine or the technology of the time machine itself.<br />It's rare enough to find a book that GETS the story of a present day development correctly, but one that gets the overall structure of something like Iceman... is... well, almost as rare as the Icemen himself.lopment correctly, but one that gets the overall structure of something like Iceman... is... well, almost as rare as the Icemen himself.	2002-03-11

Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Not Only THE Story of bin Laden, but of Islamic Radicals	This book had essentially been written before September 11 and then was transformed to get more information out by a team of editors over the short time of two weeks.<br />The author has provided us with critical information about the Islamic world and how bin Laden came to Director of Terrorism for a large group of disenfranchised and unhappy Middle Eastern men. Even with ALL the information that has filled the cable system, the print media, the web, and via word of mouth, this book touches all the bases.<br />The author presents the vital information - even the material which inflames most Americans - without a great deal of emotion. He reamins calm when other media pundits and authors are almost certainly reaping the rewards of expressing emotion to feed the sense of national outrage.<br />As someone with an ancient MBA (1979) and a EE/math/physics/CS degree (1972) the presentation of bin Laden's use of businesses was of particular interest. Bin Laden clearly thinks of himself as an economist, hence his expression in one of the videotapes released that the collapse of the WTC caused great damage to the US economy, but this line of thinking is flawed: he appartently has no grasp of how large the US economy is and he REALLY has no grasp of how little the West has had to do with the miserable conditions of Palestinian refugees, and the other millions of impoverished Middle Eastern people connected to Islam. He obviously never read \\"Cities and the Wealth of Nations\\" by Jane Jacobs. Largely what bin Laden has done with his businesses is take money he collects - rather than creates, as do most of the massively wealthy and powerful, including Enron-like corporations - and uses it for reasons of destruction.<br />He also uses the built in fragilities of the Islamic system - the four wives for every rich man allotment, the hunger of children in Pakistan and Afghanistan and other countries - to turn the boys into holy warriors by giving them a purpose in life, a means of avoiding starvation, funding schools that teach nothing about the world, and training the most disaffected to be terrorists.<br />The young men he takes in as ignorant, starving children, full of fear for the subsistence necessities, turns them into holy warriors by giving them shelter and a one dimensional view of life, uses the lack of sexuality under the Muslim system for poor young men... to drive this terrorist frenzy.<br />Bin Laden, with all his millions, was given a life free of want, and yet found his most fullfilling place in the war against the Soviet Union. What this book doesn't state bluntly, but perhaps should: without terrorism and bloodshed, bin Laden's life would be barren. The terror he inflicts and the damage he does are little more than excitement and emtertainment for his own personal satiation. He is said to live a simple live, but in comparison to the poor of the nations that he uses, he is still the \\"Great White (Robed) Hunter\\" manipulating the weak for hsi own personal pleasures, emotional, political, financial, religios.<br />This is the book to read if you want to understand how he operates and what his sorry excuses are for attacking the West in lieu of constructive actions. He's not much of an economist and he's nothing of an engineer. He's wealth and he's adept at using that wealth to manipulate others to cause destruction.

It touched on every aspect of life in that era, using a difficult premise at the focus.<br />One reviewer called it 'sexist.' In that era, women were kept removed from the world, so men were the ones who made the initial contacts with reality and their sexuality. If Lawrence had written about that society in any other way, he would have been inaccurate. Lawrence shows the social conflict with both subtlety and brutality. Yet, Mellor IS a lover. There are sexual descriptions which are explicit, but within the coccoon of emotional bondings.<br />The way that Lawrence has essayed the class structure of England in that era is brave and accurate in all ways. He makes the posturing of the aristocracy both frivilous and full of assinine criteria at the same time he understands the willingness of those in power to offer their lives in the defense of the general welfare.<br />Lawrence notes again with unpleasant accuracy the detriments of an unchecked Industrial Revolution on the social structure of the time. He has Constance both witness these effects and suffer the olfactory damage.<br />This is a literary work which has an effect across the full spectrum of the possible. Finely drawn characters searching for a better way to survive their lives in a scenario that is rife with obstacles and unpleasantness. He has the touch of the finest artist working with the lightest gossamer and the blunt force of an ogre swinging a stone axe.<br />This was published in an abridged version because it was felt that the societal message it conveyed should be allowed to transit the draconian (by the less filtered standards of today) censorship of the era which DID focus on the sexual descriptions but could NOT stop the voice of social criticism any more than the same group could stop Dickens a few decades earlier.	2001-02-23

This book,  over the course of a summer, provided me with the history of mathematical  development at the same time leaving me with the elementals of math areas  in which I had not submerged myself. The effect was a tremendous weaving  together of mathematical knowledge - both the rudiments of theory and  simple examples of applications - which has served me well in the decades  since.<br />There is a great deal of power in the present era from being able  to recognize the appropriate techniques from a more wide knowledge base, at  times, yes, to synthesize two or more techniques to solve a potent problem  or develop an application. Edna Kramers book gave me a great deal, and it  is written in a way that could assist people in all occupations and with  all interests.<br />It is a fascinating and at times awe inspring overview of  math.	2000-08-29

So do all the greats. It is inevitable.<br />I read the original Stump biography in 1962, when I was twelve, before I'd even had the opportunity to steal a base (Little League  rules might as well make this illegal) or given much thought to the mental  aspect of baseball.<br />That book did exactly what Cobb intended: teach  people how baseball should be played, and note his own variations - like  holding the bat with hands separated. He did attempt to whitewash his past  with that book, but the main goal was to present a study of baseball.<br />A  book by Cobb on how to play was important because only he really could  excel at all aspects of the game (pitching aside.) Ted Williams wrote a  great book on the science of hitting, but to my knowledge he stole a base  very few times, and never analyzed fielding with any depth or  effectiveness.<br />I was able to put the information in the original  biography to use the next summer, and found Cobb's ideas and methods (split  grip aside) to be a tremendous resource. I wasn't using the psychotic  attitude but just the techniques and approaches that he had detailed. There  were times when it was simply magic: to take what he had written and use  it! Cobb had noted that on a long fly ball, it is possible to turn your  back and run toward the place where you expect the ball to be... and catch  it over the shoulder rather than looking over the shoulder constantly  (which slows the pursuit) and I did that. He taught how to watch pitchers  and note when they were going to make a move to a base, or simply pitch...  and I used that (let me tell you, there is NOTHING like stealing second and  third against a 15 year old pitcher when you are 13 - and about a foot  shorter.) He taught how to tell what a pitcher was likely to throw my  little mannerisms associated with certain pitches and I used that. He  taught how to bunt, how to analyze the grass length and the gradient of the  third/first base line, how to note the direction a pitcher comes off the  mound to make a bunt more successful, how to hold the bat and make contact.  He talked about how to run around the bases (using the inside of the bases  to shorten the distance AND as a way to plant the foot while making a  turn.) If the timing was right, I could kick a ball out of a baseman's  glove with an ease - due totoally to reading his book - that made it seem  impossible that it was not accidental (deliberate was sometimes considered  illegal, and an out.) That book was simply loaded with data which could be  used to play the game.<br />It gave me such a massive advantage while playing  the game of baseball, I decided that books could be massively advantageous  as a tool to learn about other fields as well. That book was the first  connection I'd had between thinking about something - without a human  teacher, or coach, or mentor - and applying those thoughts, at least in a  direct way. Useful, applicable information existed in books AND you could  progress at your own speed, rather than waiting for everyone in a class or  on a team to catch up. It was a stunning revelation for someone of my  age.<br />In fact, in the late Fifties to mid-Sixties, my childhood, I did a  lot of reading related to sports. The sports bios in those days were much  more dense with sports information and stated very little about how much  money a player made or how much sex they had or how well known they were.  The focus was on the game, which is where boys - who were expected to be  athletes by that society - wanted it. Our athletic heroes motivated us with  their excellence on the field, not with extraneous garbage. In the process  of reading about them and their sports, we became better readers and more  thoughtful people.<br />Still, I must admit, when I crushed a pitch thrown by  a very fast pitcher - this was at age 15 - which looked the size of a golf  ball, seemed to be moving around, and was HISSING at me...the feeling of  power as it launched from my bat was enormous, just unbelievable. It was  moving away from my bat like it had been launched by NASA.<br />Unfortunately,  age 15 was the year my baseball 'career' ended because my high school had  no baseball team (although I would make that a part of my platform when I  ran for student body president; a team was created two years later) and  there was no other outlet for high school ball players in my area.<br />The  movie (based on this book) was not much of a shock to me. This book is well  written, but without the original bio, you miss what truly made Ty Cobb the  great baseball player: his brain. His motives might have been locked in the  horror of his mother (or her 'lover') killing his father, or some weird  desire to excel in a field which was radically far afield from those of his  relatives, and it may have been fueled by all the twisted Southern hatreds  that have filled plays and novels for the last 150 years... but it didn't  affect his ability to play the game or to analyze it  logically.<br />&quot;Cobb&quot; without the original is &quot;insufficient  data.&quot; The original bio accomplished its goals more than Cobb himself  would ever know, and I think this book (and the movie) accomplished its  goals as well. This book does for Stump what he felt guilty about for  thirty years; he needn't have bothered. He, too, accomplished more than he  could have known.. the feeling of  power as it launched from my bat was enormous, just unbelievable.

Flynn clearly has an overarching  expertise in many of the related specializations, and knows how to convey  that information to the reader, blended perfectly with the thrust of the  novel.<br />This is not a linear work of fiction. It's not a comic book.<br />Try  comparing Flynn's &quot;Blind&quot; with Gibson's &quot;Difference  Engine&quot; and you will quickly realize why this book is so difficult to  find. Flynn makes Gibson (who is an excellent writer) look spavined and  directionless.<br />Of course, the inability to find the book could easily be  taken as an extension of the ideas presented. I'll take the less  machiavellian view that present day editors and readers are too weak to  handle this material at this level of complexity, BUT, that the people who  own a copy NEVER will part with it.<br />On the other hand, it may not be in  print for the same general reason that Harlan Ellison's &quot;The Glass  Teat&quot; was pulled from bookstores in 1970.	1999-08-29

Both &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; were exceptional because the text managed to combine  images of violence - eye popping at that - with brilliant elucidations of  the mental processes at work AND birth the character of Hannibal (as well  as that of Starling.)<br />So many other writers have tried with uneven  success to follow Harris' approach, and so many films have used the serial  killer theme, that the whole genre was exhausted. There seemed to be  nothing left to say on the topic.<br />The mine of the serial killer themed  books and films was so completely exhausted that simply knowing a work of  popular art contained this topic caused me to avoid it.<br />Which is part of  the reason I found &quot;Hannibal&quot; to be such a triumph. Harris was  almost certainly using either opera or symphonic arrangements when he wrote  this book. He went deeply into the title character and the Starling  character to create a work of fiction which is (amazingly) fresh and  innovative.<br />&quot;Hannibal&quot; will be considered the masterpiece of  his few novels, and there is not the slightest doubt that both Hopkins and  Foster will reprise their roles in a film version.<br />The conclusion, which  has been criticized by many readers, was completely believable. You give a  psychiatrist access to as much knowledge and psychoactive drugs as Hannibal  had, coupled to the level of intelligence he presented, and the result was  almost inevitable... if he wanted it. And THAT kept me in suspence for even  the last dozen pages.	1999-07-15

The lack of these women - as opposed to the vast majority of women who offer only scorn or rejection - makes men rigid.<br />Po handled that issue perfectly; he handled the crass manipulation by management perfectly; he handled the thin societies of ivory towers perfectly; he caught the sense of the elevated intellect perfectly; he caught the haphazard (and too often contact driven) way that events transpire!  in the Valley; his commentary on the destructive invasion of the lawyers into the creative aspects of technology was exactly on target.
