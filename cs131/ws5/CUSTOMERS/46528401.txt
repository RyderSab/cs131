She and her sister Diana are very different people, and she wants nothing more than for someone to be able to tell them apart. Unlike her sister, Deborah wants to marry for love, and hopes to find a good-hearted man in her short list of prospects. <br /> <br />Michael Winslow, Duke of Fairfax, is also hoping to find a wife... but not just any wife. He's not going to let his grandmother pick his bride. Michael wants a girl to like him for HIM, not simply because he's a duke. He can't think of a better woman than Deborah Woodhurst. Now, if only he'll be able to tell her apart from her twin sister... <br /> <br />There were things I liked about this novel, but there were also things I didn't like. So I'll break it down into \\"The Good\\" and \\"The Bad.\\" <br /> <br />The Good: As always, Susannah Carleton has a good feel for the Regency period. And she's also very good at characterizations. I liked Michael a lot. It was refreshing to have a beta hero instead of an alpha male. Michael is an average-looking fellow without a lot of experience with women. I get tired of the \\"grab and kiss\\" rakish types. Also, Diana Woodhurst was an interesting character. Her snobbishness was amusing. I liked the \\"good twin, bad twin\\" aspect of the book. <br /> <br />The Bad?: Susannah Carleton doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. Where's the peril? Where's the conflict? If you tire easily, the slow pacing isn't for you. Also, you can always count on Susannah Carleton to set aside an entire chapter for her heroine's exploits to the dressmaker. (That's not a good thing) And... who really wants to read about the upholstries and wall hangings and furnishings all the time? <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Twin Peril\\" is a nice story that paints a very realistic portrait of the time period. If you've liked Carleton's previous novels, you'll also like this.	2005-08-24

Nevertheless, her mama sees one last chance to marry her off. Her mama's bachelor-of-choice, Rodney Gilbert, was unpleasant when Cassie knew him as a child. She can't imagine he's changed. Cassie is content with her life as a country lass, making friends with all the neighborhood dogs. <br /> <br />That is... until she meets Geoffrey Dorton, the new steward of a local lord. Mr. Dorton is handsome and charming, and his kisses are unlike anything she ever imagined.  <br /> <br />But Geoffrey has a secret. He's not Geoffrey Dorton, he's actually Geoffrey Dorrington, Earl of Cheriton. And Cassie, as much as he likes her, is just a vicar's daughter. She's no match for a future duke. <br /> <br />I enjoyed \\"Just Say Yes\\" very much. It was charming & fun, and the dog scenes reminded me of something out of a Barbara Metzger book. It did get a bit slow at times (especially after a certain dog plot comes into play), but it's still a solid 4 stars. You've got to love a heroine with a name like Caspar Whittley Maria Hartwell!	2005-08-17

She has no time for herself, and she wouldn't have it any other way. When a partnership at her law firm is within her grasp, Samantha makes a HUGE mistake that could cost her her job. Panicked, Samantha flees London. She hops on a train with no destination in mind, not knowing what to expect.    Samantha ends up at a fancy home in the Cotswolds, and the owners mistakingly think she's the new housekeeper-for-hire. What's a girl to do? She can't very well go back to London, now that her life's a mess. So, she pretends to be a Cordon Bleu chef... even though she knows nothing about cooking. Samantha doesn't even know how to do her own laundry! But her new employers buy into her story... even though the handsome gardener, Nathaniel, is a skeptic.    \\"Undomestic Goddess,\\" is my first Kinsella book, and it hope it won't be my last. It's as perfect as chic lit can get. It's sweet, but not saccharine. It's funny, and it even brought a tear to my eye. A lesser author might've made Samantha seem like like a chronic liar who's completely out of her mind. But Kinsella makes her sympathetic. And Nathaniel (who I thought was a bit dispassionate at first--I was so wrong!) is everything a hero should be. Sure, the book's a bit far-fetched. But if you're reading chic lit, the last thing you want is a dose of reality.     I highly recommend this book!	2005-08-08

When Nick receives an invitation to join \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" for dinner, he thinks it's a joke. What else could it be, if not one of his co-workers pulling a prank? Interested, he decides to check it out.  <br /> <br />Needless to say, when he finally meets \\"Jesus,\\" Nick is skeptical. When they launch into a discussion about Christianity and the validity of religion, he slowly opens himself to the possibility: could he really be dining with Jesus? <br /> <br />\\"Dinner with a Perfect Stranger\\" is a very short, thought-provoking story. It's definitely worth your time, since it probably wouldn't take long to read it (it's just 100 pages). I thought it was interesting, though not entertaining. It's like \\"Twelve Angry Men\\" with a religious twist--there's one scene, one argument, and that's all you get. If you're looking to be entertained, you should probably look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Also, non-Christians might cringe when \\"Jesus\\" starts trying to disprove other religions. It even made me a little uneasy. This book won't turn an agnostic into a believer, nor does it make any new revelations. But it won't bore you, either.	2005-07-31

His servants took the silent girl under their wing, and shortly after, Damon went rushing off to war. Duty called. <br /> <br />Six years later, he returns a changed man. His mother's companion is an angelic girl of 18... who he barely remembers from the night his servants took her in. Katy is mute, and her background is a mystery. Even though he knows nothing about her, and she is likely a lowborn female, he finds himself drawn to her.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, there are three things that make a good book: good writing, a good premise, and good storytelling. \\"Lady Silence\\" has the first two, but lacks the latter. The book starts interestingly enough, but loses momentum quickly. By the middle of the book, I was forcing myself to continue, if only to unlock the truth about Katy's identity.  <br /> <br />Still, I'd have to say this is the most interesting of Blair Bancroft's novels. She's my no means my favorite Regency author, but she's not my least favorite either. She's middle of the road--a solid three stars.	2005-07-28

She doesn't need a man to define her. When her friends sign her up for an internet dating site, she rejects the idea at first. <br /> <br />And maybe she would have rejected the idea FOREVER! After several bad dates, will Jessica ever find a man to spend her life with? <br /> <br />I have to admit, I was charmed by the first 80 pages. I liked the witty dialogue, and the endless bad dates were certainly entertaining. It reminded me of \\"Alfie\\" from a woman's perspective. After the first hundred pages or so... it got old. A real love interest doesn't emerge for a VERY long time, and the book is more about Jessica spending time with her friends & family. For a book that touts itself as a romantic comedy, it had very little romance. <br /> <br />Not to mention, Jessica's attitude started to niggle me after awhile. She'd meet a guy for a date, decide he was too short, and ditch him on the spot. When SHE gets dumped, Jessica (hypocrite that she is) criticizes the guy for judging her based on appearance! If I had a dollar for every time she didn't give a guy a chance based on his looks, I would've been really rich by the novel's end.  <br /> <br />In a chic lit novel, you've got to like the characters. In this book, I didn't.	2005-07-13

So when his crew rescues a young American woman, he feels duty-bound to see her to safety. <br /> <br />Young Julianna Adams has been through ordeal after ordeal. Her fiance recently passed away, she is marooned, and her father is missing (and possibly dead). It's no wonder she is drawn to Nicholas and his kind heart. But will he, and everyone else she encounters, think of her as a wild, rustic American?  <br /> <br />I enjoyed Christine Scheel's \\"A Captain's Castaway.\\" Nicholas was a genuinely good, honourable man, and I could empathize with Julianna in many ways. Still, the characters didn't stand out as much as I would have liked. And the main characters seemed to NOT interact more often than they interacted, which made for some slow pacing at times. Still, there's a bit of adventure, a bit of a mystery, and the ending was very nice (if a bit abrupt). All in all, it's a good first attempt by a new Regency author. 3 1/2 stars.	2005-06-26
US	46528401	R3D430PDMTM89	0525948740	864602598	The Innocent	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Interesting thriller, too many branches	Others have done an adequate job of rehashing the plot, so I won't waste your time.<br /><br />I will, however, say that I'm giving my opinion as someone who isn't already a Harlan Coben fan. This is my first Harlan Coben book. I enjoyed parts of it, but most of the time, trudging through the book felt like a task.<br /><br />Coben grabs the reader's attention right away, seizing them at the very first chapter. He ends the first several chapters with little cliffhangers, and it makes you want to go on. And then the story branches. 100 pages later, you don't know any more than you knew when you started.<br /><br />However, if you don't mind a story that digresses from the main plot (again, and again, and again), then you'll probably enjoy this. I did... to an extent.	2005-06-14

Cool and clever, Craig is a sociopath who wants to believe he's in control. As someone who interviews the criminally insane, it's Paul's job to determine whether Craig is insane... or if love made him do crazy things. <br /> <br />During one of their sessions, Craig starts to recite bits of Paul's personal life. He knows the name of Paul's dead son. He knows the name of Paul's emotionally detached wife. When a murder comes into play, Paul realizes he's in for more than he bargained for. Craig is messing with him. <br /> <br />When I picked up this book, I was expecting something different than what I got. I was expecting something frightening, almost paranormal. But I didn't get the thriller I was expecting. Instead, I got a realistic, insightful look into the makings of a psychotic from an author who is well-versed in the subject matter. The dialogue, in particular, was very good. The conversations between Paul and his patient crackle with life. <br /> <br />However, the few thrills it DID have were often interrupted by Paul's first-person philosophizing. When you're in the heat of the moment, trying to track down a stalker, that last thing you want to read is some metaphor about floorboards. Also, I was hoping for one last big twist, or something to tie everything together nicely in the end. To use a metaphor of my own... I was expecting a bouquet, but I got a rose. <br /> <br />Still, the book in undeniably interesting, and Craig is a compelling character. 3 1/2 stars. <br />	2005-05-15

She'd rather spend her time exploring exotic places, not dodging beaux in London. But Harriet has a secret: she's secretly admired Lord Beldon from afar. <br /> <br />Lord Beldon is looking for the perfect wife. She must be beautiful, smart, rich, and a social paragon. Harriet is none of those things. However, they seem to keep running into each other (literally), and he can't seem to get her out of his mind. During their first private outing, Beldon and Harriet have a deliciously scandalous encounter... which prompts him to propose marriage to the woman he hardly knows! <br /> <br />I've been a fan of the shorter Zebra Regencies for several years. The shorter ones always seemed more traditional, if only because of the absence of racy scenes. When I think of a traditional Regency, I think of the kind Jane Austen might have liked: innocent, clever, with manners typified by the era. Respectable women should be respectable women, and lightskirts should be lightskirts. The two should never cross. <br /> <br />However, lines between the longer historicals and shorter \\"Regencies\\" are starting to blur. I'm one reader who happens to prefer the sweeter stories. \\"The Lady is Mine\\" is a bit racier than I expected it to be; therefore, I'd give it two stars. My rather low score is not based on raciness alone. If I WAS someone who enjoyed the love scenes, I'd still give it 3 stars (at the most). The monotony plays a major factor as well. <br /> <br />On a more positive note: I love the cover.	2005-05-05

She's on trial for murder, and she's obviously guilty... or is she? These are the tantalizing tidbits of information we are given at the beginning of \\"In the Company of Liars.\\" Or should I say, the END of \\"In the Company of Liars.\\"    Initially, I was intrigued by the idea of a murder mystery told in reverse chronological order. Like many others, I loved the movie Memento, and the jacket of this book compares itself to that critically-acclaimed movie. I'm also a fan of Grisham, and the back of the book compares itself to that ultra-famous author.    However, this book falls short. The \\"tantalizing tidbits\\" become a swell of fragmented ideas. It's not as clever as \\"Memento\\"--the journey backward through time gets old very quickly (did we need to know what happened EVERY day??). And the book isn't as engaging as a Grisham novel, either.     \\"In the Company of Liars\\" boasts many fresh ideas, but it's not as unpredictable or fascinating as it would like to be. Overall, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.	2005-05-03

And a secretary is no match for a lady such as herself. <br /> <br />Eventually, his real identity is revealed. And Lydia knows exactly what she wants. <br /> <br />\\"The Winter Duke\\" is a very enjoyable book. Regency readers will like the traditional plot elements and sweetness, despite the lack of action.

Subsequently, she goes into hiding for 8 years. <br /> <br />Since then, Jacinda has been living her life as \\"Jack,\\" a young boy taking hard jobs. These days, Jacinda's not the delicate little flower she used to be. When circumstances land her in the company of Andrew Morrow (now Captain Morrow) once again, she doesn't know whether to accuse him of her father's murder... or fall in love with him. <br /> <br />\\"The Captain\\" is a very enjoyable story. It's full of adventure, especially at the beginning. There's also the murder mystery to solve. Strong and level-headed, Jacinda was a refreshing heroine. I really cared about the characters. <br /> <br />However, when I picked up the book, I was expecting something else. The ship on the cover made me think it was going to be a sweeping epic taking place on a ship. And the back cover boasts \\"still waters, stormy passions,\\" which made me think it was going to be a little spicier than the average Regency, but that's not the case. \\"The Captain\\" is a very chaiste book, with little or no romantic tension for the first two thirds. However, I liked it much, much better for what it was.	2005-04-21

At six and twenty, she has turned down nearly a dozen suitors. She will settle for nothing less than a grand love. <br /> <br />But can she find it in a man like Gideon Sparks? Captain Gideon is down on his luck. Having lost two ships, he is destitute, with no way to return to his homeland. Elizabeth's cousin (and about 4 older lords and ladies, whose names I could never keep straight) concoct a plan. They decide to turn Gideon into one of Elizabeth's suitors. <br /> <br />I've read over 200 Regency romances, and this is the first time I've put a book down. I was half-way through the book, and Gideon and Elizabeth had YET TO MEET. And when they finally DID meet, I didn't care anymore. Gideon fancied himself in love with Elizabeth's portrait, which I thought was pretty shallow. Elizabeth's character was not standout in any way, and a lot of things seemed unrealistic to me, on top of everything else. I put it down on page 108. I love Regency romances, but this one left me cold. Completely. Zebra has changed their book covers; I hope that doesn't mean they've changed their standards as well. <br /> <br />It's a shame, because I've liked some of Julia Parks' past novels. However, she really dropped the ball on this one. I would have much rather read about Elizabeth's friend Penelope and her handicapped brother Roger.	2005-04-14

But is she a suitable match for a lord? <br /> <br />Miss Snow finds herself growing more and more fond of the handsome lord.  He is dashing and attentive, even heroic.  And he seems to show an interest in his neice and newphew.  Or... is it actually Emma he's interested in? <br /> <br />This has to be one of the hardest books I've ever had to write a synopsis for.  Why?  Well, to be honest, not a whole lot happens.  The book itself is like a summer's day: slow and idyllic.  The book didn't have an antagonist, and there was rarely any conflict.  The book's focus was clearly the romance between Emma and William... and even those scenes were scarce. <br /> <br />In my opinion, some of the best scenes revolved around the animals.  There are amorous cats, peacocks, and an attack pig--a regular menagerie.  Even if the book was slow, there were still some enjoyable moments.  Overall, it's a 2 1/2 star read.	2005-03-21

Lucius (or \\"Luce,\\" as he's called) will stop at nothing to win her back, once and for all.<br /><br />The premise of \\"Miss Frazer's Adventure\\" sounded very intriguing, and I've liked Debbie Raleigh's books in the past.  It's an enjoyable book, but while I was reading, I felt like something was missing.  I never got a good sense of the characters.  Something about them was almost... annoying after a period of time.  I was starting to get bored with Lucius' constant swooning over the \\"scent of Kate\\", and with Kate's constant determination to shun him.  I think the book would've been more enjoyable had there been more developement of Lucius' rival beau (Lord Thorpe).<br /><br />Overall, it's still a light, enjoyable book that's very easy to read.  It's not Debbie Raleigh's best, but it's certainly passable.	2005-03-15

The indomitable Lady Olivia may be the answer to his megrims.  <br /> <br />Julia Parks can write a good story, but this wasn't one of my favorites.  There were too many subplots and a few unnecessary characters, and they ultimately detracted from the main plot.  On the other hand, I liked a few of the sub-characters better than the leads... which is usually not a good thing.  Parks starts to balance it all in the end, and it makes for a fairly enjoyable read. It's not a favorite, but it's certainly not bad.	2005-03-03

And Charles is nothing like the man Nell remembers.  He is warm and thoughtful, and her staff falls in love with him.  Can she find love as well? <br /> <br />I really enjoyed \\"The Gilded Knight.\\"  I think it's Donna Simpson's best novel since her debut.  \\"Lord St. Claire's Angel\\" is my favorite book by Donna Simpson, and this one comes close.  The story is very sweet, almost sad sometimes, but definitely touching.  You learn to love the characters, and I think the ending is one of the best I've come across in a long time. <br /> <br />If I had one problem with the book, it would be that it hung around in one place for too long.  The setting didn't change, the activities hardly changed.  But the characters and their problems are so absorbing, you hardly notice. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a sweet, fulfilling love story, look no furthur.	2005-02-27

For the longest time, our hero and heroine show no interest in each other, aside from mutual attraction.  At times, they seem to barely tolerate one another.  If you like that in a book, you'd probably like this.  However, the grueling pace kept me from enjoying it.  And the author seemed to veer away from the main plot more than once.  Toward the end, I felt like I was drudging through it. <br /> <br />On the bright side, the author does a good job at creating her characters, and showing their transitions throughout the book.  Overall: 2 1/2 stars.	2005-02-13

The lady in question is not his fiance.  The good news?  The lady in question is just a woman in a painting.  The lady in the portrait is a vision of loveliness, and has been his muse.  Whether she exists in real life or not, he knows he will never meet her. He decides to commision the painter of the mystery portrait, in hopes that he will catch the essence of his fiance. <br /> <br />The painter, however, is actually a \\"she.\\"  And it was actually a self-portrait.  Which means, of course, he is about to meet the woman of his dreams--in the flesh! <br /> <br />The painter is Cecilia Manners, and painting is her passion.  Intelligent and thoughtful, Cecilia has no idea that Sebastian is in possession of her self-portrait.  And she takes Sebastian's fiance in immediate dislike.  Will mutual attraction lead Cecilia and Sebastian to one another? <br /> <br />The good news?  \\"A Lady of Talent\\" has an interesting storyline, and Evelyn Richardson seems to know the period better than most writers.  The bad news?  \\"A Lady of Talent\\" is very slowly-paced, takes much concentration, and the dialogue is a bit stilted.  When the characters talk to each other, especially when they're talking about themselves, it hardly seems natural.  It almost sounds like they're giving a speech.  My criticism has nothing to do with the period.  I've read countless Regencies that don't sound as stiff as this. <br /> <br />All in all, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.  If you can handle the grueling pace, the story is somewhat enjoyable.	2005-02-04

Ever since her come out, she's been in love with her friend, George Clasby.  But Mr. Clasby is a rake, completely unacceptable for a respectable girl like Harriet.  Her father would not approve, even if Clasby DID think of her as more than a friend.   <br /> <br />George Clasby knows his reputation is less than spotless, but he wants to reform.  To do so, he recruits the help of his friend, Harriet Whitlow.  If the ton sees him in the company of Harriet, perhaps some of her respectability will rub off on him?  Over time, Harriet piques his interest in other ways.  But Clasby doesn't stand a chance, as Harriet's father seems determined to marry his daughter off to a pompous earl named Lord Grafton. <br /> <br />Harriet is determined to win Clasby's heart, and to shake off the attentions of Lord Grafton... even if that means resorting to drastic measures. <br /> <br />I was looking forward to \\"Miss Whitlow's Turn\\", as it has characters from two of Mindel's previous novels, \\"Miranda's Mistake\\" and \\"Kiss of a Highwayman.\\"  I was looking forward to Clasby and Harriet's story, and it does not disappoint.  It's a very enjoyable book, thanks to Jenna Mindel's breezy dialogue and strong storytelling.  Some readers might think the book's pacing is slow, but I didn't. <br /> <br />However, there were a few incidents that didn't really settle well with me.  Harriet, a supposed \\"paragon of virtue\\", puts herself in scandalous situations SEVERAL times throughout the book, and Mindel didn't even acknowlege all of them.  I might be nitpicking, but I don't think it was acceptable behavior for a girl in the Regency period to slip off to a bachelor's town house.  Harriet is a compelling character, but I think the reader was supposed to believe she was virtuous, but we're shown something entirely different. <br /> <br />All in all, I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a light, entertaining book.  If you enjoy this, and you haven't read them, you should certainly read Mindel's other books.  My personal favorite was \\"Kiss of the Highwayman.\\"	2005-01-31

Jerome doesn't really know what to do with his 18-year-old sister Willa.  Even if he DID have money to give her a season, her spectacles and red hair aren't exactly in fashion.  When her long-time friend, Sir Daniel, asks her to marry him, Willa almost wants to accept.  But first, she wants to see if he can stimulate any feelings of excitement in her.  She decides to ask him for a kiss! <br /> <br />When she spots Sir Daniel from afar in the garden, she should not have removed her spectacles so soon.  The man she asks to kiss her is actually his younger brother, Alex.  And he kisses her.  Again.  And again.  After experiencing kisses so nice, Willa has second thoughts about marrying Daniel.  And she won't have to, for her aunt asks her to come to London to be her new companion. <br /> <br />I've read some of the best Regencies, and this book is not among them.  The beginning starts off incredibly well.  Willa's first encounter with Alex is hilarious, and their second and third encounters are promising as well.  The book begins a slow descent into boredom (and the characters lose some of their original wit) around the time Willa goes to London.  When their \\"friends\\" enter the picture, it becomes a bit jumbled (I would have rather had more focus on Alex and Willa), and the book solidified its fall from my good graces when I was met with 2 chapters about birthing a foal.  Despite its excellent beginning, it quickly lost its steam. <br /> <br />However, Willa and Alex were interesting enough characters to keep me going.  I've read better, but I've read worse.  2 1/2 stars. <br /> <br />	2005-01-17

With a nickname like \\"Mistress Reform\\", how could she be anything but a spinster do-gooder?  Currently, she invests her time in rescueing less-than-fortunate Irish girls from dire fates.  Her current protege is a girl named Deirdre, who was a terrible habit of running away.      While searching for Deirdre, Verity has a chance encounter with the dastardly Earl of Brathmere, who is as much of a rake as Verity is a saint.  When they part, she doesn't even give him her name.  But the rakish earl is intrigued, and is determined to find her again.    This is a very intersting book, much different from the regular Regency fair.  It has an altogether different style and flair that cannot be explained until you read it yourself.  (I loved the chapter titles).  This book seems to have everything.  Adventure.  Humor.  Duels.  Rescues.  Damsels in Distress.  Villains.  However, the love story of Verity and Alaric (the earl) left something to be desired.  Unlike most heroes, Alaric really IS a rake.  This behavior is somewhat off-putting, but you can't help but admire a guy who is admittedly worst than most.  However, the story of their romance didn't do much for me.  And I didn't care for the ending.    In fact, I much preferred the secondary romance of the Rafe the footman and Deirdre the maid.  Early on, however, it took an unfortunate backseat to Verity and Alaric's story.    This book is still highly recommended by me, especially for someone looking for a book that's charmingly fresh and different.	2004-12-23

She is rescued by a mysterious laborer, who disappears before she even has a chance to thank him.  Though four-and-twenty, Allyson is not without suitors.  Certainly, her eye has no reason to stray to the handsome new footman... <br /> <br />After his daughter's frightful encounter, Allyson's father summons Captain Nathan Thornton (who happens to be the \\"mysterious laborer\\").  The earl has a special proposition for Nathan.  He is to assume the role of a footman, and try to sniff out the villain in their midst. <br /> <br />The biggest problem this book suffers from is the fact that it isn't sure what it wants to be.  When Allyson has conversations with a child ghost (yes, GHOST) by the name of Maryvictoria, I was intrigued, but I didn't know where it fit into the plot.  The story of Allyson and Nathan might have been sweet, had it not been interrupted by a mess of other plotlines.  The ghost.  The attempts at mystery and intrigue.  The book had its moments, especially toward the end (for me, it held no interest until about chapter 10).  Overall, though, it ended up being piecemeal--the elements of the story never seemed to fit together.   <br /> <br />Overall, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.  It's not bad, just forgettable.	2004-12-19

In \\"Father Christmas,\\" the Duke of Ware needs an heir.  However, he has been married twice, and he has no desire to find wife number three.  At his worst, he decides to appeal to his cousin's widow.  Ware wants to raise one of her twin boys as his own... but not if she has anything to say about it!  Graceanne cannot believe the duke's insolence, and she gives him quite a reprimand.  As she gets to know him, she realizes he might not be so awful as she originally thought. <br /> <br />I didn't really care for the book, which is a shame, because I am a big Metzger fan.  It was lacking the sort of wit Barbara Metzger has perfected over the years.  Actually, I didn't care for Ware.  He was either rude or bland--or both.  Not to mention, the pacing was a bit tedious.  2 1/2 stars.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed the second book, \\"Christmas Wishes\\" a bit more.  When the rakish Lord St. Cloud runs into Juneclaire, he has been robbed by highwaymen, and she is running away from home.  They travel together to London, and he finds himself attracted to the young girl... though he would never seduce an innocent.  When they spend a night in the stables together, he wants to do what is right by the girl... but she flees.  St. Cloud is determined to find her. <br /> <br />This is a 3-star book, a little less refined (you are NOT on the shelf at 19!) than \\"Father Christmas,\\" but a little more interesting.  One of my biggest pet peeves in romance novels is when the hero and heroine don't interact for a large portion of the book.  That happens here.  I thought Juneclaire and St. Cloud were using pet names WAY too soon--which, in the Regency time period, would have been outrageous.  And it's never a good sign when the pig is your favorite character. <br /> <br />Still, the books are pleasant enough.  They hardly deal with Christmas, though, as Christmas is just a side note in each book.  However, I'm still a very big Metzger fan, especially of her recent work.  I really liked her story in \\"Regency Christmas Magic.\\"  Metzger is a pro at light and witty, like she is in \\"Primrose Path\\" and \\"Snowdrops and Scandalbroth.\\"  If those two novels were paired for a re-release, I would do cartwheels for it.	2004-12-06

Two years ago, when Philip Lyonbridge attempted to elope with his brother's fiance, his brother gave him quite a talking to.  Thereafter, Philip decided to join the army and become the man he always wanted to be.  In doing so, however, he leaves behind the love of his life. <br /> <br />At the start of the novel, everyone belives Philip Lyonbridge is dead, including Isabella, who has been harboring a huge secret.  Just two years ago, Isabella Grimsby was a silly girl who would indulge in her every whim.  However, raising her \\"sister's\\" child has matured her quite a bit.  When Philip Lyonbrige is in fact NOT dead, she cannot muster any excitment for him.  In fact, she hadn't hoped to see him at all, after the way he left her.  Will time heal her wounds? <br /> <br />\\"A Hero's Homecoming\\" is a sequel to Kate Huntington's \\"A General's Daughter\\", which was a vastly more entertaining read.  In fact, I would STRONGLY recommend that anyone embarking on \\"A Hero's Homecoming\\" should read \\"General's Daughter\\" first.  Having read its predeccesor will greatly effect your enjoyment of the sequel.  The background on the characters is pretty essential. <br /> <br />That said, I was really disappointed by \\"A Hero's Homecoming.\\" First of all, it was too long.  How the author managed to stretch such a simple story into 280 pages, I still have no idea.  It took me a long time to read it, because I could only read it in small increments.  Also, there were times when I thought the book was too modern in its views.   <br /> <br />I will have to agree with the other reviewers, however.  The most distracting element was two-year-old Jamie.  Had any REAL two-year-old spoken like this child, it would be a prodigy and a genius.  Every time the child opened its mouth, I wanted to hold my breath.   <br /> <br />Overall, I give the novel 2 1/2 stars, borderlining on 2.  I feel terrible for having to give such a low score to an author I generally enjoy, but I have to be honest.	2004-11-28

During her travels, she meets a handsome stranger who cryptically warns her of strange goings-on in her employer's home. Even if governesses WEREN'T disappearing at Tregallion House, she would have enough to contend with, including a bratty charge, a stern mistress, and a handsy Sir Kenneth. <br /> <br />Grenville Martyn tried to warn Sara of the seedy business going on at her new employer's abode.  For some odd reason (maybe the fact that he has a past history with the master of Tregallion?) he deigns to keep an eye on her. Even more odd, he finds himself attracted to the prim little governess... <br /> <br />It's almost impossible to describe the plot without revealing anything crucial. A hint of mystery is always looming.  There were a lot of things I liked about the book, and a lot of things I didn't.  I never truly felt like I got to know Gren's character, and what I did know of him, I didn't always like. The book seemed the drag in parts, and was a bit melodramatic.  However, I did enjoy the mystery aspects. And I enjoyed the unexpected secondary romance, even though it wasn't key to the plot.  Plus, it was refreshing to have a hero who wasn't a rich, titled gentleman. <br /> <br />With Nancy Butler, you really can't go wrong.  She'll always be one of my favorite Regency writers, even if she hasn't been up to her usual standards.  I enjoyed \\"Kindness of a Rogue\\", but it's not one of her best.	2004-11-21

He decides to find a wife--but it can't be just anyone.  He wants someone beautiful and exciting, someone who will stimulate him intellectually and passionately.  Does such a paragon exist?  Maybe there is more to shy Sarah than meets the eye? <br /> <br />When I started to read \\"A Rake's Redemption\\", there were several young people dancing at a ball.  It was an intriguing, humorous beginning, and I thought an intricate love tangle would emerge.  When one of Sarah's other suitors (appropriately nicknamed \\"Nasty Ned\\") came into the picture, I was even more intrigued.  Somewhere before the middle of the novel, the book suddenly lost its steam.  The intriguing secondary characters disappeared.  Nasty Ned didn't come around for at least 100 pages.  Theo fell in love too quickly, and the plot got pretty stagnant.  I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never really did.   <br /> <br />All in all, \\"A Rake's Redemption\\" is a dull novel by a good writer.  Given a good premise, Ms. Carleton can work magic.  This is not one of her best.  It's average at best.  I was just hoping for something better.  After all, the back of the book boasts, \\"Can He Be Tamed?\\" (referring to Theo being a rake)  Why, yes he can!  ...After the first 20 pages.	2004-11-15

And this collection, like others of its kind, does not disappoint. <br /> <br />The first story, \\"Upon a Midnight Clear\\", is a follow-up to one of Amanda McCabe's earlier novels.  The story would be made more rewarding if you take the time to read \\"A Loving Spirit.\\"  The short story is about Antoinette, the Jamaican woman who went to England with her friend (who found her love in \\"A Loving Spirit\\"). Antoinette nearly faces the prospect of a lonely Christmas--until fate intervenes and lands her in the company of a scarred ex-soldier who is just as lonely as she is.  4 stars for this one. <br /> <br />\\"The Ultimate Magic\\" by Allison Lane is also a follow-up to a previous novel (\\"Emily's Beaux\\").  In this story, governess Edith Knolton is chaperoning a troublesome young girl.  Edith  hopes to catch the eye of the man who has already caught hers.  I thought there were too many characters in this one, especially in the beginning, and it was difficult to follow--even though I had read \\"Emily's Beaux.\\"  I give it a somewhat disappointing 2 stars. <br /> <br />In Edith Layton's \\"Two Dancing Daughters\\", a penniless ex-soldier is hired to keep an eye on a man's daugthers.  The ex-soldier finds one of the daughters especially intriguing...  The story itself was intriguing, but it didn't seem to have a lot to do with Christmas.  Also, there could have been more interaction between the two leads.  2 1/2 stars. <br /> <br />\\"The Enchanted Earl\\" by Barbara Metzger was my favorite of the bunch.  In the story, a widow seeks out a magician to entertain guests at her Christmas party.  Instead, she conjures REAL wizards and REAL magic... including an odd, old half-mage named Spinrod.  This is exactly kind of story one hopes to read when they pick up something called \\"Regency Christmas Magic.\\"  It was fun, light, atypical, and is riddled with the Barbara Metzger's humor.  Metzger proves to be just as adept at writing fantasy as she as at writing romance.  5 stars. <br /> <br />In \\"The Green Gauze Gown\\" by Sandra Heath, a widow with two sons moves back to England... and reunites with the man she's always loved.  A scheming sister, missing letters, and a green gown are a few of the elements they must face.  I enjoyed this story, particularly the hero, a bespeckled man with a limp.  I give it 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br />I beg to differ with the other reviewer.  I think this book is well worth your while.  Barbara Metzger's story alone makes it worth the price.  If you're looking for pleasant, light reading for the holiday season, look no furthur.	2004-11-10

But as their feelings start to grow, will love triumph? <br /> <br />For the most part, I enjoyed this book.  It's uneventful, but realistic.  It's simple, but pleasant.  It moves along at a steady (sometimes slow) pace that is appropriate for the period.  While I can understand why some readers might get bored, I did enjoy it.  It's nothing special or new, but it is still likeable.	2004-10-12

She will become the sort of woman who would attract Lord Jeremy's attention, make him desire her, and then break his heart.  Of course, things don't turn out quite like she planned... <br /> <br />I give this book 2 1/2 stars for many reasons.  First and foremost, the gruueeeeling pace of the novel kept me from enjoying it.  I suppose a more patient reader might enjoy it, because Ms. Locksy (especially for a new writer) has a pretty good handle on the period.  What else didn't I like? The main characters meet in the first chapters, but they don't see each other again until the book is half-way over!  Even then, they rarely converse.  Too many secondary characters (whose personalities were not fleshed-out) took away from the main storyline.  Also, the author went back and forth between Clara's story and Jeremy's story TOO often, which meant you could be dealing with 2 page breaks on a single page.   <br /> <br />Lastly, I never really liked Clara, because I couldn't understand why she was so vengeful.  I didn't think her actions were warranted.  Her motivations are never fully explained. <br /> <br />Still, this writer shows promise.  With a condensed story and fewer characters, it could have been exceptional. <br />	2004-10-06

It certainly isn't \\"a notch above terrible\\", as the other reviewer suggested.  I liked this story, and I thought it was a major improvement from Maria Greene's previous novels.  Most importantly, I liked the characters.  Ms. Greene's heroines are sometimes annoying, but I really liked Eliza.  She's a good, rational, thoughtful person.  And Leo Hawkins (our hero) was a nice, serious, upstanding fellow.  They're just two regular people whose feelings for each other steadily grow.  <br /> <br />There's adventure and mystery, and plenty of despicable (almost TOO despicable) characters.  It does have a big fault, however.  I think it could've wrapped up more nicely.

You rarely see fantasy woven into a romance novel, so it definitely scores points for originality.  But was it handled well?  Honestly, I think it took itself a bit too seriously.  If you're a cynic or a realist, you might find yourself rolling your eyes a lot (like I did).  But if you're looking for a little magic, look no further.  This might be the book for you.  It had some interesting elements, but I almost feel like it would've made a better short story.  There were several stagnant parts. <br /> <br />Overall: 3 stars.  Possibly 2 1/2.	2004-08-25

Along the way, her borrowed carriage is accosted by highwaymen!  After a slight fracas, one of the highwaymen is wounded--and he's only a fifteen-year-old boy!  Frazzled, Alexandra sets out to find the young highwayman's family.  They are a family of 5 children who recently lost their mother.  Alexandra decides to help the children find the uncle they have never met.    Richard Browning prides himself on his well-ordered lifestyle.  He finally gained control of Greengage Manor, and he has a perfect, proper fiance.  When Alexandra shows up on his doorstep with 5 children, his world is turned upside down.  He doesn't care for children and their rambunctious ways, and his fiance (Miss Wingate) is particularly upset by the presence of his nieces and nephews.  Little does he know, a little bit of disorder might be just what he needs...    The strongest point of this book was the colorful characters.  The author fleshes out even the most minor characters.  Actually, the book was less about the romance and more about the children.  The story focuses a lot on Ned, Clarissa, Isobel, Michael and Jennifer, and their struggle to find a place to call home.  Richard's fiance was delightfully despicable.  Unfortunately, Richard's and Alexandra's characters could have used more work, as could their romance.  I was hoping for more interaction between the two of them.      While the slight on the romance might disappoint some readers, I still thought the book was very charming.  It's rare to find such a sweet, innocent story.  If I could give an award for \\"most improved author\\", I would give it to Mona Gedney; her last book \\"Love Affair for Lizzie,\\" was charming and unpredictable.  However, there were times when \\"Greengage\\" left something to be desired.  All in all, though, I would recommend it.  It's a little like \\"Sound of Music\\" without the music... (...)	2004-08-18

Lord Huntington is on his way home from war with a very nasty leg wound.  He needs to see a doctor, but all he gets is a willful young girl named Charlotte Kittridge, the doctor's daughter.  Charlotte gets the job done, and she surprises him (and helps him) on numerous occasions.  One of those suprises is her age.  He thought she was a mere fifteen, but she's really seven and twenty--a confirmed spinster. <br /> <br />Charlotte, a fan of those romantic novels written by \\"A Lady\\", has no hopes of a romance for herself.  And even though Lord Huntington's station is far above her own, his kisses make her hopeful.  She knows she is no beauty... certainly not to Lord Huntington, who, even with his wounded leg, is seemingly perfect. <br /> <br />But Lord Huntingon has a secret.  He may be the heir to a dukedom, but the poor man cannot read.  Charlotte is determined to teach him.  Willful Miss Kittridge quickly becomes the most fascinating woman of his acquaintance. <br /> <br />Having not read Sophia Nash's last novel, I cannot really compare the two.  She has been hailed as a promising new talent.  Still, I can't say I was blown away.  The main characters were the strongpoint of the novel.  However, I don't expect to remember anything about the secondary characters next week.  Considering this novel has a few \\"racy\\" moments, I thought it was inappropriate (and misleading) to start each chapter with a Jane Austen quote.   <br /> <br />\\"A Passionate Endeavor\\" might be your bag... but not if you're looking for a charming, witty, Austen-esque story.  I bought this book on a recommendation.  Frankly, I was a little disappointed.	2004-08-13

She and her young niece are in France. Unfortunately, they picked a bad time to be there.  Napolean went to war with England, and all English are to be arrested--and that includes herself.  So, she and her niece, Diana, must return to England at once. <br /> <br />Paxten Marsett is also haunted by thoughts of his old fling with Alexandra.  He loved her once, and when their affair ended, she broke his heart.  A wounded man (in more ways than one), Paxten is also fleeing from France... and imagine his surprise when he comes in contact with Alexandra.  His initial reaction is to break her heart like she did his.  But as time wears on, his old flame ignites passion, which may ultimately lead to a second chance at the love they lost. <br /> <br />I was surprised by the extremely positive reviews on this book.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't BAD.  But I've read better, especially from Shannon Donnelly.  I liked how the characters were older, and that they had their flaws.  On the flip side, I couldn't really care about them very much.  A lot of their relationship was very carnal... and it originally began as an extramarital affair.  The book, which fancies itself a sweeping epic, failed to capture me.  There were several times when I thought, \\"please move along.\\"  On the other hand, it managed to hold my interest, even during its lull periods.  I attribute that to Ms. Donnelly's talent. <br /> <br />I don't think, however, that she'll ever be able to match the charm, originality and wit of \\"A Proper Mistress.\\"  That was my favorite Donnelly book.  If you haven't read it, give that one a shot.	2004-08-08

Over the years, Kittie has read his letters to his aunt, and she is intrigued by the very thought of him. She wants to meet the man whose late wife abandoned him. Could he really be so bad? <br />  <br /> The Duke of Alban was hoping for a peaceful visit with his aunt, who he hasn't seen in 3 years. He and a few hanger-on friends travel to Yorkshire. But there are a few things Alban didn't expect. He did not know his aunt's companion was a beautiful widow, and he didn't know his aunt was blind. The duke has never desired a woman like he desires Kittie. Unfortunately, his friend, Lord Orkenay, has also set his sights on her. <br />  <br /> Eventually, someone makes an offer that changes everything... <br />  <br /> &quot;The Duke and Mrs. Douglas&quot; had its good points and bad points. I liked Kittie. She was willful and opinionated, but hardly overbearing. Those expecting a light-hearted Regency should look elsewhere, as this book is somewhat dark, and deals with some very serious issues. I also liked the fact that the characters were at least a decade older than the average romance characters. It was a refreshing change of pace. <br />  <br /> Now, the bad points. I didn't care for the Duke of Alban. I thought he was rude, bold and prying. I don't think his interest in Kittie ever extended beyond physical attraction, and I certainly can't imagine why she liked him. In terms of romance, it was lacking. I thought some of the &quot;secondary&quot; plots were more interesting, though slighted. I was more interested in Kittie's friend's dalliance with a younger man. I would have liked to see more of Alban's saintly friend, Mr. Norton. The central characters often left something to be desired. <br />  <br /> Overall, it's very average. In the past, I've read better from Donna Simpson. The book is somewhat weak, but it does deliver in certain areas. For instance, I was COMPLETELY blindsided by a twist in the end.	2004-08-03

Her uncharitable uncle has not answered her pleas, and she wants a better future for her family. If she marries a rich man, her younger sister will have the opportunity to have a London season. When Viscount Westfall comes to Chesire, she has the notion to get him to marry her... even if that means resorting to desperate measures.  <br />  <br /> So, Judith throws herself in front of the viscount's carriage, martyring herself for the sake of her family. Her plan works. Westfall invites her into his carriage and asks to see her again. <br />  <br /> But there was one thing Judith DIDN'T plan. Another man was with Westfall that day. That man is Peregrine Campion, Westfall's friend and business partner. Peregrine sees through Judith's plan, and they instantly start butting heads. He is a very big hitch in her plan--along with several other little hitches. She keeps coming into contact with Peregrine, who reads her like a book. He gets a glimpse of the real Judith, and she eventually gets a glimpse of Mr. Campion, as a man haunted by his past. <br />  <br /> I enjoyed this book very much. How anyone can give it anything less than 5 stars, I have no idea. It's a very sweet story--the best I've read in a long time. This is Louise Bergin's 2nd book, and I think she's THE best new writer out there. She's very intuitive. The way she fleshes out her characters is masterful, and you want to see them succeed. More than once, &quot;Worthy Opponent&quot; reminded me of a Jane Austen book, not only because of the time period. I've read a million Regencies, and they never put me in the mind of Jane Austen. Louise Bergin's way of storytelling is what moved me. The ending was perfect... I only wish it would have been a bit longer. <br />  <br /> Highly recommended. (And I'm a tough critic)	2004-07-23

On her way to return her mistress's engagement present, she is robbed, drugged, marooned, kidnapped, and maroooned again.  Imagine her humilation when the robber and kidnapper turn out to be the very same man.<br />That man is Gulliver MacGuigan, a man who is more than he seems.  He robbed the Barkin Emeralds from Maggie, and he kidnaps her because he mistakes her for someone else.  He thinks she is Alice Fescue, the fiance of his rival.  And he is determined to think she is Miss Fescue, even as he finds himself growing fascinated with her.  <br />Maggie herself warms up to Gulliver.  He becomes less of a kidnapper and more of a protector.<br />&quot;The Barkin Emeralds&quot; was an interesting book, but it fell into a lot of typical &quot;romance novel&quot; traps.  Can you really admire a man who robs you, kidnaps you, and forces kisses on you?  At times, Gulliver was a bit overbearing and thick-headed.  I would be scared out of my wits.  And how could Gulliver, in retrospect, love a girl who slices his arm?  I just don't buy it.  Not only that, the characters were somewhat archetypal--Maggie being the spirited lady's companion, Gulliver being the brusque sailor-stud.  The book has its high points, but it falls short where it could have succeeded.  <br />It's alright.  I might even go so far as to say its good, but it's never great.  I've read better books by Nancy Butler, the more recent ones being &quot;Discarded Duke&quot; and &quot;Prospero's Daughter.&quot;  If you want something different from a ballroom Regency, and you like kidnapped heroines... you might enjoy this one.  Probably more than I did.	2004-07-13

Miss Sara Whately came from Philadelphia to England with a plan: one that Lord Reath is most definitely not a part of.  When she meets him, he infuriates her.  When she meets him again, he infuriates her.  In fact, all he seems to do is infuriate her... but he also intrigues her.  Her focus, though, is braving London society and getting her hands on a... certain object.<br />Ex-rake Lord Reath (called &quot;Sin&quot; by his friends) has decided to change his ways.  He is determined to right the wrongs in his life... and that includes giving up mistresses and the like.  When he runs into Sara Whately, he is enchanted (and annoyed) by her disinterest in him.  She is a bit uncouth, and has a sharp tongue, but that only makes him want to woo her more.<br />Neither of them realize that Lord Reath may have exactly what she's looking for...<br />This book has a lot of pros and cons.  Had it been the first Regency romance I'd read, I would have enjoyed it immensely.  However, I've read many Regency romances, and this one's a dime a dozen.  It's very archetypal.  The heroine is saucy.  The hero is an ex-rake.  They get into fights.  They go to balls.  They like each other, but they won't admit it.  There's nothing new here.  Still, the beginning and ending were really good.  (The middle was somewhat slow)<br />Most of all, I like the author's unique &quot;out of sequence&quot; style.  She's writing a series based on the love lives of 4 friends, but she's not doing it in chronological order.  Her last book, &quot;Miss Seton's Sonata&quot;, takes place AFTER the events of &quot;Miss Whately.&quot;  Seperately, neither book shines.  Together, they make an interesting pair.	2004-06-28

In the past, he dabbled in the lives of her two best friends.  When she happens upon him in Brighton, he is as handsome as ever... though she wants little to do with him.  <br />Somehow, Penelope becomes embroiled in Verwood's affairs.  Someone is out to kill Lord Verwood--and now Penelope is a target!  But, when one problem is resolved, a much larger problem presents itself.  No longer will Penelope live the quiet life she's always wanted, as the wife of a rector.  A scandal makes her reconsider her options.<br />When I reached the mid-point of the book, I was really enjoying myself.  Good story.  Good characters.  I wanted to see what happened next.  At some point, the book lost momentum.  I found myself thinking &quot;what next?&quot;  And, unfortunately, there was nothing left to hold my interest.<br />The story itself is nothing new.  A reformed rogue.  A marriage of convenience.  I've seen it many times before.  However, Elena Greene's writing is what saves it.  I thought this book was better than her previous novels.  The story was more believable, and her characters were more enjoyable.  <br />Overall, I'd say this book is alright, which is slightly less than good.  I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.	2004-06-09

He travels to Bath with one goal in mind.  He wants to woo and ruin the authoress of the dreaded novel, &quot;A Rogue's Tale.&quot;  That particular book is based on the life of Lord Daventry (with a &quot;D&quot;)  And Lord Daventry's romantic exploits, as it happens, are very similar to his own. He believes the authoress's name is Aurelia Kittling...<br />But Gaventry couldn't be more wrong.  Sarah Kittling is the author of the book, not Aurelia.  Sarah is working on revising a sequel to &quot;A Rogue's Tale&quot; when a stranger comes up and kisses her!!  In plain view!  Imagine her surprise when the amorous stranger is actually Lord Gaventry, the man whose roguish reputation inspired her novel!<br />While Gaventry enjoys flirting with Sarah, it's Aurelia he must focus on.  One misunderstanding leads to more misunderstandings...<br />The summary definitely sounds more complicated than it is.  The book (I'm talking about &quot;A Rogue's Revenge&quot;, not &quot;A Rogue's Tale&quot;) is a lot more stagnant than its synopsis might suggest.  Frankly, I was bored. And I didn't enjoy the characters, especially Lord Gaventry.  I disliked him very much.  He used the &quot;grab-and-kiss&quot; method too many times.  Also, his behavior in the end is nearly unforgiveable.<br />After reading the first chapter, I had a feeling I wouldn't enjoy it.  Gaventry kisses Sarah in public.  Back in Regency times, that would be enough to ruin a girl.  And yet, Sarah keeps coming back for more, and she never seems to suffer any repurcussions for her actions.<br />In short, I wouldn't recommend this one.  Unless you're planning a holiday to Bath, England (which I, conveniently, am), I wouldn't bother with it.	2004-05-27

However, Cordelia receives some unexpected news.  Perry, Elaine's husband, has invited three of his friends to fish on his land.<br />And Cordelia is acquainted with all of them.  They called themselves the &quot;Quorn Quartet&quot;, and they were terrible pranksters.  Five years ago, one of the four friends, Cedric, almost married Cordelia.  However, she secretly harbored feelings for Lord Matthew Allerton, who seemed to be the least obnoxious of the bunch.<br />When Cordelia sees Matthew again, her old infatuation comes rushing back.  As she begins to spend more time with him, she sees there is more to him than tricks and games.  But is it love?<br />Generally, I enjoy Victoria Hinshaw's novels.  They're always pleasant, and they stories are basically good.  However, they fail to move me in any way.  This book is no exception.  I enjoyed it to an extent... but it wasn't as engaging as it could have been.  I expected more, even from Ms. Hinshaw.<br />So, would I recommend it?  Sure!  It's good, but it's not great.  It's nice for a bit of light reading.	2004-05-21

She is looking forward to her time in London, where she anticipates being courted by a nice gentleman.  However, she refuses to marry a man who is after her fortune.  She will only marry for love.<br />...Which is why the Duke of St. Fell is NOT suitable.  He is a rake and a cad, and he says the most ridiculous things!  As soon as he meets her, he says he loves her--and he doesn't deny the fact that he's a fortune hunter!  While she admits she's infatuated with St. Fell, she would never fall in love such a vain, self-important man.  Although he does make things interesting...<br />The plot thickens when Arabella is courted by another suitor, the poetic Lord Stonebridge.<br />There are many things I enjoyed about this book.  St. Fell was one of the funnest heroes in a long time.  Every time he opened his mouth, he lit up the page.  The book crackles with wit, and it's hard to read it without a smile.<br />However, there were a few things that were irksome.  Sometimes, the text seemed like it was all over the place.  The book seems like it could have benefited from a little extra editing, unless the author meant for it to read like a stream of conciousness.  Also, there were several times when I thought, &quot;that doesn't seem 100% realistic.&quot;  It seemed a bit tongue in cheek (but not necessarily in a bad way).  Lastly, the last chapter went on too long.  It didn't seem necessary.<br />Nevertheless, this is one of the cutest, funniest books I've read in a long time.  I do recommend it.	2004-05-14

Matthew is engaged to another woman--a Miss Teresa Blackwell!  Lizzie is determined to show Matthew she is more worldly than he realizes.  She decides to take matters into her own hands.  With a friend, Lizzie travels to Vienna... where Matthew is.<br />The back of the book fails to mention the OTHER man who becomes a large part of Lizzie Lancaster's life.  Daniel Thoreau, an American, becomes her traveling partner and fast friend. <br />I enjoyed this book very much.  Every character lent something special to the story.  I especially enjoy books where the heroine is courted by not one, but two (nearly three, in this book) suitors.  It makes the book less predictable.  &quot;An Affair for Lizzie&quot; was definitely unpredictable--and it was flavored with sweeping intrigue.<br />Unpredictable indeed!  I was stunned by the last two chapters.  Actually, &quot;stunned&quot; isn't the appropriate word.  I felt slighted, devastated and heartbroken.  I wish I could have sat down with the writer for a few minutes to tell her to CHANGE THE ENDING!!!  In my opinion, it was incredibly rushed... and Lizzie wasn't with the right guy (I'm not going to say who I think the &quot;right guy&quot; was.  After reading this book, however, I am sure you will agree with me).  It seemed so obvious to me.  *sigh*  Oh well...<br />Had this book ended in an unhurried, APPROPRIATE way, it would have easily gotten 5 stars from me.  It is interesting the whole way through--and it's better than anything I've read from Mona Gedney thus far.  I would recommend it... though bear in mind you might be disappointed.  Why the author went in the direction she did, I have no idea.	2004-05-02

But if that dilemma isn't bad enough, her brothers send her to live with a family friend... and that's where Jared is staying!<br />When Jared sees Emily, old memories come flooding back.  Yes, he was married before.  Yes, he still loves Emily.  Jared has secrets, many secrets.  None of them will stop him from wooing Emily all over again.<br />Well... hmm.  I feel like I should say at least one good thing about this book.  I enjoyed Teresa McCarthy's attempt at humor, mostly in the from of Lord Fennington (Emily's too-determined suitor, a man with an overlarge quizzing glass!)<br />Unfortunately, there is more to dislike than there was to like.  For starters, it took me 2 weeks to read this book.  Normally, I can read books like this in 2-4 days.  It just wasn't interesting enough to hold me for very long.  The characters were bland.  It was far-fetched at times.  The story didn't really do anything for me, and... I just didn't care for it.  It was stagnant for too long.<br />That said, I would recommend that you steer clear of this one.  It's certainly not the greatest of its genre.  In fact, I'll go so far as to suggest another recent release: &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; by Kate Huntington.  That book is as suprising as it is engaging.	2004-04-29

The prudish schoolmistress has a secret: she's the author of the popular book, &quot;A Lady's Rules.&quot;  The book, now the talk of the ton, is a very strict outline of proper decorum.  And Rosalind desperately needs the book to sell... so she can get her no-good brother out of a pinch.<br />All of Rosalind's problems can be traced back to Lord Morley.  Viscount Morley, a poet and notorious rule-breaker, has been a bad influence on Rosalind's younger brother.  Not to mention, it's LORD MORLEY who is hindering the sales of &quot;A Lady's Rule's!&quot;<br />...But why does she find herself attracted to Lord Morley?  And why does Lord Morley find himself growing fond of a woman who is openly critical of him?<br />&quot;The Rules of Love&quot; is essentially an &quot;opposites attract&quot; book--and it's a very good one.  Rosalind needs Michael (that's Lord Morley's Christian name) to tear down her walls, and Lord Morley needs Rosalind to keep him grounded.  Amanda McCabe does a good job of drawing us into her world and her characters' world.  Another thing I like about Ms. McCabe is the fact that none of her stories are similar.  She brings us something new every time.<br />That said, &quot;Rules of Love&quot; had a few slow moments, and it was generally uneventful.  Still, it's very sweet.  I don't have much to complain about.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, humorous, feel-good book.	2004-04-19

Though Captain Randall has cared for her as his own, Marian Randall has just received the shock of a lifetime... her father is NOT the kindly army surgeon.  Rather, she is the illegitimate daughter of General Grimsby.  Marian, who has spent most of her time caring for wounded men on the Spanish Pennisula, now finds herself shipped off to London to unite with her real father's family.<br />War hero Adam Lyonbridge feels honor-bound to his commanding general.  For that reason, he agrees to escort Marian to her new home.  Though he's intrigued by Marian's strong will &amp; spirit, there's nothing he can do about it.  Adam is engaged to the General's other daughter, Isabella Grimsby.<br />For the life of them, Isabella and Adam cannot get along.  They practically hate each other.  Isabella harbors a secret... one that ultimately alters the course of their lives.<br />On so many levels, this is such a good book.  A few paragraphs to describe it do not do it justice.  I loved Marian's character.  Toward the cataclysmic middle of the book, Marian does something SO selfless, it is impossible not to love her.  Marian's half-sister, Isabella, was something of a surprise.  Though snobby and self-interested, she is also a caring, sentimental person.  Aside from being a story about romantic love, this novel is also about love &amp; acceptance between two new sisters.  <br />As for Adam... at the beginning of the book, he was an overbearing Alpha-male type.  At his worst, he said to Marian, &quot;I could crush your skull between my thumbs.&quot;  Having said that to a lady, I wasn't sure his character would ever be redeemed.  He certainly DOES redeem himself.  Tenfold.<br />I can't say enough about this book.  It's fresh, it's surprising (VERY surprising) and it pulls at your heartstrings.  I give it 4 1/2 stars.  I would love to give it a solid 5-star rating, but the first half of the book was somewhat slow, with the first couple of chapters being awkward and jumbled.  (When Marian learned about her new father, it didn't seem natural).  However, the second half of the novel MORE than makes up for the stunted beginning.  I loved the story. I loved the characters (their emotions were very realistic).  I want to see Isabella, for all her faults, get a happy ending.

Sir Gerard Montfort just inherited his uncle's baronetcy... but NOT his uncle's fortune.  Gerard was in desperate need of that money.  He needed to pay off his gambling debts, as well as debts to a money lender.  Uncle Nigel always thought his nephew a wastrel, so he willed his blunt to a charitable spinster.<br />Annette Courtney is just as surprised when she inherits the old man's fortune.  She's suddenly an heiress--and a very popular woman!  Her sole dream, however, is to start a school for a local children.  Miss Courtney loves children.<br />Needless to say, Miss Courtney's interests are very different from Gerard's.  Gerard will stop at nothing to get back what he believes is rightfully his... even if that means getting the spinster to succumb to his charms.<br />I enjoyed this novel very much.  It was a very sweet book.  More than anything, it was a mature book.  The heroine wasn't a flighty schoolroom miss.  Rather, she was a mature, level-headed, intelligent, kind-hearted person.  I also found myself sympathizing with Gerard.  Despite his actions, he had good intentions.  It was interesting to see their characters develop and grow.<br />In the future, I'll definitely keep my eye out for Louise Bergin.  Her story brightened by darker days... even if it was a bit slow to start.	2004-04-01

While on the road, she reflects on recent rumors: Highwaymen have been plundering carriages along the way, stealing kisses and riches from their lady victims.  Lo and behold, the very same thing happens to Artemis and her step-mother.  A masked Romeo steals a kiss... along with the Rothwell ring.  Artemis is determined to get it back.<br />Artemis' &quot;Romeo&quot; is none other than Brian, Lord Cherrington, who has infiltrated the group of &quot;gentleman&quot; highwaymen in order to get revenge for his brother's death.  When he meets Artemis in town, he instantly recognizes her as the woman of Amazon-stature whose carriage he recently robbed.  In London, Cherrington parades around like a foppish dandy--the very sort of guy that Artemis wants to avoid.  ...But there's more to &quot;Cherry&quot; than she thinks.  Much more.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  Unlike most books, something was always happening.  It was interesting.  It was often exciting.  I just had to laugh when Lord Cherrington kept insisting that she call him &quot;Cherry.&quot;  And Artemis was a refreshing heroine--tall, brave... she was a girl who could take care of herself.  Jenna Mindel brings an interesting new plot to the table.  Unfortunately, it did seem a bit unrealistic at times (i.e. Artemis' aptitude w/swords, and some scandalous actions from both characters).  Overall, though, I enjoyed it very much.<br />Before you read, you might want to check out Jenna Mindel's last book, &quot;Miranda's Mistake&quot;, in which Artemis is a central character.  I was really hoping she would get her own story.  I'm glad she did.  (Now, I can only hope for Clasby...)	2004-03-23

His nickname is the &quot;Black Baron&quot;, and he looks like the hero of her daydreams.  Both Lord Latham and Miss Herbert find solace in a library.  She quickly falls in love with the kind-hearted baron, who hardly lives up to his &quot;black&quot; reputation.<br />Lord Latham is immediately drawn to Tabitha.  She is beautiful and sweet, and he enjoys conversing with her.  Soon, he finds himself seeking her opinion on pretty much everything.  As it happens, though, he is betrothed to Lady Susan (a &quot;widget&quot;).  And Tabitha herself accepts the offer of the squire's son, Sam Ainsworth (a &quot;clod&quot;).  What a mess!<br />I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  As always, Ms. Hendrickson does a superb job of portraying the characters and the time period. Even the secondary characters (i.e. Susan's cousin, Hugh's aunt) lent something to the story.  And what book is complete without a killer swan?  <br />I had one large complaint, though.  The book moved too fast in parts where it could have moved slower, and it moved too slowly in parts that could have been abbreviated.  The beginning and end were unfortunately very short, while the pacing of the middle often creeps.  <br />Still, the likeable characters and sweet, simple story make this a good 3 1/2 star book.  It's a good book for a rainy day.	2004-03-19

And then he finds his salvation: in the form of a beautiful woman.  He spots an angelic woman in a passing carriage, and he vows to meet her and make her his wife.  Through her, he WILL be reformed.<br />The lady in question is Lady Rowena Revington, a spoiled, self-indulging brat.  It is Amy Corbett's job, as Rowena's chaperone, to find a husband for the willful girl.  But Lady Rowena has no desire to marry.  She lives to make every man fall head-over-heels in love with her, Lord Pierson included.  As it happens, sweet Amy is the one who truly has budding feelings for the reforming viscount.<br />I enjoyed this book very much.  Actually, it's better than most of the books I've recently read.  The characters (especially the secondary characters, which includes the charming and crafty Lord Bainsbridge) are engaging, and you really want to know what happens to them.  Romantically, each character ends up with the right person, and the ending is sure to leave a smile on any reader's face.<br />On the flip side, there were certainly times when I wished the book would move a little bit faster.  Also, I thought the characters were a bit superficial at times.<br />Overall, though, it's a really good book.  I enjoy Donna Simpson very much, and I hope she has a story for Lady Harriet (Bainsbridge's bluestocking sister) underway.	2004-03-15

And through those letters, Lord Thomas became intrigued.  In fact, he decided he wanted to marry Melisande Wendham.  <br />When he goes to meet her, however, Lord Thomas must tell her something else.  He is also indirectly responsible for her brother's death.  Needless to say, Melisande gives him a rather icy reception.<br />In meeting Melisande, Lord Thomas is met with another surprise--Peter Wendham had another sister, a half-sister, who is ten times sweeter and just as beautiful as her elder sister.  Caroline Norcrest is her name, and she can't help but feel sympathy for Lord Thomas... and his cause.  Caroline becomes an &quot;ally&quot; in his quest for Melisande's heart.  <br />I really enjoyed this book, especially the beginning.  It had one of the most promising beginnings (the first 80 pages) that I have ever read.  I really enjoyed the characters.  Caroline is as kind as any romance heroine, and Lord Thomas is a gentleman through and through.<br />However, there were a few things that put a damper on the book.  I felt like I was mucking through all of the war stories... and the romance was almost overshadowed by the &quot;mystery&quot; of the artwork.  In fact, it almost seems like &quot;The Mystery of the Artwork&quot; could've been an alternate title for this book--that subplot almost became the central plot.  <br />Still, I enjoyed the characters and their foibles. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. I even found myself feeling pity for characters I don't think I was supposed to like.  Poor Bowes...	2004-03-12

She is also expecting something different in the captain, who she accidently mistakes for a scarred old seaman.<br />But Captain Matthew Frobisher is much, much more than she expected.  She becomes intrigued by Matthew's pirate-like appearance and adventurous spirit.  And it's a big surprise to learn he's a schoolmaster... he's training young men to become spies!<br />Lydia, the daughter of a Russian princess, is also something of a surprise to Matthew.  She is much more willful than he ever expected.  Together (with the young spies-in-training), they embark on a venture beyond their wildest dreams.<br />I was really looking forward to this book, because Nancy Butler is one of my favorite Regency writers.  ...And I stress the word REGENCY.  There is a big difference between a \\"mainstream historical romance\\" and a \\"regency romance.\\"  I have read many books from both genres, and I've come to appreciate the charm and sweetness of a Regency more than I enjoy the escapades and (for lack of a better word) smut of a Historical.  Despite the time period similarity, this book, \\"Castaway Hearts\\" is definitely more like a mainstream historical romance.  I've read a few Signet \\"Super\\" Regencies, and the \\"Super\\" usually refers to the extra 80-or-so pages.  That is not the case with this book.<br />There is also a pointed difference between these characters and the typical charming, society-minded Regency characters. Matthew Frobisher is an often-overbearing Alpha male who intrigues Lydia with his brusque attitude.  Lydia is a former darling of society who COMPLETELY shirks proprieties.  These two fall in love very quickly, and their romance heats up very fast.  In terms of romance, it left something to be desired.<br />I suppose it all amounts to preference.  I prefer Regencies.  This book did not transport me to the Regency world, nor was it enfused with the depthand insight I've come to expect from Nancy Butler.  If I judge it against the mainstream historicals I've read, this book gets 3 1/2 stars.  There were enough fights and rescues to satisfy any adventure fan.  ...Personally, the thing I liked about this book the most were the young spies-in-training.  One, in particular, stole my heart.  If Gilbert Marriot isn't the star of his own story, I will be distraught.	2004-03-08

He reads some random entries, and learns a great deal about the widow's (Lenore is her name) feelings.  Intrigued, he leaves his own entry in the diary--he writes her a rather scathing response.<br />Lenore Andrews is tossing and turning over the thought of her missing diary.  If anyone read its contents, it would be scandalous!  When the diary is returned, and she reads the anonymous man's response, she is outraged.  She writes back and gives him a piece of her mind!  So begins their correspondence...<br />At the same time, Lenore is introduced to a man named &quot;Eric Ramsey,&quot; a man who is both intriguing and infuriating. What she doesn't know (aside from his real name) is the fact that he's a suspect in her brother's murder.<br />I admit, the premise was fairly interesting.  It was different, and I was interested to know what would happen.  However, it was often dull, and undoubtedly overlong.  <br />Perhaps the thing that spoiled it the most (the same is usually true in all of Maria Greene's novels) was the heroine's illogical behavior.  When she lost her diary the first time, she was so worried about getting it back, lest its scandalous contents be broadcast to the public.  ...When the stranger (aka, Eric) writes back, she decides to leave her diary in the tearoom again.  And again.  And AGAIN.  ...How sensible is that?  Not very.  Not to mention, Lenore seemed to have very little regard for her reputation, and she was very rude to Eric--in her responses AND in person.  I didn't know why he liked her.<br />Also, the author spent way too much time talking about Charlie's (he was a mutual friend of Eric and Lenore) infatuation with a icy twit. It had absolutely nothing to do with the plot.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book.  I've read many books that are much, much better.  This one is barely worthy of two stars.	2004-03-05

To do so, Audrinna needs to find a husband for her cousin--and she sets her sights on Lord Blanford.  But Lord Blanford has other plans...  This was my favorite story of the 3, and it was the sweetest.  Lord Blanford's struggle with baldness was a charming focal point of the story, and you just had to love his hairpiece.  I give it 4 stars.<br />In &quot;Last Valentine,&quot; faux widow Martine finds herself getting a Valentine every day of the week.  She just KNOWS they're coming from her ex-lover, the man who abandoned her several years ago.  But... was she right to assume they are coming from him?  ...This story was odd.  It was an interesting concept, but it was just too short.  The characters were silly.  The whole story seemed kind of pointless, actually.  I wish Ms. Metzger would have elaborated more on a good idea.  2 stars for this one.<br />&quot;In Love and Tenderness&quot;, newlywed Senta has just made a muck of her wedding night with Lord Maitland.  But it's not her fault.  She was frightened by a ghost, who, unfortunately, has lost his memory!  Now Senta and Lord Maitland must reunite, and the &quot;ghost&quot; is there to help them.  Also, Lord Maitland must solve the mystery of his brother's death.  This is the longest story of the 3--it's more like a novella.  By far, the ghost is the star of the story.  It's not hard to figure out the identity of the ghost... but when you do, it's a riot!  I liked this story, but it would have been even better had there been more of the ghost, less of the &quot;mystery&quot;, and more interaction between Senta and Lord Maitland.  I give it 3 stars.<br />This compilation also includes a reissue by Margaret Evans Porter.  I read &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; over a year ago, so I don't feel confident enough to review it at length.  The book is about a man fleeing from a duel.  On the road, he meets a pretty young lady--and they take part in a scandalous arrangement.  &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; is a much darker counterpart to the light-hearted Metzger stories, which makes me wonder why they were tacked together.  If I recall, Porter's novel was good, but slow.  <br />Overall, it's an interesting assortment--definitely worth looking into.	2004-02-28

Anthony Norville, Viscount Frayne, is everything Caroline wants to avoid.  In an attempt to put their first scandalous meeting behind them, Anthony and Caroline spend more time together, and their attraction slowly builds.<br />In my opinion, however, the real &quot;stars&quot; of the story are Marcus (Caroline's father) and Jen (Marcus' new wife).  What starts as a marriage of convenience becomes more than they expected.  As a whole, I really enjoyed their story.<br />Still, I felt like this novel was lacking something.  The pacing, especially at the beginning, was excruiatingly slow.  I had to MAKE myself read.  However, it did get better over time.  I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.	2004-02-22

Brothers Max and Tristram Darby are facing a huge dilemma: unless they marry heiresses, their father could wind up in debtor's prison.  Both brothers journey to London in hopes of finding a rich bride.  <br />However, Max is also facing a smaller dilemma.  He just lost his racehorse, Thunderlight, to an Irish horse breeder (who happens to be his next door neighbor!)  Then he meets the neighbor's daughter, Kate O'Connor, who is penniless but carefree. As they spend more time together, his affections for her start to build.  Unfortunately, there's the prospect of marrying a rich girl always dangling over his head.  <br />Tristram Darby, Max's brother, is also a central character of the book.  He's the focus of a lukewarm secondary romance, which left me pretty disappointed.  Even in Ms. Parks' previous novel (&quot;To Marry an Heiress&quot;), romantical Tristram was my favorite brother.  In my opinion, he got slighted.<br />In the end, the brothers' behavior started to niggle me.  For the longest time, Max insists on marrying an heiress, despite his feelings for Kate.  Tristram's willingness to &quot;step aside&quot; was unnerving (I can't say any more than that--I don't want to spoil it for you).  The beginning of the novel was so unique and engaging, I was really hoping for something better.  Especially for Tristram.<br />I would recommend it, though, especially if you've read &quot;To Marry an Heiress&quot;, a book about the first Darby brother's search for a wife.	2004-02-14

Alexander wants to decline, but a debt of honor changes his mind.<br />Juliet Moseby has been in love with Alexander since she was a little girl, when he saved her from a neighborhood bully.  Her heart has always been his.  However, she is just somebody's natural daughter; she doesn't even know who her father is.  Because she is in love with Alex, she has always been able to tell one twin from the other.  When Alex claims to be Tony, she sees through the scheme in an instant.<br />For the most part, I enjoyed the book--especially the last third.  The beginning and middle were a bit slow.  The subplot that deals with Juliet finding her father is very interesting, although I saw the &quot;twist&quot; coming from a mile away.  I also enjoyed the ending very much.<br />However, the book seemed to lack something.  I can't put my finger on it, though.  I think Ms. Kirkland could've spent more time developing the romance.  The reader has to assume the characters are in love, rather than see any progression of a relationship.  Also, I don't feel like we got to know Alex well enough, nor do I think he can be called a &quot;perfect scoundrel.&quot;  He wasn't really a scoundrel.  He was a nice guy who stole a few kisses and pulled a few childhood pranks (mostly because of his brother).  <br />Overall, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.  After reading Kirkland's &quot;An Inconvenient Heir&quot; (which was a phenomenal book), I've come to expect more from her.	2004-02-08

And Olivia Henshaw (aka, Venus) is vexed by George's company.<br />I loved this book.  The characters were well-crafted, the dialogue was great, and the story was touching.  The book captured my heart.  For the first time in a long time, I was very eager to return to the book after I'd put it down.  The story's theme seemed to center around &quot;taking risks.&quot;  In a sense, Elizabeth Mansfield took a great risk... you hardly ever see a romance, especially a Regency romance, about an older woman with a younger beau. What a refreshing change! <br />If anything bothered me about the book (and it's a stretch) it would be the fact that Olivia often seemed over-critical of our well-meaning hero.  <br />There was also a great secondary romance woven into the book.  The secondary romance, about George's crippled friend, was just as compelling as the primary.   <br />I would highly recommend this book.  It was never dull, and I was absorbed by every word.	2004-01-01

She is also wary of Lucas (Lord Worthington to her) because of his tarnished reputation.  Penelope was the one who discovered the dead body of the previous Lord Worthington.  <br />Of course, the story is much more in-depth than this.  In fact, the &quot;mystery&quot; plot was rather entertaining.  As a mystery, I'd give it 3 stars.  There were plenty of twists, and Glenda Garland managed to bring some new things to the table.  However, I thought the book was overloaded with characters.  There were a few dialogue sessions where I thought I was reading a watered-down screenplay of Gosford Park.  I lost interest a few times, and I had to re-read a few things.<br />As a romance, this book falls short.  There is little-to-no chemistry between the characters.  Their dialogue has minimal spark.  They had forged a solid friendship, but I don't know if it went much further than that.<br />If you like mysteries, you might want to pick this up.  However... I wouldn't really recommend it to someone who was looking for a good romance.  Overall, 2 1/2 stars.	2003-12-26

Even now, she continues to vex him.<br />But poor Marcus is blind to his true feelings.<br />I really enjoyed this story.  It was a bit slow-moving at first, but overall, the pacing was pleasantly relaxed.  Mona Prevel breathes new life into an old concept, giving us a book that is touching, funny &amp; sweet.  I smiled several times, and even had a tear in my eye.  Unfortunately, the ending was very abrupt.  After enjoying the rest of the story so much, I was anticipating an emotional undoing at the novel's end.  But it was resolved in a page and a half.<br />But it's definitely a good book.

A jealous husband challenges him to a duel... and then winds up dead.  Terrance, now a suspect in a murder case, ends up gravely wounded--and it's Sylvain who tends to him.<br />I was really looking forward to this book, mainly because of sweet Sylvain.  She was always an intriguing secondary character in Donnelly's last novels (and I would recommend both of those).  However, I was a bit disappointed.  I didn't think Sylvain and Terrance interacted enough; therefore, their romance came across as a bit tepid.  Also, their romance was overshadowed by the &quot;murder&quot; plot, which I didn't think was overly intriguing.  <br />But it was still enjoyable, and I'm glad I read it.

However, I often thought the book was verrrry slowly paced, especially at the beginning. Also, I think I would've benefited from reading the author's previous novels (His Heart's Delight &amp; His Last Lover).  &quot;Pleasure of His Company&quot; is filled with characters from those books.<br />Still, this book is enjoyable, and I really felt like I could empathize with the characters.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars.	2003-12-01

But she has since moved on with her life, and spends her time running a school for the non-gentry.  Now, she's got another responsibility on the horizon.  She is to guide her silly young cousin, Priscilla, though her Season.  <br />As luck would have it, Eleanor almost immediately runs into the man from her past: Griffin Preston, who is now an earl.  Lord Bromley (that's Griffin) fell in love with Miss Milford all those years ago... and now he's expected to court her cousin!  But spending time with Priscilla is a good cover for spending more time with Miss Milford.<br />Will Griff be able to convince Miss Milford to give him a second chance?<br />There were a lot of good things about this book.  I liked the characters, and there was a nice secondary romance thrown in.  And while Ms. Hinshaw's plot was nothing new, she succeeded in breathing new life into an old premise.  But the book had its slow moments--especially toward the end.  And I was hoping it would wrap up a bit more nicely.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars.  It's a pleasant book.	2003-11-27

In order to save his family and tenants, he needs to marry an heiress. A friend of the family refers him to Juliana Hutton, a girl who is supposedly very rich and very beautiful.  When Marcus goes to meet Juliana, she has flown the coop.  <br />Marcus then postpones his meeting with Miss Hutton and travels to London, where he meets a beautiful new opera dancer.  She goes by the name of Juliette Lamont, and her beauty is widely renowned.  Juliette is actually Juliana, who intends to go to great lengths to preserve her freedom--even if it means running away from home and pretending to be an opera dancer.  As Juliette, Juliana meets an intriguing man named Lord Dare, who is none other than Marcus himself.  He is in the middle of a masquerade of his own.<br />Of course, this is just the beginning.  Having read the beginning of the novel, I had really high hopes for it.  Up until this point, the plot was really intriguing.  Of course, their mutual ruses eventually unravel... but not before a really racy, inappropriate scene takes place.  After this, I could NOT like Juliana.  She was one of the most deplorable heroines I have ever come across.  Her behavior radiates from scandalous, to cold, to wanton, to bratty, to immature, to ridiculous.  I didn't like anything about her.<br />Poor Marcus spends a good portion of the novel trying to convince her he's not a blackguard.  Well, what about HER bad behavior???  I couldn't figure out why Marcus liked her.  At the end of the novel, I felt really sorry for him.  <br />I'd give this book 1 1/2 stars.  One star just seemed a bit too harsh, for I DID finish the book.  But I wouldn't recommend it.	2003-11-24

But shy, proper Miss Twainsbury doesn't give him much notice.  Having parted with the stranger at an inn, she trudges off to Nanny Mallow's house--in a snowstorm.<br />When she finds Nanny Mallow, the old woman has taken a nasty fall from her bed (and has been laying on the ground for 2 days!).  Camilla goes to get help.  Before she makes it, she passes out in the snow... and is rescued by the stranger from before, Sir Philip.<br />Camilla and Nanny Mallow end up staying at Sir Philip's domicile for quite awhile.  Sir Philip, a published writer, gets Camilla's advice on his fiction novel.  Lady LaCorte, his widowed sister-in-law, is bitter about Camilla's presense.  There are other characters abounds, such as the dashing Dr. March, and Sir Philip's three neices.  <br />&quot;A Yuletide Treasure&quot; DID have its moments.  For instance, I enjoyed the snowball fight that took place, and I really liked a few of the characters.  However, most of the book was pretty slow and grueling.  A lot of the dialogue didn't seem to add anything to the story.  I didn't really like the ending.  Not only was it depressing, but there was also a BIG surprise that no one seemed too shocked about.  And there were too many loose ends.  (For instance, what about Tinarose's crush on the doctor?).  Overall, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't good.	2003-11-18

His first instinct is to hire a new estate manager, as the current one had grown senile.<br />The estate manager's daughter, Olivia Faraday, is less than excited about the viscount's arrival.  Two years ago, she met him during her Season--very briefly.  He represents success and privelege, everything Olivia resents.  She herself is destitute.  Though her sisters seem smitten with the viscount, Olivia thinks he's pompous.  And he thinks Olivia is a prickly gorgon. <br />But the more they banter with each other, the more they like each other... though neither of them are willing to own up to the unlikely attraction.<br />This book is very, very good.  VERY good. The dialogue crackles with life, and the author managed to breathe a lot of personality into her characters.  There was never a dull moment.  The story is full of wit and charm, and leads up to a wonderful, heart-warming ending.  If you don't smile when you read this, I'll be very surprised.  The characters were very young, but the book is very enjoyable.  I definitely recommend it, especially for the holidays.	2003-11-13

After all, it is her father's wish.  The first man she comes across is Lord Weyland who, unfortunately, is not on her list.  (Literally, Catherine constantly consults something she refers to as \\"The List\\") After all, Lord Weyland is a mere baron... AND he is rich.  For her own reasons, Catherine would prefer to marry a poor English gentleman.<br />Unfortunately, she finds herself attracted to Lord Weyland, who seems agreeable in every way.  And the bookish Weyland is also intrigued by the headstrong American... even though he has no desire to marry.  As Catherine sorts through her many suitors, Lord Weyland offers his advice.  It takes awhile for them to realize that her best match doesn't necessarily meet all of her criteria.<br />The first chapter of the novel is witty and promising... but some parts did fall somewhat flat.  The book had an interesting premise, and it WAS good.  But not great.  Sometimes, Catherine was plucky and humorous.  Other times, she seemed rash and self-centered.  I liked Lord Weyland, but his behavior toward the novel's left me somewhat disappointed.  But there were also things to admire about the novel.  Catherine's plump cousin, Becky, was a refreshing character--I would have liked to see more of her (I felt like she was slighted).  Also, there are a couple of interesting surprises. <br />Ultimately, I'll be looking forward to seeing more of Laurie Bishop.  She definitely has potential.	2003-11-10

When they finally make it back to England, Prestwick thinks he has seen the last of her.  ...But he couldn't be more mistaken.  Nor could he be more mistaken about Zara herself.  The spitfire girl could be just what he needs...<br />I really enjoyed this book.  As always, Andrea Pickens' writing style is impeccable.  The beginning of the novel is laugh-out-loud funny, and the end is sweet &amp; fulfilling.  Unfortuanately, what keeps this book from earning its 5th star is the fact that toward the middle, I was struggling to keep my mind on it.  Overall, it's a good story about opposites attracting... then finding out they had more in common than they thought.  My favorite character was Stump, the humorous 1-handed valet.  He was a riot.  I would've liked to see more of him.	2003-11-07

His younger brother lost a family heirloom, the Manning Mermaid.  According to Nigel's father, the absence of the pendant will evoke a curse on the family. <br />The pendant is currently in the possession of Emily Winterhaven, who received it as a gift from her grandfather.  She has grown rather attached to the mermaid, and would never part with it.  When she goes to spend Christmas with a friend, Nigel is also there.  She doesn't know who he is (he's the brother of the man who once jilted her!), and she doesn't know he's after her pendant.  As Emily and Nigel grow fond of each other, things start to get complicated.  <br />Other characters add flavor to the story.  Lady Susan and her mother, who are determined to catch Nigel in parson's mousetrap, also join in on the Christmas festivities.  I also enjoyed Nigel's scheming cousin Aubrey.  <br />Overall, the novel was very good.  It had its sweet moments, but it also had its slow moments.  Sometimes, the storyline seemed a bit forced, but it's overall a very pleasant read.  The characters are good, and the ending made me smile.	2003-11-04

Nevertheless, her interest is piqued by Adrian, Duke of Ashton.<br />When Adrian meets Maeve Irvine on the docks, he is intrigued by her, though thinks her behavior borderlines and scandalous.  Then, he finds out Maeve's true identity--she's the cousin of his late wife!  Maeve's aunt think they would make a good match.  Adrian's mother thinks the American girl is an uncouth, unsuitable match for her son.  Adrian's experience with his late wife has also put him off of remarrying, even though his daughter could benefit from a mother.  He is attracted to Maeve, but thinks she might lack moral fiber.  So he decides to keep an eye on her...<br />Generally, this book is about 2 heartbroken people who suffer from a series of misunderstandings. Throughout the novel, Adrian always assumes the worst about Miss Irvine.  I liked the characters, but I sometimes thought the novel was a bit tiresome.  Usually, it takes me about 2 days (3, at the most) to read a book like this.  This book took me six.  That doesn't mean I didn't like it.  I just didn't love it.	2003-10-27

Augusta always thought he was a no-good rogue, and never approved of her sister's beau.  However, Clarissa (her sister) is not with him.  Rather, he has just been jilted by her!<br />Her sister's children seem to adore Richard, who offers his assistance until Clarissa is found.  Together, they try to make the best of the Christmas season with the 3 children.... whose mother may or may not come back.<br />Kate Huntington gives us another charming story, which I can comfortably call one of the best Christmas Regencies I've ever read.  It's sweet, funny, heart-warming and touching.  It's not predictable, and the precocious children are delightful (even the sometimes bratty 4-year-old, Cynthia).  The ending was slightly rushed, but that hardly seemed to matter in light of everything else.  If you only read one book for the holidays, I'd recommend this one.	2003-10-21

Read it at your own risk.<br />Jacob Winters, Earl of Hawthorne, is a handsome, quick-tempered rake who never beds the same woman twice.  The last thing he needs is a snotty, scandalous, nineteen-year-old ward.  His ward, having lived her whole life in India, is ignorant of the customs in London society.  If he is to give Harriet (his ward) a proper come-out, he'll need the help of his childhood friend, Emily Hughes.<br />Emily Hughes is about to experience her first Season--at the age of twenty-four.  She befriended Jacob during one summer ten years ago--and she never forgot him.  She loves him, fantasizes about him, and hopes he shares her feelings.  When he foists his beautiful, exotic (and hateful) ward on her, everything changes.  Not only must Emily share her Season, but her plans to win Jacob's heart have been thwarted.  <br />There are many twists in the novel, none of which I will spoil for you.  It is a superbly written, interesting story that kept me turning pages all day.  Even the smallest character added something to the book. In fact, I would have given easily given this book a 4-star rating... if not for a few personal preferences.<br />First and foremost, this book suffers from what I like to call &quot;Underdog Downfall Syndrome.&quot;  The symptoms: We're introduced to a hero, who we sometimes like, sometimes dislike.  We're introduced to the &quot;other&quot; guy, who often seems sweeter and more attentive than the hero.  Even though the &quot;other&quot; guy has no chance, the reader still has hopes for him.  Toward the end, the &quot;other&quot; guy suffers from some extreme piggishness, which thereby solidifies our desire for the heroine to end up with the hero.  I don't understand why the &quot;other&quot; guy in these novels (he's always so intriguing at the beginning) must always endure the same fate.<br />Also, the novel was a bit more racy than the average Regency.  I don't mind racy, but... sometimes, it didn't seem appropriate.<br />Other than that, the story was really good, and the characters were some of the most animated.  I liked it a lot, and I do recommend it.	2003-10-18

He meets lovely Jenna, and starts to believe that wishes come true.  This is a fun story, and I've always been a fan of Metzger's humor.  My only qualm lies within the tepid heroine.  4 stars.<br />In &quot;Following Yonder Star&quot; by Emma Jensen, Alice Ashe is preparing to have an Irish Christmas--without Gareth, the beau who abandoned her years ago.  When he shows up for the Christmas festivies, Alice has mixed feelings about his unexpected arrival.  Gareth, who plans to leave after Christmas, starts to wonder if he'll have a reason to stay.  He still have feelings for Alice.  ...This was an interesting story, aside from the fact that it veered from the plot sometimes.  3 stars.<br />In &quot;Merry Magpie&quot; by Sandra Heath, Charlie Neville blames the downfall of his marriage on his estranged wife's aunt's... bird.  It was because of the drunken (yes, drunken) magpie that his infidelity was exposed.  5 years later, he returns as a more mature man, hoping to get a second chance.  This story was pleasantly different in the way it consisted of mostly flashbacks, which eventually led up to a 10 page reunion between the couple.  In spite of the lack of interaction between the main characters, I still enjoyed it.  4 stars.<br />In &quot;Best Wishes&quot; by Edith Layton, newlyweds Pamela and Jonathan suddenly find themselves at odds with each other.  They can't agree on anything, and both spouse and husband end up being miserable during different parts of the holidays. Together, they must search for some common ground.  I really wanted to enjoy this story, but I was irritated by Jonathan's controlling behavior, and by Pamela's whininess.  2 1/2 stars.<br />In Carla Kelly's &quot;Let NothingYou Dismay,&quot; Miss Cecilia Ambrose finds herself in close quarters with the family of her pupil, Lucinda.  She is intrigued by Lucinda's uncle, who is both caring and intelligent.  But Uncle Trevor harbors a secret--he blames himself for a tragedy that happened many Christmases ago.  Somehow, Cecilia must help him to rid himself of his sorrows.  As I would expect of Carla Kelly, the character developement is superb.  4 1/2 stars.<br />To sum things up: This collection of Christmas stories (all written by popular writers of the genre) is pleasant in every way, and does an adequate job of presenting the spirit of the season.	2003-10-15

Lord Warwick, the man she crashed into, is surprised to discover how much he wants to kiss Georgiana.  So he kisses her.  And they both enjoy the kiss immensely.<br />Never mind the fact that he's married to her cousin, Catherine.  Never mind the fact that Catherine is missing.  Never mind the fact that Lord Warwick is thought to have murdered his wife!<br />This is the twisted beginning to a very twisted story.  Not to mention, it was filled with plenty of colorful characters.  The author was actually weaving 3 interconnected romance plots.  We are introduced to Andrew Halliday, Georgiana's brother (who has a prominent limp).  We meet Marigold, who has been married 3 times (and she's only 26).  Marigold lost her late husband's treasure, The Norwood Emerald. Carlisle Sutton is a man obsessed with India (he is also obsessed with reclaiming the Norwood Emerald).  We are also introduced to Sarah-Louise Inchquist, who has an infatuation with Peregrine Teasdale, a handsome young man who constantly spouts off poetry.<br />If you can make sense of any of that (and if you want to read something vastly unique), you might enjoy this book.  I, however, thought there was too much going on at once.  I thought the plot was pretty jumbled.  However, I did like the witty dog, Lump.  And I thought Maggie Mackeever had a way with words.  Overall, I'd give the book 2 1/2 stars.	2003-10-09

She travels to England with her aunt and uncle, expecting it to be exciting, only to find that it is anything but.  Emma has very little patience for etiquette and Society.  Hoping to find the adventure she came for, Emma dresses as a maid and sneaks into the streets of London.<br />While there, she is rescued by a man named Jack Howard, who is dressed as a tradesman.  He says he is a secretary--and she doesn't remember meeting him the previous night.  Jack, who is actually Viscount St. Albans, is intrigued by the dark-haired beauty who claims to be a Russian maid (he knows the truth about her identity).  Jack decides to play along with her ruse.  Together, they spend one magical night on the streets of London.<br />Emma is afraid she'll never see Jack again.  Of course, they DO meet up again... about 1/3 of the way through the novel.  This interesting beginning is followed by a grueling middle and end.<br />&quot;Lady in Disguise&quot; lacked the mysticism of Amanda McCabe's previous novels.  The characters were (in my opinion) rather dull.  I became irritated by the heroine's naivete and impulsiveness.  We were introduced to a mere skeleton of a villain, who barely made an appearance in this overlong novel.  The ending was awkward and rushed.<br />Fortunately, the novel is well-written and easy to read... if you can commit to the 278 bland pages (178, if you exclude the good beginning).	2003-10-08

However, it's her fear that the current earl, after hearing her story, will simply turn her away.  When she meets Edward Beresford, he is nothing like the monster she expected.  In fact, he is actually quite nice.<br />Mr. Beresford, who has no real interest in his earldom, intends to help Helen prove her claim--even if his entire family thinks her story is too far-fetched.  While he investigates her claim, Helen Prestwick stays in close quarters (she's trying to restore his family's art collection).  The more they get to know each other, the closer they become.  <br />But Miss Prestwick is hiding a secret from her past--a secret she feels might rattle Mr. Beresford's newfound friendship with her.<br />All in all, the story was nothing I hadn't read before.  The lead characters were interesting, if not a bit stubborn.  (I was happy to find a hero who wasn't handsome, or arrogant, or a rake).  The secondary characters were a bit surprising (a couple of them turned out to be better than I had originally suspected).  But the main story is somewhat predictable, and the ending is a bit rushed.  Still, I came across a few parts where I was unable to put the book down.  Overall, Ms. Barbour has given us an enjoyable read.  I give it 3 1/2 stars.	2003-10-04

The novel goes by very quickly.  Even so... I often found myself wishing something, err... more exciting... would happen.  Still, the novel is thoroughly enjoyable.  I, for one, enjoyed the small, clever plot twists at the novel's end.  But I'm not sure Natalie's brother is worthy of his own novel.  His character was a bit weak.	2003-09-20

So he ends up staying with Mrs. Graves for several days, doing chores for her and learning more about her.  <br />David Winterbrook is a widower, and Madeline is a widow--and both of them have very turbulent pasts.  As the days go by, their secrets slowly unfold, and their feelings for each other grow.  More than anything, it's a story about Madeline's trust and recovery (her husband was a tyrant).  Susannah Carleton gives us a story that is mature, tender, touching and... almost enlightening.  Both characters possess a lot of depth, and the author helps us understand their feelings.  I adored David Winterbrook.  He was so gentle, charming and understanding--he was almost saintly.<br />Strangely enough, the climax seemed to occur toward the middle of the story.  The rest of the novel is spent resolving the unresolved.  (But it's not necessarily a bad thing).  I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;A Twist of Fate&quot;, and would definitely recommend it.  I look forward to reading more of Ms. Carleton's work in the future.	2003-09-15

And the more time Caroline &amp; Raymond spend together, the more they enjoy each other's company.<br />In fact, Mr. Jeffries falls for Miss Sedgewick rather quickly...<br />There was enough going on in the book to keep my interest.  Caroline's determined ex-fiance was interesting.  The dialogue is witty and delightful.  Mr. Jeffries' character is so, SO charming.  He was a wonderful hero.  At times, I thought Caroline Sedgewick was a little too weepy and self-deprecating.  Still, it was good to read about a heroine who wasn't necessarily a diamond of the first water.<br />I enjoyed this novel, and thought it was much better than Joy Reed's last one.

His father was the guardian of several children... and now Val himself is their guardian!  He travels to the rundown Foster estate to find 3 unruly boys, one eager young man, and the boyish Kat Foster (who he originally mistakes for a boy).  Val, a former officer in the British army, thinks he always knows what is best.  He decides to send the boys off to school, purchase a commission for the eldest, and find a husband for Kat.<br />But Kat Foster has other things in mind.  She enjoys her country life--riding horses, wearing breeches and shooting pistols.  She is determined to reunite her family, and will go to great lengths to do so.<br />&quot;The Defiant Miss Foster&quot; DID have its moments.  It starts off with a bang (quite literally), and there were a few delightful moments throughout.  However, I thought Kat's behavior often borderlined on ridiculous.  And I'm not quite sure how (or when) the characters fell in love.  In fact, I'm not thoroughly convinced that Kat was in love with Val at all.  The romantic chemistry between the hero and heroine was nearly nonexistent, but the author's humor makes up for the lack.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars.<br />NOTE: &quot;The Defiant Miss Foster&quot; is a new story by Melinda McRae. The second story, &quot;The Highly Respectable Widow&quot;, is a reissue.	2003-08-24

Lucy Winthrop, a spinster and a governess of 10 years, has dreamed of opening up a school for girls.  Though she has been recently dismissed, she has also stumbled onto a bit of good fortune.  Due to this good fortune, she is able to turn down the position as Lord Granville's governess (he is a widower with 3 young children).<br />John Weston, Lord Granville, is shocked when Lucy rejects his offer of fifty pounds her annum.  He is equally shocked when Miss Winthrop shows up at his door, wondering if his offer still stands.  Poor Lucy Winthrop's luck just ran out, and Granville reluctantly gives her the position.  As it turns out, Miss Winthrop is the best governess he's ever had.  <br />As Lucy comes to know more about the children, she discovers how much they crave their neglectful father's attention.  After Lucy goes a great service for Lord Granville, he jokingly offers her 3 wishes.  But just what will Lucy wish for...?<br />I just LOVED this book.  If I could give it 6 stars, I most definitely would.  I loved everything about it.  Lucy was an excellent heroine, and I could relate to her feelings.  I loved Lord Granville, and the tension between the 2 characters is to-die-for.  Shirley Kennedy's character developement was positivley superb!!  I loved the subplot with the children.  I loved the subplot with Regina, Lord Granville's invalid sister.  (Her secondary romance was worthy of its own story!)  Every character added to the story.  Lord Granville's mother was despicable.  Miss Winthrop's sister was a delight.  I loved how the author wove in the &quot;wishes.&quot;  I can't remember the last time I read such a well-crafed piece of work.  From the time I opened it, to the time I finished it... I could hardly put it down!  The ending was one of the sweetest and most fulfilling.  I nearly cried at the end!  I have a weakness for governess stories, and this one was undoubtedly one of the best I've read.  (It's one of the best Regencies I've read this year!)<br />In short, this novel comes highly recommended.  It's a very &quot;feel good&quot; story.	2003-08-18

She is described as a recluse and a gentle soul.  Her family is supposedly descended from a powerful witch, and Laura has a way with animals.  Not long ago, an old gypsy woman told Miss Endicott she'd marry a man named &quot;Julian&quot;.  The only Julian she knows is Lord Sandhurst, Viscount Sandhurst: her neighbor, whose land marches with her own.<br />Laura always thought she WOULD marry Julian... but then she finds a wounded stranger on her land.  This stranger calls himself &quot;Strider Hunt,&quot; and he turns her world upside down: through stolen kisses and mysterious secrets.  Laura cares for Mr. Hunt and nurses him back to health.<br />I admit that Maria Greene is not one of my favorite writers.  I didn't enjoy her last book, &quot;The Ashcroft Curse.&quot;  But Laura, who was a secondary character in &quot;Ashcroft,&quot; was the best thing about that book.  That's why I was eager to get my hands on this one.  However, I was **terribly** disappointed.  In &quot;The Ashcroft Curse&quot;, Laura was incredibly sweet, gentle, innocent and... I likened her to a &quot;Regency Snow White&quot;.  In THIS book, Laura was like that... but only for the first 100 pages.<br />After the first 100 pages, she had suddenly transformed into an unfeeling, tart-tongued girl who wished harm on our Hero.  (In a particulary low moment, she even pinches his wounded arm).  She insults him--and I don't think she was justified in the least.  Throughout the book, SHE'S the one who puts HERSELF in compromising situations.<br />I simply don't understand what happened to the lovely, tender-hearted version of Laura.  She disappeared before I reached the middle of the novel.  And I was very disappointed in the villain.  In &quot;The Ashcroft Curse&quot;, our villain seemed rather pleasant. I didn't want him to be as bad as he was.<br />Laura admittedly &quot;loathes&quot; the hero for 200 pages of the novel.  She suddenly &quot;loves&quot; him when she finds out who he REALLY is.  (And it's good news).  In my eyes, it made her look even worse--like she had a change of heart after finding out he's more than he seems.  UGH!  Needless to say, I didn't find the romance convincing.<br />I gave it two stars because... well... I finished it.  Other than that, &quot;Lord Sandhurst's Surprise&quot; was a total disappointment.

Miss Caroline Parker loves her life of freedom and independence, and her ponies are her most prized possessions.  But now her mother is demanding she have a Season--and marry this year!  Caroline has few prospects and no money.  If Caroline is going to catch a rich husband, she'll have to learn how to be a lady from her starchy Aunt Augusta.<br />Captain Thomas Ogden met Caroline while she was still living with her cousins.  They befriended each other very quickly, and decided to brave the Season together.  Thomas is going to acquire a penniless estate, so he is seeking a lady with a large dowry.  He and Caroline concoct a plan: Thomas will give her the scoop on all of the male &quot;Eligibles,&quot; while Caroline tries to learn more about the lady &quot;Suitables.&quot;<br />Of course, the feelings between the two develop. But Caroline and Thomas both need to marry money.  Will love conquer all?<br />At times, I thought the book was rather dull.  There was a lot of &quot;horsing around.&quot;  (And I'm not talking about Caroline's ponies, who made few appearances). Every chapter consisted of Caroline &amp; Thomas meeting, kissing, parting, and reflecting on how they felt.  EVERY chapter.  It was rather redundant, and there seemed to be a lack of substance.  Quite honestly, I spent a large portion of the novel not caring whether the main characters ever got together.  The last chapter, however, was sweet and redeeming.  <br />Overall, I wouldn't give it any more than 2 1/2 stars.	2003-08-01

Miss Drusilla Herbert has taken on the position as a companion--to one of her mother's old school friends.  Drusilla and Lady Brentford get along famously, and Drusilla agrees to help the lady throw a party in celebration of ther older woman's birthday.<br />Enter Lord Brentford, Adrian Richmond: the Lady's son.  He is suspicious of his mother's companion, so he travels to the country to see what Drusilla's all about.  Adrian is intrigued by Drusilla, the beautiful country mouse with a brazen tongue.  And while he's initially against the idea of a party, he eventually consents to it.  <br />Several party guests grace the pages of the novel with their unique presences.  Lord Brentford's friends are dashing (and some of them deserved bigger roles).  Snobby Lady Felicia is delightfully (but not entirely) bad.  Every character adds something to the story--even Mrs. Knight's annoying pooch!  Overall, the novel is light and entertaining.<br />But it's also predictable.  And if you're familiar with Regencies, it's really nothing new.  <br />Still, you should definitely pick it up.  Every word is enjoyable.	2003-07-27

She is still in mourning when her brother-in-law comes around with an offer to make her his mistress.  Young widow Roxanna is poor and has two young daughters.  Instead of accepting such a dubious offer, she rents the dower house on Lord Winn's estate.<br />Lord Winn, Fletcher Rand, ex-army colonel, is plagued by scandal.  Polite society no longer accepts him: he is divorced.  Just before Christmas, he travels to Moreland--and is surprised to see a young widow and her two daughters living there.  Lord Winn fits in almost immediately.  He is delighted by the company of Roxanna and her two little girls.  <br />But fate has dealt them both a difficult hand.  Throughout the course of the novel, Carla Kelly makes us laugh and pulls at our heartstrings--in the way only SHE can!  It's sweet, it's touching, it's poignant, it's mature...  Mrs. Drew is truly a magificent, moving tale!<br />This two-in-one re-release of 2 previous Kelly novels would be an excellent addition to your shelves!	2003-07-22

She and her husband had been working on an archeological dig at a 800-year-old Viking village--that just happens to be on Miles' land! Unfortuntely, the man who could take her dream away from her is the same man with whom she feels a romantic connection.  Even before he arrived, widowed Sarah had dreams about Miles.   <br />Once again, Amanda McCabe delights.  The book is filled with romance, intrigue--and yes, &quot;a touch of magic.&quot;  Every single character added to the story in some way.  Only one thing left me highly disappointed.  The secondary romance with Sarah's young sister was often more interesting than the primary one.  Sadly, it was left **totally** unresolved.  I hope we'll learn more about Miss Bellweather in one of McCabe's upcoming novels.	2003-07-16

It is totally misleading.  After reading it, I was expecting an entirely different story.<br />Miss Amabel Armstrong's brutal uncle plans to marry her off to the highest bidder.  And while her uncle may be cruel, she does intend to follow his wishes.  But Amabel is uncharacteristically beautiful, and as soon as she is given a Season, she is hounded by a flock of besotted suitors.  Throughout the course of the novel, several of them kidnap her!<br />Max, Earl of Maxbridge, has been in the snares of a fortune hunter before.  He is convinced that Amy (lovely, though she is) is a fortune hunter. And Max's nephew is smitten by Amy.  So why does he find HIMSELF under the spell of the beautiful girl?<br />For the most part, the novel consisted of a whole lot of nothing.  There were too many idle moments, during which there were discussions about politics and character introductions that did nothing to move along the main plot.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stand Amabel.  I can't quite tolerate heroines who make comments like &quot;my beauty is a curse&quot; and dissolve into tears every other chapter.  However, if you can make it past the first 120 pages, the novel does have its wittier moments.  Overall, I'd only give it 2 1/2 stars.  If you have patience, you'll probably enjoy it.	2003-07-13

While there, Olivia hopes to publish a volume of her deceased cousin's love poetry.  However, she can't publish the poems until she discovers the identity of her cousin's beau.

He is determined to find her again...<br />But a series of misunderstandings befall the budding lovers.  <br />Who is &quot;D?&quot;  Well, it's not hard to figure out.  I'd figured out the entire story by the time I reached Chapter 2 or 3.  So yeah, it's very predictable.  The story is slow, and we're introduced to a ton of characters who benefit the story in no way whatsoever.  Even the lead characters seem somewhat... vapid.  On a positive note, the dialogue was good, and I thought the Epilogue was refreshing.	2003-06-24

But gentle Daniel Nealy is also falling for her.  Which man will come out on top?  And whose intentions are honorable?  This was a nice story, but I was disappointed by how the \\"other\\" guy turned out.  For a good portion of the story, I really liked him.

First, he overhears her criticizing one of his plays.  Then, he is witness to her not-so-delicate fall into a pond.  Stephen finds himself thinking about Lucinda a lot--and he takes her criticism to heart.  Perhaps she can help him write a better play?  I didn't really enjoy this one.  First of all, it was clogged with characters from Paquet's former novels--none of which I have read.  I found it very distracting.  Secondly, I didn't really like the heroine.  I thought Lucinda was overly critical of Stephen. If someone made so many shameless suggestions about MY work, I wouldn't want to have anything to do with them.  1 1/2 stars (the extra half-star being for the sprinkling of wit)<br />Overall, a decent read.

A beautiful heiress, at that.<br />While quietly reflecting matters in his garden, a girl falls from the sky--literally.  Jane Rutledge was trying to spy on the viscount from a tree, but she comes crashing down.  Jane is a plain, mousy, sprite of a girl.  And yet... Sebastien finds her intriguing.<br />But plain Jane isn't what he's looking for.  Incidently, he sets out to woo Jane's sister, Penelope--a beautiful girl with a large dowry.  Penelope is very protective of her younger sister and the lack of attention she receives.  In order to impress Penelope, Sebastien decides to befriend Jane.  <br />And then he compromises Jane.  And they are forced into marriage...<br />The book was very nice, engaging, and it always kept my interest.  It moved along at an excellent pace.  Jane was very spirited, humble, and stands up for what she believes in.  Sebastien was a gentleman rogue (only once throughout the course of the novel did he fall from my good graces).  The 3-star rating is mainly due to personal preference.  I'm not a huge fan of marriages of convenience.  Also, I thought Penelope and her beau were slighted.  I would have liked to know more about them.<br />Overall, a very enjoyable read.  And fun, too.  I liked the &quot;lists&quot; that Jane made.	2003-06-07

Her kidnappers have held her for four days, and they're still hot on her trail.  Charles is her knight in shining armor.  He stays with her, helping her to avert her captors. <br />Basically, it's a typical damsel in distress story... with some twists.  There are disguises, strange hiding places, plenty of adventures, and a very deadly adversary.  Serena and Charles both express their uninterest in love and marriage--and slowly change their minds.  I definitely liked both characters.  Serena had a lot of spunk, and Charles was a kind, noble man.<br />The book is very fun and engaging.  It has humor, peril, adventure, romance... However, I thought there were some parts of the book that dragged.  Certain scenes could have been shortened.  That is my only complaint.  <br />Don't miss this book.

When their father demands that they all marry heiresses, the three Darby brothers venture to London in search of prospective brides.  Montgomery Darby doesn't have to look hard, for he falls for the first girl he lays eyes on: Adele Landis, diamond of the first water.  <br />But wooing Adele won't be easy, for she already has a horde of suitors.  To assure that he comes out on top, Monty enlists the help of Clarissa Starnes, Adele's cousin.  Clarissa thinks she's falling in love with Mr. Montgomery Darby--but she still wants to help him.  Her terribly bratty cousin would be able to save Monty's father from debtor's prison.<br />The book was light, witty, fun and enjoyable.  However, I think the secondary characters were the stars of the book.  The other Darby brothers &amp; Adele were just as well-developed as the hero and heroine.  Adele was deliciously awful.  And Tristram was the brother I fell in love with.  At the beginning, I thought Tristram was bizarre and immature.  However, he proved himself to be the most sensitive, most caring brother--and he was the only one with a lick of sense.  I would have enjoyed the novel a great deal more if it was a little less predictable.  I would have liked to think, &quot;Hmm... I wonder which brother she'll end up with.&quot;  <br />At any rate, I hope Tristram gets his own novel.  <br />To Marry an Heiress is a fun, thoroughly enjoyable book.  Definitely recommended.	2003-06-02

Dawn Neville is a widow with a little son.  Two unlikely matchmakers (their fathers!) try their hand at forming a love match between the two.  Then Dawn and Hugh figure out what's going on and decide to pretend their fathers' ploy is working...  And I really liked this one.  It was funny.  It was sweet.  The children were cute, and there was always something happening.  There's a nice mix of humor, adventure and romance.  4 Stars.<br />In &quot;A Father's Love&quot;, widower James Martindale moves to a small country village, hoping it'll be a good place to raise his children.  But his children are the very reason he has become an outcast!  Jacob, in particular.  Young Jacob, James's son, is an enigma.  The boy is silent, withdrawn, and seems to live in his own world.  (I believe he is autistic--but they didn't have a term for it back then).  Theresa Barclay is a respected woman--even if she does meddle in people's lives.  Theresa, a spinster by choice, sets out to make James and his children acceptable by the townspeople.  ...As far as short stories go, this one's a real winner.  For being just 90 pages long, it was REALLY well-developed.  The characters were fully fleshed-out, there were sweet moments, and Jacob's condition was handled really well.  The story really hit home.  Donna Simpson is one of my favorite Regency authors.  She very rarely disappoints, and this is no exception!  5 Stars.<br />Overall, it's a very good anthology.

What she REALLY wants, however, is to charm him into a marriage proposal.  A union with Damien (the duke) would solve all of her financial woes.  <br />Unfortunately, His Grace isn't nearly as intriguing as Will Ridd, the duke's bailiff.  Will Ridd has worked for the Duke of Ardsley for 5 years, and has worked hard to raise the perfect flock--for perfectly soft wool.  Ridd's wool puts bread on the table for everyone in the town of Stranton--the people think of the bailiff as a sort of saint.  Now the Duke of Ardsley wants to take everything away from Ridd!  (But don't get me wrong--the duke himself is not without quirks and charm)<br />The plot is a lot more intricate than I can describe in a few meager paragraphs.  There is a lot going on in this book.  It's full of passion, power, and heart-wrenching moments.  I caught myself tensing up and tearing up throughout the entire novel. Will Ridd is a very different, very intriguing hero.  And Ursula was a heroine willing to risk everything for love.  That's definitely admirable.<br />However, I thought the characters were a bit too irrational in the end.  For a period of 20 pages, I was incredibly frustrated with both the hero and the heroine.  Also, the book got a bit too melodramic, at times.  In addition, I was able to figure out the &quot;big suprise&quot; when I reached the second chapter.  <br />Still, you can't go wrong to read this book.  It's engaging and well-written the whole way through.  Like every other book I've read by Ms. Butler: it's a keeper.	2003-05-20

The difference: he's a genuinely nice guy.  He's gallant, noble, and every bit a gentleman.  The novel begins when he's on wounded leave (he's one of Wellington's aides-de-camp).  While staying at an inn, he overhears a conversation.  A girl is being kidnapped!!!  Of course, Lord Cardiff jumps to the rescue of the damsel in distress.<br />That damsel is Miss Thea Strafford.  Her sister's fiance has kidnapped her, and plans to take Thea to Gretna Green!  Lord Cardiff comes to her rescue, and takes it upon himself to see that she is safe.<br />But our hero and heroine are out of the frying pan and into the freezer.  The next day, Thea's father and brothers barge in--and demand that Cardiff marry Thea! (at gunpoint!) Her numbskull brothers kidnap them, and the rest of the novel begins.  Thea and David have to deal with her eccentric relatives, renew Thea's deteriorating reputation, and try to thwart the unwanted marriage... with some funny results!  <br />Yes, the book is rather funny.  And sweet.  And thoroughly entertaining.  However, I would have liked just a bit more romance.  And I thought it ended too quickly.  But it's still a very good read.  Definitely recommended!  Good job, Ms. Buck!	2003-05-16

In that particular book, I felt left out--because the characters from the prequel were just as important as the main characters.  That's why I put it aside.  That is not the case with &quot;Rachel's Change of Heart.&quot;  Had you not read either of its predecessors, you could still enjoy it.<br />Now, the plot:  Rachel Neville is a veritable ice princess.  She is beautiful and ladylike--a diamond of the first water.  She is cool, emotionally aloof, and incredibly proper.  Her fiance, Yarnell, is very much like her--and she certainly doesn't love him.  And she never loved Colin Varens, the suitor she rejected many times in the past.<br />Colin, on the other hand, has loved Rachel for years.  He had proposed to her every year, but the love was always unrequited.  In need of an emotional outlet, he takes up boxing.  And while his spinster sister, Andromeda, has always been against the sport--he finds that he is getting very good at it.  And he begins to accept the fact that he and Rachel will never be together.<br />The first half of the novel deals with Rachel and Yarnell, her fiance.  There is very little interaction between Rachel and Colin until the second half.  However, we learn a lot about Andromeda during that time--who provides a very interesting secondary romance.  In fact, I was often MORE interested in Andromeda's subplot, and wanted to hear more about her escapades. Andromeda's romance was a change from the norm.<br />As the novel progresses, Rachel's cool demeanor begins to thaw.  In fact, her character makes a complete turn-around.  Colin was an interesting hero.  He is unattractive, domineering, and utterly masculine.  And while BOTH characters frustrated me at times,they were enjoyable to read about.  I wanted to see them prevail.<br />I did enjoy the book, and I give it a 3 1/2 star rating.  Two little problems I had: 1) The repeated use of such blunt words as &quot;homely&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;hideous.&quot;  2) The epilogue.  In my opinion, parts of it could have been omitted.  That aside, I really liked the book.  However, I'm still waiting for another masterpiece by Donna Simpson.  She hasn't written anything as wonderful and moving as her first book, &quot;Lord St. Claire's Angel.&quot;	2003-05-13

At a party, he could have responded to one of the many tryst notes from his paramours--instead, he rushes off to see his injured nephew. On his way, Alex is attacked by highwaymen. <br />Shot and near-death, he winds up at the house of Arabella Tichley. She is a gentle, practical sort of girl. She loves her simple life at Mabry Green (a small village), and is described as being serious-minded and managing. Bella (and her family) nurses the duke back to health. And as Westlake's strength starts to return, the book's strengths begin to decline...<br />I won't tell you HOW it happens, but Bella's reputation is utterly ruined, and Westlake is involved. If you know enough about Society, gentleman's honor and ruined women--you can guess what happens next. Bella is forced into an unwanted marriage to save herself from being shunned.<br />I really enjoyed the first 100 pages. Up to that point, I had high hopes for the book. But then I was disappointed. At times, Alex is evasive, domineering and... boring. I was frustrated by the way he kept leaving his new duchess. Westlake's character fluctuated dramatically; therefore, I didn't feel like I really KNEW him. And while I sympathized with Bella, who was supposed to be a pratical, bookish sort of girl, I thought she was lacking in common sense. Prior to her run-in with the duke, she had a suitor who was a complete idiot. Why, oh WHY did she ever want to marry HIM?! Also, I was a bit puzzled by her desire for an annulment. Why would she trade scandal for scandal? <br />And while I didn't enjoy many parts of the book, I thought the last 5 pages were uplifting.  Also, I would say that Rhonda Woodward has a good feel for the time period--especially considering this is only her second book. With an idea that is less commonplace and more exciting, she DOES have potential.	2003-05-09

I didn't think it was possible to find a recent Regency release as powerful, emotional and character-driven as Carla Kelly's &quot;The Wedding Journey.&quot;  Then I read &quot;Prospero's Daughter.&quot;  <br />I should start by refuting the synopsis on the back of the novel.  It states that Miranda Runyon is &quot;recovering from a carriage accident.&quot;  But it's more like WASTING AWAY after a carriage accident.  She has been sheltered in her room for over 3 years, shunned by her family, crippled, paralyzed and scarred.  Her family is quite embarrased by her existence--they never even see her.  She's no more than a ghost in the Palfry house.  More or less, Miranda has given up on life.  <br />Then Morgan Pearce enters her life, uprooting everything about her quiet, sheltered, structered (and lonely) life.  He is visiting the Palfry house to offer advice on General Palfry's written memoirs.  By chance, he meets Miss Runyon in the garden--a bitter woman in a Bath Chair.  After their fateful meeting, he takes it upon himself to open her up to the possibilities in life.  The results are slow, but delightful to read.  Over time, Morgan starts to reawaken her mind.  Her body.  Her spirit.  Her heart.<br />I save my 5-star ratings for books like this.  If I could, I'd give it 6 stars.  Heck, I'd give it SEVEN stars.  In my eyes, &quot;Prospero's Daughter&quot; is virtually flawless.  I felt the emotions of the characters, and they tugged at my heartstrings 'til the very end.  The characters go through amazing (yet believable) transitions.  I loved Miranda: her spirit, her feelings, her dry wit.  Morgan is the hero of my dreams.  Their interactions kept me laughing, crying, gasping, and smiling.  At times, I wanted to cheer for them.  At times, I wanted to SCREAM for them.  The antagonist of the novel is quite unique, and there is a mysterious subplot that slowly unfolds.  Upon finishing the book, I felt a void.  I have no more words to discribe what a wonderful experience this novel is.  I am in sheer awe of Ms. Butler's talents.	2003-05-06

Theo Winslow is desperately seeking his father's disapproval.  His strange ambition sends him to a brothal, where he seeks to hire a harlot to pretend to be his scandalous fiance.  But Sallie (the woman who runs the whorehouse) is fresh out of options.  <br />...'Til she turns to Molly Sweet, who works as the cook in Sallie's disreputable house.  Though born a lady, a series of unfortunate events landed Molly in Sallie's employ.  Molly has but one dream: to establish her own inn.  And posing at Theo's mistress would earn her fifty pounds.  With that sum, she'd be well on her way to success.  <br />So, Theo thinks Molly is a prostitute, and Molly plays along with a ruse.  And that's all I'll say about the plot...<br />The characters in this book (secondary AND lead) are great. Molly is a spitfire, saucy little thing.  My heart went out to her.  She is fresh and warm--you just want to embrace her.  Theo was man of many dimensions.  In the prequel to this book (Donnelly's &quot;Proper Conduct&quot;) I thought he was quite childish and annoying.  In &quot;A Proper Mistress&quot; he is still a tempermental, boyish, rake-in-training.  But there are so many layers to his character.  Though not quite a gentleman, Theo is certainly not without charm.  And once he is able to shake the hero-worshipping he feels for his brother, Theo turns out to be a great man.  <br />Like Theo, there are many different layers to this novel.  It's funny, it's touching, it's frustrating, it's heart-rending.  It's about love, FAMILY, sacrifice.  It brought a tear to my eye and left me feeling warm and fuzzy inside.  I didn't want to put it down, and I didn't want it to end.  It comes highly recommended by me (and I don't give a 5-star rating to many things).  Thank you, Shannon Donnelly, for a fresh treasure.<br />Note: You DO NOT have to read &quot;Proper Conduct&quot; to enjoy this book.  It certainly stands on its own.	2003-05-04

She and Evan Langley were caught in a whirlwind romance, and she had promised to marry him... until she married Lord Crandle instead.  Miranda was stuck in a cold marriage with a man 3X her age, and Evan's heart was broken.<br />Now a widow, Miranda travels to the Rothwell estate to help her former governess' daughter, Artemis (a veritable tomboy).  Miranda is to bolster the young girl's confidence and show her some grace.  While Miranda is there, fate lands her in the company of her former love, Evan--now the Earl of Ashbourne.  Miranda starts to wonder if they can rekindle their relationship.  But Evan's hopes are very different from hers.  Evan wants to make Artemis his wife, because Artemis isn't the kind of girl he could lose his head over.  Of course Evan is still attracted to Miranda, but can she convince him to give her another chance?<br />I liked the characters.  Evan possessed a lot of lethargic charm-even if he was a bit pig-headed at times.  I definitely could relate with Evan's feelings, and I could understand his reserve.  Miranda's character transitions were quite believeable.  The hero and heroine weren't perfect, but they were very realistic.  Their thoughts and reactions were very believeable.  Mindel's novel is a strong character piece.  <br />I also enjoyed Artemis, and I thought Evan and Miranda treated her a bit unfairly at times.  Poor, insecure Artemis...  I hope she'll be featured in a sequel where she can find a man who makes her feel worthy of love.  (Perhaps Clasby, Evan's friend?)<br />The book is good.  It's not astounding, but it's good.  It moved along at a quick pace and always kept my interest.  The plot was a bit stale, but the realistic characters made it worthwhile.	2003-05-01

Ever since a witch put a curse on the Ashcrofts years ago, tragic deaths and tragedies have plagued them.  In order to break the curse, she needs to get her hands on the pendant of Laura Endicott--her arch enemy (though she's never even met her).  So she enlists the help of Sir Richard Blackwood, Laura's fiance.<br />But Sir Richard isn't eager to help, for he doesn't want to dupe his fiance like that.  Jillian resorts to blackmail to enlist him.  Very cruel blackmail.  And her character just declines from there...<br />Jillian is a hoyden whose manner of speaking borderlines on scandalous.  She is an eccentric, selfish little tart.  I really didn't like her.  I'm sure she had SOME redeeming quality, but I can't really think of anything right now.  Richard's character seemed rather comatose.  Richard and Jillian spent 95% of the book bantering with each other.  It gets old.  Even in the end, their romance wasn't very convincing.  However, I DID like Laura, Richard's fiance.  She was very sweet, innocent--she was the equivalent of a Regency Snow White.  Laura, the gypsy lady in the woods &amp; Jillian's scheming cousin were the only redeeming aspects of the novel.<br />I wouldn't recommend it.  It's not unreadable, but there are better choices.  (I'm kind of curious as to whom is featured on the cover of the novel.  Is it Laura... or Jillian?)	2003-04-25

Her charming French charge, Marguerite, injures her arm--and reunites Caroline with her former fiance. Reynaud (or \\"Reynie,\\" as Caroline used to call him) has missed Miss Morton, and must convince her that they are meant to be together--with a little bit of help from Marguerite. But first, Caroline must learn to accept her past... This story receives 4 stars from me. Interactions between Reynaud & Marguerite were sweet, and the characters were warm and convincing.<br />In \\"Rescuing Captain Rocher\\", French sea captain Bastien Rocher finds he knows nothing about giving his daughter a proper come-out. His neighbor, Lady Anne Westhaven, is growing quite frustrated with her troublesome son. And while they don't get along at first, Rocher & Lady Westhaven eventually decide to join forces. Anne will chaperone his daughter, and the captain will give her son the disciplining he needs. ...Actually, I didn't really like this story. Within 20 pages, I think Anne & Marie (Bastien's daughter) had wept about 6 times. I prefer my heroines to have a bit more backbone. Also, I thought Bastien's character was fairly inconsistent. The only redeeming factor was the interesting brother-sister relationship between Marie & Matthew Westhaven (the son). 1 1/2 stars from me.<br />In \\"A Mother at Heart\\", Julius Sutton never expected to be an earl. And he never expected his mother, who abandoned him 22 years ago, to show up at his doorstep. Since he stumbled into his fortune, Julius has had to deal with several money-hungry \\"supposed\\" relatives--none of which he believes. This woman is no different, he is convinced. She AND her pretty companion, Miss Charity Smith, are out to dupe him... even if the pretty chit is one of the most desirable females he's ever met. I give this story 4 stars as well. The ending was surprising and touching and very sweet. I would've liked to read it as a full-length novel, however.<br />The cover & title of the novel are a bit misleading. The picture represents none of the stories.  And only one lead female is actually a \\"mama.\\"<br />Overall, the book is worth your time. Mostly sweet, cute & enjoyable. If you're looking for a quick, noncommital read--this is a good choice.	2003-04-22

Will she hand over her diamond key--the key to her heart--to Wynn?<br />The only problem is, Wynn has no desire to marry.  Because of a scandal 6 years ago, he was banished from society.  Now he has a fortune, and he is being hailed as a hero.  He certainly doesn't want to add \\"Torrie\\" (lovely, though she is) to the list of females who are begging to be his bride.  A former mistress is desperate to marry him.  A penniless widow is desperate to marry him.  His sister-in-law is eager to marry him off to her prim and proper cousin.  But Wynn doesn't want to take a wife--even though he finds himself growing more and more attracted to Miss Keyes.  <br />Overall, the novel is yet another Metzger delight.  But I've read better Metzger books.  \\"The Diamond Key\\" starts with a bang (what could be more exciting than a brush with death?), then loses momentum middle.  Most of the middle consists of Wynn dealing with the other women in his life, and Torrie catching him in compromising situations.  For a period of the book, I was somewhat bored and frustrated.  But the book picks up during the last 100 pages.  You learn to love the characters.  Torrie starts to seems less like a spoiled brat and more like a spirited, feisty woman.  Wynn finally shows his colors as the charitable, caring man that he is.  I loved Homer, Wynn's dog.  (You can always count on Barbara to pen a humorous, heroic mutt).  Even the bumbling villain was worth some laughs.  <br />I would recommend this as yet another light, witty, Metzger read.  (I thought Wynn's struggles with terrible valets were hilarious).  It'll definitely brighten your afternoon.	2003-04-16

After having been jilted by a lover in her youth, she has resigned herself to the role of dutiful daughter, protective sister &amp; spinster.  She always knows what's best for her younger sisters--much to their dismay.  She certainly doesn't want to see Celia, her flightier sister, with one of the rascal Winslow brothers.  <br />Lord Nevin, a half-gyspy upstart, travels to Harwood in hopes of putting aside the bad blood between his family and the Harwoods.  He comes with a business proposition--one that surely won't fail.  (The Harwood father has a knack for picking bad business ventures).  Nevin and his cousin, Bryn Dawes (who always quotes poetry), find themselves caught up in the lives of the Harwood sisters.  <br />Many elements of this book made it quite enjoyable.  Nevin was very alluring.  He was a quiet, handsome, renegade type.  The secondary characters were very well-developed, and I was just as intrigued by them as I was the leads.  There were several twists in the novel, which made it enjoyable the whole way through.  Bryn was an endearing character as well, and provided the means for an interesting secondary romance.<br />Some aspects of the novel left me a little crabby, however.  Celia seemed a bit silly for her age (my age as well), and her ongoing relationship with Theo Winslow was rather annoying.  At times, Penelope seemed a bit TOO cold and TOO reserved.  I really wanted her to open up (which she finally did--5 pages until the novel's end!)  Also, the book seemed to be a bit longer than necessary.  <br />But don't get me wrong, it is good.  More than likely, you'll enjoy it the whole way through.  Shannon Donnelly should be commended on a solid effort.  One can only hope the youngest sister, Sylvain (the shy, animal lover) will be featured in her own romantic tale!	2003-04-10

Even as a little girl, she possessed a strong will and an admirable spirit.  Now she's a young woman, and he has no doubt in his mind that he's in love with her.  But Captain Randall has a problem: he's painfully shy.  He's so shy that some of his fellow soldiers have teased him about it.  <br />Captain Mason, Elinore's father, owes major debts to a man named Major Bones (one of the most despicable villains to grace the pages of a Regency).  In exchange for Elinore, all debts would be paid.  <br />In order to protect her, Jesse weds Elinore just before a retreat.  And so begins Major Bones' revenge.  Jesse, Elinore, and a few others (including some of the sick patients) are left behind, hoping to beat their enemies to the Portugeuse border.  Hence, the title: &quot;The Wedding Journey.&quot;  <br />There are no words strong enough to describe how strongly I feel about this book.  Jesse Randall was a welcome change from all the typical romance heroes.  He's not arrogant, he's humble. He's not sure of himself.  He's not nobility, and he's not incredibly attractive.  He's sweet, but not saccarhine.  Elinore Mason has more courage than 100 London ladies put together.  The supporting characters are fleshed-out and memorable: Wilkie, Harper, Sheffield, Leger, &quot;the count.&quot;  The book wouldn't have been the same without them.  There is so much adventure and power packed into such a small book.  It's quite astounding.  You feel the pain of the characters, you cheer for them, you share in their tragic laughter.  It is SO much more than a romance novel.  I don't know how Carla Kelly does it!<br />If you prefer a light-hearted book, this book may not be for you.  Most of the time, it's quite depressing.  If you're looking for fun &amp; laughter, pick up a Barbara Metzger book.  If you're looking for a deeply moving piece with complex characters, readthis.  You won't regret it.	2003-04-05

When he dies, she is left without a penny to her name... until someone tells her about her husband's last legacy: a gaming hell called &quot;The Golden Feather.&quot;  If she could just maintain it for a few years, she would have enough money to keep her younger sister in school--and perhaps give her the come-out she deserves.  <br />Justin, the younger son of an earl, is a bit of a troublemaker.  He fought 2 duels in the last month, and has become quite the hellion in his father's eyes.  Perhaps a commission in India would straighten him out?<br />4 years later, Justin is Lord Lyndon, and Caroline Aldritch is &quot;Miss Archer.&quot;  But she won't have to pose as the masked gaming house keeper for much longer, because she's set to sell the place.  Before she sells, Lord Lyndon and his younger brother, Harry, visit the Golden Feather.

He's a scholar and a realist, and doesn't have time for all that supernatural nonsense.  But, of course, opposites attract...<br />The real heroes of the story are the ghosts.  Through the course of the novel, we meet humorous spirits, match-making spirits, spirits who pine for lost lovers, and spirits who... DANCE AT BALLS?!  The novel was very light-hearted and fun, but it did get a bit far-fetched at times.  Of course, Amanda McCabe didn't set out to write an informative paranormal piece.  The book reads more like a supernatural satire with a little bit of romance thrown in.  The book wasn't really overflowing with chemistry between the 2 main characters. That was one of my mini-gripes.<br />My other gripe was this: EVERYONE (even the ghosts) received a happy ending in the novel, except for Cassie's friend, Antoinette.  At some point, Antoinette even states, &quot;a love match for me is highly unlikely&quot;... and I was hoping she'd be proven wrong.  She never was.  Antoinette was one of the most refreshing, interesting characters I've read about in a long while.  I agree with what another reviewer stated prior to me: I'd love to see Antoinette in a sequel!  (Though it's highly unlikely)<br />Overall, &quot;A Loving Spirit&quot; is a fun, light read.  It's not perfect, but it is enjoyable.	2003-03-22

She is nabbed by a masked highwayman (who has earned himself the rep of being the local &quot;Robin Hood&quot;).  She loses her ring and a few coins--and demands he escort her home!  <br />Later, Miss Templeton meets Lord Griffin, Gordon.. and can't help but think there's something familar about him.  Is it the voice?  Is it the size of him?  Surely this dashing gentleman couldn't be.. the highwayman?!  Are they one and the same... or does he have a twin?  <br />Of course, I don't want to spoil it for you.  There are many twists and turns in the book, a few laughs, and a whole lot of romance.  The characters are loveable, Daphne has a lot of spunk, and the highwayman is very alluring.  Rhys, a secondary character, also brought a smile to my face. There is even what I'd call a &quot;surprise ending.&quot;  <br />I don't know about the second book, but this Patricia Rice book is a keeper!  It would be worth looking into merely for the first 222 pages!	2003-03-18

Her books are a delight on every page, and \\"Miss Lockharte's Letters\\" is no exception.  I was lucky enough to find a copy of this book: Hopefully, you'll be lucky, too.<br />Rosellen Lockharte thinks she's dying of a fever.  In a moment of delirium, she writes letters to the people who have left impressions on her short life.  Of course... she doesn't die, and the embarrasing letters have already done their damage.  Now, she thinks someone's out to murder her!  Much to her dismay, Lord Stanford (he was the recipient of one of her more hateful letters) comes to her rescue!  <br />The whole book is just a comedy of errors.  It's an absolute riot!  Rosellen has more pluck than any heroine I can remember.  Lord Stanford is dashing, but imperfect (who wants a PERFECT hero?).  The Heatherstone twins (a couple of red-headed cooks) are absolutely hilarious--as is \\"Buck.\\"  (I don't want to spoil anything for you).<br />Get this book!  I smiled the whole way through, and I laughed out loud!  Let Barbara Metzger treat you to her delightful humor!<br />(For a similar experience, find a copy of \\"Snowdrops and Scandalbroth\\" and \\"The Primrose Path.\\"  Though are also hilarious Metzger novels!)	2003-03-12

Their first meeting is a peculiar one, as is every meeting after that.  Cassian and Freddie seem fated to meet each other under strange circumstances.  Cassian is intrigued by the elusive Miss Smith, and Freddie dreams of waltzing with the handsome lord.<br />But there are problems: One being that Freddie is merely the daughter of a lodging house keeper. Another being her flighty friend Lavinia, who convinces Freddie to pose as her cousin.<br />Meetings between Cassian and Freddie are only half the fun.  There is also the mystery that involves a chaperone, an infatuation that involves a poet (not Lord Byron--who makes a few appearances), and a friend with an affinity for purple.<br />If you like cats, you'll like Thomas... even if his heroism is a tad unrealistic.<br />I would only give this novel 3 1/2 stars, however.  The encounters between Cassian and Freddie seemed to be more of an infatuation than true love.  Their romance didn't seem to be the novel's main focus.  Also, it seemed as though some parts were rather slow.<br />Overall: a good read.	2003-03-09

The heroine of this tale, Artemis Rose, was thrown out of her estate by her father's family--who were not so accepting of her Gypsy heritage.  Since she was 8, she has lived as a gypsy, learning to read signs and fortunes.  Now she is down on her luck, with a little sister to care for, and no one to care for HER.  <br />That's when she runs into Lord Lindenshire, Orion (or, as she likes to call him: Lord Logic).  He was her childhood friend and rival.  He is just the same as the boy she remembers from her childhood--albeit, a little more handsome.  After having accepted a job as his mother's companion, one misunderstanding leads to another, and everyone mistakes her for Orion's mistress.<br />Artemis was a charming character.  She was a little bit flaky and naive, but she was loveable.  I had a major problem with &quot;Lord Logic&quot;, though.  For the first 180 pages, he was such a jerk that... well... he couldn't even redeem himself in my eyes at the end.  He was respectful to everyone BUT the heroine, who he was quite rude to the entire time.  He ordered her around.  He insulted her (he even called her &quot;stupid&quot; in front of many people).  And he had the image complex of a teenage girl.  I couldn't like him.<br />Not to mention, if you hadn't read the author's previous book (as I hadn't) you might been a little bit lost.  Miss Ophelia seemed to be an important character in the last books, but she didn't seemed to be fully fleshed out in this one.  It left me feeling as though I was missing out on some inside joke.<br />-One star is for Artemis.  I really liked her.<BR>-The other star is for the book itself, which WAS well-written, even though Orion was so hateful that he made me deduct the other 3.	2003-03-05

Since everyone has already touched on the plot, I see no reason to rehash what's already been said.  I simply want to let this be known: THIS IS AN ADORABLE BOOK! <br />This book has everything.  It has romance (and lots of it!), mystery, intrigue, comedy, adventure.  I hardly ever run across any \\"page-turners\\", but this is definitely one of them!  I loved the hero; he was to die for.  And I love a heroine who can hold her own without being overbearing.  Delia is just that.  <br />This is the best Regency I've read this year, and the story is so lovely!  Do whatever you must to get your hands on this book.  You won't regret it!	2003-02-24

He is bored with life, and feels that no one would miss him if he was dead.  To his friends, he is known as a prankster whose sole purpose in life is to seek pleasure.<br />Lord Yates is surprised when he meets Miss Constance Locke, because she is not what he expected from an American girl.  She is wholly opposed to the English aristocracy, and is always willing to share her negative opinions with Lord Yates.  She is smart, sensible, and... engaged.<br />Though some parts of the novel were quite enjoyable, it left me feeling, for the most part, dissatisfied.  I felt extreme sympathy for the hero of the novel, and wasn't quite sure why he was chasing after Constance the entire time.  And I couldn't quite fall in love with a hero whose opinions could be almost entirely changed to suit the fancy of an opinionated American girl.  Constance was a frustrating character.  Sometimes, I wanted to wring her neck and give Lord Yates a hug.<br />Overall: 2 1/2 stars	2003-02-17
