A greedy author looking to make a quick buck by exploiuting terrorism. Tensions between groups of people including the repeated persecution of one by the other. Sound familiar? Sound new? Not hardly. This all took place during the turn of the twentieth century. <br />Clymer explains that terrorism is not new in America. Workers revolting against their bosses and the system that held them down blew up railway cars and buildings. Supporters of prosecuted miners assassinated the Governor of Idaho. The Haymarket bombing in Chicago in 1886 caused widespread panic. Beause the culprit and the motive were never determined, the uncertainty fueld even more speculation and tension. Jack London capitalized on the voracious appetite for terrorism-related literature in The Assassination Bureau and The Iron Heel, which he specifically mentioned to Macmillan Publishing was ripe for the consumer public. Thomas Dixon and Ida B. Wells wrote about the conditions in the reconstruction South . Dixon glorified the Ku Klux Klan and was concerned about mulattoes and skin bleaching tonic; Wells set out an explanation that the vacuum left by the end of slavery was filled by the phenomenon of rape as a way to control black men. <br />The difficulty with this work is that Clymer does not tie in the past witht he present terrorism situation at any part after the introduction. Clymer's background in English is extremely evident here as this is a beautifully crafted work of rhetoric. However, as a student of history and politics, this work is relegated to a supplementary role as it deals primarily with how terrorism was portrayed in works of fiction. No matter how realistic Henry James, Jack London, and Thomas Dixon's novels may be, they remain works of fiction ans thus unusable to serious students of history. However, this work remains useful for its philosophical discussion of terrorism overall.	2004-07-18

By putting forth the question: How long is the British coast line? Gaddis immediately sets out that if we measure in miles we won't get to the alcoves and cubbyholes and we'll probably end up with a nice round number. If we measure in microns and millimeters, it'll take a while but we'll measure every single bend and dog leg and we'll have a much larger number. Many of Gaddis' metaphors spur philosophical discussions but he does not approach them with a philosophical background, instead he sets out to solve a functional question: What is history? Is it a natural science? If it is, then why can we not replicate any historical findings as biology and physiology can? Is it a social science? Then why do other social sciences like economics and anthropology try to find an independent variable upon which everything hangs when historians try to put out the bigger picture? Gaddis' conclusion then is that history is its own beast. It does not mirror either the hard sciences nor the social sciences although it may pick up some of their properties. <br />All in all, this book is very readable for a historiography and may appeal to non-historians seeking a perspective on history. The chapters read more like the text of a speech than a textbook so the minimal 140 or so pages will make this a very easy read.	2004-03-18

The connections are then developed and this may be a way of making scientists understand the nature of history or giving students with a familiarity in natural sciences a correlation to the study of history. Also, Gaddis' humor makes a philosophical discussion of history a little less tense and certainly more cheerful. <br />All in all, this book is very readable for a historiography and may appeal to non-historians seeking a perspective on history.

Herbert Hoover has a long and storied pre-White House career and that story has some relevance and bearing on his four years in Washington but it is a topic of focus for a different book. <br />Martin Fausold points out that Hoover's four years as president speak volumes about the future course of the United States after March 1933 when Franklin Roosevelt took office. Hoover did not inherit the United States when it was on the verge of collapse nor was it at a peak. Black Tuesday, as Fausold illuminates, was a major turning point in the course of many levels of American movement: economic; social; cultural, and more. Most of this book is a detailed chronicle of the efforts Hoover used to extinguish the conflagration started by the October 1929 crash. Readers will note how small it seems to discuss a stock market crash caused by a drop of 375 or so points when in 2003, we have seen drops of two hundred points in a single day without much fervor or panic. Nonetheless, Fausold explains that the crash wa snot simply a one day event but a series of events throughout various sectors of the market that led to a mass sell off of stocks on Black Tuesday. <br />Most interestlingly, however, Fausold explains that FDR, as early as 1929, made efforts to have his contentions known and demanded an audience with Hoover and policy officials. Fausold also destroys other authors' criticism of Hoover as a silent critic of the Federal Reserve system that practically fathered the stock market crash by pointing out that Hoover moved behind the scenes to inch toward reform because he did not want to destroy public confidence in the banking system. Revelations such as these make this work essential for anyone studying the Hoover presidency or with even a remote interest in any issue relating to Hoover, including the stock market crash.	2004-02-18

This synthesis, however, is a wonderful work of history. Bailey excellently covers the movements of the post-World War I peace effort without spending too much time going back and forth between the armistice and the war or pre-war days. As such, this book reads very easily because the flow is very simple. <br />Bailey's writing style also makes undertaking a daunting task relatively facile. Bailey's topic may be relative to World War I but it is not a military history but rather, more along the lines of a political or even social history. He includes details about diplomatic efforts undertaken at the end of World War I and also covers issues relative to propagating the armistice in the United States. At the very least, the cartoons stand as period pieces that speak volumes about the life and culture of early twentieth century. <br />Those of you who have read Bailey's work before know that he writes in an intelligent and sophisticated manner but one need not be a college level wordsmith to fully comprehend or follow his work. Because this is a synthesis, this may not be a comprehensive study of everything that happened between 1911 and 1920. However, this is a great place to start. Think of this as a building block on which you might build an understanding of the world at the beginning of the twentieth century.	2004-02-18

Bailey	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A Window into Bailey's Work and History	Essays Diplomatic and Undiplomatic stands as a collection of essays without a common lining theme other than the fact that they are all relating to a topic in American history somewhere. That lack of unity makes this work a &quot;sampler&quot; of sorts, where the reader is able to find a topic that is of particular interest and the scholar is able to see how Bailey treats a wide variety of topics ranging from Woodrow Wilson to Alaska to JFK and LBJ and more. <br />While Bailey has written standard monographs and syntheses that cover some of the topics also covered in this collection, he does not quote extensively from those pieces and does not make this a collection of snippets and excerpts from his earlier books, in effect publishing them twice. However, these may be scholarly articles or lectures already in print somewhere else, albeit from rare and expensive sources. As such, this is a relatively inexpensive sampling collection that ranges throughout the whole of Bailey's career as an author and scholar.	2004-02-18

This book is a step by step (albeit black and white steps) instructional guide to painting 60 different paintings in the Bob Ross style. <br />Anette Kowalski has been on Bob Ross' Joy of Painting at least once to paint flowers. She has regularly contributed to the other twenty or so books Bob Ross has written. This is primarily an instructional guide using photographs. However, there is an insufficient amount of time spent on technique.

He covers those who joined the war effort, the war effort at home and abroad, and the various issues relative to the Wilson Administration in terms of effectiveness and quality with a certain sophisticated nature that makes this work a must-have for undergraduate and/or graduate level U.S. history classes. Kennedy's obvious strengths are evident in his coverage of war and the Wilson administration yet it must be noted that his lack of bias must also be taken as a strength.	2004-02-15

She moves seamlessly from labor history to cultural history to ethnic history without losing the reader by including helpful charts, figures, and photographs. Her section on the nature of mass media and mass consumption undoubtedly provides evidence of her writing style in The American Pageant. <br />Cohen does not create a delineation between immigrants that came to the area and natives of the Chicago area, which goes a long way in terms of bias. She covers African-Americans, Polish, Italians, and Jews without being critical one way or the other. Each chapter seems to be able to live by itself, which gives the book a flavor of being a compendium of papers instead of a conjoined work. All in all, Cohen does a wonderful job examining Chicago and Chicagoans whatever their ethnicity may be.	2004-02-15

Naturally, a reader may find anything he seeks in an interpretation of the words of the author yet there is no obvious bias or partisanship on the part of Joan Hoff in this work. The amount of revisionism, however, is quite substantial. Hoff seems to have as her purpose for writing this a decided motivation to revise the history of Nixon from the accounts given by fellows ranging from Ambrose to Wills. Granted, her work is more informed and well rounded compared to Ambrose and less agonizing than Wills' Nixon Agonistes yet there seem to be a lack of entirely new information, which would make this work a better choice for the average reader looking for an unbiased, middle of the road examination of Nixon.	2004-02-15

This account, however, it must be noted takes into account an extensive history of Angola State Prison. Bergner spent time there performing the work of a sociologist: observing, writing, detailing, getting to know the inmates on a personal basis; and even sometimes getting caught in the political tides of the prison administration. This work is as much designed for the general reader who seeks an understanding of the life of a prisoner as much as it is for the student of criminal justice or political science who seeks a knowledge base in prison life. Bergner's talents are clearly on display in this sociological masterpiece that clearly details the emotions of prison life. The graphic behavior exhibited by the characters in this work only serve to intensify the reality of prison life and drive home the point that Bergner makes, chiefly being that Angola State Prison, much like any other prison, is a world apart from normal society. This work is an inside view of that other world. It shocks just the same as Jonathan Kozol's Savage Inequalities.	2004-02-15

Surprisingly, Gates has written a book about race without injecting any invective or peppering it with position papers for how things ought to be, as many political figures would and as Gates himself has done on talk and panel shows. Gates does illuminate the history of black figures in literature and their achievements and accomplishments which may tend to steer this work toward a literary criticism and away from a criticism more appropriate for ethnic studies or black studies. All in all, Gates is a proper steward of black culture: he offers it to the world without any strings.	2004-02-15

This work is no less exceptional. In this book, Davidson puts together primary and secondary sources relative to Early West Africa, Early East Africa, Antiquity, The Meeting of West Africa to Europe, as well as materials relative to and from the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth centuries. Davidson's editorial comments are rather insightful, whether helping to frame an issue in perspective or to introduce a totally new contributor.

Maney clearly exposes his liberal, left-leaning stance by being critical of Roosevelt in certain areas but being supportive in other areas. As a historian, Maney should have presented the facts and let the reader decide. If Maney wanted to voice his opinion or other relevant personal position information, he should have included that in an introduction or in the endnotes.

He outlines 267 maxims or situations for which he provides some sort of historical analysis, practical information, or policy advice. He combines wit, wisdom, and insight to form an essential corollary to his Diplomatic History of the American People. Bailey's best advice may be his caution as to the ascertaining of other nation's interests: \\"Diplomacy resembles chess.\\" Given the changing nature of the 21st century world, as well as its timeless qualities, The Art of Diplomacy still has an important place in the hands of influential government hands somewhere, somehow.	2004-02-15

Both were controversial political figures while in office, Nixon for Watergate and Clinton for the Health Care difficulty as well as her family life. Both wrote insightful works after they left office; Nixon wrote several, Clinton also wrote a decent children's book. Regardless of her political career or future political aspirations, Living History is a good memoir. Clinton chronicles her days in Chicago, her undergraduate career at Wellesley, and her days at Yale Law School with rather insightful detail that may help the average uninformed reader to better understand the events and places that shaped her life. She also chronicles the era when her husband was Attorney General of Arkansas then Governor then President of the United States without adding a plethora of political detail. All the while, she responds to the pressing questions of the critics as well as the readers making reference to or outright explaining controversies that occurred during those periods of time. All in all, Clinton does a good job of blending together the high and low points without seeming bitter or overly critical or taking swipes at any critics, which counts for quite a lot considering her polarizing nature.	2004-02-15

The maps, charts, and photographs show without crowding the material the nature of the battles and campaigns the Union and Confederacy fought against each other. The photographs include gems that drive the ravaging, taxing, bloody hell of war home to readers. One cannot help but be shocked by the photograph on page 490 or many of the others depicting the horrors of war. That is one of many reasons that make this a book worth reading. Also worth mentioning is the meticulous amount of information and the methods by which it is organized. McPherson's text is mainly digested details of the war as he rarely refers the reader to other sources. There is an excellent organization to the text that makes it second to none.	2004-02-15

He covers the slave trade in quite a bit of detail, explaining the value of the African as a marketable commodity. He also explains the origins of apartheid as a colonial parting gift that became entrenched racist national policy for more than fifty years. Shillington's survey is quite appropriate for a high school African history class, an undergraduate African history survey or introduction or even as a first book for a graduate African history course. The topics covered here are obviously from an Africanist point of view although there is a minimum, if any, level of bias on Shillington's part.	2004-02-15

However this work seems more of a history of feminism than a cultural history as Bederman focuses mainly on the achievements of women, the attempts women made for suffrage and better working conditions, all the while trying to explain away the positions of the male counterparts as lacking, unfairly oppressive, or some other pejorative term.

He chronicles in insightful detail the various alphabet soup programs and their roles in the Roosevelt administration. Yet, his main focus is the continued deintensification of liberalism in subsequent administrations and the nature of liberals and their movement from anti-big business and pro-worker to less hostile to big business as many liberals moved from one side to the other. Brinkley follows his discussion of New Deal liberalism with a discussion of the progressive degeneration of liberalism in the age of Truman and Eisenhower and subsequent efforts to foster some kind of rebirth in that time period. In sum, Brinkley's work is rather exceptional. He covers the material without tipping the reader off as to his liberal nature.	2004-02-15

Cunningham explains in great detail many afflictions and circumstances that befell Confederate soldiers that ultimately resulted in medical treatment by a Confederate doctor. Ironically, he finds that the majority of the 200,00 soldiers who died during the Civil War had died due to illness or battle wounds which is indicative of a burgeoning and developing medical system that moved from primitive to slightly better by the end of the war. Cunningham explains that while the Confederate doctors did they best they could with the resources and shortcomings they had, their care was still better than no care and there were some doctors who were exceptions to the popular belief that Confederacy personnel were largely untrained.	2004-02-15

The crowning achievement is the wealth of photographs (18 in all) that depict the struggles and tribulations being crippled cost Roosevelt. The photographs might stand alone as a photo essay to explain the various ways Roosevelt moved around and tried as best he could, with the effort of his team, to hide his affliction from the general public. The two known photographs of Roosevelt in his wheelchair appear in this book, which male this book a gem in any Roosevelt researcher's collection. <br />Aside from the photographs, Gallagher cleverly explains in the text the circumstances of poliomyelitis, the various treatments Roosevelt underwent initially and ultimately the course of therapy at Warm Springs, Georgia. The necessity to hide FDR's debilitating degeneration from the average voting public was so prominent and preeminent in Roosevelt's mind that he went to great lengths to do so, including walking on his own with heavy steel braces or leaning on his two strong sons. This work is a masterful examination of Roosevelt and his administration's, both as Governor of New York and President of the US, efforts to erase forever polio from the public perception of Franklin Roosevelt.	2004-02-14

Crowley's readable work exemplifies the political mind that Nixon used to gain election as a U.S. Senator, the political savvy that kept him on the Republican ticket in 1952, and the mastery that saw his elections change for the better from 1960 to 1968. Crowley doesn't shape anything that Nixon says, other than to put it into proper context, because she knows Nixon's words and ideas speak for themselves. He doesn't need a mouthpiece and not every thing he says is controversial or outlandish and deserving of reprisal from political foes, as any careful reader of Nixon's own books will come to understand. This work further exonerates Nixon from the political graveyard much more so that his own books following his resignation. Crowley's articulate, readable format is sure to rekindle reader's interest in Nixon as a person and as a personality.	2004-02-07

This is as much a book for law students as it is for conspiracy artists. Jones' southern charm comes forth in his capacity as author yet his role as defense lawyer never escapes the reader. Jones covers his bases much of the time, pointing out early in the prologue that he would not have been able to write this detailed account of his conversations with McVeigh had McVeigh's appellate team attacked his capacity as a lawyer during McVeigh's trial. <br />This book is far from sensational and actually is closer to a calm, reasoned look at both McVeigh as a person and United States v. McVeigh as a trial set in perhaps the most bizarre and compromising circumstances in the past fifty years. This book perfectly suits any law school course involving mass destruction or suits any university course concerning political dissent or even the political science of law.	2004-02-07

He weaves together seamlessly foreign and domestic affairs while maintaining a narrative focusing on the various presidents since 1945. Much like Thomas Bailey, Divine approaches his work cognizant of his audience, presumably an introductory college crowd, and keeps his text simple enough to make it readable yet complex and intelligent enough to make it appropriate for a college history classroom. This work also has potential on the graduate scene as well. Divine's lack of visual aids and distractions make this an ideal candidate for 20th century American history seminars. The bulk of texts chosen for American history seminars tend to be less flashy than introductory college texts. <br />Divine mixes foreign and domestic policy and events flawlessly, moving from Truman to Eisenhower to Kennedy without losing sight that the events that either sink or lift an administration do not pause to consider a newly elected leader. Divine also mixes in anecdotal and lesser known details about presidents and presidential candidates. Divine also puts forth the political acumen of Dwight Eisenhower, showing that Ike merely played a coy, grandfatherly type on television but was a different man indeed in the Oval Office. All in all, this work is a good addition to a collection of survey-type texts.	2004-02-07

Before WABC and before a Columbia Ph.D., there was only the college of Richard Nixon. Crowley traveled the globe with Nixon, soaking in every detail, every nuance of his intellect and capacity for foreign affairs and political strategy. <BR>Concerning posterity, Nixon always knew when he spoke to or with Crowley that he was speaking to history. Nixon has already sought to rewrite his legacy in his memoirs RN as well as In the Arena. Nixon's qualifications are manifest in his own writings as well. Crowley does an excellent job of highlighting Nixon's capacity for political intelligence and machinations while simultaneously showing readers that Nixon is more than a one-dimensional paranoid recluse. Crowley feels obliged to mention Watergate because it figures into Nixon's legacy so prominently but she does not dwell on a low point in an otherwise important career. She also does an excellent job of showing that there are two sides to Nixon: the steely statesman who opened China, diffused tensions with the Soviet Union, and worked toward peace in the middle east (all coauthored with Henry Kissinger) as well as the man behind the myth, saddened by the death of his wife, concerned about the health of his new foreign policy assistant, and full of colorful tales about fellow political personalities from his time in office. It is at this point and at this separation where Nixon comes off as the &quot;grandfather&quot; type that Eisenhower seemed to personify to the average American forty years earlier.	2004-02-07

What role did any right-wing patriot groups play in the Oklahoma City bombing? Where did the federal government come up with their version of events? What really took place on April 19, 1995? Keith illustrates that there are simply more questions than true answers for this issue and there is always more than one set of facts and interpretations. It is understood by law enforcement personnel that eyewitnesses most often don't make particularly good witnesses. However, Keith puts together a pretty convincing argument that there is more to the federal story than meets the eye. Regardless of that premise, and even if every witness and person that was quoted or interviewed in this book was completely wrong, these are still very crucial and important questions that need to be asked. Readers may want to supplement this work with other relevant pieces such as Stephen Jones' &quot;Others Unknown&quot; or &quot;American Terrorist&quot; by Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck.	2004-02-07

Beginning with Voltaire and Barthold Niebuhr and progressing through Macaulay, Jaures, Turner, Trevelyan, Beard, Barzun, and ending with C. Vann Woodward, Stern focuses on different roles history has assumed over a period of thousands of years as well as the various genres and subtopics in which history has made itself a home. These topics include cultural history, economic history, literature, positivism, materialism, scientific history, relativism and others. Stern opens each chapter and discussion of a new historian with insightful preliminary and background information that helps to set the historian in a better context than if it were not to appear. Other than this, his presence is undetectable, which speaks to his ability as a historian himself to remain detached from his work. <br />Any university level historiography course needs this work either as a main text or as a supplementary text given its survey-like nature. Stern opens each chapter and discussion of a new historian with insightful preliminary and background information that helps to set the historian in a better context than if it were not to appear. Each featured historian presents or engages a new variety of history, as the title enunciates, and provides further evidence of the depth and breadth of history as a scholarly subject as well as a process spread out over time. <br />The intense and quite complex nature of the selections make this book a perfect fit for an upper level university or graduate level historiography course. Furthermore, any reader who wishes to supplement any knowledge of history would be well served by this work. High school students intending to pursue history as a major might also read this as a prelude to what lies ahead.	2004-02-07

The trouble the chronology of the students' academic life doesn't change while presidential and congressional administrations do. Jonathan Kozol set out to chronicle and put into words the sights and persons he witnessed and observed in six major school districts. His observations are so shocking and heart wrenching that they must instill in every reader a sense of disgust and despair and evoke poignant and intense questions such as \\"Does that actually happen in America?;\\" \\"How did things get so bad;\\" or \\"What can we do to fix this.\\" Kozol is the proper observer; he tries as often as he can not to directly interfere and change the outcome of his observations. Reading this book will make each reader wonder what kind of divine providence kept him from becoming more involved more often. <BR>Every person who is contemplating a career somewhere in the field of education needs to read this book at least once. The most idealistic people who have the highest and loftiest ambitions and a true burning desire to help children in need will want to read this graphic account of poverty and its correlation to education. Once they wipe away the tears, those potential educators will have a strengthened resolve. Perhaps their actions will enable Kozol to write a new work someday in the future chronicling the uplifting of children and schools.	2004-02-07

Obi Okonkwo takes over the reins from Okonkwo as the chief protagonist and we relive his journey from Mbaino to the court system. Much of what we see in this novel is explicit in what we have seen in political history. Achebe makes no bones about Africa's long political past, or lack thereof at least by its native born black inhabitants, as a contended swath of land many times larger than Europe. British colonial history and colonial rule play into this story significantly for it is through those structures that we become sympathetic of the plight of Obi Okonkwo as well as the unseen thousands of Africans subject to rule as the colony of a European nation. <br />Achebe dissembles the structure of Africanism and allows each reader to be a living, breathing part of this narrative. This quality and writing skill make him essential in any literature or history classroom. Normally, works of fiction are not a proper fit for history courses. However, this work, whether combined with Things Fall Apart or kept alone, will provide an African Studies, African History, or History of Literature course with many topics, some surprisingly contemporary, to discuss.	2004-02-07

There is distinctly absent an editorial interpretation of events or topics covered in this work, which makes it an absolute necessity for future history text writers at the primary or secondary level. They may take an important lesson from the structure and function of this book, that being that students need to see and read things for themselves in order to form a relative and informed opinion about such events. Imagine students at the high school and university levels still believing that Columbus discovered America or George Washington chopped down a cherry tree. Fink's editorial style provides much evidence of the way things ought to be. Fink does not interfere or contradict any of the primary source documents he includes here, therefore the reader will not detect any personal or political bias. <br />The topics covered in this book range from 1875 and the Gilded Age to 1920 and the aftermath of World War I. A wide range of authors are included and various aspects of history, from poetry to stump speech are considered equal. Primary source documents, such as speeches given by big business proponents or political activists are supplemented by lengthier secondary source materials written by university scholars such as Arthur Link and David Kennedy among many others. In this format, students are able to distinguish between what we say happened and what really happened according to documented facts. Thus, students are able to sharpen critical reading and critical thinking skills exponentially by the end of this work. Naturally, the documents themselves will have a personal or political bias, as authors generally exhibit such, but the student's task will be to uncover evidence of such bias while simultaneously extruding facts. <br />This book acts as a perfect follow up to a general American history survey, perhaps even as the requiredtext for a sectional history course having something to do with the Gilded Age and/or Progressive Era. I wholeheartedly recommend the entire Major Problems series as they all allow a reader to perform his job task correctly: read and think critically about the topic at hand.	2004-02-07

He may have written it before he was selected to be the vice-presidential nominee but that does not remove the background purpose of this work. Each time Lieberman contends that he knows what the people want and what would serve them better than what they had previously, he seemingly points to himself and proclaims \\"I'm the man you want.\\" That being said, Lieberman's purpose is justified as his Senate and Connecticut public service record will attest. He is, and continues to be, as we have seen in the 2004 presidential race, a qualified candidate with a unique outlook on issues as well as a set of perspectives and ideas on how to repair issues needed most. <br />He proclaims, controversially,  that he is a religious man yet religion does not interfere with his function as a Senator. We have seen throughout the course of history that this is an arduous task and history will keep Lieberman in its footnotes as evidence of a separation as well as a closeness, however awkward it may seem, of church and state. Lieberman insightfully chronicles his journey from political nobody to Connecticut Attorney General then United States Senator. His observations and career path will provide insight and assistance to any person contemplating a run at political office, regardless of location or desired governmental office. Any reader who seeks a better understanding of Lieberman should find this book helpful as will any readers seeking information the nature and role a Senator can play in the goings on in America.	2004-02-07

When he speaks about China, the world listens. When he speaks about Russia or the Soviet Union, the world listens. The world community, on the whole, is less attuned to correlating the man with the supposed image brought about by the Watergate scandal than most Americans. Consequently, they have lived out the Watergate fantasy most Americans would like to permanently attach to and besmirch Nixon's legacy. History has shown, as much as this book stands as a testament, that Richard Nixon was larger than Watergate and was responsible, either in part with Henry Kissinger and a cabinet of able-minded personalities or in whole, for a great many political and global accomplishments. <br />Nixon's main charge here is that the domestic affairs of America may do more to sink its dominance as the leader of the free world than it will to propel it into the leadership in the coming twenty-first century. America's true challenge as a global dominating force and as a people will not be during wartime but, rather, during a time of peace when we have no one to fight but ourselves. His charge remains poignantly clear in 2004: If we have no foreign enemy to fight, we look toward each other with that same malice. <br />Nixon's insightful analysis as a former president and perhaps the greatest foreign policy president of the 20th century make his work here absolutely qualified and essential to any reader with an interest in political science or governmental affairs.	2004-02-07

His characters are not, outside of their African names, chiefly black or white, Nigerian or Somalian, or polytheist or missionary, more than they are human beings. Few would argue that characters in a book surrounding events occurring on African soil should or even could be separated on a very real basis from their roles as Africans themselves. Yet Achebe has managed to make readers view Okonkwo as a human being, faults or not, and Mbaino or Umuofia as locations larger than being simply known as towns or villages in Nigeria. <br />The journey of Okonkwo is a journey that most human beings embark upon in their lifetimes. From childhood confidence to adulthood faltering, strength from birth to weakness at death, Okonkwo is more than just a Nigerian; he could be any of us. What makes him transcend the barriers of culture and geography is that he need not be black to be important; his experiences as a human make him important because they are very real experiences capable of being experienced by any person, Nigerian or Norwegian, black or white. <br />The culture surrounding Okonkwo is not necessarily or exclusively Nigerian. We may find that such experiences transpired in Chinese cultures or in Native American or First Nations cultures as well as hundreds of other ancient and not-so-ancient cultures and locales. This is the beauty of Okonkwo and his tale. Achebe brings enough of Nigeria to us to make us realize that there is also some part of us in Nigeria.	2004-02-07

A student so inclined may wish to supplement this with any decent world political survey such as Calvocoressi's World Politics. <BR> Kissinger expertly weaves historical detail with insights relative to the globalized horizon. The author's strongest literary quality has always been the length at which he dissects and reconstructs his arguments. Kissinger is not willing to discuss an important political or philosophical topic in one hundred words when it can be dissected and explained without ambiguity and fuzziness in one thousand words. Most strikingly, Kissinger's lengthy discussions do not center on any personal claim or boast. The material discussed at length merely hints at a man whose expert knowledge undoubtedly qualifies him as the proper authority to answer the question posed as the title of this book. <BR> The shame here is much of the book would have undoubtedly been rewritten by the author since the events of September 11, 2001. Nevertheless, it is refreshing to read an account of what the future was intended to be and what it could have been given the historical currents and their future products and dividends as mentioned extensively in this work.	2004-02-07

Richard Langhorne's scholarly look at both the evolution of globalization and some consequences globalization will have on the world's societies serves to enlighten any reader as to the nature and function of the present world. Langhorne does not pull any punches and is clearly not slanted with a political agenda. He is not afraid to deem the United Nations inadequate to deal with global issues but he also does not advocate disbanding the organization; he actually favors a reeducation and repurposing of the organization so that it may be able to do its tasks well. <BR> Langhorne's structuring of this book makes it suitable for any university or graduate level political science or history course. It correlates smoothly with political science, diplomacy studies, and history as well as it does with current events, making it an important read for any reader seeking a background on globalization as a process or structural affair. Its concise and compact nature belie its plethora of information and topics for discussion. Any political science course can spend an entire semester on this book, as can any radio show host or television program. Likewise, it can be part of a greater number or collection of texts on any number of political or historical topics, chief among them British government figures. <BR> This work is indispensable for any reader wishing to understand how we arrived at a globalized world, or, as may be interpreted from this book, how a globalized world arrived at us.	2004-02-07

A teacher not worth his salt can turn an American history class into nap time. Conversely, an engaging teacher can make students interested but part of accomplaishing this objective is complementing the classroom with an equally engaging textbook. The American Pageant is that book. The aesthetic qualities make it appropriate for high school or introductory university level American history courses. The content equally qualifies. There is no doubt that it took 12 editions to make this book even better than it was; progress simply has that deliberate quality. There are aesthetic considerations that can engage those with short attention spans, such as vibrant pictures, humorous cartoons, two column page setting, and explanatory chronologies among others. However, the crowning achievement is that the average reader cannot distinguish where one author stopped writing and another picked up. David Kennedy and Lizabeth Cohen both have their oen distinctive writing styles but they blend magnificently with Bailey's writing in this work. This work is a testament to the love of teaching felt by all three authors.	2004-02-04

However, any user familiar with The American Pageant will not see  a repeat in The American Spirit. Nothing, in the first edition, except the front and back covers is in color and there is a significantly reduced number of pictures and cartoons compared to the American Pageant. Therefore, the work is aesthetically challenged, yet the content, arguably the more important qualification of the book, remains top shelf. The entire content of this work is primary source material culled from a wide gamut of locations. Most of the material found in earlier editions of The American Spirit is either difficult to find or no longer in print and would require an extensive library manhunt to locate. Bailey uses editorials, letters, and essays written by prominent figures such as presidents, first ladies, and other persons directly involved in the historical topics mentioned in this book. The lengths are kept short so they may be supplemental to the same or like topics mentioned in The American Pageant without being burdensome and a chore.

Most university history professors or fellow authors, as well as Bailey himself, consider this the most important work of his literary career. Bailey chronicles the research, writing, and difficulty in finding a publisher for this book in his autobiography, The American Pageant Revisited. The average reader may be overwhelmed with using this daunting volume in a one semester university-level Foreign Policy or Diplomacy course. However, this work is second to none in terms of quality and detail, which make it a highly-sought, highly-used work in such situations. Students as well as instructors may wish to supplement this, or even use this as a supplement, with Thomas Patterson's two-volume American Foreign Policy or the memoirs or official biographies of any relevant figures, especially modern figures such as Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon. More advanced or more interested students may wish to follow up on the sources Bailey uses to comprise the bulk of his narrative.

Any reader must keep in mind that this work is a period piece. The copyright date and publication date is 1966 and Bailey never issued a second edition or addendum. Therefore, this book does not inclde any president or scandal after 1965 and that may be a good thing as this work is not tainted by the Vietnam war or Watergate. Bailey bases his premise on presidential polls ranked by historians but he thoroughly explodes their rankings. In the polls, each president is simply a number. In this book, each president is a cognizant, sentient being. Bailey explains what each president did during his time in office to deserve whatever ranking they were given while further detailing the president in question as a person and the problems faced while serving the nation.

The bulk of this work is Bailey's chronicles as a university instructor and covers each of the universities at which he has been an instructor or professor. Any teacher, whether entering their first day or entering the first day of their thirtieth year, can find a gold mine of professional development material in this book.

What resulted was one of the most comprehensive, insightful, and nonpartisan biographies of the field. Isaacson draws extensively from Kissinger's own memoirs, Years of Upheaval, White House Years, and Years of Renewal, as well as other works written by Kissinger. However, Isaacson also uses other secondary sources written by authors sympathetic and unsympathetic to the former Secretary of State. Yet Isaacson doesn't narrow his focus to any particular period of time in Kissinger's life or career. He details Kissinger's experiences as a university student at Harvard, as a professor there, then as a prominent government figure, then into a full blown public position as National Security Advisor and then Secretary of State. Isaacson does not shy away from controversial topics in or facets of Kissinger's life. He mentions Kissinger's standing as a jet-setter, courting the heads of state and traveling the world, solving, or working to solve, major world problems such as the Vietnam war, the Yom Kippur War, problems with the Soviet Union, and many more. Part of what makes Isaacson's biography a work of quality is his attention to the lesser known events in which Kissinger was a major player. It is up to the reader to judge whether or not Kissinger is biased, manipulative, or any of the other range of qualities, positive or negative, on which Isaacson sheds light. Isaacson, although judgmental at times, simply provides enough material or direction for any reader to make such a choice. It is more than likely that Kissinger is a polarizing figure of such magnitude that any author or biographer simply cannot resist the temptation to judge. Isaacson's work remains, in spite of any judging, a must-have resource for any reader set on inquiring into Kissinger's life and career. It is a very thorough introductory survey of Kissinger despite any shortcomings.	2004-02-04

May shows through the actions and words of prominent figures ranging from literary figures, university presidents, and persons in prominent social positions that the undercurrent for such reform long predated 1919 and significant progress was undertaken to erode and eventually collapse whatever was left of the Victorian era before and during the war. May's work poignantly illustrates that for a person to properly view the Roaring Twenties, he must first begin in the early 1910s. The major difficulty here is that May states that his work lives in the field of cultural history yet he focuses exclusively on prominent persons, mostly well-to-do and powerful, and does not include any reference to the average people. He hints at and points to ordinary citizens but does not afford them the same coverage as the other characters who comprise the bulk of his work. Notwithstanding that sway in focus, this work remains a vital looking glass view into the inception of the post World War I era.	2004-02-03
