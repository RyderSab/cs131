US	17486927	R39EELJSNEFB2V	0064471098	184061428	The Silver Chair	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Charming	Very charming tale into the heart on Narnia.  This is the fifth Narnia book I have read, and one of my favorites, my others being The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and The Magician's Nephew.<br /><br />This tells the story of Eustace returning to Narnia, bringing his friend Jill, and they receive a task from the wonderful Aslan, with the help of Puddleglum, one of my favorite characters.  He is so charming, despite, or because because of, his pessimistic comments. A true comic gem.<br /><br />This book is filled with memorable scenes, such as the guild of Owls, and the truly frightening sequence at the Gentle Giants house, and the underground cities sound truly captivating.<br /><br />A good read, charming and fantastic.  Good allegory, and the message of the children who become lost on their way is a good metaphor for life.<br /><br />Some of the conservative social commentary, and the Witch being a beautiful woman, and the root of all evil, sometimes seem a little too conservatively Christian for me.  But besides that, the Narnia books have a good moral, and good characters doing good things, under the guidance of the great Aslan.<br /><br />The scene where the witch makes them question their belief in Aslan is very powerful, and reminds me of people being questioned in their faith in God, and Goodness.	2005-07-07

I found the characters of Evelyn Nesbit, Harry Houdini, Pierpont Morgan and Henry Ford to be very interesting.  Emma Goldman as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the inventive conversations between historical figures fascinating, particularly the one between Pierpont Morgan and Henry Ford.  It was also really funny.<br /><br />I also found the fictional characters to be interesting.  Coalhouse Walker was interesting, although I am not sure what I think about his transformation.<br /><br />All in all, this was a highly inventinve book, and I recommend it, particularly to people interested in this time period in history.	2005-06-29

For the first half to three quarters I was utterly and completely amazed. The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature.  The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time.  Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.    While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me.  Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it.  I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.    However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character.	2005-06-21

It is so devastatingly tragic and beautiful.<br /><br />It tells the story of a renowned pianist making a stay in a small European town awaiting a performance.  The drama that unfolds is sometimes surreal, but once you let yourself get swept into the rhythm of the book, it starts to make sense, and be meaningful.<br /><br />So many characters who have led lives of timid desperation, looking for a saviour of some sort. The role of the celebrity, of the artist, is also questioned here, as is the religious observation of art.<br /><br />Truly a mind-bending read.  Read it and weep for the heartbreak that is humankind.  Weep for the wounds that we create for ourselves.	2005-05-23

Book is divided into two sections, the first about young Wright in the South, and the second about his experiences as a young man in Chicago.<br /><br />Some brilliant writing, and heart-wrenching sequences when Wright is a young boy, facing the racism of the South, and dealing with poverty.  His love of books and writing is a fascinating journey to watch unfold.<br /><br />For me, the second part, \\"American Hunger\\" was not on the same par as the first, \\"Southern Night.\\"  The focus here was largely on the Communist party, and not as enthralling for me.  Although the revelations of the politics of black communists was interesting.	2005-04-06

Very raw and honest, and eye-opening to the inequalites apparent in the United States today. The poor African-American people who live in the Ida B. Welles housing projects live a life that is like growing up in open warfare with very little hope for the future and enjoyment of the past.<br /><br />The narrators, LeAlan Jones and Lloyd Newman, are very bright and perceptive young men who prove that a child born in the ghetto can still make something out of his life.  The revelation I came away with after reading this is that the children in this world are smart; they just don't have the resources and support that are needed for a child to be fulfilled and happy.  Although the principal we meet in the book is doing her best to provide these children with the education they deserve.<br /><br />These children grow up too fast.  They see things at a young age that no one should see, ever.  Drug deals, shootings, prostitution.  It is so sad.  Conducted in interviews, many memorable characters are come across in this unfortunate housing project.<br /><br />Slavery may be over.  The Civil Rights movement may have happened.  But, really, what is happening here is a form of racism.  Poor black people are stacked in unfordable housing and basically forgotten about by the white establishment of America.  This book is important for drawing attention to these inequalities and the shameful reality of urban American living.<br /><br />Particularly heart-breaking is the story of little Eric Morse, a five year old, who was dropped from a four story window by two eleven year olds.  Heartbreaking.<br /><br />What is truly inspiring is the words of wisdom and hope by narrators LeAlan and Lloyd.	2005-03-23

In The Neverending Story, Michael Ende has created a magical world in the Neverending Story that is a joyful journey to depart upon.  Wonderful fantasy and characters, and also meaning and life lessons.<br /><br />Bastien is a small picked-on boy with a lifesize imagination, who picks up a book called the NEVERENDING STORY, that takes him on a magical adventure. Written in a book within a book format, Bastien soon becomes part of the Neverending Story.  Fantastical characters abound (this is Fantastica after all), Falkor, the luckdragon, Atreyu, the hero Greenskin.  They are all special.  There are even some scary beings in Fantastica, because Fantastica is the land of the imagination, and all beings are special within the imagination, all are equal because they exist.<br /><br />Bastien is chosen for a mission to provide the Childlike Empress with a new name.  With her the fate of Fantastica rests. Bastien is a human, and humans and Fantasticans have always had a precarious relationship.  They need each other, but humans tend to take Fantastica for granted, and deny its existence, making room for lies and delusions in the human world.  Fantastica needs and relies upon the human world, and is taken over by the NOTHING if humans stop believing.<br /><br />Come along with Bastien on his adventures.  You will get sucked in, trust me.  And maybe you will come away a little bit braver, and a little more loving, and more apt to discover the adventures of everyday life, as a human, and also find the way to FANTASTICA!	2004-12-27

It tells the story of a family line condemned to live one hundred years of solitude. But this could be anyone, any family because maybe solitude is a human condition, which is what I came away from the novel with.<br /><br /> What a brilliant book. The loves and lives of this family are so exquisitely told, fusing magic into everyday life, and it is all tied together by the gypsy Melquiades.  Such poetry, such vivid images stick in my imagination, such as the mechanic lover boy who is followed by a cloud of butterflies, and the beautiful woman who lives in a gothic horror house, and the most beautiful woman in the world who ascends to heaven like an angel, and the Colonel who starts wars because of pride, the little gold fishes, the father under an almond tree, babies with pigs tails, the passion and the lack of passion,  you have to read this book to understand all of this, and I guarantee it will change your life.	2004-12-08

Using the analogy of a garden coming to life, and the plants blooming in the springtime, Burnett tells the story of children and people becoming well, and discovering the \\"Magic\\" that is life, or God.<br /><br />  Mary is a sour little girl from India who is orphaned after a sickness hits her Indian town, and she is sent to live with her uncle, Archibold Craven, in Yorkshire, England.  The manor is full of mysteries, as Mary soon discovers.  Along with her new friend Dickon, a boy animal charmer from across the moor, she begins to discover the secrets of the manor and of the gardens that surround it.<br /><br />  This is a beautiful book, just brimming over with life.

What a collection of interesting and sad characters all from the same family, the Glass family. This mainly focuses on the youngest siblings of seven children, Franny and Zooey.<br /><br />  Both are actors, but Franny has come home from college, and is having a sort of breakdown.  The book is divided into two segments, called \\"Franny\\" and \\"Zooey,\\" both focusing on Franny's breakdown, which is of a spiritual nature, and is caused by her aversion to all things being ruled by ego, and false collegiate attitudes, and involves her intonation of a Jesus prayer, over and over.<br /><br />  Both Franny and Zooey have had a precocious upbringing in the Glass family, and were former panelists on a children's whiz kid like radio program.  All the Glass children were former contestants. Zooey believes this upbringing, particularly the religious teachings of their older brothers Buddy and Seymour that has made them \\"freaks.\\"<br /><br />  The dialogue in this book is very clever, and is divided into segments that almost have the quality of theater, beginning with the restaurant scene between Franny and boyfriend Lane, to Zooey's bathroom conversation with Bessie, the matriarch of the Glass family, and I've never heard a son talk to his mother the way Zooey talks to Bessie, and the final confrontations between Franny and Zooey. Salinger also provides biting criticisms of his own characters.<br /><br />  The final religious revelations are interesting, and sweet, and presented in a way that is completely unique.  I would say this is a must read for everyone.	2004-11-16

It was a great story of the strength of women and the bonds of love formed between women coming together. Lily and Rosaleen, the runaways, are likable, and the unique sisters they meet in the Pink House are just as likable, and intriguing.<br /><br />  My only problem with this book is that it is full of little tragedies that always get worked out in a few pages. I don't want to get too into detail here, and give anything away, but sometimes I found some of the resolutions to be unbelievable.<br /><br />  The characters are the best part of this story, and each one is fascinating, my favorites being August, May, Rosaleen, and Zach, and even June. I would recommend this book to young teenage girls, who could identify with Lily.<br /><br />  The strongest theme here is the strength and love of women, represented by Mary, who Lily realizes, has been overlooked in her Sunday School teachings.  Here the sisters worship Mary, and this is an interesting theme for women to find a god who looks like them, rather than a male dominated religion.  Women are awesome, basically, and this book says \\"Yeah they are!!\\"  I would recommend this book to men, as well, who wish to understand women a little more.	2004-10-20

Brutus is the hero of the play, even though it's named Caesar, Caeser is not the main character, more like the unifying force.  Anyway, Brutus is a hertofore honorable soldier brought into the assassination plot by the more sinister Cassius.  Caeser has a god complex, and his right hand man is Mark Antony, who is a party boy turned avenging angel. These are the main characters, rounded out by Octavius Caeser who joins the cast near the end.<br /><br /> Clever dialogue, and thought provoking story make a fascinating read.  This has made a Shakespeare fan out of me.	2004-09-28

The setting is an alternate future where Germany and Japan won WW2.  But this is only the groundwork for a much larger scope.<br /><br />  This world is a very anxious world, and all of the characters seem to exist in a perpetual state of panic and anxiety.  As if their world is upside down or spinning out of control in the wrong direction.  Some scenes are truly horrific.  One gets a sense that there are no clear choices to be made, because the world makes no sense.<br /><br />  Truly unforgettable conclusion; you will just have to read it to find out for yourself.

Hardships along the way, but also many chances for the rabbits to prove their courage.<br /><br />  There really is no way to describe how much I loved this book. If you are looking for a captivating adventure, this is the book for you. It holds you from page one, and each character, though rabbits, and other animals, is very real and defined, with various personality traits that are recognizable in humans. I see this as a fable for humans to follow in some ways on courage and perseverance, and friendship and love.<br /><br />  Good for all ages, this would be a wonderful book for a family our friends to share together.	2004-08-26

The three children are good characters, smart and unique. It is an interesting idea that they have such bad luck, similar to say, an Edward Gorey book.<br /><br />  The villain, Count Olaf, is truly repulsive, and treats the children horribly. Some of my points of contention arise in the segment involving the Count. First of all, it is very hard for me to believe that the children, having many opportunities to do so, would not tell their kind neighbor Justice Strauss how horribly they were being treated by the Count. Intelligent children such as these, I'm sure would know when the help of an outside adult is needed, and it is hard for me to believe that Mr. Poe, the dead parents' friend would not believe them when they tried to tell him. Also I feel this book failed to build up a sufficient amount of suspense.<br /><br />  However, it was interesting, and I am curious to read book two of the series.	2004-08-23

It tells the autobiographical story of Jack Kerouac, who is now forty years old, famous for writing On the Road, and has a problem with alcohol.<br /><br />  Jack in this book, feels he is on the brink of madness. He has a hard time accepting the negative forces in life, such as death, and other people's insanity. He is much too sensitive for the world the way it is. He is a man who loves animals, feels a strong tie to his family, and saves insects. He also loves people very much.<br /><br />  This novel almost seems like a horror novel in the parts where Jack describes his mental anguish. He never wanted to be famous, to be the 'king of the beats' and all he wants is some peace of mind, yet he has people following him around all the time. Even the atmosphere at Big Sur becomes oppressive.<br /><br />  The writing is beautiful and poetic, and hauntingly honest. The book ends with a poem echoing the sounds of the sea at Big Sur.	2004-08-10

It is hard not to have your heart go out to these people, who work in the slaughterhouses, who are mistreated fast food employess, etc. The crimes against humanity at these places are truly despicable.<br /><br />  The history of the fast food empire is truly fascinating, and chilling in its adherance to rampant capitalism. These multinational corporations are the antithesis to what Schlosser sees as the American character, which is one of personal integrity and vision. While the men who started these restaurants may have had these values, they were soon replaced by corporate greed.<br /><br />  The overwhelming sense of this book is the gross violation of human rights in the name of greed and the almighty dollar. Hopefully this book will continue to shed light on the misconduct associated with the fast food intustry, and start the progress of change.	2004-08-02

He is so sweet, caring, and funny, and I love watching his evolution through out the book. Really, I think this is a story of finding your own strength.<br /><br /> All of the citizens of London Underground are colorful and original, Hunter, Door, Old Bailey. And the Marquis who is my personal favorite, who has &quot;created himself as a grand joke.&quot; Read this book if you want to experience something not like anything you've experienced before, if you think there might be more out there than just the daily routine.<br /><br /> Colorful villains, and some scary situations, but also lots of great subtle humor.

It tells the story of a young girl's odyssey through foster homes after her mother is convicted of murder. The writing is beautiful, the characters are astonishing, and I would truly describe this book as a pageturner.<br /><br />  Each of the characters are truly unique and honest, ranging from very pure souls to very dark villains. But no one is one dimensional or a stereotype. They are all very human. Even the mother who is a murderer, is human, even though she follows her own set of rules to dangerous extremes. She is a cold icy woman who worships beauty above truth, who feels that falling in love is a weakness, and is not above lying or even murder. Imagine having a person like this for a mother! And that's just what Astrid has.<br /><br />  This is a story about a daughter, Astrid, coping with life with a mother who is in prison, and going from foster home to foster home, meeting interesting people who change her life, some by befriending her, some by making her life harder. All of this helps her to grow into a young woman. The people she meets are all colorful and original, my favorite being Claire, a truly sensitive soul.<br /><br />  This is also a story of the growth of an artist from puberty to young adulthood, as Astrid is also an artist. Being an artist myself, her artistic discoveries ring completely true. The setting of this book in the Los Angeles area, exposes the wide variety of life living in a particular city. It is obvious the author has a love for Los Angeles.<br /><br />  Above all, this is a story about the bond between mother and daughter, even if mother isn't who you would like her to be. I would recommend this book to anyone, particularly young women and their mothers.	2004-07-23

The characters are so completely detached from their lives, and the bullfight and fiesta serve as an antithesis to their monotonous fleeting lifestyles.  Some of the characters were so downright strange, and almost fake, that it left me with a kind of empty helpless feeling.<br />  First of all, the female character, Brett, is one of the most fascinating characters I have ever read about. Her mannerisms, and life choices are so interesting. She seems very beautiful, and I can see why everyone is is love with her. The male characters are also interesting, the main character being almost emotionless and accepting of his life, although he is in love with Brett, he is happy to just be her friend. You get the feeling that being hurt in the war has really changed him, and made him apathetic, and happy to live vicariously through the bullfight. The character of Cohn is also really interesting, and dark, although the descriptions of him seem a little anti-semitic in this day and age.<br />  The descriptions of the bullfights, and the fiesta in Spain, are truly magnificent, and make me want to go to Spain and see the bullfights, even though I am a longtime vegetarian and animal lover! The descriptions were just that powerful. The character of the bullfighter is also a classic literary character, strong and attractive.<br />  The prose of Hemingway is different than anything I have ever read, and I like it.  He doesn't say much, yet he says a lot. By sticking to the simplicity of a situation, he manages to expose the depth that lies beneath. All in all, I loved this book, and I think it is relavent today, and can be related to anyone who lives their life fleetingly from pleasure to pleasure. A lot of drinking in this book!	2004-07-18

It happens to be dreamlike yet filled with philosophical ponderings at the same time. The story begins by telling the stories of two separate characters. Each character lives in a world that is beautifully realized by Winterson. She manages to express the magic found in everyday life, the good things and the bad things.<br /><br />  The theme deals with love, and passion, and to what lengths people will go for love. In the universe of The Passion, a true test of courage is how much you can love. A really beautiful book with playful prose that can reawaken a passion for life.<br /><br />  The two main characters weave magical stories, the soldier serving Napoleon, describes disgustingly Napoleon's love for chicken, and the girl of Venice, wanderer and adventurer through the city that changes.<br /><br />  Each character is fascinating, yet together I do not think they have much chemistry, and their fate is not what I would have chosen.	2004-07-07

This book was a little disappointing mainly because Meg and Charles Wallace are not featured that often. Most of the book revolves around a historical family, one side bad and one good, and the attempt to go back in time and change the outcome of events in order to prevent war in the present. The time travelling aspect is interesting, and the talking unicorn is very lovable, but I just did not find these historical characters very interesting. Also did not care for the idea that one family line can be inherently bad. Still an enjoyable read, and L'engle has many heartfelt quotations, and Meg's family is still as loving and inspirational. I was also disappointed that Meg has lost her spunkiness. But I guess that is just part of growing up, and she is growing up into a beautiful woman, just like her mother.	2004-06-26
