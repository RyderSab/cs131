Here are the project themes and motifs:<br />A Touch of Country (sheep, cottages, ducks, trees) , Victorian Florals (roses, a bow), The New Arrival (teddy bears, rocking horse, pull duck toy, baby carriage), Special Occasion Borders (birthday cakes, balloons, rosebuds, pumpkins, ghosts, christmas trees, easter baskets, chicks), Floral Alphabet, A Special Day (simple wedding sampler), A Victorian Christmas (candles, sleigh, doorway, wreath), Traditional Borders (vines, roses, chains), Finishing Touches (roses & posies), Antique Bears (teddy bears).<br /><br />It looks like this book was published only in the UK, so it may be hard to find, but it's worth adding to your cross stitch library.  Most designs have little or no backstitching and are quite adaptable for small projects or for creating borders.<br />Now if only there were a book of cross stitch alphabets that was this appealing....	2005-09-07

Her encyclopedia of her life is more topical than a novel or linear prose, but it's :) very easy to pick up & compulsively read.<br />I'm about a decade younger than the author, so some, but not all, of the American pop-culture details resonate.  It would be interesting to see how this catalog reads in twenty years.  \\"Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life\\" is a self-affirming, funny, sometimes tragicomic, read that is a good way to spend the afternoon.<br />I really enjoyed reading about Scholastic book orders (p. 89) which I haven't thought of in probably twenty years.  The instant I read the phrase, a picture of those order forms came strongly to mind.  When I was in school, I used to fight with my parents to get them to order as many books as possible, so I could add to my Scholastic book stash. :)  Never mind the other chances with the RIF program & book fairs.  Thanks for the memories, Ms. Rosenthal-- the minutiae and detritus of your life are my nostalgia (see Red Gingham Tablecloth p. 171). Although, I disagree that one can give too many landmarks when giving directions.  On most entries I've been nodding, but when it comes to giving or getting directions, too much is better than too little.  Unless brief directions are given with the director's phone number.	2005-05-11

What do you get when a ex-secretary who loves couture shoes and is obsessed with her highlights becomes one of the Undead?  Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Taylor.  Although having dogs trail her around town and men fall instantly in lust with her is kind of a nuisance, Betsy just wants to return to her recently-vacated life and steer clear of Vampire politics.  But after several of her fellow Undead decide she is their long-prophesied Queen Betsy must wade into the fray.<br />Undead and Unwed is one of the funniest comedic novels I have read in a good while.  Mary Janice Davidson constantly riffs with great one-liners, repartee, and strong supporting characters.  Her touch is both proficient and deft-- With \\"Undead and Unwed\\" she has established herself as a luminary of this Chick Lit/Vamp(?) genre.  If you are looking for a lively, Laugh-Out-Loud series, look no further. I'm definitely glad there's already another title out in this series.	2004-10-06

In \\"The Good Earth\\" winner of the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, Wang Lung marries a village girl O-Lan in an arrangement made by his father.  O-lan is steady, faithful, & hard-working: everything that makes up a Good Wife.  The Good Earth chronicles how Wang Lung & O-Lan form a family: raising several children & wresting a living through farming rice & other crops.  Wang Lung & O-Lan go through lean and full years, but their marriage is threatened when Wang-Lung meets Lotus Blossom, a tea-shop girl in town....<br /><br />I think O-Lan is one of the greatest heroines in literature.  And the setting of this story and Chinese culture are just so interesting: the agrarian livelihood of the Lung family and how their fortunes depend on good harvests.  Buck deals with the capriciousness of fortune and love, as Wang Lung's eyes wander from his wife to other women.  I highly recommend \\"The Good Earth\\" and Pearl S. Buck's other novels, especially \\"Imperial Woman\\".  In fact, Pearl S. Buck's life as a daughter of missionaries informs most of her novels set in China & is well worth reading about.  Thanks go to Oprah for choosing \\"The Good Earth\\" as her latest book club selection.  It is a novel that is entirely unique and unforgettable.	2004-09-16

In Emily Ann Croom's \\"The Sleuth Book of Genealogists\\" she invokes the detective methods of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot & Miss Marple, & other classic sleuths like Sherlock Holmes, to refine your detecting and analytical skills in genealogical research.  The analogy is dead on (no pun intended : p ) & a lot of fun to follow.<br /><br />Chapters in the book (because I appreciate it when other reviewers do this) are:<br /><br />(1) Putting a Down Payment on Success<br /><br />(2) Planning for Research<br /><br />(3) Broadening the Scope: Cluster Genealogy<br /><br />(4) Documenting Research<br /><br />(5) Gathering Information Research<br /><br />(6) Examining Evidence: The Gray Cells in Action<br /><br />(7) Arranging Ideas: Progress Reports<br /><br />(8) Reporting: Case Solved<br /><br />(9) Finding the Parent Generation: The Search for Isaac Heldreth's Parents [case study]<br /><br />(10) Finding Slave Ancestors: The Search for the Family of Archie Davis, Sr. [case study]<br /><br />(11) Finding the Parent Generation: The Search for Ann (Robertson) Croom's Parents [case study]<br /><br />I highly recommend reading chapter 6, which is the genealogical skill level that I'm working on.<br /><br />Now as Holmes is quoted on page 190, \\"Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise, and stated as baldly as possible.\\"<br /><br />This book is a great primer for moving beyond basic census, marriage, & probate research into evaluation of records for subtle clues & steps for further exploration.<br /><br />Best of luck on your family research.	2004-09-03

Like Harry, eleven year-old Lyra Bellaqua is well-known to others as being destined to do great things.  Her parents were nobles who took Lyra to Jordan College, Oxford as a child to be raised by the scholars there.<br />So Lyra has lived a sort of mongrel childhood.  Knowing of her privileged background, but being little supervised by the college scholars she has grown up running wild with the other children of the college and Oxford town.<br />Before long her Uncle Asriel reappears at the college, stirring up controversy with his claims of new discoveries in the North and, after flying back there, he is captured by the fierce panserborne, or armor-wearing polar bears. Lyra must go on a journey of her own to free him and discover the truth about his claims.<br />I loved this first book in Pullman's \\"Dark Materials\\" series and am now in the middle of his second book \\"The Subtle Knife\\".  I enjoyed all the details of this story: the alethiometer (or golden compass), the daemons and different species of people, and the alternate world.<br />Phillip Pullman is great at writing dramatic, nail-biting scenes. This book is a pageturner and the series is already a classic.  Can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.<br />However, I must say that I didn't understand the evocation of biblical imagery at the end of the novel.  I'm not sure how it will come up again or tie into the series' major themes, but it kind of cropped up in a kind of \\"Huh? Come again?\\" suddenness.  Although some reviewers have compared this series to a revisionist Paradise Lost, I hope it doesn't turn out that way.<br />If you're looking for other books like this, check out Gail Carson Levine's Ella Enchanted and Robin McKinley's Beauty: A Retelling of Beauty and the Beast.  Garth Nix's Sabriel series may also be of interest.	2004-08-30

In fact, Christopher is unable to process or handle emotions, but he is a three-dimensional character in spite of this, able to operate in the world and describe it quite beautifully and sometimes humorously.  This is definitely a character-driven story and one easily follows Christopher as he tracks down the killer of his neighbor's dog.  I loved the quotes and stories mentioned throughout the novel.  What's best about this story is that it starts as an off-beat mystery, but ends as so much more.<br /><br />That being said, I didn't particularly like the ending, but when 4/5 of the book is so original and startling, it's worth the trip, even if the end is perfunctory and open-ended.	2004-08-30

Soon her father, six brothers, and she are ensorcelled by her new stepmother.<br />I didn't know what to expect when I started this novel, but it was a really good read.  But you'll want to keep out the Kleenex box for this one.  The story is unusually sad and wistful as Sorcha goes through all sorts of deprivations as she is separated from her family and works to break her stepmother's spell.<br />The atmosphere of the Erin/Ireland, descriptions of the forest, druids, &amp; nature worship by Sorcha's family was an absorbing backdrop. Ever since Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series I've enjoyed reading about medieval medicine and herbology, which this heroine practices.  And like Gabaldon's novels, this is an extensive story coming in at 560 pages.<br />I admire authors when they aren't afraid to damage the main characters &amp; this is no different.  There are some well-done plot twists.  Although, from time to time one can tell Ms. Marillier is a new novelist, Daughter of the Forest is a memorable and accomplished first effort.  I would rate it 4 &amp; 1/2 stars.	2004-04-13

Vicky Bliss is a methodical detective much like Mary Russell from the Laurie R. King series.  In \\"Street of the Five Moons\\", Vicky meets her match in \\"John Smythe\\", secretary to a nobleman and art collector, who strongly resembles Dorothy L. Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey.  His playful evasiveness is a delightful foil for Vicky's determination.  Peters describes Germany and Italy like she's a longtime resident and makes clever allusions to more than a few literary classics.<br />\\"Street of the Five Moons\\", like many series' second books, seems stronger than the first installment and has more compelling characters.  Vicky's asides to the reader are also a fun device.  I look forward to finishing this series and strongly recommend \\"Street of the Five Moons\\".	2004-04-06

To the Nines is so deftly executed.  This series just keeps getting stronger and this installment has lots to recommend it.<br />In To the Nines Stephanie, Lula, and Connie fly to Las Vegas to kick some fugitive butt.  The best part about the Vegas trip is that it doesn't forestall Stephanie's significant relationships, but is a mini-break in the book and gives Lula a chance to live large(r than usual.)  Morelli and Ranger are present through at least three-fourths of the book to watch Stephanie's back in Jersey, engage her in wittily suggestive and affectionate repartee, loan cars, and provide bodyguard service.  Rounding out the cast of characters are Morelli's mother and Grandma Bella, who more then compensate for a lack of funerals.  Also included are healthy servings of Stephanie's family (with the expectant Valerie, kids, and Albert Kloughn) during dinnertimes.<br />Clean writing, setting-appropriate dialogue, not to mention Stephanie's quality time with Morelli and some with Ranger make this book one of the best of the series.  Five stars!	2004-03-09

I'm a lefty, so I'm always looking for clear left-handed instructions.  I had to flip back and forth between the pages with instructions for righties & lefties, but it wasn't too difficult to figure out.  I'd give the lefty knitting instructions a four out of five for simplicity.<br />For those who are trying to learn how to knit, your first few rows of knitting will be very loose-- that doesn't mean you're doing it wrong.  I kept pulling out my stitches & starting over, because I thought I wasn't knitting correctly.  Just keep going & you'll see your project take shape.  Also, try to incorporate any excessive slack yarn between your needles into your stitches; if you're not stitching to the end of a row, a big loop of yarn may end up in the middle of your project.<br />I'm not a fan of the asymetrical hems featured on some of the sweaters and vests, but the scarves are easy and fun.  I've made about four of the patterns so far & am getting ready to knit the fabulous \\"Einstein coat\\".  This book features luxurious yarns that prompted me to try working with a yarn other than acrylic.  Now I love novelty yarns.  Thanks Sally Melville!	2004-02-18

The plot thickens when a body is found in their koi pool the next day.<br />In my opinion, \\"Dead Girls\\" read more quickly than the first Blackbird Sister mystery \\"How to Murder a Millionaire.\\"<br />I looove the knowledge and references to Philadelphia high society rules and parties in this series.  The sister's characterizations are nuanced; Mafia don's prodigal son Michael Abruzzo sizzles as Nora's on-again, off-again romantic interest. This is a fun, light-hearted romp through Philadelphia social soirees.  Nancy Martin's series is as much fun as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  Highly recommended.	2004-01-26

When housecleaner Lily Bard discovers a body in her gym, Body Time, she sees a connection to earlier murders that have taken place in her adopted town, Shakespeare, Arkansas. Lily Bard moved to Shakespeare several years before to restart her life after a personal tragedy received national media attention, but her life since then has been anything but quiet. After stopping an interracial fight at a local drive-in Lily becomes the focus of unwanted attention by some of the town residents. She decides not to move, but instead to stay and try to solve the murders that have made living in Shakespeare difficult for many of its citizens.<br />Charlaine Harris has a more complex plot structure in \\"Shakespeare's Champion\\". Events go back and forth in time and details are revealed from Lily's former life.  And Lily really develops as a character in this book: when big things go down in Shakespeare Lily is forced to make crucial decisions that show what she's made of. This is also the book where she meets Jack Leeds. ; )<br />This is my favorite Lily Bard installment yet. Charlaine Harris uses an economy of words that makes every narrative detail important. I love the names she chooses for characters and businesses, but for all those whimsical details her stories are streamlined and focused.<br />If you've started the Lily Bard series that begins with \\"Shakespeare's Landlord\\", be sure to read \\"Shakespeare's Champion\\". Harris' other series are also a lot of fun.<br />And if you like Harris' writing be sure to try Elizabeth Peters' and Laurie R. King's mystery series.	2003-01-26

The story opens with Aurora Teagarden attending weddings for both her mother and Arthur Smith and the funeral of Jane Engle.  Aurora then inherits Jane's house and finds a sinister surprise inside.<br />Aurora, as always, has lots of character detail and internal dialogue (love her hair : &gt;), but<br />I was disappointed to find little charactization for benefactress and Real Murders ex-cohort Jane Engle.  There was also little sleuthing in this story.  Aurora gets to know her new neighbors through a couple of social events, but does not beat the street to try to solve the mystery.  This installment shares the great atmosphere and the small-town setting with the rest of the series, but I didn't buy the mechanics of the story.  Neither did I appreciate that Jane Engle just &quot;didn't have time&quot; to put things back the way she found them.<br />&quot;A Bone to Pick&quot; is effective in that it made me want to read the rest of the series, but mostly to fill in the blanks this story leaves and see if Harris' characterizations develop further.	2003-01-01

She has such a unique voice I look forward to each new story with great anticipation.<br />Although the plots of \\"The Indiscretion\\" and \\"The Proposition\\" were noticeably discursive, the clever dialogue and Ms. Ivory's writing style were masterful enough to carry me through those stories.  Not so in this case.<br />\\"Untie My Heart\\" starts promisingly when plucky sheep farmer Emma Hotchkiss determines to settle the score, by fair means or foul, with a condescending viscount who runs over a valuable lamb but refuses to pay restitution.<br />However, this story loses its tension and mystery when Stuart, the viscount, and Emma finally confront each other. After some of the intimate scenes I was left thinking \\"????\\"<br />And some of the plot devices were dropped, such as Stuart's houseguests, why he arrived from Russia, and the bank account that Emma fraudulently opened. More importantly, I didn't feel that Stuart's feelings about his family were resolved, particularly in regards to his father's proclivities and his mother's love.  The story just never built-- at some points it was bizarre, at other times, haphazard.  I was left feeling strangely unsettled and dissatisfied after finishing this story.<br />Mick from \\"The Proposition\\" was a wonderful, fully realized hero-- Stuart is a paler version of him.  \\"Proposition\\" also had some great plot twists, this story does not.<br />For me, \\"Untie My Heart\\" lost direction and drive about one-fourths of the way through the narrative.  Sorry to say I was truly disappointed in this latest effort by Judith Ivory.<br />For better examples of Ms. Ivory's writing talent I highly recommend \\"Starlit Surrender\\" as well as her titles \\"Bliss\\", \\"Dance\\", \\"Beast\\" and \\"The Proposition\\".	2002-12-21

I put off reading 'Last Chance Saloon' because it features multiple heroines, which is not a type of plot structure I usually like.<br />But I was surprised to find that this novel is as good as any of Keyes' previous novels, even, I think, better.<br />Ms. Keyes juggles the various storylines of her heroines adeptly, moving the action along consistently for each character.<br />I would have rated this novel five stars, except the ending kind of petered out as it became focused on one character.<br />Marian Keyes' voice is so distinctive; there are no other authors with similar style.  Although she is Irish, her novels do not closely resemble the popular wave of Brit chick lit or Singleton novels.  Her wry sense of humor always makes me laugh.  Each novel I have read I consider time well spent.  And 'Last Chance Saloon' I didn't find as darkly humorous as her previous novels, perhaps because there are multiple characters.<br />I highly recommend 'Last Chance Saloon' and all of Marian Keyes' novels that precede it.<br />Because this novel was especially good I give it four &amp; a half stars.<br />I look forward to her next novel coming out.	2002-08-07

And it's not as if there's not a certain cachet to working for uber-rich New Yorkers.  Give me a break.<br />But the novel is often clever and certainly amusing, if more than a touch over the top.

Sookie became endebted to Bill's vampire associates and has now been hired out by them to a Dallas vampire coven to help them find a missing vamp.  Bill travels with her as her protector and entree to their world.<br />I really enjoyed reading 'Living Dead in Dallas'.  It is a solid continuation of the series.  Sookie Stackhouse's character had some interesting nuances emerge.<br />There were a few disappointments.  The vampire world, having been in existence for centuries, comes across as having an amateurish organization.  I was also surprised to see the lack of a resolution to Sookie's dealings with the bellhop, Barry.<br />This series will draw inevitable comparisons with Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series.  Almost without exception, Hamilton's Anita Blake novels are faster-paced and more dimensional.  However, these two Sookie books are charming, funny, and notably down-to-earth.

Usually, I'm a big, big fan of Crusie's work but the partner-switching element in \\"Fast Women\\" first and foremost put me off this story. Secondly, Nell's conversation with her ex-husband in the diner, with interjections from her friends, also stood out as distasteful.  For me, Fast Women lacks likeable characters. I found heroine Nell Dysart's decisions to be improbable and unrealistic. She and Gabe constantly fought and their relationship came across as requisite and trite.<br />A lot of readers enjoy the comic dialogue in Jennifer Crusie's novels.  The comedy is here in this novel, but the action just plays too fast and loose with too many characters for my taste. You may not find it so.<br />I wanted to like \\"Fast Women\\" and have thoroughly enjoyed reading most of Jennifer Crusie's back titles, but this time around I thought the chemistry between the two main characters was noticeably forced and not enjoyable. I highly recommend Crusie's earlier titles, especially \\"The Cinderella Deal\\" and \\"Tell Me Lies\\" as fresh, funny, and delightful.	2002-06-26

Charlaine Harris offers up an original and fun vampire novel with 'Dead Until Dark'.<br />Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress in a small contemporary Louisiana town, has led her life trying to protect herself from &quot;her disability&quot;-- a telepathic skill so acute she finds it difficult to block out the thoughts of those around her.<br />One night when a vampire named Bill enters the bar Sookie is immediately drawn him.  He's set apart from people just like she is and she's delighted to discover she can't overhear his thoughts at all.  He likewise is surprised he cannot hypnotize her with his power.  They find themselves in the awkward position of meeting on almost equal ground.  When citizens of the town start showing up murdered, Sookie enlists Bill's help.<br />The style of 'Dead Until Dark' really reminds me of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  'Dead Until Dark' is a first person narrative and takes place in an area where everybody knows each other.  Sookie also has a grandma who's a character.  Sookie is, well, kind of goofy.  Her talent for hiding her telepathy is about as great as Evanovich's Stephanie Plum's skill as a bounty hunter.<br />Bill is rather a &quot;thinking&quot; comtemplative vampire, similar to Anne Rice's Louis, except he accepts himself for what he is.  He doesn't reveal much of his past which, no doubt, will unwrap in later installments.<br />Charlaine Harris portrays the vampire world to be as violent as that portrayed by Laurell K. Hamilton.  However, Sookie Stackhouse is no Anita Blake.  The novel does slow somewhat in the middle and wraps up rather peremptorily.  However, 'Dead Until Dark' is an engaging take on 'life with vampires' and has consistent style. And Sookie is a fun character.<br />I look forward to Sookie &amp; Bill developing more as characters in future installments and seeing their relationship grow.	2002-05-29

Golddigging Bodicea Lashley tells her story of living off of men's favors and shares her hard and fast rules for golddigging. She has defined an age window of between 20-30 years old to secure her future and land a man with big \\"bank.\\"<br />Of particular fun are the Indian-American monikers Bodacia coins for the other golddiggers: Travels With Men; No Deposit, No Return; Operation: I Do; and Every Little Bit Helps. I enjoyed the smart relationship between Bodicea and her best friend Napoleon.<br />The tight plot for Millennium Girl gets an extra big thanks for not being predictable; Bodicea's ultimate fate is anybody's guess. Will she land her Walletman or overplay her hand? Felske does not tip us off.<br />Bodicea jumps off the page as one of the strongest and most sure-footed heroines I have seen in a long while. Felske creates a heroine with formidable savvy and wit. I was amazed at how well Felske channels the voice and perspective of a twenty-seven year old woman. Wow. I thought that the human interactions played out realistically...except for Bo's relationship with her sister and with Jasper at the end of the story.<br />I was going to give this story four stars: even though this book has a strong showing the ending is uneven and bumpy. But on reflection, Bodicea's luminescent hotel harangue puts this story over the top for me. There are moments of sheer brilliance in this story-- I look forward to reading Coerte Felske's backlist.  I recently read Franzen's The Corrections. In comparison, The Millennium Girl came off as just more effortlessly brilliant to me and with better pacing.<br />This novel is similar to Jay McInerney's '80s timepiece Story of My Life. If you like one you'll enjoy the other.	2002-05-01

This novel follows the Brit singleton formula that has developed from Helen Fielding's \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\". It's the closest novel I've read to the two Bridget Jones' novels.<br />It makes for a great beach read and pageturner. You know that the tribulations of Becca Bloomwood will turn around-- and they do very quickly. High marks for making Luke Brandon an appealing and mysterious character.<br />My main problems with 'Confessions' are its predictable and unrealistic plot. But this is a charming story with a tight plot; I couldn't put it down. If you want to laugh uproarously about someone's shopping sprees and credit card woes this is the story. I look forward to reading more novels by Sophie Kinsella.	2002-04-28

Most modern writers who write Fiction remind me of part of a W.H. Auden poem: \\"...existentialists declare/That they are in complete despair,/ yet go on writing.\\" In college I found modern lit to be both morbidly depressing and excruciatingly tedious. This novel was actually very compulsively readable. It was easy to slip into.<br />The major themes strongly reminded me of Don DeLillo's White Noise: academia, pharmaceuticals, modern family life, consumer culture, just no Hitler studies. But the satire is in the same tenor. It struck me as witty and incisive.<br />I would like to have seen more of a post-Christmas follow-up for Denise and especially Gary. I liked Alfred, like Franzen meant for us to, but felt like Alfred was missing some characterization.<br />And some of the streams of consciousness you had to go back and re-read, but there weren't many. Wickedly clever, Not politically correct: Just someone try to apply political correctness to a novel all about Corrections. Good fun.	2002-04-03

When I read a title from her Mary Russell series I always learn something intriguing about Greek, Hebrew or linguistics.<br />The plot for 'A Letter of Mary' could be written on a flea, as Herman Melville would say. The plot and its twists and turns aren't exciting or broad in scope. It is the mind's eye of Mary Russell that pulls me along. She is a fabulous protagonist and King's depiction of her is unerring.<br />Four stars for a great trip.	2002-02-18

Lord of Fire initially looks like its going to reach the par set by the Ascension series, but it misses the mark.<br />There are things I loved about this book, notably, the underworld setting at Revell Court. The initial meeting of Lucien and Alice sets the reader up for high expectations. However, as the story progresses, Alice's ad nauseam purity and unselfishness and the artificial virgin vs. [bad girl], Alice vs. Caro, dichotomy just set my teeth on edge.<br />After pulling an all-nighter to read this book with great anticipation, I had to conclude after the first few chapters that this story was painted in too-broad strokes of black & white, good & evil. Just very one-dimensional characters.<br />In some storylines, authors manage to get away with dogmatic characterizations of heroes and villains. Unfortunately, this is not one of those times. Everyone's characterization just flattened out into stock cliches. I kept flipping the pages in vain, looking for someone to surprise me.<br />I love Ms. Foley's writing style. But, in this case, it wasn't enough to make the story enjoyable for me.	2002-02-03

I wrote Feehan's Carpathian series off until I read Dark Fire.  This installment is the freshest entry I've read in Feehan's series.  Feehan basically stays with the stock Carpathian plotline, but makes the heroine more astute and candid.  In other words, the heroine takes one look at the Carpathian lifestyle, sees her own place in it, and makes a few serious attempts to run away.<br />I enjoyed the aspects of Darius' and Tempest's relationship that Feehan chose to emphasize.  One of my favorite components was that Darius had to act according to his own instincts and wonder if he was doing the right thing, since he was not raised by Carpathians and did not know their ways. Self-doubt is a realistic feeling.  Kudos.<br />His attitude of &quot;My wish is your command&quot; is a bit over the top, but that's all part of this series.<br />This installment is worth your money.  A fresh and invigorated entry in the Carpathian series.	2002-01-31

However, Dark Legend reminds me of all the things I dislike about this series.  If I hadn't have read Dark Fire, my disgust would be total. The plotline for Dark Legend returns to the same type of Stephanie Laurens-like cookie cutter plotline and conflict as the other \\"Dark\\" books.<br />This time around, I was struck by the hypocrisy of exalting the Carpathian race. Carpathians suck humans' blood against their will and an extremely high percentage of the males become murderous vampires. The Carpathian hunter cult started to look appealing.<br />I saw the movie Kate & Leopold over Christmas and the secretary in it was reading \\"Dark Challenge\\". I recognized it and laughed and then I thought, \\"Why that book? Why didn't they product place a more creative romance like a Jennifer Crusie or Laurell K. Hamilton?\\" I see how the romance genre comes by its sometimes deserved reputation.	2002-01-29

Laurie R. King has a wonderfully nuanced voice.  I'll admit I usually enjoy first person narratives with female protagonists. Mary Russell is one of the great protagonists.<br />It's refreshing how Laurie R. King emphasizes Mary Russell's rational, logical intellect.  Kudos.  Sherlock Holmes has met his counterpart in Mary Russell.  I enjoyed the growing relationship between Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes (Please note this story is not a romance.).  I particularly enjoyed the format of the novel with a number of cases, rather than just one.  That format effectively charts the development of the characters.<br />However, in the story, Holmes was portrayed as a brilliant and empathetic person.  I didn't think it realistic that his intellectual arrogance would be tempered by a high degree of empathy. In my experience, that's not very common. Maybe he shows understated empathy.  King does drop enough clues late in the book for the reader to piece together the identity of the villain.  But the hints are deliberate and do not detract from the storytelling.<br />I've read the second book in the series, A Monstrous Regiment of Women and liked it almost as well as this one. This novel, set for the most part in Britain, uses British language and spelling. If you like Agatha Christie's mysteries you will like Laurie R. King's.<br />Thanks Ms. King for adding a fresh, feminist perspective to the the Sherlock Holmes canon!	2002-01-23

This is my favorite of the three Marian Keyes novels I've read.<br />  Keyes' humor is a little dark, but quirky and uncompromising.  She's great at describing real life frustrations. Her heroines are always strong and have a warped sense of humor.  I love the introduction to Claire's family.  Helen is hilarious, and even though she may make a better secondary character, I hope she gets a book of her own.  Every character in Claire's family is wonderfully drawn.<br />However, I could not understand why Claire's husband, James, had an affair and acted as he did.  I didn't feel like I understood his character or motivations at all.  At least if he's going to act like a jerk, have the reason be fairly credible.<br />I am seeing a trend where Marian Keyes' stories follow the same basic storyline.  Fairly attractive heroine involved in crisis, must rebuild her life or meet challenge.  Her life and the people in it no longer look the same.  Everpresent male friend/boyfriend eventually steps forward for relationship.  Heroine renews life.<br />This story is a pageturner, but still in the Marian Keyes way-- predictable.  And I don't always appreciate Keyes' humor, which is sometimes too wry for me.<br />If you like this storyline check out the 1986 movie Heartburn with Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson.<br />Autobiographical novel is by Nora Ephron, who was briefly married to and had two sons with Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame.  Deftly directed by Mike Nichols.  Kevin Spacey can also be spotted in his first feature film role.	2001-12-16

I am tired of repetitive romantic suspense.  Thanks for not going there.<br />I wasn't able to get through 'Dream a Little Dream' a few years ago.  I thought, &quot;A Drive-In Movie Theater?? What is this??&quot;  But I came back to it, because someone told me that Gabe was Cal's older brother.<br />This isn't a poorly written story-- it's just different from what she usually writes.  It's not as comic and the heroine is in dire, very pitiful circumstances.  You do feel the Rachel's and Gabe's pain, especially Rachel, who just couldn't catch a break.  I couldn't really warm to Edward, because he was so passive in the first half of the book.  And I was sorry to see Phillips resort to cheap devices to manipulate her readers' emotions with the transparent &quot;Are we going to die?&quot; comments, etc.  But, all in all, a strong effort with a lot of heart.  I became very involved in the story after the first hundred pages or so.	2001-12-04

All of the characteristics of Crusie's work are here: the irreverent tone, clever dialogue, and some sizzling comebacks. And the strands of the plot show promise for coming together in a comic and satisfying way. But they don't. There are various contrivances that don't work, but could have. The momentum for the story just isn't there. Jennifer Crusie tries to coast along on sharp dialogue, but the main characters need to be developed more. They don't have enough details to make them likeable or keep us interested and there are too many characters without redeeming qualities.<br /><br />This story lacks a basic sweetness; some scenes are just plain raunchy. However, there are some laugh-out-loud dialogue and comic scenes. On that basis I marginally recommend this book.  Tell Me Lies and The Cinderella Deal are stellar, but this one falls short of the standard that Jennifer Crusie has set with her previous novels.	2001-12-03

She shows great mastery of the genre.<br /><br />With \\"True Confessions\\" she writes an original story.  And in Gospel, Idaho she's created one doozy of a small town.  Wary of outsiders, Gospel citizens are Wrangler-wearing, honky-tonk loving, gun-toting, unrepentant cowpunchers.  Tabloid reporter Hope Spenser drives into Gospel in her silver Porsche with her turquoise Tony Lamas, trying to get a little R & R and break her writer's block.  She finds something more than that.<br />The town sheriff, Dylan Taber, without trying, is \\"breaking the hearts of good women\\" everywhere.  But he's just trying to keep the peace and raise an eight year old on his own.<br />These two have very adult problems (Thanks Rachel Gibson!) but are drawn together in spite of themselves. Great sizzle throughout and mature handling of the storyline.<br />To take a break from real-life worries, I recommend \\"True Confessions\\" to rejuvenate and renew.	2001-09-22

She sets it in 1902 among the New York elite. One young woman from a well-connected, prominent New York family, Francesca Cahill, doesn't want to be married off. She has secretly enrolled herself in Barnard College and works to reform the social ills of New York (somewhat reminiscent of Jude Devereux's Temptation). It makes for an interesting premise that doesn't work so well on paper. I didn't warm to Francesca Cahill--  she was forever crashing into the middle of tense scenes, bungling police operations (although she did ultimately help the investigation). That kind of headstrong naivete is not a pleasure to read, especially in a mystery. And, yes, I think that kind of characterization insults readers' intelligence. But, yes, Francesca might mature in the books to follow. I hope she does.<br /> I also did not like how one woman, who was supposed to be sympathetic, had committed adultry with half the men in New York. Sometimes Brenda Joyce creates characters who are hard to like. Warning: This novel is not a romance, but was marketed as one to pick up Brenda Joyce's romance readership. There are hints of romantic feeling, but that's it. So, Five stars for the interesting setting.<br /> Five stars for the historical detail.<br /> Three stars for the characters.<br /> Plot, eh, three stars. Recommended for a quick one-time, one-night read. For better romantic suspense try Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series, J.D. Robb's &quot;in Death&quot; series, and Dianne Day's &quot;Fremont Jones&quot; series. Anne Perry also sets her mysteries in the Victorian period in England.	2001-08-27

Helene Craig comes from the wrong side of the tracks in rural Alabama. They see each other on the streets of Paris and they have that prescient recognition, \\"love at first sight\\"-- and their story begins. Edouard and Helene, seemingly worlds apart, come together with a sense of inevitability.<br />This book is not a romance, though a love story is one of the novel's central features. The plot takes place in Europe and America with events transpiring from 1959 to 1975. The plot lags when Edouard and Helene are separated and there is a certain \\"ick\\" factor to the plot-- which is there for I don't know what reason. But the love story is like no other.<br />Ms. Beauman is often compared to Sidney Sheldon, with her glittering world of jetsetting characters, rightly so. But Destiny has a better love story than ones you find in Sheldon's novels.	2001-08-20

This love story reads a lot like a chess match. The heroine makes a move; the hero makes a counter move.  They argue with logic.  This story is a battle of wills.  Watching the hero & heroine circle each other is so much fun.  Just when I thought the the story was going to take a turn for the worse, it doesn't.  The uncle is a little weak, but you have to have a villain.<br />Ms. Jeffries never underestimates the intelligence of her readers.  This is a well-written and enjoyable romance. I'm rating this romance four stars, because while it was a sizzling pageturner, it didn't have that certain snap that makes a romance irresistable.

I guffawed at several passages (especially the scene involving a box of condoms). Linda Howard is one of the few romance writers who is an &quot;auto-buy&quot; for me.  She never disappoints....Although, I'm rating this title four stars, because, I don't think Open Season ranks among the best she's written.  I would have liked a little more characterization of the main characters. But Open Season's still darn good.  I very much enjoy reading Ms. Howard's analysis and observations of nonverbal language that is part of her narrative voice. Running into those small gems are one of the joys of being a reader.<br />Linda Howard is much like Susan Elizabeth Phillips on an ordinary day: reliably good.  Always deft and always satisfying.<br />The small town setting of Hillsboro, Alabama are reminiscent of Linda Howard's earlier After the Night and Jennifer Crusie's hilarious Tell Me Lies and The Cinderella Deal.

Houghton Mifflin did a disservice to this novel by putting a false sticker on the cover calling The Wind Done Gone \\"an Unauthorized Parody\\".  It's NOT one...<br />A parody, according to Merriam-Webster's, is: \\"a humorous or satirical imitation\\".  This novel is neither humorous or satirical in tone, nor is it a simple copying of Gone With the Wind.<br />Like Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea is a revisioning of Jane Eyre from the perspective of Edward Rochester's \\"mad\\" wife so is The Wind Done Gone a revisioning of Gone With the Wind from a slave's perspective with the creation of a mixed-race half-sister for plantation belle \\"Other\\".<br />This book stands on its own as a novel of significance.  The Wind Done Gone is the fictionalized journal of Cynara, the daughter of a plantation farmer and the plantation's black Mammy.  Cynara's life has been defined by what was denied her, growing up as Other's unacknowledged half-sister; shunted aside by her mother Mammy who dotes on Other, and being sold off the plantation as a young girl because Other becomes jealous of her.<br />R., a rogueish Southern gentlemen, it turns out, is someone Cynara met before Other, but makes the mistake of whetting R.'s interest in Other by telling R. about her. After R. and Other's daughter dies and he leaves Other, he returns to Cynara and sets up a house for her.  But the ghost of Other and Cynara's history is always between them.<br />Alice Randall dwells on the hidden and unspoken truths of Southern gentility: the unacknowledged alliances and relationships between men of power and colored women, the unrecognized mixed-race children, and the crutch of slavery for the antebellum South.<br />  Ms. Randall's points especially hit home in the familiar framework of Gone With the Wind.<br />After reading both Gone With the Wind and The Wind Done Gone, I don't prefer one novel over the other: I think that both viewpoints co-exist and that taken together they encapsulate  the charm, hypocrisy, and inter-relationships of the South.  Both are riveting stories.  The Wind Done Gone is a much shorter novel, but Cynara's narrative voice and the detailed writing are excellent.<br />In my opinion, The Wind Done Gone will be studied as an alternative vision to Gone With the Wind.<br />If you like The Wind Done Gone, I recommend Wide Sargasso Sea and the movie Jefferson in Paris.-relationships of the South.

Well, My False Heart is the first of Liz Carlyle's books I've read and it took me about a month to push through it. I wanted to like this book, but other than being disappointed by the review ratings versus the story, I was left feeling indifferent.  I've read that My False Heart is Liz Carlyle's debut novel &amp; I'll say right now: I hope she gets better. I have four more books of hers to read.<br />My False Heart was just...average, bland, and boring.  I didn't see enough about this story that was remarkable or compelling to warrant the reviews that it has received.  In fact, this story was marked by an absense of momentum, much like Jacquie d'Alessandro's &quot;Red Roses Mean Love&quot; and Linda Francis Lee's &quot;Swan's Grace&quot; that were also highly rated and also, you guessed it, dullsville.  This story just did not come to life for me.<br />I liked that Evie was half-Flemish, but her family doesn't retain any Flemish customs or ever live there during the story.  I bought that Marquis of Rannoch was a formidable character, but his sudden interest in his daughter seemed convenient and, yes, false.  The conflict over Evie's youngest brother &amp; heir being taken away was streeeeetched out over most of the novel and it felt like a manufactured contrivance.  Most of Evie's family didn't have quite enough characterization to be interesting, except for her teenage brother who fought with Elliot.  I was also looking for some real fireworks when Evie found out that she had been deceived by someone she had been intimate with.  Well, she ranted and raged and I yawned.<br />My False Heart reminded me quite a bit of Loretta Chase's Captives of the Night, but that just highlighted this book's inadequacies. Leila Beaumont is a much better drawn &quot;foreign tempermental artist&quot; than the heroine in My False Heart and &quot;secretive heroes with double identities&quot; don't get much better than the Comte d'Esmond.  Read it and see if you don't agree. If you like My False Heart, please try Loretta Chase's Captives of the Night and Lord of Scoundrels and Judith Ivory's Beast and Dance and see if you don't appreciate the differences.<br />I look forward to Liz Carlyle's writing improving with her next books.with double identities&quot; don't get much better than the Comte d'Esmond.

I just have to add my voice to the chorus: this book is unbelievably good.<br />I was short of breath after I raced through the last few chapters. I had to read them over again. A fabulous, wonderful finish!  You feel exalted, elated, worried, and such sorrow for Harry Potter.  I know I started crying! I was thinking that this book is almost too intense for young readers, you get so caught up in the story.  <br />This is a fabulous adventure story &amp; HP &amp; the Goblet of Fire has within it important lessons about winning, losing, &amp; sportsmanship that will impact its readers.<BR> This is the best of the bunch (so far)!

You will not be sorry you bought this book.  One-of-a-kind.<br />This is a story told through photographs, with text providing some framework for the pictures. Dignified, moving, insightful. The photographs date back to the 1800s and focus specifically on photographs of African-Americans.  Only the very last few pages of the album have contemporary photographs of adults and children.<br />There are formal portraits of black families in their finest attire, pictures of black intellectuals, candid pictures of black families, children, social life, families on their homesteads, in large metropolitan cities, working in fields, upper-class black people.<br />More photographs than I have ever seen before of past generations of African-Americans in all of their variety. Photographs are worth a thousand words; more clear and illuminating than a dry volume of essays on the African-American experience.  This history is in living color.<br />I have seen some libraries classify this album as a children's book, but it is not one.  This is a full-size album, with stories told through photographs. This is a book to show to your children, to display and to cherish. A beautiful record of the past.	2001-06-25

She and a Texan are the only two passengers on a stagecoach when they lose their driver and the coach crashes upon the moors.  Away from the constraints of their responsibilities and the prying eyes of society, a sense of uninhibition and freedom dawns on the couple in the isolated, primitive English moors.<br />This book could have been titled &quot;A Texan in England&quot; since the hero, Sam Cody, is a gentleman-rancher transplanted in England and that is figured upon so prevalently within the book. He is full of American-West idioms and analogies.  Judith Ivory keeps the cultural &amp; class differences between Sam &amp; Lydia constantly in the reader's mind, while showing how they are swayed by their attraction to each other and temporary freedom. Ms. Ivory sets this story up with exquisite care. The atmosphere and character's actions and emotions are described with such nuance while they are on the moors it's a pleasure to read.  There are several great exchanges between Sam &amp; Lydia. Many times I just guffawed at their rejoinders and delighted in the differences that kept them at odds.<br />However, I thought it was just pure romance-novel silliness when at a particular moment Lydia, a sheltered virgin, literally grabbed onto Sam.  That scene could have been handled much better and was just a throw-the-book-against-the-wall moment.  But the book, after that transgression, returned to its previous tone. Unfortunately, the momentum fades upon Sam &amp; Lydia's return to civiliation, mostly because they don't share enough scenes together.  But at this point, Ms. Ivory's unflinching look at the classism of English nobility is refreshing, when so many other romances sugercoat or romanticize it.<br />There are many fine points to recommend this novel: the nuanced writing in the first half, the protagonists' chemistry, and the comic dialogue. This romance is worth reading.  The writing, dialogue, and certain elements of the plot are unique and engrossing.  The tenor and momentum of the plot is just not consistent.st half, the protagonists' chemistry, and the comic dialogue. This romance is worth reading.

This is my favorite contemporary romance of all time!  Smart, sexy, funny, human....My HIGHEST 5-star rating.  I can't rave about the quality of writing in this book enough.  Great setting, characters, story-- A small, perfect, pleasing gem.<br /><br /> Eccentric Daisy Flattery collects thrift-store furniture, stray cats, and wishes her life were as interesting as the stories she tells.<br /> When her upstairs, uptight, but incredibly gorgeous neighbor Linc Blaise needs a fiancee to clench a position as a history professor in a small-town college, he, against his better judgment, can't think of anyone who could lie better than Daisy Flattery, professional storyteller (and starving artist).<br /> Linc, a workaholic, with his chrome-and-glass furniture and black Porshe has his life just the way he wants it.  He finds himself maddened but attracted-against-his-will to Daisy, with her stray cats, cracked Tiffany lamps, and compulsion to embellish her life at faculty gatherings.<br /> When Linc and Daisy conveniently break up after Linc is hired for the position at the college, the chair of Linc's department makes it clear that a fiancee/wife was part of the bargain.  Linc is sufficently compelled to make a temporary &quot;Cinderella Deal&quot; with Daisy that will change them both.<br /><br /> This book is so good the above synopsis doesn't do it justice.  Jennifer Crusie's other novels provide the best example of her unique, sharp dialogue.  Daisy Flattery-Blaise is a frizzy-haired, granny-dress-wearing romantic and also a feminist. She won't change who she is to please Linc or anybody else.  The melding of these two characters is riotous, clever, and pleasing.<br /> FYI: Published in 1996 by Loveswept, this romance is now out-of-print, but well-worth finding.  It is the length of a serial romance.	2001-04-25

I was up until 3 a.m. reading this story; I could not tear myself away.  This is one of the best romances I have read in years.  My reader's cap goes off to you, Ms. Abe.<br /> This plot can best be described as a supernatural medieval romance.  The legend of this story lends the plot great momentum since it suggests that the hero and heroine are destined to come together. The legend is so pervasive and integral to this story that it is almost a third character. The story is made even better by the presence of a strong-willed and intelligent heroine whose misgivings and self-doubt are the central conflicts of this story.  Wonderfully poignant romance.  You will love this book.<br /> Other wonderful romances with similar themes are:  Green Darkness by Anya Seton and Fallen Angel by Elizabeth Thornton	2001-03-01

I thought the book was indeed fast-paced and had a balanced plot with all of the facets coming  together in a satisfying way.<br /><br />  However, Harry Potter and the  Sorcerer's Stone didn't blow my mind.  I thought it was good, but not  unbelievably good.  The books I read by Lois Lenski, Cynthia Voigt, and  Judy Blume were as fresh, vigorous, and funny as this Harry Potter book,  and in my opinion, more so.<br /> With the remainder of the series to read, I  hope I do fall in love with the series like many adults and children  have.<br /> Incidentally, I would love to see Ms. Rowling feature a female  protagonist in her next series.	2000-07-15

This first book is an auspicious start to the Malloren series!<br /><br /> Heroine Chastity Ware holds up a coach disguised as a highwayman to raise funds to help her sister escape her husband's family.  Unfortunately for her, this is just the kind of adventure, the man in the coach, Cyn  Malloren, is looking for.  He coerces Chastity into taking him along on her  &amp; her sister's flight from their pursuers and, of course, all sorts of  hilarious obstacles rise to meet them.<br /><br /> A wonderful and clever scene  is when Cyn Malloren masquerades as a woman to outsmart the villains.  Moreover, one of the great sources of humor in this story is that while  Chastity continues to masquerade as a boy, Cyn deduced in their first  dealings together that she is a girl.  They continue for half the book with  him knowing Chastity is a girl, unbeknownst to her, &amp; playing tricks on  her. This book is too clever not to get five stars!<br /><br /> This is the  first Jo Beverley romance I have read; it was more erotic &amp; darker than  I expected.  However, those elements only lend themselves to the strength  and motivation of the storyline. Rothgar Malloren is a particularly  well-conceived character as the intimidating, omnipresent figurehead of the  Malloren family.  He is one to watch in subsequent books on the Malloren  family.<br /><br /> Check out Robin Schone and Susan Johnson for similar erotic  and dark-toned romances.	2000-04-30

On that recommendation, I read it and found it to be an extraordinarily original and distinctive time-travel  romance.<br /><br /> Chloe Plum is a law professor in contemporary New Orldeans  whose personal life is in a mess.  Her fiance betrayed her.  She suffers a  miscarriage soon afterwards and finds out she cannot have children.  She  then begins to suffer from debilitating insomnia during which she distantly  hears a baby crying.<br /> She reluctantly decides to try hypnotherapy for  her insomnia. In doing so, she slips into the life of a past ancestress in  Victorian times.  What is even more surprising is her ancestress's problems  parallel those in Chloe's own life.<br /><br /> Olga Bicos does an amazing job  with the plot: she keeps two different timelines in dialogue with each  other and periodically drops in coincidences to have the two timelines  reflect back on each other.  The reasons for the time-travel are complex  and compelling.<br /><br /> This is a wonderful time-travel that is on my Top  Ten Romances of All-Time list. This time-travels comes right under Diana  Gabaldon's Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber for me.  Wrapped in Wishes  reminds me of Linda Howard's Son of the Morning in a lot of ways, but this  one was first and in many ways better.	2000-04-14

This book is cliched and overripe. Kept waiting for the best romance of all time to unfold. It doesn't.  The \\"surprise\\" ending  is one the reader can figure out by the end of the first chapter.  The  familial relationships are contrived.  The Louisiana Cajun setting is  interesting, but the characters are not original or engaging.

First Lady is one of the merely great ones, but S. E. Phillips' merely great work is usually better than other romance authors' best  novels. First Lady Nealy Case shows as much nerve as she does class, but I  found it difficult to believe that she takes in freedom and the common  man's life with undiluted wonder and delight.  Surely, shedding her  insulated world so completely should have caused her more psychological  trauma. The teenage Lucy is my favorite character and the book is made by  her presence alone. Great moments, great dialogue, but Nealy Case fits into  this easy-bake family too easily.  Satisfying, delivering, but not  Phillips' best.... Read It Could Happen to You and Lady Be Good for Susan  Elizabeth Phillips' fabulous, unbelievably good work.

Adrian Hunt is one of the most memorable heroes I have encountered in a romance.  Judith Ivory/Judy Cuevas, like Diana Gabaldon,  doesn't play by the rules or bow to the dictates of the traditional  romantic story outline. The story in this romance goes far beyond where  other romances end. Set during the French Revolution in England and France,  Adrian Hunt is the half-English and half-French agent who plays both ends  against the middle.  Christina Bower, the daughter of a barrister, is in  the process of a divorce when she finds herself in the path of Adrian Hunt,  Earl of Kewischester.  Ignore the hokey Zebra cover and title.  Judith  Ivory/Judy Cuevas delivers with this book.  One of my favorite romances of  all-time.<br /> This story is reminiscent of Jane Feather's French  Revolution-set Love's Charade and, of course, Judy Cuevas/Judith Ivory's  other titles, Bliss & Dance, also set in France.	2000-01-16

I first read this book in a Sociology class when I was a senior in college.  I was particularly interested because my parents had divorced a couple of years earlier.  The ten year look at the effect of divorce on all persons involved is very insightful and rigorously researched.  Second  Chances presented several scenarios of what can occur after divorce.  I  found one of those scenarios for how children cope after divorce to be true  for me. This book will open your eyes about the effects of divorce on both  parents and children.
