On the basis of that first  page, I had prepared myself for the kind of involvement and hilarity that I  have come to expect from David Sedaris, and I was not disappointed.   Burroughs is a master storyteller - he gets the details right, creates  characters that leap from the page, and makes you howl with laughter.  This  is a great romp through the world of home shopping networks, if we could  but peek behind the scenes and infuse it with the wicked imagination it  surely begs for.  I hated tosee Sellevision end, because ther is nothing  more therapeutic than a great laugh -- I eagarly await Mr. Burrough's next  novel.  In fact I am going to sit right here and wait.

My son had his umbilical cord wrapped twice around his neck and a prolapsed placenta ; it was an emergency C section and I will never forget it.  This book touched  me deeply in so many ways, and I feel it was an act of courage to finally  express the unthinkable loss of a child.  The woman next to me in ICU  recovery had also lost her child, and I felt much the same as the  author...wanting to comfort her but not knowing quite how to.  I especially  liked the way the author captured the sense of being shocked at the loss of  control that accompanies birth (and motherhood).  I recommend this book to  any woman who has considered moving past loss into a second or third chance  at the greatest experience : motherhood:  with all of its terrors and  confusions and poignant heart splitting moments of unbearable love and  vunerability.....cheers to this author for transformming what could have  been a destructive and bitter experience into hope and a kind of  triumph......	2000-07-02

Additionally, her wonderfully gritty voice doles out practical writing advice with sturdy handles, the kind you literally cannot get from any oridinary seminar.   Much of this tape is subsumed within her bestselling book, Bird By Bird,  yet there is plenty that is unique to Word By Word to make it well worth  the price; not the least of which is hearing the poem which Anne's dog  Sadie wrote to her, wherein Sadie ponders the question:  'Should she (the  author) really be driving?' Hilarious and poignant as ever, Lamott mixes up  wry asides with text from her writing manual, and makes everything  difficult seem worth undertaking.  All in all, a generous illumination and  expansion of several classic Lamott topics; hearing her say it in her own  words brings it crackling to life.

What courage it took this man to not just survive, but to become a beloved teacher, given the harsh   circumstances of his birth.  He is proof of the tenacity of the spirit; yet  a sense of victimhood is distinctly missing from his work, throughout his  travails he perseveres and keeps his exhuberant sense of humor.  While  deeply moved, I laughed out loud repeatedly, and was impressed with his  mastery of language and character.  It's hard to believe he remembers word  for word conversations from so long ago, especially after so many  &quot;pints&quot;:  he therefore has reconstructed the most wonderful and  fresh dialogue I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  This is not a  memoir, it is communion.  McCourt is a national treasure and his humility  is rare and exquisite.

I want to be always by my bedside, in case of emergency -- like a revolver.  Her way with dialogue and character is simply a joy - I fully  agree with the comparisons to Austen.  Lipman has adroitly nailed the  archetype of the diehard, attention-and-heat-seeking-missile-bachelor to  perfection. As a novel it is nimble, sustaining, and frankly delicious.  In  the place I am at in the book, the veal cassarole has just come down on  Harvey's head, and he is playing it for all it is worth --can he get some  sex out of this?- you can hear him calculating, as gravy slides down his  forehead.  Great scene.  I can't wait to see what happens, and yet I am  also loathe to see it end.  Divine, and certainly worth every penny.	1999-12-30

The first page is the most mesmerizing I've ever encountered, it snakes a hand gently around your throat and squeezes. When you come to, you have not only  finished this book and its marvelous sequels, each more darkly rich than  the last, you have devoured Couples, The Coup, The Centaur, Marry Me, The  Witches of Eastwick, S., A Month of Sundays, In The Beauty of the Lillies,  and everything else this man has laid his hand to.  You don't read Updike,  you join a cult.<br />I can remember the first time I read Rabbit, and how it  seemed an important journey was beginning.  God couldn't write a better  first page.  Perhaps Updike is God.  <br />Harry Angstrom is delicious; so  deeply flawed, a black diamond.  He was sexist but not unusually so - he  perfectly reflects our culture.  And yet I don't consider Updike a man's  writer, any more than I think of Eudora Welty as a woman's writer.  They're  far too muscular to be limited by gender.  Oh, read it.

How does he do it?  How?  And how may we ensure he never stops.   Perhaps he needs to be locked in a hotel room and made to write books while  room service is administered.<br />ALL the caustic wit of HIGH FIDELITY, and  he's added a few new flourishes, in the way that Porsche does every so  often. <br />Hornby, he's just dead great and makes it look easy.	1999-10-12

Yet he is not limited to his extraordinarily deft touch with language.  His concepts in FOR COMMON THINGS reach beyond the kind of psychobabble that usually passes for wisdom  in this Spandex society -- agree with him or not, he is a thinker, someone  Mark Twain would have gotten drunk with.  I myself would like to raise a  glass to this intelligent and incredibly gutsy young author.  I found his  book thought provoking, astonishing, and challenging -- never boring or  superficial.   He has one trait which distinguishes, and doubtless made his  ascent possible : authenticity.  Many will break their necks in their hasty  attempt to degrade and minimize his work; for those like him, that is the  price of being admitted to the pantheon of respected authors.

I for one wish there were a copy of  TRAVELING MERCIES in each hotel room, right next to the Gideon Bible.   Except people would steal them...perhaps there should be a chain attached,  like on phone books.  <br />TM is warm, hilarious, self deprecating and life  affirming...it reminds us with finely crafted prose why we are here in the  global asylum.  There are one or two &quot;reviewers&quot; who have been  lobbing vicious hand grenades at Ms. Lamott's sites -- Pay no attention --  this book is clearly a winner - just wonderful.

Also a wonderful and compelling book	I am amused at the nasty one star reviewers who feel that Waiting To Exhale is ONLY about black people, a kind of press conference for inter racial subject matter.  Have you ever read Moby Dick?  If so, I am here to  tell you that is not about whales, not really-- and it is not about White  whales either.  I don't have time to teach the alphabet to nasty folks but  I will try:  Waiting To Exhale is a NOVEL.  NOVELS are not to be taken  literally, they are creative expressions. I can just see the surprised look  on some simple faces -- go back to your Nickelodean, don't even bother with  literature, stick to HIGHLIGHT magazine, and maybe -- maybe -- Goodnight  Moon.  Anyway I loved it; laughed out loud even the second time through.   LOVE her way with dialogue and character.  McMillan is a fresh and powerful  voice who has, because of her extreme success and popularity, become a  sometime target for the bitter and the jealous, not to mention the feeble.   Spike Lee wrote a lengthy book jacket quote for the book, in support of Ms.  McMillan, addressing the Black male issue as it pertains to the book, and  perhaps this should be enlightening to those who care to look further.   Spike Lee is not in the habit of suffering fools or racism -- so get a  clue.  His support and the support of thousands of loyal fans (black,  white, red, yellow and purple) should prove that McMillan is a talent --  yes indeed, there are some who know how to read, not REED.	1999-09-29

I adored this book, especially the pieces entitled TRAVELLING  MERCIES and TRIBE -- but then I'm splitting hairs :)  or dreads -- because  the entire book is finely crafted and superb.   the bitter will spew venom  in your general direction as a way to alleviate their own suffering, no  doubt -- success, especially a woman's success, is hard for some to  swallow.  I suggest a rest cure and/or Ginko for those who would throw  stones at a talented author who has never been grandiose or posing -- just  real.

Though I wanted to look deeper, there was no surface to scratch....because underneath the  brash, glitzy exterior of this novel is another surface:  It is like a  plastic onion in revealing lingerie.  Those of you mining for nuggets of  hard-won wisdom will probably go without.  Some laughs, to be fair, several  good ones.... but mostly sighs of boredom.  Perhaps this is just the book  the author had to get out the way before she could write something more  worthy of her talents.	1999-08-20

The characters were adroitly drawn, the humor fresh.  What's even more amusing, however, are the mean-spirited customer reviews -- especially the recent reader who said that anyone who likes this book enjoys soap operas and is  illiterate.  The arrogance of such a remark is stunning; I can only imagine  the kind of bitter, pretentious and hugely insecure person who would be  driven to this kind of blanket judgement.  A graduate of Yale, I thoroughly  enjoyed this book -- I am certain I am not the only smart woman who liked  it.  Clearly there are some people who need a good long rest, and to stop  looking at Amazon as a way to spew venom.  Of course, it IS a compliment to  the author that anyone could be psychotically fixated on &quot;bringing the  curve down.&quot; -- she must have struck a nerve.  Simply hilarious.	1999-08-18

The stories were compelling and often shocking -- I especially liked Archie -- her making him a sympathetic character is proof of her gifts.  The naysayers in this  quaint n' cruel forum seem hysterical in their breakneck attempts to  downgrade a major success. One may not cotton to Jane, but GGHF is indeed  well written (how could anyone debate this?).  I found it humorous,  original, and striking; not like Bridget Jones in the least.  I laughed at  loud at many places, not the least of which was the Mister Mother%$#$^ line  and the Aunt Rita line (&quot;Men think with their &amp;*%^$s&quot;).   Those who frothily disagree with Ms. Bank's triumph can make it right when  they have their own books on the NYTimes bestseller list.  I am sure that  will be happening at any moment.	1999-08-12

The hotel had a copy of HIGH  FIDELITY in its small &quot;lenders&quot; library and I snatched it with  huge relief. It was even better the second time.  While bolts of pain shot  down my left leg and my unborn son trounced merrily on my spine, I followed  Hornby's tale of love, lust and ambiguity to its brilliant conclusion.   Laughing out loud is difficult when you are third-trimester incontinent,  but I managed.  This is one of my  favorite books -- wickedly funny, dead  brutal, and absolutely uproarious in its twists.  It is one of those rare  books that can be equally enjoyed by both sexes --  Hornby is a riot, a  writer's writer.  I especially liked his use of music -- an added thread of  interest to an already engrossing narrative.  His characters are oddly  real, compelling, a joy -- the dialogue crackles with life.  I gasped more  than once at his exhuberant style, his sure hand with the most delicate of  subjects.  If you read only one book this summer, make it HIGH FIDELITY.  I  would be dumbstruck if ABOUT A BOY were as startling, but I plan to give it  a try.  This man has it.	1999-07-28

Of course if Fielding had been a man, she would have been universally appluaded for her exhuberent wit and candor and  entertainment skills.  As a woman she is ripe for marginilization and  outright crucifixtion.  How sad that we as a culture havent evolved to a  sense of humor about ourselves as women -- that every heroine must be  living alone and loving it, performing neurosurgery for charity, or ladling  soup to ophans unless she is to be praised.  The fact that this book  rocketed to the bestseller list and stayed there speaks for itself. I found  it fun, hilarious, fresh, charming and a great read -- bridget is self  deprecating, doesnt claim to be mother theresa or ghandi.  why must we wish  that on her?  nick hornby wrote with wit and irreverence about his sex life  and everyone just about broke a leg trying to deify him (I love him too)  but helen fielding is being skewered with red hot needles, and I'm not sure  why.  she wrote a comic novel, not a sequel to The Feminine Mystique.  So  what?  And it may be true that this book doesnt hit everyone's mirth spot  -- then why not just ignore it?  why go out of one's way to throw poison  darts?  I think I know why.  It's called Jealousy, and it's been aorund  since the beginning of time.  Ms Fielding deserves not derision, but  applause --  for a sharply honed novel and for starting a Bad girl trend  that moves away from the banal let's  not-offend-anyone-or-tell-too-many-truths claptrap that female writers seem  doomed to.  Helen?  I say write another book, make it even more shocking  and irreverent, and send your critics a superbly wrapped lemon they can  suck on.  I thought her plot was skillfill and would make a terrific film,  especilly the finale.  Loved it, and that doesn;t make me a mindless idiot.   It makes me human.	1999-05-15

She possesses the ability to make people laugh out loud, to incite a placid and  mildly depressed reader to spew beef vindaloo over the pages of a book  while discovering a hilarious passage from the pool of truth.  This is an  author who makes some of us queasy when one considers her first book, Hard  Laughter, which was great and got great reviews and which was published at  23, an age when most of us are trying to find a waitressing job in a fancy  restaurant.  From then on she continued cutting her swath of Hell, with  wonderful novels like Joe Jones and Rosie and All New People, which I've  read three times.  Ironically enough, this is a woman who has professed to  knowing no cosmic reason why she should contiunue writing.  If I, like all  people created, am a part of God, and I've heard that I am, then I hereby  decree that Lamott must continue to write books.  Although she need not do  it at breakneck speed, she must definitely do it (I would also like to  abolish January and Howard Stern). So there's your cosmic reason, Ms.  Lamott.  Additionally, any of you out there who consider yourselves Lamott  fans but have not read All New People and Joe Jones are not being  completely honest...so read them after you read Traveling Mercies (its  Tribute to Jennie Holzer book jacket must also be admired --  at least it's  not a white dove in a shaft of sunlight or some other religious type book  jacket, fleecy cloudy blue sky with a hand coming out of it or whatever.)   Anyway read it.  Read it all, preferably with Indian food.	1999-01-29
