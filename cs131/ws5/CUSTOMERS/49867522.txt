The last Vietnamese that Americans really worried about was Ngo Dinh Diem, a leader who had such a mind of his own that Lind can easily compare him with a situation that was begging for the 9/11 attacks.  \\"If South Vietnam's dictators were no worse than South Korea's, they were not as bad as some of the despots in the Middle East whom the United States has aided in the service of its global grand strategy.  Many of the Muslim mujahideen . . . are now taking part in a murderous jihad or holy war against America and the West.\\"  (p. 234).  These people are turning out to be the people that America should have been protecting the world against, \\"But that is the wrong standard of comparison.  Compared to America's other allies in East Asia, the Saigon elite does not appear to have been uniquely bad.  And in retrospect they appear relatively enlightened, compared to most of America's allies in the Middle East.\\"  (p. 233).<br />Since September 11, 2001, it seems like America has only one ally in the Middle East, and the rest of the area is festering at the prospect that America will treat their governments as underlings in the kind of virtue and morality that are most important to America until their governments can be undermined and replaced by some form of control which is more to our liking, though Iraq seems to be failing in the manner that Vietnam failed to be an ideal place to which to send American troops.  People who still remember enough Vietnamese poetry to dream their poems might be inspired by the few poems in this book, and a report on the aftermath of the war.  \\"Doan Van Toai, a South Vietnamese dissident who was imprisoned after the communist conquest of the South in 1975, recalled an incident in jail:  `As we chime in with `At night I dream I see Uncle Ho,' I realize that several voices in the choir are changing `I see' to `I kill.'  No doubt the new version corresponds more closely to the reality of their dreams.\\"  (p. 244).  This reminds me of current internet polls asking whether it would be more important to capture Osama bin Laden, the radical rich guy who was really waging war on America, or Saddam Hussein, the former government official in Iraq whose people might not be sure whose underlings they are until he is disposed of.  When we have to pick from choices like this, I doubt that we have any real allies in the Middle East, and even the underlings don't seem to like the waiting involved while we resolve which parts they are going to be asked to play.<br />The Preface tried to make a parallel that depended entirely on air superiority.  \\"Reluctantly the president ordered the bombing of the communist-nationalist dictator's homeland, hoping that air power alone would compel the dictator to abandon his campaign of aggression. . . . To escalate the war by introducing ground troops would be to risk a bloody debacle and a political backlash.  Every choice presented the possibility of disaster.\\"  (p. x).  Slobodan Milosevic ended up as a defendant in war crimes proceedings for activities which took place as a result of his dream of a Greater Serbia, but it is still not clear if Osama or Saddam would be equally guilty of the charges brought against him.  \\"Milosevic armed, supplied, and directed Serb paramilitary units engaged in mass murder and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, Kosovo, and other parts of the former Yugoslavia;  Ho armed, supplied, and directed Viet Cong guerillas in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia who waged war . . .\\" (p. xi) and the American armysupported my presence in 2 of those 5 areas, but I didn't want to stay in the army long enough to get shipped to Iraq.<br />VIETNAM/ THE NECESSARY WAR is all about how to have proxy wars, in which the great powers crush the underlings without ever getting into each other's way, except indirectly.  As long as the jihad was being waged by the opponents of Soviet expansion, in was in America's interest to support it, and this book maintains the kind of geopolitical slice and dice approach to who is fighting who that is the only way of viewing things that is going to make sense.  Trying to picture the world as America's underlings, or the Middle East as Israel's underlings, or Libya and the Middle East as oil's overlords, and seizing the assets of anyone who tries to challenge the economic picture by wiping out tourists, museums, rice paddies, villages, foliage, marshes, exploding oil pipelines, newspapers, TV stations, and most people who start shooting rifles in the air in Iraq whenever they are mad about something, threatens to become an awful picture.  This book has a good index, which even has an entry for Operation Flaming Dart, against Dong Hoi, North Vietnam, early in 1965.  You might want to think about that one, for a minute, before you look that up.	2003-06-26
US	49867522	R141DIOFVB7TH8	0061316865	900157080	On Certainty (English and German Edition)	Books	5	6	62	N	N	So damn right, it ought to bleed	If you want to read a book by Wittgenstein, just so you can say you have read him, or because you feel the need for some direct intellectual contact with a leading philosopher of the twentieth century, ON CERTAINTY is certain to be the one which you will understand the best, because it even tells you how you eventually understand something by finally stopping yourself from asking any more questions about it.  As Wittgenstein's last book, close to being his dying words, it is something like a final opportunity for readers to surrender to Wittgenstein's power as a philosopher to keep thinking `I doubt it.'<br />After World War One, Wittgenstein attempted teaching at an elementary level in a few small Austrian farm villages.  Wittgenstein came from a large family which employed an enormous number of tutors to provide its children with individual instruction.  You could read Ray Monk's biography if you are interested in disputes about how many grand pianos were in Wittgenstein's house when he was growing up, and how many he said he had without implying that he could play them all at the same time, later on among Englishmen, who were capable of being impressed by numbers between one and ten, all of which might have been true at one point, if the Wittgensteins brought in a few extra grand pianos for some special occasion.  ON CERTAINTY seems to be driven by the kind of attempt to produce intellectual slaves that was most recently attacked by the decision of the United States Supreme Court striking down the affirmative action program, which granted 20 points out of 150 possible points scored for undergraduate admission to the University of Michigan.<br />Even in free countries, law is expected to dominate in the intellectual slavery of free peoples, and judges, the majority of whom are white people dominated by the kind of logic that appeals to their interests, ultimately control the kind of decisions which can be made when the equality of the systems of the United Statesis directly challenged.  Michigan is a state which is highly developed industrially and intellectually, with a large portion of black descendants of the kind of slaves who made the white masters of the south so financially successful in the years before the American Civil War.  The affirmative action program at the University of Michigan was an attempt to make a large number of the black leaders in Michigan intellectual slaves of a tradition that is so inclusive that the normal political understanding of the politically astute slaves of mediocrity will not allow this kind of uppity boosting to take place.  20 points is outrageous, as a number to be used against the average white applicant, because it suggests a level of intellectual and social attainment that an average politically mediocre individual could never hope to attain.<br />ON CERTAINTY should be a perfect guide for understanding how the 20 point system works, because each individual's score was determined with the kind of mathematical precision that anyone with a brain like Wittgenstein's could only applaud, and any U.S. Supreme Court opinion to the contrary, hoping for some kind of individual evaluation which refuses to stick numbers on particular kinds of distinctions, while trying to achieve the same results, only more indistinctly, raises the possibility that for those who rule, everything is seemingly hidden from the ruled, in the kind of intellectual slavery that could be most aptly described as a secret circus stunt method of swaying vast multitudes, and which damns the state which would try to teach people to think any differently.	2003-06-25
US	49867522	R3BO19U7QK45NU	0664241581	777443176	Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation (The Library of Christian Classics)	Books	5	4	15	N	N	Great minds with a big problem:  God	This book, LUTHER AND ERASMUS:  FREE WILL AND SALVATION, contains some great summaries of the arguments involved.  Originally, Erasmus, author of IN PRAISE OF FOLLY (1509) and a great scholar who edited a Greek New Testament in 1516, pictures his philosophical self as the perfect opponent of tyrannical godliness in DIATRIBE ON FREE WILL (1524).  Luther was offended, not so much that he was named by Erasmus as a particular kind of fool for God, but that Luther's interpretation of the Bible on this question, ON THE BONDAGE OF THE WILL (1525), based on absolute interpretations which depend on the kind of faith proclaimed by Paul, because \\"the power or endeavor of free choice is something different from faith in Jesus Christ.  But Paul denies that anything outside this faith is righteous in the sight of God; and if it is not righteous in the sight of God, it must necessarily be sin. . . .  With men, of course, it is certainly a fact that there are middle and neutral cases, where men neither owe one another anything nor do anything for one another.  But an ungodly man sins against God whether he eats or drinks or whatever he does, because he perpetually misuses God's creatures in his impiety and ingratitude, and never for a moment gives glory to God from his heart.\\"  (p. 308).<br />In the history of religion, Martin Luther might be remembered mainly for his opposition to the established church of his time and place.  Having been subject to many vows as a monk, he openly rejected certain restrictions that the religious organizations of his day had imposed on those who wished to lead worship or serve communion, and his marriage was a scandal that was altogether typical of the kind of disagreements in that time which survive in some form in the present day.  One question of faith that I still find meaningful, in FREE WILL AND SALVATION, is the Bible's comparison of life with military service, as assumed in the first verse of chapter 7 of the book of Job, which Luther uses to explain a similar passage in Isaiah.  \\" `The life of man is a warfare upon earth,' that is there is a set time for it.  I prefer to take it simply, in the ordinary grammatical sense of `warfare,' so that Isaiah is understood to be speaking of the toilsome course of the people under the law, as if they were engaged in military service.\\"  (p. 267).<br />As old Europe attempts to secularize itself into an economic empire with minuscule military forces, it seems oddly historical that a few fundamentally religious political movements are being tied to such warfare as exists in our times, a modern age in which terrorism excites the forces of civilization so much that no government or political spokesman that harbors such killers is safe.  LUTHER AND ERASMUS:  FREE WILL AND SALVATION does not attempt to solve this problem.  If anything, this book is just a book that shows how knowledge in the form of books can trap scholars by allowing them to do what the best scholars have always been best at, exhibiting the meaning of states of mind that others usually flee, far beyond the realm of what Job 7:1 in THE JERUSALEM BIBLE asks, \\"Is not man's life on earth nothing more than pressed service, his time no better than hired drudgery?\\"<br />Happenstance, at the end of World War II, picked on Hiroshima, for the purpose of a ten-minute speech, to be a military base, instead of a city, for the announcement of the use of an atomic bomb on August 6, 1945.  Most people's lives, the way they live, are more like the city, now, but there is a geopolitical interpretation of world power that allows anyplace to be the Hiroshima of the moment, if the rest of the world wants to see it that way.  Luther blames the devil, in FREE WILL AND SALVATION, whenever a man thinks he is choosing to do something on his own, and considering Hiroshima a military base instead of a city in 1945 is the kind of thinking that ought to be considered worthy of the devil, even if Harry Truman was willing to adopt itfor ten minutes so he would not seem too far out of step with his military advisers.  But the outcry, after dropping a couple atomic bombs within a week back then, started to make it obvious that not everybody was inclined to accept the incineration of cities so lightly.  I might even be leaving out something terrible about the nature of the judgment of God, which is the primary topic of this book, because Luther seems so much closer to the nature of Hiroshima than we are, survivors though some of us might be.  What makes LUTHER AND ERASMUS:  FREE WILL AND SALVATION such heavy reading now is because it makes no attempt to lighten up to match the spiritually and economically commercial nature of our society, which usually considers itself thoroughly artistic or comical, especially in the manner in which people all get along by going along.  Half of this book doubts that the world could ever be considered so normal.  After a general index (which includes some latin phrases, though the tough latin phrases, like *praeter casam,* are explained in an \\"Appendix:  On the Adagia of Erasmus\\") of several pages, the Biblical References take most of four pages.  Anyone who wondered why Luther thought Christians should be reading the Bible, instead of being spoon fed lessons by officials, should get a load of this.  Praeter casam to you, too.	2003-06-22

This book has more information than a lot of people, presuming the innocence of just about everything, would want to cope with.  Among the people listed as interviewees in the front of this book are Efraim ---, six other former members of Mossad, William Casey, and William Colby.  The death of William Casey was famously reported in VEIL by Bob Woodward, published in 1987, after Casey had a craniotomy and had been taken to Mayknoll to die.  \\"He contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized on Long Island.  There, the morning of May 6, the day after Congress began its public hearings on the Iran-contra affair, Casey died.\\"  Woodward interpreted Casey's death as a kind of silence which fell in line with the question:  What hurts, sir?  \\"What you don't know,\\" he said.  (Veil, pp. 506-507).  This book, ROBERT MAXWELL, ISRAEL'S SUPERSPY/ THE LIFE AND MURDER OF A MEDIA MOGUL, (2002), was written in the spirit of William Casey's final interview.  If the factual basis for some of its assertions seem a bit ghostly, you might blame all the Bills, or other outrageous bills, or the authors, Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon, or anyone who seems to know more than any trap-door possessing Prosecutor's Management Information Systems software salesman with investments in newspapers, scientific journals, and an account in the Bank of Bulgaria could keep track of, at the age of sixty-eight, or after November, 1991, when Robert Maxwell, also, was dead.<br />A society which employs Certified Public Accountants presupposes that people will be able to keep track of certain things, certainly money, for sure, and who people are, though this book finds a certain glory in how easy it is to fool official guardians of the identity assumptions with simple tricks.  Obviously, this works best at places like Numec, a company specializing in reprocessing nuclear waste, in Apollo, Pennsylvania.  Anybody ought to be able to figure out how likely it is that the following events, prior to December 1982, but reported as background information, might have actually occurred:<br />His two companions were described on their cards as scientists from `The Department of Electronics, University of Tel Aviv, Israel'.<BR>There was no such department.<BR>The men were LAKAM security officers whose task would be to see the best way of stealing fissionable waste from Numec.  All three spent four days in Apollo, passing many hours touring the Numec plant, sitting for more hours in Shapiro's office.  What they spoke about would remain a secret.  On the fifth day Eitan and his companions left Apollo as unobstrusively as they had arrived.<BR>A month later the first of nine shipments of containers of nuclear waste left Numec.  Each container would bear the words:  `Property of the State of Israel:  Ministry of Agriculture'.  The containers would carry a stencil stating they had full diplomatic clearance and so were exempt from customs checks before they were stowed on board El Al cargo freighters to Tel Aviv.<BR>The containers were destined for Dimona, Israel's nuclear facility in the Negev Desert.  (pp. 55-56)<br />One way to be a Mogul, buying companies close to bankruptcy and investing enough to turn them into successes, is described in this book as just the starting point for how \\"Robert Maxwell was the Barnum and Bailey of the financial world, the great stock market ringmaster able to introduce with consummate speed and a crack of his whip some new and even more startling financial act.  But increasingly his high-wire actions had become more dangerous - and long ago he had abandoned any idea of a safety net.\\"  (p. 34).  Maxwell's arrangements with Vladimir Kryuchkov, head of the Soviet KGB, who had been involved in the August plot to oust Mikhail Gorbachev from office, made certain bankers insecure enough to want Maxwell to pay some of their loans.  Maxwell thought 400 million pounds might be enough \\"to stave off his morepressing creditors.  He asked Mossad to use its influence with Israel's banker's to arrange a loan.  He was told to try to do what his fellow tycoon, Rupert Murdoch, had done when he had faced a similar situation.  Murdoch had confessed his plight to his bankers and then renegotiated his debts, which were almost twice what Maxwell owed.\\"  (pp. 13-14).  Actually, Maxwell must have owed far more than he told the Mossad.  A Daily Mirror headline in the photographs section, after the \\"Maxwell Dies at Sea\\" picture, reported, \\"Maxwell: 536m pounds is missing from his firms/ The increasingly desperate actions of a desperate man.\\"<br />Assuming that much, the rest of the book is written around questions raised by Efraim.<br />`If the truth about Robert Maxwell surfaces and he is destroyed in the process, who else will be compromised?  How great will the damage be to Israel?'  (p. 15).<br />Americans might be interested in this book for judging the current chances for success of American policies that seem to parallel the desperation of Robert Maxwell, but might cause Bill Casey even greater pain, if he were still in charge.	2003-06-14
US	49867522	R19HSAYOQYQH64	0253340616	392129259	Nietzsche, "The Last Antipolitical German"	Books	4	5	6	N	N	The Kaisers, Bismarck, and the Nietzsches	Quite a biography, NIETZSCHE, \\"THE LAST ANTIPOLITICAL GERMAN\\" by Peter Bergmann, published in 1987, is a historian's attempt to place Nietzsche's writings in the political setting that provides a context for whatever goal Nietzsche might have been driving at in each stage of his development.  In the history of philosophy before Nietzsche, Hegel is usually considered an official university philosopher who wished to preserve the significance of theology without clinging to the godlike articles of faith that define God in the hearts of believers.  Bergmann asserts that Nietzsche never studied any of Hegel's books, but formed opinions based upon a political context in which the philosophy of Hegel represented an intellectual point of view that only needed to be aped by official philosophers.<br />I picked this book off my shelf again, after all these years, to look for the modern parallels which, like \\"The new anarchism of the eighties, heralded by Prince Kropotkin, a scholarly, pacific type, became inarticulate in its love affair with dynamite.\\"  (p. 147).  Writing about a situation which preceded our times by a hundred years, Bergmann examined Nietzsche's reactions to steps that the United States has recently used against Osama bin Laden.<br />\\"Bismarck put increasing pressure on Switzerland.  In August 1881 Swiss authorities expelled Kropotkin after his return from a much-publicized international anarchist congress in London.  Six months before, the newly elected President of the Swiss Confederacy had committed suicide, stung, it was said, by charges of his former radical friends that he was bargaining away the historic rights of Swiss asylum.\\"  (p. 147).<br />Chapter One, \\"The Anti-Motif\\" is short.  Much interpretation of Nietzsche has already established that \\"Nietzsche's works have appropriately been read as a lifelong effort to fashion an `anti-self,' one that would free him from the claims of the initial self.  Existentialists, concentrating on the struggles ofthe self, embraced what they perceived as Nietzsche's flight from the political.\\"  (p. 5).  In Chapter Two, \\"The Clerical Son,\\" maintains that \\"Nietzsche kept the dilemma of the clerical son before him throughout his life.\\"  (p. 29).<br />In our more modern age, dominated by the information provided through a secularized mass media, it might be difficult to picture the authority that Pastor Karl Ludwig Nietzsche (1813-1849) exercised in the Evangelical church within the provincial world of a small town.  Modern presidents who picture their position as a minor miracle granted by God might appreciate such \\"Pietist theologians and country parsons\\" who \\"became the vigilant censors of thought and behavior.  Ludwig enthusiastically greeted Friedrich Wilhelm IV's accession and his proclamation of the Christian state. . . . Among Prussia's six thousand Protestant clergymen, Ludwig would be one of the king's most ardent supporters, always believing in the bond between religion and politics.\\"  (p. 10).  Nietzsche's mother was only seventeen when she married Ludwig, hardly educated, but \\"They fully shared each other's pietistic enthusiasm.  Franziska's strict, simple piety would remain undisturbed throughout her life, with her letters of the 1890s still breathing the emotive and by then anachronistic Pietist language of mid-century.\\"  (p. 10).<br />Those in the 1840s who were expecting that \\"religion is once again and will in the immediate future be even more the axis around which the world will revolve\\" (p. 11) were surprised that \\"The revolution of 1848 would bring this era of religious politics to an abrupt end.  Nietzsche's earliest recorded memories were of peasants near his village celebrating the outbreak of the revolution with red flags.\\"  (p. 11).  \\"The protestant churches, it seemed, had lost their institutional hold over the populace, and in its stead the army had to secure monarchic authority.\\"  (p. 12).<br />Chapter Three, \\"The Generation of 1866,\\" tracks \\"a moodof calamity\\" (p. 31) in which \\"the entire issue of Friedrich Wilhelm IV's madness and death was problematic,\\" and the celebration of the coronation of Wilhelm I was described by Nietzsche as \\"terribly boring, the fireworks on the hill and the bonfire only a little less so, and then the whole evening.  It was ghastly.\\"  (p. 31).  Some people in Iraq seem to be overreacting to their liberation in 2003 from Saddam Hussein with a similar lack of enthusiasm for the American troops who can pull down statues, but then what?  Those German young people who expected more opportunities to prosper in the growing federation of German states after the war between Prussia and Austria in 1866, also experienced the Danish war which \\"concluded in a squalid struggle between Prussia and Austria over the spoils.\\"  (p. 37).  In 1866, \\"Nietzsche found himself in the anomalous situation of being a Prussian in occupied Leipzig.\\"  (p. 47).  After some involvement in politics, \\"Nietzsche left Leipzig to escape the cholera epidemic invading the city.\\"  (p. 48).<br />Chapter Four, \\"The Spectacle of Greatness,\\" following some previous mention of Schopenhauer, examines the tension between the illegitimacy of the Bismarckian state and the Wagnerian movement toward the Bayreuth festival of 1876.  As a young professor, Nietzsche was attempting to bring antiquity to life, and Johann Jacob Bachofen gets credit for \\"arcane studies of the mythological prehistory of the ancient world that included the novel thesis of an earlier matriarchal age.\\"  (p. 90).  This should no longer be a surprise.  According to Will Durant, THE LIFE OF GREECE, (1939) before Cecrops, who founded Athens, children did not know their own father.  \\"The descendants of Cecrops ruled Athens as kings.  The fourth in line was Erechtheus, . . . His grandson, Theseus, about 1250, merged the twelve demes or villages of Attica into one political unity, whose citizens, wherever they lived, were to be called Athenians.\\"  Our civilization isonly 3400 years younger than that matriarchy, and with all the crazy things that men do, it is not too surprising that Nietzsche started life in a home ruled by his grandmother, who moved the family and let him stay in a back room after his father died.	2003-06-13
US	49867522	R2QU0OX6D0NQSR	0140159959	628844704	Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius	Books	4	1	6	N	N	Mildly lifelike	Wittgenstein is the kind of philosopher who keeps thinking up new approaches, publishing little during his life, but widely admired by those who could consider him a teacher.  Having been raised in a cultured family in Vienna, he had been formally trained in the arts, such as music, so well that &quot;When he played, he was not expressing himself, his own primordial life, but the thoughts, the life, of others.&quot;  (p. 240).  Ray Monk has tracked down a lot of information to produce this book.  People who have more interest in philosophy itself might learn more about what was considered important during his life by reading the portions of THE SOCIOLOGY OF PHILOSOPHIES, A GLOBAL THEORY OF INTELLECTUAL CHANGE by Randall Collins.  Philosophers don't naturally find &quot;The Duty of Genius,&quot; the subtitle of Ray Monk's biography, LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN, as much as they compete for attention in the creative spheres of their own time.<br />Due to the unique shift in the lives of many Viennese university professors to England and America at a troubled time in the twentieth century, many readers around the world are in a position to appreciate Wittgenstein's ideas.  In Chapter 13 of THE SOCIOLOGY OF PHILOSOPHIES, subtitled, &quot;Boundaries as Philosophical Puzzles,&quot; sections have the titles, &quot;The Social Invention of Higher Mathematics&quot; (pp. 697-709), &quot;The Logicism of Russell and Wittgenstein&quot; (pp. 709-717), &quot;The Vienna Circle as a Nexus of Struggles&quot; (pp. 717-730), &quot;The Ordinary Language Reaction against Logical Formalism&quot; (pp. 731-734), and &quot;Wittgenstein's Tortured Path&quot; (pp. 734-737).  Wittgenstein was able to matter to many of the thinkers who found a place in that chapter, and Randall Collins explains the places in the philosophical world.<br />Ray Monk's biography, LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN, might seem much more disappointing because the author never seems to have figured out any ultimate questions.  Familiar names appear in this book, but the immediacy of life is often lacking.  A meeting between Wittgenstein and Moritz Schlick, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Vienna, is described as not actually occurring until &quot;Gretl succeeded where Schlick himself had, on more than one occasion over a number of years, failed.&quot;  (p. 241).  People with lives that are constantly changing might appreciate how Schlick read TRACTATUS in 1922, wrote to Wittgenstein at Puchberg in 1924, received a reply from Wittgenstein from Otterthal, made a trip to Otterthal in April, 1926 with a few students, but &quot;On arriving in Otterthal the pilgrims were deeply disappointed to be told that Wittgenstein had resigned his post and had left teaching.&quot;  (p. 242).  Finally in February 1927, Gretl invited Schlick to dinner to meet Wittgenstein, after which, &quot;The next day Wittgenstein told Engelmann:  `Each of us thought the other must be mad.'  Soon after this, Wittgenstein and Schlick began to meet regularly for discussions.&quot;  (p. 242).<br />By the summer of 1927 Wittgenstein was drawn into meetings on Monday evenings which included Rudolf Carnap, who reported, &quot;His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer.&quot;  (p. 244).  Later in the book, Wittgenstein is identified with opposition to science in a form which had invaded philosophy.  &quot;You might think Aesthetics is a science telling us what's beautiful - almost too ridiculous for words.&quot;  (p. 405).  He told audiences that he was disgusted with &quot;the worship of science, and he therefore spent some time in these lectures execrating what he considered to be powerful and damaging forms of evangelism for this worship.&quot;  (p. 404).  If that makes more sense to you than anything you previously knew about philosophy, this book might be a good way to learn about philosophy.  &quot;Wittgenstein quotes two kinds of explanation from the work of Freud, which illustrate, respectively, the kind of reductive account that he thought should be avoided at all costs, and the other `style of thinking' that he was trying to promote.&quot;  (p. 405).  Wittgenstein is given credit for appreciating Freud's JOKES AND THEIR RELATIONS TO THE UNCONSCIOUS, in which &quot;One of Heine's characters, a humble lottery-agent, in boasting about his relations with Baron Rothschild, remarks:  `He treated me quite as his equal - quite familionairely'.  The reason this makes us laugh, Freud claims, . . . there is actually something rather unpleasant about being treated with a rich man's condescension.&quot;  (pp. 406-407).  Wittgenstein's aesthetic analysis of such explanations leads into a way of appreciating art.  &quot;But the important thing was that I read the poems entirely differently, more intensely, and said to others:  `Look!  This is how they should be read.' &quot;  (p. 407).<br />In the picture section, numbers 44 &amp; 45 show a post card, with a picture of &quot;The Pilgrim of Peace/ Bravo ! Mr. Chamberlain&quot; that he didn't send to anyone.  There is no address or postage stamp, but he wrote the message, &quot;In case you want an Emetic, there it is.&quot;  Signed LudW, it might be considered typical of what was considered humor on college campuses, but most of this book is on a higher level.	2003-06-03

This might be more true in Russia during the last few centuries than elsewhere, but PUSHKIN'S CHILDREN by Tatyana Tolstaya does not have an index, in which to look up Lenin, for his opinion on the intelligentsia, to illustrate the point.  The intellectual freedoms which literary people in Russia had been seeking since the time of Herzen were finally granted by Gorbachev.  But then the Partocracy, \\"accustomed to doing nothing concrete, to producing a lot of empty talk, they were shaken from their usual rut by the very mystery of what was happening.  They were so baffled that it was easy to sweep them from their posts.  When someone has fainted, you can quickly throw them out the door.\\"  (p. 44).  People who live in democracies should recognize the ability of voters to do this to rulers on a regular basis, if the voters have enough reason and are given the opportunity.<br />In the case of Gorbachev, the larger question of how he managed to preside over the collapse of an empire and an economic system is of unusual interest for people in democracies whose outlooks for wealth are not stable.  Tolstaya pictures the intelligentsia as being too moral to grasp the downside of what would happen when \\"Gorbachev made his first, and perhaps his most serious, mistake.  He forbade the people to drink.<BR>   \\"The intelligentsia forgave him for this (they were `moved by their own perdition').  The Partocracy was happy.  Here was a concrete task, and a familiar one:  to fight, to root out, to fire people from their jobs.  They set to tearing out grape vines, paving over rare vinyards in the Crimea, uprooting muscat so fine and expensive that `the people' couldn't get near it.  They only counted the monstrous losses when the campaign was over.  During the campaign, however, people cursed Gorbachev, bought up all the sugar, perfected their knowledge of moonshine manufacture, and most important of all, grasped that they could do everything their own way and not get caught or punished.  An epidemic of hoarding began.  Sugar, soap, matches, and lightbulbs disappeared, and then sheets and pillows, and then clothes, shoes, eggs, and finally bread.\\"  (p. 45).<br />Most of the people in the world live in countries where they do not need to depend on their government to supply them with such items, and even the United States, rich as it is in so many ways, might expect to be able to conquer anyplace it chooses without having to furnish such items to everybody.  Even the current road map might appear to create a state for the Palestinians in an area in which Jewish settlements are the hoarders of anything they might really want.  Long before, this book, PUSHKIN'S CHILDREN, starts with a book review of SOVIET WOMEN:  WALKING THE TIGHTROPE, by Francine du Plessix Gray, in which reality conforms to the old maxim, \\"Women can do everything, and men do all the rest.\\"  (p. 3).  War and prison camps kept men away from homes and jobs in the first half of the twentieth century.  \\"An honest person tried his or her best not to participate in this `official' life.  Those who did get involved in the hellish machine were broken:  either it destroyed all traces of individuality and compromised them morally and ethically, or--if a person rebelled--it threw him out of society, sometimes sending him as far as Siberia.\\"  (p. 11).<br />Things change as the essays in this book were written.  \\"In January 1994, no one talks about politics and no one explains anything, no matter how much I ask.  No one understands anything.  No one believes in anyone or anything.\\"  (pp. 127-128).  With incredibly high prices, \\"But there are happy surprises, too:  a medicine that I bought in America for $50 turned out to be so cheap in Russia that I bought fifteen jars and paid only five cents for it.  (I should have bought thirty jars.)\\"  (p. 128).<br />Another explanation for the collapse of the Soviet Union was in the personality conflict between its primary leaders.  \\"In February 1991, Yeltsin was dying to speak on television and Gorbachev wouldn't let him. . . . Many people understood that the conflict between these two strong personalities did in fact threaten the country with collapse--and with unforeseen consequences.\\"  (p. 147).  Then, \\"Having rushed to `seize' Russia, he didn't know what to do with it.\\"  (p. 151).  Yeltsin is pictured as dreaming that things would be better for him if he were in America.  \\"(I wonder whether, somewhere in the depths of Yeltsin's subconscious, he is remembering the last house of the last Russian tsar, given to Nikolai II by the Bolsheviks, which Yeltsin himself had blown up on orders from Moscow.)  In any event, I rather think that if an American president willfully decided to get rid of California, Nevada, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Texas, the two Virginias, both Carolinas, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, the grateful American people wouldn't build him anything more than a hut in Alaska, at best, and wouldn't give him any sled dogs either.\\"  (pp. 151-152).<br />This book is really too good.  Even if you know a lot of what this book covers, the point of view is unusual and witty enough to make it entertaining.  But in our times, even PUSHKIN'S CHILDREN has to admit, \\"Recently Americans have not shown much interest in what is going on in Russia.\\"  (pp. 185-186).  The final paragraph, dated 2000, includes the kind of things that feed current fears.  \\"Russians began to remove everything they possibly could from institutes and factories, and to sell everything they stole, including state secrets--actual, not imagined ones.  They stole poisons, mercury, uranium, cesium, and vaccines.  Even, in one instance, smallpox virus.\\"  (p. 242).  Take it from an author who \\"used to buy meat patties at some tank factory.  No one ever stopped me.\\"  (p. 242).	2003-06-02

The index is quite useful for locating significant figures, where they appear in the text most pertinently.  Nietzsche only appears once, on the way to explaining \\"the appeal of those recent thinkers--Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Richard Rorty--who owe their intellectual eminence not to their arguments but to their role in giving authority to the rejection of authority, and to their absolute commitment to the impossibility of absolute commitments.\\"  (p. 75).  Former opponents of the Western world as we know it in this book include Karl Marx, \\"Shortly after the family had been iconized by Hegel, it was satirized by Marx and Engels in THE HOLY FAMILY.  But the real intellectual war against the family is a product of the late twentieth century, and part of a great cultural shift from the affirmation to the repudiation of inherited values.\\"  (p. 70).  \\"Like Marxism, feminism purports to show us the world without ideological masks or camouflage.\\"  (p. 72).  Marx is later criticized more philosophically for starting this ball rolling.  \\"All distinctions are `cultural,' therefore `constructed,' therefore `ideological,' in the sense defined by Marx--manufactured by the ruling classes in order to serve their interests and bolster their power.  Western civilization is simply the record of that oppressive process, and the principal purpose of studying it is to deconstruct its claim to our membership.  This is the core belief that a great many students in the humanities are required to ingest, \\" (p. 79) at least until men stop signing up for liberal arts classes because they find them so offensive.<br />On the other hand, revolt in Western societies seems to play right into the hands of what the poet, Robert Bly, calls a sibling society.  Instead of a society dominated by adults able \\"to induct young people into the national culture, when loyalties no longer stretch across generations or define themselves in territorial terms, then inevitably the society of strangers, held together by citizenship, is under threat.\\"  (p. 82).  The vast media domination, assuming the primary influence of entertainment values in areas that used to be under the sway of intellectual thought, produces a society which is easily seen by the rest of the world as dominated by \\"a dissipation that is both cause and effect of the sex-and-drugs lifestyle of the modern teenager.\\"  (p. 82).<br />The fundamental point in Chapter 3, \\"Holy Law,\\" is perhaps stated most forcefully later, in Chapter 4, \\"Globalization,\\" considering how the common financial situation determining the future of the demographic explosion has not escaped ancient attitudes.  \\"There is no such entity as Iraq, only a legal fiction erected by the United Nations for the purpose of dealing with whichever individual, clique, or faction is for the moment holding the people of that country hostage.\\"  (p. 135).  Any authority which previously existed in that area takes \\"no responsibility, and can be neither praised nor blamed, but exist merely as shields and weapons in the hands of those whose advantages they secure.  This was made explicit under the Leninist system of Communist government, which was . . . shadowed by an office of the `vanguard party,' which exercised all the power but was wholly unaccountable for doing so.<BR>   \\"This too casts some light on September 11.  The attacks were designed to wound the United States in its decision-making part.\\"  (pp. 135-136).  September 11, 2001, was a near miss for the political parties who send people to the U.S. Congress.  Only those who lack political clout in the ruling party would want to point out that the financial structures and Pentagon civilians harmed in that attack were among those least likely to throw lives away in the kind of fights which previously seemed unlikely for a government which normally, \\"When it fights on their behalf it does not drag them into conflicts that are none of their business but involves them in conflicts of their own.\\"  (p. 138).  So when I look at the news, I'm still checking to see if the oil wells are safe, and who wouldn't?  This book explains things that were in the news much longer than most people have worried about them, and some of the truth in this book hurts.	2003-05-27
US	49867522	R1THDFLGUYHDNE	089526935X	743490829	Existence and Being	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Philosophy, some on poetry, with a great ending	This is a good book for introducing a form of thinking that may be called for on special occasions, when people have to consider what is not truly mundane.  My second-hand copy of this book, the Gateway edition, published 1979, based on the First American edition published 1949, begins with a long attempt to explain Heidegger's main early work, BEING AND TIME, Part I.  (1927).  Way back then &quot;only the first two out of six planned sections of the book were published.&quot;  (p. 8).  I thought that the explanation by Werner Brock took too long to get to the items by Heidegger which finally appear from page 233 to the end of this book.  As an example of the explanation for what is included, I would like to quote the following paragraph:<br />  Some of the critics seem to think that there has been a considerable change in Heidegger's outlook, if not immediately after the publication of &quot;Being and Time,&quot; at least since the first essay on Hoelderlin (1936).  I for one do not share in this opinion.  In my view, the themes of all the four essays, but especially of the two philosophical ones, are directly and most intimately related to &quot;Being and Time,&quot; but not so much to the first two published Sections as rather to the third one on &quot;Time and Being.&quot;  (p. 119).<br />Heidegger's Inaugural Lecture, &quot;What is Metaphysics?&quot; is included at the end of this book.  On page 349, an undated &quot;Postscript&quot; admits that &quot;The question `What is Metaphysics?' remains a question.  For those who persevere with this question the following postscript is more of a foreword.&quot;  The obstacles encountered in the preceding lecture are described as &quot;good.  It will make our questioning more genuine.&quot;  (p. 351).  The first of the &quot;misgivings and misconceptions to which the lecture gives rise&quot; has been &quot;The lecture makes `Nothing' the sole subject of metaphysics.&quot;  (p. 352).  The other problems are explained as mood problems we acquire when we do not &quot;shut our ears to the soundless voice which attunes us to the horrors of the abyss&quot; (p. 354) through such a concept.  &quot;Without Being, whose unfathomable and manifest essence is vouchsafed us by Nothing in essential dread, everything that `is' would remain in Beinglessness.&quot;  (pp. 353-354).<br />After long consideration of &quot;Nothing, conceived as the pure `Other' than what-is, is the veil of Being,&quot; (p. 360) comes some ancient Greek described as the last poem of a tragedy, &quot;Oedipus in Colonos&quot; by Sophocles, and at last, an English translation that also seems fair enough to be remembered on Memorial Day, 2003:<br />But cease now, and nevermore<br />Lift up the lament:<br />For all this is determined.	2003-05-26
US	49867522	R3LT9X9LIK1C9L	0930407490	476644401	Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul	Books	4	5	23	N	N	A lovely life, beautifully pictured	This is a beautiful book.  I expected that, but there isn't an index, so it is difficult for me to see at a glance what else I might learn from this book.  The notes are extremely brief, mainly to give page numbers in MEMORIES, DREAMS, REFLECTIONS by C. G. Jung much more than any of his other works, or to give page numbers in the two volumes of his letters, plus THE FREUD/JUNG LETTERS, and the compilation published by The Analytical Psychology Club of San Francisco, Inc. in 1982, C. G. JUNG, EMMA JUNG, TONI WOLFF.  In the contents at the beginning, we find that in Part 1, Wounded, there are two pages for \\"Toni,\\" and in Part 2, Healer, pages 101-05 for \\"Helpers:  Emma, Toni,\\" and in Part 3, Of the Soul, pages 141-47 for \\"Answer to Job\\" and pages 169-172 for \\"Toni,\\" who died suddenly in her sleep at the age of 65.  The caption of the picture on page 170 states, \\"Although Jung tried to get Toni Wolff's scientific writings published after her death in 1953, as yet they remain unpublished.\\"  But sometimes things change faster than photo captions, and Jung managed to write an introduction \\"When Toni's STUDIES IN JUNGIAN PSYCHOLOGY was published.\\"  (p. 171).  Jung destroyed \\"Toni's letters to him and his to her.\\"<br />Shortly before Walter Kaufmann died in September, 1980, he finished work on the third volume of DISCOVERING THE MIND, which he called FREUD VERSUS ADLER AND JUNG.  As a philosophy professor, Kaufmann sought sound scholarship, innovative science, a well-organized writing style, and the sort of penetrating self-knowledge that he was used to from all the work he did on Nietzsche.  The first page of section 70 of his book, page 397, explains how Jung achieved success without being particularly profound, by failing in ways that enhanced his popularity, a strategy that ultimately might be considered more professional than scientists can claim to be.  He quotes Jung as someone who, \\"much more even than Adler, became a guru\\" to a group that expects professionalism above all:  \\"About a third of my cases are not suffering from any clinically definable neurosis, but from the senselessness and aimlessness of their lives. . . . Over two thirds of my patients are in the second half of life.\\"<br />As a mere philosophy professor, Kaufmann never benefited from having a consistent publisher for his own work, though coming out in paperback made it possible for his translations of Nietzsche to be fully successful.  Most of his page 397 is about books.  \\"Among Jung's patients were wealthy American women, eager to do something for the cause.  Eventually, the publication of his collected works, in English and German, was subsidized, and the volumes were produced very beautifully and underpriced, and then also made available in extremely attractive paperbacks.\\"  Though CARL JUNG:  WOUNDED HEALER OF THE SOUL/ AN ILLUSTRATED BIOGRAPHY by Claire Dunne (who was born in Ireland, lived in Australia, and founded two Australian multicultural radio stations) is not entirely the work of women, it is as attractive as any that could describe itself as \\"--the book is itself a work of art, the kind of enduring tome which is picked up again and again for the pleasure of the eyes as well as that of the mind.\\"  (back cover, Olivier Bernier, \\"who directs the Van Waveren Foundation, was the first to acknowledge the manuscript with a publication development grant.\\" Acknowledgments, p. 218).<br />The picture on page 104 which shows Freud and C. G. Jung standing, with Emma Jung and Toni Wolff seated in front of them at the Third International Psychoanalytic Congress, 1911, also shows an arm of Lou Andreas-Salome at the edge of the picture by Freud, as more of the same picture is displayed on page 136 in JUNG A BIOGRAPHY by Gerhard Wehr, translated from the German by David M. Weeks.  The latter, hefty biography of Jung, for whom \\"the superindividual was paramount\\" (Wehr, p. 4) has an index of names on pages 539-549, with the number of listings for Toni Wolff taking2 lines as only a few names, like Alfred Adler, Jesus Christ, and Friedrich Nietzsche do.  Sigmund Freud and Aniela Jaffe each need 3 lines in the index of Wehr's book, which seems to devote much more to Jung's work than to his life.  People who are more interested in what kept Jung motivated should see the picture of Toni Wolff on page 50 of Claire Dunne's book, dated December 1930.  I'll bet she was about 44 years old then, when Jung was 55, and thought she was only 42.  Some people aren't good with numbers, at that age, but people who are likely to buy this book don't have to be adept at math.	2003-03-10
US	49867522	R11VLRAJFUWA6	0804736480	781986560	Unpublished Writings from the period of Unfashionable Observations: Volume 11 (The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche)	Books	5	7	13	N	N	Has a great index, notes, and an afterword.	The value of this book depends entirely on the ability of the reader to think about it.  I happened to enjoy it as confirmation of many efforts I have previously made to understand Nietzsche and the world at large, and this review pays far too much attention to the world, which is as at large as ever.<br />Long ago, I had the opportunity to consider what Nietzsche thought about a normal appreciation for the truth, compared to the opposite which he discovered in what was most forceful.  \\"When the Christian crusaders in the Orient encountered the invincible order of Assassins, . . . whose lowest ranks followed a rule of obedience the like of which no order of monks ever attained, they obtained in some way or other a hint concerning that symbol and watchword reserved for the highest ranks alone as their secretum:  `Nothing is true, everything is permitted.' \\"  (ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS, translated by Walter Kaufmann, p. 150).  This collection of notebooks of private thoughts, which Nietzsche did not publish, reflect the process in which he prepared his work.  Trying to find some secret doctrine, which the public could never understand, seems to be like trying to understand everything, as dangerous as any other aspect of his thought.<br />In 1872 or early 1873, he had written, \\"Conversely, we are returning to culture in a sectarian manner, we are trying once again to suppress the philosopher's immeasurable knowledge and convince him of the anthropomorphic character of all knowledge.\\"  (p. 57).  This is so true, I need only mention GENIUS by Harold Bloom, in which \\"A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds\\" are explained by classifications which seek to glorify how individuals think.  Otherwise, in our culture, \\"Groupthink is the blight of our Age of Information, and is most pernicious in our obsolete academic institutions, whose long suicide since 1967 continues.  The study of mediocrity, whatever its origins, breeds mediocrity.\\"  (Bloom, p. ix).<br />When Nietzsche was becoming an expert in Greek civilization, learning about the Pre-Platonic philosophers, a battle was fought at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, early in July, 1863.  The Confederacy lost that battle, but in 1870-1871, the newly united states of Germany, under Prussia, having organized its troops for rapid deployment, had triumphed in a war with France.  Long years of division and deprivation had prepared Germany to become the economic powerhouse which it is today, third in the world, following the United States and Japan.  In the monetary system of the world, the dollar, the yen, and now the euro are the leading currencies.  The state of financial collapse which is now a threat to the dominance of globalization is best imagined by considering Iraq like Gettysburg, a battle dragged out for years instead of days, in which the United States, the chief invader (England was the foreign power which offered the most support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War), has managed to remain in the area, which it considers a battlefield on which it may yet triumph.  In his notebook, Nietzsche sought the \\"Value of truthfulness. --It does indeed improve things!  Its aim is decline.  It sacrifices.  Our art is the likeness of desperate knowledge.\\"  (p. 57)<br />Though Nietzsche has been dead for over a hundred years, the range of his thought is accessible to people who are willing to search within themselves for whatever is the matter with their situations.  Trouble?  I could show you trouble.  Compared to the twentieth century, thinking about America in Iraq seems to be the most hopeful way to go for anyone who has hoped for money, or oil, or power, or the opportunity to be right in a way that the world can't deny.  But Nietzsche went looking into the big question, and found:<br />\\"When among the tumult at the outbreak of the last great war an embittered French scholar called the Germans barbarians and accused them of lacking culture, people in Germany still listenedclosely enough to take deep offense at this; and it gave many journalists the opportunity to polish brightly the armor of their culture, . . . and venerable Carlyle publicly praised precisely those qualities in the Germans and, for the sake of these qualities, gave their victory his blessing, then everyone was clear about German culture; and after the experience of success, it was certainly quite innocuous to speak of the victory of German culture.  Today, when the Germans have enough time to examine in retrospect many of the words flung at us then, there are probably a few who recognize that the Frenchman was right:  the Germans are barbarians, despite all those human qualities.\\"  (p. 93).  The distinction Nietzsche would like to draw is regarding the future:  \\"the hope for an emerging culture vindicates the Germans:  whereas one gives no deference to a degenerate and exhausted culture.\\"  (p. 93).  It is necessary to look in another book to find the phrase of Goethe which Nietzsche was to include in his published work.  \\"But another couple of centuries may have to pass before our countrymen will have absorbed sufficient spirit and higher culture for one to be able to say of them:  it has been a long time since they were barbarians.\\"  (UNFASHIONABLE OBSERVATIONS, p. 10).  Since the United States bombed bridges and buildings in Europe in 1999 to react to a civil war in which a ruling party there seemed uncivilized to us, perhaps the stance of the German and French people today tries to seem more cultured than the Americans as their last, best hope to avoid the terrorists that can do far more to hasten the decline of civilization than America would acting alone.closely enough to take deep offense at this; and it gave many journalists the opportunity to polish brightly the armor of their culture, . . . and venerable Carlyle publicly praised precisely those qualities in the Germans and, for the sake of these qualities, gave their victory his blessing, then everyone was clear about German culture; and after the experience of success, it was certainly quite innocuous to speak of the victory of German culture.

Trying to compare Blake's complaints about death being the ultimate form of persuasion in the disputes of his day, religious though they might seem to us at this late date, with the doctrines that the authors of the items in this book are willing to contemplate, tends to make our own times seem unexciting, but it doesn't have to be this way.  Now that so many people have computers with printers and numerous other methods of communicating with people all over the world, the stage is set for becoming familiar with the way that ideas in books and people interact to produce greater individuality, as can be shown in the crumbling of all kinds of organizations which relied on the authority of old doctrines, as resulted from the works of Blake and Swedenborg.  We have this example of people who have already devoted much thought to the attempt to study the combination of the two, and this is precisely the kind of thing which we ought to understand best.<br />This book, BLAKE AND SWEDENBORG/ OPPOSITION IS TRUE FRIENDSHIP, edited by Harvey F. Bellin and Darrell Ruhl, is a collection.  Many of the articles and lectures are short.  Most compare the writings of William Blake with the doctrines of Emanuel Swedenborg.  Many of the people mentioned in the book were known to Blake, either at the formation of a church in 1789 in London, where Blake spent most of his life, or later, and where, much earlier, Swedenborg's books were printed due to religious restrictions imposed by the government of Sweden.  Prior to reaching the age of 50, Swedenborg had been accepted as a leading member of society, who co-edited Sweden's first scientific journal in 1716, but his religious books were published anonymously.  It should be noted that both Blake and Swedenborg \\"Self-published\\" (p. 6) the books for which they are known today, without commercial recognition in their own time, and that each saw instances in which society condemned people forbelieving more than was fashionable or proper.  Much of this book is devoted to the doctrine of predestination, or however God might determine who could be considered saved, one way or another, society then being less inclined to take a comic view concerning that theological question than we are currently used to.<br />There are two engravings by Blake in color on the cover of BLAKE AND SWEDENBORG.  The illustrations scattered throughout the remainder of the book are in black and white.  On page 42 is a stark \\"Anatomical reference from Swedenborg's THE CEREBRUM,\\" possibly one of the volumes referred to in the text:  \\"In 1743-44, Swedenborg compiled a staggering four-volume treatise, THE BRAIN.  In it, he was the first to discover the functions of the cerebellum, pituitary gland and spinal fluid, the localization of thinking and memory in the cerebral cortex, and the integrative action of the nervous system.\\"  (p. 42).  It was then that \\"a new muse began to emerge, sending seismic shock waves to the very core of this objective man of the Age of Reason.  The process started with a series of disturbing dreams, which he carefully recorded in a private journal.\\"  (p. 42).<br />The early short sections of BLAKE AND SWEDENBORG offer a lot of comparisons, with Swedenborg much more familiar \\"with leading scientists and scholars in Sweden, England, Holland, France, Germany, Italy, and Bohemia\\" than Blake, who was apprenticed to an engraver after studying at Pars School of Drawing (1767-1772), but was then a \\"student at Royal Academy Schools (1779).\\"  (p. 5).  The discoveries of Blake were of states of mind, now considered \\"mythology, personifying aspects of consciousness\\" or in the area of printing.  Blake also \\"Discovered an acid-etching process for creating relief-type, copper printing plates.\\"  (p. 6).<br />My high opinion of Blake is due to MILTON :  A POEM, BLAKE'S ILLUMINATED BOOKS :  VOLUME 5, whose hero is famous for the great poem, \\"Paradise Lost,\\" describing Satan more fully than most people know themselves.  MILTON is mentioned occasionally in BLAKE AND SWEDENBORG, and, most importantly, for mentioning Swedenborg on pages 16, 29 and 153, where MILTON A POEM is quoted:<br />O Swedenborg!  strongest of men, the Samson<BR>   shorn by the Churches,<BR>Shewing the Transgressors in Hell, the proud<BR>   Warriors in Heaven,<BR>Heaven as a punisher, & Hell as One under Punishment.<br />The cosmic scheme in which Blake seems to be describing the spirit world he might have adopted from Swedenborg seems most complete in \\"Opposition Is True Friendship\\" (1985) by Harvey F. Bellin, which spends pages 39-43 on Swedenborg's life and pages 43-48 on ` \\"A Theatre Representative of the Lord's Kingdom\\" Swedenborg's Theology.'  \\"The Swedenborgian Songs\\" (1968) by Kathleen Raine discusses the themes of Blake's SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE, with attention to the poem \\"For Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love\\" which I found mentioned on pages 78, 88 (in \\"The Human Face of God\\" (1985) by Kathleen Raine), 111 (in \\"New Light on C. A. Tulk\\" by Raymond H. Deck, Jr.), 149 (in \\"Blake and Swedenborg\\" (undated, from THE NEW CHURCH HERALD XXX, London) by H.N. Morris).  The Contents are divided into \\"Analyses of Blake's Connections to Swedenborg,\\" \\"Historical Contexts,\\" and \\"Swedenborgian Postscripts,\\" but much of the material seems to be covered from the same point of view.  For excitement, reading Blake alone might be better, but this view offers a deeper understanding, and the opposition which Blake expressed in his satire of Swedenborg, THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL, (c. 1790-93) might free some people from doctrines which seemed necessary, or previously conformed to their idea of sanity.	2003-03-03

McNamara started churning out books about Nam.  There had been a lot of books about Nam up to that point, and what struck me was how much had been left out of all of them.  Since this book called itself the complete story, and listed the author's home town and zip code, I wrote to the author, asking if he could send me any funny Nam bits for MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK.  It was difficult for me to believe that Wilbur Morrison was smart enough to know how much of his book I hadn't read and still write to tell me that Nam had no humor, the American forces in Vietnam entirely lacked anything to joke about, and I should do more reading.  Thinking `What does he know?' I then wrote to Robert S. McNamara, promising to give him full credit for any funny Nam bits he could send me, though MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK wasn't really that kind of joke book, it was more about things that a 19-year-old grunt might say that would never find its way between the covers of any book more historical than DISPATCHES by Michael Herr.  I even remembered a joke that I hadn't heard in Nam:  What do you call a guy with no arms and no legs when he's swimming?  Bob, of course, though you might not call him Bob to his face if he were the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America.  Did Bob even know what Nixon was saying when the White House Transcripts book said, \\"That was national security, because it had to do with the (expletive deleted) Vietnam war\\" ? (President to John Dean, March, 1973, when a cancer on the presidency was all the rage).<br />There is a point in THE ELEPHANT AND THE TIGER when I definitely thought that something was left out, possibly because those who supplied the official information thought it was necessary to sanitize it.  In November, 1946, something happened in Haiphong which does not get mentioned, but by December, Morrison reports that the Viet Minh were retaliating for something by engaging in open warfare against Frenchtroops.  If this book was really complete, every reader would be informed what the Vietnamese thought they were retaliating against, and would not be surprised, not even as surprised as some Americans were by the ceasefire Tet offensive in 1968, which was designed to show that if anyone in Nam didn't know what was going to happen, it was sure to be the Americans.  That might not be funny in America, but by 1968, I'll bet the French were able to laugh, and they might still be laughing.	2003-03-01

This collection of DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER and other writings from the Swedenborg Foundation Publishers, edited by Gregory R. Johnson, which puts everything that directly related to KANT ON SWEDENBORG into this book, allows a serious consideration of Johnson's view that self-defense was the essence of Kant's approach.  Religious controversies had career consequences in those days, and Kant had to show he was laughing \\"because Swedenborg was a controversial figure.  Rumors of interest in Swedenborg would have seriously jeopardized Kant's prospects for academic advancement.  This is sufficient motive for him to write a book exculpating himself of the suspicion that he took Swedenborg seriously.\\"  (p. xvi).  Johnson was writing a doctoral dissertation on Kant the first time he read DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER in 1994, and he cites it in the notes as his COMMENTARY, (Washington, D.C.:  The Catholic University of America, 2001).  The acknowledgments are dated January 2003 (p. xxvi) and I feel lucky that I received this book as soon as I did.<br />I have been thinking about this book for a long time before I wrote this review, since this is the work for which Kant wondered if he had gone too far in jest.  My first surprise was that Kant himself (like Hegel, he avoids mentioning names) is not entirely clear about whom he meant to be writing until page 49: \\"I come now to my purpose, namely, to the writings of my hero.\\"  He called his preface \\"A Prospectus That Promises Very Little for the Project\\" (p. 3) and the final paragraph of his introduction attempted to make his readers share the situation which he found himself in.  \\"Furthermore, a large work was purchased, and, what is worse still, was read, and such effort should not be wasted.  From this originated the present treatise, which, as one flatters oneself, should leave the reader in a state of complete satisfaction, in which the principal part will not be understood, the other not believed, and the remainder laughed at.\\"  (p. 4).  In general, I approve of the steps Kant took to show a more enlightened view than the journals of his day.  The major contrast in Johnson's Introduction is with Johann August Ernesti, who denounced Swedenborg in 1760 as a heretic in his \\"New Theological Library.\\"  For attempting to find meanings in the early books of the Bible which were not obvious, Swedenborg was accused of \\"pervert[ing] the Sacred Scriptures by the pretense of an inner sense, is in the highest degree worthy of punishment.\\"  (p. xxiv).  When someone in Wurttemberg published a book on Swedenborg, \\"at Ernesti's urging, the Wurttemberg government declared the book heretical, confiscated all copies, and even ordered private citizens to surrender their copies on pain of arrest.\\"  (p. xxv).  When a professor of Theology at Tubingen \\"urged a more open-minded attitude toward Swedenborg[,] Ernesti responded with yet another scathing review, asserting that Clemm's defense of Oetinger and Swedenborg was an offense that would have been worthy of the death penalty in earlier times.\\"  (p. xxv).  Kant shows how modern people could be much more philosophical about these things, and though those people are all dead, there is a nice justice in the number of people who are still reading Kant and Swedenborg, even if they hardly know anyone else who does.<br />The prime point in the Introduction by Johnson resides deep in personal philosophy, that professional philosophers might understand as, \\"that Kant's mature critical philosophy is best seen as a synthesis of Rousseauian and Swedenborgian elements (the influence of Leibniz and Hume being primarily upon Kant's elaboration of difficult technical questions once his basic vision was already in place).  . . . although Kant's vision of the cosmos is more Swedenborgian than Rousseauian, it is Rousseau who provides the essentially pragmatic arguments that allow Kant to embrace the content of Swedenborg's visions but discard his enthusiasm.\\"  (p. xx).<br />The notes are helpful.  Only a translator is likely to notice, \\"Here Kant embraces the idea of general as opposed to particular providence.\\" (p. 161, n. 26).  This is what makes Kant a philosopher, \\"the notion that God governs the universe by framing general laws.  Particular providence is the notion that he governs the universe on a case-by-case basis.\\"  Swedenborg is so religious that he argues \\"general providence is meaningless without particular providence.\\"  There is more on this in Johnson's (as yet, unpublished) COMMENTARY.  Kant [Part I, Second Chapter, Paragraph 3] was talking about connections in the immaterial world, the former connections, before getting trapped where \\"nothing hinders even the immaterial beings that affect one another through the mediation of matter from also standing in a special and constant association and as immaterial beings always exercising reciprocal influences on one another, so that their relationship mediated by matter is only contingent and rests upon particular divine provision, whereas the former is natural and indissoluble.\\"  (p. 16)<br />I would like to check another translation to see if this is even close to what anyone else would think.  In 1992, David Walford and Ralf Meerbote had their translation published in Kant, THEORETICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1755-1770.  \\"Walford's translation is highly accurate and very readable.  Indeed, it would be hard to justify a new translation of DREAMS at all were the Walford translation available in an inexpensive paperback edition.\\"  (p. xxiii).  It soon might be, if that is what you would rather have.	2003-02-21

I am liberal enough to think that the worst aspect of law is the role that the government has assumed in attempting to set limits on the pleasure-seeking nature of American society, making itself the ultimate confiner of anyone who dares to commit petty offenses, particularly people who are self-treating themselves with drugs (\\"marijuana, felony possession of, collateral consequences, 5,\\" is an entry in the index of this book) which are now available in the form of a chemical equivalent with a prescription from a physician.  The social context of such draconian  measures are the subject of INVISIBLE PUNISHMENT/ THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF MASS IMPRISONMENT, edited by Marc Mauer and Meda Chesney-Lind.<br />My favorite chapter is by Meda Chesney-Lind, \\"Imprisoning Women:  The Unintended Victims of Mass Imprisonment.\\"  As an enormous portion of American society which generally can be considered non-threatening to anyone who is not afraid of being called a heterosexist male chauvinist pig, women have typically conformed to whatever behavior has been most socially acceptable, and the crimes mentioned most often in this book ought to be considered more pathetic than anything else.  The factors (I'll stop listing these when I get to the word \\"random\\") which seem out of place in any society which would consider itself liberal include the following:<br />\\"get tough\\" sentencing policies (p. 79)<br />\\"vengeful equity\\" (p. 80)<br />the number of women incarcerated in prisons and jails in the United States is now about ten times greater than the number of women incarcerated in all of Western Europe.  (p. 81)<br />far higher rates of physical and sexual abuse (p. 83)<br />the criminalization of girls' survival strategies, such as running away from home (p. 84)<br />working in retail may actually increase their involvement in certain property crimes, much like women's employment in bar and entertainment outlets often increases women's likelihood of getting involved in prostitution and drug abuse. (p. 85)<br />because they made so little money, 20 percent of the active women dealers reported twenty or more drug deals per day.  (pp. 85-86)<br />women's deteriorating economic conditions (p. 86)<br />increased penalties (mandatory sentences) for drug offenses (p. 88)<br />Many women are being returned to prison not for new offenses but for technical parole violations because they fail to pass random drug tests.

I find it difficult, now, but not because anything which is says is any less true than it ever was.  As history goes, it is some of the most thoughtful.  The problem is that we are no longer living in history.  Comparing ourselves to the contents of this book confirms that society is now at the level of farce, and likely to remain so.  This conclusion might not strike anyone starting the book for the first time, but it ought to grab anyone who is capable of comprehending Chapter 3, &quot;Luther's Conception of the Calling.&quot;<br />My point of view works best if it is accepted that, as America now stands, it can only be understood as a nation of shoppers.  The large and still growing amount by which imports exceeds exports requires that the entire world maintains this view for monetary stability.  The political parties might pretend to be theoretically split between those who use the government as a means of shopping for people's needs and those who would enhance the ability to make big bucks, but neither party can, in actuality, represent with their whole heart those who picture government as the ultimate shopper, which ought to be able to provide people with what they would not otherwise have, whether through liberal social programs or by imposing rigid security provisions and covert activities.  Thinking about how well secret military tribunals or jailing users of illegal substances actually functions, as applied to &quot;others,&quot; strike me as being an absurd application of Luther's &quot;observation that the division of labour forces every individual to work for others.&quot;  Both parties, to maintain their existence in such a tipsy world, must appeal to those who would maintain &quot;the privileged position, legal or actual, of single great trading companies.&quot;  Only the American ability to convince the world that everyone who takes our money for their products fully shares the ability of Americans to benefit from such great wealth can maintain such a situation as &quot;a traditionalist interpretation based on the idea of Providence.  The individual should remain once and for all in the station and calling in which God had placed him, and should restrain his worldly activity within the limits imposed by his established station in life.  While his economic traditionalism was originally the result of Pauline indifference, it later became that of a more and more intense belief in divine providence, which identified absolute obedience to God's will, with absolute acceptance of things as they were.&quot;  The uses of two &quot;Absolute&quot;s in that sentence is what frightens me.  Any sign of inability to adapt to a future which includes vast changes is a bad characteristic for a modern society, and the modern economy seems to be headed in a direction that will no longer provide great wealth to all who expect it.  In such a situation, anyone might consider the words of Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; as quoted by Max Weber, which points out that people are able:<br />To leave this Paradise, but shall possess<br />A Paradise within thee, happier far.<br />The next paragraph suggests, &quot;The appeal to national character is generally a mere confession of ignorance, and in this case it is entirely untenable.&quot;  The difference between what Max Weber is trying to describe and what I'm thinking is what makes this kind of book so difficult to read, and I wouldn't be surprised if you haven't read it.who takes our money for their products fully shares the ability of Americans to benefit from such great wealth can maintain such a situation as &quot;a traditionalist interpretation based on the idea of Providence.

US	49867522	RTEFCSYBOJP85	0674817362	532490719	The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations (Belknap Press S)	Books	4	9	57	N	N	Now that we are this book, here's what I say:	Everything is bad news if it comes with a deadline that isn't met.  This book, THE SOLDIER AND THE STATE:  THE THEORY AND POLITICS OF CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS by Samuel P. Huntington, a young Harvard professor in 1957, when the book first appeared, attempted to establish assumptions that would allow respectable consideration of policies that, in our world, might be used to define who we have become.  My differences with this book might be ascribed to a theological framework in which this book is seen as having assumed the existence of hell on earth as the situation which people who voiced political aspirations that did not coincide with the prevailing superpower mentality would have to put up with.  The famous Winston Churchill once said something about assumptions up with which he would not put, and the success of this book might be measured by how its views are assumed to be the American views in those parts of the world where America as a superpower is most unpopular.<br />This review is being written in a short window of time in which the rulers of Saudi Arabia, whose success, so far, has been contingent on the opposite of liberal policies (they previously granted religious authorities who were considered the most conservative element within Arabian society a veto power over anything the government might do) are hoping that an American victory in Iraq might allow all American troops to be removed from Saudi Arabia, so that democracy might be granted to the people of Saudi Arabia (at a time when the average age is 15 years old) without fear that the anti-American views of Arabian young people will be the dominating political force determining the shape of the parties who will soon be able to demand more control than their government has ever been able to apply to society.  As the situation in Venezuela at the moment illustrates, fights over how much oil is being pumped, and who ought to benefit from the economic miracle that oil provides, can do strange things ina nation with a democracy that attempts to let a majority of the people rule.<br />Huntington considers America an exception to such class considerations.  Though not specifically concerned with the role of Blacks in American society, he assumes that their politics has been entirely liberal in nature.  \\"No nascent group ever developed a radical ideology challenging the established order:  it was always too quickly assimilated into that order. . . . Radicalism and conservatism were equally superfluous.  Incipient and established groups both adhered to liberalism.\\"  (p. 145).  The few attempts to establish conservative values in American history were mainly ignored by a society that was exuberantly growing in spite of any ideology which might attempt to exercise some form of control.  The early part of the twentieth century had produced few instances in which policy had needed an exit strategy, and any attempt to find one in the index of THE SOLDIER AND THE STATE leads to the following entries:<br />Expertise, a characteristic of a profession, 8-9; of officership, 11-14<br />Extirpation, U.S. policy of, 155-156<br />Even page 154 has a bit on professionalism.  As Woodrow Wilson said during World War I, \\"America has always boasted that she could find men to do anything.  She is the prize amateur nation in the world.  Germany is the prize professional nation in the world.  Now, when it comes to doing new things and doing them well, I will back the amateur against the professional every time.\\"  The lure of popularity in a liberal society can easily produce this result.  \\"In domestic politics each liberal group tends to identify the military with its own particular enemies.  Without any recognized function in a liberal society and standing outside the ideological consensus, the military have been a universal target group.\\"  (p. 154).  Extirpation is the name given to such a policy in this book.  \\"Liberalism's injunction to the military has in effect been:  conform or die.  On the one hand, American liberalism has supported the virtual elimination of all institutions of violence and thus has attempted to do away with the problem of civil-military relations entirely.  This is a policy of extirpation.  On the other hand, when it has been necessary to maintain armed force, American liberalism has insisted upon a rigorous subjective civilian control, the refashioning of the military institutions along liberal lines so that they lose their peculiarly military characteristics.  This is a policy of transmutation.\\"  (p. 155).  There are no entries in the index for hyperbolic topics like sex, soldiers, or swearing, so there is little opportunity in this book for the ideas which strike me most, considering the unique psychic characteristics of the transmutation of the typical swinging Richard into a short-term ...assassin at Waco, Texas on April 19, 1993, or less notoriously, of any Naval doctor who kept a copy of the Kennedy autopsy photographs at Bethesda Naval Hospital in the ten years after this book first appeared, but I'm convinced that such ideas are within the realm of what is considered conservative in this book.  Some people are sick of this kind of thing, and keep projecting its insanity on me, of all people, who tries to keep tying everything to the new direction of American society.  I wonder if this makes us the entertainment capital of the world, or what?	2003-02-09
US	49867522	R15L5KXMVMUZZE	0060186267	334558087	The Pope and the Heretic: The True Story of Giordano Bruno, the Man Who Dared to Defy the Roman Inquisition	Books	3	2	15	N	N	Perfecting Pontius Pilate	Understanding this book as a cheap detective novel is playing to the down side of things. If you really want to like this book, try thinking of the song, \\"True Colors\\" by Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg, most famously done by Cyndi Lauper and available with a lot of popular hits on the CD \\"Twelve Deadly Cyns.\\" The first line of that song, \\"You with the sad eyes,\\" also reminds me of the poem \\"Woman, Why Do You Weep?\\" at the end of HUNDRED WHITE DAFFODILS by Jane Kenyon, which was not published during Jane's lifetime and will never be as famous as a pop hit like \\"True Colors\\" (I remember some Paris concert where the crowd could sing the words to \\"True Colors,\\" and you could see it on videotape, but you can only get the regular video on DVD). Typically emotional in that song is the line, \\"If this world makes you crazy and you've taken all you can bear, you call me up because you know I'll be there.\\" (Copyright 1986, and this isn't really fair use of those lyrics, because this is not a paid, professional commercial for the contents of that song.)<br />Fortunately for our sanity, the church of our times is no longer imposing punishments in a manner which might now be more expected from secret military tribunals or the war on drugs as waged outside the jurisdiction of the world's greatest superpower. In THE POPE & THE HERETIC by Michael White, the church at Rome seems to have learned from the Bible how to excuse itself in the manner of Pontius Pilate, and its official condemnation of Giordano Bruno on February 8, 1600 required another hearing on the same day. \\"This hearing was called because the Holy See never sentenced heretics to the stake directly; with characteristic hypocrisy it always passed that duty on to a civil authority. The official statement from the Holy Office to the governor of Rome was invariable: `Take him [the heretic] under your jurisdiction, subject to your decision, so as to be punished with the due chastisement; beseeching you, however, as we do earnestly beseech you, so to mitigate the severity of your sentence with respect to his body that there may be no danger of death or of the shedding of blood. So we Cardinals, Inquisitor and General, whose names are written beneath decree.' This statement was effectively an order to the secular court. They were to take Bruno and burn him alive.\\" (pp. 4-5). Only after sentence had been passed did the bishop of Sidonia take away his priest's insignia \\"and condemned his soul to suffer the perpetual flames of Hell, symbolically degrading his spirit just as the flames would degrade his physical body. The cardinals and the secular judges wanted to erase the very essence of this heretic, just as of all heretics.\\" (p. 5). The rest of the book attempts to describe the true colors of Bruno in terms that a popular audience, certainly not as committed to the laws of science or jurisprudence as professionals in those fields would be, can easily understand.<br />The society of the late 16th century was exciting in a lot of ways, and this book attempts to capture that excitement more than any philosophical doctrine or memory techniques that Bruno had developed. Even modern science is only mentioned as an average person might be able to picture it. \\"To a degree, scientists began to conceptualize as Bruno had done, rather than only as Galileo had taught them. . . . The best example of this comes from the work of one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century, Richard Feynman, who created what have become known as Feynmann diagrams, pictorial representations of complex subnuclear transactions. And Bruno's vision of picture logic is actually used by almost everyone in the industrialized world each day, for we live in a world dominated by computers, and computers are machines that generate images.\\" (p. 197).<br />My favorite part of this book is about Giovanni Mocenigo, who invited Bruno to Venice in 1591. (p. 35). There were \\"three popes between the death of Sixtus V in August 1590and the accession of Clement VIII in February 1592,\\" (p. 36, n. 1) providing the kind of confusion in which \\"we can only assume magnified self-confidence and an exaggerated sense of self-worth provided him with the strength he needed. He was blind to the genuine dangers and believed he would find acceptance and leniency.\\" (p. 37). As a superpower, America seemed to feel the same way after WWII, just before Americans stopped talking about the real situation. To get his work printed, Bruno had to go to Frankfurt. He was packing on May 22, 1592, when Mocenigo \\"began to complain that I had not taught him what I promised. Then he used threats saying he would find means, if I did not remain of my own free will, to compel me.\\" (p. 44). America has been about that unlucky, trying to teach the rest of the world what democracy is supposed to be like, when Americans themselves are prevented from interfering with operations of the CIA or whatever else passes for American foreign policy in the dark corners of the night. You might find some other lesson in this book if you are reading it in a prison while serving time for possession of some illegal substance, but it ought to be showing you the true color of something.	2003-02-06

For philosophical completeness, the book GIANTS AND DWARFS:  ESSAYS 1960-1990 includes a translation of Plato's dialogue &quot;Hipparchus or the Profiteer&quot; translated by Steven Forde, in which the question of aim arises early:<br />COMRADE:  The profiteer, Socrates, thinks he ought to make a profit from everything.<BR>SOCRATES:  Don't answer me so aimlessly, as though you had suffered some injustice from someone, but pay attention to me and answer as though I asked you again from the beginning:  don't you agree that the profiteer knows about the worth of this thing from which he considers it worthwhile to make a profit?  (p. 95)<br />The comments of Allan Bloom, in searching for &quot;profound possibilities of human life&quot; (p. 105) in the origins of political philosophy, also caution us to learn &quot;of the capital importance of the virtue of moderation in the political thought of the ancient authors.&quot;  (p. 105).  Keeping everything political is the surest way of convincing American readers that we are not really talking about saintly characters, so we might easily agree with Socrates &quot;that the one making the reproach is himself of the same sort.&quot;  (p. 104).  Bloom has been leading up to this view in his discussion of Shakespeare's &quot;Richard II.&quot;  &quot;Knowledge of political things brings with it the awareness that in order for the sacred to become sacred terrible deeds must be done.  Because God does not evidently rule, the founder of justice cannot himself be just.&quot;  (p. 93).<br />The Preface attempts to explain where Bloom has been coming from, and I appreciate the mention of Nietzsche on the last page of the Preface as a guide to understanding the nature of the intellectual contrasts which this book expects from Lemuel Gulliver, Xenophon, Socrates, Rousseau, Plato, and Leo Strauss.  The Address delivered at Harvard University on December 7, 1988, is a prime example of the complex and fascinating psychology of democracy.  (p. 13).  After Bloom's book, THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND, was a big hit, Allan Bloom became a professor identified with &quot;American anti-intellectualism&quot; for trying to preserve thought about our heritage from the political antielitists seeking a uniform view in the humanities.<br />At the time of THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND, I was most interested in seeing that book as a failure to consider the intellectual power of rock 'n' roll.  GIANTS AND DWARFS contains a translation of Plato's dialogue &quot;Ion or On the Iliad&quot; translated by Allan Bloom, with his discussion of it.  The cultural significance of a contest of rhapsodes dedicated to a god was not despised by Socrates, who &quot;often envied you rhapsodes, Ion, for your art.  For that it befits your art for the body to be always adorned and for you to appear as beautiful as possible, and that, at the same time, it is necessary to be busy with many good poets and above all with Homer, the best and most divine of poets, and to learn his thought thoroughly, not just his words, is enviable.&quot;  (pp. 124).  Ion is the prize-winning expert at reciting Homer dramatically, but Socrates shows how little this matters by mentioning the other major poets, Hesiod and Archilochus, the former a master of cataloguing the Greek gods in his &quot;Theogony,&quot; and the latter, a 7th century BC general (&quot;They'll say I was a mercenary,&quot;) who died in battle, who won more fame for the battle about which he wrote a poem in which he dropped his shield and ran away.  Bloom found Ion's devotion to Homer shallow.  &quot;For Ion, Homer is sufficient, for the sole reason that it is for reciting Homer's poetry that golden crowns are awarded.&quot;  (p. 141).<BR>   The longest explanation by Socrates is abouthow poems are created &quot;not by art but by divine dispensation, each is able to do finely only that to which the Muse has impelled him.&quot;  (pp. 129-130).  What is most common in a society which has produced a number of poems that exceeds everyone's fantasies is that a single poet will be commonly known for one work, as Socrates says of &quot;Tynnichus, the Chaldean, who never composed any poem worth remembering other than the poem which everybody sings and which is very nearly the finest of all songs, being simply, as he himself says, `a discovery of the Muses.' &quot;  (p. 130).  Socrates asks about the great dramatic moments, &quot;are you in your right mind?  Or do you become beside yourself, and does your soul think it is at the scene of the deeds of which you speak in your inspiration, either at Ithaca, or Troy, or wherever the epic takes place?&quot;  (p. 130).  Bloom is most aware of the politics of winning approval.  &quot;Ion has no satisfactions which are not dependent on the approval of his spectators.  He needs the cities as they need him.  For political men the accident of where they are born is decisive in limiting their possibilities of fulfillment.&quot;  (p. 161).  Bloom wrote that in 1970, when he still pictured thinking as being the opposite of rock 'n' roll.  Rock's answer might be the song, &quot;Analyse&quot; by The Cranberries.  See both video versions, plus a live version at Vicar Street, in which she calls the song, &quot;Don't Analyse,&quot; on the DVD &quot;Stars.&quot;	2003-02-05

The second paragraph of the Introduction is already into the humor of the situation.  \\"Nietzsche is like laughter from a beautiful mouth or in dancing eyes--soon everyone in the room is swept away by hilarity or hysteria, where the line that separates good health from noxious influence is obliterated.\\"  (p. xiii).  The funny things for me in this book are \\"an old story that comes from Umbria during the High Middle Ages\\" (p. 187), the fantasy set \\"when Nietzsche celebrated his fiftieth birthday in 1894\\" (p. 251), and notes 8 and 9 of Chapter 6, \\"see also my PUREST OF BASTARDS, forthcoming,\\" (p. 262).<br />Chapter 5, \\"Der Maulwurf/ The Mole,\\" has 17 pages of German with English translations.  The little poem:<br />sole<BR>role<BR>of the<BR>mole<BR>    --pp. 118-19<br />rhymes so much better in English (3 perfect rhymes in 5 words) than in the German translation: \\"geworfener/ Entwurf/ des/ Maulwurfs\\" (p. 119).  I don't know much about German, so I'm struck that the German word \\"Entwurf\\" seems remarkably like J.R.R. Tolkien's Entwives, which were missed so much by Treebeard in Chapter 4 of THE TWO TOWERS that he sang an Elvish song to the hobbits, in which an Entwife sang, \\"I'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again:  Together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain!\\"  Chapter 5 of INFECTIOUS NIETZSCHE ends with five pages of a poem, from \\"Dideldum!\\" in German and English, from the book HUMORISTISCHER HAUSSCHATZ by Wilhelm Busch (1963), illustrated by 15 cartoons of man and mole in a garden.  This must be for comic relief, but adding things like this to a book on philosophy might also count as a reality check.<br />Among the serious sections in this book, \\"The Biopositive Effects of Infection\\" on pages 201-03 mentions \\"metaphors in motion.\\"  The next section mentions \\"the contagion of chronic indirect illness.\\"  (p. 205).  There is a bit of psychology in that paragraph.  \\"It may not be a mere contingency that Freud invokes eternal return of the same in the context of re-experiencing trauma.  If war neurosis consists in the effort to discharge the excessive energy of the traumatic event through repetition of the original event in active remembrance, if in repetition compulsion the traumatic event is felt again, is re-sented, it may well be that recurrence is essentially bound up with ressentiment.\\"  (p. 205)  That last word there is in French.  Nietzsche used it so much Walter Kaufmann defined it as \\"a desire for revenge that is born of the sense of being underprivileged.\\"  (THE GAY SCIENCE, section 370, note 126, p. 331).  It wasn't a big surprise to me, when I was drafted, that I might be sent to Nam, or that I dreamed I was in Vietnam, and when I woke up in the morning, I really was in Vietnam.  The joke is that it didn't end there.  Just mentioning Nam makes me sound like I was underprivileged enough to think that I have something to complain about, as if I still haven't gotten used to my life being one thing after another, mostly things I shouldn't talk about, especially the worst.  It was the new Nixon that was really funny for me.  I could never believe that people really wanted a new Nixon, particularly as my commander in chief, if his bright idea was to send me to Cambodia, which was like being re-sented all over again.  Comedy is the only excuse for thinking that I understand how this works, and if you don't get that, you might not like this book.	2003-02-04

It's best lesson is that we really don't know what is going to happen next.  My own attempts to contemplate the kind of secret circus stunts that I have observed have always been extralimital to the presses' goals, but Peter F. Drucker's autobiography, ADVENTURES OF A BYSTANDER, one of the best books I've read, shows how thoroughly someone can describe a fantastic range of people, those who would normally protect their privacy so well that hardly anyone would expect to meet them, even in print.  In MANAGING IN THE NEXT SOCIETY, my big surprise was discovering that a modern literary hero, \\"Franz Kafka also invented the safety helmet.  He was the great man in factory inspection and workmen's compensation.\\"  (p. 33).  Trying to find a place in society, when I know so much by and about Kafka that mental evaluators (I have taken some of their tests) are likely to consider me confused, and my history suggests that I am likely to be grandiose if I try to think at all, this book might not help my future, if the future society is one in which health care has become a top priority, \\"because health care and education together will be 40 percent of the gross national product within twenty years.  Already, they're at least a third.\\"  (p. 29).  Drucker shows that he is still involved in checking business for some sign of a heartbeat.  Thinking that there might be a society some day, but we aren't there yet, sums up the way a lot of people exist.<br />I continue to be shocked by the inability of people to fathom politics.  As someone concerned with financing and management, Drucker is free to report awful experiences whenever a union is involved.  Sometimes a union represents the power of people to demand money:  \\"In the early 1950s, President Truman sent me to Brazil to persuade the government there that with the new technology, we could wipe out illiteracy in five years at no cost.  The Brazilian teachers' union sabotaged it.\\"  (p. 31).  In the U.S., unions had so much political power that it is possible for Drucker to report, \\"Let me say that if we had listened to Mr. Eisenhower, who wanted catastrophic health care for everybody, we would have no health care problems.  What shut him down, as you may not have heard, was the UAW.  In the 1950s, the only benefit the unions could still promise was company-paid health care. . . . So the UAW killed it with help from the American Medical Association.  Still, the AMA wasn't that powerful.  The UAW was.\\"  (p. 35).  If the doctors were willing to take whatever they could get from existing plans instead of trying to figure out how to get any money from the government, you ought to be able to figure out how powerful the government was when Eisenhower (who only wanted to cover \\"everybody who spent more than 10 percent of their taxable income for health expenditures\\" p. 35) was president, a real general, compared to the administration of the fly-by fighter pilot who makes the big promises now.<br />Financially, it seems odd to me that this book is proposing \\"a service waiting to be born:  insurance against the risks of foreign-exchange exposure.\\"  (p. 20).  Anyone who thought that derivatives might accomplish this ought to keep reading until they get a full history of financial services.  \\"But these financial instruments are not designed to provide a service to customers.  They are designed to make the trader's speculations more profitable and at the same time less risky--surely a violation of the basic laws of risk and unlikely to work. . . . as a good many traders have already found out.\\"  (p. 140).  The historical fluctuation is the least part of the beast in the aggregate of currency markets, but Drucker pictures the situation in miniature:  \\"mostly among the world's huge number of middle-size businesses that suddenly find themselves exposed to a chaotic global economy.  No business, except an exceptional very big one, can protect itself against this risk by itself.  Only aggregation, which subjects the risks to probability, could do so. . . . Making catastrophic currency risk insurable might similarly make obsolete most of the foreign-exchange business of existing institutions, let alone their frantic currency trading and speculation in derivatives.\\"  (p. 146).  That was written in 1999.  A general decline has probably not calmed the waters much since then, but the question of whose money would be capable of keeping the business world afloat might still be rising.  There was a time when money itself might be worth something, back in 1724, when Jonathan Swift had to pretend to be M. B. Drapier to complain that coins of brass were not the same as gold and silver.  It has been a long time since anyone could live \\"in a country where the people of all ranks, parties and denominations are convinced to a man, that the utter undoing of themselves and their posterity forever, will be dated from the admission of that execrable coin; that if it once enters, it can no more be confined to a small or moderate quantity, than the plague can be confined to a few families, and that no equivalent can be given by any earthly power, any more than a dead carcass can be recovered to life by a cordial.\\"  (October 13, 1724).<br />Drucker is politically moderate enough to believe \\"it is socially and morally unforgivable when managers reap huge profits for themselves but fire workers.  As societies, we will pay a heavy price for the contempt this generates among middle managers and workers.\\"  (p. 150).  Drucker still thinks of society as including some workers, but this seems less likely the older I get, and he is way up there, if age means anything.	2003-01-31

Hegel is recognized as a philosophical giant who set the context in which thinking was being evaluated in Marx's lifetime.  Tom Rockmore, with the views of a conventional philosophy professor who is an expert in this field, thinks &quot;Marx's critical effort to deal with Hegel, in itself a wonderful example of the conceptual clash of two of the most powerful minds of the nineteenth century, commenced as soon as he began to write.&quot;  (p. xv).  Almost as much attention in the early part of the book is given to Engels, who collaborated with Marx on THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO and other works, who claimed the ability to distinguish &quot;between philosophy and the science of social reality.&quot;  (p. 8).  Marx lived a life that was close to poverty in London, and some consideration of the poor is still part of the picture in this book.  &quot;By poverty I have in mind the fact that a country like India is still unable to assure a reliable source of clean water, that in a distressing number of countries the life expectancy is still less than 60, that famine continues to occur although in fact there is enough food to prevent starvation, and so on.&quot;  (p. 204).  I have corrected a typographical error, &quot;although in in fact,&quot; though someone speaking might actually utter an extra word occasionally.  My favorite correction is in the last sentence of Chapter 6, &quot;Marx the Hegelian,&quot; in which I use the word &quot;continue&quot; twice, and I defy anyone to guess what word appeared in place of `continue' early in this sentence:  &quot;After Hegel and certainly after Marxism, Marx's theories remain and will continue to remain relevant for as long as money is in short supply, and as long as problems intrinsic to the modern industrial world, such as poverty, differences in real opportunity between the rich and poor, and similar economic difficulties, continue to endure.&quot;  (p. 205).<br />Nietzsche shows up late in this book, right after &quot;Kierkegaard, who criticizes Hegel, is a right-wing Hegelian, more interested in God than man, more concerned with returning to God than with understanding man other than through God.  Very much like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche is interested in surpassing such ordinary boundaries as ethical rules.  Unlike his Danish contemporary, Nietzsche is not concerned with people in general, but rather with exceptional human beings, those who are beyond any rules other than those of their own devising.&quot;  (p. 198).  This makes being a philosopher sound pretty simple, like the mindless fans who are spending the sums of money which make people successful in a thoroughly comic society, where value typically means entertainment value, as in the commercials which are constantly being run by the networks.  People with jobs are increasingly irrelevant to economic concerns, as Nietzsche thought the average person would have to reduce their self to a lowly clerk to have a job, or in his case, to retain the esteem of the college professors who dominated philology in the 1870s, when Nietzsche was a college professor.  As Rockmore sees it, after discussing the conception of ideology, &quot;For Friedrich Nietzsche, we are led astray by the tendency of the views of the weak to dominate the discussion.&quot;  (p. 200).<br />There are a number of places in this book where the unpopularity of having a job is obvious, for people who have other things to do.  A theologian, David Friedrich Strauss, who had an amazing ability to come up with distinctions which became prime factors in deciding who was suitable for college professorships, is mentioned by Rockmore early in this book.  The first two paragraphs on page 17 relate &quot;a theological conflict.  David F. Strauss, the author of the influential work, THE LIFE OF JESUS CRITICALLY EXAMINED, published in 1835-6, inferred from his reading of Hegel that the incarnation did not take place in a single person but in the entire human race.&quot;  This tended to make religion primarily a concern of people, rather than doctrine, and for a group in Germany, &quot;as the young Hegelians, consisted in spreading democratic ideas and in awakening the intellectual consciousness of Germany.  Prior to Marx, who was also a young Hegelian, they were, however, unsuccessful in transforming their philosophical ideas into a political movement.&quot;  (pp. 17-18).  This book tries to keep up with what is going on, but as it has no means of considering the non-job economics which currently dominates the political structure of global enterprises, in which wages are the factor that is cut to a minimum in areas that might be expected to have a growing economy, the book is mainly just a summary of political economics as understood a few centuries ago.	2003-01-30
US	49867522	RAXT76AOPQY96	0060194138	650056448	The Modern Mind: An Intellectual History of the 20th Century	Books	4	5	14	N	N	Pretty good for a book that knows more than I do	THE MODERN MIND:  AN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY OF THE 2OTH CENTURY by Peter Watson has Notes and References, an Index of Names, People and Places, and an Index of Ideas Subjects.  This is not quite scholarly enough to have a Bibliography, listing all of the books which would be helpful for understanding this topic.  Some of the most interesting books might be difficult to locate in this volume, for anyone who hardly knows where to look when the game is trying to find where ideas have been situated in the minds of others.  The book trilogy, THE LORD OF THE RING, is not listed in any of the indices, but shows up in the text on the first page of Chapter 42, \\"Deep Order,\\" as an annual reading ritual of Vint Cerf, \\"one of a handful of people who could be called a father of the Internet.\\"  (p. 737).  The author J.R.R. Tolkien is in the Index of Names, People, and Places, but in the text, he is merely J.R. Tolkien in a list of writers who fit the topic, \\"a branch of thought that set the countryside -- nature, peasant life -- against urbanity.\\"  (p. 581).  The reference note does not mention his name at all, though it showed up at his name in the text because of his position, last in the list.  The unfortunate Michael Frayn, author of the successful drama \\"Copenhagen,\\" only shows up in a reference to the conversation between Niels Henrick David Bohr and Werner Heisenberg which was the subject of the drama, and Frayn does not appear in the index.<br />I went into so much detail about the paucity of information about other books, which may be difficult to locate within this volume, because it illustrates a key point associated with Marshall McLuhan, who appears between Guy MacLean and Louis MacNeice in the Index of Names, People and Places (p. 837).  As the last name in a list on page 331, Marshall McLuhan has a note associated with his name which does not mention him, and I wonder if he would appear in book about Walter Benjamin, who is getting credit for \\"anticipating in a general way the ideas of Raymond Williams, Andy Warhol, and Marshall McLuhan.\\"  (p. 331).  Most important for the 20th century, \\"McLuhan's chief interest was the effect of the new `electric' media on man's self-consciousness and behavior, but he also thought this had important consequences for freedom.\\"  (p. 546).  The contrast of tribal consciousness, which modern sociology presumes to locate individuals within cultural pockets of isolated points of view, is in opposition to McLuhan's insight that within a tribal culture, \\"no man knew appreciably more than another.\\"  (p. 546).  The note on this point is thorough: pages in Marshall McLuhan, UNDERSTANDING MEDIA (1968) and ESSENTIAL MCLUHAN (paperback, 1997) with a mention of the Canadian edition of ESSENTIAL MCLUHAN (1995).  With the advent of television, easy videotape and DVD reproduction of movies, much more rock and roll than this book mentions, McLuhan figured our times for \\"retribalised man can learn a far richer and more fulfilling life . . . with a deep emotional awareness of his complete interdependence with all humanity.\\"  (p. 547).  Now, instead of experiencing freedom as an opportunity \\"only to be alienated and disassociated, a rootless outsider bereft of tribal dreams; our new electronic environment compels commitment and participation, and fulfils man's psychic and social needs at a profound level.\\"  (p. 547).  Considering how well this book avoids tough political questions, like how the personal became so political on the issues surrounding the impeachment of President Clinton, it is not surprising that the author is skeptical of some of McLuhan's predictions, and the view of this book is that, \\"In many ways, though he was strikingly original, McLuhan was (so far) wrong.\\"  (p. 547).<br />It is possible to find information about real heroes in this book.  The poem for which Osip Mandelstam was punished for describing Stalin is included in a translation which I had not seen before.  The line, \\"And his large laughing cockroach eyes\\" makes as much sense as a cockroach mustache looming over Stalin's smile, and \\"Tossing out decree after decree like horseshoes\\" sets up the ending of this poem well, but I like the last line that was in DARK SUN:  THE MAKING OF THE HYDROGEN BOMB by Richard Rhodes better.  Ultimately, THE MODERN MIND might seem like an intellectual history which hardly knows its place, but it does have a heart.  You can read hundreds of pages without finding a single song by Bob Dylan, but then, on page 584, \\"Dylan's `It's All Right Ma (I'm only Bleeding),' Reich said, was a far more powerful, and considerably earlier, social critique of police brutality than any number of sociological treatises.\\"  It may take some thinking to figure out who is walking upside down inside handcuffs in that song, but at least Peter Watson shows that someone thinks he figured it out.	2003-01-09

However, upon reflection, wit is a problem that I hardly considered as such, along with the possibility that some people might actually hate this book as much for the things it says as for the general tendency to object to outrageous wit in spite of our appreciation for what it can do.<br />In my own case, I find it disturbing that a vivid young man on the first page of the chapter on Descartes, who once said, \\"I really don't see what someone who lived in the seventeenth century could possibly tell us about the modern world\\" (p. 81) is considered typical of modern ignorance, when that young man might have been born with a brain, studied the main lessons which philosophy has drawn from the MEDITATIONS or DISCOURSE ON METHOD by Descartes, and still considered it outrageous that Descartes was considered the winner of a public confrontation in which he argued, in 1628, \\"that only absolute certainty could serve as a basis for knowledge.\\"  (p. 93).  Most of this book is devoted to consideration of the opposite, \\"what Stove describes (in the second of his two essays on idealism) as `reasoning from a sudden and violent solecism.' \\"  (p. 134).<br />In the chapter \\"Who was David Stove?\\", the contrast between political thought, as it used to be, and our modern world, is considered in the context of, \\"An unprecedented expansion of Communism took place immediately after the Second World War.  For the next twenty-odd years, any possibility of resistance to Communist expansion depended almost entirely upon America: no other country possessed both the requisite military capacity and the willingness to use it.\\"  (p. 255).  The truth was that both sides were caught in a trap of having to promise more than either power structure was willing to deliver to the people who would have to put up with whatever future was left after all the exploitation.  There had been so many promises of peace in Vietnam that by the time the fighting ended, Stove could say, \\"The nation showed that it had become utterly opposed to any further armed resistance to Communism,\\" (p. 255) and Kimball is absolutely certain this is \\"All true.\\"  Time to check the map:  people in many countries managed to change their governments to revolutionary or popular Communist regimes without making a direct attack on the United States of America.  Sometimes sneaky, subversive methods can achieve something that direct confrontation could only portray as an opposing stupidity.  \\"American decadence\\" (p. 256) is identified entirely with a \\"non-coercive philosophy\\" espoused by \\"Robert Nozick's War Wounds\\" (p. 255) according to \\"Stove's review of the late Harvard philosopher's book PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLANATIONS.\\"  (p. 255).  Things have reached such a low point in the history of the world that this attack on the philosophy of a Harvard professor as evidence of \\"a massive sedition at home\\" (as observed by an Australian professor on the bottom of the world) is followed by the observation, \\"I believe that the intellectual capacity of women is on the whole inferior to that of men.\\"  (p. 257).  The connection between these ideas was so obvious to Nietzsche that he considered feminism like democracy and the domestication of cattle, topics which were too modern for philosophical consideration even before people worried about getting mad cow disease because of contaminated animal feed.<br />I would feel more comfortable with a book which does not offend me, in reflecting, \\"Is there anyone in post-Vietnam America who needs to be placated, whom he has not placated?\\" (p. 256) on the lack of militancy of a free populace which is what makes any desire in the rest of the world to attack America truly outrageous.  Fie on this book and its humor.	2003-01-08
US	49867522	R1XEG197GI24XW	1566634792	443719433	Lives of the Mind: The Use and Abuse of Intelligence from Hegel to Wodehouse	Books	4	2	10	N	N	This book is funnier than this review	This book is smart and well educated, but not quite scholarly.  There are very few notes, no bibliography, but some books are listed under their author's names in the index.  Many of the chapters are similar to a journalist's review of biographies published in the last 20 years.  THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCHOPENHAUER by Bryan Magee was published in 1983.  In the case of Descartes, Stephen Gaukroger is mentioned as the author of a biography published by Oxford University Press in 1995, but the title is not mentioned in the text (titles are becoming too long to be mentioned in any book which is this entertaining) and does not appear in the index.  Kimball praises a biographer's apt description of the philosophical process.  &quot;Gaukroger is right that `the MEDITATIONS read like an account of a spiritual journey in which the truth is only to be discovered by a purging, followed by a kind of rebirth.' &quot;  (p. 86).  Kimball is also interested in the &quot;fondness for psychoanalytic interpretations&quot; (p. 85) and other influences on &quot;Gaukroger, who teaches at the University of Sydney, proposes to extract the `real' Descartes from the integument spun by his multifarious interpreters.  Whether what we actually get is an unencumbered Descartes, or only one bedecked with Gaukroger's preoccupations, is an open question.&quot;  (p. 85).<br />This book, LIVES OF THE MIND: THE USE AND ABUSE OF INTELLIGENCE FROM HEGEL TO WODEHOUSE, is divided into three parts.  Each of the chapter titles in Part Two mentions a major thinker, except you might not have heard of the one at the end, &quot;Who is David Stove?&quot;  I recently read a philosophical biography of Thomas Kuhn by Steve Fuller, so the question did not surprise me as much, though Fuller possibly mentioned everyone who has ever written a book about Karl Popper.  If Fuller mentioned a name and year in his book, there was usually something in his Bibliography to substantiate whatever thoughts were being attributed to thementioned person, but LIVES OF THE MIND is not quite that scholarly.  David Stove is some kind of hero to people who crave logical opposition to the typical scholarly drivel, but the logic is difficult for most people.  This book praises mainly whatever strikes Kimball as being brilliant.<br />What is ordinary in this book is the use of the word, Absolute.  The index begins with an entry for Acton, John, Lord, 277, so each occurrence of the word, Absolute, was mostly unexpected for me, except in the chapter on Hegel, who is mentioned in the subtitle.  The first chapter, on Raymond Aron, includes the statement by Aron, &quot;The last word is never said and one must not judge one's adversaries as if one's own cause were identified with absolute truth.&quot;  (p. 8).  It is easy to ridicule the major French thinkers of the 20th century when one is able to find one who spent his life doing it because of &quot;what was and must remain the heart and soul of the unending human adventures:  freedom of enquiry; freedom of controversy, freedom of criticism, and the vote.&quot;  (p. 10).  In the real world, &quot;The problem is that the poetry of the absolute is an inhuman poetry.  As Aron dryly observed, in real life ideal emancipation turns out to be `indistinguishable from the omnipotence of the State.' &quot;  (pp. 10-11).<br />The absolute was important in an argument for Descartes.  &quot;In 1628, at a meeting on Aristotelian philosophy at the residence of the papal nuncio, Descartes had a famous public confrontation with a certain doctor Chandoux, a chemist/alchemist who argued against the dominance of scholastic philosophy and in favor of a science based on merely probable knowledge.  His training in rhetoric standing him in good stead, Descartes gave a dazzling public refutation, arguing that only absolute certainty could serve as a basis for knowledge.  (It is a nice detail that Chandoux was later executed for counterfeiting.)&quot;  (p. 93).<br />In the chapter, &quot;Schiller's `Education',&quot; Kimball seeks a link to religion.  &quot;Especially in times when traditional religious commitments are in retreat, many people look to art for spiritual dividends previously sought elsewhere.  This burdens art, and intellectual talk about art, with intoxicating expectations.  The expectations are consistently disappointed, but the intoxication remains.  The result is the hothouse rhetoric of romanticism, full of infinite longings, sublime impatience, impetuous raids on an ever-retreating, capital-A Absolute.&quot;  (pp. 103-04).<br />The chapter called &quot;The Difficulty With Hegel&quot; mentions the book, HEGEL:  A BIOGRAPHY by Terry Pinkard on pages 120-27, and Absolute Knowledge on page 121.  &quot;Artists have an intuitive grasp of the Absolute, Hegel thought;&quot;  (p. 131).  &quot;What is true, I think, is that in Hegel we see a theological student who became disenchanted with theology but could not see his way clear to dispensing with the aura of profundity that theology offered.  The result was the attenuated theology of Hegelian idealism, in which the Absolute stands for God.&quot;  (p. 124).  Hegel could easily criticize this in others.  &quot;He castigates his immediate precursors--Kant, Fichte, Schelling--for getting everything wrong (Schelling's idea of the Absolute, Hegel memorably said, was `cognition naively reduced to vacuity,' a `night in which all cows are black').&quot;  (p. 133).<br />The chapter &quot;Who Was David Stove?&quot; ties perfectionism to what his critique calls irrationalism.  &quot;They all acknowledge that absolute certainty is impossible; but they assume that only absolute certainty will do as a warrant for rational belief.&quot;  (p. 268).  That was certainly what Descartes argued in 1628, and it worked so well for him, some philosophers are still at it.	2003-01-07
US	49867522	R248S8MQCZJT0M	0300023588	370646695	Kant's Life and Thought	Books	4	2	34	N	N	Approaching comprehension with great praise	It has been so long since the original German version of this biography of Kant was written by Ernst Cassirer in 1916 (and first published in 1918, due to \\"the delay inflicted by the war on the progress of the edition of the complete works,\\" (p. 2) according to the Foreword by Ernst Cassirer dated August 14, 1918) that it might be considered quite proper that the recent biography of Kant by Manfred Kuehn deserves to be much more modern in its point of view.  My review of Kuehn's book emphasized how modern Kant ought to be considered for someone who lived in his times.  Kuehn also put a major emphasis on Kant's desire for perpetual peace, a topic which might have been considered questionable for anyone writing in German at the time when Cassirer was writing this book for use as a supplement to the study of Kant's complete works.<br />I should admit that I have not attempted the study of Kant's work in the manner for which this book is meant to be a guide.  I might even be considered too political to be offered a position on such a faculty, so I have no expectation of ever becoming a professional philosopher, and furthermore, I might even be so comical that I would dare to consider Cassirer and Kant as representative of philosophers in the way that Merry and Pippin were typical of hobbits in the movie cycle, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  The set of 4 DVD disks covering the first movie, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" allows easy access to specific points in the movie, and scene 44, \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship,\\" on the second disk, shows the two hobbits (knowing that Frodo Baggins was the only important target) acting as decoys, crying, \\"Hey!  Hey, you!  Over here!\\"  Logically, this follows scene 40, \\"The Fighting Uruk-hai,\\" in which Saruman declares his creation, the Uruk-hai, a perfect creature for war, much as Prussia is described as a highly disciplined place during Kant's life in this book.  Philosophically, Kant's writings, which reflect his use of thought processes, can be selected and their relevance to \\"The whole moral voice of the Enlightenment, as it lived in the purest and greatest spirits,\\" (p. 83) are here demonstrated as logically as Pippin and Merry's exclamations, \\"It's working!\\"  \\"I know it's working!  Run!\\" could be considered a histrionic reflection of the admiration for tactics similar to the praise for Kant's philosophy which this book exhibits.<br />This book also exhibits an eagerness to bring God into every discussion in a manner which has become much less popular as the experience of the godly has been tied detrimentally to the likes of Osama bin Laden in the last hundred years or so.  My interest in the early part of the book was primarily in comparing the competing Cosmologies of that time.  Kant's early work, UNIVERSAL NATURAL HISTORY AND THEORY OF THE HEAVENS (March 14, 1755), which was dedicated just three months before Kant became a doctor of philosophy on the strength of his treatise, DE IGNE (ON FIRE), was not well known in his time because \\"The publisher had gone bankrupt while the work was in press; his entire warehouse was sealed up, and therefore this book never came onto the market.\\"  (p. 40).  In attempting to think beyond the laws of motion which had been established by Newton for a Kantian cosmogony which Kant derives from such laws, \\"The planetary world in which the sun, acting with its powerful attraction from the center of all the orbits,\\" (p. 47) is considered the cause of the planetary system, and particularly accounting for \\"the `unanimity of the direction and positions of the planetary orbits'.\\" (p. 49)  Kant also uses this explanation \\"in order to think of it as in proportion to the power of the Infinite Being, it must have no limits at all.\\"  (p. 47).  Newton could have come to the same conclusion about the origins of planetary motion \\"if instead of seeking the physical bases of the system of astronomical phenomena exclusively in its present state he had turned his gaze backwards to the past of the system, if he had pushed forward from the consideration of the systematic state of the universe to its systematic becoming.\\"  (p. 49).<br />The big jolt in Kant's cosmology was caused by his attempt to comprehend a heavenly system of a different kind, described in  Part 3 of the second chapter of this book. \\"The Critique of Dogmatic Metaphysics:  DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER,\\" (pp. 77-92) on Kant becoming \\"aware of the marvelous tales surrounding the `visionary' Swedenborg, which led him to immerse himself deeper into Swedenborg's work, the ARCANA COELESTIA.  We use this account here not to repeat it, but are content to make reference to it.  Who will seriously believe that because he had bought the eight quarto volumes of Swedenborg's works, at a considerable outlay of trouble and expense, Kant would have decided to perform a literary analysis on the book?\\"  (p. 79).  Kant's book on Swedenborg \\"appeared anonymously\\" (p. 78) and he was determined that \\"I shall never become a fickle or fraudulent person, after having devoted the largest part of my life to studying how to despise those things that tend to corrupt one's honesty.\\"  [Kant to Mendelssohn, April 6, 1766] (p. 79).  Swedenborg's ARCANA COELESTIA might still be considered a work in which the dreams of a religious writer were collected with more enthusiasm than anyone prior to Freud had shown for understanding his dreams, and Kant's problem stems in large part from Swedenborg's understanding of his dreams being considered an explanation of heavenly forces, or more often, of the conflicts between heavenly and hellish spirits.  Cassirer is willing to venture \\"that the whole idea of the spiritual is due to habit and prejudice, rather than to exact scientific analysis.\\"  (p. 81).  Lacking such habits, modern people can read this book for a philosophical guide to how Kant's thought went on from that point, or spend their time watching hobbits, with the 4 DVD disks that show how the \\"Lord of the Rings\\"movies were made, or make countless other choices.  People who believe this book might spend a lot of time studying Kant, as the author certainly did.	2002-12-31

I was most interested in who had the first hydrogen bomb (the first real plan, the ideal materials, a way to make it, and a test device) and I didn't mind reading about \\"some radioactive indicator which is formed with the participation of fast deuterons\\" (p. 304) to find out.  Sorting out the physics, which can be revealed to those who care to know, with a comparison of alternate paths to the same result, reveals something far more substantial than the usual plot, based on the politics of world domination, the main concern of Stalin and the author of this book.  Stalin gets some sympathy for facing a stark post-war reality, based on his comparison of what World War II did to Russia and Germany, compared to the damage which the few atomic bombs which existed in his lifetime could produce, and it might be said that he acted accordingly in attempting to maintain countervailing threats whenever he was pressured.  Any notion of absolute justice, or even feasible military advantage, seems to be as elusive for the superpowers (and one still exists today) as for the petty despots and warlords that often become characters in this book about how such weapons came to be.  I didn't mind the revelations about certain events:  a war in Korea at a critical point in this book even makes the question of when Mao ordered the Chinese divisions into Korea an interesting question to be considered.  In most of these books, I like the events which influenced Sakharov most, the best.  The description of the shock wave from the November 1955 test on pages 316-7 includes, \\"All of this triggers an irrational yet very strong emotional impact.\\"	2002-03-17

In the recent hardcover edition which I have, the dates of printing of Thorstein Veblen's book IMPERIAL GERMANY AND THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION are listed as 1915, 1939, and 1964.  In the first two years listed, America was safely sitting on the sidelines, observing the kind of warlike behavior attributed to the dynastic state in this book in Europe, much as Elizabethan England enjoyed several centuries of isolation from the wars which were devastating Europe in the years in which its economic activities became industrial, though socially, as Veblen observed, \\"Conventions that are in some degree effete continue to cumber the ground.\\"  (p. 30).  By 1964, America was playing such a large role in the world that Germany might have been the kind of problem that America, from a unique position of political and military superiority, ought to have been able to resolve, and possibly did by acting as if the major problems in the world were somewhere else.<br />Chapter I, Introductory -- Races and Peoples, compares the mixture of races which populated England and Germany to be quite similar, if not exactly the same.  A note on page 23, in Chapter 2, The Old Order, compares such mixing with what occurred in Japan, \\"and possibly also the Aegean peoples of antiquity.\\"  \\"By a curious coincidence, the period of Japanese prehistory and history seems to cover loosely the same general interval of time as that of the Baltic peoples; and as with the latter, so in the case of the Japanese, the cultural life-history of the people is a history of facile and ubiquitous borrowing done in the most workmanlike manner and executed with the most serviceable effect.\\"<br />In the chapter on The Dynastic State, Veblen notes that printing was a handicraft which was well practiced in Germany, and included \\"the circulation of obnoxious literature that purveys excessively modern ideas\\" (note on p. 76), but that it appeared to be best \\"to engender that habit of reading as to make the assimilation of the new industrial order an easy matter, resulting in a marked advance in efficiency and physical comfort, and then to temper coercion with a well-conceived cajolery.\\" (note, p. 76).<br />One of the pleasures of reading Veblen is encountering philosophical ideas in an utterly different context, as on page 109:<br />. . . While the corresponding English movement, in so far as touches the point here in question, has tended strongly to an atheistic and unmoral scheme of opaque and impersonal matter of fact.  This work of the human spirit as it has come into play under the German habituation is spoken of as \\"nobler,\\" \\"profounder,\\"--a point not to be disputed, since such discrimination is invidious and is an affair of taste and perspective.<br />The final paragraph of the chapter on The Case of England is devoted to the \\"direct waste of time and substance involved in this ubiquitous addiction to sports.\\"  (p. 148).  I enjoy Veblen's offhandedly remarkable description of how \\"persons with a predilection for artistic and intellectual dissipations may be moved to deprecate addiction to dissipations of this crude and brutalizing nature,\\" (p. 148) but this book deserves far more serious readers than I am.	2002-03-12

My appreciation of this book is primarily based on my desire to possess a few of the sculptures which it discusses.  There have been philosophical attempts to equate beauty and truth, but the people responsible for such discussions seem to be information looters and shooters compared to the ability of Bernini to make a dynamic representation of father time ripping the covers off of truth.  There is just a sketch to show what Bernini had in mind regarding father time, but the sculpture for truth, done when Bernini was young and kept, so there is no possibility that I will ever have it, is the subject of this comment on page 86:<br />In his later years the sculptor enjoyed quoting a quip bandied about Rome that &quot;Truth was to be found only in Bernini's house.&quot;	2002-03-10

The German tradition in philosophy has been so notoriously wrong about the nature of women so often that it is only fair that I, who usually appears as nobody in the world of philosophy as often as I am wrongly genedered in any attempt to belong to the world of women, have to read this book occasionally to remind myself how unfair this whole question must be in any context.  That philosophy, as a love of wisdom, might be compared to a love of women, as the kind of passion that Mozart might attempt to display in operatic splendor in \\"Don Giovanni\\" (I think this is the most reasonable opera that I have ever heard) faces grave danger in a book in which the man who has embraced most totally the greatness of philosophy (who but Heidegger might want this distinction?), is slammed for having an unreasonable love life.  For all I know, this might have been the story of a philosopher who might as well have thought that all was fair in love and war, but it is really the story of the woman.  The perfection in this book, for me, was the idea that Heidegger might have been offended when Arendt triumphantly returned to Germany as the author of a book on totalitarianism in which the style of the Nazi regime, which Heidegger supported in certain official capacities, was treated like communism under Stalin, the kind of enemy of freedom that modern people ought to be able to understand in a negative light much better than anything positive that I could say at this point.  I doubt if I would have had much interest in Hannah Arendt, if not for this book.  It made me wish that I could be that smart.	2002-03-08

The ultimate justification for the topics covered in this book might be that it recognizes certain disagreements about how law ought to be applied, that certain questions might be raised with any authority that seeks to apply laws in a manner which, according to Lon Fuller, seems to violate \\"practical wisdom applied to problems that may broadly be called those of social architecture.  St. Thomas Aquinas stands for many as a kind of symbol of all that is dogmatic and theological in the tradition of natural law.  Yet as one writer has recently pointed out, Aquinas in some measure recognized and dealt with all eight of the principles of legality discussed in my second chapter.\\"  (pp. 241-2).  If anything, trying to impose morality on an enterprise as quixotic as the law is more likely to meet with indifference today than ever, and already in Chapter IV of this book, Fuller admitted that scholars could mean him when discussing \\"Law and Morals\\" and complaining:  \\"Again, if this is what the necessary connexion of law and morality means, we may accept it.  It is unfortunately compatible with very great iniquity.\\"  (p. 154).  Just thinking about very great iniquity reminds me of what most people think prosecutors are for, and in the interest of harmony in the marketplace, I will make no further comments on this book.  If only the law could always be so lucky.	2002-01-28

This story from ancient Greece, a prime point in the history of philosophy, is told with a very thorough knowledge of journalistic points of view, expressing the kind of optimism about possible results that overlooks how readily legal proceedings can operate like secret military tribunals in coming up with the result desired most by whatever power can manipulate the proceedings most easily to favor itself.  I.F. Stone tells this story so well, people who base their understanding of our political world on what they might learn from this book could expect to see more on such matters, especially if they are expecting the upcoming proceedings against the current enemies of democracy to fill their morning newspapers with the issues encountered in this book, if only there were newspapers which dared to raise any issues.  Socrates is the issue-oriented person in THE TRIAL OF SOCRATES, and Stone is wise enough to notice that getting into an argument is not the same as winning the case in a proceeding of this nature.<br />Philosophically, democracy has a tendency to adopt itself as an ideology, claimed by whatever faction is most adept at Schmittian politics, the nature of which is explained in great detail in THE CONCEPT OF THE POLITICAL by Carl Schmitt {the comments by Leo Strauss contained in the currently available translation into English includes the observation, &quot;It is nonetheless true that the polemic against liberalism very often seems to be Schmitt's last word, that he very often gets entangled in the polemic against liberalism, and that he thus gets diverted from his real intention and is detained on the level staked out by liberalism.  This entanglement is no accidental failure but the necessary result . . .&quot; (Tracy B. Strong edition, p. 106)} and the very existence of Socrates as a person who is intentionally unprofessional, willingly associated with people who are as guilty as hell of malingering when called upon to perform the duties and civic obligations of people who think up charges to be brought as the best way of overcoming whoever might wonder who performed their work in a more religious manner, officials clouded in secrecy, or people who try to talk about what is going on.

If intellectuals in modern society have lost the high standing that they had when intellectuals could be expected to support basic norms, it might be due to their ability to identify with the level of mental acivity evident in this book more readily than with the norms of a society in which people desparately need to believe that they are being understood.  First, I would like to recommend this book to people who would like to do some original thinking in the area of religion.  In my own religious history, it was surprising how well I could identify with the Edgar Allan Poe-ness of my nature, whenever ultimate problems needed to be faced.  I have come to realize that, for the intellectuals of the world, the works of Edgar Allan Poe are like a collection of worn out American horse feathers compared to the depth which can be imagined by those who read the works of Kafka.  I'll vouch for that, too.	2002-01-19

There have been times in my life when I doubted that the ability to convince people that they are crazy was ultimately of any benefit.  A few ancient Greeks thought mania could be great, and many times I have felt that a person really shouldn't have to be crazy, but it takes a wacky guy to say anything.  Freud would have a hard time justifying his existence as a doctor if doctors didn't have a long history of convincing people that they were crazy.  Religious fanatics have been able to practice their frenzies when it could be done as a form of harmless exhibitionism, but the idea that human beings exist primarily as components of a society makes the ability to decide which element is ultimately the most catastrophic a serious question, and how seriously Freud treats this stuff is indicated by how Heine's great joke on a topic which Freud considers a forbidden form of humor makes it into a footnote, anyway.  Maybe Heine was dead by the time Freud wrote this book, so Freud thought it wouldn't really hurt if we all had a laugh at Heine's expense, but some people might not think it was as funny if Freud had been talking about Osama bin Laden.  Fortunately, Freud is dead, so a little fun at his expense shouldn't be too deadly, but this book doesn't exactly establish where this will all end.  Best wishes.	2002-01-15

This is one of the slimmest books that I bought in 2001, bargain priced, and I was sure it could tell me a lot about myself as well as about how Einstein thought.  I spent 1964 through 1967 studying the kind of mechanics which Einstein is thought to have expanded into another dimension by making time an axis which allows consideration of systems moving at different speeds. E=mc-squared was a formula that I knew from high school.  When I was learning calculus at the University of Michigan in the fall of 1965, it seemed to be the perfect mathematics for expressing what happens to objects in motion.  In algebra, the big problem for those of us with a one track mind, capable of being surprised by solutions which didn't actually fit the problem, was solving equations in ways which did not involve a solution that required dividing both sides of an equation by zero.  In calculus, major trends were often considered much more important than minor trends when everything was divided by quantities that were so small, they were like numbers approaching zero, and borderline concepts were subject to the kind of ambivalence that makes borderline psychological experiences such a booming field in the area of personality disorders, but the key thing about this book is the attempt to keep an eye on what can be learned from science.  I thought that I was picking up what still made sense to me in the U of M introduction to Physics until there was a question on the final exam which asked for a mathematical manipulation of equations to produce the result E = mc-squared.  I knew some equations, and wrote a few things down, but I didn't come up with that answer.  I think I even looked in the textbook after the test, to see if I had forgotten something which was on one page, but I couldn't find that page.  This book has what I should have known then.<br />The final section of the book, 7.  AN ELEMENTARY DERIVATION OF THE EQUIVALENCE OF MASS AND ENERGY, from pages 70 to 73, claims to use the law of conservation of momentum, an expression for the pressure of radiation, and two coordinate systems, one of which is moving rapidly along the direction of the axis of a system which is fixed relative to a body that has equal radiation hitting it from both sides.  I doubt if the professor for the Physics class expected me to think of this method of finding that E = mc-squared, and I'm still not sure that I believe this approach proves it.  In the still system, the momentums of equal and opposite radiation complexes cancel each other completely, so the amount of energy which might be involved doesn't matter.  For the system which is moving, the radiation is assumed to be hitting the body from some angle related to that speed, and the change of momentum added by the component along the axis of motion does not change the speed, so the additional momentum is considered an addition to the mass of the body.  The mathematical solution depends on solving equations for the difference in the mass observed for using two different systems, one of which is observing zero momentum, and the other thinking, &quot;We anticipate here the possibility that the mass increased with the absorption of the energy E (this is necessary so that the final result of our consideration be consistent).&quot;  I believe Albert Einstein wrote this book, but I still wonder what it is telling us.aw of conservation of momentum, an expression for the pressure of radiation, and two coordinate systems, one of which is moving rapidly along the direction of the axis of a system which is fixed relative to a body that has equal radiation hitting it from both sides.

As always, Nietzsche demonstrates an incredible grasp of theology, and it is merely our own stupidity that someone who is so much smarter than his teachers in this way is in so much trouble in the field of public opinion, which demands a much more comfortable stupidity than any reader of this book is likely to sympathize with.  In the midst of this book, the judgment which Nietzsche pursues about very early Greek thinkers is &quot;These religious insights originated from a need to eliminate anthropomorphism, but they still show the primordial Hellenic sensitivity toward the gods.&quot;  (p. 78)  The fragment of Xenophanes, given in Greek in footnote 15 on that page, which preceded his observation, was:  &quot;Always he remains in the same place, not moving at all; Nor is it fitting for him to go to different places at different times.&quot;  As Nietzsche thought Plato and Aristotle understood this, &quot;the entire dichotomy between spirit and matter, deity and world, is absent here.  He resolves the identification of God and man in order to equate God and nature.&quot;  (pp. 78-79).  In humor, a high spot is a poem by Planudes about Seven Wise Men, with a line, &quot;But Bias of Priene declared, The majority are the worse.&quot;  (p. 22).  Nietzsche makes the effort to sort them all out.  On Anaximander, he said, &quot;Thus he made two great advances over Thales, to wit, a principle of water's warmth and coldness and a principle of the Unlimited, the final unity, the matrix of continuous arising.&quot;  (p. 33).

Try as I might, I haven't come up with the blend of radical individualism thwarted by universal awareness which would make this kind of book an intellectual treat for most people.  I have read the poems by William Blake (just a few thousand lines, really) that are in this book before, and I even compared the abridged copy of his poems which I've had for years with a complete text from the library to discover what I could about the process of selection.  Most of this is still a big mystery to a lot of people, and buying this book was my first attempt to get the whole picture of what a lot of professors might think about a single work, which is printed on plates numbered 1, then 1 to 8, 8*, 9 to 32, 32*, 33 to 46, then a Preface, copy B, plate 2, and even a plate f, followed by variations of the pictures which were on plate 13 and other Supplementary Illustrations.  I had some trouble making out words on the colored plates, so the most educational part of the book for me is the printed text with notes from pages 111 to 217.<br />Milton is a great figure in English literature, and the great poems which place Satan and God in a struggle that makes Adam and Eve seem like minor characters are the intellectual context for Blake's effort to write a poem using Milton to write about things that minor characters wouldn't even want to talk about.  Things don't really start happening for me until plate 12, &quot;According to the inspiration of the Poetic Genius/Who is the eternal all-protecting Divine Humanity&quot; that Milton actually rose up and said, &quot;I go to Eternal Death!&quot;  Don't expect to meet anyone saying such things on our streets.  This attempt to be instructive in the art of self-annihilation produces one of the great intellectual puzzles of eternal questions, which attempt not to apply to a particular place and time.  My appreciation of John Milton and William Blake is more concerned with their ideas than with artistic techniques.  The importance of Blakewas suggested, more than it was demonstrated, by Theodore Roszak in THE MAKING OF A COUNTER CULTURE, Chapter VIII, &quot;Eyes of Flesh, Eyes of Fire,&quot; which observes that a &quot;perfectly sensible interpretation . . . would tell us, for example, that the poet Blake, under the influence of Swedenborgian mysticism, developed a style based on esoteric visionary correspondences . . . Etc.  Etc.  Footnote.&quot;  (Roszak, p. 239).  What really impressed me was the intellectual context established in the Bibliographical Notes, at the end of THE MAKING OF A COUNTER CULTURE, which states, &quot;Anything Blake ever wrote seems supremely relevant to the search for alternative realities.&quot;  (p. 302).  The radical element of that thought needs to be understood in a way that affirms the religious significance of what Blake was trying to accomplish, and other scholars might overlook how this search in Blake's work might oppose their own assumptions about our cultural inheritance.  Harold Bloom, in BLAKE'S APOCALYPSE, (1963, shortly before the radical part of the sixties) said &quot;The dark Satanic Mills have nothing to do with industrialism, but&quot; poetically pick the most common example for why those who are bored might want to complain of &quot;The same dull round, even of a universe, would soon become a mill with complicated wheels.&quot;  (Bloom, p. 305).  There are a lot of names to explain, as Bloom does in his book, and the scholars employed by Tate Gallery Publications for the production of this book display an extraordinary amount of work on this project for that purpose, and the intellectual puzzles are what remains mysterious even after learning what knowledge is available.<br />At the heart of the poem, &quot;Milton,&quot; is the question of what such a character might mean to William Blake, and how, long after Milton's death, he might be of some use.  A lot of works have been written to give an author the opportunity to say something that he wouldn't have otherwise had a chance to say, and this book seems to be one of the unique cases of a work which tries to say something that no one else is saying.  Instead of treating Milton like anyone who had been dead for more than a hundred years, the treatment of Milton's thought also supposes that it exists through an &quot;Emanation, Sixfold presumably because he had three wives and three daughters.&quot;  (Bloom, p. 308).  Bloom thinks this book is a result of &quot;a complex relation of responsibility to what he has made, though his creation is in torment because scattered through the creation.&quot;  (p. 308).  After John Milton had become blind, his wives and daughters represented a tremendous portion of his remaining contact with the world.<br />Walter Kaufmann, in LIFE AT THE LIMITS, considered a sonnet by the blind Milton about a dream in which one of his wives, who had died, was seen by him &quot;Brought back to me like Alcestis from the grave.&quot;  The reality expressed in the final line of that poem, &quot;I wak'd, she fled, and day brought back my night,&quot; seemed to Kaufmann to be &quot;the most powerful last line of any English short poem.&quot;  (LIFE AT THE LIMITS, p. 75).  Blake approached this situation, in which picturing another person might be considered the strongest link with any reality, with what modern readers might consider an unctiously religious picture on plate 15, with the caption (explained on p. 139 with, &quot;The giving up of selfhood to achieve a more inclusive sense of self is essential for the artist to create&quot; which isn't so scary if it is only applied to artists and monks):  &quot;To annihilate the Self-[there is a foot here in the picture]-hood of Deceit &amp; False Forgiveness.&quot;  Then plate 16 starts with &quot;In those three females whom his Wives, &amp; those three whom his Daughters/Had represented and containd.  that they might be resume'd / By giving up of Selfhood:&quot;  This poetic division of a single poetinto six male-female relationships is the most surprising thing in the poem, for me.  Trying to apply it to religion states a much more radical understanding of what religion has to offer than most people expect if they merely go to church, which seems to be one of Roszak's points about how our culture accepts religion by making it strictly mainstream, totally &quot;God Bless America&quot; as the most popular current phrase goes.  Much of the scholarship on the creation of Blake's large works notes how uncommercial it was in Blake's day, as &quot;Hayley discouraged him from anything other than `the meer drudgery of business' (p. 14)&quot; and this book tries to make that picture perfectly clear.<br />In one of the few small works at the end of this book, Blake complained:<br />The Classics, it is the Classics! / &amp; not Goths nor Monks, that / Desolate Europe with Wars.  (p. 264)<br />I feel the same way, complaining about some books, but Blake assumed a society in which people were actually being taught things like a Platonic belief in forms, and the Classics were a large element of what seemed bad to him.  He might have felt differently if he ever had a chance to observe our formless void, where any claim to wisdom is highly suspect.  We can only look the other way.	2001-12-02

Schmittian political theory treats killing as the unthinkable monstrosity which it usually is, but allows the state to have a monopoly on declarations of war, which is about the only thing that might be considered important by those who only permit it when they have an enemy.  The things in this book apply so well to the Greeks who were camped outside Troy all those years, wondering why they couldn't win when they were so obviously right, that the kind of politics in this book might be considered classic.  Schmitt was in a little trouble once, after World War II, when people wondered if he should be treated like a war criminal for openly thinking about the logic of this kind of thing as a German, who published this as Der Begriff des Politischen in 1932.  There is a possibility that some of the people who won World War II didn't want politicians to think this way:  &quot;The political is the most intense and extreme antagonism, and every concrete antagonism becomes that much more political the closer it approaches the most extreme point, that of the friend-enemy grouping.&quot;  (p. 29).  Honestly, the things people think can get them in a lot of trouble, which is probably why you never see much thinking on television.	2001-11-26

This book, Life at the Limits, a philosophical picture book by someone who appreciates how much our visual images determine which views might help maintain our society as a superpower, assumes modernity as it builds to a confrontation with all that has been taught, but this book almost fails to approach the comic willingness of those who have yielded to the temptation to be constantly entertaining, as that need is understood by those who have overcome the limits usually placed on philosophy, which in attempting to bolster the superpower's views, must be reluctant to admit that it was written in and about the kingdom of the cruel.  There is no index in this book, which is taken as a sure sign to highly suspect readers, such as myself, that security would be breached if people  were able to locate the identities assumed by the philosopher in this effort.  It is also unlikely that anything suggested by this book will be considered in alphabetical order.  There is a list of 24 words beginning with the letter d on page 66, but even those words aren't in alphabetical order, but, comically enough, a lot of them are described as dismal.  Already, there should be something funny, and what comes to my mind as being one of my favorite comic bits on the same topic is a cockroach interviewing a mummy, the episode \\"archy interviews a pharaoh\\" at page 33 of \\"archy and mehitabel\\" by don marquis.  The first important d word there is in the sentence, \\"in my tender prime I was too dignified to have anything as vulgar as ambition.\\"  (marquis, p. 33).  Death is one of the d words in the Kaufmann list, and at times he seems to approach the view of the pharaoh who thought, \\"if I had my life to live over again I would give dignity the regal razz and hire myself out to work in a brewery.\\"  (marquis, p. 35).  As archy says, \\"my sympathies are with your royal dryness,\\" (p. 36) who had to admit, \\"I am as dry as the heart of a sand storm at high noon in hell.\\"  (p. 36).  archy is not to be outdone, once religion has been brought into the discussion, and refers to the mummy as \\"divine drouth\\" and \\"my reverend juiceless ness\\" as well as \\"the royal desiccation\\" (p. 37) but the d words really pile up when a great cough of despair turned the unfortunate residuum \\"to dust and debris right in my face/it being the only time/I ever actually saw anybody/put the cough/into sarcophagus.\\"  (pp. 37-9).  I can't be sure that this deformity of d word topics is what Kaufmann had in mind when he mentioned someone being \\"struck by more than one item from list A. . . . There is work here even for those who like to use computers.\\"  (p. 67).  Depth was a word in the B list, in which comedy might be included in the derangement, drugs, debauchery, and, especially in the kingdom of the cruel, with \\"degradation of others.\\"  (p. 66).  There is reason to believe that psychotic multiplicity might be a factor in achieving depth in such an effort; as Kaufmann says, \\"by attaining sufficient depth one approaches the limits.\\"  (p. 67).<br />On page 127, the entry for Nietzsche in the Bibliography says, \\"See page 2 above.\\"  Most people think of Nietzsche as all of the ideas which they have previously had about him and his philosophy, and Kaufmann, famous for his Nietzsche translations, is fortunate to be able to admit it so openly.  Page 2 is a list, \\"Books by Walter Kaufmann,\\" and due to its relatively recent appearance, and although it remains my favorite book, THE GAY SCIENCE is at the bottom of the list.  Since there are a large number of photographs at the beginning, the Prologue of this book is on page 65.  There isn't enough space in a review to go over &quot;Dover Beach&quot; on page 77, but I know, for sure, that the line &quot;vast edges Near&quot; should end with &quot;drear&quot;.	2001-11-25

There may be some problem, like am I being retro? with the way that I think about the poems in this book, because I tried to read the whole book more than twenty years ago, and was so impressed that when an Etcetera collection of additional poems came out in 1983, I bought that too.  I'm not sure I know anyone now who would even consider reading a book this big if it was just poems.  The big revelation in the 1913-1962 collection, as far as I was concerned, was the poem &quot;the boys i mean are not refined,&quot; which was first published in a limited edition of nine copies in 1935, according to the first paragraph of the inside flap of the First American edition 1972 of Complete Poems 1913-1962, which I still have.  That poem, in particular, taught me a lot about culture, and how someone (famous) who knew what culture was could know what could be said, while others might just &quot;speak whatever's on their mind.&quot;  This might be close to what the verses in Proverbs that try to describe the difference between a wise man and a fool are trying to say, and it was great to find that someone who might be considered almost as modern as myself could be sensitive to this kind of thing, almost like hearing John Prine wondering if it would be possible for him to still blush in some song he wrote.<br />Even I don't read much of this book at any one time, anymore, but I appreciate how well it stores its pleasures.  One of the curiosities of poetry is that it can be incredibly difficult to find a poem unless the first line is the one that pops into the appropriate recall mechanism, whenever a poem is thought of, and this book has been around a long time because, even when I don't know if I will be able to find what I am looking for, it is interesting to look through it trying to find the last line of a great poem that was greater at the end than at the beginning.  My favorite poem in this book starts out with &quot;jake hates/all the girls&quot; but the great thing is an unexpected rhyme scheme, which jumps around from bold, meek, sleek, cold in the first verse to lean, mean, clean, green in the last.  Actually, this poem might be considered utterly devastating if there was anything personal about it, but thoughts about all the girls have been on the conscience of philosophy about as long as books have been maintained for the future, and it does my heart good to see a poet try to join in the mess surrounding this topic.  What I mean is, I think this poem is good in a way that centuries of being modern might try to deny, but it is here, under a number 21 in a section titled XAIPE, originally published in 1950, when I was alive and maybe even speaking, if something reminded me of my mother.  Actually, she might not like this poem, so I think it's funny, if anyone can understand the humor in that.  These reviews aren't supposed to be by great critics; they are just supposed to say: buy this book.	2001-11-18

The scientists who were building the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos during World War II allowed Richard P. Feynman to become their expert in chain reactions and in solving mathematical equations, both highly abstract matters that are subject to mistakes when people think that they can jump right to the conclusion.  After the war, people who had been serving in the military for the duration were ready to get out, and the draft was being used to replace them; Feynman was found psychologically unsuitable for military service by the shrink who examined him for the draft board, and who must have thought that Richard P. Feynman was extraordinarily honest for an American, for Feynman was willing to admit that he heard the distinctively Hungarian accented voice of Edward Teller in his own head after Feynman met Teller, and the resonance of that idea might have been the perfect bit for giving any militaristic intellectual mental health care worker the creeps.  One of the exceedingly strange things about Feynman was that he thought workers should be aware of the dangers involved in the materials that they were working with, and the secret project that he was working on allowed him to go to Oak Ridge, Tennessee to warn those involved in uranium enrichment of the possibility of a chain reaction if some critical proximity threshold was crossed.  Depleted uranium is a substance that isn't concentrated enough to actually explode in a radioactive chain reaction, but the reluctance of the government to admit that other dangers might be present when tons of such stuff are used in battle might be an indication of how willing the government is to keep anything secret if it has any reason for not wanting people to know.  Feynman is lucky he was never tried by a military tribunal using secret evidence, but he seemed to feel awful about being found psychologically unsuitable, as his letter to the draft board which is printing in this book shows, at least to people who are as aware of thenature of a totally comic society as I am.  You might have to read this book to convince yourself that I'm not really making this stuff up.	2001-11-18

This book approaches technology the way a real philosopher, like Schopenhauer, would approach metaphysics; as typically demonstating the results of whatever faith was instilled in the thinker as a small child.  All of us had to learn that certain things work, and the bombs that we have built and paid for are the most outstanding example of how much faith we have been willing to invest in whatever works about nine times out of ten.  I think I looked down in a hole once that must have been hiding one of the number ten, dud bombs, covered with a little loose dirt so I couldn't see what had made such a round hole going down in that dirt after a B-52 had flown over high in the air.  If I tend to believe what this book says a bit more than the usual, highly skeptical reader or reviewer does, it might be because of that, or because I never really got to win a war or even call the shots.  I liked the observations of this book about the inverse relationship of complexity and reliability most of all.  Such empirically demonstrated observations ought to be the least political part of this book.  Anything further I might say is in danger of being too political.	2001-11-18

Section 312 of this book is called \\"my dog\\" (on a combination of being faithful, obtrusive and shameless, \\"just as entertaining, just as clever as every other dog\\" (p. 177), but it is about Nietzsche's relationship to his pain. There is another book by Nietzsche, THE WANDERER AND HIS SHADOW, in which section 38 mentions \\"The bite of conscience\\" as a stupidity, like the bite of a dog into a stone. (Portable Nietzsche, p. 68). There is also a section in THE GAY SCIENCE about beggars using a stone to knock where there is no bell. This translation has an entry in the index for \\"beggars, and courtesy.\\" The Walter Kaufmann translation listed section titles on pages ix-xviii, but Kaufmann didn't have an entry in the index for beggars or for bell, and though I may have rung Walter Kaufmann's bell a number of times, before and since I started writing reviews, my mental efforts to knock the war against the United Stoners of America has reached such a modern point of indifference in its approach to everything that what Walter Kaufmann thought about anything is of hardly any concern to those who would like an understanding of what is going on. I expect this book, which allows a comparison of minor differences on major matters, to be quite useful to me. I find it extremely comical when this translation makes something funny that in Walter Kaufmann's translation was only puzzling, but even the index of this book skips from women to words with no entry for wooden iron. There is no entry for iron between interruption, intuition, Islam, and Italian opera. But in the text itself, just before section 357 \\"On the old problem: `What is German?' \\" the end of section 356 raises the primary question any modern philosopher can face:<br />Free society? Well, well! But surely you know, gentlemen, what one needs to build that? Wooden iron! The famous wooden iron! And it need not even be wooden. (p. 217)	2001-11-18

Volume II of The World as Will and Representation is the most substantial portion of Schopenhauer's work for me.  There is a nice selection of ESSAYS AND APHORISMS from his 1851 work Parerga and Paralipomena, translated by R.J. Hollingdale into English in a Penguin Classics that provides a good summary of his views, and earlier works which established his ability to think in purely philosophical abstraction about things which largely escape me, and weren't quite grasped by Kant, if those who followed Kant were correct in how much philosophy they were willing to engage in.  The difficult comparison for me to make would be between Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, the only two German philosophers that I might wish to be equally familiar with, but the differences between those two are like life, for me, of which Schopenhauer said, &quot;Therefore many a great mind has had to drag itself breathlessly through life unrecognized, unhonored, unrewarded, till finally after his death the world became undeceived as to him and as to them.&quot;  (p. 163).  This, from Chapter XVII, &quot;On Man's Need for Metaphysics&quot; from Volume II of The World as Will and Representation, strikes me most forcefully as applying to anyone who would attempt to be the conscience for a nation.  The attempt to apply morals in such a nebulous manner is sure to arouse the kind of defense mechanisms noted by Schopenhauer in his view of those who &quot;Among the Greeks they were called sophists; among the moderns they are called professors of philosophy.&quot;  (p. 163)  Any great thought &quot;will cast too great a shadow over theirs, and moreover will not adapt itself to the aims and limitations of the guild.  For this reason they always endeavour to prevent such an achievement from finding favour.  The customary means for this purpose, according to the times and circumstances in each case, are concealing, covering up, suppressing, hushing up, ignoring, keeping secret, or denying, disparaging, censuring, slandering, distorting, or finally denouncing and persecuting.&quot;  (p. 163)  Readers of this book get to learn how even Kant wasn't secure in his position, after the king who appreciated his philosophy was dead, and playing a game like philosophy of the chair &quot;cannot pass for serious philosophy, but only for philosophy that is a joke.&quot;  (p. 164).  Perhaps Nietzsche succeeded in making philosophy that is a joke so obviously superior to what universities normally teach that our thoroughly comic society is the natural outcome of such logic.  This book forms a solid basis for that conclusion.	2001-11-16

I usually try to find the humor in the books which I read, but it usually isn't very polite to point it out.  When the Secret Service is through reading my psychiatric file, the government is sure to conclude that books like this are its best defense against grandiose individuals like me.  I have been happy when great poets have said things like &quot;What fools these mortals be,&quot; and then written comedies, which can be really awful in dreadful times like these, when all the words which could describe our feelings would definitely be offensive.  There was a South Park movie about a war with Canada that might even be considered funnier than the contents of this book, but Nam was a monumental failure for American foreign policy which inspired a lot of comments that make South Park comedy seem innocent in a little kid kind of way.  Most of the great old army jokes are beyond recall now, but this book brought back the F.T.A. bit, in its discussion of what Jane Fonda was all about.  When I was actually in the army, I found it strange that the army thought that I could get into serious trouble for saying &quot;F.T.A.&quot;, as if they had a right to be safe from any desire that I might have to Fun, Travel, and Adventure up the nature of the experience which they were actually having.  This book is a reminder of what the army was all about in that regard.	2001-11-13

I wish that I could start this discussion at the level of people who have already read this book, but the more likely possibility is that I'm about the only person trying to convince anyone that a certain discussion in this book might be considered important.  As much as I like Nietzsche, I tend to think about his approach only regarding a few problems that interest me.  I'm actually more interested in this book for its treatment of a problem in political philosophy that was considered important enough for Bacon's views to be included in this book, but, as hardly anyone can keep up with everything that is going on, my own curiosity about which views anyone might hold are rather mute in the ominous flow of events in our own time.<br />People who read Nietzsche might agree that he has arrived at a philosophy which attempts to describe the world as it strikes people in modern times.  The introduction of this book talks of partisans, but also of an understanding of them which allows a Hegelian \\"act of magic which preserves what is good for us in each inheritance while letting the junk fall away.  The recovery of Bacon and Descartes reestablishes a radical and sober perspective on our spiritual heritage; in their work our philosophic and religious inheritances come to light as spiritual opponents harboring starkly different dispositions to life, and their efforts, so far from harmonizing opposites, kindle spiritual warfare between them, the warfare Nietzsche advances and brings into the open.\\"  (pp. 4-5).  This book makes each of the three philosophers seem worthy of their places in the history of philosophy, but in our thoroughly comic society, the only question that those who don't know anything about this are likely to ask, is:  Who are these people trying to impress?<br />Chapter 4 of this book, \\"Why Incite a Holy War?\\" contains a discussion as six characters present views on a war like the clash of civilizations between the superpower military complex and the fanatics, except that Bacon was writing about a situation in the 1620s which also had a context of religious warfare between Christians within Europe.  Bacon had given a speech in \\"the prosecution of a young Roman Catholic named Owen indicted on charges of high treason for speeches advocating the lawfulness of killing a king who has been excommunicated.\\"  (p. 93).  That such an act might be blessed by a particular religion is noted by Lampert in his observation, \\"France, where Bacon's dialogue is now unfolding, had experienced the new doctrine still more directly in the blessed assassinations of its two previous kings.\\"  (p. 93).<br />An insult is as subversive of this kind of thing, as well as being great for avoiding any discussion today, for those who have been doing fine without an opinion so far.  This book credits one such statement to \\"Baconian Christianity whose charity has turned practical and technological,&quot; though it is offer in the discussion as merely an opinion, &quot;`That the Philosopher's Stone, and an Holy War, were but the rendez-vous of cracked brains, that wore their feather in their head instead of their hat.'\\"  (p. 87).  I don't have that kind of a hat, anymore, but it seems to me that modern education, which this book might represent, is teaching students to pay more attention to what hat they are wearing in a particular situation, as the discussion of a Holy War does, than to attend to anything which might be innate in their brains, which may be pretty unlikely in a society whose relentless messages are supposedly based on endless flexibility.<br />My big disagreement about these things goes back to the postmoral stance proclaimed on page 5, which is \\"heir to ten thousand years in the development of conscience.\\"  Dividing the 2,000,000 people in prison in the United States today by those 10,000 years might mean that, compared to what most of us have learned each year, there have always been another 200 people who didn't quite get it yet, and,if they were easy enough to catch, had to be added to the number of people in prison each year.  As embarrassing as it is to think about anything, expecting such precision in our thinking about how things really go has now become as unlikely as expecting any results from philosophy.  I shouldn't pick on a great book like this, but these are hard times.	2001-11-11

If you read this book, you might notice how one century tends to follow another, but certain problems could crop up, particularly in places which don't define the world quite like we do, philosophically or religiously.  I expected to spend a full weekend trying to figure out what this book has to say, but it dropped right into my preconceptions.<br />Some questions are more unsettling than others, and the question of spirit in Heidegger is worse when Derrida makes it perfectly clear that Heidegger knew how to avoid the question in purely philosophical works, firstly in Sein und Zeit, but treated spirit like a bandwagen that \\"the leap\\" (p. 32) would land on for those \\"in the movement of an authentication or identification which wish themselves to be properly German\\" (p. 33) in his famous Rectorship Address six years later, in 1933.  The key paragraph of that address pictures the Germans, for whom the \\"will to essence creates for our people its most intimate and extreme world of danger, in other words its true spiritual world.\\"  (p. 36)  My confusion about this doesn't really start until page 41, where \\"Spirit is its double.\\"  The consideration moves to the Einfuhrung (1935) which \\"repeats the invocation of spirit launched in the Address.  It even relaunches it, explains it, extends it, justifies it, specifies it, surrounds it with unprecedented precautions.\\"  (p. 41).  What has become a concern for Heidegger is \\"The darkening of the world implies this destitution of spirit, its dissolution, consuming, its repression, and its misinterpretation.  We are attempting at present to elucidate this destitution of spirit from just one perspective, and precisely that of the misinterpretation of spirit.  We have said:  Europe is caught in a vice between Russia and America, which metaphysically come down to the same thing in regard to their belonging to the world and their relation to spirit.\\"  (p. 59).  The collapse of German idealism a century earlier was, to Heidegger, the problem of an age \\"which was not strong enough to remain equal to the grandeur, the breadth, and the original authenticity of this spiritual world, that is, to realize it truly.\\"  (p. 60).  I dropped a lot of German words from the passages I quoted, and the bracketed \\"[to the character of their world, or rather to their character-of-world, Weltcharakter]\\", for the benefit of those who might have thought that he already said that.  Plenty of attention is paid to language, but of all the foreign words which might mean spirit, I'm barely aware of how the Latin word spiritus might be sung in church with a different meaning than how German philosophers arrogate about geistliche or Geistigkeit.  <br />Page 63 has a sentence on how the metaphysics of the latter word as well as the Christian value, \\"a word which will itself thus find itself doubled\\" form some \\"profound relationship with what is said twenty years earlier of the darkening of world and spirit.&quot;  (p. 63).  If you are following this, this might be the book for you, if you still want to know, \\"Heidegger names the demonic.  Evidently not the Evil Genius of Descartes . . .\\"  (p. 62).	2001-11-10

Reading this book was an exercise in democracy for me, and it wasn't too surprising to find the idea that promiscuous gay encounters are a much better paradigm for democracy than anything that heterosexists ever thought up.  At times, it hardly seems likely that any country will actually embrace democratic ideals as heartily as gay liberation has been emphasized in the American media, but this perspective serves to demonstrate a real relationship between political theory and the ideas in this book, and there are a lot of ideas in this book.<br />Before saying anything unfortunate, I should admit that my closest brush with insanity about these things might involve a sexual situation which was purely hetersexual, involving a woman who was proud that she was 18 years old and no longer subject to certain restrictions which our society imposes on children, but that my own belief that women turn into old frumps at the age of 28 was what made it crazy for me to think that she had a long way to go before she would be 28.  I really don't know enough about gay men to speculate on when any of them might reach my feelings on what they do and react in an insane manner about their own behavior, and it is pure speculation and fantasy on my part that any of them will ever look back on their behavior in quite the same way as a woman who has become an old frump who calls her husband at work every day to tell him, &quot;I love you,&quot; but who doesn't quite mean it the same way as when two of us were headed back to work, after lunch, and I told her, &quot;I forgot to nibble on your ear.&quot;	2001-11-07

I would consider this book as important for an understanding of what happened to the Branch Davidians in 1993 as the C.I.A. might consider having a secret office in New York City a possible gain for American intelligence.  The events of April 19, 1993 are not perfectly clear from the account in this book, but the screaming of Serenity Sea Jones, who was four years old at the time, is one of the details which is as striking in this account as in official testimony before Congress or wherever screaming children are discussed.  The TV quiz show, &quot;What Do Kids Know&quot; in the movie &quot;Magnolia,&quot; was strictly for ladies and germs, compared to the horror that the children in this book observed.  The author of this book was joined in a Branch Davidian marriage to the Jones girl who was the mother of Serenity Sea Jones, but he reports, &quot;She knew who her real father was.&quot;<br />As sacrilege goes, it is hard to beat what happened on April 19, 1993 as a collective re-enactment of the crucifixion, with a few modern public relations techniques thrown in, and the psychic sense of displacement can only be increased by recent reports that at a secret CIA office in a building at the foot of the World Trade Center towers was destroyed by falling buildings on September 11, 2001, so that security measures had to be taken to evacuate a large area and keep people out until every trace of American intelligence from that office had been found and destroyed.  This reminds me of what happened to the place the Branch Davidians were living in, particularly when the U.S. Congress was interested in finding their front door to check which directions the bullets going through that door had been fired from.  This book reports that David Koresh was shot on February 28, 1993, and I think it happened about the time he answered the door.  This book might also appeal to people who are not interested in what happened to American intelligence in New York City in 2001, but they maywonder why the author was so concerned that Waco, Texas was not actually located in Iraq.	2001-11-04

Philosophers have often fallen back on their affinity for the familiar, and this tendency may also be found in this book, especially in the attention it gives to current feminist thought, in spite of the churlishness that is occasionally to be found regarding those things which are out of the ordinary in a thoroughly distasteful way, as intentionally destructive acts often appear to be.  Though the book attempts to deal with psychologically troubling matters, there are thoroughly feminist moments, which are particularly heartwarming in regard to the innocence of financial planners, whose only connections to the World Trade Center towers were, at their best, in a manner which might previously have been regarded as impersonal and businesslike, and whose expectations implied that the accumulation of wealth through world trade was the sole context in which the activities that are entitled to the most significance in our world might be judged.  The best example of such thinking in this book, which is copyright 2001 but reflects the thinking dominant prior to the events of September 11, 2001, is its consideration of the ideas of Patricia Williams on &quot;the metaphor of investment instead of possession to convey social relations and their incumbent responsibility.  Imagining a more optimistic future, she says:  `What a world it would be if we could all wake up and see all of ourselves reflected in the world, not merely in a territorial sense but with a kind of nonexclusive entitlement that grants notso much possession as investment.'&quot;  (p. 155).  If there is a bombing campaign, or investment in weapons of mass destruction, or a war against drugs, or two million people in prison in the United States of America, going on right now, all of which are probably being rationalized by just about everybody as steps that must be taken so that we can have such an ideal world, with an economy which would be truly great, but actually, the way that things like this have been going on for the last 10,000 years suggests that, if we keep following our own tendencies on this, outer space might even become the new frontier for weapons which could be this destructive, if anyone with our instincts is allowed to use it to try to defend ourselves.  This book approaches reality on a lot of levels, but I may be the only person to read it who could find any support for my views in this book.  You can read it for yourself, too.	2001-10-29

I have previously described myself in a review as the most spaced-out poet on the planet, without describing the awful legal context in which such a view of myself is absolutely necessary. This book makes the context clear, but a general reader still might not understand how concrete this difficulty is because THE ANXIETY OF INFLUENCE is overtly a book about poetry, and hardly at all about exercising judgment. The page of the book where I left it open the longest, and where the book subsequently opened most easily, and which I read most often in the five weeks in which I was interested in this book, was page 58, which describes a poet who \\"experiences anxiety necessarily towards any danger that might end him as a poet.\\" Without dwelling on the personalities of the people involved, it seems to me that the anxiety which this book is about is clearest in the case of the presidential election of 2000, in which the ability of the Florida Supreme Court to act as the ultimate judges of that opportunity to count ballots was subject to the power of the United States Supreme Court to judge the election in some way which would produce a result which would be opposite to what a majority of the Florida Supreme Court desired. (...)and poets can be much more open about what they are doing than judges, so it isn't too surprising that this book is about poets.<br />Freud and Nietzsche form a nice frame of reference for what is happening in this book. I kept looking for mentions of Rilke, which wasn't fruitful until page 99, the first page on \\"Daemonization or The Counter-Sublime.\\" There it says, \\"History, to Rilke, was the index of men born too soon, but as a strong poet Rilke would not let himself know that art is the index of men born too late. . . . the dialectic between art and art, or what Rank was to call the artist's struggle against art . . . governed even Rilke, who outlasted most of his blocking agents, for in him the revisionary ratio of daemonization was stronger than inany other poet of our century.\\" There is a page just before page 99 which quotes Emerson on the highest truth about all things going well, \\"long intervals of time, years, centuries, are of no account.\\" (p. 98). Emerson shows up again on page 138, with the idea, \\"Who seem to die live,\\" to precede the final section of the book, \\"Apophrates or The Return of the Dead.\\" This part doesn't relate well to law, particularly for a system which keeps thinking that a judgment like the death penalty might be considered final at some point.	2001-10-28

This might not be a popular view of this particular book, but it has a lightening rod quality about it because it dwells on some things which I don't see a lot of anywhere else, particularly when it comes to facts.  Our society, technologically powerful and experts in communication, to boot, supports experts in a number of different areas.  The authors of this book are experts at reporting on factual situations, and the difficulty in reading the book is that the society has managed to condition people's minds to expect an endless stream of fantasy.  The amount of facts in this book exceeds the expectations of those whose minds have been probing fantasies for simple meanings which they can apply in their own lives to produce the kind of enjoyment which is what life is expected to be all about.  According to the index, this book doesn't even mention Jack Ruby until page 16, then dumps one of the most sensational events of the 20th century into the readers' laps with, &quot;in full view of millions watching on television, and in the packed basement of a citadel of authority, the Dallas police station, he had stepped up and shot the president's accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, in the abdomen at point-blank range.&quot;  (p. 17).  This kind of thing is bound to be confusing to people who are not interested enough to learn all about the circumstances.  Kaiser Sose isn't mentioned in this book at all, and the idea that anyone had to call Jack Ruby and tell him, *It's your hit, Jack* in order to make him think that he would be considered a great American hero by anyone who reads this book is only part of the confusion about what great American heroes are, anyway.  This book is for people who have a mind like a sponge, and know what it means when people start complaining that the arguments about this kind of thing are all wet.  Most people can't godown twice to the same river, when the flow of information gets to be this great, because they are used to everybody drifting helplessly on rivers of drivel.  This river isn't the easiest thing to swim in.	2001-10-28

My favorite page of this book is page 84, which has some small print at the bottom of the page, &quot;Lenin sees Trotsky's position as attractive but too risky.&quot; The illustration shows a three-way argument among the leaders of the Bolshevik Central Committee on how to get an immediate armistice with Germany in World War One, for which Trotsky had been sent to Brest-Litovsk to negotiate peace at the end of November 1917. Somehow, page 82 reported, &quot;The Allied Powers are desperately against Russia signing a separate peace with Germany.&quot; Trotsky's position in the argument on page 84 nicely avoided the possibility of conflict with the Allied Powers, &quot;Prolong the negotiations. No war - No Peace - till the German workers revolt!&quot; According to page 83, &quot;The peace delegation at Brest-Litovsk distributed pamphlets to the German soldiers.&quot; The cartoon shows a soldier looking at a page and exclaiming, &quot;It says - shoot your officers!!&quot; The Germans might not have been used to reading that kind of thing, but there is a historical Who's Who on pages 168 to 173 which shows how much support there was for this when someone's idea of justice supported it. The Who's Who contains anarchist activists like Vera Zasulich, a Narodnik militant who &quot;Shot and wounded the Governor of St. Petersburg, General Tepov&quot; [which might not be spelled correctly] because a Narodnik student &quot;was flogged for failing to remove his hat in Trepov's presence. Her trial and acquittal by the jury caused a sensation and was popularly supported.&quot; (p. 173). Back on page 76, following a cartoon that looks a lot like some famous painting of the last supper, there is even a picture of Joseph Stalin, who praised Trotsky in Pravda for the &quot;practical organisation of the insurrection&quot; (The October Revolution) only 84 years ago in November 1917, but the picture is saying, &quot;I said that? No - you must be thinking of some other Stalin!&quot; The humor of history is perfect for a cartoon book like this, which is history at a level which everybody ought to be able to understand. Unfortunately for the Soviets, they were probably not aware of the work of the young Karl Kraus in Vienna during this period, who observed, &quot;Satires which the censor understands are rightly prohibited.&quot;  This book is too true to be considered satire in a thoroughly comic society like our own.	2001-10-28

I used to think that I knew the words of the Scroobius Pip in this poem, more or less, since each word could have been the same as in the verse before it, simply repeating a line at the end of each verse, as the words of the chorus of a song have a tendency to show up, one at a time, each in their proper places; but when the Scroobious Pip has something to say, like &quot;Chippetty flip!  Flippetty chip!  My only name is the Scroobious Pip!&quot; it might come out, &quot;Flippetty chip!  Chippetty flip!&quot; or &quot;with a liquid sound, Pliffity flip!  Pliffity flip!&quot; or &quot;with a whistly sound, Wizzeby wip!  Wizzeby wip!&quot; or &quot;Chippetty tip!  Chippetty tip!&quot;  My dictionary had a lot of definitions for pip which weren't much help in understanding what this poem is all about.  I thought a pip would be something small, but the dictionary thought it might even be British slang for a &quot;metal insigne of rank on the shoulders of commissioned officers.&quot;  There is an interpretation of the word, pip, as a verb, applying to a young bird chipping a hole in the shell of its egg.  The pictures of the Scroobious Pip in this book don't look like it just crawled out of a shell, but the curiousity which is expressed might apply to something which has just been born as well as to something which is unusual because it defies classification.  If wearing glasses and having a feathery beard, horns like a goat and a beak like a parrot or owl might be considered signs of wisdom, the hero of this book is being shown as a wise whatever it is, as well as being impeccably dressed in a coat and vest.  The illustrations by Nancy Ekholm Burkert in the edition that I have (Harper &amp; Row, 1968) are excellent, and she also did the Foreword, which says, &quot;It is this ideal of harmony between ourselves and nature which I feel is present in the rhythmic verses of The Scroobious Pip and which made me so want to illustrate them.&quot;	2001-10-28

I bought this book at a time when Nietzsche's works interested me much more than anything that real people had to say about Nietzsche.  When I was a youth, a commission had been appointed to try to understand a series of riots, and my reading of Nietzsche was more sympathetic to those who had reasons for trying to demoralize the old order, a motive which I always have read into Nietzsche, than any professor would admit.  But I was being ignored, along with my efforts to ridicule people who thought they could outsmart Nietzsche by being more moral or better educated in modern intellectual survival mechanisms.  I wasn't talented enough, musically, to be a rock 'n' roller, (this was about the time someone at work told me I could play guitar, &quot;But don't sing,&quot;) so it seemed natural to me that college professors weren't astute enough to make their criticisms of Nietzsche stick with me, particularly when rocking out seemed much closer to my escape mechanisms than the loss of self which I could experience by actually understanding Nietzsche in a sense that defied any explanation.  I probably bought this book in 1995, when it seemed to be the newest work in the field on Nietzsche's relation to the feminine, and my luck in finding an attempt to plumb the deepest portions of that relationship through striking surveys of the psychological field of thought in this area was great.  I believe this book is still in print, an accomplishment which has eluded a number of other works on this topic, and it really is time to start taking this one seriously.<br />My first great discovery in this book was its discussion of the comedians of the ascetic ideal.  A lot of what I learned was in the notes at the end of the book, but Kelly Oliver clearly captured Nietzsche's relationship to the ascetic ideal on page 42 with her description, &quot;Like the plundering soldier, he steals its armor and wears it mockingly, making fun of his enemy.  By doing so, however, he is always also mocking himself. . . . This laughter is the only thing that sets the faker apart from the real thing.&quot;  As a philosopher, Nietzsche definitely mocks himself, but picturing him as a plundering soldier, his laughter appears to be the most real thing about him, and any trouble that I have been in is a sure sign that I am too close to the truth on this point.<br />The other parts of this book which I could comment on might be considered equally troubling, but the index is helpful in tracking down where this book is really great, and my favorite entry, which might be considered a concept which summarizes the kind of confusion that this book is attempting to avoid more often than not, is metaforeplay.	2001-10-26

All it took to get Fichte to collapse into a claim that he was merely a philosopher by 1800, when he wrote a few of his defenses in this book, was the charge that he was being atheistic in his faith in a moral world order rather than the kind of proofs of God that Kant had found unconvincing.  His ideas about a moral world order make more sense to me as a philosophy than the concepts that make up more of this book.  In our time, being considered an atheist has its defenders among those who consider themselves as respectable as other people, so I can't sympathize with those educated people who believe that God can't be defined in a moral way.  There still is a tendency to condemn individuals for clinging to their own views, and Fichte's admission that any minister who declared from the pulpit that Fichte now has it right, while the church has been wrong all these years, could be removed from his pulpit for official incompetence.  Philosophy is not really being defended against much when the main defense is that it is just a philosophy.  The moral world order may be even less believable now, since Kafka and Walter Kaufmann in EXISTENTIALISM FROM DOSTOEVSKY TO SARTRE declare that the moral order is based on a lie.  Fichte is lucky he didn't try saying that in 1800.	2001-06-29

This book has been rightly praised as a guide to an individual's philosophy, as if we can all accept that Hegel had an individual self entitled to pick and choose among the many reactions to the intellectual currents which had been generated in his time by Kant, Goethe, Schelling, and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762-1814), who is discussed in a section on pages 85-96 of this book but is not listed in the index.  I had intended to count refernces to Fichte in this book before writing my review, so customers would have some idea how often I looked at the pages of this book, but that would have been tedious.  Most often Fichte was merely mentioned as another self, whom we are expected to believe was entitled to choose from the intellectual currents of his time much as a chairman at a political convention might officially state, &quot;The chair recognizes the floor.&quot;  Of course Fichte thought he could do more than that with Kant's philosophy, as Solomon shows in his typical comment:  &quot;And it is in this morass of ambitions, hostilities, and mixed interpretations that the seemingly simple progression, from Kant to Fichte to Schelling to Hegel, has to be viewed&quot; (p. 85).  Note 41 at that point mentions &quot;one of the best-known post-Kantians, Arthur Schopenhauer,&quot; who was omitted in the simple progression because his &quot;notoriety&quot; came later.  Those who have criticized Schopenhauer (see Witold Gombrowicz, PHILOSOPHY IN SIX LESSONS AND A QUARTER, for someone who considers a lot of these philosophers Polish, and still criticizes them) are likely to picture Schopenhauer going through the roof as a primary feature of Schopenhauer's philosophy.  Hegel, as a professor, does not have quite that much freedom, and involvement in philosophy might be considered his greatness because it is obviously his effort to cling to the floor in the midst of mounting outrageousness.  Solomon does a pretty good job of staying on the floor, too.  Only a poet would read this stuff and think, &quot;We shovel a grave in the air there you won't lie too cramped,&quot; as Paul Celan wrote in a famous poem after World War II, only in German.	2001-04-27

This novel from 1967 or 1968 tried to encompass the politics of death by picking the ghost of a Jewish comedian to complain about all the impositions which society may impose upon &quot;Peace to our ashes.&quot;  In the movie version, the ghost complains that the unappreciated comic's line, &quot;I died out there,&quot; applies to him in a literal way.  I could appreciate the comedy of this book before I went to Nam, so it seemed strange to me that the selective service would send a person with such an inappropriate emotional response, my love of ghosts, to Vietnam.  By 1968, times were so desparate that they, my local draft board, thought it ought to be their choice more than mine, and I didn't have anything to bet on the outcome but my life.  The 20th century would be taken far more seriously than it deserves to be, at this late date, if anyone still thinks that really, my sense of humor should have died out there.

These deathbed notes, taken by a wife and friend of Gombrowicz up to Sunday, May 25, 1969, when he admitted, &quot;Existentialism drowns in life, it is within existence, but also considers itself to be a vital act (strangely enough)&quot; (pp. 98-99) begins with a first lesson on April 27, 1969.  Descartes might be considered the beginning of modern philosophy, but Gombrowicz thought he gave in to fear.  For those who have considered reading Kant, but never wanted to risk that much confusion, it might be difficult to believe the point for which he gets the most credit from Gombrowicz.  &quot;Kant seeks precision.  He tightens reality.  Solid mind.&quot;  (p. 24)  &quot;It is with Kant that the great reduction of thought begins, a process lasting to this day.&quot;  (p. 25)  I'm a firm believer now, in the more you watch, the less you know about a lot of things, and it is from that perspective that these short notes make the most sense, I hope.  The only mention of most of the ancient Greek philosophers is in the attempt by Gombrowicz to describe &quot;the equilibrium condemned by Nietzsche, whereas Euripides and Aristophanes proclaim the vital law.&quot;  (p. 94)  If somehow Gombrowicz had lived until the year 2001, I doubt if he would still be describing any kind of law as vital.	2001-04-12

I had not realized until this year how much we are living in an age after Archilochus.  The philologists of Germany at the time of Nietzsche's education had such exalted views of Archilochus that one of their experts, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Mollendorff in a reply to Nietzsche's first book, THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC, complained, &quot;As unbelievable as it might sound, Mr. N. has the audacity to compare Archilochan poetry with folk songs . . .&quot; FUTURE PHILOLOGY! A REPLY TO THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY BY FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, English translation in &quot;New Nietzsche Studies,&quot; Volume 4:1/2 Summer/Fall 2000, page 10.  Further research by me indicated that the footnote on page 11 of that journal, which indicated that when his girlfriend's father &quot;refused to grant her hand in marriage to Archilochus, he retaliated with such venomous satires that it is said that both the father and daughter hung themselves,&quot; might understate the number of people who hung themselves.  This book helps translate the popularity of Archilochus into modern English for today's scholars, with a good bit of attention for the few other poets who retain enduring interest for real folksingers and their fans.  Please love these people in spite of their faults, and try to appreciate the soundtracks if you ever go to movies, which continue to base plots on the themes covered in this book.	2001-04-06

Some things that I have previously written about fools were undoubtedly reinforced by my earlier attempt to gain something from this book.  Now that I have returned to this book with all the seriousness that creative intellectual labor demands when it is not in a good mood, my concern is with a portion of Chapter 4, &quot;The Phantom Friend Returning (in the name of `Democracy')&quot; stated most concisely on pages 81-82, &quot;with neither consciousness nor memory of its compulsive droning&quot; being applied to &quot;what has become the real structure of the political ~ . . . the marks and the discourse that give it form ~ to allow us to speak of them in such a way today, seriously and solemnly?&quot;  Whatever is being discussed here is leading to a German thinker on page 83:  &quot;This tradition takes on systematic form in the work of Carl Schmitt.&quot;  The flip side of things is actually the case.  &quot;As soon as war is possible, it is taking place, . . . in a society of combat, in a community presently at war, since it can present itself to itself, as such, only in reference to this possible war.&quot;  (p. 86)  &quot;The concept of the enemy is . . . the very concept of the political.&quot;  (p. 86)<br />Perhaps this is only serious in a sense in which psychosis might be considered serious, or a political professional might be considered engaged in something like the practice of law, or a majority of the Supreme Court might think that people shouldn't count... because their wishes and desires will prevent them from maintaining any hard and fast rules about how they are counting.  This is about the same as the democratic principles for friendship which are the topic of this book.  Comedians might have predicted that if a presidency were to go, either to a guy that they thought was too smart, or to the dumb guy, the law ought to prefer the dumb guy anyway, because the law is like comedy, playing to the same audience.  It might not always be right, but theaudience always gets the jokes about the dumb guy.  Derrida is not providing an index or bibliography with this work, just notes at the end of the chapters, so it wasn't easy for me to find comic elements of this book to pursue.  I think he is fond of more troubling aspects of reality, like TRAGIC WAYS OF KILLING A WOMAN by Nicole Loraux and the usual Greek philosophers.  As far as my concerns about the war on drugs, he provides some reasons for thinking that with the powers of high altitude herbicide spraying available today, we are capable of destroying much more of Columbia for each opium user here at home than back when Nietzsche was taking opium.  When Derrida wrote this book, he might not have been thinking that the United States would be doing that by now, but it must be true.	2001-02-24

The tone and pacing here are much different, if your normal point of view is the kind of thriller pace achieved by Joyce Carol Oates in her story in the January 2001 Playboy, for example, where the reader has to race to the end to discover how Babs is taking all this, if that is still possible.  This book is more like a picture as it actually develops: two eyes, a nose, a mouth, and definitely a space between the two ears where there is a danger that all her favorite laws may end up being Rendquisted (and twisted, or did I say that?) when she has to face how likely it is that anyone will be just.  There is some consideration of gazing, staring, and generally annoying behavior, and this book ought to be good for people who are that kind of gluttons for punishment.	2000-12-25

I had just enough background in engineering and drafting to realize that I could duplicate the basic patterns here to create my own little twisty things whenever I want to produce an amazing surprise. With color photocopying on cardstock, and by laminating photographic paper which was too flimsy to work with, it has been possible for me to create hundreds of these converging convolutions of my own design within the last six years.<br><br>In the edition I have, a design called \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is discussed on page 44. The basics are pretty obvious, like \\"wingtips of angels and devils are joined to form the outline of right triangles contained in a square.\\" Overall, what is illustrated is that \\"Interlocking motifs depicting opposites\\" can be used to emphasize \\"the inability to recognize one without the other.\\"  This kind of playing with opposite valuations makes the most sense in a context like jokes,! where only people who dare to get in trouble would try anything which might be considered too personal.  I was younger when I thought that these things might be a lot of fun, and I have given away most of the items that I was able to produce from the book, while I still have a vast quantity of the ones which I designed myself.  The main reason I know better now (the ones in the book are not as intrusive) is because my own personal applications have often encountered morality on a level that is frightening to particular individuals.  I should refrain from offering any samples of how a Pop Up Poem Book could make some aspect of a person (or worse, a line someone said which would be perfect in a poem) into poetry in motion, but such a person might become too self-conscious to continue to be subject to such scrutiny. It happens.  As with my reviews, my own designs try to reflect some aspect of myself, as when they contain some kind of surprise, and I've started calling them nuker!plunkers instead of convolutions, so people have the opportunity to use their imaginations in considering what I might be giving them when I tell them, \\"Have a nukerplunker.\\"	2000-12-20

What is truly frightening about this situation is the realization that any excuse, race, use of illegal drugs, possession of weapons, sleeping in the Chinese embassy on the night of May 7, 1999, having a sinful Messiah for a minister, putting kids in daycare in a federal building, etc., might end up being considered a deadly mistake if those who have high-powered explosives are working in a system which will allow them to blame one of their enemies for the tragedy which will be the subject of the news.<br />I happened to be reading a book on the KGB before I started reading this, and the situation at the time of the death of Stalin, then Beria, seems to fall in the sense of how this book claims that individuals don't matter to the system.  Once Stalin was dead, having served Stalin was of no benefit to Beria.  When Stalin was ruler, it was dangerous for anyone to get more votes than Stalin, as Kirov did shortly before his death.  The denunciations of Stalin which followed Stalin's death did not end the practices which Stalin had been denounced for engaging in, any more than the attempt to impeach an America president in 1999 prevented any American from lying about his private life under oath forever after.<br />Long after this book was written, the political system in the Soviet Union started to allow a broader selection of candidates, and Sakharov was the most popular politician in the Soviet Union at the time of his death from a heart attack.  Sakharov had been an inventor of a sandwich design hydrogen bomb, which was first successfuly tested by dropping it from an airplane on November 22, 1955, a mere 8 years before an American president died under more suspicious circumstances, possiblyrelated to his support for a ban on such tests.<br />I haven't forgotten that someone posted a message after I had reviewed a book which didn't discuss any nuclear weapons whatever.  This shows what kind of thing can happen when a person who reads a lot gets involved with those whose totalitarianism expects more respect than I happen to believe that any media deserve at the moment.  Not everything that I have written has been posted, and it might be easiest for me to complain about family values totalitarianism.  No one would think that the things which are done are limited to those acts which could be printed in a family newspaper, but the media can use family values as an excuse to ignore the most upsetting stories.  Reviews of books are not supposed to get too personal, but sometimes the subject matter of the account makes any attempt to comprehend what is in the book offensive.  In my own case, I tried to review a book by Gennifer Flowers called PASSION AND BETRAYAL in which the personal is covered by a little black nightie, but not for long.  This might be personally embarrassing for the author and a friend of hers, but the danger that some form of totalianism might be criticized in that book would hardly occur to anyone who did not know about the episode when her neighbor with the video camera was getting beat up by guys who kept asking, &quot;Where's the tape?&quot;	2000-09-30

I should start with a German named Reinhard Gehlen, whose position on the eastern front in WW II is directly tied in this book to the position from which he retired in 1968.  Assuming that allied intelligence adopted any of the methods which are referred to as secret operations, and that the Oklahoma City grand jury was in danger of asking questions of federal agents which might have revealed some methods or people involved in secret operations, the information revealed in this book follows a certain logic, but it might be described as having way too much Zen to be admitted openly, and the government may have reasons for thinking that this book should be hard to find.	2000-09-26

This is not a topic which I would expect to be popular now, as most emphasis has been shifted to deadly confrontations, and the only major death in this play is of a suspect who was hanging out of a police department window before he dropped to his death.  In the history of people being pick up for interrogation, this might be as famous someplace in Italy as the Biko case in South Africa, where police in Port Elizabeth picked Biko up and slammed him against the wall because he was not cooperating fully in their investigation of his attitude toward law and order.<br />I thought that the theme of the play was that the police get overly zealous in trying to pin a crime on a particular person once the police have made up their collective minds who they think should have committed the crime, as the defense allegations in the famous O.J. murder case seemed well founded when the methods of the L.A.P.D. were subject to the scrutiny of attorneys who are aware of how these things are usually done.  In the case of the actual event upon which the Accidental Death of the Anarchist was based, the police techniques were subject to an official investigation, and the play was written as on ongoing farce which kept Italy informed as more facts came to light.  The play may be way beyond the Zen of any audience, but if people think that something about the nature of the police is revealed in it, I don't think that those people should be considered as paranoid as they ought to be.  Anyone who loses sleep over this kind of thing hasn't adjusted well to modern society, so they can probably find a shrink to give them pills that will put them to sleep, but that is a different topic, but not much different, really.	2000-09-26

It is the opinion of George J. Stack that  the great American sage of Concord was more than simply words upon a page  for Nietzsche, who is widely studied by those who have some interest in  philosophy.  As a professor of philosophy (chair of that department at the  State University of New York at Brockport, according to the back cover of  this book), Stack sees how the important elements of philosophy can be  pulled from Nietzsche's works as from a house of cards, and the entire deck  can be handed over to Ralph Waldo Emerson.  One of his points about  Emerson: &quot;Quite often he attacks social institutions, freely knocking  down the `house of cards' of which, he believes, they are made.  Society is  viewed as at war with individuals, as a leveling force that resents  genuinely independent people.&quot;  (p. 37)  The major fault of this book  is its failure to realize how long philosophy has been pulling the same  trick, with similar results, on different houses of cards.<br />Perhaps this  book reflects a level of scholarship that has no qualms about being in a  young country, based on a single language.  It is easy here to forget that  Nietzsche was born in Germany, as was Walter Kaufmann (1921-1980), an  American professor who allowed his students to know when the ideas that  they acquired had a German background.  Nietzsche was once a young  professor lecturing on the ancient Greeks, and it is most surprising here  to find Stack criticizing Kaufmann for calling attention to a Greek,  Aristotle, in the midst of Nietzsche's thoughts on &quot;greatness of  soul.&quot;  In Stack's opinion, &quot;his portrait of greatness owes far  more to Emerson than to Aristotle.&quot;  (p. 298)  Perhaps Emerson, in a  more modern setting, was able to put the idea of greatness into words which  it was easier for Stack, a thoroughly modern professor, to understand,  while Aristotle was having to put the concept into word that his pupil,  Alexander the Great, could apply in practice when Alexander was king from  the age of 20 until his death at the age of 33.  Stack shows a very liberal  idea of leadership when he reports, &quot;Alexander the Great's intense  desire for military conquest is mild compared to Plato's intellectual  `ambition.'&quot;  (p. 156)  Stack knows this because of something that he  read on page 317 of The Portable Emerson.<br />Emerson also wrote, in &quot;Of  Friends,&quot; about friendship, a topic which has been a classic since  Florian wrote &quot;My friends, there are no friends.&quot;  I believe I  found this on page 46 of POLITICS OF FRIENDSHIP by Jacques Derrida,  translated by George Collins (1997) as well as on page 48 this book by  Stack, whose sage is always Emerson.  So many times, when Stack is thinking  of Emerson, the real experience is one of Nietzsche, and &quot;One can  understand, Nietzsche writes, the bitter remark of `the sage': `Friends,  there are no friends.'&quot;<br />In my own experiences, instead of doing  this, I should be working on THE NEW VIETNAM WAR COMEDY TEAM JOKE BOOK.  In  my humble opinion, Nietzsche and I would make a better comedy team in a  joke book than Emerson and I could ever be.  Possibly Stack never meant to  have Nietzsche and Emerson evaluated as a comedy team.  I'm not  recommending it.	2000-09-12

This made it easy for me to pick Walter Kaufmann as a professor and editor who would be widely  recognized as being a leader in this field.  In turn, it may have been his  feeling, at some point, that I was less philosophical than he was.  If that  was a game, like chess, I might easily concede, and stop playing a game  which depended on such mastery of obscure possibilities.  When I was in  high school, I had to read Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky, who is also  represented in this volume.  More than I am interested in philosophy, I  would like to understand Dostoevsky's comment on page 76 of this book:   &quot;Gentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not  brilliant, but you know one can't take everything as a joke.  I am,  perhaps, jesting against the grain.&quot;  I had expected philosophy to be  an attempted rationalization of existence, as my previous training in  religious thought had emphasized acceptance of whatever is expected to be  accepted above all else.<br />I would expect this book to appeal mainly to  those who have an interest in philosophy.  The class that I was in didn't  attempt to read or discuss those selections which the professor considered  too difficult (we were not a group that was expected to argue, just  understand), but this book seemed to be pointing us in a reasonable  direction when we left it and took a better look at the philosophy of  Camus, contained in a book which concluded with the chapter which also  concludes this volume, &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus.&quot;  The final  sentence there, &quot;One must imagine Sisyphus happy,&quot; (p. 315)  suggested that perhaps Sisyphus had discovered the best joke for describing  what this field is all about.  My vote would be for the idea on page 312,  &quot;To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the  gods.  He stole theirsecrets.&quot;	2000-07-30

Possibly music preceded speech in the development of human civilization.  I couldn't find anything on bees in the  index, but I'll bet a bee that has discovered something communicates its  findings when it gets back to the hive by doing some kind of dance.  The  index of this book has some entries for Bach, beauty, and Beethoven, but a  modern consciousness of how these people with great skill have managed to  achieve anything in this area gets translated into such technical jargon as   chord changes, chord inversion, chord progression, picking a few terms in  the index that I am capable of understanding.  This book is written by a  college professor who usually writes about philosophy, so the index is more  inclined to provide information to those who wish to research the  subjective character of aesthetic experience.  I was more interested in the  moral danger of music, which is examined as a &quot;dilemma&quot; on pages  6-8, 191-94, and 200.  I would not expect this book to ruin your life, but  I can't force you to read it.  People who need to look up the favorite  drinking song of Immanuel Kant ought to buy this book.  Higgins makes much  of the modern world seem less enlightened than Kant when she observes,  &quot;Kant's acceptance of instrumental music as legitimate music is thus a  progressive view for his time.&quot;  (p. 64)  However, &quot;while  admitting that 'agreeable' music of minimal content exists, Kant judges it  harshly.&quot;  (p. 65)  An aspect of books that I have not previously  discussed in reviews is name-dropping.

I am definitely not a professional in this field, and I highly suspect that most people who engage in a professional practice of some kind have some secrets.  For lawyers, certain privileges prevent the disclosure of  confidential information, and certain corporations are run by executives  who feel that any information pertaining to their business deserves the  same hidden status.<br />This book, mainly about a field in which what is  secret is mostly what everybody knows, is a very knowledgeable attempt to  show how the use of the idea, &quot;Know yourself&quot; by experts in  pursuit of some cure for the problems which individuals encounter in life  may wreak havoc when combined with the ambitions of those who seek  professional advancement.  Exposing Freud's secrets is a theme that is so  close to the practice of psychoanalysis itself that the approach taken by  this book should be obvious to anyone who has taken time to reflect, which  his opponents have definitely done here, and have had plenty of time to  sharpen their arguments against Freud's theories, in fuller appreciation of  the mental catastrophies which have been produced by Freud's own  applications of his principles.  The examples which strike me most sharply  involve a divorce advised by Freud for Horace Frink, the brightest star in  the New York Psychoanalytic Association, to allow him to marry heiress  Angelika Bijur.  According to page 270 of this book, Freud wrote to Frink  in November 1921 that &quot;Your complaint that you cannot grasp your  homosexuality implies that you are not yet aware of your phantasy of making  me a rich man.  If matters turn out all right let us change this imaginary  gift into a real contribution to the Psychoanalytic Funds.&quot;<br />The Emma  Eckstein case, which involved the removal of the middle left concha in her  nose by Wilhelm Fliess, who had a theory about a &quot;nasal reflex  neurosis,&quot; (p. 55) has been explained more fully elsewhere by Max  Schur andRobert Wilcocks, duly mentioned by Crews.  This might relate more  to the generally clueless nature of medical experiments than to Freud's  practice if Freud hadn't try to absolve Fliess for a botched, superfluous  operation.  I would just like to add that if anyone wants to be friends, or  maybe just colleagues, with people like this, get used to this kind of  thing.	2000-07-23

An introduction to this book which depends entirely on a religious point of view might seem strange to the  casual shopper, but it suggests the spirit in which this book might be  brought into view with a certain humility.<br />I used to go to church a lot  because it provided an opportunity to think.  I have also gone to hear the  author of this book speak for the same reason, but with much deeper  results, because Robert Jay Lifton, at the time of the 50th anniversary of  the atomic attack on Hiroshima, was in a perfect position to accuse the  American President who tried to explain the attack, Harry Truman, of  confabulating when he combined the elements of the situation in a way which  was not quite factual.  My impression of Lifton at that time was that he  was quite old, and not open to the perverse glee that a personal encounter  with me might provide, so we didn't quite meet.  Given the differences  between us, it should be obvious that he has written a much better book on  the topic of Apocalyptic Violence than I ever could, embracing a wealth of  detail with relentless fascination.  Early in the book, on page 16, typical  psychological judgments are considered insignificant, as Freud's  association with the resolution of the Oedipus complex is compared to the  possibility of a guru who can face a real &quot;call to greatness, and a  series of ordeals and trials culminating in heroic achievement.&quot;   Religious greatness can surpass the usual psychological norm when it is  possible to demonstrate &quot;the hero's achievement of special knowledge  of, or mastery over, death, which can in turn enhance the life of his  people.&quot;  Most of this book reports on terrible events, including the  creation of weapons.  The guru who is the subject of this book was born in  1955, and the events are quite recent.  I see no reason to dispute that the  peopleinvolved were thinking in the manner that is reported in this book.   Some readers might consider this excessively factual, but people with books  ought to be able to get real like this once in a while, too.	2000-07-21

However appropriate that may have  been, or crippled, as the case may be, and however dubious any claims of  immunity which were made in the movie seemed to me, the sentence which  brought this to mind seems especially puzzling.  &quot;In the parade of  industrious fathers and sons, productive husbands and wives, pious and pure  brothers and sisters, and invisible but efficient mothers, in the  procession of all the loves and execrations of the family romance, Genet  limps along like Kaiser Sose behind a Hegel on the march.&quot;  (p. 150)   This consideration of &quot;love in the family, or in whatever is left of  families,&quot; (p. 151) is in the chapter before the one devoted to  Augustine's Confessions.	2000-07-19

By writing about nature in a way that emphasized the  power of fire, war, and strife, Heraclitus produced a book that was so well  known to ancient writers that many of them lifted ideas for their own  purposes.  This combination of the knowledge that we have from many sources  produces a picture of the permutations that basic philosophy is prone to  fall prey to in a history which never finds any particular idea useful for  long.  I find the application of such ideas most interesting in the field  of deep politics, where the idea of &quot;killing the killers,&quot;  mentioned in connection with the riddle which Homer couldn't guess at the  time of his death according to the tradition explained in this book, could  be related to some modern despicabilities.	2000-07-18

But having Hosea in the Bible might be a sign that the pious feel that they are entitled to complain about this kind of thing, regardless of the kind of vicious attacks or circumstances which might really be troubling people.  It shouldn't be surprising that a tape with this kind of commentary would be produced by someone who was religious. The tension which an in depth study of Hosea ought to produce arises from the realization of how common the condemnations which he brought into the Bible are in a lot of places that aren't churches. The danger of this kind of sermon is that it will mention something which would not normally be brought up in polite society. I would have rated this higher if it was less typical, but it was about what I expected.	2000-07-18

As might be expected from someone aware of the intellectual climate in which they worked, a great  deal of attention is devoted to the sorry state of their relationships with  each other, ambition being an obstacle to agreement in this field.  The  scholarly view offered by the college professor who put this collection of  observations together is most daring when it offers a challenge to the  individual attempt to make sense of a truly ominous situation, as when  Walter Kaufmann tackles Jung's &quot;Answer to Job.&quot;<br />Listen,  football fans: when the ball gets loose like this, people start to think  about the last opportunity that they had to drop back and punt.  According  to my Concordance to the King James Version of the Bible, in Job 31:33, Job  admitted, in his attempts to justify himself, that he would have sinned if  he hid his transgressions like Adam.  This is followed by a speech by Elihu  in which his anger burst out.  The key to his anger is contained in Job  34:17, &quot;Could an enemy of justice ever govern?&quot;<br />In the strange  world that we actually live in, people would be well advised to get used to  this kind of thing when they are young, so that, later in life, if they  ever encounter anyone who has a more outrageous theory about what is really  going on, their contact with the intellectual upper crust will remind them  of how goofy this kind of thing usually turns out to be.

My thought was:  Zeus.&quot;  This experience is a link to the antiquity also experienced in  the Biblical book of Job, in the speech of Elihu, at Job 36:27-33 and Job  37:3-24, leading up to the speeches of Yahweh.  By page 7 of this  translation of the seminar, Heidegger is demonstrating his link with  &quot;Fr. 1&quot; of Heraclitus by quoting more than five lines in the  original ancient Greek.  Those who would prefer to know the English are  given the Diels version in Note 3 on page 163.  I find that Note 4, the  Diels translation of Fragment 7, quoted (in Greek) by Eugen Fink in the  second session of these seminars, is a bit easier for me to understand.   The Glossary on pages 166 to 169 is a great guide to the Greek words for  the major topics in this book.  There is no index, but the approach being  pursued in the fashion of this book could hardly gain any clarity by an  attempt to locate the ideas in this book by any system related to page  numbers.  My comment on this reflects Heidegger's reaction to a participant  who noted that the first philosophical dictionary didn't occur until  Aristotle.  (p. 7)  Before things were sorted out, Heraclitus was trying to  communicate something in Fr. 11 about &quot;Everything that crawls . .  .&quot; (p. 31).  The excitement picks up on page 32, when Fink quotes a  poem by Holderlin called &quot;Voice of the People.&quot;	2000-07-15

On a personal  level, I would just like to add that part of the fun of observing the  operation of a great enterprise like Harvard was in suspecting that such  things were genuinely dubious, and a real individual would derive more  pleasure in being able to say that having a mind that has been criticized  at Harvard for having perverse reasons for being there (inappropriate  laughter being worse there than anywhere) is not as pleasing as receiving a  rejection letter from their alumni rag (Harvard Magazine) written by an  editor who clearly felt that an article examining the question, &quot;Is MY  VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK an ascetic ideal?&quot; would be puzzling for most of  the readers of that magazine.  People who think that Harvard can't have it  both ways on a question like that don't know Harvard.	2000-07-14

The overly theologically correct versions of scripture (New  Revised something) used in the churches that I have been to lately seem  much milder than the reading which I am likely to find most interesting,  but I should avoid striking at differences in a scope of things which is  this vast.  A year ago, I appreciated this book most for containing an  account of the death of Razis in 2 Maccabees 14: 37-46.  I was reading a  book by Nietzsche called DAYBREAK, and a close study of the notes in the  back of that book will reveal the section of text in which Nietzsche raised  the question of whether the entrails which Razis tore out and flung at the  troops with both hands would be restored to his body at the time of the  resurrection.  One of the heroes of Chapter 14 of 2 Maccabees seems to be  named Judas Maccabaeus, who became a friend of a former commander of the  elephants after an arranged peace in which &quot;Judas married, settled  down and led a normal life.&quot;  (Verse 25)  In a manner that has become  all too common in the last 10,000 years, by verse 33 someone has gone to  the temple and declared, &quot;If you do not hand Judas over to me as  prisoner, I will raze this sanctuary of God to the ground, I will demolish  the altar, and on this very spot I will erect a splendid temple to  Dionysus.&quot;	2000-07-12

I bought this book as a political act, if an attempt to relate on a personal level can be considered political.  I was living in Minneapolis at the time and went to a major chain bookstore in the city of Saint Paul to  order it, in a reversal of my usual (new wave vs. old hat) stereotypes of  those two cities.  If anyone considers the cover too shocking to reveal to  internet shoppers, be glad that the back cover is not what is shown.  Most  of the book is about male sexual objects, and the back cover has male  thighs forming a V with no attempt to hide what Rilke called  &quot;manhood's crest&quot; in a famous poem about an archaic torso of  Apollo.  (The poem appears in 20 German Poets, translated by Walter  Kaufmann,  p. 221.)  Plate 33 in Andy's &quot;Paintings of the 1970s&quot;  has six repetitions of what appears to me to be the display of a fist as a  sexual object, given its proximity to what is typical in this book.  What  helped me most to gain my appreciation for the contents of this book was  the text at the beginning, which begins with a direct Andy Warhol  quotation, &quot;Sex is So Abstract.&quot;  Some of the information in the  text is extracted from a book by Bob Colacello called &quot;Holy Terror:  Andy Warhol Close-Up.&quot;  On the actual quality of the artwork, the text  says, &quot;His secret is his profound and enduring aestheticism, . . .  burning with a hard, gemlike flame, but veiling this taste in a cool,  laconic front of Coke bottles, soup cans,&quot; and the bodies in this  book.  The final page of text before the drawings explains Warhol's use of  fingerpainting on Polaroid photographs, which appear to me on Plates 44,  45, and 46 to be the artist's way of searching for erogenous zones.  On a  political level, Jane Fonda must have thought that F.T.A. shows would be  entertaining, as well as conveying a particular message about militaristic  thinking.  Whoever thought of calling those shows &quot;F.T.A.&quot; must  have realized thatthe best communication involves some form of ecstatic  flow, which gives people something somewhere between what people are used  to and what they would really desire.  Art stands up under this kind of  scrutiny, while politics might mean getting involved with the kind of  people who would like to treat it as unmentionable.  This book seems to be  about art, but writing helpful reviews may involve a lot more politics than  shoppers would want to know.  Don't let me tell you where this book doesn't  belong.	2000-06-10

What is absolutely lacking today is any evidence for the  truth of the final line of that poem, &quot;For reading Milton's wit we  perish too.&quot;  (p. 295)  In these days, it is far more likely that the  TV news and entertainment will be competing for most of the attention  devoted to whoever is being more fatal.	2000-06-09

The fact that nearly two million  civilians were rejected on psychological grounds was proclaimed as proof of  a growing mental illness in the United States.&quot;  (p. 265)  Something  like a paradox appears in the diary of a young American psychiatrist,  Winfred Overholser, who later became part of the Psychological Division of  the Office of Strategic Services, but when nukes were just a remote  possibility.  When he had the opportunity to treat psychoneurotics in  France during World War I, he wrote, &quot;Time is on our side and some of  the patients get well in spite of us.&quot;  (p. 263)  For people who would  prefer a different slant on what was going on, a biographical sketch on  Winfred Overholser may be found in the Sept.-Oct. 1949 issue of &quot;The  American Journal of Occupational Therapy.&quot;  In my poor understanding  of German words, I think the doctor's name means too wooden.  If this makes  anyone think of how often Charlie Brown was considered a blockhead, maybe  Peanuts fans would enjoy this book.	2000-06-09

Books	4	1	2	N	N	Surprisingly Funny	I thought that the best thing in this book was a story about an ancient Greek painter named Zeuxis.  Back before photography, painters put a lot of effort into trying to capture reality in a picture, which might not sound too hard until you find out that for a guy like Zeuxis, &quot;the situation  seemed so ridiculous that he burst into laughter.  And he laughed so hard  that he died.&quot;  (p. 8)  The amazing thing for me is that anyone who  had so much talent could live to be 61, which is the setting that is used  for Rembrandt to be the narrator of this book:  &quot;Zeuxis ~ he was as  old as I am, sixty-one.&quot;  The dates on pages 55-57 reveal that  Rembrandt lived to be 63.  Most of the information in this book is about  his art.	2000-06-09

But I'm more of a modern fragmentist~thinking through  expectations is a realm of impossibilities, and not just for me.  I had  previously struggled with his TOTALITY AND INFINITY, which pits the urge to  control multiplicty by having a system that defines a totality against the  limitless possibilities offered by multiplicity itself.  A reader may find  that effort like a good game of chess: being able to visualize a strategy  for winning keeps the sense of involvement high, but any attempt to be more  involved than Levinas would obviously be a strain.  When ALTERITY &amp;  TRANSCENDENCE becomes available in paperback, it might be a better guide  for those who would like to see what values Levinas was pursuing.  I could  confine myself to a single page (177) in an interview published in 1985 for  my efforts to comprehend the complexity of his answer to the idea, &quot;To  religion would belong the task of consolation, not of demonstration.&quot;   Levinas took the opportunity to demonstrate the existence of an even  greater evil.  &quot;The seducer knows all the ploys of language and all  its ambiguities. . . . The most dangerous of seducers is the one who  carries you away with pious words to violence and contempt for the other  man.&quot;  Instead of trying to create a clear distinction between  religion and philosophy, Levinas showed an awareness of the ways of this  world, where any dialectic is capable of being a threat to human freedom  when it declares war on that for which it expresses disapproval.  This is  theology when it involves &quot;the voice and 'accent' of God in the  Scriptures themselves.&quot;  As a modern fragmentist, I have hopelessly  confused what is actually written there, but that tendency is as strong asthe urge to associate The Beach Boys with songs about surfing.	2000-06-08

The first step is the realization of how big this problem looms in the history of the world.  The approach taken by Isaiah  Berlin is a combination of history, philosophy, and literature.  The most  famous chapter of this book, &quot;The Hedgehog and the Fox,&quot; examines  the falsifications used in WAR AND PEACE to belittle what is usually  considered historical in order to prove what Tolstoy believed about real  complexity.  Some knowledge of calculus (college-level mathematics) might  be helpful to get the overall picture.  &quot;Our ignorance of how things  happen is not due to some inherent inaccessibility of the first causes,  only to their multiplicity, the smallness of the ultimate units, and our  own inability to see and hear and remember and record and coordinate enough  of the available material.&quot;  (pp. 44-45)  The ludicrous embrace of a  doctrine like communism was doomed as soon as communism became an enemy of  the multiplicity involved in actually getting anything done in a reasonable  way, but the people involved needed an ideology to convince them that they  had a system for generating nuclear power at Chernobyl, for example.  That  example is the best, at the moment, for showing how right Tolstoy could be  at times.  More recent efforts to make Russia function as a free  marketplace have demonstrated a danger to which any notion that might be  used as an attempt to free a people who don't know the first thing about  doing things right could fall prey.  All in all, I would rather read this  book, as difficult as it is, than be the president of Russia or worse, a  newspaper reporter there.	2000-06-04

The Pilgrimage of Psychotherapy Patients	Books	3	4	54	N	N	A Good Introduction	This book has the best title for a general work on therapy.  However, I would consider most of the advice which this contains quite conventional.  Even the chapter on a power trip does not embrace thermonuclear war.  The  advice suggested by the title might be best for someone who wished to  devote his life to writing the most unpopular reviews, or whatever other  perverse activities might suggest themselves to those who are familiar with  the Buddha.  This might be a great opportunity for irony, which ought to  pop into the mind of anyone who does not like the title upon reading it for  the first time.  A little experience in dialectics ought to allow readers  to see how this can't be the final word, whatever &quot;this&quot; is.  The  humor which I see in the title springs from my ability to show how therapy  could be the worst alternative to be suggested by those who expect everyone  to contribute positive ideas when confronting a radical situation.  Page 4  of this book, on the &quot;distress and disruption&quot; in the lives of  those who seek this kind of help, supposes that really the patient  &quot;prefers the security of known misery to the misery of unfamiliar  security.&quot;  This kind of assumption has very little play in a comic  society in which trouble is often the result of a ludicrous embrace of  inappropriate familiarity, often expressed in a manner which is considered  &quot;adult&quot; when the need to exclude children from the consideration  of such pernicious ideas is paramount.  In the suggested reading at the end  of this book, an anthology of writings by C.G. Jung is suggested.  This  kind of psychology could be associated with those who might laugh if I  claimed that I am a Freudian.  Well they might think that Freud is a Buddha  which met a collectively imposed intellectual death at some point in their  own enlightenment, but I keep hearing expletives (which ought to be  deleted) that spring from awareness of things which Freud could merely hint  at in his work on the tendencies of wit.  People who seek a little  satisfaction in themselves might find some edification in the mental  exercises suggested by this book.  But expecting this kind of thing to  change the nature of the relationship between a person and the world may  lead to some other surprise.  There was a good man in the Bible named Job,  of whom this book says, &quot;Though Job started out as an innocent, . . .  he ended up being a pest.&quot;  (p. 136)  A bit of reality might associate  that problem which Job had most closely with Job's lines quoted on the same  page, &quot;For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread  befalls me.&quot;  Job was a great book.	2000-06-03

Philosophically, the Chernobylization of thought ought to be  associated most closely with the idea that long tubes called &quot;control  rods&quot; might actually control the activity of the neutrons, whose  activity might surge quite rapidly compared to the reaction times of the  big dumb human beings who were trying to slow them down by inserting  control rods into a core which had already suffered local deformations  which prevented entry precisely at the points in the reactor where the  neutrons were able to maintain high speed.  Describing the event on 26  April 1986 as an explosion and fires, as is typical of the inadequate  vocabulary used by the kind of people who never discovered neutrons until  1932, is so human in its perspective of this event that it raises questions  about how such people could ever understand the incredible speed at which  nuclear reactions occur when the opportunity presents itself to the  materials which react when conditions are right for them.  If people had  figured out what was going to happen before trying this kind of secret  circus stunt, this book would have no reason to report that &quot;world  perception, both lay and scientific, of nuclear possibilities has been  ineradicably altered.&quot;  (p. 8)	2000-06-02

Instead, this is the work of  an expert in the law's use of the death penalty, a measure which ought to  be reserved for those cases in which something evil needs to be eradicated,  as the Unabomber seemed to be successful on a few occasions in which he  picked his own targets and used our customary methods of communication to  deliver his bombs.  What is most offensive to me is a presumption that  there is any innocence here, a legal fiction which is often used as a  professional matter to keep anyone who has formed an opinion from speaking  about things which are obvious to those who are not engaged in the drama  which conswists mainly of pretending that no one knows what is going on.   There is still a little doubt in my mind that Ted was absolutely sincere in  pleading guilty to what he did, but after he managed that bit of  confession, it is great that a law professor like Michael Mello could write  this book to show how the attempt to defend him was even crazier than he  was.	2000-06-02

On page 320 I find &quot;A permanent threat of imprisonment in France hung over his  head. . . . In the process Voltaire virtually invented the idea of public  opinion and demonstrated how it could be marshalled for a good cause.   Instead of arguing from a high plane as the other eighteenth-century  philosophers habitually did, he came down to the realities of human  life.&quot;  This book is not a pretty picture.  Philosophically, this book  demonstrates a Chernobylization of ideas which would overwhelm any power  plant employee who was assigned the job of counting the number of neutrons  in a reactor core on the exceedingly slow time frame of second by second.   The confusion which is closely associated with the point at which the  person who ought to do this job loses track of the count when things speed  up might be compared to the first paragraph of the chapter which starts on  page 318, in which public opinion is associated with the ideas usually  related to those in authority.  &quot;Stranger still, when faced by public  needs, problems or crises, we have a tendency to expect the almost  instantaneous appearance of leaders who are appropriate to the  situation.&quot;  In fact, controlling neutrons is easiest for people who  already know how utterly feckless such attempts would be in the second when  neutrons are given the opportunity to behave freely in great surges.   People who are interested in the kind of dirty tricks employed by the  secret circus that keeps this kind of thing happening ought to enjoy this  book.	2000-06-02

A controversy on which David Friedrich Strauss dared to express a strong personal opinion as a direct challenge to religious doctrine might easily be imagined by religious readers of this book.  Those who chose to defend Strauss during his lifetime as a scholar who rightly reflected the thought of their day merely fall into a pattern that had already been described in scripture.  Since the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden was from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the only surprising thing is that Strauss could get onto so much trouble on an issue which was obviously just theological, if having an end of the world as a day of judgment is merely a religious issue.  I might be confused, but a close look at his method of writing reveals a scholarly intent to examine various views that have already been expressly condemned in the scripture. In his search for a scoffer already condemned in 2 Peter iii. 3 f., Strauss referred to &quot;the Wolfenbuttel Fragmentist. No promise thoughout the whole scriptures, he thinks, is on the one hand more definitely expressed, and on the other, has turned out more flagrantly false, than this,&quot; that anything is ever subject to judgment. Annotations to the Text on Section 115 observe, &quot;Here we may observe an interesting contrast between Strauss and Reimarus (the Fragmentist).&quot; The contrast that is noted involves a close reading of the first paragraph of Section 116, in which Strauss supposes that Jesus himself expected to do as his apostles said he would: &quot;it follows that in this particular he was mistaken.&quot; The terrible error of the scoffers condemned here is their belief that &quot;all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.&quot; The irony which is usually lost in the discussion of these issues is that those who expect the world to become any more modern in its approach to this kind of problem are the most likely to be disappointed at what happens next.

For Jaspers, an interest in Nietzsche is mainly meaningful if it is  accompanied by a wish for intellectual growth (this may be a valid career  goal for those who are lucky enough to pursue this kind of thing  professionally).  At least, such a view of Jaspers could be supported by  what he wrote on the topic, &quot;Ways of Criticizing Nietzsche&quot; in  this book.  Anyone who does not accept and assume the full multiplicity of  the topic being considered falls into the error described on page 420.   &quot;He is bound to consider as fixed and final formulae what to Nietzsche  were only steps and to pervert these formulae by turning them into jargon,  demogogic means of persuasion, or sensationalistic journalese.&quot;  The  world which offered Nietzsche such foolish models for demonstrating the  recklessness of typical thinking does not receive due consideration here,  this being a book on a lonely thinker.  The self of Nietzsche can only  emerge for readers who are able &quot;to keep this depth in sight&quot;  while overcoming &quot;the rationally onesided formulations of the  understanding which he himself recognized in his own thinking but failed to  check.&quot;  Such a view of Nietzsche springs from the desire of those who  need to consider themselves fully educated, but sensible.  The kind of  thought-check which is being suggested by Jaspers is supposed to thwart the  kind of racing thoughts which are not productive.  Don't forget that Karl  Jaspers was also a doctor, an expert on General Psychopathology, a field in  which facts are not as important as the emotional experiences of the kind  of person who becomes the subject of such studies.  In the field of  philosophy, where Nietzsche's desire to learn the truth about the  limitations which always prevent the full realization of this desire for  truth, thereby setting a new standard for intellectual integrity, Jaspers  felt that Nietzsche's sense of &quot;knowing full well where to find  exactly what I have to learn&quot; (p. 421) when it came to matters fully  covered by books &quot;was of little consequence for his truly  philosophical thinking.&quot;  (p. 421)  I must be over-simplifying this ~  this is only a review, and Jaspers's sympathy with Nietzsche's awareness of  the limitations placed on his knowledge by the fact that &quot;he was  forced to content himself with the reading of books&quot; (p. 421) must be  true as well for people who are only reading reviews.	2000-05-27

In his discussion of the final topic in this book, a note which Nietzsche wrote  that said, &quot;I have forgotten my umbrella,&quot; he openly expresses  his philosophical doubt about its significance with what must be considered  his standard stance, &quot;The meaning and the signature that appropriates  it remain in principle inaccessible.&quot;  (p. 125)  Offering an  interpretation is like guessing what Nietzsche's umbrella might have been  metaphorically, as one might consider the significance of religion, social  thought, conscience, or morality as it relates to a person's place in the  world.  The interest in Derrida's examination of Nietzsche's style,  &quot;Hence the heterogeneity of the text,&quot; (p. 95) seems to be  greatest in the consideration of alternative positions which Nietzsche  offers regarding women, truth, etc.  &quot;It is not that it is necessary  to choose sides with the heterogeneous or the parody (which would only  reduce them once again).  Nor, given that the master sense, the sole  inviolate sense, is irretrievable, does it necessarily follow that  Nietzsche's mastery is infinite, his power impregnable, or his manipulation  of the snare impeccable.&quot;  (p. 99)  This stuff is only obvious to  those whose ludicrous embrace of comic material does not exceed their grasp  of what a comic society consists of, the fools that mortals be.

At this meeting the president not only confirmed the decision that sent the Maddox back into the Gulf of Tonkin along with the Turner Joy, he authorized the continuation of OPLAN 34A raids (definitely the one scheduled for the night of August 3-4, and perhaps also those for the night of August 4-5; the procedure of waiting for the results of each raid to be evaluated, before approval of the next was initiated . . . would not have been practiced when there were to be raids on consecutive nights).\\"  (pp. 103-4).<br />The amount of detail in this book could support a view that secret operations are those things which are not revealed in order to create the greatest spin in the direction of the psychological warfare advantage desired by whoever is keeping the secrets. To get a full appreciation of the kind of restraint which the American government displayed in this incident, the whole picture should be compared to how well the participants in World War II responded to the order given by the president in August, 1945 (a mere 19 years before the Tonkin incident) not to drop any more atomic bombs on people whose government exhibited any hostility toward military activities directed by the United States of America. President Truman's order was followed by massive conventional bombing, much as the history of American bombing in Vietnam shows how long a superpower can maintain a campaign of destruction against anyone who knows the truthabout something which is supposed to be secret. This book shows great deference to the feelings of the anonymous secret operations experts who would never say anything that wasn't in the best interests of the powers that be. \\"Escalation\\" is an understatement for the overt actions taken against North Vietnam in August, 1964. Adopting a bombing routine as a conditioned response to false accusations in anticipation of making the bombing a regular routine, in the absence of any debate on why things happened as they did, was the real policy. Even now, most people who ought to know better are pretending that a lot of things revealed in this book are still secret. What people don't believe now is the preamble to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which stated that the United States was going to be maintaining peace there, where it had no territoreal, military, or political ambitions. My ambition was to get the Combat Infantryman's Badge without getting killed, so I could be the CIB who failed to agree with whoever thought this ought to be. Check the facts in this book for a truly tortured bit of not being able to see a forest because the treehouse doesn't have any windows, and the trap door in the floor is closed.	2000-05-26

The Acknowledgments on p. xv includes a comment on &quot;My dissertation research in  Paris.&quot;  My use of the term &quot;modern&quot; in my reviews conforms  to the sense which I observe on page 79 of this book.  A cartoon at the top  of the page, called &quot;M. Manet studying beautiful nature,&quot; dated  April 25, 1880, is followed by an explanation which &quot;connects the  extremity of exposed breasts to vulgarity and ugliness . . . by mocking any  connection between this toilette and decorous feminine beauty.&quot;  The  painting which is then discussed, Henri Gervex's &quot;Rolla,&quot; was  abruptly removed from the Salon of 1878 for impropriety, but was exhibited  by a private dealer for three months.  Consideration of that painting in  this book begins with &quot;Another instance of a painting that displays  female sexuality as something of a threat, and that locates this threat  specifically in the realm of modern fashion.&quot;  (p. 79)  The painting  was based on a poem by Alfred de Musset about a son of the bourgeoisie who  squandered his fortune and committed suicide at the age of nineteen.  The  details of the painting are discussed to such an extent that minor elements  of the picture become a great danger.  &quot;Indeed the lack of restraint  that Gervex showed in placing the cain in the still life points to the  vulnerability of the genre of the nude, to the ways in which the nude was  almost always a strained synthesis of opposing forces, perpetually in  danger of slipping out of equilibrium as a consequence of even the smallest  push in the direction of deviance.&quot;  (p.88)  The discussion of that  painting concludes with &quot;Rolla drowned in the rising tide of sexual  vice.  The woman was the culprit, and Rolla her victim.&quot;  (p. 93)   Chapter Four's topic is &quot;Suspicious Professions&quot; and featurespictures of working women, the intrigue being tied closely to the question,  what makes them so cute?	2000-05-25

Understanding the nature of deep empathy seems easiest to me in the 1947 work, &quot;Van Gogh, the Man Suicided by Society&quot; on pages 481  to 512.  Artaud only lived from 1896 to 1948, but he seemed to be strangely  affected by the coronation of Heliogabalus which began in the year 217.   Artaud was not reading the history of events lightly when he reported  &quot;that the historians begin to go mad with rage.&quot;  (p.317)  Artaud  was on the side of the emperor who picked his victims from among the  aristocrats in &quot;a kind of superior anarchy&quot; which &quot;runs from  jewel to jewel, from outburst to outburst, from form to form, and from  flame to flame, as if he were running from soul to soul in a mysterious  interior odyssey which no one after him ever repeated.&quot;  (p. 329)   Strangely enough, this seems very modern to me, approaching what is now  considered the height of entertainment.	2000-05-24

The list of  Contents at the beginning shows 33 topics to be covered in its 313 pages,  each drawn from a variety of texts, illustrating Mao's use of the concepts  in his actual political practice.  Somebody thought that everybody in China  should know this stuff in order to conform to a system of thought which  would allow them all to dare to struggle and dare to win.  Topic 6,  starting on page 72, is called &quot;Imperialism and all Reactionaries are  Paper Tigers.&quot;  About two years after the Soviet weapons program  dropped the first hydrogen bomb to be tested from an airplane (it worked),  Mao said, &quot;U.S. imperialism has not yet been overthrown and it has the  atom bomb.  I believe it will also be overthrown.  It, too, is a paper  tiger.&quot;  (p. 75)  My bet is on the paper tigers, and as long as anyone  still thinks that imperialism could be overthrown, thousands of  thermonuclear weapons are sure to dominate the picture.  So people will  know, we are not just paper tigers.  Even David Koresh, who dared to preach  in a church called Mount Carmel, ought to realize now that deep down we are  nukers.	2000-05-23

Kunstler: The Most Hated Lawyer in America	Books	4	2	7	N	N	Smart Enough to be Funny	Stand-up comedy is not in the index of this book, but it gets mentioned.  Along with a list of Kunstler's film credits is a note that when he tried a comedy routine, he got his biggest laugh for a lawyer joke.  I was  interested, a long time ago, in what Chapter 6 of this book calls Circus in  Chicago.  Back when I was contemplating what I might like to do in a career  in law, I would have enjoyed the opportunity to generate the number of  laughs that are contained in this book.  Then I actually found a case that  said &quot;Resort to the courts is futile.&quot;  That was such a change  from my expectations that an element of humor creeps into my appreciation  of the outrageous nature of that truth.  As evidence that the author of  this book is aware of the potent nature of that form of humor, picture  this:  &quot;Kunstler objected.  The United States attorney jumped up and  argued, 'This is outrageous.  This man [Kunstler] is the mouthpiece for  these defendants.  The Government protests this man's attitude.'&quot;  (p.  124)  I thought that the best legal point in the book was that Bobby Seale  could not be retried on the conspiracy charge after the jury found that the  other seven defendants were not guilty of conspiracy.  Seale hadn't been  charged with anything else, so further proceedings in his case would have  been pointless.  If there is a fine line between legal logic and the quirks  of the system, check this book for the side of the line where the quirks  are, and maybe you have already seen bits and pieces of this story on TV.   It sure made the newpapers when it was going on.	2000-05-22

Something of the spirit of that time may be indicated by the final comment  on the back flap (which might not be the same now, as then):  &quot;THE  LIFE OF GREECE may well take its place as the most brilliant story of a  magnificently endowed people whose career ended in tragedy and unwanted  assimilation because they discovered a world view too late.&quot;  Since  this book was written, others have tried to create more complicated views  of the problems involved in tragedy, history, philosophy, and fate, but  much knowledge can be accounted for by the spurious needs of a superpower  seeking an alternative to the lessons which this book clearly illustrates  in its consideration of Euripides as a philosopher and an exile.  Euripides  is most famous for his plays, and Durant informs us that at one  performance, &quot;the crowd protested so loudly against what seemed to be  an outrageously immoral proposition that Euripides had to rise in his seat  and comfort them with the assurance that Hippolytus would suffer edifyingly  before the story closed ~ a safe promise for almost any character in Greek  tragedy.&quot;  (p. 417)  I couldn't find anything about impeachment in the  index, but Durant has two versions of the end of Euripides' life.  &quot;At  Pella, under the protection of this Frederick ~ who had no fears for the  orthodoxy of his people ~ Euripides found peace and comfort. . . . Eighteen  months after his arrival he died, attacked and dismembered, said pious  Greeks, by the royal hounds.&quot;  (p. 418)	2000-05-21

When she passed  through New York in the fall, same story.&quot;  On a personal level, this  is a complaint by someone of immense popularity that her own views on the  war wouldn't sell, or weren't being sold.  The highest irony of this book  is its final sentence, at the end of a review of a very explicit book by  David Halberstam, &quot;In career terms, which in my view interest  Halberstam excessively, how dead is 'dead'?&quot;  Please be assured that I  feel the same way whenever a representative of my government calls me and  asks where I am working, and then wonders why I would mention Richard  Nixon.  I only mention this book the way dubious achievements might be  associated with Nixon and the question, &quot;Why is this dead man  laughing?&quot;  I promise that this book is easier to understand than the  death of Homer, a famous Greek poet who was so blind he couldn't tell what  two boys were doing when they said, &quot;That which we see and catch, we  leave behind, but what we neither see nor catch, we carry with us.&quot;   McCarthy mentions Homer on page 235 to support the idea that &quot;at the  front, war itself appears senseless, a confused butchery that only the gods  can understand.&quot;  On page 268, she is more explicitly into Homeric  epithets, comparing his use of the godly phrase &quot;cloud-gathering  Zeus&quot; to &quot;the air pirates,&quot; (one of &quot;the set phrases of  North Vietnamese diction.&quot;)  Never again should we try to go to war  without our Homer, whoever that might be.  My vote for the Homer of Nam  would be Bernard Fall, a smiling fellow in the picture of the author on the  back of the jacket for this book.  The picture might be more famous than  the book.  The caption under the picture says, &quot;Mary McCarthy in  Vietnam with Bernard Fall, February, 1967 (Fall was killed under fire  shortly afterward.)  Newsweek, Francoise Sully copyright 1967.&quot;  It is  a bit late to read this book now, but the calculation of the number of  people who haven't read this book can only go one way, up, and it is going  to do that forever, as sure as Homer is dead.	2000-05-21

American interest in the story which Halberstam  tells in this book will always be greater than anything that Mary McCarthy  might tell us about what any of the Vietnamese thought.  For me this book  was my first glimpse at the explicit nature of the thinking at the top,  which definitely trickled down to the Americans out in the field in  Vietnam, though none of them may have used it in the presence of a great  American novelist like Mary McCarthy, who possessed an elite, upper-crust  quality which made her defense of her own thinking on the topic as easy to  dismiss as the superfluous usually are.  Like a perverse philosopher  viewing the comedy of mayhem, she would like to know &quot;to what end all  these excited words were assembled, . . . studded, like a ham, with  anecdotes and gossip about historic decisions and high-status  personalities, syrupy with compassionate insights into the gamesmanship of  power?&quot;  That would be like asking why I review books, and  particularly, this one.	2000-05-21

My own interest in reviews is becoming as intense as the  analysis of the personal correspondence of all the people mentioned in this  book. (Fourth Edition.)  My copy was printed in 1974, and current buyers  should be able to find a letter which Nietzsche wrote in mid-December  (1882?) on page 58 to his closest friends, &quot;It is much harder to  forgive one's friends than one's enemies.&quot;  Did I mention that three  people, all of them authors, and &quot;an immense dose of opium,&quot; not  to mention the possibility that &quot;I should accidentally take my life  some day,&quot; were involved in this little scene?  My strangest defense  for bringing this up is that I was interested in this book's treatment of  Paul Ree as a representative of an English attitude toward morality which I  first found shocking when I discovered it in poems by William Blake, but  which might be assumed to be the intellectual realm of Satan in the great  poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; by John Milton.  Blake and Milton ought to  be considered representative of intellectual creativity which, when it  comes to morality, is not bounded by common sense.  In the real world,  anyone who would have to act as a parent might say, &quot;I say this  flatly,&quot; and would expect to be understood.  What is more famous, in  the case of Nietzsche, Ree, and Lou, is the idea of a 'wild marriage.'   Nietzsche and Ree had met in Basel in 1873, and &quot;a genuine friendship  developed that lasted seven years&quot; (p. 48) after Nietzsche wrote to  Ree on October 22, 1875 on Ree's book of psychological observations, which  had just been published.  Perhaps Ree was grateful that Nietzsche seemed to  be granting him more sympathy than pity.  This book, Kaufmann's biography  of Nietzsche, reveals that Ree even wrote twenty letters to Nietzsche's  sister and twelve to Nietzsche's mother.  Hello?  This public display of  private matters might be more incredible now than writing book reviews for  internet shoppers, or it might be the measure by which the future will  determine how modern the twentieth century was in its examination of this  kind of material.	2000-05-21

I bought it because sometimes it  might be better than the encyclopedia which was a family purchase when my  children were in elementary school.  The point may be that the knowledge  which it presents attempts to limit itself to those things which experts in  a field might agree with, instead of the kind of sweeping generalizations  which the modern media have made the standard of pseudo-intellectual views  commonly available to the point of intellectual asphyxiation.  This book  does not express an opinion directly on psychotic multiplicity, but there  is an entry written by D. J. Enright, a poet, novelist, critic, editor, and  publisher on &quot;dissociation of sensibility&quot; as the concept was  used by T. S. Eliot in an essay, &quot;The Metaphysical Poets.&quot;   (1921)  It applied to examples from Donne and Milton in which thinking and  feeling were split, but success in this realm of thought is now deemed not  to be &quot;as precise in its effects as a lobotomy.  The truth is that  dissociation of sensibility has always been with us, and that unification  of sensibility is a rare phenomenon, not always possible and perhaps not  always called for.&quot;  (p. 177)  Don't expect this work to be a  best-seller.  This kind of thing is necessary only for those who need to  know such wisdom as it contains.	2000-05-21

Rank considered it a component of  &quot;head-culture, . . . saturated with the scientific ideology&quot;  associated with &quot;the egocentric outlook which produced the  competitiveness and quarrelsomeness of the various Greek tribes, cities,  and heroes that is evidenced even in the Trojan War stories.&quot;  My  knowledge of the history of American psychiatry clings to the memory of the  minor role played by Harry Stack Sullivan in establishing the professional  ethics that kept Otto Rank from treating his patients as a psychiatrist  because he wasn't a doctor.  While some memory of artistic character  development clings to people's emotional problems, medical practice in the  mental health field makes this book almost irrelevant to modern treatment  of these problems, and I only mention it to show what fools we would prefer  to be as a society dedicated to the suppression of all uncommercial efforts  in the area of art, which remains a highly suspect activity, subject to  ritual condemnations by the critics in the press who can't print what the  artist is thinking.  For people who don't expect to read this book, I would  recommend the movie &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot; as a study in character  of the wanna-be kind of people which a culture that celebrates art and  drama produces.	2000-05-20

Van Goth has become the most famous painter for expressing the agony  of the unrecognized artist, willing to die to save his brother the terrible  expense of having too many mouths to feed, but Egon Schiele suffered arrest  and had one of his drawings burned in open court because the judge knew  what it was a picture of.  While the number of Van Goth paintings may have  increased due to an influx of fakes after Van Goth's death, actual drawings  by Egon Schiele may have been destroyed long ago because they were deemed  pornographic.

A few of Melville's  other works have come to my attention at several points in my life, and I  am glad to see that these items are included in this selection.  On a topic  which remains a familiar concern for me, &quot;that prolonged agony of  continual war,&quot; (p. 637) I suggest reading the story &quot;Billy Budd,  Foretopman&quot; as a model for what can be expected in the war on drugs.   Anything might be considered more important if it can be rightly compared  to a story with a first sentence which, as it says, &quot;belongs to a  period which, as every thinker now feels, involved a crisis for Christendom  not exceeded in its undetermined momentousness at the time by any other era  whereof there is record.&quot;  (p. 637)  I had to buy this book because it  contains the story &quot;Bartleby.&quot;  The relentless element in the  story is the phrase &quot;I would prefer not to,&quot; surprisingly used by  a scrivener when he was requested to do something which seemed perfectly  reasonable to the rest of the world.  The level of the philosophical  questions raised by this strange behavior, &quot;What do you mean?  Are you  moon-struck?&quot; (p. 476) bring about a strange admission: &quot;Had  there been the least uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his  manner; in other words, had there been anything ordinarily human about him,  doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises.&quot;   (p. 477)  This might not make a very exciting movie, but I suggest it as a  guide to real life.	2000-05-19

I have a few books which discuss Ariadne, the subject of Chapter One. The graphics by Edvard Munch seemed well selected. I liked \\"Woman\\" and \\"Madonna\\" (both from 1895), but the woodcut on page 52 seemed peculiar: trying to place a Nietzsche-figure in the central position, strangely supporting the subject matter. I like the first page of Chapter Two for including a sentence by Nietzsche which draws \\"the duplicity of the Apollinian and the Dionysian\\" into similarity with \\"the duality of the sexes.\\" (p. 33). Puzzles like this have become a major part of modern educational orientation, but the approach presented here seems to be a long way from the mainstream. As the preface admits, \\"The book gathers together some perplexing and rarely discussed materials from Nietzsche's literary remains and comments briefly on them.\\" (p. ix) Bits of Nietzsche's published works are traced to the creative use of ideas in different settings, as some were to be used for Zarathustra's death in \\"Nietzsche's unpublished sketches\\" similar to \\"the sundry postponements of Zarathustra's death within Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\\" (p. 53) The scholarly treatment of this subject is unrelenting, even if it is short and precise.<br />The book has an index, which lists 19 individual pages for Empedocles, plus 40-50 passim.  In Nietzsche's notebooks of 1870-71, while Nietzsche was still a young professor, he was planning a drama on Empedocles in which \\"The most beautiful woman brings him a crown.\\"  (p. 45).  A few lines later, \\"At the temple of Pan.  `Great Pan is dead.' \\"  (p. 45).  The drama was intended to be tragic, like the title of this book.	2000-05-17

There is hardly any standard which might work for such great complexity.  The use of cartoons in this book hardly makes it any  less heavy than the textual approach which was philosophy's standard format  in the age of print.  So many readers have learned what they think they  know about Nietzsche from little quotes which are simpler than the contents  of the typical page in this book that it is not surprising that some people  who try learning from this book are stymied by the complexity presented  here.  By the time I bought this, I didn't expect it to increase my  knowledge of philosophy.  My first big surprise was Nietzsche thinking  &quot;With Lange I'm Made&quot; on page 22.  Lange's HISTORY OF MATERIALISM  is not a popular book now, but it had a scope and multiple editions which  made its coverage of Charles Darwin and David F. Strauss contemporaneous  with Nietzsche's own consideration of the most popular public opinion  leaders of his day.  The summaries of Lange (1828 - 1875) and Schopenhauer  (1788 - 1860) on pages 24 &amp; 25 set the context for Nietzsche's thinking  on the pretensions of materialism in a world in which &quot;to want is to  suffer.&quot;  The high point of the book for me was the imperialist threat  on page 50 and the revolutionary threat on page 52.  Those particular  problems receive a fair amount of attention in the ensuing discussion of  Nietzsche's work, and my recommendation of this book is based mainly on  that approach.  This philosophy needs these problems to overcome the  aversion of the pious.	2000-05-17

Short, this book, on THE BIBLE and Peanuts, may be expected to generate comments on religious doctrines, like my own tendency  to suggest that it suffers from single savior syndrome, as churches tend to  do.  This can go on until the Hegelian cows come home, but the fundamental  matter actually gets discussed in Chapter 9 of this book, on &quot;the  experience of a broken heart.&quot; (p. 38)  The kind of sense which Short  is trying to make comes out as an inner dialectic on precisely this point.   &quot;Indeed, it's the purifying and purging and hellish fires within the  broken heart that boil down the Bible's message into what is most essential  and necessary for us to understand for our heart's peace.&quot;  (p. 41)   For my own good, it is nice to know that a comic strip in which Lucy van  Pelt offers flawless advice for 5 cents, with &quot;THE DOCTOR IS IN&quot;  showing on the front of her neighborhood shrink booth in five of the panels  of that strip, can be seen on page 45 of this book, and helps make  psychiatric care a contender for those who need some support in order to  seem more respectable, even if her final comment is &quot;BACK ALREADY?   WHAT HAPPENED?&quot;  The effort to deal with profound matters in the  tensions of our times shows up best for me in the Notes on pages 141-2.   Note 11 shows that his quote of Oscar Wilde was from the poem, &quot;The  Ballad of Reading Goal,&quot; not a matter to be taken lightly.	2000-05-07

A previous translation, in The Portable  Nietzsche, presented the ideas here as philosophical thought: &quot;to have  spirit: one must arrogate it, one must have the arrogance to have  spirit.&quot;  (TPN, p. 505)  As a predominantly German-American nobody,  who knows how far from the ethos of our comic society such an attitude  would be, I prefer the more apologetic tone used by Hollingdale at the  beginning of his section on What the Germans Lack.  &quot;Among Germans  today it is not enough to possess spirit: one must also possess the  presumption to possess it.&quot;  (Twilight of the Idols, p. 71)  My joy is  not in any possession here, but simply in the opportunity which Nietzsche  created to raise certain issues.  &quot;I also add that here people can  still obey without being humiliated by obeying. . . . And no one despises  his adversary . . .&quot;  Perhaps Nietzsche was thinking of philosophers  like Kant when he wrote that.  A page later, Nietzsche is back to an old  complaint:  &quot;But this nation has deliberately made itself stupid, . .  . how much beer there is in the German intellect!&quot;  As a critic of  something like a culture, based on power and a common touch for everything  concerning greatness, there is much that one can find to sympathize with  Nietzsche's views today.  Such a view of this work might be in keeping with  his line, &quot;That the Germans have so much as endured their  philosophers, above all that most deformed conceptual cripple there has  ever been, the great Kant, offers a good idea of German amenableness.&quot;   (p. 77)  I suppose this is really about unconditional surrender to  whatever is considered culturally superior, but only a fool would admit it.   This comes coupled with an attack on the common form of religion.	2000-05-07

Such a world we live in~this book is the standard by which people determine what is normal, and I find that I must  be the most spaced out poet on the planet to want to render my own  judgment:<br />You and Fick~what a stitch,<br />what a stitch!<br />Psychologically  sick,<br />Intellectually rich.<br />The basis for my inappropriate laughter on  this attempt to straight-lace the most modern of presidents is the  strangeness of the thought which forms the basis for this book~suppose that  the American body politic is a woman.  The stitch which makes Fick's book  seem most unseamly on this question might be to an author, Kelly Oliver, of  a book on philosophy's relation to the &quot;feminine.&quot;  I consider  Oliver my main guide to this realm of intellectual intoxication, possibly  more reliable on the knowledge of these things than democracy has proved  suitable as a system for governing people who disagree more on who has to  follow certain rules than on anything else.  I have read one book by  Oliver, but I read it in such a way, with a deep and modernly theological  background in the world which she attempts to describe, that I might claim  to know her subject better than she does herself merely by calling  attention to a line on page 16 of her book.  &quot;Like the fetishist,  Freud has it both ways.&quot;  We are not arranging a psychological  heavyweight championship fight here, Freud to Fick, with Kelly Oliver as  the mother who tells them when to break it up because this isn't fair,  Freud was a real doctor or something.  Actually, Oliver thought, &quot;For  Freud there is nothing more frightening than the thought of being buried  alive,&quot; and he isn't likely to be by any book by Paul M. Fick.	2000-05-06

He is not just any writer, but the great  Gombrowicz here, because he is filled with a terror that is obviously being  cooked up for the world to see.  And therefore, what a vividly realized  world we see.  The difficulties involved in reading this book succeed in  making it what it is.	2000-05-03

Of these two novels, my favorite is Pornografia, which was plotted like a detective story, except that instead of trying to solve a murder which takes place in the beginning of the story, the book assumes the necessity of murder and allows the plot to revolve around the intricacies of how such  events evolve from a situation like Poland under Nazi domination.  There is  a certain danger in this book which is best illustrated by one character's  experience during the mass, when he is obviously doing what everybody else  is doing only to keep from doing anything else.  If you work in an  environment like that, you may develop a feeling that a job is a terrible  thing to have when you can only do what you are supposed to do, and you can  never do Gombrowicz.  This is an affliction like the madness of greatness,  and the easiest way to find out what it is will be by reading this book.	2000-05-03

As a comic, I would consider Peanuts much closer to  the book of Job than to the Gospels.  What I remember is a strip discussing  Job, in which Lucy complains that Job's wife doesn't get enough credit.  If  that strip is not in this book, subtract a few stars from my rating and  consider me confused by the serial process effect which is more like life  than any sure foundation offered here.  The main key to popularity in these  things is the regularity: daily comics and church once a week form a  framework that people can depend on because they fulfill expectations.  In  our comic society, split along lines of people who know the same jokes,  there may be millions of people who would think of this book if I stole the  sign from the neighborhood shrink booth, &quot;The Doctor is In&quot; as  the title for my review of General Psychopathology by Karl Jaspers, who  once wrote that his father had stopped attending church when he reached a  certain age because he had been embarrassed by too many things that had  been said there.  It takes a lifetime of withdrawal from certain addictions  to realize what people are going through now, as it may be a sad day when  people realize that I have anything to say about this book.  A little  shared intimacy can hurt a lot more than the typical joke, but the experts  spend all their time arguing about what is typical here.  Is this the end?	2000-04-29

A thorough knowledge of the point of view presented by Jaspers goes a long way in support of the view that modern drug treatments of psychiatric problems attempt to mask symptoms,  which are much easier to define and classify than the problems of existence  that attempt to surface in situations where people would like an infinite  solution to individual problems.  In Jaspers's examination of the  relationship between the doctor and the patient, any doctor who approaches  a fixed view of the best remedy is in danger of failing to understand the  nature of the individual patient.  It helps to have some background in the  personal issues which are most meaningful to the reader.  In our own time,  there is a controversy about the use of ancient remedies like marijuana,  and I found it useful to compare therapeutic suggestions in this book with  the federal government's position that smoking such stuff isn't medicine,  &quot;it's more like a Cheech and Chong show.&quot;  If you want to live  through reading this book, you will have to inhale while you read.  Best of  all, there is no point in this book at which the doctor says, &quot;Your  time is up.&quot;	2000-04-27

For some, this book  might be a guide to the intimate Nixon's selection of prefatory words, the  secret to the preparation required for Nixon's mind to deal with certain  concepts, and for trying to get his own views in, over, around, and beyond  certain ideas.  In the philosophy section, Nixon admits, &quot;once in a  while I come across something that makes sense.&quot;  (p. 353)  A lot of  this reminds me of my feelings about a job I had, where I got fired after  telling everybody, &quot;This place is too much for a Monday morning.&quot;   Another thing that Nixon and I have in common was one of his favorite  teachers, who was still teaching at a law school in September, 1968, when  the Selective Service started drafting law students.  Having a teacher like  that didn't matter as much to me as having someone tell me what to do, and  Nixon might be considered a failure in either department when he couldn't  pull off the little request made by one of his subordinates, William  Rogers, who subtly suggested a possible weakness in a strategic plan by  saying, &quot;I'm for it if it will work!&quot;  (p. 353)  Count Nixon  among those who have tried to read Hegel and fallen back to the position,  &quot;It's easier to bury everything.&quot;  (p. 353)  Being stuck on one  page like this, I might never get to Nixon's use of the word,  &quot;Beyond.&quot;  That was on page 351, on Nietzsche &quot;with regard  to the soul.&quot;  I didn't notice anything on what Nietzsche had to say  with regard to the truth.  Nietzsche and Nixon agree when they are talking  about the selfish last man.  As Nixon said, &quot;but he is pathetic.&quot;   (p. 352)	2000-04-26

Those who know the full extent of Wilde's wit ought to see how bitterly it was able to express itself, when getting locked up for enjoying  inappropriate pleasures of the mind results in this, the reflection that  &quot;every prison that men build is built with bricks of shame.&quot;  (p.  40)  Although it is included in a small book, the poem in the title might  seem to go on forever, as it hardly ends when Wilde gets to the last line,  &quot;The brave man with a sword !&quot;	2000-04-25

The way it works, &quot;Ringed with a scum of chicken-necked  bosses,&quot; hardly compares to the desires which it can't grasp.  There  is a world of reasons for every word in that poem.	2000-04-25

Toad's temper  tantrum, directed against anyone who would dare to criticize his love of  motorcars, perfectly illustrates the irresponsibility of the rich which  formed the basis for Clarence Darrow's defense of the young millionaire  kidnappers Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, Jr., in Chapter XI of this  book.  People who have been raised in an environment in which their  greatest pleasures involve not getting caught indulging in them might  wonder how anyone could be immature enough to believe that not getting  caught would be the one thing which they could count on in whatever they  did.  I believe this book explains that point better than any court  proceeding could.  Bringing in experts to talk about the lives of those who  had been expecting to con everybody by themselves is the kind of vicious  circle that close contact with the law rewarded in this case by letting the  defendants live instead of facing a decreed execution.  This reminds me of  a joke about professional courtesy, lawyers, and sharks, but what this book  makes perfectly clear is that what a great lawyer needs is clients.	2000-04-25

It incites the desire in me to shrink it down to something else, like any psychiatrist would approach a case of psychotic multiplicity.  There are a number of individuals with credible positions  presented in this book, and the summaries of those positions express  matters that are highly important.  The problem with the story is that,  instead of hinging on the things that are important, the whole picture is  in danger of becoming unhinged whenever a decision approaches the bottom  line.  This is like great art which has no conception that the whole world  might see this picture and consider it absolutely nukers.  As crazy as all  the other nukers in the world might seem to us, it takes a lot of effort to  keep from applying the same judgment to the system which inflicts the costs  mainly on ourselves.  There are things in this book, like William Greider's  comment about &quot;payoffs for layoffs&quot; on page 200, which make it  too obvious which bottom line matters.  His personal suggestion to  &quot;turn out the lights rather than waste all this money waiting for  world war three&quot; (p. 201) is coupled with his knowledge of officers  who &quot;question this choice of toys over boys&quot; (p. 202) because of  what's happening: &quot;they're being rolled by the industry.&quot;  (p.  202)  Even Wilson has to report that &quot;There are too many  fiefdoms.&quot;  (p. 202)  That might be the main conclusion here, except  that it is followed by some comment about a president who would rather  &quot;chat by the side of the road until a compromise route is agreed  upon.&quot; (p. 203)  The index doesn't have an entry for &quot;depleted  uranium&quot; weapons, but we are still planning for some part of the world  to become a dumping ground for our bombs, and it is highly unlikely that  there will be much of a chat by the side of the road before the choice of  mistakes on where we can hurt our enemies the most is made.  The story of  how &quot;the American military's fighting edge was being lost for lack of  money&quot; (p. 90) hardly makes sense in a world that keeps complaining  when we do destroy things.	2000-04-24

Some people might find certain things too frightening to believe however historically accurate an account might be, and Poe has been  charged with a number of hoaxes which presented literature in a magazine  that had pretenses of reporting on actual events.  My normal method of  study is with a concordance, so that I can see how an author uses  particular terms, and I would have no idea where to look to see if Poe ever  used the word &quot;horsefeathers.&quot;  Nevertheless, in the field of  thought which is most interesting to me, best summarized as ways of being  deadly, Poe is the American intellectual figure who towers above all the  rest.  Hardly anyone else should even dare to recite a line from an  outstanding poem, &quot;Ulalume~A Ballad&quot; which simply says, &quot;Our  talk had been serious and sober.&quot;  Poetic science begins with the  ability to find that line in this book.	2000-04-24

Take Cambodia.&quot;  If this book is incomplete in any way, it  might be in failing to appreciate how well Cambodia had reached agreement  with a Vietnamese government in Vietnam to allow supplies for a Vietnamese  army to be imported through the major port in Cambodia.  There might be  something in the book about how little the CIA knew about this arrangement  until the dock records established what was going on thirty years ago.   Another possibility is that the CIA was so enraged about how this worked  that it wouldn't even admit that it knew that certain Vietnamese were as  welcome in Cambodia as American troops were in Vietnam.  This book may  perpetuate some myth that Cambodia was a demilitarized zone which was  violated by an American invasion.  Closer to the truth is the possibility  that Cambodia was unstable because American interests could be served by  promoting utter devastation right where it existed.  My favorite mob in  Cambodia knew that Lon Nol had a brother named Lon Nil, who is listed in  the index of this book.  Lon Nil had a liver.  I also have a book called 20  German Poets, selected, translated, and introduced by Walter Kaufmann.  The  first poem in the book, by Germany's first worldly historical poet, Goethe,  is called &quot;Prometheus.&quot;  The second verse of that poem,  translated into English on page 9, feeds a certain realization.   &quot;Wretchedly you nourish your majesty on sacrificial tolls and flimsy  prayers, and would starve if children and beggars were not hopeful  fools.&quot;  If you don't like that, you won't like this book.	2000-04-21

The most obvious joke, whenever something might make the people of a truly great  country feel guilty, couldn't be left unsaid until some person had the  nerve to show how a comedian would have come right out and said it.  Living  in a comic society, full of celebrities with a reputation for having great  feelings, the ultimate intellectual should also be capable of illustrating  the guilt felt by everybody and his brother, when observing the behavior  exhibited by an obviously tricky character.  But anyone who actually took a  part in grabbing the media and beating it might find that this practice is  habit-forming, as any profession is in danger of becoming a habit after  awhile.  The other topic of this book is the sanctity of human life, but  the story is really much too political for that.  I have a tendency to  laugh, and the last laugh might belong to those who can still remember how  many years have gone by since we read this book.	2000-04-19

It involves internal hysteria about matters which ordinary people are supposed to avoid in a way which Heidegger called the &quot;often practiced procedure&quot; of taking Nietzsche's revelations &quot;as the harbinger of erupting  madness.&quot;  (p. 3)  What Heidegger contributes to the psychotic  multiplicity is the recognition that Nietzsche's thought illustrates a  particular philosophy.  As the first paragraph of this book puts it,  &quot;Nietzsche is that thinker who trod the path of thought to 'the will  to power.'&quot;  By the next page, Heidegger turns away from individual  matters to what he feels, in the agony of our times, to be really  philosophical issues.  &quot;Neither the person of Nietzsche nor even his  work concern us when we make both in their connection the object of a  historiological and psychological report.&quot;  (p. 4)  This is not simple  reporting: people tend to think most deeply about whatever they find most  troubling.  Nietzsche could relate this kind of thing to the bite of a dog  on a stone.  Nothing is yielding here.  Objections which suggest themselves  to anyone who tries to observe this effort might best be directed  elsewhere, but in the realm of philosophy, this is the best example of the  notion that science is a sacred cow.  A full understanding of the mental  effort involved in this exercise might be closer to stripping away any  individual's defenses than to the kind of herd instinct of those parties  whose imperviousness to thought is typical of what a political philosophy  would normally represent.  This is not an effort to produce a sacred cow.   This is an attempt to penetrate the heart of secret sacred cowsville.	2000-04-18

While November of 1965 might not be of much importance for most people, it was particularly troubling for the Secretary of Defense.  This book puts that  time in Chapter 17, called &quot;Two Enormous Miscalculations.&quot;  The  most unexpected event on November 2 was the death of &quot;a  thirty-one-year-old Quaker pacifist&quot; named Norman Morrison, who had  &quot;drenched himself in kerosene and burned himself to death&quot; in  &quot;the parking lot below the window of McNamara's office to send a  message to him.&quot;  (p. 354)  The calculations of the chapter were  military: setting how many American troops would be sent to Vietnam.  I see  McNamara using his position to express a deeper concern, in a memo to the  president on December 6, 1965, that &quot;the odds are about even that,  even with the recommended deployments, we will be faced in early 1967 with  a military standoff at a much higher level.&quot;  (p. 359)  This book  exists mainly to show the nature of that problem.  Those who write about  these things as mere political concerns, and call such thinking the Vietnam  Syndrome, can see, if they care to look here, that this was the real nature  of the Vietnam experience as it was weighed in the scales of up and down,  when it was happening.  This book also meets McNamara head on at his usual  level.  For example, in the Epilogue, when the author &quot;suggested  quoting some things he had said, he snapped that he would deny having said  them.&quot;  (p. 614)  If McNamara could have limited what he said to  whatever was in his own best interest, he would never have told you people  so much.	2000-04-11

Anyone who  thinks that American policy in Vietnam ever made sense is underestimating  the ability of the government to lie whenever it is trying to picture what  its national honor adds up to in evens and odds.  I knew that something was  crazy when I read in Rethinking Camelot that John Newman had written a  letter to &quot;The Nation&quot; in which he said, &quot;Let's get  serious.&quot;  Actually, the policy always begged to be compared with some  outrageous joke, and &quot;The Nation&quot; has been great at coming up  with jokes (I have even read the admission by Calvin Trillin that he used  jokes in his column) to match such situations.  Possibly the funniest thing  that I ever read just showed up again in the April 10, 2000 issue of  &quot;The Nation,&quot; in a book review by John Leonard.  &quot;It's worth  recalling that when Freud finally got permission to leave Vienna in 1938,  the Gestapo obliged him to sign a certificate saying that he had been well  treated by the authorities.  He added a sentence of his own: 'I can  heartily recommend the Gestapo to anyone.'&quot;  (p. 26)  American policy  in Vietnam was always a dream of imposing that kind of order in a country  in which a majority of the people were not Americans, and might even try to  kill Americans, if you want to know the truth.  I can name one Kennedy  adviser who was willing to tell LBJ in November, 1965, that the odds were  about even that things were getting worse in Vietnam, and were going to get  a lot worse as the plans at that stage were implemented, but he wouldn't  have even been keeping his job if he told everybody what he thought.  I'm  actually glad McNamara didn't resign in protest, because he knew that other  people could do his job worse than he could, and he was willing to  sacrifice himself to save the country from the kind of stupidity that was  assumed for anyone in his position, of which he was highly aware.	2000-04-10

A book called Rethinking Camelot by Noam Chomsky introduced me to the importance of this book.  While the United States had suffered a number of defeats in countries in which we had chosen not to fight (China being  gigantic compared to France), most of the people involved in maintaining  American policy on Vietnam had accepted the idea that a way could be found  to win in Vietnam.  John M. Newman considered the importance of that idea  &quot;like going to church&quot; for the people whose actions would be  based entirely on the strength of such convictions.  My father (who was not  mentioned in the book being reviewed) was a minister who had been ordained  during World War II, possibly a good excuse for not actually fighting in  that war, but not good enough to convince me that God would always give us  perpetual peace out of the goodness of His heart for having saved the world  from the domination of anyone who actually wanted to rule here.  Chomsky's  book was based on the premise that American policy was the desire to win in  Vietnam, an aim which Kennedy couldn't have deserted until this country had  extracted the last full measure of devotion from everyone concerned.  In  the present, it should be much easier to admit the tendency to waffle, as  all things have been twisted into a psychotic multiplicity in which our  deepest desires take part in the constant attack on the facts.  As much as  those like Chomsky, who believe that Americans should maintain a certain  level of belief in policy, might differ, I am inclined to think that some  real dirt can be dug up on this issue, and this book shows what the  official record looks like when its secrecy has been stripped away.	2000-04-10

The total breakdown in  the existing order of things might help explain why the British were so  keen on finding the subatomic particle structure of matter.  The previous  discovery of the mass and charge of an electron and experiments with  radium, which naturally decays, had indicated that atoms might be capable  of being broken into smaller parts.  The discovery of the neutron in 1932  paved the way for experiments in chain reactions in which neutrons, which  were the products of splitting atoms, were used to split other atoms.  The  powers which have had uses for this knowledge have been so quick to put it  to use that it is still considered a great secret from anyone that isn't a  member in good standing of their club.  This book may be read as a  description of the life of a man who was a member of the club before anyone  knew that there was a club.  About the earliest sign in the book that some  kind of club was being formed was when Chadwick obtained some German  radioactive toothpaste, for people who need to have teeth that glow in the  dark, and tried to figure out what was in it during World War One.	2000-04-09

It was a bit  crazy for Ames to see that the KGB would be willing to pay him for telling  them the truth about what he knew, given the difficulties that would be  involved in keeping a truthful relationship of that nature a secret.  But  as Nietzsche has observed, even the hollowest nut wants to be cracked.   Spying has become a big business in our age of geopolitical dominance, and  Ames was in a position to see what the most valuable secrets are.  It is  too late for me to negotiate with him for the contents of the sawdust file,  a review of the treatment of a KGB official who wanted to provide  information to the CIA which it didn't want so much that it rigged his lie  detector tests so the results would show that he was lying even when he was  telling the truth.  I am inclined to believe that Ames felt that he was  confronting something far more evil than his own acts when he read the case  of Yuri Nosenko.  In the realm of the greatest secrets, this case is  mentioned on page 74 of Veil by Bob Woodward for being &quot;one of the  great CIA crimes&quot; in the eyes of Stansfield Turner.  William J. Casey  &quot;thought it weird that Turner would dwell on&quot; the things covered  by the report on the 1,277 days that Nosenko was kept in a cell &quot;as  part of some smarmy chess game played by&quot; the agency which defines  what covert intelligence really means for the United States.  If you read  the account of this incident by Aldrich Ames, I hope that you will feel the  urge to liberate the knowledge which it contains.	2000-04-09

I would bet that it is one joke that does  not appear in this book, simply because there isn't anything in the index  listed for science, sacred, or cow.  As a philosopher, Ted Cohen is ideally  situated to be able to assert that a joke is just a particular kind of  contrivance, but it also happens, sometimes, that a joke &quot;embodies  some profound understanding of things.&quot;  The acknowledgments of this  book, while mentioning &quot;those who have done me the blessed favor of  laughing at my jokes,&quot; approaches perfection in describing his wife as  being &quot;very nearly infallible&quot; in the very important matter of  &quot;the consideration of jokes with regard to predicting who will like  them and who will not.&quot;  In our comic society, these people may be  closer to understanding the meaning of existence than the clerk on page 73  who said, &quot;This is a hardware store.&quot;	2000-04-08

By providing a series of insights into American approaches to a conflict with enemies of the United States who happened to be foreign, if the press can  be believed, and by setting himself up as someone who wished to examine the  issue of individual guilt in this context, the author managed to transform  himself from a secret server of the system to the most famous domestic  enemy of official secrecy in matters relating to national security.  Those  people who know the identities of the President and Secretary of Defence in  November, 1965, might easily guess which one of them sent the other a  secret memo expressing the fear that the odds were about even that the  future could be worse.

His prior book,  Origin of Species, provided the scientific framework for thinking that  mankind might, in some way, be a descent from the animal kingdom.  For  personal reasons, there was some doubt, at the time, whether it would ever  be diplomatic to admit such a thing to the human beings themselves, right  in their very faces.  The title which Darwin placed on this book showed how  easy it would be to imagine that the fundamental distinction was closely  linked to the question of whom an individual might choose to have sex with,  given the great parallels to a wide range of behavior in the animal  kingdom.  I have looked in this book for evidence that philosophy is a set  of ideas adopted mainly in relation to sex, but the philosophy of the  fittest for that kind of activity seems to be a bit more modern than  Darwin.  On a scale of stillborn to born with a brain, Darwin was  definitely born with a brain, but it didn't make him crazy enough to  suggest that which we may imply ourselves.  There are a lot of facts in  this book, compared to the number of suggestions, but it shows a  considerable amount of thought.	2000-04-05

For those who find fault  with Nietzsche because his philosophy does not conform to what they would  like to believe, I would like to think that Nietzsche's best answer is like  his comment on Hamlet on page 246.  &quot;Certainty is what drives one  insane.  But one must be profound, an abyss, a philosopher to feel that  way.  We are all afraid of truth.&quot;  No doubt On the Genealogy of  Morals is great philosophy, but no one would want to compare my life to the  forms assumed by the ascetic ideal, even philosophers whose search for  truth is the hard kernal at the center of the ascetic ideal.  Outside of  philosophy, there is no ascetic ideal.  People want the moment, or eternal  salvation, or they need to conform to doctrine that distinguishes them in a  way that is not subject to the harm which the comedians of the ascetic  ideal triumph over simply by having their own ideals, or laugh, whatever.	2000-04-04

This small book is a great summary of the real ploys  which may work for or against any of these views in a particular situation.   Count me among the people who have had more trouble with doctrine than  with poetry, but who might be more open to considering questions about God  than about the meaning of life sometimes.  The big transition, near the  middle of this book, jumps from &quot;Unreal Gods&quot; to &quot;An  Adequate God.&quot;  Trying to give up the common modern substitutes in  order to worship precisely what everyone else is supposed to be worshipping  only works when those people who think they should have your real devotion  aren't paying attention.	2000-04-04

The  Epilogue of this book, in the form of a letter to Colonel Blimp, complains  of an economic order which &quot;reminds one of a certain goose which,  instead of golden eggs, lays a time bomb every day and then settles down to  hatch it.  But all this need not disturb you.&quot; (p. 250)  The section  called Purgatory starts on October 2nd, 1939, with Koestler getting out of  a bathtub and wrapping himself in a towel to answer the door, only to have  the police ask him, &quot;Have you a gun on you?&quot;  (p. 63)  The book  is full of details, and the pages that are most chilling for me are 94 and  95.  &quot;We were two thousand in the camp of Vernet.

It was my misfortune to  hope that a lot of things in this book were true before I encountered full  blown psychotic multiplicity in forms so disturbing that my friends would  vote to lock me up so I could get help.  There is a deep end which is not  well marked in this book, except by a pair of geese that get into such a  fantastic and frightful fight with each other that they must avoid getting  close to each other forever after.  Modern examples might include people  who get so close to the truth about something that they have to be taken  off the case.  This would be a truly great book if aggression was not the  kind of behavior which is likely to get any individual thrown into jail on  a moment's notice.  Putting all the instinctual background together with  total repression, I would have to say that this book should be fundamental  for understanding a lot of entertainment, but woe to the person who wants  to participate.

Due to media influences, social thought now  is largely a matter of public opinion, and I may have few companions in the  belief that, of course, it was quite proper for Nietzsche to rise to an  attack upon his own age, its public opinions, and all the ways in which  people prefer to fool themselves.  I am grateful to this book for its  outlook; merely mentioning its title is often enough to convince others  that I don't have to agree with them.  The index doesn't have a listing for  jokes, and the author seems to associate them quite closely with the  scandalous life of the composer, Wagner.  On page 120, we are told,  &quot;If that was not enough, there were Wagner's coarse jokes, which  frequently involved Cosima.&quot;  My own interest in developing the idea  of a fetish involving Nietzsche's relationship with the Wagner family has  relied on the information in this book, on that very page, that Isolde was  born in April 1865, so she was four when Nietzsche first stepped into that  family circle.  Other sources indicate that Nietzsche stopped visiting the  Wagners before Isolde turned twelve, when the composer began trying to  teach Nietzsche something about religion.  Things which may have been left  out of this biography might not be helpful for understanding the nature of  genius.  Or maybe the worst idea of a genius would be someone who knew what  all these people were thinking and wrote it down.	2000-04-04

The high point for me was a poem by a  draftee, which ended with the perfect attitude for a military mind.  &quot;Let me go into battle, / a hero I shall be. / I'm forty-four, I'm  still alive, / and the army's mind is me.&quot;  It made me glad that I  served out in the bush, and not as a clerk in some headquarters.	2000-04-03

It reduces the notion of society to a popularity contest in which fashion becomes the perfect expression of everyone's desire to be praised and noticed.  As the American economy  shifts from being a breadbasket to being the entertainment capital of a  devil in blue jeans world, this book, from a much earlier historical  period, shows how America always had the potential to achieve this kind of  greatness.  More than any other book, this one allows total enjoyment of  the thoughts which it expresses.

I doubt if I could ever find a better line than the one addressed by Jacques Derrida, in a plea for specific opposition to the brutal methods adopted by powers in Latin America, on page 81, &quot;and this on the very face of the earth itself.&quot; On pages 68 and 69, Derrida made it clear that he considered himself an outsider, who could easily have his remarks &quot;classified and forgotten even more quickly,&quot; when he was addressing a professional body on Geopsychoanalysis.  Having been born in Africa, Derrida had spent his youth on a continent where &quot;African psychoanalysis was European, structurally defined in the profoundest way by the colonial state apparatus.&quot; When I was young, I pictured our contacts with outsiders as the work of missionaries. Removing the notion of evil, as a total triumph of the state of mind of global capitalism must, if it is to consider the problem of race like it would consider anything else, leaves individuals to frame this problem in their own way.  On the subject of Africa, Christopher Lane's remarks on &quot;Savage Ecstasy&quot; and Tim Dean's attempt to tie the disease of &quot;Mistah Kurtz&quot; (p. 306) in the famous story, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; to &quot;the Historiography of AIDS&quot; leave a distinct impression.  For me to understand this book would require a look at the ways in which it treats Frantz Fanon, whom I might consider an agitator.  The more one attempts to locate an element of control here, the greater the problem seems to be. Awareness of the ability of those who serve the existing public order as mind doctors to drug, or not to drug, certain individuals (the real power of a doctor's pen, in a world of highly profitable drugs) is of hardly any benefit to a society which would like to obtain as much control as possible over the lives of those who seek any excuse that they can find (my accusation against the agitators of race) to disrupt the operation of power.  As well as the picture is framed here, I do not see race as a problem which is likely to find a solution through the actions of individuals who have assumed a professional obligation to classify individuals on the basis of how well they serve the social system.  There is a chapter on &quot;The Comedy of Domination&quot; by Kalpana Seshadri-Crooks, which looks closely at Freud, a sure sign of &quot;malicious mischief and sly humor.&quot; (p.360) This book remains insightful, on a matter which is likely to remain a real problem for those who must deal with personal problems worthy of delicate consideration, throughout.	2000-04-02

This book contains my favorite poem, but explaining it could be like trying to contend that 2001 is a really great year because it might help ordinary people realize how elements of life might be like understanding the line, &quot;until suddenly out of spitefully chewed fruit.&quot;  For me, this is the kind of poetry that Harold Bloom was trying to explain in his book, THE ANXIETY OF INFLUENCE/A THEORY OF POETRY, though Bloom's ideas ranged from Milton, with the question, &quot;Why call Satan a modern poet?&quot; (Bloom, p. 20) to more modern poets without suggesting that Rilke might have topped them all in approaching the capability suggested in Bloom's quotation from Kierkegaard, &quot;What inwardness he might have attained!&quot; (Bloom, p. 76).  My favorite poem by Rilke starts with the line, &quot;Long you must suffer, knowing not what,&quot; and ends with the assertion, &quot;No one will ever talk you out of it.&quot;  This poem explains as much about how an individual can feel, when utterly singled out by perception, as any of the puzzles that philosophy typically gropes its way through in its efforts to find a world that any one person can understand.  And the other poems in this book are also outstanding attempts to deserve the honor of being considered great poetry on a very personal level.  Among the host of contenders, the one which is easiest to find begins with the German word, &quot;Aber,&quot; so it appears first in the German index. The English translation seems to be suggesting something. &quot;But if you'd try this: to be hand in my hand / as in the wineglass the wine is wine. / If you'd try this.&quot;	2000-03-27

Walter Kaufmann did  not translate this early work by Nietzsche into English.  While Kaufmann is  widely recognized as having provided translations which were superior to  what was previously available, Nietzsche in the original German ought to be  considered better than any English version, and the truth with which  Nietzsche was concerned in his essay on Strauss might have been  particularly painful for any scholar who would like to remain at a high  level in the esteem of his peers, for the insults in this work win every  argument.  From the first words of the first section, &quot;Public opinion  in Germany,&quot; (p. 5) Nietzsche displays a worry about &quot;defeat --  indeed, the extirpation -- of the German spirit for the sake of the German  Reich.&quot;  (p. 5)  Perhaps Kaufmann was never comfortable enough with  the English language to make himself credible in a work that ends with a  section on style: &quot;perhaps Schopenhauer would give it the general  title 'New Evidence for the Shoddy Jargon of Today,' for we might console  David Strauss by saying . . . indeed, that some people write even more  wretchedly than he does. . . . We do this because Strauss does not writeas  poorly as do the vilest of all the corrupters of German, the Hegelians and  their crippled progeny.&quot;  And Strauss of course, in Germany in 1873,  was famous for providing the Germans with a guide to their beliefs and  culture, much like the works of Walter Kaufmann on Goethe, Hegel,  Nietzsche, etc., provide today's Americans with a view of individual  self-control which seeks to guide public opinion above all, or over all, or  whatever.  Perhaps, given our current status as civilizers of Europe,  Nietzsche might even maintain a view of the Americans who study his work in  accord with what he said of Strauss, he &quot;would by no means be  dissatisfied if it were a bit more diabolical.&quot;  (p. 20)  This is only  frighteningly inappropriate for those who see nothing but manipulation in  matters of public opinion, which remains about as far from the truth as it  can be stretched, and who are afraid of these things snapping back all over  the place.  I certainly think they are.	2000-03-26

Conway's chapter on the comedians of the ascetic ideal before he published  his ideas in a work all his own.  A bookmark in the chapter on the politics  of anonymity is telling me that I haven't finished that chapter, and it  hurts to know how often I would rather sleep than learn this stuff.  Please  read it.	2000-03-26

Stern which  was in the 1983 version reprinted in 1989, and which I purchased in 1990.   It is clear from that introduction that David Strauss had read the first  portion of this book and furnished his friend Rapp with a clear question  about Nietzsche's character in a letter of 19 December 1873.  &quot;First  they draw and quarter you, then they hang you.  The only thing I find  interesting about the fellow is the psychological point -- how can one get  into such a rage with a person whose path one has never crossed, in brief,  the real motive of this passionate hatred.&quot;  (p. xiv)  Those who are  familiar with legal procedures, or how the media treats anyone who is  suddenly perceived to be a fink, might enjoy this book as something that  might be considered an unforgivable outburst today.  Who could wish for  such a  triumph now, over intellectual paths which crossed twice?  When  Nietzsche was young, he perceived a scholar who displayed the real  Straussian genius.  Later, Nietzsche could only find a writer who, &quot;if  he is not to slip back into the Hegelian mud, is condemned to live out his  life on the barren and perilous quicksands of newspaper style.&quot;  (p.  54)  I could have rated this book a bit higher, for being much more  truthful than is expected of scholarly work today, but the kind of scholars  who read these books might have no idea what I meant, or they know that  they are better off not raising questions about those political issues  which are most questionable.  Nietzsche's real fearlessness began here.	2000-03-26

I am so sorry to be doing this, but I wouldn't want anyone who has read the review by Midwest Book Review to think, as its final sentence asserts, that this &quot;combines his two benchmark books under one cover.&quot;  I  happen to have a paperback edition of THE LIFE OF JESUS CRITICALLY  EXAMINED, translated into English by the famous novelist George Eliot,  itself 812 pages, in which Strauss exhibited what Nietzsche called the real  Straussian genius, as a scholar who was adept at compiling a variety of  scholarly views on the subject with a bit of dogmatic import.  As Strauss  put it on page 780 of his truly great work, &quot;as subject of the  predicate which the church assigns to Christ, we place, instead of an  individual, an idea.&quot;  Not surprisingly, the church wanted to maintain  its own selection of views on Christ, but it was still possible for Strauss  to switch from theology to more popular matters of public opinion, in which  pompous thinkers like Wagner and Schopenhauer were lightly skimmed over in  favor of the famous old masters of German thought.  Wagner and Nietzsche  found Strauss particularly vulnerable to attack, and my familiarity with  this book is entirely the result of Nietzsche's attempt to destroy it,  which provided him a freedom of speech that he could never have savored if  he had remained in Germany, a dark and dreary place thoroughly soaked in  beer, if Nietzsche can be given any credibility on matters relating to the  country of his birth.  Strauss deserves to be recognized as the best  recorder of ideas with which the most intellectual pretenders to culture  intoxicated themselves with their beer, but the jump from Christianity to  this, the contrast called forth by the title of this book, is hardly any  indication of any great leap forward.  At one time, this might have been  like a little red book of Chairman Mao Quotations for those who valued  their own opinions above all else, but it had been bested by 1873.  After  Strauss was buried, Nietzsche wrote to one of his friends that he could  hope &quot;that I did not sadden his last months, and that he died without  knowing anything about me.  It's rather on my mind.&quot;  (11 February  1874)  It might also be on the mind of anyone who reads this book today.	2000-03-26

I have been on both ends of the trip wire in this jungle: I have put a wire just above a log across a trail, (this reminds me of wearing bifocals, and not seeing anything except what the eyes first locate and focus on),  where the enemy just had the chance to dodge the blast from the claymore  mine by the time the little detonator made it blow.  I have also had my  flare pop, giving away my position, because I tried to set a spring-loaded  wire that would pop if anyone cut the tripwire.  Each flare only popped  once, of course, and a lot can depend on what is going on the first time  something happens.  The first time I read On Killing, I was amazed at how  much the army was willing to admit that it knew about conditioning people  for these situations, and half the time, in my own case, any attempt to use  my brain to improve my actions was counterproductive.    I was always way  too intellectual to be around tripwires, but the army wanted me anyway in  1968, even if the Selective Service had to send me a notice when I was at  graduate school.  Don't ever let the army tell you that it didn't know I  was smart.  Even my post-war shrink could figure that out, possibly better  than all the idiots who tried to get a shrink into my life so they could  drug me.  This is all standard procedure, but what was truly upsetting was  that I didn't have to read this book.  All I need to do is take a walk.     The most interesting aspect of On Killing for me was the relationship  between officers and men, which remains purely a matter of subjugation if  the officer can give the order requiring the men to kill.  This is perhaps  the clearest acceptance by our society of Nietzsche's doctrine of the  superman, who exercises authority in excess of what a normal person is  expected to contemplate.     I see this book's findings on the twenty year  delay between television violence and a soaring crime rate as evidence that  some individuals can identify with the Superman character muchmore easily  than they can accept the restrictions which society imposes on them but  which society itself blatantly violates whenever it has the opportunity to  demonize an enemy.  Skin for skin, as Satan says in Job, and Satan is purer  than a lot of what the army ever had to say or imply about sex or gender,  but if you have a television, you may be getting the picture.  I personally  object to writing about guys in this matter, but it is no worse than being  sent to Cambodia with an army that doesn't know what the civilians in  Cambodia look like.  I shouldn't be joking about any of this, but absurdity  was always highest in the militaristic scheme of acceptance.  As glib as  Dave Grossman (or a lot of veterans) can be in person, it was my impression   that the political alliances promoting his appearances can be treacherous.   When I heard him speak in a church basement in Minneapolis at a Friday  breakfast in February, 1999, when I asked a question, I was able to  convince the people there (a peace crowd) that I really meant what I said,  and he was just moving his lips.  It was the old military absurdity coming  through:  when nothing makes sense, say something feckless, and he did.      In most setting this topic is taboo, so the book might be a revelation for  some people.  Overall, somebody might love a cheerful killer, if somebody  is on our side, the killer is on our side, they are both in a good mood,  and neither one of them is thinking about it.  Otherwise, the topic is  likely to just miss some exciting aspects of that situation that people  (the shrink and therapists might be included in this) really don't want to  know, unless people really couldn't imagine what I was so uptight about  when I had done something truly outrageous, like my laugh.	2000-03-25

I was  ready to accept it as a coming of age for myself into the sense of what a  philosophy can try to accomplish, and 1974 was politically an ideal time  for Americans to accept the status of a superpower that wasn't about to do  anything foolish if we hadn't been able to accomplish what the almighty  dollar should be able to take care of without other undue sacrifices.  The  people who know the score on this work should allow me to skip  consideration of the parts published in 1882, and only make comments on the  additions to the second edition in 1887, especially Book V &quot;We  Fearless Ones.&quot;  Most people limit their contemplation of political  thinking to what is of some importance at the moment, and when political  views seem particularly hollow, the typical reaction is 'Only a fool would  admit it.'  Nietzsche was not writing for those people who would think that  he was a fool for publishing observations that they would find offensive.   Having gotten away with that for a few years, it was perfect for him to  admit the cheerfulness of his new outlook, trying to guess at all the  things which are really unknown and not merely secret.  Coming at this  myself from a background in militaristic thinking, it would be rather  trivial to take particular observations that Nietzsche has made and pin  them to recurring situations the way the militarisitic view is dedicated to  grabbing the media and beating it whenever it has the chance.  Some people  who have been on guard duty may recall a bit of the feeling described in  section 343, situated, &quot;as it were, waiting on the mountains, posted  between today and tomorrow, stretched in the contradiction between today  and tomorrow. . . . All the daring of the lover of knowledge is permitted  again . . .&quot;  (pp. 279-280) I believe that Walter Kaufmann was aware  of the danger that readers would understand the emotional resonance of the  terms which Nietzsche used much more than anyone would desire to appreciate  the pure honesty of his philosophy, though Kaufmann called it  &quot;philosophy that sings and sizzles.&quot;  (p. 13)  Perhaps the  greatness of this book is that it allows such excitement to be praised by  someone of Walter Kaufmann's abilities, who devoted years to the accuracy  and faithfulness of what Nietzsche actually wrote.  I doubt that anyone  else has managed to correlate as well with the way things are (&quot;This  long plenitude and sequence of breakdown, destruction, ruin and cataclysm  that is now impending&quot; on p. 279).  I suspect that other philosophers  who are considered pessimistic are shallow in comparison with this.	2000-03-25

On the topic of sex alone, I could hum more tunes  than he knew, maybe.  But the funny thing was that he considered  &quot;Kant's immense influence has proved catastrophic.&quot;  Among the  recently departed, Isaiah Berlin is quoted on the back of this book  praising Kaufmann for making people see that Hegel &quot;was a most  audacious, profound and devastating, at times wildly turbulent,  thinker.&quot;  I wish I could ask everybody, aren't we all?  Page 288  raised the question &quot;how I would feel if someone sent me an essay of  such length in which he tried to show how Nietzsche had been 'a  disaster.'&quot;  I think he would feel even worse, or possibly more joyous  in another's misfortune, if he could read all the web pages that show what  people, now, are saying about Martin Heidegger, who is merely accused of  &quot;Dogmatic Anthropology&quot; in the Trilogy outline which appeared in  this volume.	2000-03-24

I have the First Printing of 20 German Poets from 1962, and I am not trying to sell it.  It provides me with a better perspective on Kaufmann's philosophy, pulled together from his years of seeking to  comprehend what was truly worthy in German culture, and pictured perfectly  as a couplet by Schiller.  &quot;Deutsches Reich&quot;  &quot;Germany? But  where is it? I cannot find such a country. / Where the culture begins, ends  the political realm.&quot;     I would be happy if Kaufmann had learned a  bit more from his efforts to evaluate the great German poets, but he may  have comforted himself by knowing that each of them had also written a lot  which wasn't very good.  It is hardest to learn when one shouldn't write  poems.  Or maybe we were supposed to learn how we may suffer more from the  knowledge of how life can resemble the worst poems more than the best of  philosophies, in deeper bitterness.  To make things worse, when people put  everything in the world to music now, sometimes the music is so good that  the thoughts don't want to go away.   In one of his later works, I believe  Walter Kaufmann expressed regret that he had never studied music, as if  translating some of the most critical comments ever rendered on music drama  counted for nothing, and as if there was some affliction here, but he  didn't get it.  But he had been so busy: the German poets were a better  match for his personal problems than he ever knew, and he was lucky that he  had so much to choose from to inform a public that could suddenly make such  intellectual attainment popular in a deeply personal way, like I had never  experienced it before.  Writing in 1961, W.K. chose to say &quot;This  volume is not an anthology but aims to be a book of one piece.&quot;  That  kind of goal didn't figure that life could be lived by changing channels.	2000-03-24

Although this programme was initially tied to the exercise  of power, it here becomes a rule of thought, a metaphysical conception . .  . It is not simply a matter of destroying the notions of the true and the  false; it also concerns the entrance of obscure forces on to the stage  through the moral ruin of the intellect.&quot;  I read this book as a way  of approaching an understanding of the politics of a superpower which is  dedicated to keeping its strategic thinking truly nukers, but I appreciated  the book more for the frank realization of the pain involved in facing such  a dismal philosophy realistically.  Nietzsche admitted this most clearly in  a letter which he wrote to Gast on 5 October 1879, &quot;I have reasons for  fidelity here, for 'behind thought stands the devil' of a tormenting attack  of pain.&quot; (p. 18)  The letters printed from pages 16 to 22 in the  chapter on &quot;The Origin of a Semiotic Impulse&quot; are outstanding.  On a lighter note, I could play games with the index, where  &quot;Jokes&quot; would appear, but it wouldn't be nice for those involved  if I pointed out that there aren't any entries between . . . (this would  have been funnier if there was an entry for the Joint Chiefs of Staff).  There are a lot of entries for &quot;monstrosity,&quot; though.  Using the  index entry for absurdity leads to the assurance that there are some limits  which really ought to be observed, because &quot;formations of sovereignty  cannot claim to exercise the absurd as violence--if they do not assign  themselves a meaning--a meaning in which servitude, the subjected forces,  would participate-- and this meaning can never be that of pure  absurdity.&quot;  (p. 119)  In short, it is possible to read this book,  but itis hardly likely to be edifying unless the reader is deeply vexed  and willing to surrender a lot of the sense that a simple circle could  pretty much sum up everything, or put things in their respective places and  keep them there.	2000-03-23
