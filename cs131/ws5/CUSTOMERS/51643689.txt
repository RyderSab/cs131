While it makes sense that a publisher would want to maximize its investment in an author, it appears to be a disingenuous move for an author who clings to notions of artistic idealism (at a talk in Dallas he said he would not allow HOL to be turned into a movie). Now I hear from a popular website that a forthcoming book is imminent (of course this could just be a rumor akin to one about the house!) And I'll admit in fairness to Mark D.: I'm an author who contradicts himself quite a bit!<br /><br />What's wrong with him releasing another book? you may ask. Well, nothing, unless you consider the same talk in Dallas (which happened back around 2001/2, I believe, in which he said that it would be about ten years before another book appeared from him (implying that it is a marathon-like process to do a book)*. So the rumors and apparent contradictions mirror the labyrinthine corridors of \\"the house\\" - making this author not only one of the most successful of our generation, but a seeming master at marketing; and revealing that reality mirrors fiction (and both can be crazy and chaotic). One thing's for sure: HOL is a remarkable artistic and commercial accomplishment. Also, Haunted is a really rockin' disc!<br /><br />The legend of HOL continues with the spirit of both Poes hauntingly humming in the background...and no valuable footnotes anywhere to be seen.<br /><br />*footnote 1a.

There are wonderful black and white illustrations throughout.<br /><br />The chapters are well-organized and highly informative.<br /><br />I could have done without the cheesy \\"hemp model shot\\" on the back of the book, but it's not enough to avoid giving this marvelous book a five star rating!	2005-08-02

The listener is gradually taken through a kaleidoscopic array of sound reminiscent of recent work in other incarnations (namely Speed Tribe and Male or Female). Within moments it is apparent that this is no experimental soundscape bereft of true power (not that the aforementioned are, for they are brilliant). It's just that Front 242 always ups the ante. Your aural nerves begin to bristle as the hair on your mortal frame stands straight up. Are you so much as actually evolving through the process of immersing yourself in such sound...probably.<br /><br />This work is filled with mysterious but highly meaningful lyrics sung through the inimitable and ageless voice of Jean Luc De Meyer. When musicians of this extraordinary caliber collaborate with a vocalist who demands the very best, it creates a wonderfully lethal production of sound. Your nervous system is stimulated profoundly by such magic. It is not unusual for electronic music to tamper with your neurons a bit. Nor is it bizarre for \\"traditional\\" music, when done well, to move you emotionally. This is the vortex that the masters of Front 242 have cornered. They have explored the richest tapestries of possibilities, coalesced that knowledge with inherent genius and delivered this infinitely pleasurable and enduring music.<br /><br />You simply cannot call this \\"pop,\\" \\"industrial\\" or any other label. This is pure art: transcendent of categories and capable of obliterating expectations and goading the listener into a higher level of cognitive function.<br /><br />As a lover of music I am rarely this excited about what I hear these days. Pulse is transformative and soul-invigorating in the best and most unimaginable ways.<br /><br />Front 242 pulls from literature, visual art and music (just to name a few of the million wonderful things which must go into this) in a delightful syncretism and magical blend that blows you away.<br /><br />I simply cannot stop listening and my brain is ravaging this disc.<br /><br />Astounding work.

The author wisely discovers the many facets of Watts' brilliance while not shying away (nor too harshly condemning) his failings.<br /><br />I was a little put off by her condemnation of Leary and her accusations/implications that many more suffered, rather than benefited, from their entheogenic explorations. Also, given the modest size of this book it struck me as odd that she was so critical of Watts' autobiography, from which she surely pulled much information. Having just read biographies of Aldous Huxley and Clive Barker, both of which were expansive compared to Zen Effects, it seemed strange to so quickly get through this one.<br /><br />All-in-all I think she did a pretty good job, writing something that is eloquent and memorable, and this work will hopefully steer many toward the wonder of Alan Watts.	2005-05-05

Another one of my favorite biographies (that I've read in the last year) is Aldous Huxley, An English Intellectual, by Nicholas Murray - but this one on Clive Barker is phenomenal! I'm stunned by the exhaustive research and careful analysis that these highly gifted biographers bring to the table.<br /><br />Winter is highly descriptive and brings revelation after revelation in vivid, intelligent detail. My only complaint would be that practically every rock is unturned in Barker's various works. This is great if you have read or seen them all; but if you are new to Barker, it pretty much gives a lot away! This complaint is overcome by the magnitude of such a monumental work as this. Winter is a true genius. The skilled writing is so entertaining that any sin is easily forgiven!<br /><br />Artists who have left (and are leaving) such a profound influence are worthy of the infinite efforts of a truly grand investigator/author; and Mr. Barker got the expert treatment on this one, indeed.	2005-01-14

Through his amazing forays and obsessions, we gain insight into an extraordinary life. It is no less extraordinary that this man is still alive, after repeated attempts to immerse himself into the hard drug underbelly of Los Angeles.<br /><br />Just like we experience through the beautiful and accomplished album, By The Way, the reader emerges from the rich experience of reading this book with fresh insights and appreciation for the vagaries of an incredible life; with all its ups and downs. Serious ups and downs!<br /><br />Kiedis, although coming across as arrogant and belligerent in his early days, (which he readily admits to), becomes so ultimately appealing because he seems open to learning important lessons along the way. He is willing to transform, turning a propensity for trouble and self-indulgence into a desire to help others and powerfully affect them through his gifts - his music.<br /><br />I was moved deeply (and entertained by the debauchery!) by this academically talented college drop-out who went full speed ahead into his desire to make music. He has consistently gone to the drawing board time and time again (despite lengthy and pesky drug excursions) to express himself, in collaboration with other crazy musical talents, and deliver masterful productions.<br /><br />Some say that RHCPs have slowed down and become too chilled out. I disagree. They are more mature and now draw from a wider skill set and breadth of experience that informs their music and gives it nuances to be treasured. To be able to hear funk with symphony, or pop with rap, or electronica with ballads, in such deft combinations that sound so delicious - is the hallmark of RHCP. The songs are infectious and lasting. The music is constantly evolving in astounding ways.<br /><br />Kiedis is like the affable battered genius or the philosopher/boxer/Bodhisattva who has devoted himself to an adventurous and dangerous existence - in order to mine spiritual and auditory riches for the rest of us (especially those like me who have chosen safer routes) to enjoy. Rock on you shining diamond.<br /><br />In hopes that this unique and brilliant rock-and-roller keeps that promise to his dog and stays in touch with the inherent powers that have gotten him this far.

Lopez, Jr., let me say that it strikes me as one of the most long-winded, derogatory and self-serving forewords I have ever seen in a book; not to mention the fact that the foreword is advertised on the cover of this edition. Donald Lopez insults Evans-Wentz on every page and goes on to tear down Jung, as well.<br />There are genuine reasons for why marvelous works by men such as W.Y. Evans-Wentz stay in print, and they go far beyond the bruised egos of stoic/pedantic academics like Lopez. When so-called Buddhist scholars, such as Lopez and Thurman, project themselves as arrogant intellectuals, it contradicts everything that Evans-Wentz stood for.<br />Oxford University Press should be ashamed for pulling in a voice so anti-thetical to the spirit of this work. The work, itself, is awesome and is hindered only by the hypercritical Lopez touch.	2004-07-11

In that sense, he is effectively using the concept of &quot;lottery&quot; to enrich his own self-proclaimed idyllic and scenic life by the lake with his psychologist wife. So I'll give the book two stars for being at least authoritative in a shifty, sort of tongue-in-cheek way.<br />While his website can be mildly amusing, when not as disturbing as this book, (and his love for animals is endearing), I sincerely hope he is getting proper treatment from his live-in shrink.

There is much in this work that will incite anger at the memory of Harry Anslinger, who evokes comparisons to all the freedom-haters (within and without America) currently destroying natural rights that should be beyond government's grasp. On this note, there is a &quot;gore file&quot; photo used by Anslinger in his marijuana-hate campaigns that is truly shocking and revolting. Just a warning as you're flipping through the photos that they are not all placid, green fields of scenery.<br />The intro and afterword, not to mention the attractive cover design, enhance this superb book; also, the price is a bargain.	2004-04-26

For such an astounding musician to also be an adept writer is almost mind-boggling (and jealousy-inducing!). Some have argued that the author comes across as arrogant or condescending. I felt that any movements in that direction were nicely tempered by insightful self-reflections and assessments. That being said, I would certainly hate to be &quot;Elsa&quot; who comes across as old, lazy and whining - which perhaps she was - but the author sees fit to mention this at almost every turn. Maybe he's just being honest, but at times I did feel that this brilliant Canadian was dabbling in a tad too much hubris (directed at Americans and Africans).<br />Any complaints about this marvelous work are easily offset by an engaging, highly intelligent, but readable account, of exploring Africa by bike. Not to mention a keen sense of humor, informed by a breadth of knowledge way beyond most &quot;rockers.&quot; We all knew that Peart could write great rock songs; but in this work he really pushes the envelope and succeeds at a literary travelogue that can hold its own against any other.<br />I would have liked to have seen him participating in drum rituals or sessions with African drummers. That would have added so much to the text, but perhaps he wanted to avoid that and simply write as any other journeyer. Despite his marked cynicism, which one would expect from such a great mind, a real sense of humanity shines through. He gives life to those he encounters with all their frailties, but also strengths and charms.<br />All-in-all this is a lively, vivid and enriching journey that is worth every drop of ink on the pages.<br />Very, very entertaining.	2004-03-06

The author leaves no rock unturned within this concentrated study.<br />At times, the author goes on endlessly with heavy passages quoted from other sources (which proves tedious), but this is balanced by an insightful, judicious study of the subject matter that includes humorously exposing frauds whenever possible. The reader definitely feels compelled to keep turning the page.<br />I recommend this one...	2004-02-22

And I'm intrigued that a popular writer is delivering such goods to a mainstream audience.<br />It's just that The Name of The Rose and Foucault's Pendulum (both by Eco) did it so much better. Not to mention the non-fiction works of such writers as Pagels and Capra.<br />I'll give it a second read and see if I'm missing something - if so, I'll revise/update my review.	2004-01-28

Now, that being said, this book - like so many of his others - is filled with unique insights, factual data about time, place and activities; not to mention fanciful but substantial musings and experiential approaches to the subject that prove very workable.<br />With many books published by Llewellyn approaching ideas from an accessible, highly useful format, one should glean the insights then move forward into other works to add to this knowledge.<br />For instance, coalescing Buckland's ideas with those of Israel Regardie and Christopher Hyatt will prove a multi-dimensional and hearty meal certainly worthy of your time and energy.	2003-12-18

At times there are harsh words expressed about Leary and the sixties. At other times there is praise and admiration. I believe that balance is basically achieved through this approach.<br />Dr. Slack seems an alternately considered and adventurous participant in the wild goings on of the time. At times, he seems to be analyzing the subject and at other times seems to rush headlong into the bizarre experiences like any other anxious, adventurous kid.<br />It was interesting to read an account by one who is not an unbridled supporter of the era or the icon Leary. Dr. Slack is a self-professed member of the establishment in some ways; in other ways he is a fearless neuronaut like the others.<br />It begs the question: what would Leary have said about Slack?<br />Overall this work is an entertaining romp through the multicolored corridors of a very interesting time. Leary serves as the elusive one being intellectually hunted by so many.<br />The author, Dr. Slack, does a noble job of painting a uniquely rich version of the events.	2003-12-01

Call it Yin Yang politics. It ain't perfect, but it's a lot of fun. Opposing sides duking it out to stimulate an economy left floundering by Enron greedsters and equally demonic bureaucrats.<br />Hail to the Thief.	2003-10-08

The articles are tied together by interesting quotes and intriguing, often disturbing photos. I skipped a point because I would have liked the photos to be referenced. I was left wondering about place of origin: what museum, cathedral, etc. In fairness, this complaint is somewhat offert by the inclusion of a highly interesting appendix that includes a list of freethinkers.<br />All-in-all this a probing analysis of religion in a manner that seems to strive for greater understanding - not just a negating of beliefs.<br />Like the best works that open your mind to facts your private school and your church never told you, you come away feeling empowered and enlightened.

Many are intimidated by the imagined sense of orthodoxy - not to mention the high number of practitioners who seem to take themselves so seriously.<br />This book happily throws \\"authority\\" and dogma out the window. While integrating methodology and experience into its message, it explores the routes of chaos magic that fall more into the dimenions of a practice such as Zen, as opposed to the practice of any church or organization. Personal choice is key. Individualized approaches are acceptable. One comes away laughing at dogma junkies!<br />Bravo Mr. Hine for creating this down-to-earth, yet inspiring overview that demonstrates so eloquently the various paths of chaos magic. The reader is treated to a delightful explanation of the powers of concentration, attention and imagination.<br />Mr. Hine divides the book into diverse sections which explain everything from finding the humor in magic to drawing correlations between quantum mechanics and the way that chaos manifests in hundreds of other universal aspects.<br />I was recovering from surgery when re-reading this wonderful book and found solace and comfort in its wisdom. Along with the array of medicine, beverages and \\"doctor-recommended\\" remedies, this book serves as nourishment for the spirit. I gleaned inspiration from its pages that actually fostered healing and revivified my mind while my entire system healed.<br />One can derive much confidence and pleasure from sinking the mind into a work that so deftly merges science with spirituality.<br />Phil Hine accomplishes many things in this timeless classic.	2003-08-02

The positive spins are still right around the corner and to me hit harder the darker the trip has been.<br />Who's surprised by a fifteen-year-old \\"gifted\\" child who is also complicated and sometimes a royal pain the in the a**? Gnostic gospels, anyone? Also, aren't we a little beyond being concerned about what is or is not appropriate for people to read? If your child has read the others and can get through this one, then it is quite likely that she/he is a discerning individual who is bright and mature enough to handle what comes their way in this kind of literature. Your child vigorously reading this book should engender more excitement on your part than anything else -but then constrictive moralists are as rampant as they ever were. I like how some of the parents horde these books for themselves while condemning the childrens' reading. It is fitting of Rowling's more nefarious characters in the books. Funny.<br />Rowling displays a unique elegance in the struggle between forces of good and evil in a style that is true to her tradition but that also reflects a willingness to venture into more experimental territory like the characters in this book (who deftly explore some familiar and not too familiar realms of fantasy and magic).<br />I, too, was expecting a few more surprises and revelations to justify the incredible hype, but she did a satisfactory job nevertheless.<br />For what it is, it ain't too bad.	2003-07-11

That sort of shifty behavior is reminiscent of McNamara and others. It smacks of the same sort of determination that other military heads have taken in equally dubious, ambiguous tasks: parlaying their actual war experience into a \\"war on drugs\\" and making whimsical, inexplicable decisions during actual wars (Powell and Schwartzkopff during The Gulf War).<br />What is informative and worthwhile about this book is that it deftly sticks to mainly the issues instead of hyperbole about \\"moral indiscretions\\" in the bedroom. Here's where I differ from conservatives who love to lambast all of liberalism and libertarianism: I can concede when the opposing author has made some valid points.<br />What is ultimately bothersome about this work is that it deflects blame and scapegoats onto a man already \\"tried and convicted\\" by the increasingly popular conservative press, when if anything blame should be shared with him. Buzz Patterson does very little self-disclosure and too much demonizing and then takes the money and runs.<br />I always thought the military had higher standards than that.	2003-04-03

Hypocrisy is the worst characteristic of the \\"Right.\\"<br />In response to all those who write in complaining that we liberals never comment on the content in these books, I have an answer: we look for content and substance that we are used to and we come up dry! The \\"Left\\" is often better read than the \\"Right\\" and we often become aghast to discover works like this - that offer so little - skyrocketing up the sales charts. We falsely assume that there must be something to it. Reading O'Reilley and others is like pluggin' your adult brain into Barney for grown-ups. You have some laughs, get some giggles and go away hungry for quality programming!<br />If just one of these books can ultimately prove more enlightening or amusing than one off-night episode of The Simpsons, I'll gladly wax poetic on the wonderful substance and content of the work. Until then I'll stick with matching the artificialty of the work I am reviewing.<br />It never ceases to fail.

The story is a moving, very touching tribute to the life of a man named Grady.<br />We are taken deep into the troubled life of a man hopelessly stricken by the horrible effects of alcohol addiction. While full of life and talent as a remarkable dancer and entertaining, loving human being, he could not shake the inner demons that haunted him. The narrator takes us through the chapters of Grady's life including the hopes and dreams he had for himself and those his family and friends had for him. The author uses a fitting parallel of a stranger on the street as a reference point for the prototype lost soul, in search of peace and happiness that seems ultimately elusive.<br />Like Kafka and Dostoevsky, MS. Ware explores the psychology of the troubled soul in gripping detail, documenting every nuance and facet to demonstrate the harsh realities of the character's ordeal. We learn to relate to the basic quandary of choosing between a long life of enduring satisfaction versus a \\"live fast and die young\\" approach that sucks many in. It begs the question: which is the better path? When the void is calling what determines the various paths we take? Is it free will or ordained by other more powerful forces of determination?<br />We gain such insights as, \\"he was a prisoner to his addiction, and those who suffer from addictions often find themselves being used by the strong,\\" when referring to Grady working for his brother for \\"peanuts.\\"<br />Another line that struck a chord in me:<br />\\"The strong indeed do survive, but they cannot survive without preying on the meek.\\"<br />I found it fascinating and illuminating to discover different theories about society's role in fostering addiction and the unusual battles of one who goes against the norm and throws all caution and prudence to the wind.<br />The reader will become endeared to Grady and feels the narrator's pain in pulling for his ultimate victory.<br />This is a tear-jerker - an absorbing analysis of the struggle of the human soul.<br />MS. Ware is an insightful, eloquent writer who brings tangible life to her characters and a fresh perspective to the subject of addiction.

Regardie happened to be one of the most interesting purveyors of magick in the tradition of Crowley and even further back, the original mystics and occult greats.<br />What is fascinating to me is that despite Regardie's well-known ego clashes with Crowley, the original theories are expounded upon in a similar tradition to that of Jung carrying Freud's theories forward.

The Power of Now represents one of those books that is not one of the heavy hitting intellectually stellar works on my shelf but the book serves a real purpose and benefits people. Here's why: Getting through the labyrinthine texts of Buddhism and Mysticism, translating it for Westerners in a meaningful way and serving it up in a manner that is easily digestible requires a lot of work. The modern book buyer is often too impatient to pursue the wonderful titles by Alan Watts, which in a more poetic way pretty much say everything that is said in \\"Now,\\" and more. Most people do not have time for that. They want an easy-to-get, nicely presented work that IS EASY TO READ.<br />Yes, that is scary in a sense, but as long as they are getting good ideas, should we hold it against them? I don't think so. If they weren't reading this, it may be something their favorite talk show host recommended which turns out to be far worse. Imagine a book on enlightenment according to Benny Hinn! At least Tolle is a likable and believable chap.<br />Tolle serves up the \\"Thou Art That\\" motif in an easy to assimilate language and a palatable question/ answer format that renders a \\"communicate the basic idea\\" style.<br />Personally, I prefer the edgier works such as \\"Undoing Yourself\\" by Hyatt. However, the reality is that someone buys a book in an airport and wants a nugget of divine wisdom served up with the peanuts. This work is perfect for them.<br />While babysitting the nephews, I removed this copy from my relative's bookshelf and began to flip through its pages. It is perfect when you have a kid on one arm and limited attention to devote to a book. The ideas are straightforward (and despite some new age mumbo jumbo from time to time) are communicated with a decent flair for writing.

It is lysergic inspired literature of the most amusing sort, guaranteed to force you to become a lot less serious about most everything. Is that so bad?<br />How can you go wrong when it is filled with such wonderful nuggets of wisdom as: \\"When you meet another bodhisattva on the road, greet him with neither words nor silence.\\" \\"That leaves you with a vast selection of barnyard noises from which to choose.\\"<br />Also, it stimulates such interesting questions as, if Jesus was a Jew - why was he given a Puerto Rican name?<br />Principia is light-hearted, fun loving iconoclasm. It is the voice of Chaos coming through loudly and clearly with humor and wit. Dropping off a copy at your local revival will surely get the juices flowing and the people jumping. Keeping a copy close to your bed at night will enhance your dreaming and make you a better person. All-in-all it is a wonderfully twisted little book that gives you all of life's answers by one who has quite simply figured out everything. It is every self-help book wrapped up into one.<br />All encompassing and vacuous at the same time. Who could ask for anything more?	2003-03-07

Eco's vast repertoire of knowledge shines through in such detail and vividness to uniquely render stunning imagery and lasting impressions. The story ain't too shabby, either.<br />The story deals effectively with the realms of religion, mythology, symbols, psychology and mysticism - just to name a few. The reader is pulled into a sophisticated cognitive game that proves enlightening and thought provoking FOR YEARS to come.<br />Eco set the bar extremely high on this one.	2003-03-05

Tying sex with \\"Satan\\" may be one of the most evil messages ever sent. It leads to most of the psychological disorders that young men and women develop, generates a \\"hedonistic\\" backlash comparable to the War on Drugs and thwarts the intelligent use of contraceptives (which in turn leads to unwanted pregnancies and abortions).<br />This book is so hopelessly puritanical and backwards that it just might resurrect The Taliban.<br />Atrocious, close-minded and anti-Christian. An abomination of a book.	2003-03-03

Can America be dumbed down anymore? Sure.<br />At least Bill O'Reilly is expert on the \\"Completely ridiculous\\" in our society - for he earnestly churned out its news night after night for years on tabloid tv. The fact that people take this stuff (Limbaugh-inspired) seriously, assures me that true libertarians shall always be listened to.<br />It's almost as if the universe from time to time spawns a character like O'Reilly to create a necessary backlash and wake up intelligent mindsets to the horrifying possibilities for powerful - yet demented - voices in the media.<br />Keep up the ridiculous work, Bill.

This work starts off rather somber in peering into the madness of religious extremism and all its dastardly deeds. We see the violence and evil wrought on unexpecting people. We see war-driven animals bent on twisting scriptures to suit their ends.<br />Gradually and ultimately completely we move toward a rich optimism that the great world religions can work together to foster the overwhelming message of peace and happiness and turn it into reality.<br />We are given well thought out insights into practical solutions to remedy many of the world's problems. The reader is provided details on the truly wondrous nature of philosophy and religion when they are properly experienced.<br />Most \\"religious writers\\" tend to want to shove their beliefs down your throat whether you want it or not. Not Dr. Meister. He provides a refreshingly diverse, comprehensive and highly entertaining discourse on timely issues and their relevance to everyday life. He isn't pushing one belief on you.<br />One comes away from the read with a renewed interest in deciphering the good from the bad in religion and the knowledge to back it up.<br />Rarely do I review a work that I deem is so important to what is going on in the world at this very moment. Let me emphasize that I find this work immensely helpful to the current world situation. It proves invaluable to those on every side of the fence.<br />I enjoy Dr. Meister's works time and time again.	2003-02-12

I like how he applies the same brazen in your face methods of his enemy (the Right). He comes on so belligerent and overbearing at times that one could mistake him for a Republican mole. Remember how much money the government gets off book sale taxes.<br />If you are feeling a bit sinful and wanting to take a trip on the wild \\"liberal\\" side, read this one and then Robert Anton Wilson's TSOG.

Taking the reader on a comprehensive and insightful tour de force, we are given delightful, exciting substance not found in other biographies. The author elegantly and solidly paints a vivid picture of the astounding life of Crowley, his varied - and often bizarre - interests and influences, and the multiple directions his life took.<br />What is unique about this work is the revealing nature of its chapters which offer detailed accounts of letters, \\"magickal\\" practices and previously unexplored facets to this extraordinary life. The author seems to want to give you all the goods, which I like.<br />Two other wonderful works about this fascinating subject - `Astrology, Aleister, and Aeon,' and `Do What Thou Wilt' - when taken in consideration with this one, provide a delightful trilogy that vouchsafes the most relevant and probing ideas surrounding their subject. When all three are read, one captures a thorough picture of Crowley, for better or worse.<br />Crowley, the highly controversial mountaineer, magician and writer, is rendered powerful and frail, alluring and repulsive: many lives wrapped up into one. Intriguing, to say the least.<br />An extensive Notes and References section that pushes this magnificent work close to 600 pages makes the price an absolute bargain. Not to mention the glorious cover art that really must be held to appreciate.<br />I have no real complaints about this excellent book! I give it my highest recommendation.	2003-01-23

I found the language sumptuous and the story intriguing, though (and because) many of the prophecies in this book have come to fruition.<br />DJB writes with an uncanny flair for the idealistic and the romantic with the piercing edge of a scientist. His dreams are way bigger than most and his conscious mind travels into dimensions equally vast, intricate and hopeful.<br />This highly unique form of writing jump starts the mind and lifts the reader into paradise.<br />A most enjoyable work!	2002-12-11

Like a natural anti-depressant, these illuminating, entertaining words are capsules of ancient teachings framed in language that is readily understood and instantly enjoyed.<br />Alan Watts was adventurous and peaceful, wise but personable. That essential essence really comes through nicely in this work.	2002-12-11

Capable of evoking hysterical laughter and revelation all in the same quip, Wilson delivers punch after punch of thoughtful thrills. TSOG is rapturous, raucously humorous, and pleasurably mind-boggling. What other book takes you from the exciting works of luminaries such as Ezra Pound and Alfred Korzybski to side splitting sections on unidentified flying virgins and why Hannibal Lecter would be suitable as President!<br />Wilson's mind is razor sharp but as thrillingly imaginative as ever with delightful intellectual surprises around every corner. The reader marvels at Wilson's uncanny ability to interconnect the Church with the U.S. government with the Mafia and sundry other human folly.<br />The author openly bashes the hypocrisies of \\"faith-based organizations\\" and the many dangers of orthodoxy.<br />A lively account of a trip to Cannabis Cup leads to various wonderful uses of the \\"f\\" word.<br />Bungling idiots in office are skewered like never before in parodies that challenge the best of Hollywood's comedy writers to hyperkinetic runs for the money.<br />Mainly the thrill of reading Wilson is the uniquely acerbic but always light-hearted and comedic tone which reminds you what is so important about freedom. In the end you may not have created a rupture in the power structures but your mind has roamed through dimensions that are constantly considered off-limits.<br />Wilson shows all of us that thought processes are not heretical -that we are free to use our minds as we see fit. In this spirit exists the only real hope that while living in an increasingly more restrictive society we, the people - and not our Tsarist government - will ultimately be victorious.	2002-11-10

Metzner brings vitality and encyclopedic awareness to every project. An elder statesman responsible for such dramatic shifts in consciousness within this nation and throughout the world, buy his works and read them with pleasure.<br />What is striking about this work is the respect he brings to the subject and the well-constructed tapestry of thought contained within the pages.<br />Also, the design of this book is beautiful.<br />Solid content with the stamp of greatness.

Among McKenna's work, I find this one to require the greatest stretch or leap of the imagination - which makes it one of my favorites!<br />To fully enjoy and understand the brilliance of McKenna, one must open up their intuition and greatest capacity for open-mindedness. We are dealing with visionaries musing at the extremes and blissing out with philosophic rapture or torture at almost every turn. These are experiences way beyond the &quot;realities&quot; most will ever know.<br />Another remarkable capacity of Terence was his ability to spin the words in a way that adventurously captures the essence of the experience while entertaining his readers literally BEYOND BELIEF!<br />As for the entheogen-cynics that knocked McKenna: He had more insight and made more contribution than all the cynics put together.<br />Long live his indomitable spirit!	2002-10-21

Families are always wondering &quot;Is it just us?&quot; Are we the only crazy ones?<br />Franzen provides a way for the reader to delight in the idiosyncracies of his characters, richly developed personae of paranoia and paralyzation of emotions.

Unlike typical &quot;self-help&quot; books that rely on traditional methods to gradually attempt to move you toward a greater level of psychological health, Undoing sets up a crafty, experiential web of mind tricks that seem designed and effective at tripping you into better understanding. Akin to Zen koans, these are modern powers of suggestion at times powerfully disarming and highly amusing.<br />Falcon preserves the original essence of the earlier editions and includes updated pages by Hyatt and peers. These updated pages, which include commentary on such recent events as 9/11, somehow flow seamlessly from their predecessors and also lend variety by including the voices of others.<br />Some do not realize that in addition to excelling in the realms of psychology and literary ventures, Hyatt is an extremely talented visual artist who uses this ability to give flesh to the ideas in this book. There are many pages of captivating images that help elucidate the points in humorous and McLuhan-esque ways.<br />On the practical side, for under twenty bucks you really get a lot of pages of beautiful madness.

In collaboration with S. Jason Black, of course, he eloquently destroys your mind, in the sense of happily showing you ways of tearing down many of the misconceptions, biases, and prejudices you and others have been filling your pretty little head with all these years.<br />Is Dr. Hyatt perfect - hell no. This is precisely why his works are ultimately so convincing. Eschewing the tendency on the part of most \\"academics\\" to proselytize their message from a haughty, self-righteous perspective, Hyatt goes in for the intellectual jugular with street smarts. He uses intelligent but emphatic, concise dialogue that gives you the goods pronto (and in a nicely self-effacing manner that shows you he has struggled himself).<br />Somehow, within the context of breaking down orthodox views (Hyatt was highly critical of church officials long before it became fashionable) and obliterating all our stupid thoughts, he manages to give us hope. Pacts With The Devil, like so many of his works, performs the ritual of giving you options to change your viewpoints and then supplant them with new and improved ideas. Sort of like rebuilding the transmission in your car. Your \\"cortex converter\\" gets a much needed oil change that - contrary to popular opinion that destroying some of your 'core' beliefs is bad - leaves you refreshed and fulfilled, with at least most pistons firing like they should. Yes, my friend, you are getting torqued.<br />This is what's so elegant and fun about it - you get the things you originally set out for once you break down so many of the original ambitions and expectations you came with. How Zen. How Kabalistic. And yes dear pagans, ironically (the Devil would love irony, wouldn't he), how very mystically Christian.	2002-05-18

I, for one, am an amateur when it comes to the formal practice of withcraft; but it is a subject of much interest to me. Mr. Plaisance provides a substantial and clearly detailed overview of the practice and its benefit to human lives. His narrative - combined with invaluable mythological references - is refreshingly accepting of varied belief systems. His recommendations are inclusive of those varying perspectives that readers may bring to the table. Nevertheless, he is a stickler for accuracy and purity of the message.<br />Chapters are divided up into dimensions of the practice with at times simple, yet apparently effective, descriptions of how to go about performing rituals and achieving change.<br />The thing I like best about works such as this is the way they are so egalitarian in their approach of vouchsafing knowledge to readers. You can either follow every single step included and actually act out, or one can approach it from a more intellectual<br />mind set and glean little insights along the way that enrich whatever you are already doing.<br />Enhancing concentration, minimizing neurosis, and applying seasoned methodologies are aspects of \\"Reclaim\\" that make this a hallmark for the psychologist's, as well as the magician's, library.<br />I had the pleasure of meeting Monte Plaisance recently in New Orleans. His affability and sincerity serve as a testament to character-enhancing benefits of the practice he professes.<br />There is no better way for me to break down any stereotypes about religions or belief systems than to meet one who exemplifies the higest tenets of their professed faith. Instantly that brings me into a realm of open-mindedness and curiosity.<br />This book is a wonderful introduction to those things mysterious.	2002-05-11

A certain cynicism usually kicked in and got in the way of my even picking up a book with the word \\"Astrology\\" in its title.<br />Silly Me.<br />Something profound drew me to this book and I have been thankful ever since. This highly impressive work is a benchmark for what makes for truly great reading, in my opinion. A nice coalescence between hard core science and then fanciful, poetic musings. To remain so open-minded while maintaining a well-grounded basis really gives Mr. Kipp an edge on others who have attempted similarly lofty tasks. Kipp elegantly pulls together a symphony of ideas.<br />Tying together such disparate topics as mysticism, astrology, psychoanalysis, history, and science - no simple task - is performed by Mr. Kipp with unique scholarship, and impeccable flair.<br />The rascal Aleister Crowley is rendered very human and great sympathy is aroused by Kipp's amusing characterization of Crowley's strange and at times brutal upbringing. We are compelled to understand the psychology and mythology inherent in Crowley's (and our own) universe.<br />Ultimately, we are brought full circle to a deep insight of the theoretical perspectives - including both critical and expansive views - necessary to establish a sense of \\"wholeness.\\"<br />This reader was left amazed at the beauty of the language and the harmonious interplay of really cool, strange subjects.<br />My amazement at the fact that someone could come up with the idea for this book was superseded by the fact that the idea was so powerfully executed.<br />Bring us another one, Master Kipp.	2002-01-26

It is an incredibly thorough and mind opening epic that reads as entertainingly as the best of novels, while providing about ten times as much information. In a time when we are questioning the subject of world religions, this book is a much needed discourse written by a truly brilliant man who takes the reader from the basics up through very recent events.<br />While some may feel that the in depth study of religion would be dry and snooze-inducing, this work is anything but. It is exciting, highly educational and fills the mind with very useful information.<br />Its interesting style of going back and forth between the ups and downs, positives and negatives, of many of the world's religions, is enjoyable and refreshing.<br />Its breadth of facts and insightful data will completely satisfy and often startle you.<br />I highly recommend this immensely important work!	2001-12-24

Beautifully written in a manner both scholarly and exciting, HOL grabs your mind and pulls you into one of the most bizarre escapades ever imagined.<br />The number of footnotes is as infinite as the esoteric references, which to readers like me isn't much of a problem and very frequently a joy.<br />I didn't so much care for what was happening to each character as I was enraptured with time and time again getting caught up in the whole diversion of the writing and the palatable nature of reading this book the way it was designed, textually and visually.<br />The book is encyclopedic in its scope and masterfully written, which easily overrides concerns of bombast in design.<br />I am not sure with whom I'm more impressed, the author for creating such a magnum opus, or the reader who undertakes a no- less monumental task. The beauty is the sneaking suspension that this is exactly what said author intended, among a zillion other things.<br />Thanks for the journey!	2001-11-10

Terence McKenna was a brilliant raconteur who is sorely missed.

McKenna deserves only credit for the sacred portrayal and placement of the &quot;feminine&quot; in our universe.

A credit to the author is that he does freely admit Kerouac's love (and in fact preference) for beautiful women, but do we as readers really need a diatribe about how wholesome homosexuality is?<br />It's kind of a stretch to blame most of Kerouac's problems on his supposed conflict between hetero and homo leanings. Sexuality seems more a spectrum that is embraced by bisexuals, not a stark decision that must be made on either the &quot;hetero&quot; or &quot;homo&quot; side. Kerouac seemed to revel in his openness, not always torment over it! Obviously gays experienced much discrimination in the fifties and Kerouac probably felt a bit of this tension. Many readers do not need to hear so much about his sexual feelings/behaviors in general and grandiose psychological theories about the underpinnings of his conflicts and genius.<br />The substantive portions on Kerouac's strivings as an artist and goal toward publishing are very well-written and quite informative. I really felt that I was taken into the mind of this ambitious genius beat writer.<br />Amburn's discourses on his closeness to Kerouac did not upset me; they seemed like ingenuous efforts to convey his fondness for Kerouac.<br />The football content was treated thoroughly and reverentially, which I enjoyed. Also, Subterranean sheds much light on the real itinerant nature of Kerouac, his undying love for his mother, and a variety of other tidbits seemingly culled from trusted sources.<br />Mainly the book is intelligently written, engrossing, and the fact that it's pissing off a lot of people would have probably warmed Jack's heart.<br />This book meets my number one criterion for a biography about a person who is no longer with us (if you can ever justify writing one)  - that it is written mostly objectively, and with a lot of respect. This one successfully does just that.<br />I'm raising a glass right now.<br />B. Wallace/author/Labyrinth of Chaosg one)  - that it is written mostly objectively, and with a lot of respect.

The Secret Chief is a fantastically written, conversational and often warm and humorous overview of a real pioneer in the field of psychology. Few researchers or clinicians are willing to boldly sidestep well-known but mostly unfounded restrictions on their practice.<br />The hero of this story is a man that truly put his clients/patients first and upheld their well being as the foremost goal. From his uncanny ability to listen to what they were saying to his courage and wisdom in guiding them along the path toward recovery and growth, the reader is brought in to delightfully pick up on the knowledge gained.<br />Operating not just from a medical expert perspective but from a caring human being equally engaged in the challenge of life, the therapist intuitively, assertively spurs the client onto self discovery and mind expansion. Tools of the psychological trade vary. The respective benefits of varying methods of therapy are discussed, and the trail blazing of supposed &quot;radical&quot; &quot;innovative&quot; methods occurs. That they have ever been explored is impressive. That there is a definite need to continue research and practice in this field is made resoundingly evident within the pages of this remarkable, insightful book.<br />Highly recommended.<br />Brian Wallace, author, Labyrinth of Chaos	2001-09-04

In a world that has increasingly become based on notions of &quot;how to improve your life&quot; written by shady characters who do not exactly exemplify the ideals (signing book deals in a donut shop is a bad start) it is truly refreshing to see someone qualified step up to the plate. In a smoothly flowing educational and entertaining guide on practical steps  toward self-improvement, MS. Lewis talks the talk - and walks the walk. Would you expect anything less from one who is &quot;ballsy&quot; enough to take on such a subject.<br />If you want sound, experientially-based wisdom imparted by someone definitively qualified and uniquely spirited, then buy this book. If you have resigned yourself to a terminal existence of couch potato extraordinaire with french fries growing out of your ears (note aforelisted reviews based on hopelessness) then do not bother.<br />Self empowerment and goal realization never tasted so good.<br />B.

If you treasure the outdated notions that socialism is good for liberals and good for us all then go chew on something else.<br />If you want highly intelligent, incisive delivery of facts and figures and experiential methods for achieving more freedom, then read this book!<br />If you are proud to be an intelligent American or any other creature of independent thought and action, then you must have a copy in your library and read it often.<br />All the best...	2001-06-22

Lovers of language are in for a real feast, as the author weaves a beautiful web of words.<br />The reader takes part in a multifaceted task of understanding the structures of scientific thought and the magical ways in which words dictate what we think. Fuzzy Sets takes place on the borderlands of the intellect, where things are not always as they appear. Explore your thought patterns and the systems of thought that either keep you restrained, or set you free.<br />If you enjoy works that delightfully peel back layers of information to discover what lies beneath, this book will richly satisfy.	2001-06-16

Leary really starts at the very beginning (exceptionally humorously) with his conception in his mother's womb and takes you through his early years as a student, his time at Harvard as an esteemed academic and then up through his \\"retirement\\" years as a stand up comedian/raconteur and lecturer.<br />Each chapter is nicely designed with a mini bio of someone who had impressed Leary and then continues with Leary's take on the various events in his life. There is much self-disclosure here in the form of admitting mistakes, something you certainly do not find a lot of in many autobiographies of conservatives!<br />Leary's writing is lively, intelligent and hopeful - a friendly warning to all drug warriors that it is possible to live a productive, intellectually fruitful life while participating in moderate psychedelic \\"research\\" and consumption.<br />The thing I like best about this work is that it is a hallmark of the true libertarian spirit. Leary smiled quite often during his life despite the fact that the power and control freaks tried to keep him down every day. Leary was a proud humanist and his spirit shall live on in many of us.	2001-06-16
