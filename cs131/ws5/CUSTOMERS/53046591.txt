US	53046591	R3VL4WMIAEA2UH	1402202229	320948130	George Washington's War	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Needs Editing	This book is a solid introduction to the subject, but it needs editing and fact-checking should it go into a second edition.  <br />Here are some examples. <br />When the author discusses Catherine Van Cortlandt's fate, along with that of other Loyalists, her husband is referred to by two different first names in the same sentence, or it could be his name and part of the place name &quot;Morristown.&quot;  It's really confusing.  In defense of the author, it may be an egregious typo; part of the joys of computer-generated text. <br />&quot;Scrip,&quot; i.e. money, is continually called &quot;script.&quot; <br />&quot;Shillings&quot; are called &quot;schillings.&quot;  Maybe the folks at Morristown paid for goods with Austrian money - I don't know. <br />In any case, things like this should have been caught by an editor or proofreader.<br />The author's discussions of leadership and some of Washington's dealings with Loyalists are eerily parallel to events of today and are thought-provoking.  The segment in the book on smallpox and disease and medicine in the Continental Army was especially interesting. Another insightful bit was that on newspapers and Washington's use of them to shape opinion.<br />In conclusion, you'll enjoy the book, but be careful of editing pitfalls.	2004-07-12

This means that there are pictures, statistical information, etc. about different types of locomotives.  You will find extensive coverage on GE and EMD-produced locomotives along with technical data which adds to the presentation.  This is not a book of diesel rosters, however.  For that, you will need to go elsewhere.  Recommended.	2004-05-14

Readers will find crisply printed diagrams, technical information and well reproduced pictures on large-sized pages.  This is not a volume to put on your workbench as it is large.  Since the content is somewhat dated; i.e. you won't find many 2nd generation units in there, I wish Kalmbach would develop and print an updated edition; I know I'd buy it. Highly recommended.	2004-05-14

The end of the title is especially appropriate as Borntrager addresses the decline of the NYC and the machinations leading up to the ill-starred merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad.  Take note, however, that this is not a &quot;railfan&quot; or a &quot;picture&quot;book, rather is Borntrager's story and his views on the railroad industry.  It is fairly easy reading, but gives you a lot to think about.	2003-10-24

The author gives a basic (yet thorough) history of the railroad and describes what it did and how and why it did it.  Thoughtfully selected and captioned pictures supplement the well-written text.  The book includes maps which will provide readers not familiar with the scope and operations of the NH an idea of &quot;what was where when.&quot;  The quality of photo reproduction (color, black and white, sepia)is excellent.  This will be a good addition to your collection of books on railroads in New England.  Also, in this era of drastically overpriced and often indifferently produced railroad books, Lynch's work is refreshingly affordable.	2003-10-24

I was particularly impressed by his ability to present vivid portraits; not only of his buddies, but also of what they did and (as much as can be explained in a book) why they did it.  The author's illustrations are magnificent (The title Visions From a Foxhole is certainly appropriate); two particularly evocative sketches were &quot;Frozen Feet,&quot; and &quot;Dan.&quot;  One caveat to the reader; make sure you have a map of the areas described in the book at hand before you start reading - it will help clarify some of the author's descriptions.	2003-09-26

It is a work to look at again and again whether you are a railfan, traveler, or an artist.  Some of Rose's paintings are romantic evocations of times and places that were found throughout the country not so long ago. Other pictures in the book have an edgier quality to them.  In either case he captures the mood, light, and geographical setting of the never-ending drama of the American railroad.  Rose was a painter who had a technical grasp of the nuts and bolts aspects of his subjects.  He also had good artistic technique - I have found myself coming back to this book repeatedly and asking &quot;how did he do that?&quot;  The quality of printing and binding is excellent and the introductory essay helps to place the paintings in the context of Ted Rose's life.  I have bought several copies of this work as gifts for people and they have all been pleased with it.	2003-05-21

The authors spent a great amount of time gathering material, first-hand anecdotes, charts and other information to present a complete story of the SPs Modoc Line which ran through northeastern California and western Nevada.  The production values and printing quality are typical of Oso Publishings work, in a word - excellent.  The thoughtful selection of maps is a major plus, too, although somehow on one of the maps, California was placed north of Oregon.  At any rate, the place names were correct and it in no way detracted from the text.  The Modoc is no more, of course, but this book is certainly a fitting tribute to one of the lesser known lines of the Southern Pacific.  This work will be of interest to anyone who appreciates western railroading.	2003-05-21

The author's feeling for time, place, and dialogue are outstanding.  Other reviewers have compared Meely to Huckleberry Finn, and they are correct, but I was  reminded of Faulkner in places, particularly in the author's treatment of  Meely's relationship with family.  In addition, some of the comedic scenes  reminded me of sections of Falulkner's book the Rievers.  There are  undercurrents in the novel of serious social issues, too, and Wells does a  very effective job in bringing these forward without preaching, especially  in the parts of the story about Meely, his daddy (I have known folks like  him), and Meely's friend, Chilly.  I hated to see the book come to an end,  but the author has the gift - often lacking in contemporary fiction - of  knowing when to stop.  In conclusion, buy this book, read it, and share it  with friends - it's that good.	2000-03-13

History is only as good as the aids that are included to help the reader understand what the author's trying to say and to place it in some sort of physical context.  Throughout the book the author makes  reference to streets in Galveston.  There's no street map.  He also refers  to photographs.  There are no photographs.  If these materials were such  great sources of inspiration to the author as he claimed they were, then he  could have found a better way to share them with his readers. He does a  very effective job, however, in communicating the horror of the storm, its  aftermath, and the character and personality of Isaac Cline.  Other strong  parts of the book deal with the the bureaucratic inertia and arrogance of  the weather forecasters.  It does not compare to The Pefect Storm or A Wind  to Shake the World (which is unfortunately out-of-print).  Overall, I found  it to be an uneven treatment which read more like a screenplay than a  historical narrative.	1999-09-08

The author does a good job in explaining how (and why) the Pennsylvania RR went about dieselizing its operations.  There's some good information in this volume, especially the sections dealing with the P Company's  management and its relations with locomotive manufacturers and the coal  industry.  The pictures, layout, printing, and general production values  are in keeping with the book's price.<br />Why didn't it get a fifth star?   Simply stated, the text contains typos, errors in classification of  locomotives, and some misleading statements (especially regarding  locomotive testing) which could confuse an unwary reader.  These problems  could - and should - have been caught by careful editing and fact checking  before the volume went to the printer.  Maybe they'll be corrected if the  book goes into a 2d edition.  In any case, I'm anxious to see the promised  2d volume in the set and find out what happens next.	1999-05-07

This is a big, fact-filled book which was commisioned by the PRR to commemorate their centennial.  The text recounts the growth and development of the Pennsylvania Railroad in great detail up to its publication date of  1948.

First, it's not a pictorial history.  Second it provides little information about the day-to-day operations of the NYNH&amp;H.  Finally, anyone looking  for the &quot;romance of the rails&quot; won't find it here.

The author does a very effective job in combining personal recollections, offical histories, and other primary and secondary sources to take the reader from Normandy to Torgau.  In addition, he's not afraid to express his opinion, or to acknowledge his debt to other historians, and to the men and women who were there and shared their stories.  Of particular interest were the sections on medicine, replacement policies, training, and how the US forces adapted to constantly changing situations on the battlefield.  This reader came away with a strong sense of how difficult it was to fight a coalition war against a determined foe. I strongly recommend this work to anyone, veteran or not, who desires an &quot;insider's&quot; view of the ground war in the ETO.	1998-01-09

Many people don't know what train travel was like in the days before Amtrak and this will be an eye-opening book for them.  For those of us who do recall Pullman travel, and the people (many of them friends) who worked the cars, this book will bring back meny memories.  Readers should be aware that that this collection of oral histories is not a railfan's book or a wallow in nostalgia.  These men tell what it was like not only to work for the Pullman Company, but also what life was like for them away from the trains.  Parts of the book are funny, and others are heartbreaking, but most work is that way.  The only thing that kept the book from receiving a &quot;10&quot; rating was that it could have used some car diagrams (floor plans) to give the novice an idea of the interior layout of the cars described in the text.	1997-10-15

These two factors, combined with a lack of other source material led to Edward Longacre's initial reluctance to begin researching this biography.  His reverence for the book The Killer Angels, and his service as a technical advisor to Sam Elliott (who played Buford in the movie Gettysburg), combined to help him overcome his fears. The result is this 248-page biography.  The book has many strong points.  Longacre clearly describes Buford's dealings with the politics of the Army of the Potomac - especially his rise to command after being closely affiliated with three disgraced generals: Pope, Burnside, and Hooker.  He does well in conveying a sense of Buford's growing disillusionment as the Army of the Potomac missed many opportunities to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia after Gettysburg.  The chapter on Gettysburg is probably the best in the book as it gives the reader a good insight into the problems faced by a Civil War general on the field who had to assess terrain and eploy his troopers to take advantage of the ground while trying to anticipate the probable actions of the enemy.    The book is well-produced, has an extensive bibliography, and good maps - even though the typography is sometimes jarring.  People looking for an exhaustive &quot;tell-all&quot; biography will not find it here because of the lack of primary source material to work with.  Within these limits, though, Edward Longacre has written a worthwhile book about a long-neglected commander.	1997-03-12
