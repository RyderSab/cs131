We are taught that project management is a sequential discovery process where cost, time and results are traded off as required; when you do not have the time (the Axis powers may get the bomb first) and you have no idea even if it will work but you have to proceed, the management issues are beyond the experience of most of us. The process needed 10,000 tons of copper when there was none to spare, so they &quot;borrowed&quot; more than 10,000 tons of silver from the US Treasury and melted it down to wire for the magnets in the separation processing. Every apparent dead end was overcome with staggering and imaginative solutions - it provides a great learning aid for all project managers.	2004-08-02

This is a good read for those who want to know how cycles come and go in the economic world and how those in the right place at the right time with shaky ethics and/or poor strategic skills can get filthy rich. The sheer stupidity of investors, bankers and &quot;yes men&quot; employees is stagering and worth the price of the book just for this alone.	2003-08-05

The interviews are ace and remarkable in their clarity and insight. These are let down by the lack of context as to the battle within the wider campaign and a map or two would have enabled the reader to see the landscape and the positions, both would have added to the understanding of the action taken by each of the medal winners. Another example is the cover photo, listed as US Army coming ashore on Tinian Island in the Pacific Islands, which is sort of correct but Tinian is one of the northern Mariana islands (next to Sapian which was a major Marine victory) and was the home of the 509th Bomb Group which lead the atomic raids on Japan, a small detail yet one that would context this good book even better.	2003-08-05

This book has some value but it is jumbled up with a lot of that mumbo jumbo that people in HR use when they have little to add to a discussion. <br />Most employees are not owners and will never really behave (work hard) like owners - they talk much about loyalty and responding to good practices but experience tells me that when it comes to the choice of a midnight session to complete a presentation, most will have an excuse (got to take the cat to the vet) and those that stay will want two days off as their matching reward while telling you for the next year how hard they work.<br />This book sides with the employees as being open to great things so you just have to treat them as per their instructions.<br />Yes in some cases, employees will meet the expectations.  But mostly they will let you down, as does this book.	2003-05-22

I rarely (well outside Michael Porter's early books) say this but I am serious.<br />By page 40, (and it was a winter Saturday night) I had already used the information to start sending emails to my team on the insights into how people see ideas about products rather than how they communicate to you about these same products. Our memories are open to change and while we use words to tell each other about products, we think and decide in metaphors which like memories are open to change and enhancement. <br />This is a clever book of insights. They are presented for you to assess but not overly presented such that you get the idea and your answer (or their guess) on the same page. It assumes a critical and able reader, and it needs imagination to secure the best out of of the book.<br />Well worth the cost and I suggest you will read it several times.	2003-05-22

Business books have only two uses - one that we purchase to read on a long flight (and never read past page 10) and those that we can use over and over to create a spark in your thinking when solving business problems. This is in the second category.<br />It is not a true text book if that is your desire or need. It is more a long list of ways that business people have come up with to run their busineses better. I would not read it for any academic insights (Don does not even define what competitive advantage really is made up from), rather to open your mind to potential ways to break out of the everyday approaches that we feel so safe using.<br />It's worth the investment as one of those books that you keep in reserve for when you have a deadline and need some one to tell you what may be a solution to your problem.	2003-05-22

This is the first book I have read about grocery where the battle between manufacturer and retailer is examined for the dirty little war that it really is - too many pass over this as just another compeitive issue, when it is a fight that will see one side losing big time.<br />Buy a copy and keep it a secret - you will appear to have mastered the major strategic issues in grocery, this book is that good.<br />The issues are examined in a balanced way and the conclusions are well drawn. Be warned, it takes time to read as every three or four pages gave me so many ideas that I would put it down and write a paper inside my business from the ideas and options the book had generated.<br />Well worth the cost, but keep this between just us.	2003-01-04

Any book that can provide you with one insight is worth whatever the author wants in exhange - and that is in part the core value of this book.<br />The authors formalise the need to reduce the Why people purchase a product down to the core value the buyer perceives - the first or second given reason is often not the case and the reality is often more about personal irrationality (who needs a Porsche yet they sell the annual production at full price) rather than reasons that can be easily tabulated. Too much marketing is written about these top level issues and miss what this book identifies.<br />However, while many of their examples appear relevant to the point they are making, they focus on the good fit between the idea (easy to install new computer) and that these were (for the moment) winning ideas, and leave the exploration of the lower level value out of their analysis, the one thing they stress in the best part (the first two) chapters of the book.<br />One very good item is where they provide details of their personal contact details to encourage feedback - you do not see that often enough. Another is telling about failures with all the details, some consultants tell you the names of their successes but talk about the failures (and then only of others) in only the general.<br />I would suggest you puchase this book - it is not the definitive platform (that say Porter's Competitive Advantage is) about creating value; it does raise and examine relevant issues in creating value, particularly for service industries.	2003-01-04

This is quite a good book if a little over written - some of the key points could be made in less space. The core arguments are well presented and supported by some clever analysis and related knowledge.<br />It does not provide a ready made answer to the issue of what and where makes creativity or creates wealth - it does provide logical and detailed evidence and reference points that are valuable to allow you to make your own decisions. More than worth the cost if you ever have to make decisions on where to locate a business or your family, or want to make changes to your local community that is not creating the wealth that makes any place a better place to live.	2002-10-31

I read the three reviews on this book and they are all correct to some extent. It is a refreshing book but presented without a clear thread to their proposition; it does formalise how new ideas move from the cult fringe to mainstream everyday but does not provide a model of how this can be used; it does provide &quot;outside the square&quot; thinkers with a purposeful justification of their right to want to implement new ideas, but it does leave a lot of insights short of the &quot;so what&quot; end point.<br />If you are someone who likes working in the unclear world of the creative ground breaker, this is a book worth having. If you are afraid of losing or quiting your job for an idea, then leave this alone - it is not your cup of tea at all.<br />The creative will find the layout challenging but will probably ignore the dead ends and enjoy the journey through the ideas and examples. Worth the money if you are the deviant thinker in the team - you know who you are because all the other people are normal and just want to do the job that the boss wants and you want to deliver what the boss (and the customer) really needs.	2002-10-31

I was after a book on business leadership with serious analysis of what works backed up by case examples - this is NOT it.<br />This is a good book for new leaders - it tells all the things that can go wrong and how you can work your way through the maze of other people and other agendas.<br />Its definitely not a new &quot;Make It Happen&quot; (John Harvey Jones) which is what I wanted and expected.<br />It is heaps of sociology and everyday examples, not a guide to the insights that make people follow you through those long entrepreneurial days and nights of hard work, near zero pay and share options in the distant future.

Knowing how things come together allows us to better see solutions.<br />The best section is the Pareto Optimum - nature is not democratic and 50/50 outcomes are the exception so never expect the law of averages to help you - it does not work that way.<br />A very good read - those with a science background will get the most out of it but that is not critical.	2001-11-13

This is a good book to get you thinking about the need to really remain relevant to your customer - and they change in their own ways to suit themselves (and not us as sellers).<br />There are the usual smart consultants points of annoyance - they tell stories about people tearing clothes on airplanes and how badly they were treated, but never offer a suggestion as to how they would have fixed the problem - some are so bad that a workable solution may have not been possible.<br />I once faxed one of the authors (in 1998) a request for his views on my comment on one of his published trade magazine articles (used the fax number in the item) and never got an answer, so no one is perfect after all.<br />This is worth a read - the answers are not obvious and it is more a prompter to get you thinking.

Mud, constant risk, brilliant officers and idiot officers, support between small groups to achieve a larger objective - it's all in this book.<br />I suspect in spite of all the horror, he has left some out as just sometimes you can see how some of his leaders are so stupid in their orders (when he knows the impending disasterous result from previous failures) that more expedient short cuts were applied.<br />You feel for these guys by the end of their 62 days of constant rain, mud, digging foxholes to find rotting corpses at the bottom of the hole, and hidden, constant and deadly Jap fire on Okinawa (and over 20,000 casualties) when some rear echelon officer orders them to collect all the brass shellcases and bury the dead Japs.<br />Get a copy, read it and get as many others to read this as possible.

This book is the closest I have read in delivering a practical understanding of how to tear apart the supply chain in your industry and re-assemble it to better deliver value to your customers.<br />It does provide  real emphasis on getting to know what the customer wants and then working  to deliver this - first, second and last.<br />That said, the authors do then  readily accept what the currently successful players tell them about how  they did thier customer alignment. There is very little on HOW you can  learn do do the same.<br />There is no critical assessment of how (say)  Gateway have been right or WHY they are right today and if this is  sustainable into the future. There is a lot of positive words about how  well it works, but the assessment (to me) is very rear view mirror -  telling what has happened and why we think it works, not drilling down to  real customers and explaining what they took out as value from their buying  experience.<br />This is a great book to inform an experience reader as to new  possibilities - if you are new to supply chain thinking, do not start here,  this assumes a high level of base knowledge and skills. If you want a solid  foundation, read Michael Porter (Competitive Advantage) and Kuglin  (Customer Centered Supply Chain Management) then come back to this book.  And then get a blank sheet of paper to list out how your industry value  chain can be re-written from the existing industry supply chain and then  you are on the way to finding competitive advantage.<br />I would be  interested in your thoughts - ingenuity@onthe.net.au	2000-07-16

Fair enough.<br />The other reviewers have made my point - this  is a checklist not the answer. Reality varies by case and there are no  automatic recipes for success - no book has that.<br />And the cases they use  - well they are successfull today but there is no reason why this will  remain the case.<br />Success for the authors is a high share price, but this  is as much an estimate of economic lotto (ie greed and guessing at future  share values) as it is an estimate of actual sustainable business  viability. <br />Be wary of their &quot;economic dynamics framework&quot; -  those of us who remember &quot;environmental accounting&quot; and the 100s  of other odd ways of counting up value, can tell you that ultimately  management accounting has survived because it tells you what it costs of  make, sell and what margin is left over - not a wooly idea that has  subjective elements in its' foundation logic.<br />For anyone looking for a  new direction or inspiration, this is a great starting point. <br />If you  want to make a real difference, go back to first principles, read Michael  Porter's Competitive Advantage (1985) from end to end (do not skip the hard  stuff after page 100) and you will have a framework of how value is created  within firms and industries.<br />There are no shortcuts, and no recipes -  only guideposts for leaders.	2000-06-11

This book proves it.	2000-05-28

However, this is overcome  by the sound way in which Gale seeks to assist us in finding ways to drive  value for the customer.<br />Worth the investment - it does require some  effort to read, but most worthwhile books are like that.	2000-05-28

This book is good for any manager under 40 who has not seen all the fads last time they came around, or has not taken the trouble to read the thicker and more rigorous text books on strategy.<br />It is thin - value  chain is not in the index, and customers (satisfaction) are only listed  once - how can you seek ways to improve your market position without a  detailed ( = quantitative) review of where you sit in the value chain or to  know exactly what the customer wants (rather than what you can tart up from  the current catalogue.<br />It's a good checklist - otherwise it would have  been just two stars.<br />Other Trout books are very good - this one appears  to be harvesting the reputation rather than adding to it.	2000-05-28

There is no recognition of the customer, there is total focus on the  process.<br />I would seek out a copy in the library and check that this  against my requirements, then buy a copy if it suits - it is great at what  it is, a summary of the TOC approach - but as a business development tool,  it's more of a loss.	2000-05-28

It's a waste of space as far as a text book to assist anyone in business -  it's a first year university book for liberal arts time wasters.	2000-02-12

This book goes beyond a retelling of the event - you can synthesise for yourself that Neil Armstrong was the only person who could be trusted with the responsibility of bringing the Apollo program to the required results -  &quot;to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth&quot;.<br />And  this inherent skill as a cool engineer still shows through today. He just  gets on with the job and has set the event in a perspective that records  the acheivement without demanding a place of honour for himself. Frank  Borman was the only other choice and he passed over having his fame assured  with the Earthrise photograph coming from his mission.<br />You will read how  the others that followed did not have the required detachment - some went  off chasing religious shadows, others never fitted the event into getting  on with the next thing in their life.<br />The Apollo 13 movie in part makes  the point that the world had become bored with spaceflight - this is more  the fault of the screw ups on Apollo 12 than anything else. Why you would  give two navy flyers the responsibility is difficult for even the author to  cover off - they destroyed the colour TV camera the instant they started to  use it, so no live pictures and thus the inevitable public turn off and  thus the loss of public interest in the Apollo program. <br />This is a great  book - more for the way it shows the inner resoucefulness and cool decision  making skills of Borman and Armstrong, and the nearly as good skills of the  others.<br />It's a great read.	1999-12-11

The title was a worry when I ordered it but on the strength of the readers' comments, I pressed on. I am glad I did.<br />This is a great book - the author is not a great wordsmith but you can feel his fear (and the fun)  in every page even in his simple prose.<br />The reality of the days comes  through in every mission - random death was ever present on every mission -  yet they went out without demanding anything other than the gratitude of  their country.<br />The author is not sufficiently honoured by the title, but  he is well honoured by his deeds and his breezy recall of their context.	1999-05-10

A great read for modern business - the key insight is that Ideas are Free - it costs nothing to have a great, marketing dominating IDEA. You just need the right people and the right circumstance - pity that most firms  have too few right people and run an operation that does not provide ideas  with the best possible opportunity to live and grow.<br />If your assets  (people and their knowledge) walk out the door every evening, this is a  great book to awake you to the need to provide the reasons for them to come  back tomorrow morning !<br />The only problem is that all of this is in the  first 60% of the book - the rest is a collection of assorted stuff to fill  up the required space.<br />Worth a read - try to borrow a copy - buy a copy  if this option fails - it is worth the investment.	1999-02-21

I  compared this to my ten years in Shell, where bright people are taken out  of the line around 30-34 to work with the leaders of the firm which then  cuts them off from where the blood is invested, out in the field.<br />As a  piece of history, it shows how a &quot;can do&quot; culture can so easily  march full speed into a deep bottomless bog from which escape is  impossible. This applies to both business and the military.<br />As a case  study, Coles Myer Corporation in Australia has the same &quot;can do&quot;  culture that shoots first and perhaps thinks second - from my two years  there in 1990-1992. Retailers are too easy to draw into a battle where  someone else makes the rules and choses the battleground, just as the NLF  did in Vietnam.<br />Read this book if you ever want to manage anything at all  well, and despair at what was wasted in terms of people and opportunity  Westmoreland and his fellow travellers of defeat.	1999-01-23

So do not buy it if you are looking for a complex set of answers.<br />But please buy it if you are starting to think  that some of your problems, or more importantly some of your opportunities,  are some how linked to the way in which your business operates.<br />Not  business is an island so we depend on others who thus bring variation and  their own shortfalls into our business, even though we may not see this  when we are so close to every day decision making.<br />The table 1.2 is the  simplest decsription I have ever seen as to the 9 types of supply  relationships.<br />A practical book, soft cover so not overtly pretentious,  and good value for those who can use some ideas to create their own.	1998-11-05

Many managers have a copy of this book on their book shelf - most have read the first 40-50 pages but no more. This is a shame (there is great value in the second half) but understandable as there are few examples and  the text build on itself so working through the copy requires continual  focus.<br />There are almost zero recorded applications of the entire value  chain approach in the literature - either the results are too valuable or  it is too difficult - I am not sure which one is the case.<br />My PhD is on  the use of value chains which are realigned to how the customer values the  results (in FMCG supermarkets) then how each precursive step can be then  optimised to suit the customer value equation. It is almost a line of best  fit as optimising one step always impacts on the other steps - just as  Heisenberg said for managing both location and velocity of things.<br />Great  book - read it from end to end or you will not get the true benefits. What  it needs is a second book that brings the cases to life with real world  examples - you will have to wait for my book for that bonus.	1998-11-05

If you have a complex realignment of the business to deliver, this is good  value.<br />However, there is NO direction as to HOW to determine the needs of  the customer in terms that will fit the value/supply chain factors.<br />The  direction to do this is paramount in the book, but alas there is not much  on how to find and assess customer value determinants in ways that these  can fit the supply chain drivers.<br />My PhD is on this need to retro fit  customer value to a supply chain - I got a few good set up quotes but no  direction as to how to make it happen.	1998-11-05

For those management accountants who feel less than totally appreciated  (the real ones will know this to be a common feeling) then this book shows  how financial accounting usurped management accounting when the bean  counters went looking for shareholders and needed to tell less than the  truth about what was going on inside their firms.<br />If auditors are just  hookers with a degree, then financial accountants are then just politicians  without a cause - you cannot run a business on late and averaged data from  the financial perspective.<br />This book reminds us that knowing what things  cost to make and cost to sell is what keeps a firm on the black ink side of  the ledger.<br />Worth a read.	1998-08-13
