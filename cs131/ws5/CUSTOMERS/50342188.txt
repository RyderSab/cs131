She has become one of my favorites.  <br />Ian and Sabrina were practically raised together while Ian was being tutored and trained under her father.  Ian, a Highlander, was bethrothed to Margaret, a Lowlander and Sabrina's sister.  Ian was a constant thorn in her side, as most big brothers and cousins are most times, except, neither Ian nor Sabrina realized that their constant bickering was really a sign of puppy love that soon blossomed into an enchanted love.  But this only came about due to Margaret's mysterious disappearance the day before the wedding.  Nevertheless, a &quot;Promise Given is a Promise Kept&quot; and Ian married the very reluctant Sabrina in Margaret's place.  But ah, the plot thickens.  Is Margeret truly dead and if so, who murdered her?   Does Ian have enemies and spies abiding in his castle?  Read the book to discover the answers to these questions and many more!!	2001-04-04

I was more than disappointed in the Pretender even though I spent a mere $ .50 cents for the purchase of the book.<br />My first Rosalyn West to read, the beginning captured my interest even though I found the text slow moving.  Deacon Sinclair, Confederate spy disguises himself as a wounded Union soldier to gain the symphathy and confidence of Garnet Davis, whom holds the key to an impregnable morse code.  <br />Deacon seduces Garnet in the name of duty and leaves to fulfill his mission; leaving a child and a thirst for revenge with Garnet.<br />Four years later, Deacon is forced to sell his home to a wealthy carpetbagger because of unpaid taxes and opens his door to meet the new owners, Garnet Davis, spouse and child.  Thus the vengeful game begins with Garnet lowering Deacon to a mere store clerk in her employ.  But Deacon, in spite of his station, senses the deceitful game being played against Garnet and protects her from the possible pain.  <br />At times this book was downright boring but toward the end I was sitting on the edge of my seat.  I just wish it was that way throughout the book!!	2001-04-04

This book was so disappointing I had to force myself to finish.  Meagan McKinney has never disappointed me this way (well, My Wicked Enchantress was pretty bad).<br />Noel Magnus, a newspaper tycoon, eludes his inner demons by traipsing across the artic looking for a missing explorer and a mystical opal, while wooing and seducing Rachel, the proprietor of a saloon on Herchel Island.  <br />Noel promises love but not marriage.  Rachel longs for warmer climates, residence in a house with a white picket fence and being adorned in dresses worn by Godby's models; and nights of passion, but after the ring is installed on her finger.  But Noel believes Rachel is protected from a cruel society by remaining in the Artic.  He's promising nothing but frigid temperatures and licentious affair.<br />Thus Rachel sets out to resolve the problems herself by creating the widow of Noel Magnus, whom New Yorkers'presume to be dead. But while the widow inherits wealth, respectibility, and comfort, she also inherits the haunting secrets of the Magnus family and must fight to conquer Noel's demons with love and understanding or lose both herself and Noel to what she considers a 'life without a life'.<br />On a personal note, Noel was brooding, depressing, and downright abusive.  I found nothing heroic, sensual or strong about this man.  Yes, he loved the outdoors and was an expert in Artic expeditions, but a polar bear exhibited more warmth and affection than Noel, and polar bears are flesh eaters!!<br />Happy readers!!	2000-12-16

Boy, is the title wrong for this novel.  <br />Olivia Granville is an astute scholar with no designs for marriage or love, having little regard for the political turmoil surrounding her.  But Olivia's life changes during a fall from a cliff into the arms of an artist, physician, smuggler, pirate, and spy wrapped in a virile masculinity.  <br />From then on, Olivia plays the dangerous game of intrique, intercepting information, and struggles with loyalty to those she loves.<br />While this novel promises action and intrique, I found little if anything to keep me occupied and interested enough to finish.  But alas, finish I did and was highly disappointed!!  Olivia's character was unseemingly out of place and what little personality she did have was dry and naive.  Anthony, our relunctant hero, was dashing and exciting; reminding me of the late Tyrone Power in one of his dashing pirate movies of the 1940s.  And I couldn't understand what Anthony saw in Olivia (o.k., cliche of the year)!!<br />This is not a 'happily ever after' and the political turmoil takes a true but deadly turn during England's struggle for civility.<br />Anthony, unlike most romance pirate figures, has no great wealth,  title or land to inherit and therefore, lives and probably dies a pirate's death by hanging.  <br />As for the other characters in the book, Phoebe, Portia, and their husbands were not true to the era and I found each somewhat out of date (before their time), making it difficult to believe their stories or making it interesting enough to backtrack and read their stories.  (I find it hard to accept a teenage girl falling in love with her best friend's father - American Beauty anyone?)	2000-12-13

My favorite at this point until Quick weaves another tale to capture that title of favorite in my library.<br />Cute story with strange twist!  Olympia Wingfield studies ancient artifacts while raising three young hellions whom masquerade as nephews.  Olympia (during her free time) is searching for clues found in a diary  which leads to hidden pirate treasure.  <br />But alas, someone else is searching for the diary and treasure also, and his name is Jared Chillhurst, future earl and descendant of pirates whom is 'all that with a Coke and a bag of chips on the side'.  Jared delivers the diary that Olympia's uncle recovers to her, hoping that Olympia will translate the poetic justice written in the diary.  But Jared is baffled as to how to approach Olympia and gain her trust.  But once he enters her chaotic home of unruly boys and dog, and encounters a housekeepers whom keeps house about as much as Benson kept house on the 70s t.v. show 'Benson' (whom was always lounging around drinking iced tea), Jared immediately uses quick wit and poses as the desperately necessary tutor for the boys with verbal references from Olympia's uncle.  Of course, he is deceiving her while gaining her trust, eliminating embezzelers, rescuing abducted nephews, making passionate love to her, and all while solving mysteries of his own.<br />But it is Olympia whom discovers that there is yet another interested but dangereous party searching for the diary and pirate treasure.  <br />Move over Miss Marple, Olympia Wingfield is to be reckoned with!<br />You'll laugh, sigh, cry, and just plain enjoy 'Deception'.  <br />Happy Readings!!!	2000-10-21

Like most romance readers, I have my favorites and I am leary to dive into unfamiliar territory, but when reading Quick, I realized I had dived into a writer with a passion for life!  I am an avid fan of historicals; history is my life, intrique and battles, are in my blood.  But Quick's novels are of a slower pace and sometimes I need a slower pace to relax and unwind from the busy life of teaching, mothering, homeschooling, soccer mom (whom travels (out of state) with her son's select soccer team and all the other day to day stressful activities.  Slower than what I'm used to, but never boring.<br />Amanda Quick is one of my favorites!!	2000-10-13

Marcus, Earl of Chase has inherited the earldom after his cousins and  uncle die, leaving no other male heir, thus the estate is entailed to  Marcus.  Marcus relunctantly accepts the earldom and the responsibility of  his 'bastard' cousin, the Dutchess, illegitimate daughter of his deceased  uncle. <br />But Marcus finds that his earldom is in jeopardy unless he  marries his cousin, the cold and aloof Dutchess.  Yes, Marcus will own the  entire estate and all of its riches; but there is just one problem, Marcus  hates the Dutches.  <br />I may be cynical, but this supposedly romance novel  was anything but romantic.  Marcus was emotionally and mentally abusive, so  much so that I found myself crying for the Dutchess (Josephina).  How she  found the courage or possibly the stupidity to actually marry Marcus and  put up with his abusive antics is beyond me.  Well, it is not totally  beyond me.  We woman today put up with more than she did with Marcus for  less than a fortune.  Maybe that is why I found this novel depressing, less  than amusing, and downright frightening to think that others considered  this novel a love story!!	2000-09-07

Exciting, exhilirating, and sensitive.   Captive will have you in tears, routing for the Native Americans that were  so brutally decimated in Florida for land; but will also have you grieving  for the innocents murdered in revenge. You will applaud the strength of  leaders such as Osceola and understand their Native American's strength to  endeavor.  Graham's ability to capture the essence of the inner strength of  the Seminoles is applauded!!<br />If you are not familiar with the Florida  McKenzies', I suggest that you start at the beginning of Graham's  sensational series, 'Runaway'.  'Runaway' introduces Jarrett McKenzie,  James's brother and explains the relationship between the McKenzies and the  Seminole Nation.   'Captive' picks up the story of James McKenzie and gives  historical details of the 1830s decimation of the Seminole Nation;  and  'Rebel' allows us to see baby Ian, Jarrett's son, as a full-grown replica  of his father fighting the Civil War in his marriage bed, while 'Surrender'  introduces James eldest son, Jerome, fighting the Civil War on sea, land,  prison and in love.  Following is 'Glory', Jarrett's second son, Julian, a  skilled and talented physician, and 'Triumph', continuesand ends the story  of both Jarrett's and James youngest headstrong daughters and their  relunctant marriages to opposing Civil War soldiers.  And if you enjoy the  McKenzies, why I believe you'll enjoy the Camerons in 1. Sweet Savage Eden,  2. A Pirate's Pleasure, 3.  Love Not a Rebel, 4. One Wore Blue, 5. One Wore  Gray, 6.

However, the Heir did not inherit neither the romance nor action  usually associated with Lindsey's earlier novels.  <br />Actually, it was so  'boring' that I had to literally force myself to finish the novel.  <br />The  hero and heroine were 'weak' characters and the menace, 'dear old' Ophelia  was obnoxious and dizzy, oh well, as she was written to be.

However, like most Lindsey  conclusions, there were no fireworks, no 'guns a blastin', no climax to  keep you enthralled, just a simple 'I Love You' from the heroine to the  hero, whom never confessed his love either.

Simon and Daphne are trying to accomplish the inevitable during the 'season'; she trying to finally catch a wealthy husband and he, trying to avoid all those looking for wealthy husbands.   But alas, they find each other make a bargain which will enable the other  to fulfill their goals for the season, however, neither considered falling  in love part of the bargain.  Towards the end it became somewhat 'sappy'  but still enjoyable.  I especially loved Daphne's brothers and their plan  to wreak havoc on her marriage, however, I would love to see her brothers  in love stories of their own.  Simon eventually became a senseless bore and  again, it proved that 'women' rule when Daphne's psychology opened Simon's  mind, eyes, and heart.	2000-06-04

Personally, I disliked both the hero and heroine.  Yes,  the book contained the usual Virginia Brown wit and humor and of course the  spunkiest strong-willed heroine ever penned.  She was an archeologist and  anthropoligist rolled into one; sort of a female Indiana Jones, however,  famed Indiana Jones whip and hat could not best Cordell, Indian friend and  foe, scout and gunslinger.  Even with the few laughs that Cordell managed  to pull out of me, I found it very difficult, well, to tell the truth, I  found it quite easy to dislike this hero.  He was abusive, callous,  sarcastic, and downright evil in my personal opinion.  And I'm no fan of  'sappy love stories'.  I like a dominant hero whom is strong in character,  however, I found Cordell, strong in stupidity.  He was too loud, too  boastful and too outspoken.  He definitely WAS NOT the strong silent  type.<br />Happy readings!	2000-05-12

Normally, I'm a historical romance reader, however, this one by Lisa Kleypas had me captivated.  Though totally not original, the writer keeps the readers engrossed with the pain, anguish and resentment the characters feel for their situation.   However, both are strong willed, independent, and determined to battle to  the end to have their way, in other words, a typical romance novel written  well enough to be 'oh so entertaining'.  If you're a thespian, you'll love  'Somewhere I'll find you', if you're a hopeless romantic, you'll love  'Somewhere I'll Find You', and if you're a historical buff like myself,  read and enjoy it for the change and variety!	2000-05-01

This novel is witty, comical, and downright 'old fashioned'.  The plot is cute, hero impersonating someone he truly isn't, and the heroine is taking lessons on how to find a husband, (a rich husband) and doesn't know that her instructor fits the category!  The  heroine is witty, brass, opinionated, and 'clumsy' to say the least.  The  hero is typically arrogant, tall, handsome, mysterious, and of course,  richer than the Queen of England.  The love was genuine, not oversexed and  lust filled.  That was refreshing!   Ironically, I read this book is one  sitting.  Even though the plot did not contain a murder mystery, a devious  blackmail, etc., I was able to remain interested and engrossed for one  entire evening to finish the book.  A fan of historical novels including  intrique, action, murder, and of course, passionate encounters, I  considered this novel 'off my beaten path' but found myself wanting to read  more of this particular author that I only just discovered through a  library loan.	2000-04-07

And the Amerian Civil War is my favorite era of history.  'Triumph' has the reader  swimming through the crystal clear waters of Florida seeking safety and  escape from the enemy; or dodging bullets while trying to save the lives of  men from both armies; and grasping for air while surrounded by a blazing  forest fire.  Yes, 'Triumph' has it all.  Strong willed heroines; arrogant,  overbearing but protective heros; and the usual witless deceitful villains.   The numerous stories within the novel could be the makings of a  mini-series.  Sometimes I felt as if the readers were rushed into  relationships, however, with 'Triumph' being the last of the saga, all  characters had to find love for a lifetime or remain a mystery to the  readers.  If you have no interest in history, don't bother reading this  book, but if you're a history buff, enjoy this Civil War novel set not in  Virginia or the deep south, but in and around the coast of Florida!	2000-04-07

This being my first 'Dodd' novel to read (after owning many through used book store purchases) gave me the incentive to complete the reading.   However, I disliked many of the characters!   Many were shallow, self  centered, deceitful and witless.  Even the hero and heroine were not my  favorite characters.  I found the heroine annoying, constantly transforming  mentally to the housekeeper she physically masquerades behind.  The hero  was anything but heroic!  However, after many bungled attempts to locate an  item which the entire book is based upon, the hero and heroine realize  their attraction for each other and accept their fate (strategically  planned fate of course) of becoming lovers in matrimonial bliss!   While  Dodd's writing style may not be my personal favorite (being a fan of REAL  historical romances), I will indulge myself in reading one of her novels  when desiring a change of pace.	2000-04-07

Three books in one for the price of $1.00 at a library sale. Excellent hardback, original wrapper included.  All exciting, spellbinding (capturing the readers and holding their  interest with an intense of having to finish the book in one reading) and  sensual in the Heather Graham fashion. The heros are similar yet unique in  their individuality, exuding strength, leadership, integrity, compassion,  and devotion to causes and loved ones. The three heros represent the  founders of our great nation, while the heroines represent the women whom  stood beside him, fought with and against him and provided the wind beneath  his wings. If you enjoyed reading these three novels, continue to read  about their great, great, great offsprings, the Camerons of 'One Wore Blue,  One Wore Gray and One Rode West' and you will understand why the Camerons  are one of my favorite 'Graham' families	2000-02-04

After reading 'Henley's 'Pirate and the Pagan, Raven and the Rose, and the Falcon and the Flower', I found that 'Hawk and Dove' scored the same as 'Dragon and Jewel' on my 'read again only if on a remote island and there  are no natives to talk to'. Virginia Henley is one of my favorite authors!  I loved all the characters in the three novels mentioned above, however, as  I stated in reviewing 'Dragon and Jewel', I was disappointed by 'Henley',  but alas, I own 'Pirate and Pagan (disapproved of the adultery plot), Raven  and Rose, and Falcon and Flower', and they are my cherished 'dime store  purchases'. Maybe I disliked this novel because at the time I was reading  'Hawk and the Dove', I kept thinking, if that was my husband cheating on me  with me, I would slip poison in his wine goblet	2000-02-04

I've read reviews regarding the follow-up to 'Princess of Fire', 'Knight of Fire' and was disappointed to find that many readers considered 'Knight of Fire' 'boring' and 'unexciting'. However, 'Princess of Fire' opens with  a fierce battle later called the Battle of Hastings and the inevitable  capture of the king's daughter, Princess Fallon. Hence begins the attempt  to bend or break the strong willed courageous princess, however, sparks  flew between the then Lady Fallon and Count Alaric long before the Battle  of Hastings. Shannon Drake/Heather Graham remains true to her nature in  capturing your attention with an exciting and gut wrenching opening and  then later leads you through a someone mediocre history of the hero and  heroine's entwined lives that eventually catapults at the Battle of  Hastings. The heroine is considered to be so courageous and determined to  avenge her father's death, rid her beloved country of the invading Normans  and restore the crown to an English head, that she is actually considered a  serious threat to William the Conqueror. But alas, in the end, England is  ruled by the Norman conqueror and the princess is ruled by the conqueror of  her heart. In all, I've rated this particular Shannon Drake novel a 'four  star'. Particularly since this is one Shannon Drake novel that I would  actually purchase, especially after being disppointed with other Drake  novels.	2000-02-04

Unfortunately, to my dismay, both 'All I Desire' and 'Dangerous Man' (the better of the two) are practically identical to Roger's previous bestseller 'Sweet Savage Love'. While there is little 'true' romance in any of these  novels, you will find adventure, intrique, cloak and dagger, and of course,  Roger's love of the southwest terrain and the including of Hispanics and  Native American in the history of the west.  But the novels are too similar  - if you'e read 'Sweet Savage Love', you would conclude that both male  characters from a 'Dangerous Man' and 'All I Desire' could be very close  relatives to Steve Morgan. Personality, attitude, appearance, and of course  their lackluster opinion of love and romance. But one can see that Roger's  has reshaped her more recent male characters into a 1990s appealing hero,  compassionate, considerate, and even loyal at times - while her first  dangerous character - Mr. Steven Morgan was rude, violent, extremely  dangerous and in plain english, a 'whoremonger', whom was a candidate for  AIDS or the venereal diseases common in the 1860s. <br />In comparising  characters, the female characters did not have the zeal or spunk that Jenny  Brandon possessed. While I disagreed with Jenny's permiscuous nature, I  admired her ability to 'survive' in any situation, and she had many  'issues' to deal with. I find that Roger's must have a favorite novel and  'Sweet Savage Love' is her favorite. Well, Rogers, of all your novels, yes  that is my favorite also, however, penning the same cliche's,  circumstances, situations, and plots continually and changing character  names is 'getting old' and boring. Let Jenny and Steve rest in peace and  not found reincarnated in upcoming novels! There will never be another  'Sweet Savage Love'.	2000-02-04

Heather Graham usually pens a more vibrant heroine and hero. Yet for some reason I could not come to terms with Rhiannon. She was 'bland', depicted as etheral, mysterious, yet,  nothing about her character exemplified those traits in the novel. She  constantly wore mourning black even while married to a very live and viral  man. The way Graham describes her, I always seem to picture 'Morticia' of  the 'Adams Family', particualy when Angelica Huston portrayed the character  'Morticia' in the movie. It was very difficult for me to 'like' Rhiannon.  There were several other heroines of Graham writing 'Shannon Drake' that I  didn't particularly enjoy, however, Graham's 'McKenzies' normally married  sensuous Rebel or Yankee 'spitfires', and Rhiannon failed to fit into this  catergory. The novel itself was a combination of several novels. There were  too many stories combined to make up 'Glory'. The story of Jesse and  Sydney, which was introduced in 'Surrender', was fiery enough to create a  novel of their own tumultuous affair. And Jesse's character changed in  'Glory'. In 'Surrender', Jesse was a 'a typical' hero, strong, possessive,  reckless with his own life, but protective of those he cared for. In  'Glory', Jesse seemed 'too young', too soft in my opinion. I kept expecting  him to say to someone that he assisted putting Sydney in 'Old Capitol'  prison to keep her safe during the war and that is where she should have  remained. Yet he claimed he had an undying love for her, but where did it  develop? If I was the author of 'Glory', Sydney and Jesse's affair would  have began the moment he kidnapped her in 'Surrender' and of course, a spin  off of their own novel, commencing with Jesse forcing Sydney to leave  Jerome and her later awaking on his couch after being kidnapped. I failed  to see how sending Brent McKenzie to a veneral disease research center  could be considered interesting enough to the readers. It failed to  interest me. Yes, I'm aware that veneral disease killed many soldiers  during the Civil War and it is still running rampant today, however, a  valuable talented physician wasted his talent being sarcastic to a woman  whom was just as sarcastic to him, while caring for very ill patients, one  of whom was her father! If Brent and Mary are going to be the next major  characters in the McKenzie saga, I can't see where his experience in an  1860s CDC will spin off a romantic sequel. And where is Jennifer? Has she  recovered from grieving for her spouse, or was she on the verge of becoming  slightly mentally unstable - or will she ever experience love and  friendship with a male again. On the positive side, Heather Graham gave  graphic details of the medical units responsibilities and the conditions  that existed during the Civil War. The military strategic maneuvers of both  Generals Lee and Meade were outstanding. And Julien was a likeable hero,  even though he was portrayed harder and colder than either Ian or Jerome.  All and all, 'Glory' lacked the excitement and sensuality of both 'Rebel'  and 'Surrender', but again, gave valuable historical insight into the daily  lives of medical units under fire. My favorite line from the book is where  Ian questioned Julian's position as a physician under fire and Julian  responded, &quot;they shoot at me, I shoot back&quot;!	2000-02-04

A 'one sitting' read! I have very few complaints about this novel, although you experience deja vue if you've read Rosemary Roger's 'Sweet Savage Love',  but you appreciate Rogers writing in the mode that she penned in the 1970s.  Nick Kincaid is 'dangerous', much like his predecessor 'Steve Morgan'. I  say precessor because Steve's appearance in 'Sweet Savage Love' occurred in  the 1970s, set historically during the U.S.Civil War, Mexico's  independence, and the expansion west. Actually, Nick could have been  Steve's father, their lives were so similar. But there are so many  similarities between the two novels that Rosemary probably should have  created Nick Kincaid and Victoria Ryan as Morgan's parents. That would have  been believable! But if you enjoy espionage, Native American scrimages,  historical battles, being on the run, sensual, passionate and sometimes  plain lust lovemaking episodes, then you'll enjoy 'A Dangerous Man'. Rogers  has a five star winner in this one. But mind you, if you enjoy slow moving  romances where the hero and heroine compliment each other with passionate  words and kisses, debutant balls, and lengthy drawing rooms discussions,  this is not the novel for you. This novels keeps you on the edge of your  seat, or pillow, however you read! But if enjoyed 'Sweet Savage Love', in  spite of its controversy, then you'll enjoy 'A Dangerous Man'! On a  positive note regarding the author, Rosemary Rogers has learned to pen  heroines whom are not as permiscuous as some of her 70s heroines. And it  seesm she realizes that rape is not considered romantic!	2000-02-04

I recommend both 'Runaway and Captive' be read  before continuing onto the latter books of the saga in order to understand  the history of the family, the history of the Native Americans whom  inhabited Florida, the love of the brothers, their love for the land, their  families, and their beliefs. Then you'll understand the offsprings, Ian,  Jerome, and Julian and see where each of them received their strength and  compassion and of course, sensual sex appeal.

First, the inside cover was 'mistakenly' placed in 'In Your Arms'.  The inside cover definitely looks like the book takes  place in the American Southwest or West, however, the regoin of the book  takes place in Regency England and early Americana New Orleans.  (I have  yet to find a cactus in New Orleans except in a garden store)!  I found it  very difficult to enjoy, or even like the Holt, the supposedly hero.  He  was sarcastic, mean, vindictive and didn't know the first thing about  romance.  As for Amalie, her parents history I found to be more interesting  than her 'spinsterhood' season in England.  I thought her shallow, and very  naive to say the least.  Plus I felt that I was left to guess the end of  the story.  Like the books my kids read by R.L. Stine, where you determine  the conclusion.  The animosity between Holt and Amalie's brother Kit  Silver, aka Christian Courtland was left unresolved; Amalie and her  brother's differences of opinions were left unresolved - if he loved his  sister so much, why couldn't he accept the fact that she considered herself  in love with Holt, and that is why she placed herself in a precarious  position of being his mistress; and what of Christian?  Did he return to  piracy, or did he become a merchantman and eventually purchase a farm in  Virginia?  Did he eventually marry and have a family of his own, and  maintain contact with his sister.  And did he even return to New Orleans  for his sister?  There were so many unanswered questions that I felt at a  loss when finishing this book.  But true to Rosemary Rogers the book  contained the betrayal,  intrique and espionage that has always fascinated  me.  But not enough for me to give this book no more than two hard earned  stars!	2000-01-31
