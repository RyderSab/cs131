Being adventurous - physically as well as intellectually - was simply expected.<br /><br />No one should pick this book up expecting a conventionally structured, conventionally worded autobiography. Miss Hepburn tells her life's stories as if her readers were sitting down for a visit. She moves through her long life in approximately linear fashion, but she never sticks to a timeline when doing that would keep her thoughts from flowing freely. She's frank without being vulgar, and she describes her own behavior - including those times when it was less than admirable - in forthright, honest terms.<br /><br />An interesting look into the mind and heart of one very interesting person.	2005-10-04

It's authored by one of the four sons Rosanna eventually bore to her Amish husband.<br /><br />Anyone expecting a polished, scholarly study of Amish customs will find this book disappointing, because it's not meant to be anything else but a personal memoir. Approached as such, though, it's both informative and enjoyable. Joe Yoder paints a loving portrait of growing up in an Old Order Amish home, of his orthodox brother Yost's wedding, and of his own journey into a less rigid form of his parents' faith. His editor deliberately kept his grammar and spelling intact, which means that it's sometimes not technically correct; but I found preserving the charm and authenticity of his \\"voice\\" a good decision.<br /><br />If you've read and enjoyed Rosanna of the Amish, you shouldn't miss this follow-up. If not, you can certainly enjoy Rosanna's Boys on its own terms if you've a taste for folksy nonfiction.	2005-09-17

This novel is based on the script for an upcoming theatrical film. Since I always prefer to read the book first if I can, and then see the movie, I was delighted to get my hands on it. But those who want to see the movie without knowing what to expect should NOT be reading this review!<br /><br />With that said, I could certainly tell where the story came from. Joss Whedon's fingerprints are all over it. It's quirky, dark, and intriguing. Some scenes made me squirm and laugh at the same time, which is just what I often did while watching first-run FIREFLY episodes (the film is based, in its turn, on a now defunct Whedon-created TV series). Author DeCandido does a fine job with the characters, who both act and sound like themselves at all times. He's also good at writing action scenes, which matters because this story's action rarely quits.<br /><br />The premise? (I'm writing this review backwards - oh, well.) In the far future, humans have used up the resources of \\"Earth that was\\" and have found another solar system to colonize. They've been able to terraform some forty worlds in that system, planets and moons ranging from the highly civilized \\"core\\" to the outer \\"black\\" where savage space-going cannibals called Reavers roam. Captain Malcolm Reynolds, survivor of a civil war in which his side lost, has gathered a motley crew aboard an old Firefly-class cargo ship that he's named Serenity in honor of the war's last and most terrible battle. They live on the edges of civilization, moving from world to world and keeping their ship supplied by carrying legitimate cargoes and carrying out not-so-legitimate jobs. Their lives are complicated by Mal's allowing Serenity to shelter a pair of fugitives: Dr. Simon Tam and his sister, River, whom Simon rescued from captivity in a \\"school\\" where Alliance scientists performed ghoulish experiments on the brilliant young students. During the eight months since the Tams came aboard, River's erratic behavior has run the gamut from odd to downright dangerous. But she never before did the things she does in a bar on a remote moon, that alarm Captain Mal into chaining her up - and that soon have him flying Serenity to places he never would have believed he'd be willing to go.<br /><br />Sardonic space opera at its best, crossed with post-Civil War western.vior has run the gamut from odd to downright dangerous.

In 1431, the convent of St. Frideswide's peaceful English September is disrupted by the arrival of a familiar but less-than-welcome guest. Lady Ermentrude, great aunt to the saintly novice Thomasine, always enjoys tormenting the timid girl by threatening to find her a husband before Thomasine can take her final vows. This time she's just two weeks away from that great moment. So when Ermentraude dies of poisoning in St. Fridewide's guest hall, after a hard and hasty ride on some mysterious family business, Thomasine - unlikely murderess though she might make - is nevertheless everyone's prime suspect.<br /><br />Everyone's, that is, except Sister Frevisse. Although she has to admit that Thomasine does look guilty, the convent's hosteler looks elsewhere instead of accepting the too-easy answer (in contrast to the \\"crowner\\" who investigates on the King's behalf, and the rest of Lady Ermentrude's family).<br /><br />I seldom read mysteries. I picked this one up because of its setting in time and place, hoping for a few hours of amusement; and author Frazer delivered that in spades. Sister Frevisse, a mixture of involuntarily learned worldliness and devotion to the godly, contemplative life that's her choice, is a thoroughly original character. So, in their different ways, are the tale's other major players. What pleased me most, though, was the simple joy of reading a novel that depicts medieval nuns as people. That by itself would have been more than worth the read.<br /><br />It was easy to forget among the quiet patterns of St. Frideswide's that its nuns were the daughters, granddaughters, sisters of men who held their inheritance by right of arms and battle skills. As nuns and women their daily life held little need for their inheritance of courage, but their blood remembered.<br /><br />Yes! Exactly!	2005-09-06

Journalist and friend to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Edward Klein uses his \\"insider\\" knowledge of Kennedy family events and dynamics as well as top-notch research to document the way tragedy has dogged the clan for the past century and half. He structures his book as a series of extended essays, choosing an individual family member as each essay's focus. What he does not do is document any supernatural \\"curse\\" such as the book's title might suggest. Instead, he demonstrates - as he apparently set out to do - that any curse affecting these people's lives is of their own and their parents' making.<br /><br />I personally found the secondhand psychoanalyzing of people who didn't voluntarily participate in this project rather - what word do I want? It made me uncomfortable, at the very least. It also made me question the validity of conclusions based on that sort of analysis, because I have to wonder about the ethics of mental health professionals willing to diagnose public figures from afar. However, those passages worked much better than the ones in which the author himself - who if he has mental health or social work credentials doesn't mention them - supplied the anaylsis. Had he let the facts speak for themselves, though, I suppose he wouldn't have produced a book-length work for publication.<br /><br />Not bad. But not great, either.	2005-09-03

Sixteen-year-old Rudi Matt works as a hotel dishwasher in the 19th Century Swiss village of Kurtal. Every day of his life he's stared up at the Citadel, the one remaining unclimbed peak in the Alps. Fifteen years ago three men tried that climb. One, the hotel cook who is Rudi's boss, came back crippled. Two were carried down dead: Guide Josef Matt, Rudi's father, and his \\"herr\\" or client, a great English mountaineer.<br /><br />Rudi understands why his mother forbids him to follow his father's profession, even though her brother - Rudi's Uncle Franz - is one of Kurtal's most successful guides. Rudi will learn the hotel business, first in Kurtal and later in Zurich. His mother has already given one man to the Citadel and its fabled demons. She won't risk giving another. But Rudi can't help himself. He has to climb. When he meets another famous English mountaineer, Captain John Winter - and proves his strength and skill by saving Winter's life - it's only a matter of time. The Citadel waits to be climbed, and Josef Matt's son knows he's the man who must climb it.<br /><br />This is another re-read for me, a book I loved in girlhood and find myself loving even more many years later. BANNER IN THE SKY started me reading mountaineering books despite my personal hatred for both heights and cold weather, and I've savored many such tales - some true life, some fictional - since then. This remains my personal favorite in the latter category. It's smoothly yet colorfully written, and anyone whose youthful dreams a careful parent couldn't share is sure to experience Rudi's coming of age right along with him.	2005-08-28

Marie, Michigan, which is still frontier country when the Civil War begins. She thinks the war should be far enough away to give her family and their community little trouble, but she soon finds out that's not the case. The family of her best friend and neighbor, Sarah Tuttle, loses husband and father Caleb because he thinks it right to volunteer. Phebe promises to help Sarah, whose mother has nine children at home, any way she can; and Phebe's parents encourage her to do this, even though her only sibling - baby brother Benjamin - grows sicker every day. That's one reason why Phebe's mother has no time to answer letters from Uncle James, who lives a lot closer to the fighting in Pennsylania. So Phebe offers to take over the job of corresponding with Uncle James, and soon finds herself enjoying their exchanges. She confides in him about things she doesn't dare mention to those around her in Sault Ste. Marie, and he supplies news about the war.<br /><br />As local men die and word of their loss reaches home, the first news from Caleb Tuttle arrives in a different and totally unexpected form: a Negro family just off the underground railroad. The little frontier settlement has to deal with five living, breathing examples of why their absent men are fighting, and Phebe has to grow up even faster than she's already begun to when tragedy strikes at home and a letter arrives from the front.<br /><br />This fact-based YA novel looks at a much-described period in U.S. history from a little-used viewpoint, that of a young girl on the home front. It mixes and contrasts matter-of-fact daily life (which of course had to go on) with war's horrific events, and makes the reader feel the ebb and flow of Phebe's spirits right along with her. I highly recommend it for readers of all ages. It's realistic without being pessimistic, and its hopeful message is absolutely relevant for today.	2005-08-26

On the Goose Bar Ranch in Wyoming, between the World Wars, former Army captain Rob McLaughlin and his Eastern blue-blood wife, Nell, are raising two sons and an ever-growing herd of thoroughbred horses. Rob, a stern but loving father, doesn't know what to do with younger son Ken. The boy daydreams constantly, and for that reason just failed to be promoted at his boarding school. Why should Rob give small Ken a colt of his own, as he already has older son Howard, when Ken can't do anything that demonstrates he's responsible enough to be trusted? Yet a colt is what Ken wants more than anything else in the world. Until he finds out what happens to male horses when they're two years old - after which he decides he'd rather have a filly.<br /><br />Not just any filly, though. Flicka, born to the half-wild mare called Rocket. Flicka is faster already than her sire, the ranch's stud horse Banner, and Ken believes he'll be able to train Rocket's \\"bad blood\\" out of the yearling. Rob thinks his son is (to use his word for it) dumb, for a lot of reasons that now include choosing this filly that Rob is sure will turn out to be just as \\"loco\\" as her dam. Untrainable, and downright dangerous to those who try to handle her.<br /><br />This novel is a perfect example of the type of children's classic that, when read by adults, proves to have depths and layers its target audience never perceives. I know I read it as a young girl, and enjoyed it as both a good \\"horse story\\" and coming of age tale. But in reading it again now, I was amazed by the detailed and multi-faceted characters of Rob and Nell. Their love story is one of the most interesting I've read, because the author not only captures the tensions between these two very different people - she also captures the way that raising their children, who are (for better or worse!) a blending of those differences, affects their relationship. No wonder this book is still in print more than 60 years after it was first published. Simply wonderful!mply wonderful! <br />	2005-08-26

I've read most of Crichton's fiction, and I've been particularly interested in the way his characterizations of men and women have changed over time. Now I understand the background for those changes in his work, after reading this chronicle of decades of this author's personal development.<br /><br />\\"New Age\\" experiences do nothing for me, but I nevertheless found it interesting to read about Crichton's perception of such experiences - and, especially, about his need to have them. The medical school chapters and the straight travel chapters engaged me best, though, because I could relate to them in a way I couldn't hope to relate to his accounts of channeling, exorcism, and so on.<br /><br />Worth reading for Crichton fans, although I'm not sure how much interest this book might hold for someone unfamiliar with his fiction.	2005-08-13

At 18, Paul Burrell left his home in northern England to become a footman at Buckingham Palace. He rose within a year's time to the coveted post of footman to Queen Elizabeth II, a job that he loved and did well. When Prince Charles and Princess Diana offered him employment as the butler for their country home a decade later, Paul accepted only because by then he had a family. His wife wanted the move, so their two small sons could grow up in what she thought would be more suitable surroundings. For some months afterward Paul wondered what he'd gotten himself into. The last thing he expected was that after the Prince and Princess of Wales parted ways, he would wind up as the one person Diana couldn't do without. His title in her separate household was also \\"butler,\\" but that didn't begin to describe the role he came to occupy in the life of his Boss.<br /><br />I picked this book up prepared to be skeptical of its author. By the time I'd finished reading it, though, I found myself convinced that he had told his readers the truth as he knew it. The royals he describes don't come across as idealized - not even Diana, to whom he remained devoted long afer her death. They're real people with their full share of faults. I read their stories, and Mr. Burrell's as it intertwined with theirs, with as much absorption as if I were reading a well-written novel. Fascinating!	2005-08-06

In the not-so-far-off future, machines have taken over much of the work that Humans once did. The government of what was the United States of America, dominated by a movement called Avantism, polices its citizens ruthlessly and punishes deviance from this philosophy's ideals. That's undoubtedly why Fireball, a vast private company that owns the entire space travel industry, has its headquarters in Ecuador. Anson Guthrie, Fireball's founder, died in the flesh decades ago. But his \\"downloaded\\" personality, and all his knowledge and life experience, lives on as a sentient computer program. As the story opens, Fireball pilot Kyra Davis finds herself on the run with her \\"jefe\\" - Download Guthrie - to protect from capture by the American government that wants to use him to gain control of Fireball.<br /><br />The first half (and more) of this book recounts Guthrie's flight from the Avantist authorities, and Kyra's adventures among the genetically engineered and no longer quite Human \\"Lunarians\\" who have built an independent and unique new culture on Terra's natural satellite. The remainder of the novel takes us along with Guthrie, Pilot Davis, and others whom we've come to know as a band of hardy souls sets out to transform an alien planet into their new home. This gives the book an odd structure, with so many of its pages covering a relatively short period of time and the rest leaping through events decades apart. You might say that \\"change of pace\\" takes on a whole new meaning.<br /><br />Anderson's characters engaged me despite lapses into stereotype, and I found his descriptions of the Lunarians' culture and of Demeter's transformation vivid and enthralling. Anson Guthrie's politics are those of the old-line, 1950s science fiction hero: the standard \\"government's job is to leave people alone\\" sermon comes out of his mouth repeatedly, reminding me very much of Heinlein's juvenile SF books. Whatever one's politics (Guthrie's are certainly Libertarian!), the questions the characters have to answer are valid ones for Humans today. What will technology make of us? (Not necessarily, \\"What will we make of technology?\\") And what is it that makes us Human, anyway?

The wizarding world's turmoil is spilling over into the Muggle universe as this sixth book in the Harry Potter series opens. Sixteen-year-old Harry and his friends return to Hogwarts nevertheless, with their OWL exams behind them and their sixth year of schooling ahead. They're old enough for romance, and Harry is old enough in Dumbledore's eyes to learn some truths that the headmaster has kept from him until now. That's fortunate, because Harry soon realizes that Dumbledore - the last parent-surrogate in the orphan wizard's young life - isn't a well man. Is it old age, which comes even to wizards some day? Or is Dumbledore's clandestine role in the war against He Who Must Not Be Named exacting a terrible toll?<br /><br />Dark fantasy relieved by frequent jolts of Rowling humor. A bit of an overdose of adolescents making fools of themselves where the opposite gender's concerned (although I was pleased by Harry's choice of partner). A traumatic death, a dramatic betrayal, and lots of opportunities to spend time with characters we've come to love. While this book is more a setup for the final volume than a complete story by itself, I found it thoroughly enjoyable. My one complaint is that the closing pages - oddly enough - dragged. Instead of an attempt at denouement, I'd have preferred a simple: TO BE CONTINUED.<br /><br />Four and a half stars rounded up to five. Dare I admit that I've read it twice already?	2005-07-22

Kathryn Janeway has done it again. She's ordered Voyager off course to investigate an intriguing scientific anomaly, and landed herself and her crew in the middle of an alien species' survival crisis. This time the aliens are called Monorhans, and they're facing extinction because their star system exists in a region of space where the normal laws of physics don't apply. Just the sort of scientific and compassionate puzzle that Janeway - former science officer, explorer, and de facto Federation ambassador to the Delta Quadrant - can't possibly resist.<br /><br />Jeffrey Lang is a new author for me, although he's written novels based on other Trek series. He has the Voyager characters absolutely nailed. As I read, I often burst out laughing because he'd gotten them so right. The plot is well presented, and the Monorhans - like all good Trek species - are alien enough to be interesting, but have enough in common with Humans so we can understand and empathize with them as individuals.<br /><br />A terrific read! I hope the next installment of this series, which has a different author, will keep up to the high standard Mr. Lang sets in this opener.	2005-07-02

She's in her seventies now, enjoying good health despite a few of the usual age-related physical problems, and she's tremendously thankful that she can still keep a routine of daily practice. When she meets an old friend whom she hasn't seen since she was seventeen years old, she has no idea that their renewed connection will draw her into a mystery that is somehow tied to the cathedral where Felix Bodeway was once Bishop of New York. She's simply amazed that the boy she knew could have turned into a clergyman.<br /><br />This thoroughly adult (in the best sense of that word) novel is peopled with characters familiar to L'Engle's readers from her young adult books. I found it fascinating to look at them through a different pair of eyes - those of sophisticated expatriate, septugenarian Katherine. As always, even L'Engle's \\"minor\\" characters reach the page fully fleshed. The novel plays itself out in layers, as each event in Katherine's present day life (her \\"new\\" life of retirement) reminds her of her past. She moves back and forth through time, across the Atlantic and back, and takes the reader along without causing confusion. Writing with this technique takes skill, but it's absolutely necessary when following the thoughts of an elderly protagonist whose work now is to make sense out of the past. To think through everything that she had no time to analyze while she was living it, and to come to terms with everything she's lived long enough to regret.<br /><br />L'Engle's best, in my opinion; and I've been reading L'Engle since I discovered A WRINKLE IN TIME over 40 years ago. Wise and unsentimental, yet brimming with hope and with common human love. Highly recommended, indeed!	2005-06-20

After the sudden death of his beautiful and accomplished wife, Rebecca, de Winter flees to Monaco. He astonishes both himself and the book's nameless narrator by marrying that narrator just weeks after meeting her. The new Mrs. de Winter is barely out of school, and so poor that she's in Monaco as paid companion to an obnoxious widow. Does Maxim really love her? Or is he simply unable to bear returning alone to his beloved Manderley, with Rebecca no longer there?<br /><br />The young second wife is out of her depth socially and economically, feeling far more kinship with her husband's staff of servants than with his friends. Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper who came to Manderley when Rebecca was Maxim's bride, realizes that immediately and takes full advantage. Mrs. Danvers adored Rebecca, and hates the woman who now occupies her place at Manderley. Which Rebecca seems never to have left, after all....<br /><br />I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It's beautifully written, with rich detail and a slow, subtle building of menace that's ultimately far more creepy than modern \\"in-your-face\\" scare-fests ever manage. I especially like the flaws in Du Maurier's heroes, and the sympathetic qualities of her villians. Not only does that make the characters, all of them, more realistic; it also matches the novel's start-to-finish ambiguity. In a lesser writer's hands that ambiguity might come off as unsatisfying, but Du Maurier manages to strike exactly the right note. Especially - where it matters most - on the final page.	2005-06-07

I've somehow managed to read Book One of the series last, but the story on which McCaffrey based it was so memorable that I almost thought I'd read it already. Until I noticed its copyright date, and realized that couldn't be true!<br /><br />Orphaned at age three, little Angharad Gwyn has her memories of those first years of her life blocked by rescuers who desperately need to silence the child's telephathic cries for her dead parents. Since she therefore can't even remember her name, she comes to be called \\"the Rowan child\\" - for the mining company whose remote work site has fallen victim to a landslide, of which this little girl is the sole survivor. Hers is the strongest Talent that the Human colony-world Altair has yet bred, and she's immediately marked for training as a tower-dwelling Prime. She'll spend her adult life shifting cargo containers and passenger vessels, and military units as well, from one star system to another. Instantly, across light years of space. The Rowan's future looks bright, but lonely; because when Primes travel between worlds, they suffer horribly. Everyone knows that's true. Everyone, that is, except Jeff Raven - a \\"wild\\" Talent on far-off Deneb, who calls out to the Rowan for help when an alien invasion force bears down on his colony.<br /><br />This is classic McCaffrey. Science fiction romance, published before anyone identified the sub-genre as such, with an intriguing \\"villian\\" in the alien invaders whose nature the rest of the series continues to explore.

Dating from 1933 in its first edition, this book is part biography and part psychological analysis of the great Austrian Empress Maria Theresa's daughter who died a hated Queen of France. While both its writing style and its ideas - particularly its author's assumptions about the fundamental nature of womanhood - may seem quaint to the 21st Century reader, it's still very well worth reading. Zweig refuses to rely upon a number of commonly used sources that he has reason to consider suspect, and he approaches his subject with genuine interest that's refreshingly uncontaminated by awe. The Archduchess Antoinette, the Dauphiness of France, the giddy young Queen to Louis XVI, the maturing mother of the Dauphin who would have become Louis XVII - Zweig captures them all, and then takes us with him through this woman's terrible final transformation into the prematurely white-haired \\"Widow Capet\\" who mounts the scaffold. He writes her life with frankness that's remarkable, truly, considering the era in which his work was originally published.	2005-05-22

According to the author's \\"factual note\\" at the end, the first three chapters of this book are indeed the manuscript of Ibn Fadlan, relating his experiences with the Northmen in A.D. 922. The tale that's spun from this beginning is fiction, but Crichton manages to mimic Fadlan's style so well that I found the transition seamless.<br /><br />Who might the \\"wendol\\" of Northern legend have been, in truth? Crichton bases his story on one theoretical answer to that question. This richly detailed little book (compared to the lengths of his later works) took me along on Ibn Fadlan's adventure, and made me believe it real for as long as I stayed immersed. That's the best compliment I can give to any author.	2005-05-13

Before that, though, he watches as Jews gradually return to their ancient homeland. As men like Gideon Asch (who feels more like this novel's hero than does Ishmael, its apparent protagonist) drain the malarial swamps, reclaim the rich farmland, and found communities that men like Ishmael's father cannot drive out. Political maneuvering on an international scale combines with local events to push families like Ishmael's out of their ancient villages, rendering them stateless as one of the least expected results of Israel's return to nationhood. The tragic results sound like a half-century's worth of mideast headlines. And yet....<br /><br />Excepting only Mein Kampf, I have never in my life read a book so filled with hate as this one is. Should I really believe that Arab culture, and the Moslem religion, are that hatred's source? I came away from THE HAJ quite sure that was the author's intention. Yet this attempt by the author of EXODUS at telling \\"the other side of the story\\" left me feeling that he hadn't succeeded, because this cannot be the story that Palestinians would tell about themselves.<br /><br />Bogs down in places, particularly with lengthy lessons in history and politics - this material would have been better worked into the story. Well written overall, like everything else by Leon Uris (whose work I normally love). If nothing else, it's made me mightily curious to go out and learn more from hopefully less biased sources.	2005-05-10

You're Patty now.\\" It starts there, the stripping away of a child's identity so that the managers can rebuild her to their own specifications. The one thing that makes this child worth the effort, though, is there already: phenomenal acting talent. The kind of talent that makes Patty Duke a Broadway star at twelve, and an Oscar-winner at sixteen.<br /><br />Alcoholism and mental illness surround her in childhood, and breaking away from her managers (who become her surrogate parents early on) just before her eighteenth birthday sets her adrift in a world for which she is totally unprepared. Pat, as she calls herself then, marries early and almost doesn't make the tricky transition from child star to adult actress. Disastrous career decisions, broken relationships, financial debacles - they're all here, and Ms. Duke recounts them without flinching. But running throughout her life story are other threads, the ones that keep her going until the manic depression that causes her roller coaster behavior is finally diagnosed and treated. This woman loves her craft, and she adores her children. Thanks to those two loves, she survives and eventually rediscovers herself. Not Patty; not Pat. Anna Marie.<br /><br />So many celebrity biographies end with an overdose of pills or booze, or a car crash, or a razor blade in a bathtub. I found it refreshing to read this outwardly similar tale, which ends instead with a life rebuilt. With - corny as this is going to sound - a new beginning.	2005-05-01

But in 1959 I was all of seven years old, and I'm well aware that times have changed since then - so much so that women now captain ships. To which I can only say, \\"At last!\\"<br /><br />A.A. Hoehling's meticulously researched and documented collection begins in 1948, with a tragic fire aboard a trans-Atlantic packet. It works its way forward chronologically through the Civil War, the Great War (otherwise known as World War I), and World War II, concluding in 1959 with the disappearance off Greenland of the Hans Hedtoft. If you're not interested in stories of this type, you'll find this a dry book and you'll wonder how anyone could care about its details. But if you love this particular nonfiction genre as much as I do, you'll probably join me in considering it a forgotten gem.	2005-04-24

In the far future where humans live their potentially endless lives in cycles, regaining youth repeatedly, she has far more time to do as she pleases than did her ancestors; but she also has a great deal more to lose by risking violent death. Her father, head of the powerful House of Windholm, would like her to start playing it safe (or at least safer). He'd like her to settle down, now that she's already lived a lifetime or two, and start raising a family of her own. But Lissa isn't ready to do that. She's much too busy joining a Gargantuan (think \\"Tyrannosaur\\") scientist on a remote archaelogical dig. And after that moving on to the next adventure, and the next....<br /><br />The search for the fabled Forerunners, whose civilization spread across the galaxy long before humankind's rise, ties the several otherwise disjointed stories in this book together - so loosely that it might be called a collection instead of a novel. While not up to the old master Anderson's former standard (it has an awkward, not-quite-finished quality), it's nevertheless a pleasant read. A lot more fun than some lesser writers' best, in fact!	2005-04-22

Everest Disaster	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Couldn't put it down until I'd turned the last page	On May 10, 1996, journalist Jon Krakauer achieved one of his dreams. He stood on the summit of Mount Everest, and looked down on the rest of the world. But getting to Everest's summit turned out to be the easy part - for him, and for the other climbers in several teams who were on the mountain's upper reaches that day. By the time it was all over, eight of those climbers were dead and a ninth had lost his right hand to gangrene. Among the dead was famed New Zealand guide Rob Hall, leader of the expedition that included Krakauer.<br /><br />How does a writer recover from being part of something that traumatic? He writes about it, of course. Telling the kind of \\"humans against nature\\" tale that's high adventure at its best, but at the same time exploring his own motivations and those of others who share the summiting obsession.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed Krakauer's explanations of how Everest expeditions fit into the economies of Tibet and Nepal, and of how the demand to staff those expeditions with Sherpas affects the local culture. That's the main difference I noticed between this book and other accounts of high peak climbing that I've read. A journalist wrote this one. The research that went into it shows throughout; yet the author manages to avoid a dry textbook quality, even in the early chapters, because his style is highly readable and his personal involvement creates a constantly building sense of urgency. For me this was one of those \\"can't put it down until the last page is turned\\" books. I think it's destined to become a classic.	2005-04-15

The Clone Wars still rage, with Jedi knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi dashing from crisis to crisis. Although Anakin is no longer Obi-Wan's padawan apprentice, he's not yet a Jedi master in his own right; and that rankles, because in spite of his youth Skywalker knows himself to be the galaxy's most powerful Jedi. Nevertheless they are still a team, and a famous one at that. Kenobi carefully looks the other way where the beautiful senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala, is concerned. Officially he doesn't know that Anakin and Padme are husband and wife - and neither (officially, at least) does anyone else. Yet that's the case, and now it won't remain secret for long. Padme is pregnant, and Anakin - haunted always by fears that his Jedi training hasn't brought under control - dreams of her death in childbirth. Preventing that dream from coming true, as his nightmares so often have in the past, becomes his obsession. He will do anything to keep her safe. Anything at all.<br /><br />How could the poignant and gifted little slave boy Anakin was at nine years old grow up to become Darth Vader? How could nineteen-year-old Anakin, Obi-Wan Kenobi's exasperating yet beloved and brilliant apprentice, pass through that horrible transformation just a few short years later? REVENGE OF THE SITH delivers a credible answer, presenting the first Jedi knight named Skywalker as the flawed hero of a classic tragedy. It's also an exciting adventure story, of course, and an interesting character study to boot. I do have a few criticisms that keep me from giving this one five stars, though. The \\"this is how it feels to be (insert name of character)\\" scenes sandwiched into various chapters have an awkward, flow-interrupting quality, making me wish the author had chosen a different technique to accomplish his goal of making the reader experience being inside the character's mind and skin. Italics are over-used, reminding me of how some Victorian letter writers underscored every other word for emphasis. There's also (which is not author Stover's fault, of course, but it affects his book nevertheless) a glaring continuity problem that I won't mention because it would be a major spoiler.<br /><br />Overall, a satisfying read; and a very good job of tying up the loose ends of the first trilogy while setting the stage for the second one's opening.r word for emphasis.

During the next five years he becomes like a son to the owner of the vast estancia (ranch), an aging bachelor. Raul wants nothing more from his employer than friendship, so he's astonished when - in the wake of Senor Mendoza's sudden death - he finds himself owning most of the estancia. Mendoza's long-time housekeeper, Dona Helena, is equally amazed to find herself owning the hacienda she's spent her whole adult life tending.<br /><br />What in Raul's past terrifies him when, since the passing of a great landholder's property into unexpected hands is news indeed, the press shows up to cover the story? And who, really, is the beautiful and wealthy young woman who arrives at the estancia on the arm of the U.S. ambassador and wants to start an archaeological dig?<br /><br />Contemporary romance in an intriguing setting.

America before the health care (and health insurance) industry. America as it was between 1868 and 1932. Sounds nostalgic and wonderful, doesn't it? But this is also a pre-pension plan America in which a single female schoolteacher faces penniless old age. This extraordinary novel paints an uncompromising picture of a midwestern town from just after the Civil War until the opening years of the Great Depression, by following the lives of the charter members of the Waynesboro Woman's Club.<br /><br />I do think this story - or these stories, more accurately - could better have been told in a series of novels, because this single very long book necessarily passes over much that its readers might want to explore more fully. Sometimes key events are \\"told\\" in a few paragraphs, when it would have been better to \\"show\\" these events in additional chapters. However, I found it amazing that the author managed to tell all the tales included as fully as she did. What impressed me most was the matter-of-fact way she managed to include material that's seldom found in novels about well-mannered and educated middle-class ladies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Anne Alexander Gordon, Sarah Cochran Rousch, and their friends and descendants live fully realized lives, confirming what we ought to know already but sometimes find it hard to believe: that while times, politics, wars and economies may change, people don't. All that changes is how they fit themselves into the realities of their times.	2005-04-10

McMullen's \\"Manipulated Evil\\" series opens. They find themselves in a mysterious third world, where a woman named Rania asks for their help. At first that seems laughable, with both Earth and Tiernaine ravaged by a bioengineered plague and Ravyn's Guardians locked in battle with the forces of her evil half-brother, Rhynon. But when Rania tells them truths neither knew before, Ravyn's priorities must change. The danger is greater than they imagined, as the evil their elders set in motion a generation ago rushes toward its apocalyptic conclusion. Is there any chance at all they can halt that rush? Or is it too late, already, for all the worlds this evil touches?<br /><br />Scattered Souls is a roller coaster ride of a story. As the plot threads weave in and out among a growing cast - none of them superfluous - the author keeps readers grounded from scene to scene by staying firmly within each \\"on stage\\" character's point of view. These are characters who grow as the tale progresses, in ways that flow naturally from who they were before the events that change them. That's true for the tale's villians fully as much as for its heroes.<br /><br />The cliffhanger ending left me breathless, after reading the book straight through. Well done!

McMullen's work blurs the genre boundaries, and once again she's kept me reading until I finished the book. From the wonderfully creepy prologue to the cliffhanger ending (this is Book One in a trilogy), this story held me captive.<br /><br />College student Kyle D'Arcy knows nothing of his true heritage. He believes he's the son of the couple who reared him. Bored, goal-less, and more spoiled by his easy life than he realizes, Kyle finds himself as baffled as both his mother and the police are when his father's murder calls him home. Who would want to kill Carter D'Arcy? What's in the envelope the geneticist left hidden in his home office, with Kyle's name shakily printed on it? And who is the striking young woman in a photograph that shares space with Kyle's likeness, when investigators go through the older D'Arcy's wallet?<br /><br />Her name is Ravyn. Unlike Kyle, she knows all about her heritage - and his, too. She's as hard as he is soft, a trained and seasoned soldier (and leader) in a war for which Carter D'Arcy failed to prepare Kyle. A war that pulls the young man in nevertheless, forcing him to either rise to its demands or die. A war on which the fates of at least two worlds hang, although the people of Earth know nothing about it. Yet.<br /><br />What is the true nature of evil? How can it come not from ill intent, but from good people who do wrong believing that \\"this one time, the end justifies the means\\"? As I read THE UNSEEN, I asked myself those timeless questions. Sometimes I shivered in sympathy with the characters, and sometimes I wanted to reach through the pages and shake them. I couldn't wait to read Book Two!	2005-04-06

After all, she was a grown woman - a college graduate, married to a man she loved, and the mother of a small daughter - when that happened. Sometimes the memories seem faded, though; and sometimes she can't afford to let herself dwell on them. This reality is so very different, and so very dangerous for those who don't submit to its demands.<br /><br />Her husband was divorced, so in the eyes of Gilead's God (who doesn't recognize second marriages) she's a loose woman in need of rescue. Since she still has viable ovaries, that rescue takes the form of retraining for life as a handmaid. A baby machine, assigned to one of Gilead's powerful \\"Commanders\\" whose Wife cannot bear children. Even Wives are no longer allowed to hold jobs, control money, or read and write. Women in this society exist only to service men, in one manner or another. Handmaids are nothing more than walking wombs. With even her name taken away (\\"Offred\\" being literally \\"Of Fred\\" - an appellation she'll leave behind when her posting to this particular Commander's household ends), the narrator of this bleak and frightening novel struggles to keep herself alive on all the levels that matter.<br /><br />Although I'm told the author denies she intended to write a work of speculative fiction, I can see why THE HANDMAID'S TALE is sometimes called a companion piece to Robert A. Heinlein's REVOLT IN 2100. However, Atwood's dystopia combines elements of several different Fundamentalist movements (including clear Muslim echoes); while Heinlein's future U.S. traces direct roots to Christian Fundamentalism. There are many more differences than the obvious one of viewpoint, between Atwood's 30-something female protagonist and Heinlein's innocent young hero.<br /><br />I often wanted to put this book down, but couldn't. Disturbing yet brilliant, it calmly charts the many ways in which women can be set against each other once their personhood had been taken away.

The United Federation of Planets, of which both worlds are founding members, has a 75-year history behind it. Apparently the relationships forged between Vulcans and Humans are prospering, with one man - Spock, the first Vulcan/Human hybrid - standing between them as a living symbol. Yet now there's a movement among Vulcans to pull out of the Federation, and it has enough support to force first a planet-wide debate and then a vote. Sarek, Spock's father and Vulcan's long-time ambassador to Earth, goes home to testify...for secession?<br /><br />This makes no apparent sense, because secession will require Sarek to choose between his Human wife, Amanda, and every other tie he has except the shared one with their son. No non-Vulcan will be allowed on the planet afterward, not even as a visitor; and any Vulcan who insists on continuing to associate with members of other species must do so by going into irrevocable exile. Yet Sarek finds it his duty to testify in favor of secession. Just as James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy, and Spock will testify against it. What's going on here?<br /><br />While a great many of this book's details have been contradicted by canon (filmed Star Trek) since its publication, that needn't stand in the way of a reader's enjoyment. Author Duane has an excellent grasp of the \\"big three\\" TOS characters, and her version of Vulcan's history stands well on its own. My only criticism is that I can't imagine how she justifies portraying Sarek, and other Vulcans of his era, in the - well - flagrantly emotional way she writes them. Sarek laughing for an hour over one of Amanda's jokes? That did NOT work for me. At all. I had the feeling that I was reading something by a fan fiction author who didn't like canon and was working hard to fix what she didn't like about it to her own satisfaction.<br /><br />But that by no means spoils the book.

With the exception of the main character in AIRFRAME, has he ever written a competent and caring young mother? Peter Smith, the protag of RISING SUN, is a divorced father whose ex-wife literally can't be trusted to change their two-year-old's diaper and do it right. He's also a police lieutenant who has switched from being a detective to the press division - and from there, to being the department's VIP liaison specializing in Japanese VIPs. It's his job to respond whenever a Japanese diplomat or executive gets in trouble with the local law, so that the incident will do as little public relations damage as possible. So one evening as he's studying Japanese (a requirement of his relatively new position), he's called in to smooth matters between an obnoxious detective and the owners of a new office building. Right at the start of their star-studded opening party, those owners have to deal with a murder in their boardroom.<br /><br />Competent writing (I'd expect nothing less from Crichton), a decent although not wonderfully inventive plot, and fairly interesting characters don't save this novel from bogging down whenever the author decides to give his readers a lesson in history, politics, and economics as those disciplines relate to U.S./Japanese relations - especially to the well-known \\"buying up\\" of U.S. real estate and businesses by Japanese investors. I got the feeling that this book was written to sound a warning, not to tell an entertaining story. Yet it does have its moments of crackling suspense, and the relationship between old Japan expert Captain Connor and the much younger Lieutenant Smith comes across both believably and amusingly. Not a total miss, but not Crichton at his best, either.	2005-03-03

An alien invasion force bears down upon a fringe world called Bakura, and the Empire - reeling from the loss of its emperor - can't send help in time. The Alliance responds instead, with a task force commanded by Luke Skywalker and a diplomatic mission in the person of Leia Organa. Both Skywalker twins are reeling right along with the Empire, though. Luke suffers from the physical aftereffects of the Emperor's energy bolts, and Leia grapples with her horror at learning that Darth Vader - the man who tortured her, and who destroyed her adopted home-world of Alderaan - was also Anakin Skywalker. Her father.<br /><br />Although it doesn't seem to be part of \\"canon\\" for the Star Wars universe, this book nevertheless offers readers an enjoyable adventure. Force-talented Dev Sibwarra's enslavement by the Ssi-ruuk, and the horror of how these cold-blooded aliens use their human captives, had me turning pages to find out what would happen next. Luke and Leia, Han and Chewie stayed in character throughout the story.<br /><br />Good reading if you're looking for an SF adventure featuring the Star Wars characters.

By the time Jutka and her remaining loved ones are deported, they've already survived being barred from working for a living - being deprived of their property - and being crowded into a ghetto, that used to be one of many neighborhoods where Kaposvar Jewish families lived.<br /><br />Wrenching though the rest of the book is, to me its most interesting aspect is Jutka's calm narration of how the city that once respected and valued her family gradually embraces Nazi-sponsored anti-Semitism. What happens when government institutionalizes hate, and makes it respectable, is all the more frightening because the culture thus poisoned is both ancient and thoroughly civilized.<br /><br />Brrr. Could there be a lesson in this for today's world?	2005-02-10

When her husband Humberto died, Ofelia became her son's dependent in the eyes of Sims Bancorp. Forty years after she helped to found Colony 3245.12, all of her children but Barto are dead along with their father; and Ofelia tolerates her domineering daughter-in-law Rosara as best she can. When Sims Bancorp sends a ship to withdraw the colonists, after deciding to abandon its unprofitable colony and cede its license to the world that Ofelia now considers her home, the company demands extra payment for relocating the useless old woman who will probably die in cryosleep, anyway. Luckily for Ofelia, though, she's scheduled for a later shuttle than Barto and Rosara. When she slips away from the village to hide in the nearby, still untouched alien forest, the only two people who would protest her absence are already in the cryotanks. Soon the ship is gone, leaving Ofelia alone. And that's just fine with her.<br /><br />The old woman revels in her solitude, because this is the first time in her long life that she's been free from the demands and restrictions placed on her by others. She tends her garden, competently maintains the village's power plant, and laughs when she throws her last pair of detested shoes into the recycler. Then another company's ship enters orbit, and starts to insert a colony at a location thousands of miles from Ofelia's village. At which time she, and the newly arrived colonists, find out that this world has indigenous intelligent life after all.<br /><br />The friend who recommended this book to me was right. Ofelia, a person who had little worth to start with in her society's eyes - a housewife and mother, educated no more than necessary to perform her expected tasks - has no value at all now, in age and physical infirmity. But what she does have, a naturally intelligent old woman's experience and wisdom and insight, turn out to be exactly what the unexpected and dangerous first contact situation on her adopted world requires. Grumpy and no longer willing to suffer fools gladly - still savoring life, but no longer reluctant to risk leaving it behind if that's the price of being free at last to make her own choices - Ofelia is at once a fully realized individual, and a worthy representative of all the other wise and salty old women whose value too few Human societies appreciate. Or even comprehend.<br /><br />A thought-provoking delight!ffer fools gladly - still savoring life, but no longer reluctant to risk leaving it behind if that's the price of being free at last to make her own choices - Ofelia is at once a fully realized individual, and a worthy representative of all the other wise and salty old women whose value too few Human societies appreciate.

Certainly she has no gift for command. All she wants in the universe is a chance to live and die away from her native Altiplano, as an officer (preferably a very ordinary and obscure officer) in the Regular Space Service. But after taking command of the Despite when everyone above her in the command chain either turns traitor or dies in the resulting mutiny - and after becoming, as a result, the lowest-ranked officer who's ever won a battle - Lieutenant (j.g.) Suiza can't go back to her cherished anonymity. So Admiral Vida Serrano tells her between the battle's end and the start of her court martial, and so Esmay learns for sure when she goes back to Altiplano for the first time since she was 14. The lesson continues in her next assignment, as a full lieutenant aboard the deep space repair ship Koskiusko.<br /><br />On the Koskiusko Esmay makes the first opposite-gender friend she's ever had: Vida Serrano's grandson, Ensign Barin Serrano. Her new superiors, understanding that this young woman's command gifts are just that - real gifts, unlocked for the first time by the events aboard Despite - search in growing frustration for ways to convince Esmay that she must accept who she really is, and develop the talents no one knew she possessed during her first ten years of RSS life. Then a Bloodhorde commando unit finds its way aboard Koskiusko, and once again Esmay Suiza must rise to the challenge. Once a hero, there's no going back.<br /><br />Part character study (well done, indeed) and part blood-and-thunder space adventure, this book bogs down at times during its first half; but after that the action comes fast and furious. Well worth the read.	2005-01-26

Now, in the concluding volume of the trilogy begun by Hunting Party and continued with Sporting Chance, she's offered what may be a chance to go back to the life she loves best. The charming rural planet where Lady Cecelia wants to do some horse-trading lies undefended, and the so-called Benignity of the Compassionate Hand (an outlaw state) has it slated for scorching and annexation. All that stands between the enemy forces and Xavier's frightened population is Heris and her crew. Aboard what? An armed yacht. Aided by a few shuttles, a snail-like ore carrier, and one museum-vintage starship.<br /><br />This wonderful adventure story gets needlessly complicated in places because of all the subplots we're following as the author moves toward tying up the trilogy's many loose ends. You do need to know the characters already in order to grasp what's going on; I wouldn't recommend trying to read this book first, and reading it as a standalone would be frustrating at best. But it does a fine job of pointing up its theme of maturity, as the younger characters achieve this quality that was lacking when we first met them; and as the older characters start to realize how their potentially endless lives (thanks to \\"rejuv\\") will alter their children's and grandchildren's futures. Or perhaps I should say nieces and nephews, not children and grandchildren; because aside from Heris herself, this book's most notable characters are its formidable maiden aunts.<br /><br />All things considered, an excellent read.	2005-01-21

In this trilogy's second volume, Heris is still captain of Lady Cecelia's yacht; but she now has several members of her former crew with her, including the man who couldn't be her lover in the old days.<br /><br />After delivering Prince Gerel home following certain embarrassing events on Seralis, Lady Cecelia orders the Sweet Delight into a redecorating company's drydock. As Heris prepares to oversee the yacht's refitting, she feels great uneasiness about Lady Cecelia's safety. But trouble, when it comes, strikes the unconventional old lady down in one of the places where she should have been safest. The family rebel, who never needed anyone before, lies helpless in a blind, mute, paralyzed body; and the only people who know she's aware inside that body, Heris and two of her employer's young relatives, also know that what felled her wasn't a massive stroke. As her enemies move to lock Lady Cecelia away permanently and take control of her vast holdings, the disgraced ex-RSS officer and two young socialites form a desperate plan.<br /><br />This story works well on all of its several levels. It's a seat-of-the-pants adventure, set in a well-conceived future universe, cast with characters who change in believable ways as a result of their experiences. It also manages to delve into such serious themes as how families behave toward their nonconforming members in time of crisis, how societies treat their disabled citizens, and how fear of aging can stunt - or even warp - not just individuals, but entire cultures. An excellent read!	2005-01-15
US	40891338	RT8ZT6K02M2BU	0671721763	658606890	Hunting Party	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A gem of a book.	Heris Serrano is making the best of a bad situation. Forced to resign her commission in the Regular Space Service, she goes to work as captain of an elderly lady's private yacht. That's a definite \\"come down\\" in the universe, for this woman whose family habitually produces admirals. Heris still has her professionalism, though. She's determined to bring the Sweet Delight and its crew up to standard. When that determination saves the yacht's owner and her guests - not to mention the crew, of course - from dying during their first passage together, she and Lady Cecelia discover that a champion horsewoman and an RSS captain have more in common than either might have thought. That establishes trust between them which they're going to need, once they reach the private estate (an entire planet!) where Lady Cecelia's bound. Where there's something going on that the owner of Siralis knows nothing about, which has everything to do with Heris Serrano and her former Space Service crew.<br /><br />This is a gem of a book. We come to know Heris Serrano, Lady Cecelia, and the many secondary (I can't call them minor) characters by experiencing their lives with them. That's also how we become acquainted with their far-future part of the universe - its politics, technology, economy, and culture. The story gains complexity gradually, and we get backstory exactly when we need it. The characters learn, grow, and change, and - with the possible exception of the tale's villian - they are multi-dimensional people. Including the apparently quintessential \\"eccentric maiden aunt\\" Cecelia. Highly recommended!	2005-01-12

Readers expecting to learn details of Elizabeth Smart's captivity should look elsewhere; there are no such revelations in this book. Her parents leave it to Elizabeth to tell that story herself, someday, if she chooses to do so. This is Ed and Lois Smart telling their own story, and that of their family's other members, during the months between Elizabeth's kidnapping and her return.<br /><br />Faith played a huge role in keeping the Smart family's hope alive during those months, so it's natural for them to speak of it often. For some readers this may give their book a \\"preachy\\" quality, while for others it may strike exactly the right note. True crime this is not - it's more like a series of essays, sharing each parent's feelings while walking us through the events as they remember them.<br /><br />Worth reading, but oddly dry for all the material's tremendous emotional impact. I came away feeling that someone - authors, ghostwriter, editor(s), I couldn't be sure who - worked so hard at avoiding sensationalism that the effort backfired. 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4.	2005-01-08

What youngster could resist such a mystery's allure? Not Craig Walley, a Mount Hermon student from 1957 through 1961. During the years afterward, throughout his career as an attorney, Walley thought about it often. In 2001 he decided to research the case and write this book.<br /><br />MURDER AT MOUNT HERMON tells the story, provides its background, and analyzes the available evidence with an attorney's precision. I think it's safe to say that you'll come away from it certain you know the murderer's name and understand his motives. More case study than murder mystery, the book reaches for broader relevance - and for a connection to our 21st Century present - by speaking of another time when \\"Fundamentalism\\" and \\"Modernism\\" clashed. Did that clash at Northfield and Mount Hermon, sister schools founded by the great 19th Century evangelist D.L. Moody, lay the groundwork for Elliott Speer's murder? To answer this intriguing question for yourself, you'll have to read the book.	2005-01-08

As Esmay makes her way to Castle Rock, in hopes that her friend Brun Meager-Thornbuckle (of the Familias Regnant) may help, she has no idea that Barin has come close to dying in battle. Traveling aboard a trade-ship that doesn't normally carry passengers keeps her insulated from much of what's happening in the rest of Familias space, as the Fleet is torn apart by mutiny and Brun's family finds itself under attack from within.<br /><br />This seventh volume brings the Heris Serrano/Esmay Suiza series to a rousing conclusion, as the characters we've come to love find their places in the universe and their meticulously drawn society meets its greatest crisis. I'm disappointed that the author leaves several plot threads unresolved (or at least not clearly so), but it's an excellent read just the same. Especially the last poignant, downright haunting chapter.	2005-01-08

But that may not be a problem for other readers, particularly those who've read the Heris Serrano/Esmay Suiza books in order, because \\"Change of Command\\" begins a two-book process of bringing this political and family intrigue saga to its conclusion. Do NOT plan to read this one and stop, because you won't find out what happened without reading \\"Against the Odds\\" afterward.<br /><br />What happens in \\"Change of Command\\"? Brun Meager goes home after her long captivity, and finds herself changed. She hasn't had time to get her bearings when her father's assassination throws the Familias Regnant into turmoil. Meanwhile, Barin Serrano's rescue of the Ranger families in \\"Rules of Engagement\\" is rewarded by Fleet's decision to take his pay - all of it - toward their support, since as far as Fleet is concerned they're not political refugees. They're the ensign's dependents. This complicates the already difficult situation Barin and Esmay face as they plan to marry despite opposition from both powerful families.<br /><br />Moon's enormous cast of characters overwhelmed me at times, but I seldom had difficulty distinguishing and remembering each character once introduced. This book has some slow \\"set-up\\" passages that I found a bit of a slog, but when the action came it was well written and engaged me thoroughly. The uncomfortable questions this series asks set it apart from more conventional coming-of-age and military/political SF tales. What should age and youth offer to each other? Is one more valuable than the other; and if so, why? In our own era of genetic research and leapfrogging medical advances, these are issues it's difficult (if not impossible) for readers to dismiss as belonging only to the far, far future.	2005-01-06

What's worse, I've begun reading them out of order since \\"Rules of Engagement\\" is the second of four Esmay Suiza novels which follow (and in a sense continue) the Heris Serrano trilogy. Author Moon has created a believable universe, the kind in which a speculative fiction reader who's particularly fond of strong-but-flawed female protagonists can't help but get immersed.<br /><br />I have two complaints about \\"Rules of Engagement.\\" First, it told me repeatedly how Esmay and Brun compared to each other when I could and did figure that out for myself from their actions and their words. Second, I'm getting tired of the obligatory female war hero who needs remedial instruction in (shades of Nancy Kwan) how to enjoy being a girl. Despite those two peeves, though, I loved this book. It delivered action, a textured background, and a varied cast of characters with each functioning as an individual. I'm looking forward to reading more.	2004-12-29

The title story deserves all the praise it's received. The writing style has an old-fashioned cadence that's just right for the material, and the inspirational elements come naturally. This is a spiritual tale that avoids preaching, and steers clear of denominations while retaining its Christmas (not generic holiday) theme.<br /><br />The companion tales, TIMEPIECE and THE LETTER, are longer and less satisfying. I came away from these wishing I'd stopped with THE CHRISTMAS BOX, and left the mystery behind it alone. Sometimes less is more - but another reader might well be delighted by \\"the rest of the story\\" of MaryAnne and her family.	2004-12-29

A colony ship wound up orbiting it by mistake, giving the stranded passengers no other option except to land and try their best to survive. A few of them did that for long enough to have children. Now, generations later, their adapted descendants include a hunter named Born. He's a curious young man, so much so that his people call him mad. For what good is curiosity, in a place where seeking to see the sky involves going to a place called Upper Hell?<br /><br />When two giants drop out of the sky, only Born cares enough about the mystery to climb down through the trees and rescue them from their crashed flitter. Although they know less than the smallest child about surviving in this perilous place, Born manages to keep them alive long enough to reach the relative safety of his Home Tree. His tribe thinks it's seen him for the last time when he sets out to guide the strangers to the \\"station\\" from which they say they came - no one ever traveled that far before. As Born learns more and more about these fellow humans whose thinking is so very unlike that of his own people, and as he discovers how they mean to use the awesome power they've brought to Midworld, the young hunter's curiosity turns to horror. These invaders have to be stopped from carrying out their plans. But how?<br /><br />The world-building in this book amazes me. Parable and adventure tale, it works well on both levels; and it ends with a chilling twist that turns what had looked predictable squarely onto its head. Followers of Foster's Flinx books - the more recent ones, especially - will find some delicious foreshadowing in that twist.	2004-12-22

Unemployed at 40, with his job search reaching the six-month mark, Jack attributes his wife's increasingly long hours at her own tech-firm position and her changed behavior when she is with her family to - what else? - an affair. Both his attorney and his psychologist sister encourage him to wake up, smell the coffee, and get ready to deal with Julia's exit from his life. But that's not it. That's not it AT ALL.<br /><br />This could actually happen, if people with the right combination of scientific expertise and moral stupidity make crucial discoveries and ignore long-term consequences in favor of solving short-term problems. Crichton sells his readers on believing this, consistently, as PREY's plot builds through the book's first half and then explodes into action. After that it's a wild ride, indeed.<br /><br />This one's ending, like that of JURASSIC PARK, provides an errie mix of resolution and future menace.

I have tremendous admiration and respect for former President Carter. I am truly sorry I can't post a better review of his first novel, but - well, here it is.<br /><br />The book's greatest strength is the tremendous amount of research that went into it. It works wonderfully well as a history of the American Revolution in the South, and that's certainly a neglected viewpoint. It is also, exactly as I would expect, well written from a technical standpoint.<br /><br />Presented as nonfiction, I'd have found it enjoyable reading; but for me it didn't work as a novel. Its characters speak in stilted, pedagogical voices, imparting information to modern readers when they should be interacting with each other in believable fashion. The endless pages of detail would be appropriate in a history book, but in fiction they make excruciatingly slow reading because they fail - most of the time, anyway - to move the plot along.

He's charged with assault and battery, and the only reason he's being allowed to keep his surgical date is that the experimental procedure should - if all goes well - correct the cause of his violent seizures. Or so the surgical team and the hospital's administrator believe. But Benson's psychiatrist, Dr. Janet Ross, isn't so sure.<br /><br />Although this taut thriller seems meant to caution us about the dehumanizing perils of the computer age, which was just dawning when Crichton wrote it, I found it most interesting for its depiction of physicians by one of their own. By making Janet Ross female, the author casts her as the \\"outsider\\" through whose eyes we readers can see the other doctors' specialty-related foibles. Had the book been written later, this wouldn't have worked as well; but in a 1972 world it's an excellent device. By the time you reach the last page, you'll know more than you may want to know about the minds of those who take care of you when you're most vulnerable. A terrific read!	2004-11-25

What is the future of the printed book? To answer that question, veteran New York City schoolteacher Kirschenbaum looks far into the past and all the way around the world.<br /><br />Frustrated by her students' bored reaction to conventionally printed books, with their blocky fonts and black-and-white text, Kirschenbaum put ordinary personal computer technology to work in her classroom. Adding color alone accomplished wonders.<br /><br />When she researched the history of illuminated texts, Kirschenbaum discovered that the way books have looked since the advent of movable type - since Gutenberg - isn't at all how they looked during all the centuries that came before. In the Hebrew and Arab worlds, in China, in South and Central America as well as in Europe, ancient texts glowed with color. Illustration - lavish illustration - was the rule, not the exception; and each manuscript's \\"font\\" reflected its author or copier's unique hand. All this we gave up when the Gutenberg press made mass production of books possible. Until now, we've had no reasonable alternative because books printed in color cost too much. But then came personal computers and their software. Desktop publishing programs, and color printers. We no longer need to settle for the sameness of black text, unillustrated, on a white page; and that's fortunate, because the generation of students in our high schools now does not, Kirschenbaum tells us, relate well to anything that doesn't grab and hold their visual interest.<br /><br />As a former high school teacher myself (although in business, not literature), I found this book fascinating. While I don't agree with everything the author has to say - for example, I do not think that eBooks have \\"flopped\\"; I think they are only starting to demonstrate their potential - she offers her readers a vision of publishing's future that just may come true. I'm particularly intrigued by the quotations she offers from authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, who dreamed of being able to reach his readers directly and of controlling the appearance of his finished books. Self-publishing's stigma, an outcome of Gutenberg's technological revolution, seems likely to vanish as another revolution transforms the way books are created and the paths by which they reach their readers.<br /><br />Once again we can look into the past, and see the future.

Just before the election, this Democratic Governor of Colorado has satisfied a lifetime longing (and simultaneously risked everything) by discovering his true heritage.<br /><br />From that opening on, the story is told in flashback as Irish cop Dan O'Connell returns to Brooklyn after his World War II Marine Corps service. Dan and his bride, Siobhan, set out soon afterward to look for wider horizons where they can raise their family. They find those horizons in Colorado; but the family doesn't come along until Siobhan's brother, a Roman Catholic priest, arranges for them to adopt a three-year-old boy whose background they can never know. We also follow the rise to economic and political power of Thornton Tomtree, an emotionally stunted genius whose \\"Bulldog\\" computer network eventually drives the nation.<br /><br />Novelist Uris offers his readers both an engrossing family saga, and a moral commentary on the United States at the dawn of the 21st Century. Written prior to 9/11, this book has an uncanny \\"deja vu\\" feel in some of the fictional events it depicts. \\"Who am I?\\" - Quinn Patrick O'Connell's great question, that appears to be answered before we're past the first chapter - turns out to be the one his nation must also ask itself.	2004-11-25

Captain Chakotay of Voyager and his sister, shaman-trained Sekaya, begin this duology's second installment where we left them at the first book's end. Imprisoned on the apparently abandoned colony world Loran II's surface, in the hands of the supposedly dead Cardassian scientist Crell Moset. Delivered there by a shapeshifting \\"Founder\\" who has spent years trapped in the form of a respected Starfleet officer, who now assumes Chakotay's identity and orders Voyager's immediate departure for Earth. Which will leave the real captain and his sister to die in Moset's laboratory, whether from the Butcher of Bajor's horrific research or afterward - because Moset can't afford to let witnesses live.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Admiral Kathryn Janeway's mission to persuade several seceding worlds to remain in the United Federation of Planets is not going well. On the Klingon sacred moon Boreth, B'Elanna Torres continues researching her baby daughter's heritage as the fulfillment of ancient prophecy, after her husband Tom Paris joins Janeway's mission; and on Earth, concert musician and Starfleet spy Libby Webber makes a discovery that's connected to both the admiral's diplomatic assignment and the events unfolding aboard Voyager.<br /><br />This is Golden at her Trek-author best. The story's threads come together in ways that surprise the reader without blindsiding, and the characters we Voyager fans already know so well behave exactly as they should. The new characters Golden introduced in her first Voyager re-launch duology manage to play major parts without making me resent the pages they occupy, although I'm still not sure what she has in mind for Akolo Tare. That's one of several plot threads that aren't tied up neatly. This is fine with me, since I know more books are coming. Although Enemy of My Enemy has a satisfying conclusion, it ends with a twist that has me asking with pleasant anticipation, \\"But what's going to happen next?\\"	2004-11-21

She died with an embyronic queen alien growing inside her, knowing it was the only way. So how can Ellen Ripley be alive again now? Decades later, aboard a laboratory ship in Pluto orbit? And what's become of her unwelcome passenger?<br /><br />I can't believe I read this book through to the last page. Its gore and grossness factor goes far beyond my usual tolerance, which is why I found myself unable to watch the movie on which it's based. But I picked the novelization up anyway because of A.C. Crispin's other work, and she hooked me before I finished the first chapter. Her villians are the kind any reader will love to hiss, her Ripley is the most poignant of heroines, and each of her secondary characters is a memorable individual. Even the aliens themselves gain a certain creepy sympathy in the hands of Crispin and co-author Kathleen O'Malley. Add to this a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping story line, and you've got a winner of a book. Media tie-in or not, it makes no difference.	2004-11-20

If they can't figure out what \\"Project Scoop\\" brought back before the infection starts to spread, humankind could be decimated.<br /><br />This is a familiar science fiction concept, the \\"alien germ\\" against which humans have no defenses. What makes this novel's use of it compelling (even when somewhat dated, 35 years after first publication) is the author's sure grasp of the science involved. While the detail presented is overwhelming at times, and the characters wooden, the story still has frightening credibility.	2004-11-16

For centuries, the Jedi Knights have guarded the Republic and guaranteed its freedom. Now that freedom is threatened by the growing power of the amoral Trade Federation, and by an enemy even the Jedi have cause to fear. The Sith Lords aren't gone from the universe, after all.<br /><br />As the Trade Federation invades the planet Naboo, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn arrives with his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to rescue Queen Amidala. When their ship suffers damage during their escape, they're forced to land on a remote planet called Tatooine. There a nine-year-old slave boy, Anakin Skywalker, proves their only hope of repairing the ship and getting Amidala to the galactic capital of Coruscant. Young Skywalker may be their only hope for a great deal more than Naboo's future, though. As Master Qui-Gon realizes, when he perceives the boy's Jedi-like gifts and discovers through surreptitious testing that Anakin's midi-chlorian count exceeds that of any Jedi on record. Can this child be the promised one? Who will, according to ancient prophecy, restore balance to the Force?<br /><br />Well written and enjoyable. Although this story really does work better on the movie screen, the author does a good job of getting inside the characters' heads. Even the often ridiculed Jar Jar Binks - a comic relief figure, only, in the film - gains enough depth to make him interesting.	2004-11-13

The rest of us-moderns included-married men. Just plain men. And probably at a time when the Presidency wasn't even a glimmer. Don't forget that!\\" Author Feather Schwartz Foster puts these words into the mouth of a character as she closes the introduction to this lively work of historical fiction. From Martha Washington's time through that of Mamie Eisenhower, the First Ladies of the United States of America lived in a society that limited their roles and did its best to stifle their voices. This book aims to give the First Ladies of the pre-women's liberation U.S. back those voices at last. Which, since these Ladies are all long dead, requires conjecture!<br /><br />Even though this is indeed a work of fiction, and a very entertaining one (I chuckled often as I read it), it's important to approach it without imposing what a colleague of mine calls \\"presentism\\" on the Ladies whose words fill its chapters. \\"We must be judged according to the standards of our times-not your times!\\" insists Lucy Hayes, who has supposedly teamed with Caroline Harrison to sign the rest of the Ladies onto the project. Fictional or not, in this sentiment she is absolutely right.<br /><br />The author has researched each of her characters thoroughly, and she demonstrates a solid grasp of the historical context of each Lady's life. Using \\"commentary boxes\\" to allow comments from other Ladies, including those whose stories aren't told because they came after Mrs. Eisenhower, she gives each chapter the intimate feel of a conversation among a few...I was going to say, \\"A few close friends.\\" But that's not true, because often the commentary boxes contain pithy remarks that are decidedly not made by one friend about another! Yet the commentaries are always basically sympathetic, because they're offered with total understanding by the \\"on stage\\" Lady's peers.<br /><br />This one hit all the right buttons for me.

Captain Chakotay takes command of Voyager, the starship that was his home through seven years in the Delta Quadrant, following its complete refit. Once again the ship carries a mixed crew, but this time the tension isn't between Starfleet and Maquis. This split is between returning crew members, who shared the long journey with Chakotay, and those who spent the last seven years in an Alpha Quadrant where the horrific Dominion War recently ended.<br /><br />Chakotay knows that he's received his first command only thanks to Admiral Kathryn Janeway's impassioned advocacy. He also knows that although he has many old friends with him, he doesn't have Lieutenant Commander Tom Paris as his first officer because Starfleet absolutely refused to chance two former Maquis on the same ship. Instead he has Andrew Ellis, an officer so by-the-book that the young man's nickname is Priggy. Also sharing this new journey are Chief of Security Harry Kim, Chief Engineer Vorik, Chief Helm Officer Lyssa Campbell, and - from the first two Voyager relaunch books, although not from the series - Trill physician Jarem Kaz. When Chakotay's sister, Sekaya, joins the expedition as spiritual advisor to the displaced colonists Voyager is returning to their home world, he's delighted. But something is wrong; and initially, at least, an obviously troubled Sekaya won't tell him what.<br /><br />In subplot threads the book also follows Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres on the Klingon sacred moon Boreth; Harry Kim's secret agent and concert musician girlfriend, Libby, on Earth; and Admiral Janeway, who gets a break from her desk job at Starfleet Command when she's assigned to prevent several disillusioned planets from leaving the Federation. By this book's end (an excellent cliffhanger) I could see hints of how the author plans to pull all the threads together. I was especially pleased that the plot grew naturally out of events Voyager fans will remember from the series. I wasn't as happy to have Libby and Akolo Tare - the latter a new character introduced by Golden - still around, but I enjoyed the other holdovers from her first Voyager relaunch duology.

Casey Singleton, a recently promoted business unit manager who's the Quality Assurance representative on that team, knows almost immediately that it wasn't turbulence. The press, though, accepts that explanation as offered by the plane's flight crew. After all, what makes for a more dramatic story than a greedy corporation's attempted coverup of its unsafe aircraft?<br /><br />Casey knows that this is a dangerous time for Norton managers to be poking around the production areas. With a major sale of the company's airframes to an overseas market pending, a labor dispute reaching the boiling point, and a mysterious conflict going on at the topmost management level, anything can happen. But the divorced mother who started her own career with Norton on the production line believes she can keep herself safe - and even if she can't, she's still going to find out what really happened on that flight.<br /><br />AIRFRAME has its slow passages, but it also offers crackling and well-sustained suspense. Its characters are well drawn, and its resolution manages to be surprising, logical, and poignant - all at the same time.	2004-10-23

Earth Resources Technology Services wants something that's hidden deep in the jungles of the Congo, at the Lost City of Zinj. Because it's a resource that can make nuclear power obsolete, others want it just as badly. When their Congo field team's satellite check-in gets interrupted by the deaths of all its members, apparently at the hands of a band of gorillas behaving in totally atypical fashion, ERTS dispatches supervisor Karen Ross to lead the next attempt. As the 24-year-old mathematics prodigy and her new team fight their way toward a goal they may never reach, her drive to succeed may be what keeps them alive. Or it may just as easily be what finally kills them, too.<br /><br />Joining the ERTS team are primatologist Peter Elliot and Amy, an adolescent gorilla trained by Elliot to communicate using American Sign Language. Ross hopes Amy may make a difference if they encounter the first team's killers, while Elliot has his own agenda. Meanwhile, the Congo's chronic unrest boils over into tribal warfare - and the local volcano threatens to just plain boil over.<br /><br />I picked this book up expecting a \\"not his best\\" effort by one of my favorite authors, after finding the movie version rather - well - hokey. But what came across that way on the screen works fine in Crichton's prose. A wild roller coaster ride! Great fun, and a nice tribute to H. Rider Haggard, too.	2004-10-13

Not because he could take such a task seriously. The last thing he expected, years later, was to find himself applying his study's conclusions in real life. But here he is, nevertheless. On his way to a habitat beneath the Pacific Ocean, with a team he hand picked - just long enough ago so that its members aren't exactly the same people they were when he selected them. The habitat has been set up for easy access to a sphere that's been lying on the ocean's floor for 300 years.<br /><br />No 53-year-old in average (less than optimum) physical health belongs where the Navy has decided Norman Johnson should go. He realizes that as he and the rest of the first contact team, of which he is a member rather than the leader, explore the ancient spaceship. When a storm forces the Navy to withdraw surface support, stranding the team, Norman finds out exactly how right he was in some of his theorizing. He also finds out how wrong he was.<br /><br />Sphere is Crichton at his best. The ensemble cast of this novel rings true as the plot sweeps them from crisis to crisis, through twist after twist.

Yet even then you may find it interesting, because you'll learn a lot about how Kingsolver writes.

He's settled happily into his company's Seattle office, has married, and is busy raising a young family. At 41, he's also anticipating the reward for his years of service when his division spins off and goes public. That will certainly secure his financial future, and it just might make him rich. But first he and the company must get through a merger. That may not be easy, because the promotion Tom anticipates goes to - complete surprise - his old girlfriend.<br /><br />To this Tom thinks he can adjust. When Meredith Johnson starts their new relationship with broad references to their old one, and then demands sexual favors, Tom finds out that adjusting won't be possible. What he doesn't know is Meredith's real reason for doing this. If he doesn't discover her hidden agenda in time, the life he treasures now and the future he dreams of for his family will both disappear. And that's if he's lucky. What happens if he isn't lucky? He loses it all. His wife and kids, too.<br /><br />Like Crichton's other books, this one is gripping and well written. However, his stated intention - to show the reader certain truths about sexual harassment by writing the tale in \\"role reversal\\" mode - didn't work for me. Despite meticulous research and a good outward understanding of his subject matter, Crichton's inability to write female characters trips him up this time. The only woman he really \\"gets right,\\" attorney Fernandez, he ruins in the postscript by putting views into her mouth that are at odds (wildly) with her characterization throughout the chapters in which she appears. I agree completely with his pounded in point that women and men are all, in the end, simply people.

Like everyone else connected with that debacle - an eccentric millionaire's attempt to establish the world's most spectacular amusement park by recreating long extinct dinosaurs - Malcolm denies knowing anything about such matters. But a man named Lewis Dodgson, who once paid computer programmer Dennis Nedry to steal dinosaur embryos, knows what happened. Dodgson also knows that there's another island off Costa Rica where the \\"factory\\" supplying Jurassic Park once operated. Dodgson remains determined to find that abandoned facility, for his own ruthless reasons. Meanwhile, scientist Richard Levine also wants to find that island - and Ian Malcolm finds himself drawn back into a nightmare he barely survived before.<br /><br />This book is at least as good a read as Jurassic Park, and in one way I found it better. I thoroughly enjoyed Sarah Harding. Author Crichton's women usually lack credibility with me, but in this one - a wildlife biologist who even in the midst of life-threatening chaos takes time to mentor a talented young girl, and who never, ever gives up! - he's created a character who lives and breathes.	2004-10-01

I would far rather have a good movie which bore very little relation to the book than a poor movie which faithfully photographed the book. A movie is a thing in itself; it should be good in itself, not as a mirror for another form.\\"<br /><br />That's just one of the many gems included in this insightful account, from conception through execution, of how Jessamyn West's novel The Friendly Persuasion became a film. The book takes the form of journal entries that follow the author's life, as she lived it during this time. Unlike many other novelists whose works have become movies, West wasn't much interested in overseeing her own book's filming. She especially wasn't interested in writing the script, because she was immersed in a new manuscript; and because she wisely understood that a novelist and a script writer practice different arts. But in order to help the great director William Wyler capture her characters, and tell their story in a way appropriate for the screen, she found herself learning how to write a script anyway - and she also found herself venturing into the life of a world called Hollywood.<br /><br />Writers and non-writers alike will enjoy West's anecdotes featuring Wyler, actor Gary Cooper, and others. But it's her fellow writers who will read this book with smiles and nods, as West captures over and over feelings that everyone who knows the Muse must recognize. This is a remarkable piece of work.

The collection? Letters sent by T.S. Eliot to one Emily Hale. When Matt Lane won't violate his ethics to satisfy her interest, Roberta maneuvers herself into his life - personal and professional - in a way that both amuses and fascinates him. Roberta reminds him poignantly of his wife, Judith, who died long ago. Roberta and Judith have two things in common. First, they are (or were) both poets; and second, they both grew up in families that kept life-shattering secrets from them. Supposedly, of course, for the noblest of reasons.<br /><br />Since I've worked for many years in an archives environment, I had heard a great deal about this book.

So Stella Renier, nineteen-year-old bride from England, learns when she reaches her new husband's home in South Carolina. It's 1910, and the veterans of the War Between the States are growing old. Yet the conflicts that war failed to resolve - along with some new ones created by its aftermath - simmer just below the surface of the coastal community surrounding the house called Illyria. That house will become the one place Stella regards as home throughout her married life, which is destined to be long. We know this because elderly and recently widowed Stella narrates the story for her adult grandson, during another era of turmoil in the American South. But in 1910, as she comes to Illyria without the husband she's barely had time to wed - sent to his family while Terry Renier sets off on a secret assignment for his employer, the U.S. State Department - it's a fantastic house in an alien country. And her husband's family are, of course, strangers.<br />How can Stella, who grew up at Oxford, understand the basics of keeping herself safe in a place where she's expected to treat the first Negroes she has ever met as if they were members of a different species? How can the girl reared by an agnostic father grasp the conflict between the powerful Christian faith of Honoria, a one-time African princess who takes care of everyone at Illyria, and the dark spirits invoked by the &quot;Granddam&quot; in the desperately impoverished black hamlets just inland from the beachfront homes of the Reniers? Stella doesn't even know the significance of robed horsemen who ride by night. But her husband's people all know it. And so does the English-educated black physician whose danger she increases with every innocent gesture of friendship.<br />&quot;The Other Side of the Sun&quot; is a book to read through to the end, and then read again. It has much to say about the nature of faith, of fate, of aging, and of human love.

Dementors, accosting wizard-in-training Harry Potter while he's living out another summer in the grudging company of his Muggle aunt, uncle, and cousin? That's not supposed to happen. Nor are many other things that take place in this fifth installment of Harry Potter's story, as the wizarding world edges ever closer to renewed war. That would be bad enough all by itself. But what makes matters infinitely worse is the Ministry of Magic's refusal to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned to corporeal life.<br />Professor Dumbledore, Headmaster of the Hogwarts School and the only person whose power Voldemort fears, believes that Harry fought the dark wizard and witnessed his return. So do a few other adults, and Harry's friends. Will those who believe what's too awful to contemplate be able to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters and win? Or will they use all their resources battling against their own - the wizarding world's authorities - while the Muggle world remains, for a time, happily clueless?<br />Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts proves to be his most difficult so far, as he learns what every child must learn sooner or later. That those he looks up to aren't perfect, after all; and that the hardest errors to forgive will always be his own. Despite its length (870 pages in hard cover), this book barely has a slow moment. Harry and his friends are growing up, and they're doing it in a world gone dark and dangerous.<br />--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of \\"Rough Rider\\"	2004-06-10

In this most complex (and lengthy) book of the series so far, wizard-in-training Harry Potter finds himself drafted into a competition among three wizarding schools. Since he is technically too young to enter, and since partipating is supposed to be voluntary, Harry's not the only person amazed by this. Nevertheless the adults in charge decide to let things proceed.<br />Is there a connection between Harry's name ending up in the \\"goblet of fire\\" with those of older students, who entered the competition on purpose, and a frightening incident during the Quidditch World Cup just before the new school year's start? If so, who is involved? Some of his enemies Harry knows, including the One Who Must Not Be Named. But he has others, apparently - and those he doesn't know about he cannot guard against. Nor can his headmaster and professors, or his friends.<br />In addition to its more involved plot, this book is darker than the three previous ones. Its existing characters gain depth and motivation, while newly introduced characters play significant and appropriate parts. I found it a thoroughly satisfying read.<br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

As Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts with his friends Ron and Hermione for their third year, the young wizard-in-training is under constant watch from the school's staff. Although the Muggle world, including Harry's aunt and uncle from whom he finally fled near summer's end, believes that one Sirius Black is nothing more than an ordinary (although dangerous) escaped convict, the wizards know that Black escaped from their own prison: Azkaban. He'd been there for twelve years, as punishment for his role in the murders of Harry's parents.<br />Despite Dementors (the most horrific prison guards an author ever conceived) surrounding the school, Harry soon has reason to believe that Sirius Black is nearby. The Dementors' effect on the boy wizard makes them almost as dangerous to him as Black may be, though. And what's the secret that the school's new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts is hiding? Is it, too, connected in some mysterious way to Harry's past?<br />This third in J.K. Rowling's series is the best so far. It retains the earlier books' humor, deepens the characterizations of its principals, and unfolds more of an over-arching, multi-volume plot while giving its own story satisfactory resolution. It is a darker tale than the first two. The \\"good vs. evil\\" theme continues to shine through its pages, but we - along with Harry - come to realize that knowing which is which may not always be simple.<br />A \\"read-until-you-finish-it\\" book!	2004-05-29

Rowling	Wizard-in-training Harry Potter's summer with his Muggle aunt, uncle, and cousin hasn't gone well. When an unidentified wizarding family's house elf turns up at the worst possible time, to warn Harry not to go back to Hogwarts School, the elf causes so much trouble that it looks as if Harry may not be allowed back. But with help from the family of his school friend Ron Weasley, Harry returns to Hogwarts anyway - after which someone or something starts turning the wizarding school's students to stone.<br />Who is \\"Slytherin's heir\\"? Is it Hagrid, the groundskeeper who was expelled during his long ago boyhood? Is it Harry's dearest enemy, Draco Malfoy? No one knows. But unless Harry and his friends can find out, soon, the school will have to close.<br />Since I can only take just so much of Harry's horrible Muggle relatives, the opening chapters seem slow to me. Once the Weasleys enter the narrative, though, things pick up. The rest of the tale is a page-turner. Rowling's humor relieves the tension at just the right moments, and the new characters she introduces more than hold their own among those we already know and love (or hate!). Another excellent book in a series destined to join the ranks of children's classics.	2004-05-27

From his decidedly long-range viewpoint, it happens all the time. What he doesn't realize, as he urges his bosses at NOAA to take his prediction seriously, is that the crisis caused by changing ocean currents isn't somewhere decades (or even, hopefully, a few centuries) down the road. It's starting to happen now. And once begun, it will happen with horrifying speed.<br />Sam Hall, seventeen years old and so brilliant that he's often in trouble with intimidated teachers, leaves for an academic competition in New York City just as the storm that will usher in a new ice age begins. This isn't the sort of thing Sam normally does, but spending time with team mate Laura is more than enough inducement. Sam's mother and Jack's ex-wife, Lucy, has a long shift to work as part of her medical residency, back home in Virginia. So as the storm strikes, and as Jack realizes that it's his nightmare coming true, his son becomes trapped in the northern danger zone; while the woman he still loves must choose between evacuation to Mexico and safety, or continuing to do her duty as a doctor.<br />This is a taut thriller with a human heart, and it's much better written than most novelizations of popular films. &quot;Weather Channel Storm Stories&quot; junkies should love it, although any reader who thinks about current events will also find it disturbing. It hits close to home.	2004-05-22

Harry Potter has lived with his aunt, uncle, and cousin ever since he can remember. He sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs, wears his cousin's hand-me-down clothes (which fit him like tents), and spends his leisure time being his cousin's punching bag. But on his eleven birthday, everything changes. Harry finds out that his parents were wizards, and that no one can stop him from entering the Hogwarts School where they were trained. As was the evil wizard who murdered them, and tried to murder the infant Harry - whose lightning-shaped forehead scar still burns whenever there's a supernatural threat afoot.<br />At Hogwarts, Harry tries to balance being as ignorant of his heritage as any \\"Muggle\\" (that's a non-wizard human like the rest of us) with finding himself a ready-made celebrity. Everyone in the wizarding world knows about him, and wonders at him; because no one else has ever survived the dark magic that killed his parents. But being famous can't protect him from friction with jealous classmates, harassment by a professor who hates him on sight, or the consequences of breaking school rules. Which Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione do with alarming frequency, as Harry's curiosity about a mysterious \\"sorcerer's stone\\" turns into an urgent obsession....<br />Classic good vs. evil, \\"hero rises from obscurity to find his destiny\\" tale, with an equally classic English boarding school setting put to excellent use. It's easy to see why this book captures nearly everyone who reads it, and forces purchase of the rest of the series. After all, we all were Harry Potter once in our own minds - a misunderstood child destined for great things. Excellent read!	2004-05-22

Codi Noline, who can barely remember her girlhood in tiny Grace, Arizona, allows herself to feel one kind only. She and younger sister Hallie have been inseparable since their mother's death, three decades ago when Hallie was a newborn baby and Codi a three-year-old. But now agricultural specialist Hallie decides to drive herself to Nicaragua, to help the people there with their crops - just as Grace's only physician, &quot;Doc Homer&quot; Noline, reaches a stage of Alzheimer's at which it's obvious someone must go home and keep an eye on him.<br />So Codi, who finished medical school but discovered during residency that she wasn't cut out to follow in her father's footsteps, leaves her job clerking in a 7-11 and her liaison with a man about whom she has no strong feelings to hold her. She takes a one-year job teaching science at the local high school, and re-connects with her girlhood best friend (who rents Codi a small house next to her own family). Codi never felt at home in Grace before, and she feels totally alien to it now. But staying aloof, maintaining the emotional distance on which she depends for her sense of safety, doesn't work in this place where people she fails to remember insist on recognizing and acknowledging her. Memories she can barely touch pique her curiosity, and so does the slow death of Grace's great treasure, its magnificent orchards. Slowly, the woman who needs no one and doesn't want that to change finds herself connecting with those around her anyway.<br />Family. Community. The environment. The author's usual themes are all here, along with - to my surprise - one of the most touching yet realistic romantic love stories I've ever read. &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; is Kingsolver at her best!	2004-05-16

From the Panhandle to Key West, the state of Florida offers its visitors far more than sunshine and warm temperatures during the year's colder months. Are you interested in a vacation that offers &quot;history and mystery&quot; as well as wonderful food, pleasant surroundings, and plenty of local color? If so, you can't go wrong with this combination travel guide and ghost story collection.<br />Florida, of course, has a right to more ghosts than more recently settled parts of the United States. As Author Walls points out, in 1620 when the Pilgrims reached Plymouth there was already a thriving settlement at St. Augustine. The state's paranormal riches date back even farther than that, though. The inhabitants of Crystal River State Archaeological Site's pre-historic burial mounds make their continuing presence known, as do those of the Timacuan Indian mound just north of the city in Ormond Beach.<br />Tragic lovers. A little girl playing jacks. A farmer who found a much easier (but horrific) way to get rid of his migrant workers than simply paying them for their labors. A doll that, imbued with its departed owner's personality, moves about its museum case and ruins the camera film of anyone who tries to photograph it. An old lady whose body left her beloved home when she died, but whose spirit continues to watch over the place with benevolent interest - except when a female guest's skirt is too short, in which case she tries to pull it lower by the hem! The ghosts that Walls describes are a varied lot, and an intriguing one. I believe I would take her advice about the places of which she says, &quot;If you go there, it is wise to not go alone.&quot;<br />I would also take her advice about bed-and-breakfasts, inns, and eating establishments of all sorts. Her descriptions of these made me want to pull up stakes and head a thousand miles south, to sit on shady verandas and stuff myself with both gourmet and &quot;plain old down home&quot; cooking.

Shall I throw this book across the room because its plot hinges on forcing its heroine to accept her &quot;proper role&quot; as a woman in the mainstream Christianity of the era in which Lewis wrote it? Or shall I enjoy it on its own terms? I had to make up my mind about that as soon as I realized where the author was taking me, and at that point I put it aside overnight. With bookmark removed, because I intended to return it whence it was borrowed without reading further.<br />I found my place again the next evening, and I kept on. I'm glad I did. While certainly I didn't wind up persuaded that birth control is an evil that prevents &quot;preordained&quot; conceptions from taking place, nor did I buy for a minute the notion that Jane Studdock could only gain both salvation and happiness by abandoning her doctoral thesis for a life of childbearing, I found the rest of the book thoroughly entertaining as a dark science fantasy. Lewis's wit more than redeems the rather heavy-handed allegory that the plot doesn't pretend to cloak. He takes myth and Christian doctrine, and settings and characters from his own time and place, and weaves it all together into a fast-moving and memorable tale. If he had only known the first thing about women, instead of sounding always like a bachelor uncle...or if only, as in &quot;Out of the Silent Planet,&quot; he'd had the good sense not to attempt writing them as major characters.	2004-05-03

That is how Ransom comes to the house in the first place, to do the worried old woman a favor by bringing her son home long after his work day should have ended.<br />Ransom accepts refreshments from Weston, whom he knew during their student days. He wakes up on his way to a world whose inhabitants call it Malacandra - the planet we know as Mars.<br />This science fantasy is fast-paced, witty, and thoroughly engaging.

I'm not sure how I managed to miss reading &quot;Captain January&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Star Bright,&quot; during my childhood. I loved the author's humorous, imaginative poetry, but never encountered her prose. I can't guess how I might have responded to it then, but this past winter I found these two books a sweet, old-fashioned delight. What surprises me as I think about them in review mode, though, is how much depth their characters have to offer an adult reader. We find good people doing what they believe to be best, and having it turn out badly (or at least imperfectly) because their &quot;good&quot; reasons contain hidden selfishness. We find flawed people living useful lives anyway, and those who love them accepting those flaws.<br />That's what makes a children's book (so-called) timeless, I suppose. When a &quot;grown-up&quot; can also read it with pleasure and suspended disbelief, it's destined to endure beyond its author's lifetime.	2004-05-03

Its depiction of evil's chilling, banal brutality also takes a strong stomach.<br />With that said, though, Lewis describes the innocent world we know as Venus with detail and poetry.

Born in 1813, \\"Linda Brent\\" (as Harriet Jacobs renames herself) lived to play the role of nurse - as a free woman - during the Civil War. The long journey that took her there began on the day she realized, as a six-year-old who had just become motherless, that she was a slave.<br />The first mistress she served treated little Linda kindly. When the girl was 12 years old, and her mistress died, Linda and her family hoped the will might leave her free. Instead, it bequeathed her to the dead mistress's 5-year-old niece. This placed Linda under the control of Dr. Flint, her new little mistress's father, and his selfish, cruel wife. The slaves of the Flint household were always hungry, often beaten; and, if female and attractive, quite likely to bear Dr. Flint's offspring.<br />Linda Brent refused to submit to her master's advances. Instead she bore two children to another white man, in hopes her lover might buy and free her - which couldn't happen unless Dr. Flint, on behalf of his daughter, proved willing to sell. But Dr. Flint was anything else but willing to part with his uncooperative property. So began a long battle of wits and wills, one that for Linda had the highest stakes imaginable.<br />This well documented true story of a woman's life as property had trouble finding a publisher in its own era. Even today it's not easy reading. Unflinchingly honest even when she's recounting her own errors and weaknesses, Harriet Jacobs leaves the world a priceless legacy in these memoirs of her battle for freedom.<br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

The most interesting difference between movie and book, as far I am concerned, is that despite James Cromwell's fine performance I found the film's Zephram Cochrane incredibly annoying. I never developed a shred of sympathy for him, because the background the film gave me - the Third World War and its chaotic aftermath - wasn't sufficient to make me understand him. I don't know, not having seen the script from which J.M. Dillard worked, whether she added \\"Zef\\" Cochrane's tragic battle with bipolar disorder (a disease that before the War had an effective treatment), or if it was among the elements that inevitably got cut as the film took shape. But I do know that for me, it made all the difference in being able to care about this character and root for him.<br />The book follows the film with little filler added except for background on Lily Sloane and Zephram Cochrane, which gives it a similar pace. They complement each other well.	2004-04-05

Nor do he and his family know the first thing about how to survive in an environment where the very laws of nature operate differently than back home in Georgia, where Orleanna Price and her girls long to be. With the Congo verging on independence, the Missionary League places the Prices there reluctantly and recalls them a few months later when the area becomes too dangerous. But Nathan Price refuses to leave.<br />Although I'm aware of the author's pantheist beliefs, I honestly do not view this lyrical, hysterically funny, yet at times horrifying novel as a condemnation of Christianity and a hymn to natural law. Its characters are too well drawn and too individual for that. Too real for that, especially after tragedy strikes in a way that finally drives Orleanna from her increasingly irrational husband's side. After their daughters scatter, and the story's second half begins.<br />For me this is a book about the choices we humans make, and how those choices interacting with the world around us - physical, natural, and political - lead to consequences none of us can hope to predict.

Karissa Carpenter seeks a new life as a travel nurse, a professional whose agency places her temporarily in hospitals desperate for such help. She has two reasons for escaping her old life. One is her repressive father, a fundamentalist preacher whose God defines a woman's role (and for that matter, any Christian's) with incredible narrowness. The other is the recent loss of her own little family, when the sudden death of her four-week-old daughter ended a marriage she now realizes she never should have entered.<br />In Corpus Christi, far to the south of her Texas Panhandle home town, Karissa takes her third contract nursing job. As a storm blows in from the Gulf, she huddles in her apartment holding her dead baby's quilt to her cheek. It was storming on the night Mariah died. It was storming, also, when newborn babies disappeared from hospitals where Karissa was working in two other cities. She wakes after this storm to learn that a baby has gone missing from her Corpus Christi hospital's nursery.<br />Clues pointing to her guilt abound, and Karissa honestly wonders if she can be to blame even though she has no memory of taking the babies and cannot believe she would do that. With her job threatened by public relations damage control, and her pregnant younger sister arriving in need of a haven, Karissa feels overwhelmed and terrified as never before in her life. But she has something now that she never had before: friends. An older travel nurse, Julie; Dr. Mutabagani, a distinguished neonataologist to whom the Corpus Christi nursery's occupants are &quot;my babies&quot;; and Dr. Braden Marcison, a resident just completing his final rotation, all offer their confidence and support. In fact, Braden Marcison offers Karissa a great deal more than that...but is she ready to accept it?<br />I seldom find myself tearing up while reading a book or watching a movie, but this is the second time I have done just that while reading a book by Melissa S.

There are shades of gray here, and people with real-life imperfections.<br />What fascinates me as I reflect on the book this morning, after finishing it and falling into bed at 2 a.m., is how Karissa finds her greatest strength by learning to trust in her friends and to lean on them, after years of struggling futilely to be totally self-sufficient. That is how we humans become fully ourselves - by connecting with one another.

Makes me roam.&quot;<br />Meanwhile, far away in France, scholars dig in the ruins of a &quot;Dark Ages&quot; fortress and town discreetly bought up by the U.S. corporation for which the dead old man (a noted physicist) worked. The professor supervising both dig and graduate assistant staff disappears. As they puzzle over his absence, his students discover a note in his handwriting. &quot;Help me,&quot; it says. A note on parchment, and in ink, from the time whose artifacts they're uncovering.<br />Meticulous in both its historical detail and its scientific speculation, this pulse-pounding, plot-twisting thriller held my interest from first word to last. My only criticism (as always seems to be the case for me with this author) is that for all the time I spent with his characters, I didn't get to know them very well.<br />Which won't stop me from buying another Crichton novel soon.

Tamara Anderson doesn't remember the last time her family lived in a community, because back then she was three years old. That's how many rented houses ago? Every year her father moves them to a new location, because he's a landscape painter and every year he requires a new vista.<br />So Tamara, Robert, and Megan's only on-going relationships must be with each other and with their parents. For Liz Anderson, her husband is her only friend in the world. She spends her considerable energies supplementing her children's public education, and embarrasses Tamara with frequent letters to whatever school her eldest is currently attending. Making sure the authorities know that the Andersons are devout atheists, civil rights advocates, and so on. Views which, in 1954, are flash points for the rural communities where her husband's work takes them.<br />Only now, as the story of the family's four months in Mayfield, New York begins, an overwhelmingly weary Liz seldom rouses herself to write such letters. She can barely drive her youngsters to the library. When the Murphys, a poor but lively Baptist family across the rural road from the Andersons' rented farm, invite the children to church, Liz tries to argue but winds up letting fifteen-year-old Tamara and the younger ones go. Partly because she must honor their intellectual curiosity about religion, but mostly because she's simply too tired to debate the issue.<br />Tamara's summer to grow up has arrived. Whether or not she's ready, she must look at her parents as people and face their mortality. For the first time since she can remember, their island within the larger world can no longer operate self-sufficiently. Liz's illness forces them to accept help which the Murphys offer-as do their landlords, a Methodist couple who moved out of the farmhouse after their only child (a boy just a year older than Tamara) died there.<br />\\"Just another coming of age novel\\" this is not.

Cloned from drops of blood that survived the aeons because the insects that ingested them became trapped in tree sap that subsequently turned to amber, John Hammond's dinosaurs populate the most unique amusement park ever conceived. The most unique, and also the most dangerous.<br />On the Costa Rican mainland, three-toed lizards are attacking helpless humans. Babies, small children, soundly sleeping elders. When the fragmentary remains of one such lizard find their way to the United States, they pique the interest of paleontologist Alan Grant - who before he can inspect them is summoned to Hammond's island. The aging entrepreneur needs all the allies he can enlist as the EPA begins probing his mysterious venture, and who better than the world's leading dinosaur expert (who has advised Hammond before) to assure the authorities that all is well at Jurassic Park?<br />Of course all is not well there, but Hammond believes in his park so strongly that he brings in his two young grandchildren to join the inspection tour. Which coincides with a site visit by the computer programmer responsible for Jurassic Park's complex and power-hungry operating systems...a programmer who has industrial espionage on his mind.<br />I saw the film version of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; years ago, but didn't catch up with the novel until now. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Although I wouldn't accuse it of having deeply realized characters (the film actually does a better job with the children, in particular), its pounding excitement and solid science more than compensate; and its ending is far more haunting than that of the film.

Derrick Thornton, a girl growing up in a small Ohio town before the First World War, swears to herself that one day she'll be a great writer. Encouraged by a mother who sacrificed her own budding artistic career to bear and rear a family, young Derrick goes off to college - moves, with several of her chums, into a New York City apartment - and goes to work for a newspaper. As the War to End All Wars rages, she publishes her first poems, works on a play, and discovers that she's in love (despite her best intentions otherwise) with a childhood friend.<br />All that sounds tame, doesn't it? A typical coming of age novel, feminine style. Yet in reading this first novel by the author of ...And Ladies of the Club, I found myself reminded over and over again of just how much social upheaval my grandmother's generation (which happens to also be Derrick's generation) created during its young adult years. While I don't agree with Santmyer's generalizations about women's ambitions vs. those of men, her characterizations are vivid and the story she tells is compelling. First published in 1925, this book stands the test of time very well indeed.	2003-12-30

James Augustin Barnabas Flute, otherwise known as \\"Tin,\\" was born on a Thursday. Which, according to his older sister Harper who narrates this dark coming-of-age novel, fated him to his wanderings. An older Harper looks back on her not quite seven-year-old self and remembers the day when her youngest brother Caffy was born - the day when Tin stopped being the impoverished family's baby, which is also the day when Tin learned how to dig.<br />The family's story from then on diverges from Tin's, as the small boy slowly transforms into a wild creature whose home is a self-created network of tunnels beneath their shanty. Most of the time Tin is invisible to the others, a person lost - less and less human, as time passes - yet still loved. Still one of their own.<br />This literary novel's premise borders on speculative fiction, with wonderfully creepy effect. Tin's life intersects with those of his family at crisis points throughout the story, as their already difficult existence becomes ever more so. What will this wild and often frightening child bring his loved ones in the end? Will he be their doom - their salvation - or both?<br />Despite its darkness, which at times feels extreme, \\"Thursday's Child\\" is a book beautifully written and a story expertly told.

Although Manticore's current government finds it politically expedient to delay an official cessation of hostilities for as long as possible (after all, it would be very inconvenient to lose the extra revenues that the on-going state of war justifies!), the Star Kingdom's people and its Royal Navy certainly don't want combat to resume. For nearly 900 pages author Weber keeps his readers guessing, right along with the major players from both sides of the conflict, not so much as to whether or not that will happen - but HOW it will happen.<br />I'm very thankful that \\"War of Honor\\" was not the first Honor Harrington book I'd ever read. If I hadn't already known and cared deeply about the characters, I can't imagine that I would have read more than a chapter or two before putting this one aside.

I understand the parallels between the military and political slippery slope on which the former \\"Peeps\\" and the \\"Manties\\" find themselves, and the one on which Duchess and Steadholder Harrington and Earl White Haven find themselves in private life.

In the far past of an alien world, the line of the Night Kings ends with a prince too cowardly to take Uramtali - the goddess of the Well of Souls, the immortal dithparu - into his body. On present-day (2336) Farius Prime, a place not visited by decent or even prudent Federation citizens, Commander Samir al-Halad battles his ugly past in hope of saving the few people from that past who matter to him - and of keeping the person he loves most in his new life alive, too. Aboard the starship Enterprise, Captain Rachel Garrett grieves for a friend and first officer whose life she couldn't save; damns herself for letting that XO's replacement, Halad, go on \\"R & R\\" at a time when she desperately needs backup; and fences by subspace communications with a Betazoid xeno-archaeologist who is her still-beloved ex-husband. She's missed their son's twelfth birthday, and can't even manage a conversation with young Jason now without having her ship's needs interrupt it.<br />I spent the first half of \\"Well of Souls\\" wondering how the author would bring together these and at least one other story line. Bick's characters captured me immediately as each appeared, and her graphically written action scenes proved wrenching because I cared about the people experiencing them. But what did Samir al-Halad's secrets, Rachel Garrett's ex-husband (on his way to a dig in Cardassian space that Ven Kaldarren knows isn't a much better place for young Jason than a starship, but what else can a father with full physical custody do except take the boy along?), Lieutenant Commander Darya Bat-Levi's efforts to fit in on her new assignment aboard Enterprise, and the Night Kings from long ago all have to do with each other?<br />It comes together beautifully in the book's second half. What lifts this one above many other Trek novels for me is the way Bick (a psychiatrist who writes Starfleet counselors with resulting insight, and to her credit shows her \\"other profession\\" warts and all) infuses the whole work with depth and theme.

The two elderly but still active scientists supply the challenges Polly needs with their unique brand of home schooling, and their oldest grandchild savors the peace and undivided attention after a childhood spent as the oldest in a brood of seven. The calm of rural New England in autumn doesn't last, though. The Murry house sits on a spot that 3,000 years ago was considered sacred by those who lived in their valley then, and a retired Episcopal bishop who's their nearest neighbor has inadvertently opened a time gate to that era.<br />Zachary Grey, the self-absorbed young man who appears in several earlier L'Engle books (particularly the Austin series), shares Polly and Bishop Colubra's ability to pass through the gate and to see ancient folk who make the reverse trip. When the gate closes with that unlikely trio on its other side, Polly soon finds herself revered as a goddess - and at risk, made far more deadly by Zachary's cowardly actions, of being sacrificed by tribal leaders desperate to bring their drought-stricken people rain.<br />Of all the later L'Engle time novels, this one came closest to spinning the same magic spell for me that the first book did. It has the same wonder and excitement, but with a slightly harder edge that comes from having a slightly older and more experienced heroine.

She remembers those warnings, and wishes she hadn't kept them from her parents, as her trip unfolds and one mysterious event follows after another.<br />I was a bit disappointed that Vicky's extraordinary experiences in A RING OF ENDLESS LIGHT, the book before this one in the Austin Series, play no part in TROUBLING A STAR. We hear about her beloved grandfather's death and her budding romance with Adam Eddington when Vicky thinks of last summer, but the dolphins with whom she communicated so remarkably seem forgotten.

To the Austin family from Thornhill, Connecticut, it's simultaneously Sin City and a place where they have settled in to make a temporary home. Small Rob has ventured for the first time into a world of boys and men, by opting for a nearby cathedral's parochial school instead of going with his older sisters Suzy and Vicky. The family has taken two waifs into its bosom: Emily Gregory, their landlord's blind and motherless daughter; and Josiah \\"Dave\\" Davidson, a former gang member who reads Emily her lessons.<br />How are Emily, Dave, Dave's father who works in the cathedral's maintenance department, the cathedral's dean, and a visiting Anglican canon connected to the research that the Austin children's father is mysteriously conducting during this year off from his country medical practice? That's the key to a mystery which Rob, Suzy, and Vicky all realize - at different times and in different ways - is threatening their family, too.<br />L'Engle's two previous Austin books, and the one following this in the series, have Vicky as first-person narrator. I found myself missing her voice as I read, but I quickly realized why the author chose to tell this story in the third person. That approach enables us to follow the story from many different viewpoints. Having it unfold through Vicky's eyes alone would not, for this young adult thriller, produce a tale even half as satisfying.<br />This is the first L'Engle book that I've read as an adult and found it dated.

She hasn't been able to do anything right (or it seems that way to her, at least!) for months, and now her parents have decided to tear her previously secure world apart. Dr. Austin is taking a temporary research and teaching position in New York City, leaving his small-town medical practice in another doctor's hands. The Austin family's home in Thornhill, Connecticut will be occupied by that other doctor's family, and that's where their pets will remain, too. But before they move into a New York apartment, the Austins embark on a cross-country camping trip - from Atlantic (Grandfather Eaton's home on Seven Bay Island) to Pacific (Laguna Beach, California, where they visit Uncle Douglas and Aunt Elena) and back.<br />It's an eventful trip during which Vicky has her first taste of romance, as she meets and is followed all the way across the country by a troubled and sometimes frightening rich boy named Zachary Grey. Zach's angry, hopeless response to life (which he fears losing at any moment, thanks to a rheumatic fever damaged heart) forces Vicky to confront twin demons that are making her own life miserable, in what L'Engle sensitively yet unsentimentally presents as something more than typical teen-aged angst. Vicky is part of the first generation to grow up under the shadow of the atom bomb, becoming aware of world events and their significance at the Cold War and nuclear arms race's height (this book's copyright date is 1963). She's become old enough, during her \\"difficult year\\" of being 14, to realize that she and everyone she loves can die at any moment; and she's also become old enough to ask herself whether or not God is really there. The love and respect she has for her grandfather, a minister and former missionary, can't save her from wondering if Zachary and others like him may not be right.<br />Although I didn't find THE MOON BY NIGHT as enjoyable a read as other L'Engle books because it was a bit too introspective for me (I'm used to more action and dialog, and missed it sorely as I ploughed through page after page of interior monologue), it is nevertheless the one I would most recommend to today's young readers. I was just a little bit younger in 1963 than Vicky Austin, and I remember only too well how it felt to know that my generation might not live to grow up - much less middle-aged or old - thanks to a world suddenly grown far smaller and more dangerous than the one in which our parents came of age.

Twelve-year-old Vicky Austin has a secure and happy home with her physician father, homemaker mother, older brother John, and younger siblings Suzy and Rob, in their big house outside a small American town. The Austins practice an unpretentious but fully committed brand of Christianity, and despite normal squabbling and adolescent angst their elder daughter knows she is surrounded by love and treasures it.<br />Then Maggy Hamilton, ten years old and newly orphaned, lands in their midst and does her best to change everything. For a time this little girl who has never known a real home before does a good job of disrupting the Austins' lives. To Maggy, toys are for breaking (her rich grandfather will replace them on demand, so why not?) and so are rules. Yet like all children, Maggy desperately wants to be loved. Can the Austins love her in spite of her obnoxious behavior? Or will her presence tear their happy family apart?<br />The answer to that question may be predictable, but the way it happens isn't predictable at all. Vicky as narrator has a sweet but decidedly not saccharine voice, and an outlook on life as a budding woman that when this story was first published (copyright 1960) was positively revolutionary. I particularly love the way L'Engle imbues this and many of her other books with a matter-of-fact yet profound spiritual dimension, by depicting Christians who live their faith as if that were the most natural thing in the world.<br />I'm surprised I didn't find this book when I was at the age level for which it was written, since in 1960 I was 8 years old. However, all really fine children's literature can also be enjoyed by adult readers; and that's especially true of Madeleine L'Engle's work.

But wait a minute - exactly where are the implacable Cylons now? Why do this world's natives so closely resemble the Nomen, whom we met in this series' earlier books? Who is the real father of Cassiopeia's baby? And why can't ibooks hire competent editors?<br />Answers to the Cylons' apparent loss of interest, the Paradis natives' mysterious history, and whether or not Cassie's child was fathered by Commander Apollo, you may or may not find in this book. I won't spoil it by telling you more, except to say that you and I will both have to read the next one because this installment ends with a truly diabolical cliffhanger. To that I can only say: WELL DONE! To copy editing snafus so creative and numerous that I occasionally found myself guffawing when the authors definitely didn't intend that as a reader reaction, and to story editing glitches that nagged at me even after I'd finished, I have no answer. Worth reading, especially for a devoted Galactica fan like yours truly? Yes, emphatically. But worth the price of the hardcover? I intended to wait for the paperback, and I probably should have. Nevertheless I'm giving it 3.5 stars, and rounding upward, because you can bet I will keep reading this uneven yet intriguing series.	2003-11-09

The Victorian Era's literature filled my childhood, and its poets (along with the Romantics) remain my favorites. I picked up this biography knowing I would find it interesting, but I didn't anticipate reading it as I would a novel.<br />That's just what happened, though. The author achieves such readability (even, I would think, for those who don't share my interest in European history) by focusing on her subject as if Victoria were a fictional protagonist. While Woodham-Smith supplies the necessary level of detail and background, and demonstrates the solid research skills that make this a serious work, she never forgets that the reason most readers pick up this book is - Victoria! A monarch who was also girl and woman, daughter and sister, wife and mother, in an era when each of those roles conflicted wildly with the one that destiny called on her to play.<br />Long out of print, but well worth tracking down.	2003-11-07

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Part satire, part social commentary, part character study	\\"The story of how I got from the FloridaLand Trailer Park just outside of Brooksville, Florida to become a real live Hollywood celebrity began near the end of July,\\" narrator Alice Sparrow tells us as WHERE IS WONDERLAND ANYWAY opens. Author Bryson continues in Alice's matter-of-fact, delightfully dry voice throughout the book, making it an easy read.<br />Part satire in the best Lewis Carroll tradition - part social commentary - and part character study, Alice's story will pull you in and keep you reading. Despite the author's use of stereotypes and dropping of slightly altered celebrity names (which she does slyly, for humorous effect; and with consistent success), even her minor characters take on independent existence because they don't remain cliches. They stay that way just long enough for the reader to recognize and place them. After that they're quickly fleshed out, and you care about them. Even the ones you want to smack!<br />What I like best about Alice Sparrow is how she turns one particular social and literary stereotype, Woman-as-Victim, on its head. I hate that stereotype. Therefore, I can't help loving Alice (and Karen Mueller Bryson) for making me laugh at it so heartily.	2003-11-02

Why, or WHY, have only male felines as protagonists? Through all 17 stories? What an odd editorial decision (or weird coincidence, to give the editor the benefit of the doubt).<br />With that pet peeve of *this* cat-loving science fiction writer soundly petted (I've got six girls and only one guy-cat in my current menagerie), my highest compliments go to Elizabeth Ann Scarborough for &quot;Born Again&quot; and to Anne Braude for &quot;The Quincunx Solution.&quot; In each of these very different tales, we have a cat who is simply that - a feline without any telepathic, telekinetic or other special powers - responding in kind to his human companion's love and devotion. Each tale has plenty of fantastic elements (this is a scifi/fantasy anthology, after all!), but its feline hero remains delightfully ordinary in the midst of extraordinary happenings. That's why these two stories pleased me most, because they capture so beautifully the bond between human and companion animal.<br />With one exception, the rest of the tales kept me reading and made me glad the editor saw fit to include them. The one that I stopped reading after a few pages had almost no dialog, with the writer spending most of her prose providing backstory - which indicates to me that this particular tale would have been better as a novella, at least (or maybe even as a novel). Its author clearly needed a great deal more space than the short story format provides in order to tell her story engagingly.<br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

The Lyon family of &quot;methody&quot; Capella are Talented folk. This means that they possess telepathic and telekinetic abilities in varying degrees and combinations, although none has the power of a &quot;Prime.&quot; Young Afra chafes under the emotional repression and strict propriety of his home-world, and delights in his beloved older sister Goswina's brief apprenticeship to the Rowan - the most powerful Prime Talent known to FT&amp;T.<br />As a young man, Afra has his own chance to work with the Rowan. He and that lonely woman strike up a rare and wonderful friendship, destined to endure throughout their lifetimes. But romance isn't part of their synergy, and both yearn to find it with other partners. Which the Rowan does, eventually, with an equally powerful but untrained telepath from Deneb: Jeff Raven. Whom she marries, and partners with when FT&amp;T's &quot;Talents&quot; are the only viable defense against an alien invasion.<br />The Rowan and Jeff Raven produce a family of Talented children, including a daughter named Damia. From childhood, this third in their brood proves herself the most Talented human yet born. She's also temperamental, strong-willed, and unpredictable; and the most important person in her life, from its earliest hours, proves to be her mother's friend and colleague Afra.<br />Although this book includes some thrilling passages of interstellar conflict carried out by telepathic and telekinetic means, the romance of Damia Gwyn-Raven and Afra Lyon forms its heart and occupies most of its pages. I'm not quite sure how I feel about this romance. The author handles Afra's transition from parental figure to suitor in Damia's life well enough, and there is certainly nothing wrong with a grown woman (even a rather young one) choosing to marry an older man. Nevertheless I came away with residual discomfort, because even McCaffrey couldn't quite convince me that this close friend of Damia's mother (in an emotional sense, her uncle) had any business sharing her bed.<br />I loved the &quot;coonies&quot; and the Barque Cats, though! And since I've read the rest of the Talent series already, I know that Damia and Afra's marriage is destined to mature into a genuine and healthy partnership. So I would advise other readers to be forewarned that &quot;Damia&quot; may disturb them a little, but I recommend it just the same.siness sharing her bed.<br />I loved the &quot;coonies&quot; and the Barque Cats, though!

Hannah Wilcox, heroine of J.A. Terry's debut novel of romantic suspense, proves that truism wrong; but her homecoming to the village of Willaville carries a high cost.<br />Hannah has spent the years since she left Willaville building a successful career, and nurturing a loving (although not exactly passionate) marriage to a man who understood and respected her need to keep her own financial and professional identity. Widowed now and wealthy, she dreams of her girlhood home and feels herself drawn there. Despite memories of a dark presence that drove her parents to sell that house and move elsewhere, Hannah purchases the old place and accepts a surprise invitation to her high school reunion. The biggest surprise about that invitation is that the classmate organizing the reunion didn't send it - but Hannah doesn't find that out until she is already embroiled in both the old house's enduring mystery, and her old classmates' enduring feuds and friendships.<br />I expected Hannah's romance with Jeremy Larson, a local physician on whom she had a crush during their school days, to be the book's focus. To a great extent that's true, but their relationship (touching though it is) isn't what impressed me most. Hannah's conflicts and reconnections with her girlhood chums are beautifully written and astonishingly realistic. J.A. Terry has a wonderful sense of what women's friendships mean to those lucky enough to share them, and of the duality of good and evil in the soul of every human being. Her cliffhanger chapter endings kept me reading far into the night, but the best thing about this tale is the realistic way its characters (male and female alike) grow and change - both for better, and for worse - in response to the challenges they face.<br />Highly recommended!<br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

Vicky Austin knows that this will be her last summer on Seven Bay Island with her beloved grandfather, because the scholarly retired clergyman is dying of a fast-moving form of leukemia. 15-year-old Vicky stands on the dividing line between childhood and adulthood. As a budding poet, she promises to retain childhood's heightened and sometimes painful sensitivities even after she crosses that border. That's a bond she shares with her grandfather, but not with the rest of her loving yet far more scientifically inclined family.<br />Complicating this already trying time for Vicky are three young men. Leo, a lifelong friend of her family, wants more from her than the companionship and sympathy she is ready to offer him. Zachary, a severely troubled and wealthy youth who was her first real boyfriend, follows her to Seven Bay Island and alternately charms and frightens her with attentions that her family would prefer she didn't accept. And Adam, her older brother John's friend from MIT, assumes an important place in her life when he discovers that Vicky's extraordinary (and unexpected, and unexplained) ability to communicate with dolphins can transform his summer project at the Island's oceanographic research station.<br />While Vicky's romantic and other feelings for this trio are central to the story, this is not a conventional tale of young love in which the girl's choice of suitor is the whole point. Vicky Austin is a complete person, and not about to treat romance at age 15 as the be-all and end-all of her life so far; nor as the defining influence on her future. Until now she has been something of a misfit, with her physician father and scientifically inclined older brother and younger sister tech-talking over her head. This summer, finally, \\"dreamy Vicky\\" who often slips away to write verses comes into her own. Which, as so often happens in real life, can only occur as she is tested by life. And by death, and by her responses to both.<br />L'Engle at her finest! Although I'm of grandmotherly years now, \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" was among my own girlhood's defining books.

The Yuuzhan Vong, aliens who deplore machines (their own technology is entirely bio-based), are overrunning the galaxy. When their forces collide with the Imperial Remnant, the retreating Remnant encounters what used to be its worst enemy - Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, traveling in his wife and fellow Jedi Master Mara Jade's starship (with nephew Jedi Knight Jacen Solo also aboard) toward the fabled sentient planet Zonama Sekot in search of a way to defeat the Vong.<br />This complex novel is the first Star Wars book I've read since Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy, in which Leia Organa Solo's twin children Jacen and Jaina were born. Without the timeline and book list in its front, I'm sure I would have been lost; and even with that to aid me, I still had a bit of trouble sorting out the vast cast of characters and comprehending references to previous events (especially those relating to the death of the third Solo offspring, Anakin). However, this is a book meant to be read by fans following a series. So I cannot hold my difficulties against its authors, and I must in fact compliment them on making things as easy for me as they did.<br />With that said, this is a well-paced, exciting story. The Yuuzhan Vong are a fascinating people, and the relationships among the familiar Star Wars characters (especially Leia and Han) have developed over the years with believable complexity. I'm not sure I want to go looking for all the books in the series now, but I've enjoyed reading this one. It is satisfying to read a media tie-in novel that allows its characters to grow, change, and even suffer wrenching losses, instead of being essentially the same at the story's end.

But what is a family, anyway? Why is this concept such an important one, and how does it change from one culture to another?<br />When Taylor Greer reluctantly fell in love - not with a man, but with an abused and terrified little girl abandoned in her car - she found out, day by day and challenge by challenge, what motherhood meant. \\"Pigs in Heaven\\" opens three years after the conclusion of \\"The Bean Trees,\\" in which Taylor adopted Turtle (so named because of the way the child hung onto her) by typically unconventional means. Turtle is a happy and healthy six-year-old now, and Taylor has settled into an uncommitted but loving domestic partnership with a man who adores them both. Mother and daughter are visitng the Hoover Dam, on a vacation that professional musician Jax can't share, when Turtle is the only witness to a retarded man's accident. The resulting rescue puts mother and daughter on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Where idealistic Cherokee attorney Annawake Fourkiller sees them, hears Taylor tell Oprah how she came to adopt her daughter, and realizes that Turtle - a child of color \\"found\\" by a white woman during a trip across Oklahoma - must surely be a fellow Cherokee.<br />Annawake Fourkiller visits Taylor Greer to let her know that under the Indian Child Welfare Act, Turtle still belongs to her tribe no matter what legal proceeding may have given her to anyone else. The young lawyer doesn't anticipate what Taylor promptly does - which, of course, is run. Leaving Jax behind in a heartbeat, along with every other part of her support system, she takes to the road because it seems like the only sure way to keep her daughter.<br />What follows is an odyssey of discovery not just for Taylor and Turtle, but (although she doesn't travel as far as they do physically) for Annawake Fourkiller as well. Not to mention for Taylor's mother, Alice, who comes west from Kentucky after her recent second marriage expires from boredom; for Jax, who stays behind in Tucson; and for Cash Stillwater, an aging Cherokee who returns to the tribe after leaving it several years earlier when he lost his mother, wife, and adult daughter, all within a few months of each other.<br />\\"Pigs in Heaven\\" is another of Kingsolver's marvelous depictions of human nature as it really is.

Entomologist Lusa Landowski's year-old marriage to farmer Cole Widener ends with his death, as the summer of Barbara Kingsolver's fifth novel begins. That leaves city-reared Lusa to learn by herself, quickly, what she was trying to learn slowly with her husband's help: how to live on the land (something she always dreamed of doing), and how to fit herself into his large and contentious family (something that she, the only child of aging parents, never imagined).<br />On a mountain above the Widener farm, Deanna Wolfe - a wildlife biologist almost 20 years Lusa's senior - lives in a primitive cabin and doesn't come down to civilization, even for vacations. She is the one authorized human resident of a game preserve, where she keeps the trails open - sends poachers packing - and watches the cycle of life and death, predators and prey, play itself out as season follows season. She's content there, but not enough to send an attractive wanderer named Eddie Bondo on his way.<br />Retired agriculture teacher Garnett Walker III lives near the Widener farm, and works at breeding a blight-resistant American chestnut tree. That will be his legacy, now that his wife is dead and his only son estranged. If his neighbor and nemesis - organic farmer and free spirit (despite her own advancing years) Nannie Rawley - doesn't drive him crazy first, that is!<br />What ties together these people from three different generations, except inhabiting the southern Appalachians through a summer that is truly &quot;prodigal&quot; in its bounty? What do &quot;Moth Love&quot; (the title for each of Lusa Landowski's chapters), &quot;Predators&quot; (Deanna Wolfe's chapters), and &quot;Old Chestnuts&quot; (Garnett Walker III's chapters) have in common? For each of Kingsolver's characters, this bountiful yet trying summer reveals unsuspected connections and teaches fresh (yet age old) lessons about nature. Human, and otherwise. As their lives reach turning points and summer ends, each discovers something new and startling - and wonderful! - about what being part of creation really means.<br />An absorbing, thought-provoking read, in which the natural world becomes a living and breathing character all its own.

Her husband beats her unconscious, causing her to miscarry a much-wanted first child.  And then, at age 23, she finds out that she's adopted!<br />That sounds like the makings of a soap opera, not a cross-genre novel so intriguing that I wound up taping my favorite TV show so I could go on reading it.

I finished the story in tears.  I cared that much about the characters, and found their tale's resolution that satisfying.<br />The best thing about \\"Amercan Woman American Strong,\\" though, isn't the author's storytelling and characterization skills.  It's her refusal to retreat into cliches and pop psychobabble, as Arianna uncovers secret after secret on a cross-continental journey into the history of both her families.  The one that reared and loved and shaped her, and the one that gave her birth.<br />Arianna and the women who came before her could all too easily have been painted by the author as powerless victims.  Instead they are fully fleshed human beings, even the \\"worst\\" of whom has strengths as well as weaknesses and admirable qualities as well as deplorable ones.  Like any other real people(!), they live out their lives as best they can within the cultural and economic boundaries of their times - and the author, unlike many other writers depicting women in difficult circumstances, never fails to show them the respect they deserve.

Not to mention for their official mating, at the Summer Meeting of all the caves of the Zelandonii.  Telling the stories of their travels, bringing home the spirit of Jondalar's brother who set off with him and died along the way, and introducing his fascinated yet frightened people to Ayla's animal friends (the horses Whinney and Racer, and the four-legged hunter Wolf), would be enough to deal with; but of course the young couple soon learn that there's more.<br />Zelandoni, the Ninth Cave's spiritual guardian and healer, recognizes Ayla immediately as one of her own calling.

Battle with the alien Chitain fleet has cost the colonial fleet a terrible price. As Commander Apollo decides to take his remaining people and ships to coordinates provided by a newly discovered holocube that maps the expansion across the galaxy of the now-vanished Thirteenth Tribe of Kobol, Commander Cain (\\"The Living Legend\\") challenges both his leadership and his decision. With food, fuel, and other resources running perilously low, Cain believes the fleet must make its stand instead of risking this journey into the unknown.<br />Apollo prevails for the moment, and the fleet soon finds itself at the Thirteenth Tribe's starting point. Kobol, home planet to their race. It's now (apparently) deserted and barren, blasted by the ancient Cylons just as viciously as the Twelve Colonies were by modern Cylons at the start of the fleet's own 20-yahren journey. Before this adventure is over, Apollo's closest and lifelong friend Starbuck will lie dead (no, this is not a spoiler - read the book to find out why!). His long romance with Cain's daughter, his comrade-in-arms Sheba, will end because he can't let go of his dead wife Serina. His sister and colleague Athena will join with another once-staunch ally, Council President Tighe, in supporting Cain's renewed challenge for control of the fleet; and the allied Cylon and Chitain fleets will find the Colonials again, at Kobol.<br />It appears that I enjoyed this book a great deal more than did other readers who've posted their reviews. Yes, I noticed the editing errors. They were distracting, but by no means spoiled the book for me. I thought it much better written than \\"Warhawk,\\" in which we first met the Chitains. My only complaints are that Apollo's breakup with Sheba apparently took place off camera, which left me feeling cheated; and that some of Apollo's interior monologue scenes served the unfortunate purpose of \\"telling instead of showing.\\"<br />With that said, I found the story generally well paced, exciting, and filled with surprises.

In order to put down a rebellion by Earth's huge population of sentient holograms, Starfleet (as the Doctor's \\"owner\\") has decided to make an example of him.<br />Admiral Kathryn Janeway isn't about to let such things happen to her people.  With close friend and former first officer Chakotay by her side, aided by Tom Paris, Harry Kim, and others whom Trek fans will recognize, Janeway sets out to rescue her endangered friends from detention.  After that she'll have to find the real source of the assimilation virus, and expose it to Starfleet and Federation authorities.  If she can't do all of that within a frighteningly brief time frame, though, it will be too late.  Earth will already have become part of a vast Collective.<br />I enjoyed the first \\"Homecoming\\" book, but this one is better (I'd give it 4 ½ stars if that were possible).  It spends far less time telling regular Voyager viewers what we already know, and it contains (mercifully) only one encounter between Janeway and her former fiance Mark Johnson's insipid bride, Carla.  Maybe that's why Janeway seems solidly in character throughout the book.  The mystery's solution works quite well despite making use of a motivation that's become a literary and dramatic clich&eacute; in recent years, and that in my opinion feeds a social prejudice which doesn't need help from Star Trek authors.  I would like to comment on this at greater length, but won't because I'd be giving away too much.

If you are looking for another book &quot;just like MRS. MIKE,&quot; I'm afraid that THE SEARCH FOR JOYFUL will disappoint you. It's about a different young woman's journey out of girlhood, set in an entirely different era even though it begins just one generation after the classic tale of a Canadian Mountie's bride. While Katherine Mary Flannigan is among its characters, this is her adopted daughter's story. I'm glad I was able to put aside my preconceptions and let Kathy Forquet take me along on her own unique journey, because I found it a very rewarding trip.<br />This Kathy, as readers of MRS. MIKE will remember, came into the lives of Mike and Kathy Flannigan after their one-time household helper - the Cree girl Oh-Be-Joyful, who ran away to marry a half-breed trapper named Jonathan Forquet - died and left a baby daughter behind. Jonathan brought the child to the woman his young wife had called her &quot;more than sister,&quot; and the Flannigans added the little girl to their adopted twins. Who, with their French ancestry, fit in among the northern Alberta village's white youngsters; while small copper-skinned Kathy, a First Nation child growing up in a white family, fit in nowhere except at home. &quot;Kathy is to be included,&quot; Mrs. Mike consistently told Connie and Georges. But as her story opens, Kathy Forquet is striking out on her own for the first time - to answer her country's World War II call for young women to study nursing - and merely being &quot;included&quot; is no longer enough.<br />In the cosmopolitan city of Montreal, she find a profession to excel at and to love. She also finds prejudice among her fellow nursing students, and even - eventually - in the family of the young man she marries. But there is another young man, a fellow &quot;Indian&quot; also serving in the Canadian Army; and there are friends like Kathy's roommate Mandy, her old schoolmate Elk Girl, and &quot;Sister Egg.&quot;<br />Through study and hard work, through coming under enemy fire in a front-line medical unit, through loving and losing and learning to love again, young Kathy journeys just as far in this book as her adoptive mother did in MRS. MIKE. It is written with more frankness because it was, after all, published 50 years later. If you're planning to hand it to your child, be warned about that! But I personally thought it well done, and well worth reading.under enemy fire in a front-line medical unit, through loving and losing and learning to love again, young Kathy journeys just as far in this book as her adoptive mother did in MRS.

On the other side it is 1713. John Hallett, desperate to find help for his pregnant daughter Maria, calls out across time - and obstetrician Angus McPherson answers. With no idea of just how far that walk across an innocent-looking field will take him, as he quickly learns why no midwife or physician from her time will help his new patient give birth.<br />Her fellow villagers in coastal Yarmouth believe that Maria Hallett is a witch. So as the unmarried girl struggles to bear the son of pirate Black Sam Bellamy (who of course is off at sea), no one but her shamed yet loving family wants to come near her.<br />Dr. Angus soon find himself in love with Maria, and offers her the protection that can only come from marriage. For her he willingly remains in the past, learns how to live there, and does his best to teach his bride to love him. But Maria, although she's grateful, has no intention of giving up on Black Sam Bellamy's promised return.<br />Not counting &quot;Brigadoon,&quot; this was my first time travel romance. I've avoided the whole sub-genre because, to be honest, it sounded just plain silly to this lover of hard science fiction. I was agreeably surprised to find myself sitting up until all hours, reading this book straight through to its end, because I simply had to know what would happen to the characters!<br />If you enjoy a mildly spicy romance, with mystery woven into the plot and a touch of magic that's applied with a light hand (just enough to make the story work), you will like this one for sure.	2003-06-16

I literally can't remember when I read this book for the first time. What I do recall is how much I enjoyed it, although I certainly was too young to understand the romance between Katherine Mary O'Fallon of Boston and Sgt. Mike Flannigan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. To me it was simply a grand adventure set in the Far North, with (always a plus!) a young woman protagonist.<br />I finished re-reading \\"Mrs. Mike\\" last night, and I know exactly why it's considered a classic. Everything I loved about it in my girlhood is still there, with the grand adventure even more powerful to my more realistic adult imagination - but now the rest of the story is accessible to me as well. And I can only say: Magnificent! Because this is that rare and wonderful thing, a love story about women and men as they really are. The stark realism of life as Kathy and Mike face it, in a land that's isolated, dangerous, and at times nightmarishly brutal, makes the happiness they find together shine all the more brightly. It also gives new meaning to the phrase \\"dearly bought.\\" The same applies to the friendships Kathy finds with other women, each of whom is a memorable character in her own right.<br />I am so glad I visited these old friends again!	2003-06-05

Chloe Evans and her six-year-old son Jeremy both have wounds that need healing, as they move to the small Oregon town of Jack Pine and away from the city where Chloe's former husband harassed them constantly. With a new dispatcher's job at the county sheriff's office, plus plenty of hope and courage, the young woman sets out to make a new and safe life for her son. Starting with getting him the puppy he's always wanted, even though she knows they can barely afford the extra expense of its care.<br />The puppy promptly comes down with parvovirus, and the local vet wants a substantial deposit before beginning treatment. Even then, it's probably hopeless. But that's a word that neither Chloe nor Jeremy is good at hearing - and just before the puppy becomes ill, Chloe literally bumps into the town's other vet at the feed store.<br />The other vet, who's licensed but no longer in practice, is a part-Shoshone who lives on isolated Cinnamon Ridge with his dementia-afflicted mother and a wolf-dog named Diablo. Which frightens Chloe and Jeremy more, the (apparently) aptly named Diablo or his owner, Ben Longtree, it's hard to say at first. But Longtree is the only person who may possibly be able to save Jeremy's new pet - so up Cinnamon Ridge the little boy goes. After which his mother has no choice but to follow.<br />I am not a reader of contemporary romances. This one, though, pulled me in with its characters and proceeded to hold me rapt until I'd finished their story. Jack Pine is not the refuge Chloe thought it would be, as a new danger stalks her even in the supposed safety of the sheriff's office; and Ben Longtree is a complex and fully realized character who, we discover as the tale unfolds, needs Chloe and Jeremy every bit as much as they need him.<br />A fine read, featuring spicy love scenes and realistic handling for all three generations of its characters. And with just a touch of magic, too - courtesy of Ben's Shoshone heritage, which the author not-so-coincidentally shares.ntally shares.	2003-06-01

Carrying on the saga of the starship Voyager's crew following their return to Earth is a heavy load to place on any author's shoulders. For the most part, Christie Golden (whose knack for nailing the characters impressed me in her earlier Voyager books) succeeds in bearing up under that load.<br />She needs a plot that will draw the crew back together, after allowing them to disperse and reconnect with those they left behind seven years earlier. What better way to do that than to pit them against a (possible) conspiracy? And what more tried and true villains are there for a Voyager story than the Borg?<br />This book's greatest strengths are the Borg threat's unique twist, which ties in neatly with established Voyager continuity; and that most of its characters are written with Golden's usual deft accuracy. Its glaring weaknesses are ignoring continuity where Icheb is concerned (apparently the author missed the episode in which he gave up his cortical implant?), and the silliness (I can't find a kinder or more accurate word for it) of Janeway's friendship with Mark Johnson and his wife. It's true that human beings function differently when they are relating to other people on a personal rather than a professional level, but this Janeway simply doesn't ring true on any level. If needing her to be close to a small child over a period of weeks was the reason for plotting the book this way, it would have been better to make Phoebe Janeway a mother and show Kathryn interacting with her own small niece or nephew. That would have supplied a stronger and more credible tie to one of the Borg threat's early victims, as well as sparing us from repeated sugary doses of the Johnsons.<br />Producing Chakotay's mother out of nowhere, just as his sister suddenly popped up toward the end of Season 7, strikes another jarring note. However, the equally out of nowhere Chakotay/Seven of Nine romance (introduced even later in the series) gets masterful handling from Golden. So although \\"Homecoming\\" isn't without its problems, on balance it is a worthy first post-series outing for my favorite Trek crew. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the tale in \\"The Farther Shore,\\" due out a month from now.Homecoming\\" isn't without its problems, on balance it is a worthy first post-series outing for my favorite Trek crew.

If you ever get sorta, well, down on your luck while you are in the islands, get a hold of Ron A&ntilde;ejo. He'll know what to do.&quot;<br />As THE LEGEND OF RON A&Ntilde;EJO opens, Ed Teja's narrator does what just about every American adult has surely dreamed about doing at one time or another. He runs away to Never Never Land. Or at least, that's the sort of life he thinks he'll find in the Caribbean, after he spends a small inheritance to buy and outfit a boat on which he plans to live for the next several years. An old-timer on a wooden boat in the next slip, at the marina from which he departs &quot;the good old US of A,&quot; knows better-and that's undoubtedly why the old-timer offers him that advice.<br />Before he knows it, our friend finds himself stranded on the tiny island of Kayakoo. At the Constant Din Guest House on Toenail Bay, where proprietress Esther Mae serves nothing in her restaurant except coleslaw and fried chicken, he wonders what to do next. Until, to his relief, he finds himself face to face-in that very restaurant-with none other than the legendary Captain Ron! Surely his troubles are over now?<br />They most assuredly are not, because Ron A&ntilde;ejo is this particular Never Never Land's resident Peter Pan. As the book's subsequent chapters unfold, Captain Ron takes his new friend under his wing and leads him (occasionally along with others) on a series of well-meant misadventures.<br />Make that hilarious misadventures. You'll chuckle as you read this book, and from time to time you may even find yourself laughing out loud. In between chuckles, you'll probably realize that Ed Teja's ability to bring the Windward Islands to life comes from knowing that part of the world well-and from knowing boats and the sea, too.<br />A relaxing, enjoyable read, featuring vivid characters and colorfully descriptive writing. Ron A&ntilde;ejo's self-created legend is one you won't want to miss.	2003-05-23

Walter, a drifter who helped Grace in the shelter's kitchen when she was new there, has returned to his home town in far-off Nebraska. Patrick and Grace find his letter worrisome, so they decide to phone and ask if he is all right.<br />Walter is dead. Sometime after he wrote and mailed the letter, his mother found him hanging in a shed on their property - located in a town so small that people drive through it without knowing they've arrived, until the road takes them beyond its limits again. His mother is convinced that Walter didn't kill himself, despite the way she discovered his body. Patrick and Grace agree with her. But why would anyone want to kill such a harmless soul? That's almost harder to imagine than why a man as happy as Walter seemed recently would want to take his own life.<br />The tiny town's other residents, never happy to have outsiders in their midst, swiftly close ranks against Patrick, Grace, and Walter's grieving but determined mother. Who knows a secret that may have everything to do with her son's murder - or does it, after all?<br />I can't speak to this book's merits as a mystery. I seldom read anything in that genre, and therefore have no basis for comparison. But if you're looking for intriguing, sympathetic, and very real characters, you should treat yourself to the most recently released Patrick and Grace tale. Even the supposed \\"bad guys\\" (whose identities I'm not about to reveal) will tug at your heartstrings, because Janet Elaine Smith gives each of her creations believable motivation and a genuinely human face.<br />Now I must try baking \\"Walter's Oatmeal Cookies\\"! Since I've heard from a reliable authority that they are \\"good enough to die for,\\" and the recipe is printed at the end of the book. But I hope they won't cause similar havoc in my somewhat larger town.ope they won't cause similar havoc in my somewhat larger town.	2003-05-12

From her home near Houston, Texas, Sandy Davis answers that cry.<br />This story of an expatriate wife, who follows her husband while his job assignments take him from foreign country to foreign country (as well as all over the United States), could not have been written in an earlier era even though Americans have been living and working overseas for as long as this country has existed. What makes Margie's Japan experience (and therefore, this book) unique is the immediacy of her correspondence with her friend Sandy, who has more than an inkling about what Margie is going through because Sandy's husband is in the same business. In fact, the two women met while both were living in a Western employees' compound in Saudi Arabia, when their husbands had earlier assignments there.<br />Sandy becomes Margie's lifeline, offering an almost daily window into The Real World. Where one can buy food that looks and tastes familiar, and has readable labels. Where the tradespeople with whom a woman must deal treat her as a valued customer, instead of as an intruder whose presence in their country gives constant offense. Where there are books to read and people to talk to, and where the bills she must pay make sense - as do the operating instructions on her household appliances!<br />Being an expatriate wife isn't new to Margie, but living in a land where she feels completely unwelcome and where there are absolutely no other Western residents within reach is something she never imagined before experiencing it. Sandy, the true friend every human being deserves but may not be fortunate enough to find, experiences it right along with her. Gladly and lovingly, responding to Margie's e-mails with messages that make one thing plain to any reader who ever had a close friend: the woman in Texas is drawing just as much emotional sustenance, and is learning just as many lessons from their correspondence, as the one in Japan.<br />You'll learn a lot about the Far East by reading EMails From the Edge. You'll also learn what life is like for U.S. workers abroad on more typical assignments, and for the families who follow them. But what you will remember about this book, and would not find in any more conventional \\"travel story,\\" is the friendship that prompted its e-mails.<br />Highly recommended!eader who ever had a close friend: the woman in Texas is drawing just as much emotional sustenance, and is learning just as many lessons from their correspondence, as the one in Japan.<br />You'll learn a lot about the Far East by reading EMails From the Edge.

Beth Gregory's &quot;gift,&quot; silent since her release from a mental hospital, comes back to life after she accepts the job of live-in assistant to an independently wealthy painter. Having future events take place before her eyes, reflected in mirrors or watery surfaces, is a psychic talent that Beth can neither control nor appreciate. After all, it was this &quot;gift&quot; that caused her physician brother to have her committed in the first place-and one of her two great fears, now, is that Andrew will send her back there.<br />Her other fear is that the visions disrupting her new life (and her first real independence from her family) will come true. Which they do. Repeatedly.<br />I should know better than to begin an Annette Gisby book toward the end of the evening. As usual, I wound up sitting right where I was and reading it straight through. I am not a fan of the thriller genre, but &quot;Drowning Rapunzel&quot; is not a conventional thriller. This author doesn't rely on blood and gore to shock her readers into an appropriately unnerved state. Instead she writes about ordinary people doing ordinary things, lulling us right along with her heroine...until she drops the tale's next bombshell.<br />Like Beth Gregory, we soon find ourselves reaching out-with heightened senses and ever growing dread-to probe the motives and analyze the actions of the story's other characters. We know as well as she does that the killer of long-haired women, whose handiwork she keeps seeing (always before the crime takes place), has her on his list. Also like Beth, we won't know until the last minute who that killer will turn out to be. Her talented but eccentric employer? Her overprotective, temperamental brother?

McMullen writes simply and beautifully about things that are anything else but beautiful. For in the little town of Egesa Springs, isolated by geography and secrets, there's a great deal of evil to hide.<br />Two years ago Tori Slagel, wife of Darren and mother of their two small daughters, survived a beating so brutal that the mob which administered it left her for dead. In a way, perhaps, she did die; because as GONE BEFORE DAWN opens, Tori Slagel no longer exists. It's Cierra Lancing who comes back to Egesa Springs, so changed (she hopes!) by time and surgery that no one there will recognize her. Not even her husband, who is the local elder's son - and who will, therefore, stand by and do nothing to protect their younger child from the fate that Tori/Cierra knows awaits her. Because Kacie Slagel is four years old now...and as far as every adult native to Egesa Springs is concerned, her fate is sealed.<br />Kacie's mother is an outsider, though. And so is journalist Tristen Durant, who (Cierra firmly believes) betrayed her two years earlier. Yet Tristen proves to be Cierra's only possible ally against her husband, his family, and every other inhabitant of Egesa Springs. Every other living inhabitant, that is!<br />GONE BEFORE DAWN is a thriller you won't be able to put down, so don't make the mistake of starting to read it when your time is limited. It has strong elements of horror, but McMullen uses plot twists and surprises to create most of the tale's escalating tension. She doesn't need graphic, gory descriptions to make her readers perceive and fear the depravity that haunts Egesa Springs.<br />No cardboard characters or \\"stock footage\\" scenes in this one.

Is it coincidence that just before Grace's children decide to put &quot;mother&quot; into a rest home, these two finally introduce themselves - and it's an instantaneous CLICK? Or is it just everything going according to plan?<br />I'm not a mystery reader, and that's probably because I'm not fond of formula books. But I have read and enjoyed two of Janet Elaine Smith's historicals, so I ordered IN ST. PATRICK'S CUSTODY fully expecting a good read.<br />I was not a bit disappointed. This &quot;mystery without the cliches&quot; is gently told, and filled with characters whose human foibles make them real. It's also (dare I say this, or will I scare someone away?) a curiously inspirational tale. While the author never preaches, and never allows her characters to do so, either, their faith in the Higher Power watching over their lives comes through loud and clear.<br />Threaded through the book, also, is another theme dear to my heart: that life for the aging Grace Johnsons and Patrick O'Mally's of this world is far from over. Their love story, and (running parallel to it) Grace's discovery that she can make a satisfying life of her own after years of being simply &quot;wife and mother,&quot; are the tale's most memorable elements.	2003-04-14

Opening and closing with a framing story set in 2000, the book's seven intervening chapters span the years from 1099 until then. Each chapter is a self-contained tale that covers a generation or two, telling the lives of the principal families - and the changes that time, technology, and politics bring to their beloved Forest.<br />I'm fascinated, after finishing this book, to go back to its preface and discover that the Austen-like feel of &quot;Albion Park&quot; may be partly due to the author's use of a real-life incident to craft its turning point. That incident, it seems, happened to Jane Austen's aunt! Both &quot;Albion Park&quot; and the chapter following it, &quot;Pride of the Forest,&quot; show Rutherfurd's characters acting within the tight cultural boundaries of their time and place - and yet, like Austen's people, they manage to transcend those boundaries. To show themselves fully, and timelessly - *human.* Even the women!<br />After reading all four of Rutherfurd's novels, I don't hesitate to call this one his best. My one criticism is that I found the end of its framing story something of an anticlimax. However, that's nowhere near sufficient to keep me from giving it the top rating it otherwise richly deserves.	2003-04-10

Telepathy and telekinesis keep Human and Mrdini commerce operating by moving travelers and cargoes instantaneously across vast reaches of space.  Those same Talents enable the two allied species to battle successfully against a third: the implacable Hivers, who covet the same kind of real estate as do Humans and Mrdini.<br />All eight of Damia and Afra's children have Talent ratings of T-1.  All are destined, as adults, to be known as Primes.  Some, like eldest daughter Laria, will operate commercial transfer towers - a prestigious and powerful position, but one that can take a young Prime far away from home.  Some, like sons Thian and Rojer, will carve out new roles for Talents in service aboard naval vessels.  Second daughter Zara's strongly empathic Talent fits her for the career of healer - after it enables her to do what no one else can manage, by communicating (on however rudimentary a level) with a captured Hiver queen.  The Lyon's Pride is, indeed, formidable.  Its four eldest are reaching adulthood just in time to play key roles, as the Human-Mrdini alliance begins to solve the Hiver threat that first loomed when their grandparents were young.<br />An exciting, character-driven tale, which only occasionally bogs itself down with shipboard protocols and politics.  If you can get past those pacing problems, you'll be glad you did; because \\"The Tower and the Hive,\\" the next volume in the Talent series, provides a worthy conclusion to the long-running Gwynn-Raven saga.	2003-03-23

When I was six years old, my family moved from Maine's heavily Protestant coast to one of its just as heavily Roman Catholic mill towns.  What strikes me most powerfully about Carolyn Howard-Johnson's \\"collection of gentle sequels to THIS IS THE PLACE\\" (her novel of life in 1950s Utah) is how curiously familiar it feels to me - a woman whose entire experience with Utah consists of sitting on the runway for an hour in Salt Lake City, waiting for a transcontinental flight to continue, many years ago.  For HARKENING's tales have two common themes running through them, and binding them together:  \\"the child as outsider,\\" and \\"the family as it really exists vs. the family as it imagines itself to be.\\"<br />In \\"Child's Play,\\" a little girl relaxes, chatters freely, forgets to be guarded with her playmate - and soon gives inadvertent offense.  And so the author writes:  \\"His face changed and I knew I had blundered.\\"  That feeling visits the child over and over, throughout the collection's stories told from her viewpoint.  Her religious beliefs differ from those of the highly cohesive majority surrounding her, and she must always remember that she is an outsider.

As the Civil War begins, Reilly Stewart and Owen Woulfe-despite their fathers' close friendship-have yet to meet each other.  The breadth of North America separates them, and Reilly is about to marry someone else.  Even if that wasn't the case, Reilly knows already that Owen is the last man on Earth she could possibly want.  After all, her best friend refused to live with Owen after marrying him!<br />But Meredith Woulfe is dead now, and she's left behind a son.  Owen's son, six-year-old Rory, whom \\"Aunt Reilly\\" loves as her own.  Reilly swears that she and her bridegroom, Union Army Lieutenant Philip Madison, will adopt Rory no matter how much the boy's father - far away in Washington Territory - wants him back, now that his mother is gone.<br />Reilly Stewart's determination matches that of Owen Woulfe.  They're fated to collide like the proverbial irresistible force and immovable object.  They are also both part Shoshone, in a country torn apart by war and poisoned by resurgent racial prejudice.<br />This serious-toned historical romance sweeps its readers across a continent, and through several of the most turbulent years in a still young America's history, as it follows Reilly and Owen's equally turbulent love story.  Inevitably, thanks to their mixed heritage and their pride in it, the two find themselves caught up in one of a divided nation's most shameful atrocities against its native people.<br />You won't forget what happens to them any time soon.	2003-03-22

An ancient book of prophecies, a mystery-shrouded priesthood, and a time of cosmic reckoning bearing down on an unsuspecting populace. Samuel Dalton takes these ingredients, and uses them to weave a tale so original (despite its initially familiar sound) that I don't know when I've enjoyed one this much...Then I started reading, and discovered that this\\"Second Coming\\" doesn't take place in my own star system. I found myself pulled by my shirt-front into a Dalton-created universe, caught up in an age-old conspiracy, and not sure until the final chapter how the archaeologist protagonist could save his (presumably human?) species from extinction.<br />No, 500-plus pages is not too long for this one. \\"Second Coming\\" features strong, yet realistically flawed characters of both genders, completely believable world building on its author's part, and a satisfying yet surprising conclusion. My only criticisms are an occasional pacing problem (rather hard to avoid when writing at this length), and a cast so large that when I had to leave the story and come back to it I sometimes had trouble sorting them all out.<br />BUY THIS BOOK, if you're a hard SF fan who nevertheless demands a character-driven tale. The old masters, writers like Heinlein and Clarke and Anderson, never did it better.	2003-03-22

In this last of McCaffrey's Talent stories, the psychically gifted team of Angharad \\"The Rowan\\" Gwynn and Jeff Raven of Deneb have the dynasty they've founded to draw upon as Humankind takes its long battle against the insect-like Hivers to the home-worlds of that destructive species. For, as Jeff tells one of the Talents' critics in exasperation, the best way to get new Talent is to breed it! Which is why, like every other book in this series, THE TOWER AND THE HIVE is as much about the Gwynn-Raven and Raven-Lyon family as it is about the struggle between the Human-Mrdini alliance and the incomprehensible Hivers.<br />Since I've been following this series from its beginning, I already cared about Damia Gwynn-Raven, Afra Lyon (a \\"methody\\" Capellan who more than holds his own despite his wife's considerably greater mental powers), and their young adult children. The new generation's coming-of-age stories play out while the book's \\"A plot\\" unfolds, and I am pleased that (as in real life) every single loose end does not get tied up - but nothing major is left hanging to frustrate the reader. The resolution of the Hiver threat is handled not at all as I might have expected! Which is a good thing, and the author doesn't rob her \\"villains\\" of their wonderfully creepy alien-ness in the process. The Mrdini, though, become more alien than ever before as we get a look at their culture (and their biology) that is almost too close for comfort.<br />A satisfactory conclusion to an engrossing saga.	2003-03-21

My adult niece gave me Rutherfurd's second book, RUSSKA, as a Christmas gift several years ago. I enjoyed it so much that I went looking for SARUM, and I've since purchased his two more recent books. As I write this review, I have put THE FOREST aside for awhile because Rutherfurd's works can be overwhelming to read one after another.<br />LONDON's twenty-one self-contained tales begin in 54 B.C., and follow several families through often intertwining generations until 1997. We're there when each acquires its surname. We watch as those surnames change; as fortunes are made and lost; as respectability and social status wax and wane, for those who come to call themselves \\"Bull\\" and \\"Ducket,\\" \\"Doggett\\" and \\"Silversleeves,\\" \\"Meredith\\" and \\"Barnikel.\\" Each story carries the unique flavor of the era depicted, and each deals with that time period's defining events.<br />I've heard Rutherfurd compared to James A. Michener, and with that I certainly agree. Both writers concentrate on a particular geographic area, and tell the story of that area's people over a grand sweep of time. However, I do not see Rutherfurd's characters (or Michener's, for that matter) as figures sketched in for the storyteller's convenience. Each major character in the pages of LONDON is created in enough carefully chosen detail to take on individual life. I particularly enjoyed meeting such colorful figures as \\"Dame Barnikel,\\" who founded a dynastic brewery in a time when most married women controlled no property; the Doggett sisters, twin prostitutes with far more respectable descendants; and Helen Meredith, aristocratic ambulance driver during the Blitz.<br />A great deal of background for each tale is presented to the reader in narrative, \\"telling instead of showing\\" format; but Rutherfurd's alternative would have been writing twenty-one novels, because each of his self-contained chapters contains enough material for a complete book. His work feels more condensed than Michener's, and that undoubtedly is why.<br />What these two epic writers have in common is their storytelling's richness. LONDON supplied me with a good, long, thoroughly engrossing read!dly is why.<br />What these two epic writers have in common is their storytelling's richness.

Never mind, now, that it's the last thing in the universe she's ever imagined herself doing.<br />A psychically gifted boy learns to use his increasingly powerful talents more and more effectively, under the guidance of two scientists. One of whom is growing more and more attached to him, and he to her...<br />A habitat programmer's work goes haywire, producing an unexpected something that gives this collection its title.<br />Soul Solution, Boxboy, and Wildflower are my three favorites from Carl Rafala's dark tales of the future. Each story's scenario is distinct, finely drawn, and different from any of the others. While the short story format normally allows little room for character development, the people in these tales come quickly to life as the author builds their personas detail by carefully revealed detail.<br />I don't recommend reading all eleven of these stories in one sitting unless you're a die-hard fan of dark science fiction, because some of them are *very* dark. They are also well enough written to go on haunting you long after you've put the book down.	2003-01-22

She's married to (and still in love with) her high school sweetheart, Billy Ray.  She owns her own business, the Kut-n-Kurl beauty shop.  But while the love hasn't gone out of her marriage, the physical magic certainly has; and the President Trailer Park is not where she wants to spend the rest of her days.  Beth Ann has had enough of living at such close quarters with the likes of crazy Troy Finkmyer-his battered wife, Mary Jo-and nosey old Janet Higgins.  She's also had more than enough of reading about the Park residents' antics in local gossip columnist Shirley Snodgrass's sensationalized weekly offerings.<br />So now Beth Ann is going to get out!  She's got a new computer (bought with church bingo winnings), and she's writing the steamiest, sexist novel she can dream up.  That book's the ticket to elsewhere for Beth Ann and her Billy Ray.<br />Writing it most certainly will change Beth Ann's life.  Not to mention Billy Ray's, and-before all is over-the lives of everyone else in President Trailer Park.  Or should I say the lives of everyone else in Grapevine, Kentucky?<br />This is one of the few books I've read in recent years that has literally made me laugh out loud.  It also made me think that my own 10-year stint as a mobile home park resident was positively boring, compared to the adventures of Beth Ann and Billy Ray.  Yet this comic novel has its serious moments, too; and many of them are quite touching.<br />The authors have done something I love in humorous fiction.  They've taken familiar (even hackneyed) stereotypes, and then deftly fleshed those stereotypes out into genuine, believable individuals.  The result is characters about whom readers can't help caring.  Even while also laughing their heads off!<br />Don't miss this one.  It is priceless.	2003-01-17

When those winds reached the community where he owned and ran an independent pharmacy, W. Everett Beal found himself forced to nap behind his counter each night with a loaded weapon at his side.  That was the only way he could hope to protect his painfully built business from being firebombed or otherwise destroyed.<br />As a lifelong resident of \\"the whitest state in the Union,\\" whose contacts with members of other races have never been like those of native-born Southerners, I found this memoir a fascinating read.  Ever since I've known people of color (which didn't happen until I was a young adult), I've interacted with them as equals.  College classmates, colleagues at professional conventions, next door neighbors, fellow parishioners at my church.  One of my own books lists my very black former pastor in its acknowledgements, for his kindness and helpfulness during more than one life crisis.  So, while Mr. Beal's book is by no means entirely about race relations (past or present), his comments on that theme - the experience of being a Southern man during a turbulent and dangerous era - truly intrigued and enlightened me.<br />However, that's only part of why I can recommend \\"Southern Winds\\" to my fellow readers who enjoy a well-written memoir.  Mr. Beal's years as a columnist shine through his reminiscences of boyhood and young manhood.  He knows how to tell a story, and he's included a very suitable mix of humorous, sad, and thought-provoking anecdotes in this, his first book.  His stated goal is to share with his readers the culture that shaped him, and he has managed to do exactly that.<br />This is a truly a book written from the heart, with touching honesty.  Whether or not you agree with everything Mr. Beal has to say, you will be richer for reading his words and coming to know the characters who have peopled his life.  I certainly am!g his words and coming to know the characters who have peopled his life.  I certainly am!	2002-12-17

Vivacious and beautiful Caroline Kent, daughter of an earl in Regency England, bursts into a \\"gentlemen only\\" area (that is, into a gaming room!) during a social outing.  She takes one look at perfect stranger there, and falls madly in love with him.  Okay, so far we're reading a romance novel set in a very popular era.  One of many such novels...ho hum.<br />Nothing could be further from the truth, though.  The man who has captured Caroline's heart is a Keith of Dunnottar, a Scottish nobleman who's in London on a mission that must come before all else in his life right now.  As James Keith pursues that mission (keeping his true identity concealed, even from Caroline, through much of the book!), he discovers secrets from an earlier era in his own family's history - and some rather more recent ones in Caroline's.<br />\\"Marylebone\\" is going to make you smile, and it's also pretty likely to bring tears to your eyes in some places.  It's a very different book than its prequel, \\"Dunnottar,\\" but it is every bit as well worth reading!	2002-11-23

Before I started to read \\"Dunnottar,\\" a visiting friend who's a museum curator (and graduate degreed historian) happened to pick it up from my dining room table.  She leafed through it and declared, \\"This is a good book!  May I read it when you're through?\\"  Since her tastes and mine often differ, I wondered if that meant I was going to find the tale a dry one.<br />Well, I most certainly did not.  Janet Elaine Smith's novel takes a story from her husband's (Keith) family history, and peoples it with men and women about whom any reader can't help but care.  Being able to guess how John Keith's apparently hopeless love for Ann Hastings would turn out, and knowing enough about the time and place depicted so that I also was sure where the plot must go, didn't keep me from turning the pages eagerly and thoroughly enjoying a well-spun tale.<br />Romance and intrigue, friendship and betrayal, against an accurately researched historical backdrop.  No wonder \\"Dunnottar\\" has been an Amazon bestseller.  I really ought to make my friend the museum curator buy her own copy.	2002-11-17

Along the way Ruth and Torger Silnes learn many things about their country, but Ruth learns just as many about herself.<br />This is a well-told story of a woman's transition from her life's first half to its second, rich in detail and emotion.
