Through the power of demonic worship, this man wowed the masses and used religion to achieve his wretched goals of establishing a single \\"master race.\\" <br /> <br />Erwin Lutzer writes a sobering, must-read, chronicling precisely the way in which one man cunningly and under the power of unseen Satanic forces, took over a nation and nearly conquered the world. What's even more sickening is that the Church was more than an innocent bystander. People of faith willingingly partnered in the death and desctruction of the lives of innocent people.  <br /> <br />Wrapping himself in the cloth of religion, Hitler convinced church leaders to adopt the Nazi platform, even removing sacred symbols and replacing them with the Nazi regalia.  <br /> <br />This book gives further insight into two rarely underdeveloped topics important for believers: 1) the striking parallels between Hitler and the antichrist who will one day rule the world and 2) the well-founded reasons for skepticism on the part of the Jewish people toward evangelicals.  <br /> <br />This book is gripping, sobering, educational book.	2005-08-23

This is a well-written and fast-paced book that takes you inside the battle of Bagdad when the Marines first took the supposedly vaunted city.  <br /> <br />Written from the perspective of a chaplain with the Marines, you'll be moved spiritually and emotionally as you realize the great sacrifice of the young men and woman who have signed up to risk their lives for our country. Furthermore, you'll get surprising details about the role of a chaplain. I always thought they stood on the sidelines and read prayers, but they are in the thick of the theatre with the troops, going on risky missions so they can provide spiritual comfort, balance, and perrspective to men and woman facing the risk of death. A great book to buy for anyone you know who is interested in the war or perhaps for a soldier.	2005-07-24

Having a five-month-old daughter at home, the title immediately grabbed me. True to its cover, this book is a must-read for every father who has daughters.  <br /> <br />Filled with personal insights, biblical exposition, and practical tips, What a Daughter Needs From Her Dad is a wonderful, insightful, call to fathers to raise good, solid, Christian ladies.  <br /> <br />Michael can talk about raising girls, becuase he has six of them! This is a book that I will keep close to me as I watch Grace grow up, hopefully putting into practice the lessons Michael Farris has given in his book. It is my goal to raise a young lady who yearns for God.  <br /> <br />Fathers, please do our country a favor, and buy this book!	2005-06-13

Often it is anger, sometimes it is determination to defy the odds. In this heartwarming tale of love and struggle, both of these emotions are displayed in the lives of Cody Gunner and Ali Daniels. <br /> <br />Acclaimed Christian novelist, Karen Kingsbury shares insights into the world of rodeo, barrel racing and bull-riding, an environemnt that many of us are not familiar with and yet the reader finds himself becoming more interested this distant sport. <br /> <br />Cody is the bitter son of an NFL great. His Dad left at an early age and Cody never forgave him or his mother. Ali is surrounded by loving parents, but she battles a fatal disease, Cystic Fibrosis.  <br /> <br />For Cody, his anger fuels his passion to ride. For Ali, her determination to live a life of purpose fuels her. In the midst of their individual quests, their paths cross and hearts once closed to love are now open. Even as they face Ali's impending death.  <br /> <br />It is clear that Karen wrote this book to be a bestseller and a Hallmark movie. It has all the right elements. And yet the reader's interest is kept because we're taken inside the unknown world of rodeo and the mysterious and yet incurable disease called Cystic Fibrosis.  <br /> <br />I came away with a greater appreciation for both, especiall those who struggle with CF. I had heard of the disease, but I did not really know what it was. Karen Kingsbury carefully educates the reader on the struggles, the medical treatments, the long-term prognosis, and everday life for those afflicted with this disease. If anything the beautiful storytelling and the delicated dialogue draw into the world of CF like never before. I personally came away with much greater compassion for the parents of CF-afflicted children. God bless them.  <br /> <br />This is an inspirational book, a family-time story, a heartwarming tale of hope, love, and forgiveness. You're entire family will enjoy it.	2005-05-10

Even the bad guys have good in them. That's the case with the Broker.  <br /> <br />A highly charged political plot hatched by the powerful invalid who runs the CIA snatches corporate criminal and former powerful lobbyist, Joel Backman from the depths of prison life into the unique culture of Italy. Always on the run and yet nowhere to go, Backman is forced to become one with those around him in the slow-paced everday life of Milan. Until he makes his break and undoes all the wrong he manifested on the world during his heyday.  <br /> <br />Grisham delivers a mildly thrilling, but especially captivating novel full of suspense, rich, layered characters, and introspection into Italian culture. Its a fine read, a wonderful book, and another chapter in the evolving work of John Grisham.	2005-04-22

I felt that people had waited long enough for Glorious Appearing. I have actually talked to more and more people who liked the Left-Behind series but have felt that it should go quietly into the night.  <br /> <br />So I was surprised at the aim and direction of Rising. Jenkins could have rolled out the same script and characters as Left Behind, inserted some forward-looking prophecies by Tim Lahaye, threw a few dozen Bible verses in and called it a day. Instead what comes forth is a reasoned, deep, character-driven, rich novel of intrigue and suspense.  <br /> <br />Jenkins takes us through the rather sordid events that surround the conception of the one who will be the antichrist, tapping into a well of mainstream evangelical theories as to the origins of his birth. A dowdy teacher's aid is chosen by the Satan-worshipping organization that is setting itself up to rule the world. At the same time, we're taken through the very average life of one Rayford Steele, who will emerge, post-Rapture, as a hero and nemesis of Carpathia.  <br /> <br />I was mildly disturbed and surprised by the detailed events of both Carpathia's conception and the juvenile college relationships of Rayford Steele. For that reason alone, I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 16-17 and even in that, I would hesitate. The book is clean, but some of the subjects discussed are appropriate for adults.  <br /> <br />I was also delighted to see that Rising shares the clear Gospel message and takes a poke at the modern evangelical church who inspires and warms the heart but never seeks the salvation of the soul. To me it reveals the deeping longing in the heart of the writer to see more people added to God's Kingdom. <br /> <br/>On the whole, Rising is a great prelude to the Left-Behind series, a wonderful read, but not a necessary companion to the twelve brilliant end-times volumes.	2005-03-07

Obsessed is a cross genre psychological thriller, taking the reader on a journey between two worlds-1970's California and the Holocaust in 1940's Poland.  <br /> <br />Stephen Friedman is a young, rich successful Jew trying to forget his heritage. Roth Braun is an evil butcher obsessed with power and death-a trait passed down by his equally hideous father, a guard at one of Poland's Nazi labor camps. <br /> <br />Stephen and Roth are on a collision course to find the \\"Stones of David\\" and end up crossing paths. Stephen to find his \\"life love\\" Esther and Roth to finally end the lives of the three Jews his father failed to put to death.  <br /> <br />As a Messianic Jew, it was a deeply personal and emotional look at the unbelievable torture my ancestors endured. There were a couple times I was forced to close the book and take it all in. In a different time and place-that could have been me, marched off to the gas chamber.  <br /> <br />The story, of obsession and longing, works well even if its execution is slightly flawed. Stephens rapid journey from carefree rich guy to crazed heir is too rapid to be believable. Roth Braun is almost too wicked to be real. The truest people seem to be the ones with the smallest roles, such as Ruth, Martha, and Esther.   <br /> <br />But no novel is perfect, is it? While Obsessed is flawed on several fronts, it is a fantastic read, a physiological thriller and an emotional ride I heartedly recommend.  <br />	2005-02-28

Safely Home not only stimulates all the necessary senses to be a riveting work of fiction, but more importantly it will educate and inform the Christian about their spiritual kin across the ocean.  <br /> <br />There are two Chinas. The one they want you to see and the one that they don't want you to see. Through the interwoven lives of two men, Ben Fielding and Li Quan, he takes you on a journey through the lives of Christian brothers who suffer hardship and persecution at the hands of the aging Socialist state.  <br /> <br />Doing what few journalists have done, Alcorn highlights the moral failure of American businesses who give blind allegiance to the governments repressive regimes. Many who work in the factories are political prisoners. Some are believers who meet in in illegal house churches.  <br /> <br />And yet the Chinese believers do not complain. Li Quan actually prayed for persecution, becuase it keeps the church pure. And he highlighted American Christians preoccupation with creature comforts instead of sharing God's love.  <br /> <br />At the end of the day, I still believe in free trade with China, but only becauze I believe that God can use businesses and events like the Olympics to open the doors and change hearts in this communist country. However, believers should be wary of marketing China as free and modern. There are still many violations of human rights which are accepted as standard practice.  <br /> <br />We as belivers need to pray for China. And read this book. It is a sobering education of China. I will now add those silent, suffering brothers and sisters to the top of my prayer list.	2004-10-28

Bush	Books	5	18	26	N	N	A Thorough Look at the Bush White House	Ronald Kessler has distinguished himself as a first-rate independent journalist who has peered inside several presidential administrations. In A Matter of Character, he does the same, relying on hundreds if not thousands of interviews with not only principals like Rice and RUmsfeld and Cheny, but also lower-level staffers and seemingly non-essentials like Secret Service staff, ushers, cooks, and others. What he finds is a man completely at peace with himself, a man not hell-bent on power, and not affected by the onslaught of criticism from left-wing media and Democratic foes.  <br /> <br />Kessler takes a unique approach, contrasting Bush's treatment of people with other presidents. What you'll find is that he has a unique political management style, bringing a business-like atmosphere to a place where turf battles, infighting, and power graps are usually the norm. Bush has none of that. Its all about getting things done, loyalty to the cause, and personal sacrifice to the country.  <br /> <br />A special bonus is Kessler's focus on Bush's education policy, which gets short-shrift by the media. He shares how Bush has consulted many experts across the fields and has formulated his ideas for how our children should learn. He has a conservative philosophy, yet he doesn't fall into the knee-jerk traps most of his ideological soulmates often fall into. His policies illustrate a man concerned with helping all children read and succeed.  <br /> <br />This is a good book, a fun read, and a keen insight into a great man, George W. Bush.	2004-09-10

Beth Moore's deep study of the life of John isn't that way. Moore plunges into the heart of John' character, offering personal insights and practical tips on applying the lessons learned from this beloved disiciple.  <br /> <br />This is the first Beth Moore book I have read and I was very happy with it. Many spiritual books are hard to read and take a great deal of discipline. Moore's frequent asides will make this spiritual book a more fascianting read.  <br /> <br />She is also quick to point out where she is offering an opinion on a part of John's life that is not made clear by the text. She has done her homework in preparing for this book, having sought hte best resources to help fill in the blanks.  <br /> <br />The strongest parts of The Beloved Disciple are Beth's observations on John's relationship with Jesus and with the other disciples. I was especially intrigued by her analysis of John's long life and how it may have caused him to wonder why God did not set him aside for martyrdom. Also, her research on Patmos made me realize he didn't just sit at a nice desk and write away. The exile was more like a labor camp.  <br /> <br />The weakest point of the book is her coverage of Revelation. She admits to looking at the book only in terms of how it affects John's life. I would have liked to see her take on the events to take place in the end times.  <br /> <br />By and large, however, this is a good book that brings fresh pracitcal and historical insights into the character of the Apostle whom Jesus loved.	2004-08-30

The world is in danger of extinction. One woman has the power to find the cure. And Thomas Hunter, the one man who can see the future, is sleeping.  <br /> <br />Ted Dekker has created a real-life new action hero, Thomas Hunter, who splits his time between two worlds. Red is the brilliant sequel to the fast-paced fantasy fiction thriller, Black. In this one, Dekker doesn't let up on the throttle, but instead revs up the engine, taking the reader through series of international crises in both the real-world of international terrorism and the alternate world where Elyon rules. And yet for Thomas, he is real in both dimensions. His scrapes and bruises in one world transfer to the other. And his wife in the one world is the woman he loves in the next.  <br /> <br />What makes Red such a compelling read is its lucid and tight writing. Often sequels can be a little of a letdown, dragging the reader along a boring trail, just to finish the story. However, Red doesn't do that.  <br /> <br />Red is a fantastic book, a piercing fantasy thriller that does more than entertain. It's creative pulse provide a realistic metaphor for the spiritual life. <br />	2004-08-23

These are the two pounding issues that Karen Kingsbury weaves into her tale of hope, love, and forgiveness. Never one to stand on the bully pulpit, Kingsbury allows her characters to speak for her and with great care explores boths sides of very difficult issues.  <br /> <br />Depression is something that Christians have often dealt with too simply and yet Kingsbury in hilighting this problem refuses to allow psychology and psychiatry rule the day, always allowing her characters to come to realize that a vibrant relationship and dependence on Christ is the only cure for a life plagued by anxiety and doubt.  <br /> <br />Maggie Stoval wore a mask. She tried to \\"appear\\" spiritual while allowing past sin and guilt to form a weight around her soul. Only when she finally confessed her sin, accepted God's forgiveness, did she move on to an authentic life of forgivenss and grace in God. Too often believers allow their pride and their myths that God won't forgive to keep them from experiencing God's best for their lives.  <br /> <br />I also appreciated life from Ben's perspective. He grew up like many of us in a Christian environment with certain expectations of people and he discovered through his own hardship, the hard lessons of grace.  <br /> <br />Kingsbury weaves a tale of suspense that takes us through the lives of real Christians facing real problems and trials. She presents, through flawed characters, the image of a God who hears the cries of His people and responds in miraculous ways.  <br /> <br />This is another star in Kingsbury's excellent collection of well-timed Christian novels. Read it and enjoy.	2004-08-19

Tolkien, a new breed of Christian authors is venturing into the world of fantasy, attempting to open the reader's mind and draw parallels to the life of faith. Michael Warden, writer, adventurist and pastor is one of those daring souls. And he delivers a powerful punch in his thriller, Gideon's Dawn.<br />Gideon is a confused and conflicted college professor who battles fierce rages when all of a sudden a routine earthquake-watching expedition launches him into another world in which he is a complete stranger but whose characters quickly brand him as a Kinsman Redeemer. It's a title he quickly rejects and a world that he struggles to understand. <br />Gideon's Dawn reveals the treasure that results when a person of faith fully explores the depth of human imagination. It draws not-so-obvious parallels to the Christian experience and yet leaves the reader spell-bound, searching for clues to the meaning of this strange new life of Gideon.<br />Wardens' characters are rich, his plots complex, and the story flowing in style and substance. This book is no cookie-cutter page-turner, but a deep and intriguing novel that will exhaust all of your senses. <br />He leaves Gideon as a character with a rough past and a flawed life. He is someone with whom we can identify-imagine being lifted from normalcy into a strange world where Words have power and where thoughts are not kept silent but can be read by your peers? And yet it is in this life that Gideon finds his purpose and calling. <br />If you enjoy a good story with many twists and unpredictability, then Gideon's Dawn is for you.	2004-07-13

What would happen if the swing voice on the United States Supreme Court, the darling of the elite eastern media and the hero of center-left Democratic party, undergoes a change of heart and becomes a dyed-in-the-wool conservative? And what if her conversion occurs just as she is appointed chief justice? <br />In a thoroughly Christian thriller, James Scott Bell delivers a heart-pounding suspense that paints all sides of the political canvass. Bell is clearly conservative politically and yet he doesn't offer weak, straw-man arguments for the other side. Neither does he create stick-figure belivers who can only offer easy cliques. He gives a heroine who makes the slow journey towards God and a pastor whose only checkered past gives him a heart for souls in need and a compassion for the hurts of those around him.<br />James Bell weaves the everday life of common Americans with the inside-the-beltway intrigue that makes Washington, D.C, the most suspicious place in the world. <br />Deadlock is a solid Christian novel that asks the right questions, keeps the heart pumping, and weaves a sure, but subtle Christian theme throughout.	2004-06-28

But, author and speaker, Tim Burns has written a well-crafted and Biblical alternative that suggests God may take his most-loved servants and put them through the crucible of hardship. <br />Forged in the Fire is a comprehensive study of the life of God's great leaders. Why did God bring David to the peaks of victory over Israel's sworn enemy only to plunge him into a web of deceit and betrayal? <br />Why did God allow Joseph to be nearly killed by his brothers, sold into a foreign empire, and accused of rape? This is not the life that most Christians would eagerly sign up for, but Burns argues that this is the way God prepares his leaders. He thrusts them into the fire, shaping their character, and making them battle-ready. <br />Forged in the Fire is a wonderfully interactive resource with a daily Scripture guide. It can be used for personal devotional study and journaling, as a teaching guide for small groups, or as a curriculum for advanced Bible classes. <br />Forged in the Fire mixes the practical and the spiritual, bringing the compelling stories of ancient Bible characters to life. Part teaching tool, part workbook, part personal journey, this book will be an excellent resource in helping to build your faith in God.	2004-06-03

It is a refreshing read by someone who at long last has not been changed by Washington, but by sheer force of her will and good Christian spirit may have done a little to change Washington. <br />This book is not a dry political memoir, nor is it a kiss and tell biography, nor is it a payback opportunity, nor is it a slap-myself-on-the-back memoir. Instead, its a thoughtful, honest chronicle of a hard-working woman's ascent to the top of the political spectrum and how she never abandoned what was important to her. <br />You will find a new and fresh look at President Bush and the way he thinks, operates, and the personal causes that beat at his heart. Even if you're on the opposite side of the political divide, you'll enjoy the behind-the-scenes look at the men and women who give their lives, often unappreciated and misunderstood, to serve their country. Many of them are devoting their time and energy out of a sense of duty to the land they love. <br />What you will find in this book that few other White House tales will share is the common, everday occurences in a political campaign. Such as the logistics of travel as well as personal things, like arranging for a son's schooling or the impact of moving your family. This was really neat. <br />Most of all, the Bush team presented by Karen Hughes comes across as loving, compassionate, and genuinely interested in the welfare of the American people. Not the partisan, emotionless, attack dogs they have been characterized as by the media. <br />This book was a pleasure to read and I encourage anyone interested in a mom's perspective of a campaign to read Ten Minutes From Normal. Its amazing how far we've come, that a busy housewife can become the President's most trusted and frank adviser.	2004-05-10

For the second time, I have come away with a respect for the quality of writing that Karen Kingsbury produces. <br />Her characters are not storybook, because their lives are flawed as are all of us and yet she accurately chronicles the work of God upon the hearts of his children and their response to the Holy Spirit's prodding.<br />A Moment of Weakness is not for the faint of heart--I wouldn't recommend it for children because of the complicated plot lines. However, for those who did pick up this book, it will give you a fresh perspective of God's incredible grace and love in bringing his children back from the slough of thier own sins and into a loving embrace. <br />You will not be able to put this book down as you find yourself heavily steeped into the lives of the characters of this great tale. <br />Buy this book--its definitely a one or two-nighter.	2004-04-26

They don't come across as having solved everything. They still get mad at each other on occasion. That's refreshing. <br />Some of us who are a bit more conservative may find offense at some references to dancing and movies, but those are minimal and really do not detract from the whole of the book. <br />I would really suggest this for your first year of marriage.	2004-04-22

You can't read one of his books overnight and get the full benefit. Tozer on the Holy Spirit chooses the best of Tozer and gives you a digestible portion every day.	2004-04-22

So, I picked up the book for myself and soon found out why it was so popular among pastors and lay leaders. <br />Weirsbe delivers a warm, easy-to-read primer on following God. The Christian life is really about sacrifice and service. Why are we here? For ourselves or to glorify our God? <br />Whether you're a pastor or a plumber, a songleader or a salesman, this is a great book to read if you're heart's desire is to be a servant of God.	2004-04-22

And this book reveals the small-town, mountain charm with which he has governed and represented the state of Georgia. Very few politicians can enter Wasthington and not come away different, but Zell Miller has stayed true to his core principles. <br />This book is not just a crass political screed, but a well-thought out and reasonsed explanation of Zell's life and governing style. I enjoyed the many references to his life in the hills of Young Harris Georgia. He takes the reader back to his life and his time. <br />Miller is truly a rare politican, who only wants to serve people and bring common-sense solutions to government. If only this man would run for President someday! I would vote for him in a heartbeat. <br />I applaud Senator Miller's courage in bucking his own party to support a man whose policies he agress with. I wish all Democrats were like this, providing the nation with much-needed discourse on the real issues.	2004-04-21

He has again managed to share a story of common people, of the human condition, of less-than-perfect characters and for that his story moves and flows. But, it lacks the rythmic suspense of some of his other bestsellers. There are no offshore accounts in the Caymans, no greedy businessmen or shady lawyers. In a sense, everyone in this small town life is flawed, but noble in a way. <br />I enjoyed The Last Juror for humor and storytelling, but I was put off by Grisham's unusual amount of language and sexuality. We all know he can tell a good story without having to reach down to the levels he did in The Last Juror. <br />All that being said, I would say that The Last Juror is worth reading, but it is definitely not the heart-pounding thriller you've come to expect. It is definetly not as good as the majority of his other books.	2004-04-08

It peers deeply into the mind of Rumsfeld, logging his wit, his manly charm, and his unconventional style of management. <br />There are very few revealing facts in Decter's work. Instead, she marvels at the popularity and rise of a humble Chicagoan, whose ambition and drive have carried him to the highest reaches of government. She charts his transformation of failing businesses into profitable enterprises and his ongoing dream of remaking and reshaping the modern American military. <br />For those who admire Rumsfeld, this will offer no additional facts, but will simply serve as a personal portrait into one of America's most capable leaders. <br />We should all be grateful he is at the top of our nation's defenses.	2004-03-30

Only Ted Dekker could merge the worlds of terrorism, government power, and the netherworld and do it in a gripping way. <br />Dekker has created a novel far outside the box of traditional Christian literature and yet still delivers a fantastic and suspenseful thrill ride. His stark worlds between darkness and light evoke images of ancient classics like the Chronicles of Narnia and Lord of the Rings. <br />And yet, Dekker has provided a thoroughly realistic and modern hero in Thomas Hunter, an everyday guy just as mystified by what is happening to him as the reader is. I am typically skeptical of anything resembling science fiction or fantasy-It usually does not pique my interest and yet Dekker had me gripping the pages of my hardcover and wanting more. <br />The incursion into the \\"other world\\" is deep enough just to get a glimpse, but not too far to bore you with tales of fantasy and lore. And the Scriptural metaphors aren't too easy to grasp, but peek through, engaging fully the reader's mind. <br />You'll learn to love Hunter, hate the evil men who wish to bring destruction upon the earth, but more importantly, you'll experience a close encounter with the spiritual battle between good and evil. <br />By going outside the usual bounds of fiction, Dekker has created a stimulating masterpiece. I can't wait for the next two books in the trilogy.	2004-02-17

In Bill Budd, Herman Melville makes reference to the skullduggery of impressments in his 1845 short story. <br />The impressments controversy of the early 1800s grew from the British Navy's long-standing practice of augmenting its crews with sailors forcibly taken from coastal towns and merchant ships. After the American Revolution, the British no longer sent &quot;press gangs&quot; onto American soil in search of crews, but they continued to stop American merchantmen at sea, insisting on their right to search for deserters from the British Navy. <br />In Will I Am, novelist Christensen, director of a small Danish company working in the field of Renewable Energy, presents the plight of three American seamen -- William Watson, John Brown, and Amos Stevens -- impressed into service by the British Royal Navy, and details their ripped apart lives in consequence. One of the most tragic truths is that these three were the sons of American revolutionaries, many of whom died on the battlefields for freedom. Ironic was that England lost the war in the colonies, but continued to be masters of the sea. The only justice was the shipwrecking of many of these man-o-wars, which were dangerously misguided on an arrogant course, by American slaves of the sea. Sadly, many of the perished lives were young men and women who were forced to serve against their will. <br />Christensen provides plenty of facts in this haunting tale of history. His breadth of reserch is noteworthy, but his fictional narrative could have been much improved. His pacing is slow and becomes barnacled by too many dry-dock facts. Only the serious student of history might have the necessary discipline to stay the course. The story, however, provides readers with insight into the courage and heroism as well as tragic stories of wasted human lives, false dreams of freedom, and a fledgling America's struggle to wrest itself from Britain's grasp.	2004-01-20

There are no corporate fat cats, no pragmatic laywer heroes, no high-stakes, big money, accounts-in-the-Caymans courtroom dramas. And yet, what remains of Grisham is the heart and soul of all of his literature, what makes him an endearing staple for his fans: rich character development. <br />Eddie Rake is a well-developed, southern, take-no-prisoners football coach who has left a mark on a tiny town. The other characters are rich and full, with regrets, imbedded memories, and a sense of belonging to a tight football fraternity.<br />Bleachers is a welcome read, a delightful piece of literature, especially for those who have at one time played competitive team sports. The dialogue between formerly ego-centric, hard-hitting alpha males brought back my own memories of playing on our high-school basketball team. <br />I also thought this book was very similar to another wonderful tale by another best-selling author, Jerry Jenkins. Hometown Legend has similar plotlines, developed around the unique passion of southern high-school football. <br />I applaud Grisham for reaching beyond his legal niche and producing a delightful read. Go get this book and put it on your nightstand today.	2004-01-20

The Last Jihad was so heart-pounding and sensational, I couldn't wait to pick up The Last Days. I had a little fear that the story wouldn't or couldn't live up to the first one, but I was not disappointed by Rosenberg's latest effort. <br />Clearly, this man is a qualified expert when it comes to assessing the geopolitical nature of the Middle East. He also is a classic Washington insider and a expert on military affairs. That being said, this book is tight and concise and avoids boring the reader with technical or policy minutiae. It is a heart-pounding thriller of the first rate.<br />One of the problems readers often have with fiction is that at times the scenarios are unrealistic. But, what critics of Rosenberg and others must understand is that this is fiction, a work of art. Moreover, I would argue that the Last Days is not terribly out of this world. He properly describes the Middle East as the powder keg it is and he drops the matches that ignite this historic region into near world war. <br />There is a drawback to the Last Days in that it can't really decide which era it wishes to be in--2003 or 2010. Seven years from now, pop culture, technology, and politics will look much different and it seems that Rosenberg likes to launch into this unknown future, but leave the 2003 time warp. I also thougth the book was weak on guaging public and press opinion. It seemed as though the notoriously liberal American media and notoriously fickle American public gave President MacPherson a blank check to reshape the world. But, those are minor quibbles that any reader will find with any piece of great fiction. <br />One of my favorite aspects of this book is Rosenberg's subtle Christian message, that approaches Jesus first from the logical viewpoint of a Israeli security chief (check the sources!), and then from the emotional need. Rosenberg doesn't preach a sermon, it is displayed in the everyday lives of its Christian characters. <br />The Last Days, like the Last Jihad, is a heart-pounding thrill ride into a very possible future scenario. Rosenberg's plots not only will make this book a must-have, it will set the gears of your mind thinking of &quot;what-ifs&quot; and &quot;who knows?&quot;. <br />Clearly, this talented journalist and storyteller will educated and inform you about the complicated world in which we live. Make this one of your brand-new reads this year.	2004-01-02

I was a bit skeptical because of the 9/11 tie-in. I thought it would be another round of smaltz and commercialism profiting on a tragedy. <br />I couldn't have been more wrong. One Tuesday Morning really moved me emotionally and spiritually. This plotline was not only realistic, it brought me cascading back to that fateful day more than two years ago. <br />This story delicately and carefully weaves the interesection of tragedy and faith and walks the reader closely through the inner struggles of God's children and the journey of those the Holy Spirit is anxiously trying to woo. <br />And it should motivate men to be more like Jake and abandon their tendencies to be like Eric. And what better way for God to show Eric his sin than for him to walk in another man's shoes? <br />One Tuesday Morning handles the tragedy of 9/11 with grace and courage and delivers a moving portrait of a story that could have been and a plot line that really is. <br />You'll be challenged spiritually and emotionally by this poignant look at a national tragedy.	2003-12-10

It echoes much of the style of Dee Hendersen's Uncommon Heroes Series. It is interesting to step into a world so foreign to many people. <br />Mel also knows how to write a fairly believable plot line. And his character development is rich and vibrant. Apocalypse Dawn is like a microscopic close-up of one angle of the end times, unlike Left-Behind, which is a blow-by-blow chronilogical account. <br />Where this book fails considerably are on two fronts. First, it is quite long and protracted and the average reader will quickly tire of the endless military jargon. It's great for war geeks, who love to rap about RPGS and M-7's and a billion other acronyms and abreviations. The cliques and phrases that are a part of military culture come off as preachy to the average person. <br />The biggest beef, however, will be with Mel's strange theology. The way to salvation is mixed and jumbled. Good Christians are left behind because they got mad at God for taking away relatives prematurely. Since when did standard soul-searching become the Unpardonable Sin? By this criteria, Mel would throw Job and David and Paul out of Heaven. And then in another point, it seems as though Baptism is the way to Heaven. I was really troubled by Mel's strange Gospel message. It seems as though he needs to put down the military manuals and brush up on basic Scriptural theology. <br />All in all, Apocalypse Dawn is a thrilling read, full of interesting military information and richly layered characters, but don't base your faith on it. Because it leaves you wondering who what it takes to get left behind.	2003-12-10

That is why I eagerly anticipated reading this book. <br />And I couldn't have been more disappointed. In fact, I'm scratching my head wondering 1) How a major publisher allowed this to press without significant edits. 2) How Tim LaHaye can put his prestige and now worldwide name recognition on a book so terribly flawed. <br />The idea behind Babylon Rising is brilliant, but the writing is so below grade, I can't believe it will get a single positive review. The characters are so unbelievable, the plot line is convaluted and bizzare, and the dialoge is terribly amateur. I can guarantee that if this were produced by an unknown writer and submitted to any publishing house, it would be flatly rejected. <br />I am terribly disapointed, because I really like the idea of a series based on Daniel's prophecies. The anticipation and the hype was such that I was running out to get this book. And by the lofty standards created by Left-Behind, I could have sworn that this book would be awesome. <br />It is clear that Tim LaHaye, without master craftsmen Jerry Jenkins, fails as a fiction writer. Its too bad.	2003-12-10

The Last Jihad was a surprising, thrill-ride through a realistic scenario that could happen. Current events, including the recent war in Iraq have made this book all too real and somewhat chilling. Clearly Joel Rosenberg is a legitimate insider with a breadth and depth of foreign policy that matches few others. <br />Like most readers, I had only known Rosenberg through his regular reporting for World Magazine. But, as this novel demonstrates, Rosenberg not only is in the know, (experience with Limbaugh, Forbes, and other political heavyweights), but can also craft a rich, textured novel that leaves the reader rushing to turn the page. <br />The sparkle of the action and the tightness of the writing reveals a talent beyond that of a first-time writer, which Rosenberg is. The Last Jihad has Clancy-esque quality, minus the extra 200 pages, and yet still contains the richness and vibrancy that bonds the characters with the reader. <br />What's even more impressive is the reality of what plays out in The Last Jihad. You never scratch your head and say, &quot;That couldn't happen.&quot; Instead, you wonder and worry and wish it doesn't come to pass!! Obviously with the Butcher of Baghdad no longer in power, that is not possible. <br />The Last Jihad is a superb novel in ever sense of the word, from the rich, layered writing to the impressive, but not boring details, to the political machinations that only an insider could chronicle, to the heart-pounding, real-world drama that unfolds. What's more, Rosenberg iserts the presence of Christian faith, but doesn't sermonize. <br />You'll want to pick up this book and read it. It will be a wonderfully dangerous thrill ride.	2003-12-10

This book, however is written with a free and easy style that draws the reader further into the core of the subject. <br />You'll be inspired by the fresh anedotes and stories that permeate Life Wide Open and you'll be challenged by the Scriptural application that can and should motivate you to greater service for the King.<br />We all should live for God not because we have to or because we want rewards or because its better than the alternative. Those are all valid reasons, but the core of our faith should a unrequitting love for the Savior, who loved us enough to die for us on the cross. <br />I would urge you to take some time and read this book.

I have always known Liz Curtis Higgs as a humorist-having heard her on Christian radio a number of times. I had never read anything by her until now and what a fantastic read it was!<br />Thorn in My Heart absolutely grabbed me and wouldn't let go. This story is so rich and layered with meaning. I understand why it took Liz so wrong to transfer this plot from her heart to ours. Her thorough research of the Old TEstament story as well as 18th Century Scotland makes this book real and believable. And not only is the historical setting accurate-it carries the reader into 18th century Scotland and the hearts and minds of these proud, but God-fearing people.<br />You will laugh and cry at the characters on this stage. Liz brings out their real attributes every so slowly, not quick to make harsh judgments, but letting time and circumstance reveal them instead. <br />And if you know the Biblical account, Thorn In My Heart provides more depth to the people you thought you knew. Deceit, when displayed in full color, casts a far blacker shadow. And yet, you're often examining your own heart and asking, &quot;What Would I Have Done?&quot; And the pithy quotes at the beginning of each chapter leave the mind wondering what is to come next. <br />Thorn In My Heart doesn't shout the message-it allows for their subtle display in the good and bad choices of its human characters. There are no cookie-cutter heroes or villains, only sinners in need of God's redemptive grace. <br />I salute Liz Curtis Higgs for writing an elegant literary classic that will be talked about for years. Add this book to the stack on your nightstand and you will not be disappointed.	2003-10-21

Do we embrace her Christianity or dismiss her vulgararity? <br />Travelling mercies is filled with her customary wit, humility, and frenetic disorganization that quite honestly characterizes most Christians were they honest as Ann is. Her willingness to admit her failings and weaknesses is something to admire and applaud. Her transparency is recommended in every believer. <br />What I find troubling with Ann is that she seems to revel in all of her problems. She is proud of her vulgarity and her affinity for things she knows disappoint the God she loves. I'm a firm believer in grace, but should we willingly abuse the test God's mercies? He wants us to come as we are, but not stay that way. That's why he's given us His Word to point to a better way. That's not to say any of us have arrived, because we haven't. We're all feet of clay.<br />Believers, especially new ones, might get the false impression that sin is okay and that it's okay to stay spiritually immature. They might also get the impression that anyone who earnestly tries to honor His God is altogether pious, legalistic, arrogant, and boastful. Many Christians are, but far more are not and would people like Ann open an honest dialogue, they would discover fallen people like themselves on a journey toward Christ-likeness.<br />Travelling Mercies is intelligent, well-written, and refreshingly to the point. I can't however, in good conscience, give it a complete thumbs up, because of some of its content. But, I do pray that God blesses the irreverant Ann Lamott.	2003-09-05

The King of Torts departs from his usual, small-guy-takes-on-the-system-and-flees-the-country story. <br />In this, he sheds light on the dark side of the legal profession, with money-grubbing lawyers combing the marketplace for mass tort legislation. And they don't do it out of a sense of justice, they do it because the money is there. <br />I had always had this beef with the tobacco legislation. Nobody wants kids to smoke, but the real truth is that in the end, the money goes to the lawyers. The same is with the attacks on the pharmaceutical companies and so forth. Watch, out Big Food!!<br />Anyway, Grisham doesn't let lawyers or big companies off the hook and he further educates the common man on the inner workings of the legal system. I have learned more about the law reading Grisham than anything else. <br />This is a great book and it doesn't have the usual ending or twist that he likes to include in his legal plots. It's original, witty, humorous, and drives home a poignant message. <br />You'll enjoy this at the top of your stack of books, resting on your nightstand.	2003-09-04

I followed their plight and even put their picture on my computer desktop at work to remind me to pray for them. <br />However, this book was absolutely refreshing--first to hear the real story behind the account. (It's amazing how poor our news media is at getting the story right!). Secondly, Gracia writes in a moving, human way that inspires all Christians to love and serve God with all their heart. <br />Gracia is a human being who echoes what all of us would feel were we put in the same position. Furthermore, she doesn't edit out her frustrations and doubts--her internal wrestling matches with God. I'm glad for that. <br />Unlike most books of its type, the editing on the book is superb. Dean Merril manages to tell a compelling story in Gracia's voice. You'll enjoy her sense of humor in difficult times. There are moments where I was tickled to death and moments I was in tears. <br />Gracia also pays a loving tribute to her husband, Martin throughout the book. She really doesn't take any credit for herself, pointing only to God and to her husband. And after reading it, I think all Christian men will aspire to live like Martin--selfless, caring, and devoted to Christ and family. <br />I would strongly suggest picking up this book, especially if you've grown depressed, doubtful, or weary of your calling. You can't help but be thankful for what God has given you and you can't help but grow more committed to His calling.	2003-08-19

However, for the first time, it puts on paper a speculation much of the country has held about the Kennedys. Perhaps they are cursed. Most importantly, it opens up a new Kennedy debate: Are their attempts to serve their country thwarted by a mysterious brush with death or is it their reckless behavior that leads them to destruction? <br />Edward Klein does a good job of bringing to the fore the argument without taking sides. Only those reviewers who didn't read the book will say he espouses the curse theory. In reality, he seems to debunk that by saying their \\"above-the-law\\" recklessness runs into unbreakable laws of nature. <br />What is most interesting and most education about The Kennedy Curse is Klein's foray into the Kennedy past-beyond the life of Papa Joe and into the Ireland of Patrick Kennedy. <br />For me, this book accomplishes something. It adds yet another argument agains the airbrushed venear of Camelot and helps to reveal further the excesses to which these people lived. No longer can the public hide behind JFK's boyish looks and youthful appeal. He was a man of great and terrible vice and a puppet of powerful family interests. What irks me is how these people felt they deserved a better life and deserved the opportunity to govern. That is why I believe their attempts at political legacy have never gotten off the ground. They are victims of their own arrogance and pride--traits that lead to destruction. <br />One cannot read this book and hold anything but contempt for a family that has abused their positoin in America. Why is the sloppy, womanizing, drunk Ted Kennedy still a \\"distinguished Senator? Do the people of Boston not read of his exploits? <br />Once again, after a reading of a Kennedy chronicle, you'll grow more disgusted at a family that has done less with more. Call it a curse.

It must have taken a great deal of work on the part of the team at In Touch Ministries.<br />This book is carefuly divided into sections that reach almost all areas of the Christian life, from salvation to tongues to the Lord's Supper. In each section, Stanley shows his extensive knowledge of Scripture and his ability to teach the Word in a simple manner. He also sprinkles in many quotes and Scripture references for additional study. I'm a writer and I often use this book just to look up quotes on a particular subject not often found in traditional quote books.<br />If you're in ministry, this is a small, but worthy investment. Any passage you might have a question on will be answered in great detail. If you're a fundamentalist, you'll find it especially gratifying that Charles Stanley doesn't compromise on issues like speaking in tongues, the real meaning of repentance (one of the hi-lights of the book), and the security of our salvation.<br />I highly recommend this book. It will really compliment your study library.	2003-07-09

Terri Blackstock clearly has a knack for the whodunit, but what separates her from others is that she so carefully weaves in the faith element. In Southern Storm, as in her other works, the transformation in the lives of Karen, Sadie, and Blair are as important if not greater than finding the murderer and rescuing Cade. <br />I strongly recommend her books because they satisfy the reader's urge for great literature and yet he leaves feeling spiritually refreshed--as if it is not just a wasted excercise. What also is refreshing and encouraging is the way Terri deals with grown-up issues and tough life situations with grace rather than judgmentalism. In Southern Storm, you get the idea that these are real people dealing with real issues and real fears. Even the strongest Christians battle doubt and discouragment and even question the will of God. The reader feels kinship with the heroes and heroines who identify with everyday life struggles. <br />If you're hooked on reading, but would rather part with trashy romance novels, look no further than Terri Blackstock. It will be an experience you'll not soon forget.	2003-07-09

They have helped her spiritual life more than any other woman's books. <br />Jim George's book is no disapointment. As a bible teacher and scholar, he delivers a warm, easy-going, conversational manual for man seeking to glorify God with their lives. <br />The book is divided into easy-to-read chapters. He covers all the areas of a man's life and offers a gentle, but firm call for men everywhere to stand up and be counted in the spiritual battle. <br />A Man After God's Own Heart makes a great devotional read. I read a chapter a day for a month or so and it really helped me. I was challenged to be a better husband and a godly witness. <br />This is a great read and would make a great gift for the man in your life. It's not hard to read and it doesn't bog down with theological minutia. Jim George is talking to you man to man. <br />Men, pick up this book and read through it. Woman, get this book for your husbands. It's a great, great read.	2003-05-28

Runaway Jury is another Grisham classic. In this book, he manages to educate the common man to yet another side of the law--corporate malfeasance--without boring the reader to tears. In fact, his witty and humorous characters make the Runaway Jury a delightful read. <br />Grisham weaves complex plots. A powerful jury fixer, Rankin Fitch, is brought low by a cunning law student and his girlfriend, who manipulate the process to reach what they believe is a justice. Tobacco companies who have a motive. Lawyers who prop up a widow, waiting at the trough for their big payday. <br />Most poignant and inspiring in this book is the power of common citizens, avidly pursued by powerful interests who are frustrated in the end by the humanness of the jurors. Their independence leads to a common sense of justice. <br />You're led to believe that the jurors can be swayed, but in the final hour, they think the matters through and come to a conclusion. Unwilling to be pawns, they become players and make history. <br />Grisham has once again produced a masterpiece. Add this to the collection of his works already decorating your nightstand.	2003-05-19

You will absolutely not be able to put this book down and yet you will have no sense of guilt or shame at having read it, because you know the writer is committed to following Christian values. <br />What is also refreshing is that Private Justice doesn't follow a formulaic, Polyanish, everything-is-okay storyline. There are real people, with human flaws, who fail their families and their God. Christians make mistakes. Men are not Knights in shining armor and woman are not breath-takingly beautiful homemakers with perfect waistlines and no bad thoughts. <br />There is a marriage on the rocks that is put together only by God who allows tragic circumstances to force two independent belivers to come to grips with His will for thier lives. This book mirrors the real Christian life. You as a reader will at times wonder if Terri Blackstock has inside information from your life. <br />What I also enjoy is that Private Justice is so tightly written that she doesn't have to overwhelm the reader with unneccessary minutia about the field of police and fire and rescue. <br />This was my very first Terri Blackstock novel, but I can assure you that I will read many more. She has a wonderful storytelling talent. May God richly bless her work.	2003-05-19

I remember seeing her on nearly every national show and thinking, &quot;She's got great faith.&quot; Her husband's story is truly a wonderful inspiration for Americans. <br />I've just now read this book and perhaps that is why I was a tad disappointed in the content. That's not to say that Lisa's writing style is poor, its just that there is so much fluff. She talks at great length about both of their families and gives almost too much detail--pet names, family anecdotes, etc. <br />Over all, its an inspiring read and it was interesting to see how she found out about the towers falling down and when she found out about her husband being on the fateful flight to San Franscisco. <br />For Christians, its an inspirational read and I credit Lisa Beamer for being real, yet not bitter about life's circumstances. She truly trusts God and her faith is genuine. At the same time, she admits to times of loneliness, despair, and wondering &quot;Why?&quot; Yet, like Christians after God's own heart, she doesn't leave it there--she goes to God and shares her intimate thoughts. <br />I would encourage you to endure the sometimes dry sections of this book and read on. Sometimes we need to listen to the stories of people like Lisa, even if the details may not interest us. It is good therapy for their soul and gives us greater compassion for their plight.	2003-04-22

Bush, An Inside Account	Books	5	25	37	N	N	The First Insider Account of the Bush White House	The man who will forever be credited with the brilliant \\"axis of evil\\" phrase has written a well-balanced insider account of his short career at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. David Frum, who didn't seek White House glory and whose best work was on the pages of the Weekly Standard, delivers a rare look at the goings-on inside Bush's administration. <br />What readers will enjoy is Frum's admition of awe of history. Too often, Washington regulars forget to chronicle the privelege of serving their fellow citizens in the highest office in the land. Because it was his first and only job in government, David's book is filled with stories of excited calls home to his wife, emails to friends, and other such jubliation. <br />David is also a master of the English language. Like Peggy Noonan, he is a gifted writer, ably capturing the essence of Bush's governing style, behind-the-scenes encounters with officials, and the real-life personalities of larger-than-life figures like Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, Karen Hughes, and Condoleeza Rice. <br />If Frum's only fault is including a) too many personal stories or b) too much political theory, than he can be forgiven. Liberals will complain that he slants his views toward the Right, but he does his best to maintain balance and yet explain the subtle world of Presidential politics. <br />The Right Man is a book well worth reading, especially if you enjoy politics and especially if you admire President Bush. To hear a former skeptic acknowledge Bush's great qualities and insist that he is a godsend in these tough times is great and should help to win over many Bush-haters. <br />Pick this book up and put at the top of the stack on your nightstand.	2003-04-21

Once again, Woodward is at the center of the storm, sharing minute details of the early stages of President Bush's War on Terror.<br />I was very pleased with Woodward's objective approach. He didn't take a knee-jerk liberal or conservative bent--he just told the story. Obviously, his view of Rumsfeld may be a bit skewed because of limited access and yet pays him the respect he is due. <br />I particularly enjoy Woodward's deep bios of the main characters. I learned information about each member of the cabinet and I feel better informed for having read the book. <br />The biggest surprise of this book: the role of Condi Rice. Bob made it obviously clear how large a role she plays in this administration. I left feeling that she could one day run the country and had a keen sense of responsibility, leadership, and faith. <br />The only flaw is the subtle insistence that Bush is in over his heels. I think every writer is tempted to buy into the conservatives-must-be-dumb theory. For the most part, he gives Bush enormous credit and lets the American people understand that he is a man on a mission. <br />This is an extremely enlightning book and gives a real insider's account. Buy it and put it on your nightstand.	2003-03-07

One would think that Hometown Legend, a book that slipped under the radar, would be a lesser product, but it is not. <br />Hometown Legend is a wonderful story, especially those who enjoy football and understand the impact of this sport on small-town America. Jerry's characters are wonderful and yet flawed like the readers. It is isn't pie-in-the-sky fiction and yet it leaves feeling good when you're done. It proves the depth of Jenkins' abilities. He can produce heart-pounding fiction (Left-Behind) and homespun yarns. <br />This is a book that your entire family will enjoy. It's plot is very simple and yet is story and message resonate with millions of Christians who struggle by God's grace to make it through life. <br />Get this book and add it to your nighstand collection.	2003-03-07

Reading the Emperor of Ocean Park offers the reader a rare glimpse into the world of black academia. This book forces you to absorb the many cultural references and social commentary while keeping your attention with heart-stopping plot twists. <br />The man Talcott Garland is a well-thought out character, not easily pinned down. On one hand, he easily tires of the incessant whining of his liberal brethren, while rejecting the knee-jerk policies of reactionary conservatives. What's more exciting and intriguing is that his deep personal faith in the Lord is not viewed as a weakness, but a strength which revives Talcott's spirits while his life is crashing down around him. His plain-speaking Baptist minister is a friend and and advisor, not the crazy that many liberal elites would have wanted to paint him, but couldn't. <br />Stephen L. Carter has produced a rich, satisfying novel that is clearly the culmination of years of reflection. It is less a cheap page-turner and more a work of literary art. <br />I give this book four stars rather than five only because it is Stephen's first work and it sometimes, though not often, shows its clunky nature. Yet, I applaud this man for producing a great, unpredictable, and stimulating piece of fiction. I'm sure Carter's forthcoming novel will surpass even the lofty heights of The Emperor of Ocean Park. <br />Take the time to read this book--its definitely a keeper for your nightstand.	2002-10-21

What can they do when capitalism proves their elitist philosophies wrong? Why is it that conservativism sells in the thinking man's media: radio and print publishing? Confronted with the facts by articulate communicators like Hannity, all they can do is name-call, race-bait, and demonize. <br />This is not a heavy political treatise and Sean never pretends to be a Stephen L. Carter or George Will, but he is a passionate cheerleader for conservative values, American values. What's more he lack the pomposity of Rush Limbaugh, though he credits Maha Rushdie among others for his success. He is a true Reagan disciple. Hannity stands strong for bedrock American values but speaks his mind without going nuts. He's a true compassionate conservative. <br />I would urge people of all political stripes to read this book. It's a light read, but it is a basic primer for conservatives, drawing heavily upon Right media. Pick up this book and add it to your nightstand collection. You won't go wrong.	2002-10-07

Unlike most self-help bestsellers, George isnt' content to leave the reader depressed just like she wasn't content to say depressed herself. Instead, she takes us on the same journey through Scripture to find lasting, life-changing answers. <br />It wasn't until I read Loving God With All Your Mind that I realize how much control we have over our mind. We don't have to be besieged by worry and fear. We don't have to live in bondage to the opinions of others. We don't have to operate in a bubble of our own self-consciousness. Christians can rise above this by yielding their minds to the Holy Spirit. <br />If you never read any other Christian book, read Elizabeth George's excellent classic, Loving God With All Your Mind. Make a permanent place for it on your nightstand.	2002-08-27

Last Man Standing is the second book I've read and I must say he is an outstanding author, who mixes Grisham-like plotlines with his own brand of spy intrigue.<br />Last Man Standing is not merely a page-turner. It explores fully the depth of the human mind with the pyschoanalysis of super-shrink, Claire Daniels. The storylines is pleasantly complex, showing the frail side of tough guy Web London. London can bear the brunt of the physical nature of his job but breaks down at under a hypnotic physical examination.<br />Readers will also be torn by the paradox of Big Francis. A cold-blooded ruler of the underworld, he pulls out all the stops to save his son from being killed.<br />The only drawback to this book is the unusual amount of swearing. I realize that with any thriller there are evil men who don't speak Sunday-School language. Grisham, Jenkins, and others have proven that coarse language isn't necessary for a good plot.<br />Last Man Standing is a good read if you can manage to handle the language. Baldacci is definitely a writer who can both build suspense and distrust of federal agencies.	2002-08-07

Kent Hughes hits the nail on the head. The world in general and the church in particular is suffering from a lack of godly leadership. When pastors and longtime church leaders are falling into sin on a daily basis, Christians need a wake-up call to spiritual living. And it's the men who must take the lead. <br />This book is ten years old, but it has never been more relevant. Mixing biblical exposition with practical application, Hughes gives men a prescription for righteous living. <br />As hard as it is to take, this veteran pastor speaks to men on their terms. Carefully organized, The Disciplines of a Godly Man, goes through each phase of a man's life. It delivers Scriptural guidelines on issues like lust, pride, responsibility, and marriage. <br />Keep this book on your nightstand. Its a must-have for Christian leaders, including preachers, educators, and laymen. Men, take The Disciplines of a Godly Man and lead in the way God has called you to lead.	2002-08-07

I felt really inspired after I read Pastor Pritchard's delightful commentary on a prayer that has been repeated as much as any other piece of English literature.<br />What makes this book great is is Pastor Pritchard's down-home style. And When You Pray is not a deep, theological treatise. It is a delightful exposition, filled with relevant anecdotes and personal illustrations.<br />I would recommend this book to help jumpstart your prayer life and also as an encouragment in tough times.

It seems that the readership is so demanding. I find him a compelling author and his latest works further prove that he is an extremely versatile writer. The Summons is Grisham at his best with a little bit of Jan Karon's small-town familiarity mixed in. <br />I particularly like The Summons because it shows us the hassle of sudden wealth. So many are duped into believing that if they won the lottery, received an unexpected inheritance, or like Ray Atlee, found millions of dollars stuck in a closet, they would be happy. Atlee's life with the money was much more miserable than his life without it and all of the trouble helped him appreciate the ordinary life he was currently living. The debauchery of money-hungry lawyers also gives evidence to the depths at which one will sink to find wealth.<br />My selfish side would have enjoyed a more suspenseful ending, but I do commend Grisham for producing something refreshingly unpredictable. <br />John Grisham continues to be one of my favorite authors because of his tight writing, his satirical view of the rich and powerful, and his subtle compassion for the common folk. Many read his books for the suspense, but I read them for the messages and tough questions they raise and answer. Kudos to Grisham for another masterpiece.	2002-04-01

It was with great skepticism that I picked up Soul Survivor, because I know Yancey's feelings toward evangelical Christianity. However, I was pleasantly surprised at this book. Yancey is a tremendous researcher and wordsmith who is not afraid to put his true feelings on paper. That being said, I have some problems with Soul Survivor. Therefore, I give it a mixed review. There are some exceptional hilights in the book, but there are some lowlights as well. <br />The chapter on Martin Luther King Jr. was especially stimulating and informative, perhaps the most balanced evangelical perspective on the complex civil rights leader I have ever read. As a suburban, white Christian, I do not know much about King, save the cliqued stereotypes I've heard from his dissenters and the flatterring portraits offered by his fans. While Yancey doesn't gloss over King's moral failures, he also points out his tremendous impact on our society. I was also struck by the incredible racism of the white church in the deep south. This chapter is the highlight of the book.  <br />My problem with Yancey is that he has yet to get over his past. He has allowed his own deep spiritual abuse to color his perspective of evangelical Christianity to the point of negatively stereotyping every fundamental Christian as a intolerant whacko. We are not. There are many compassionate, loving souls who seek to honor Christ and uplift their fellow man, white, black, or green. Yancey seems to think we've all had the same bad experiences in church. We haven't. <br />I am particularly disturbed by Yancey's deification of those who've made a career of stumbling over the simple truths of God's Word. Those who trust God as what he says are considered simple, intolerant, and dumb while whose who made the simple things hard are portrayed as enlightened thinkers. <br />All that being said, I would recommend reading Soul Survivor, just for the great biographical information of Yancey's subjects. Please, however, do not assume that all Christians struggle with such questions of faith.	2002-02-11

I was not fortunate enough to live the Reagan years, watching him ascend from the B-movies to the leader of the free world, yet I have come to appreciate him for his mark on history. Peggy Noonan gives us the Reagan we have come to love--a determined man of core conservative ideals and a love for America. <br />I first appreciated Reagan when I heard him give an address at the 1988 Republican convention. Then, I made it a point to go back and study his life. As the years unfold, we are just now beginning to appreciate the tremendous impact this great man had on our country. He was conservative during a time when conservatism was dead. There were no Rush Limbaughs, Fox News Channels, World Net Daily's, or Weekly Standards. These are all a product of Reagan's stubborn insistence in an America-first brand of governing. <br />Peggy Noonan is not only an unabashed fan of the Reagan way as am I, she is a highly skilled storyteller. She so delicately chronicles behind-the-scenes tales from Reagan's rise to power. She gives the human side of this great man and explains the energies that drove him to single-handedly defeat communism, raise the national spirit, and give the next generation a model for good government. I would recommend every young person read this book and discover the remarkable man that lead our country during the 1980's--Ronald Wilson Reagan. Kudos to Noonan for a masterpiece in literature.	2002-01-14

It's a book that will challenge the doubts that typically plague the Christian in his endeavor to accomplish great things for the will of God. Wilkinson has successfully presented a biblical story but has resisted the temptation to embellish, stretch, or twist a Biblical theme to please an audience. His exegesis of Scripture is solid and accurate.<br />He presents the Jabez prayer as a formula or an way of thinking. Why can't we ask God to enlarge our territories? Why shouldn't we expect Him to bless our the vocation in which he has called us?<br />Dr. Wilkinson has stayed clear of prosperity theology and has also noted that sin can block the believers prayers from being answered.<br />The quality of the writing is good, if not great. He writes in an easy-going manner and offers hope to the Christian in any spiritual condition. You will be blessed by reading the Prayer of Jabez.	2001-06-05

My boss has been begging me to begin read these books, but I, due to the large stacks of books already decorating my nightstand, refused until she literally put At Home In Mitford on my desk with a (demand?) to read it. So, I shoved my other books aside and began. <br />And, I'm hooked. Jan Karon writes in very careful, thoughtful style. There are no page-turning plots, just the everyday happenstance of big people in a little town. Mitford is not a perfect place, but it is a place that I wouldn't mind living. <br />The goal of fiction is offer an escape by inviting a reader into a larger-than-life, idealistic, or fanatical world. Karon ushers helps us escape, but brings us to a world of everyday ups and downs and personalities and problems. She gives us a glimpse of people real thoughts and desires.<br />I thoroughly enjoy these books. The writing is so profound, so rich. The characters so lifelike and flawed. The plots so slow, yet moving, subtle, yet lifelike. <br />Many thanks to my persistent boss for shoving me into the wonderful world of Mitford. I now feel a kinships with Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, and the rest of the hilarious cast.	2001-06-05

As a young single man, I've read many books and have written on the subject. As an academic read, it is a phenomenal book but as an inspirational how-to, it falls a little short.<br />I agree with Hsu's basic premise. There is a subtle prejudice against single people in the church. They are often viewed incomplete without a spouse. Who hasn't heard the patronizing, \\"We've got to find you someone\\" as if nothing a single person does is credible until he becomes married. It is very hard to be taken serious in your Christian life if you are not married. Sometimes marriage isn't just a facet of the Chrsitian life--it is made to be the only thing in the Christian life. Hsu does a good job of echoing the frustrations of single believers who wish to be taken seriously and are (God forbid) content to wait for the right person.<br />Singles at the Crossroads is light on inspiration and anedotes and heavy on statistics. It's more of a \\"Leading Indicators of the Single Life.\\" Hsu may go a tad overboard with his overly academic approach. Plowing through the research may grow cumbersome. A little less Gallup poll and a little more Max Lucado would make this book an easier read. <br />When you do get to Hsu's point of view, he leans heavily toward singleness. Singles shouldn't be pressured into marriage, but I don't think they shouldn't be pressured not to marry if it is the right situation and God has his hand on the relationship.  <br />For a young inattentive reader, I would suggest Joshua Harris' two classics: I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. They are filled with real-world anecdotes. For an academic overview of the Christian single experience, Hsu's book fits the bill. <br />Though slightly cumbersome, Hsu's book addresses the needs of an increasingly growing evangelical demographic, provoking much needed dialogue about the mystery of dating and mating.	2001-03-16

As a Christian, this issue trips us up perhaps more than any area of our life. Mary takes an easy, often humorous approach as she gives some very practical steps on how to overcome our inborn inclincation towards laziness. <br />For the 1% of people who have their life completely in order, this book is not for you. For the rest of us who know what to do, know how to do it, but just cannot make our lazy selves do it--this is an inspiration. <br />I enjoyed the book immensely and it never got too bogged down or preachy in its tone. She has a balance. You don't get lost in generalities, yet she doesn't demand a laundry list of a thousand things to change your life. Simple, easy to follow lists accompany every chapter. <br />Very definitely an easy read for the discipline-challenged.	2001-03-16

I especially enjoy this book because Sweeting references many quotes from the classics, like Luther, Moody, Spurgeon, Havner, and others. <br />The only drawback, and it is a slight one, is that Sweeting tends to quote himself a lot. I enjoy his insight, but would have preferred he filled those long spaces with more classic quotes. <br />Nonetheless, its a great book and a handy reference tool.	2001-03-16

God has truly gifted Joshua Harris with an ability to speak His truth in a way that connects with our generation. He doesn't speak in heavy theological tones, yet he doesn't water down the Word either. <br />Boy Meets Girls is another classic in the mold of I Kissed Dating Goodbye. Joshua clearly defines his dating theology, now looking from the other side. Since publication of &quot;Kissed&quot; he has pursued and married a fine Christian woman. Now, he speaks on the godly way to find a godly woman. <br />I found Boy Meets Girl refreshing. It gives the proper biblical outlook on controlling our lustful passions, finding Christlike intimacy with our future mates, and focusing our energies on God's Will. <br />This is a good read for those struggling to find a mate, those recently stung by a broken relationship, and those who are in between. It resonates with young believers and senior saints. In his clear, lucid style, Joshua Harris clearly speaks for a generation of men and women who desire to serve God with their heart. Boy Meets Girl is a quality work and I highly recommend it.	2001-02-16

It seems that Freeman had something against ESPN with little to prove. <br />ESPN: An Uncensored History is a tiring read. It doesn't flow and it is full of the writer's slant and opinion, shaping unsubstantiated rumors into a very leaky case. Freeman would be better served writing an article with some of the allegations that have been made, rather than trying to stretch a few innuenedos into an otherwise boring book. <br />Also, it was too full of locker-room banter and crude jokes that he supposedly found. Why couldn't have just told the narrative about the rapid rise of this gigantic sports network?<br />This is a bad piece of investigative work. Don't waste your time with it.	2001-02-16

Beginning with a committment to God in her teens and ending with her committment to the same God as a senior citizen, &quot;Though None Go With Me&quot; tells the story of a modern-day, female Job. <br />Christians who feel as though life in Christ should be one big beach need to read this novel. It's not your typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; tome. It recounts over and over again a woman's suffering, God's gentle hand, and his overwhelming grace. <br />Jenkin's novels flow from the heart and speak directly to the Christian reader. He isn't overbearing in his descriptive approach, yet he colors the pages with timely adjectives and lively verbs. <br />Jenkins is a great and gifted writer for this generation of Christians. &quot;Though None Go With Me&quot; is just another example of his great work.	2001-02-16

I was particularly dismayed when he decided to join the Clinton White House. That being said, Gergen has penned a classic book on leadership. If your looking for dirt and sleeze in the White House, this is not the book for you. However, for those of us interested in learning what makes successful men successful, this is great read. <br />Gergen writes from a balanced viewpoint and clearly has no political axe to grind. He treats each man fairly, carefully examining the good and bad in each leader, from Nixon to Clinton.<br />With Nixon, he portrays a man he hoped would use his leadership for good, but who fell woefully short because of his dark side. With Clinton, he portrays a man who could have done the country much good, but never controls his self-indulging urges for sex, money, and power. <br />I can't say I agree with every point of his assessments of our modern leaders, but I'd be hard-pressed to find a better analysis of them. Kudos to Gergen for sharing the inside secrets of powerful men without shovefuls of unnecessary dirt. He's also to be commended for his likeable style. After reading &quot;Eyewitness to Power&quot;, I find a man who desires every one to succeed and a man with very few enemies.	2001-02-16

Parents, siblings, teachers and spouses hold us up to expectations of which we fall very short. <br />Dr. Scudder delivers a delightfully refreshing look at success and failure--in real terms. Closely examining the life of the Apostle Peter, Beyond Failure discovers the true secret of the Christian life. It's not about what we do or what we achieve. It's what Christ can do through us. <br />At first glance Peter was a failure--and so are we. Yet, at the end of his life, we was martyred for the Lord--the ultimate Christian success story.  He also wrote two New Testament books, which inspire and motivate Christians to this day. This embattled, impatient, impulsive apostle realized that true failure is not in the falling down, but in the staying down. We all make mistakes, put our feet in our mouths, and make poor decisions. The questions is will we use them as stepping stones to success? <br />Dr. James Scudder's Beyond Failure will inspire you to keep going--to finish the race. Filled with personal anedotes and real-world illustrations, this book is a much-needed oasis in a dessert of disappointment. Pick it up today and be refreshed.	2001-02-02
