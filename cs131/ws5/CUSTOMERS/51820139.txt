Just read the section where he advocates womens ordination. Sure he tries to appear a bit more objective then the usual dissenter. But in the end he says the same thing. I stand by my review. If I am wrong please point out where he advocates fidelity to received teaching. The answer to our problems is to be fully Catholic and NOT to water down the faith still further. That is what got us into trouble in the first place.	2003-10-14

It makes blatent errors about Catholicism that could have been solved just by looking in the catechism. I don't know any members of Opus Dei who are assassins. It smacks of how the Jesuits were portrayed in the 19th century. Amazing how anti-Catholic ignorance transcends time. No other religion gets treated this way or there would be cries of foul. Even non-Catholics will be offended by this book. Don't give the bigots your money. Buy something worthwile to read instead.	2003-09-13

In other words if it wasn't so...Catholic. We have already seen the decline that accompanies the authors \\"solutions\\". Just look at the Episcopal church. All of these kinds of books say the same thing ie. ordain women, gays, and basically ditch Catholicism. What is the real solution to the crisis? More fidelity to the truth as found in the deposit of the faith. Pretty simple, but obviously lost on the dissenters who seem intent on destroying what they profess to love.	2003-08-28

It is rife with errors and outright falsehoods. Some of it is pure invention. I suggest instead that you read the lives of the Catholic martyrs. Thousands were killed during the Reformation for the crime of being Catholic. This is a story that is often ignored by fundamentalists. Either out of shame, ignorance, or hypocrisy.	2003-08-28

Hopefully this will be the first of many exposes of anti-Catholic bigotry. He has done all religions a great service by revealing the discrimination and hate that are heaped on Catholicism. Usually in the name of tolerance and by the most \\"liberal\\" of people. People who would never make a remark or joke about Jews, Muslims, or African-Americans have no problem doing so about Catholics. This book is a good scholarly first step towards fairness and respect. Make sure your library has a copy of this book on its shelves.	2003-04-08

Here is a man who was rector of a seminary. Yet he takes no responsibility for the current problems. Instead he dares to offer advice. Penance would be more appropriate. I would ask him &quot;why didn't you fix the problems when you had the chance as rector?&quot; and &quot;why if there is a problem with homosexuals in the priesthood did you not take action and expell them?&quot;. The answer to our problems is more fidelty not less. Fr. Cozzens is part of the problem not the answer. For the real answers we need only look to Pope John Paul II. If we had simply done what he has asked us to do for years we would not be in this situation.	2003-03-13

It is like seeing an old friend again. Like many others I read it as a teenager. I almost stole it from the library since I could find no copies even in used bookstores.

When this series treated other religions they seemed to be careful to follow the official teachings of that religion. Yet here they give equal credence to official teachings and dissent. This is dishonest and biased. Don't depend on this book to tell you the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Catholicism. Get the Catechism of the Catholic Church instead.	2002-10-03

I was expecting something more objective. The author works hard to excuse things that are inexcusable. For example his defense of the fatwa against Rushidie was disturbing. Nowhere does he suggest that such a thing is barbaric. He simply says that we don't understand how much such books bother Muslims. That isn't the point. Killing someone for exercising free speech is a violation of universal human rights. Also he overlooks the current violent persecutions of Christian minorities in nations ruled by Muslim majorities. The Copts in Egypt would not say they are treated fairly and equally. And in Saudi Arabia there is no religious freedom at all. Even when he waxes poetic about Muslim Spain he doesn't seem to understand that the Spanish didn't necessarily enjoy being ruled by foreigners. The ones he lauds are the least Islamic, so what does that say? Why is Islamic colonialism acceptable, but Western colonialism is not? Would Islam have treated the Aztecs better then the Spanish did? I doubt it. They had no problem doing to the St. Sofia's in Constantinople what the Spanish did in the new world. Would he sympathize with Greeks who mourn the loss of their Empire to the sword of Islam? He doesn't seem too. These are just a few places where he neglects to challenge the Muslim side. This leads to the book presenting a one-sided picture that fails in what it says it tries to do. That doesn't help increase mutual understanding. Instead it shows that even a well-educated Muslim who teaches at Cambridge still doesn't understand us. That is quite sobering.	2002-09-14

It was in Italian and mine is not good at all. So it was delightful to find a book that gave the prefaces in English. I am hoping someone will do a translation of the whole Ambrosian Missal someday. It is a beautiful Mass and the prayers provide fruitful subjects for meditation. If you want something a little different then you will enjoy this book.	2002-09-14

It is the first in a 3 volume series that covers Mary from the Bible through the early Patristic period. Certainly it is quite good for scholars who are looking for a solid introduction to Mariology. It follows the guidelines set out in Lumen Gentium chaper 8 and the encyclical Marialis Cultus. A very solid work in general although it depends rather heavily on Fr. Raymond Browns views of the New Testament.	2001-03-02

It used to be that bigotry came from without now it comes from  within. Mr. Wills is no longer Catholic and has no business receiving the  sacraments. He wouldn't get them in my parish.

They took in those no one else does and do work that no one else will. I bet the author has never changed an AID's patients diaper. I also bet the other critics haven't done  it either. When I see them taking over Mother Teresa's good work then they  have the right to be critical. I never saw such hard working and dedicated  women as those nuns. Certainly the Indian people have expressed their love  for Mother Teresa during her funeral. These critics are typical liberals  who hate the church for opposing their anti-child and anti-family policies.  I guess my main question to them would be how many children have you saved?	1999-04-18
