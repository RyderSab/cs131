There are so many dynamics going on in the show (such as short term goals, i.e. winning the assignment; relating to team members; and of course dealing with The Donald, and his side kicks George and Carolyn), that makes it compelling viewing all around. Don't underestimate the Donald's factor. For proof, check the oh-so-lame new Martha Stewart Apprentice show.... boring!!!<br /><br />\\"Lessons from the Apprentice: Secrets to Success from the Boardroom to the Business World\\" (176 pages) is a high-end, glossy page book that takes you back to the first 3 seasons of \\"The Apprentice\\". While the book is structured to offer \\"lessons\\", it really is a fun look back of what worked and what went horribly wrong in the teams various assignments. With 20-20 vision, many of the mistakes that the losing teams made were so obvious (Ivana dropping her pants to \\"sell\\" chocolate bars? Danny's \\"Triple Play\\" act to get people into Burger King? etc.). There are plenty of pictures and quotes from the Donald, George and Carolyn, but also from the various business executives whose company products were on the line, and in that sense, yes, the book offers lessons.<br /><br />In the end, though, this is an irreverent look back at the first three seasons of \\"The Apprentice\\", and a good one at that. In a way, it reminds me of the 3 (so far) Simpsons books that \\"dissect\\" the episodes. If you are a fan of \\"The Apprentice\\", you will love this book!	2005-10-09

Call me either addicted or planning ahead (I've got one more to get through the college seach process in 2 years). \\"Complete Book of Colleges\\" (1,434 pages) is, in all but details, pretty much the same as the 2005 edition, not that it's a bad thing or it matters, as most readers will likely be new to the college search process, or restarting it after a few years off. The best thing about this book that it does offer a pretty good overview of the almost 1,800 colleges profiled in here. All of those colleges are profiled alphabetically, which makes it a bit less user-friendly. The fact is that the majority of kids look to colleges in their home-state, so why not have the colleges grouped by state? (There is, to be fair, an index in the back of colleges by state, among other indexes, such as size, environment, cost, and selectivity.)<br /><br />The biggest flaw in this book is that for some inexplicable reason there are a good number colleges profiled that lack information on tuition cost. How can that be? If the presumed defense of the writers is \\"well, the colleges didn't give us the information\\", there surely must be other ways to get it. Pretend to be an interested HS senior or something. All that said, this book is really an essential starting point for anyone in the college search process. But by no means should it be the end point. There are other sources out there, some serious, others irreverent, that will complement this book.	2005-09-17

Over the years he has written some great books, reflecting on US foreign policy, and this book is the latest, released earlier this year without much fanfare (or, alas, commercial success).<br /><br />The basic premise of \\"The Opportunity\\" (242 pages) is that the US in conjunction with other major powers such as China, Russia and the EU have a window of opportunity to steer the world in a direction of global cooperation and wealth, the key words here beinf \\"in conjunction\\". Haass makes a number of excellent observations in his book, such as:<br /><br />on globalization: \\"The choice before the US is between multilateralism and either a gradual return to a world of great power competition or a world overwhelmed by disruptive forces, or both\\".<br /><br />on terrorism: \\"It would be a mistake to conclude that there is global consensus on this matter. ... [O]ne man's terrotist is another's freedom fighter\\".<br /><br />on North Korea: Haass urges the US and others to set realistic goals to the North Korean government, with real consequences if those goals are not met.<br /><br />on the China/Taiwan conflict: \\"If the mainland were to use military force [for reunification], it should not be allowed to successfully reunify the country. Allowing it would set a terrible precedent for the region and beyond\\".<br /><br />on the US Security Council: Haass points out that it is ineffective because its composition reflects the world order half a century ago, not today's.<br /><br />on Iraq: Haass feels the invasion was \\"legal\\" but lacks \\"legitimacy\\", and moreover when a cost/benefit is made (considering how much the war has cost so far in expenses and lives lost, \\"the war against Iraq was unwarranted\\".<br /><br />This is a terrific book all around. Haass makes the excellent point in the concluding chapter that \\"for all its power, there is virtually nothing the US can do better without others. The US needs partners; unilateralism is rarely a viable option\\". Well said, and this book is highly recommended!its power, there is virtually nothing the US can do better without others.

The author spent more than 30 years working for the KBG, inculding two tours working from Washington.<br /><br />At the beginning of \\"Spy Handler\\" (338 pages), Victor Cherkashin (and ghost writer Gregory Feifer) makes clear that if one was expecting James Bond-like \\"jump out of the plane\\" situations, this is not the book for you. Indeed, Cherkashin explains that a lot of the \\"spy\\" related work is in fact very mondane work, sifting through lots of information. A good part of the book is devoted to 1985, the so-called \\"Year of the Spy\\", because so many deep penetrations on both sides (KBG/CIA) occurred that year. Cherkashin's most famous involvement is for \\"handling\\" both Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen when they decided to spy for the KGB, and those pages read like a Le Carre thriller, expect of course this is real leife, not some novel.<br /><br />Very interesting also is the next-to-last chapter, dealing with the post-1991 era. Cherkashin does not hide his disdain for Gorbachev, whom he blames for the break-up of the Soviet Union. Cherkashin left the KGB in 1991, and now runs a security firm. Somewhat ironic is that his daughter eventually married an American. That said, even though Cherkashin of course wants the KGB to \\"win\\", his repsect for his counterparts at the CIA and for the US is very clear as well. Overall, a very interesting book, even if you're not as such into \\"spy\\" stuff.	2005-09-11

I am generally not one to read fiction books. But of course as a birthday present, I felt I had to read it. And guess what, I actually enjoyed this book, quite a lot.<br /><br />\\"This Is Your Life\\" (313 pages) brings the story of Jimmy Conway, who is living a bland life as a part-time teacher in Southern England. Jimmy meets a major TV celebrity by chance when jogging one day. The celebrity dies the next day, and Jimmy somehow builds this encounter into a bit of 15 min. of becoming a B (or C) celebrity as a stand-up comedian whom nobody has ever actually seen perform (which he hasn't of course). Jimmy enjoys his new status, but then there is a major twist towards the end of the book, which I won't reveal, but it brings Jimmy back down to earth, realizing that his \\"bland\\" existance in fact was the best thing going in his life.<br /><br />This book is not a major literature statement, but it is hilarious (I laughed out loud many times throughout), and it does bring home an important message: you may want to be famous, but it isn't at all what you might think it may be, and instead you should enjoy the things you already have around you. Excellent book all around. Thanks for that birthday present, my daugther!	2005-09-04

Pleasant reading but nothing more than that	So the mystery of \\"Deep Throat\\" has finally been solved. In the ultimate irony for author Bob Woodward, it was revealed not by himself, but by Mark Felt's family (in a May, 2005 article in Vanity Fair).<br /><br />\\"The Secret Man\\" (238 pages) was rush-released in mere weeks after the Vanity Fair article. Woodward clearly had the basis of the book ready to go, \\"just in case\\" (i.e. if and when Deep Throat passed away), and then put the finishing touches on it. Couple of things: (1) the book clearly does feel rushed, almost unfinished, at times; (2) more importantly, there never was much of a deep relationship between Woodward and Felt, and therefore there isn't a whole lot to talk about. Woodward rehashes certain events in a historical context that have been described much better and in greater detail in other books before (such as \\"All The President's Men\\" and \\"The Final Days\\").<br /><br />This is not a 'bad' book per se, but there is not much remarkable about it either. We don't really learn a lot new. Carl Berstein gets to add a chapter  at the end, basically to tell us that, even though he is a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, he had no idea the revealing article was about to be published. Ok, Carl. As for Woodward, he's written a lot better books, and I'm sure he realizes that too.	2005-08-25

The stated premise is that the author goes on a roadtrip to visit the actual sites where \\"famous\\" (some more than others) rock musicians have died.<br /><br />\\"Killing Yourself to Live\\" (235 pages) is written by rock journalist Chuck Klosterman. It could've been a good book: Klosterman drops names like Interpol, Elliot Smith and Falco (just to pick those) at the drop of a hat. But instead of writing an irreverent book, the author somehow turns the book into an evaluation of his relationships with various women, and how weird and complicated it all is. After a while, the book becomes totally self-absorbed and I really had to drag myself to even finish the book. That said, there were a couple of passages that made me smile, such as Klosterman's visit to Graceland, concluding that \\"20 million Ellvis fans can, in fact, be wrong\\". Then there is the author's premise (and analysis) of how Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" album (released in October, 2000) foreshadowed 9/11. I don't buy into the premise, but it made for a couple of entertaining pages.<br /><br />Too bad the book wasn't more like that throughout. Instead, the author felt he had to share with us what his ups and downs are with the female species. As if we care! The most ironic line in the book comes when the author describes his dislike for LA, among other reasons, because people there are \\"unyieldingly narcissistic\\". You don't say Chuck!	2005-08-06

I have never done ecstacy in my life so I wouldn't really know the temptation or seduction of it.<br /><br />\\"Rolling Away: My Agony with Ecstacy\\" is written by 25 yr. old Lynn Smith. She brings us her life's story, and how she got into the \\"party scene\\" in NYC after graduating from high school in a small Pennsylvania town. The best part of book is Lynn's description of her ordeal in the psych ward, with utter desparation setting in. Apparently Lynn became somewhat of a \\"mini-celebrity\\" afterwards when she shared her story with MTV and MTV turned it into a special on ecstacy. The book ends somewhat open-ended, with Lynn returning to NYC, and an afterword 3+ years later telling us that she is doing well. I would've been interested to read how she coped day-to-day.<br /><br />Though not easy to read at times, this book is a powerful reminder of how addiction (of any sort) can destroy lives and families.	2005-07-23
US	52715519	RPQRM8GQZMK9Z	0375507108	349152576	My Life So Far	Books	4	3	9	N	N	Lady Jayne: one messed-up life with a late life-changing twist	I saw this book at my local library and couldn't resist picking it up. Couple of things right off the bat: 1. I just cannot believe it that Jane Fonda (whose birth-given name is Lady Janye Fonda--she decided to shorten it to just Jane at age 13) is now 68, I mean, when did that happen all of the sudden? 2. I had a hard time reading through the (long) section in the book where Fonda describes her anti-Vietnam efforts, and in particular the infamous visit to Hanoi, sorry.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the first 200 pages or so, where Jane goes into details of her childhood, in particular what is was like to grow up the daughter of Henry Fonda, as cold a father figure you will find anywhere. I really felt sorry for Jane (and others around her having to deal with Henry Fonda). It's no surprise then that Jane spends the next 40-50 years of her life going from one failed relationship to another, including 3 marriages (Roger Vadim, Tom Hayden, Ted Turner).<br /><br />As we get towards the end of the book, and you almost come to the seemingly inevitable conclusion that Jane Fonda, despite all her fame and fortune, really has had one long messed-up life, then comes the revelation that Jane has become a Christian a few years ago. Good for her! That seems to have given Jane a new sense of purpose and focus in life. Godspeed to you Jane!	2005-07-18

Of course there are many small towns across America, but not too many as isolated as Haines, Alaska, population 2,400, about 90 miles north of Junea.<br /><br />In \\"If You Lived Here, I'd Know Your Name\\" (281 pages) author Heather Lende brings us everyday stories of what life is like in Haines, Alaska. There is no story line in the book, just observations of what life is like in a place that is reachable only by ferry or by plane (no McDonald's!). Surprise, but even in a close-knit community like that, it turns out that there is trouble in the high school (less than 100 kids in total) with kids being picked on etc. Hende writes the obituaries for the local weekly, and that allows her to get even closer to the people in the community, and it comes across in the book. Her love for Haines is obvious, and affectuous. It makes me want to visit the place myself.<br /><br />No, this book is not some grand statement of literature. Instead, this is the perfect beach reading for the summer. \\"If You Lived Here\\" will take you to a place that most of us have never lived in, visited, or ever will visit.

Worthwhile reading for/re incoming college freshmen	My son and I went through the college search process in the past year (he'll start college next month), and we actually had quite a good time doing the college campus visits, narrowing down his choices, etc. Now that he is about to start college, I fell upon this book by accident.<br /><br />\\"Making the Most of College\\" is from some professor at Harvard whom I readily admit I've never heard about before. But the author actually makes a number of (seemingly) good points that I thought made a lot of sense (disclaimer: I did not go to college in the US but in Belgium, so I cannot easily compare it to \\"the old days\\"). The book does get tedious at times,and as such is not geared to/written for incoming freshmen but more for parents and teachers. I cannot imagine too many incoming freshmen reading through the whole thing (my son certainly did not), but I did discuss certain passages of the book with him. What good (if any) it will do him, who knows... only time will tell :-)	2005-07-08

Some of it serious, some of it not so serious.<br /><br />\\"The Insider's Guide to the Colleges 2005\\" is one of those to be taken not too seriously. If anything, I would suggest this is a good book to read, when your son or daughter is close to making a decision, and (s)he wants to find confirmation of impressions already made. My son concentrated his college search to colleges in the southern half of Ohio, and having visited a number of them, the descriptions in this book seem on target, in a general \\"gut check\\" kinda way.<br /><br />I certainly would not recommend this book as the most essential book to read when starting off on your college search. But it is a fun, irrevent look at the college scene, and the book should be taken as such, nothing more.	2005-07-08

Sobering True Stories Involving the Holocaust	I knew very little, if anything, about the book or its Polish author. What captured my attention was the subtitle of the book \\"And Other True Stories\\".<br /><br />\\"The Woman from Hamburg and Other True Stories\\" (260 pages) brings us 12 stories that in one way or another are connected to the Holocaust. Sometimes the story will be a straightforward account of a Holocaust survivor. At other times, the story ends up in places you'd never thought. For example, \\"The Back of the Eye\\", the longest of the 12 stories, initially concentrates on Stanislaw W., a concentration camp survivor, but eventually shifts to his son Stefan, who joined the Red Army Faction and is serving a lifetime sentence in Germany for his involvement in a brutal abduction with killings.<br /><br />I obviously cannot speak for Hahha Krall's original writing style in Polish, but in this translation it comes across with a very peculiar style. It is dry, at times emotionnaly removed, yet very observant. Writing about a young Jewish boy who fears he might haven eaten non-kosher food: \\"'You're only eight years old', his aunt consoled him. 'After you are bar mitzvah, God will forgive you everything'. He calculated that he could sin for five more years. Unfortunately, the war began before his bar mitzvah; God forgave him nothing.\\"<br /><br />The author does a great job in keeping you guessing where the stories will take you. While I lost interest in 2 of the 12 stories, hence no 5 star rating, this book is not only a great read, but of course also a reminder of the incredible horrors of the Holocaust. Highly recommended.	2005-07-05

I picked up this book, generally aware with the fact that Elizabeth Smart was abducted and eventually found alive. Other than that, I didn't know much.<br /><br />\\"In Plain Sight\\" (380 pages) is written by and from Tom Smart's perspective, the oldest brother of Ed Smart (Elizabeth's dad). It doesn't necessarily make for an easy read. Tom Smart comes across as a heavy-bearing guy with an healthy ego, even if all he has in mind is the best for everyone and wants nothing more than the safe return of Elizabeth. The first half of the book covers the first 10 days or so of Elizabeth's abduction, and is not compelling, as much as we all feel for the family. The book really takes of in the second half, when the weeks and months fly by. Even though the author makes clear he has not interviewed Elizabeth for the book, we do get a good sense of what her captors and Elizabeth were doing, drifting in Salt Lake and near San Diego.<br /><br />The Salt Lake City Police Department does not come across well in this account, being referred to at one point as the \\"Keystone Cops\\", as it eventually steadfastly focuses on Richard Ricci, who is arrested and eventually dies while in prison of a ruptured aneurysm, while all along the true abductors remain shockingly \\"in plain sight\\" around SLC and later in San Diego. \\"America's Most Wanted\\" John Walsh, instead, gets very positive write-up, and for good reason.<br /><br />The latter part of the book is most riveting, up to the eventual confrontation with the abductors and Elizabeth in suburban SLC. Even then it looked like things might go wrong, but when the author describes Ed Smart being reunited with Elizabeth at the police station, I admit I had tears running down my face. My prayers are with Elizabeth, that she can find a \\"normal\\" life as she grows older, after having suffered such a terrible ordeal.<br /><br />This book is riveting, shocking, and highly recommended.iveting, shocking, and highly recommended.	2005-06-23

The timing of his book couldn't be better of course, 2005 being the 40th anniversary of the band's start.<br /><br />\\"Searching for the Sound\\" is roughly divided in 2 halves: the first half of the book goes up to December 1969 (Altamont), and the second half covers the period since then. Not surprisingly, the first half is by far the most interesting (I rate it 5 stars), giving amazing insights and details on how the band started, how the members found each other and how the music came to be. Particulary fun to read are Phil's accounts of the band's frightful performance at Woodstock (many people don't realize that the Dead in fact performed at Woodstock, as they did not appear in the movie), as well as how the band, which was slated to be the next-to-last act (before the Stones) to perform at Altamont, refused to come out due to the \\"bad vibes in the air\\" (how right they were!). The second half of the book (I rate it 3 stars) is far less appealing, as it is too much of \\"we then went on tour again (fill in the year and the location)\\".<br /><br />Very surprising to me was that in the last 2 pages of the book, Phil refers to the Dead's \\"reunion weekend\\" at Alpine Valley in 2002 as \\"The Other Ones\\", but makes no mention whatsoever that in 2003 the surviving members decide to tour again (quite successfully at that) as \\"The Dead\\". (I must admit at being disappointed that the Dead are not touring this summer, given that this is the 40th anniversary of the band and the 10th anniversary of Jerry's passing away.) That said, this book makes for a mostly fun read, and if you like the Dead, this will make for an enjoyable beach read this summer.	2005-06-19

Best of 2005 (so far)	It's taking me a while to get through \\"The World Is Flat\\". This is not like some books that you can read in one afternoon or evening, such as Mark Burnett's \\"Jump In\\", just to mention another book I read recently. In fact, it's taken me several weeks, reading a chapter here and a subchapter there, and then letting it sink in for a while.<br /><br />There are some that are not buying into Tom Friedman's basic contention, which is (1) the opportunities/threats for more international competition for global trade and services are real, (2) power has shifted from states (up to 1800) to companies (1800-2000) to individuals at the start of the 21st century, and (3) the higher educational system in the US is not adequately prepared for the \\"quiet storm\\". To those that don't believe this, I feel sorry for them, for they are not in touch with the real world! My son is about to enter college in a few months, and I'm worried about the competition he will face coming out of college. I love Tom's story about his advice to his daughters: \\"Girls, when I was growing up, my parents used to tell me 'Tom, finish your dinner--people in India and China are starving'. My advice to you is: Girls, finish your homework--people in China and India are starving for your jobs!\\"<br /><br />Friedman does an excellent job in setting the table on how this all came about, in the so-called 10 forces that flattened the world, including the rise of the Intels and Googles of the world, the outsourcing and offshoring phenoms, etc. I strongly believe that, instead of trying to be protectionist for the sake of hanging on to a few more jobs for a few more years, America instead should find the inspiration to look at what's next to add value in the world economy of today, tomorrow and 20 years from now. Does anyone really believe that imposing quotas on Chinese textile imports will \\"save\\" the American textile industry (just to name one industry)? Hardly. At the same time, there are American textile companies thriving today by understanding the new global economic environment they are competing in and then taking advantage of it.<br /><br />I can't easily recall another book that has made such an impact on me. There is lots to be learned from Friedman's book, even if as you read it, it all sounds so self-evident (as I see it happen all around me). \\"The World Is Flat\\" should be required reading in colleges around the country. And this surely will be one of the best books (if not the very best) of 2005 when all is said and done.

I also was interested in Mark Burnett's personal story, as I'm an immigrant myself (from Belgium), coming over around the same time as Burnett.<br /><br />\\"Jump In!\\" starts off, strangely, with Mark's arrival in the US in 1982. He skips the first 22 years of his life entirely, making a casual reference to having been a paratrooper in the British army (and apparently having fought in the Falkland Islands war). The first chapters are the best, as Mark tells how he started of as a nanny (!), then went on to sell T-shirts on Venice Beach (very profitably), and eventually got involved in expedition-racing, first as a participant, later as a producer (the \\"Eco-Challenge\\" races). The best insider story on the Survivor series is that Survivor 4: Arabia was all set to be filmed in Jordan when 9/11 happened, and the decision was made (out of safety concerns) to alter location with a mere 8 weeks before the shooting of Survivor 4 was scheduled to start (and no delay was possible as CBS already had sold the advertizing for the show)... wow! While Burnett goes into the details of the logistical nightmares encountered in the Survivor series, don't expect a lot of insights on what happened on the show itself. Boston Rob and Rupert, probably the most important \\"characters\\" on the Survivor series, get mentioned once or twice.<br /><br />The book's release was timed to coincide with the debut of the Contender, which Burnett describes in details on how the show came about, and which he felt confident would be a huge hit. It's now 4 months and we know that the Contender was a miss (and not renewed by NBC for next year). But don't feel bad for Burnett, an Apprentice-like show with Martha Stewart will start in September. Meanwhile, this book is pleasant, and coulda shoulda been the ultimate insider's account of Survivor, but itsn't. Mark, the tribe has spoken!the ultimate insider's account of Survivor, but itsn't.

Ari does a great job giving us a sense what the daily pressures were like, facing the media day after day. The point Ari makes time and again is that the media try to trick him into saying things he doesn't mean or aren't accurate, trying to stir up conflict, because \\"without conflict, there is no news\\".<br /><br />One of the other points Ari focuses on is how slanted the 'mainstream' media are towards the Democratic viewpoint, and I couldn't agree more. I mean, how believable is CBS, NBC, ABC, the Washington Post and the New York Times (just to name those as an example) when you realize that 90 percent or so (as found when surveyed) of those journalists vote Democratic...<br /><br />Ari tells great inside stories such as what it really was to be with the President when 9/11 happened. Missing, though, is more insight into Ari's background growing up (he describes his Democratic upbringing until he became a Republican shortly after finishing college in a mere couple of pages). Hilarious are his tellings about Helen Thomas, the notorious \\"dean\\" of the White House press and self-admitted anti-Bush all the way. Turns out that Ari actually has a lot of respect for her and a great personal relationship outside of the media spotlight.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of hearing Ari give a presentation last Fall here in Cincinnati, and was really impressed with the man. That was before this book came out, and having read his book, I am even more impressed with him. This is a terrific book, and I highly recommend it.	2005-05-10

We've all heard about or seen the recent congressional hearings involving the issue of steroids in baseball. Who can forget Mark McGuire's sad \\"I'm not here to talk about the past\\" statement, over and over again?<br /><br />\\"Juiced\\" is Jose Canseco's autobiography and the thing that grabbed me was not that this was an apology, but rather a plea (!) for the use of steroids. Early in the book, Canseco writes \\"Yea, you heard me right: steroids, when used correctly, will not only make you stronger and sexier, they will make you healthier\\". Wow, you gotta have guts to write that. That said, Canseco has an ego bigger than his biceps. He claims to have \\"single-handedly changed the game of baseball by introducing [steroids] into the game\\". Urr, sure. The book is an easy read, with lots of fluff (such as Canseco's short semi-involvement with Madonna), the pages just fly by.<br /><br />The merit of the book is not the book itself. Rather, I am glad that this brought the issue of steroids in baseball to the forefront. It is ridiculous, looking back, how some of baseball's long treasured records have been blemished by steroids. Here's hoping that something will be done about that once and for all...	2005-04-11

Just recently I fell upon this book, and again I was attracted to read it.<br /><br />\\"Jewish Ritual: A Brief Introduction for Christians\\" is a more focused, less general book that \\"What I Wish\\", and in that sense a great complimentary read. \\"Jewish Ritual\\" gives a great overview of various Jewish rituals such as the observing the Sabbath, those complicated (to us Christians anyway) dietary laws (what is kosher, and why does it matter?), the practice of covering the head (when and how), etc. The authors do an excellent job at the conclusion of each chapter to discuss to what extent, if any, there is a similar practice in the Christian faith.<br /><br />The book is brought with obvious care, and respect for us Christians. Mutual respect and understanding is sadly lacking too often in our society. For that reason alone, this book is highly recommended. But if you have acquaintances in the Jewish community, or are simply curious to understand certain Jewish rituals better, this book is indispensable.	2005-04-04

Having lived through another long winter, the idea of reading a book in which summer plays a key role, was appealing to me. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />\\"In Summer\\" tells the story of Leo Peery, who has just graduated from high school and awaits going to college at the end of summer. Leo works as a life guard, and hangs out with friends and relatives, gets involved with girlfriend(s), etc. It's not the story line that is the problem, it's the writing that does not connect with me. It seems very detached. For example, at some point fairly early in the book, Leo finds out that his mom is dealing with a potentially terminal medical problem. One would expect that Leo is devistated, but somehow it doesn't come across the pages.<br /><br />In summary, despite the author's lenghty and numerous descriptions of the feel of summer as experienced by his 18 year old fictional character, I just didn't feel it and when I finished the book, I thought to myself, 'what did I read this for again?'. Not recommended.	2005-04-04

Looking for some books to read before going on vacation recently, I was drawn to \\"Suburban Safari\\" for a number of reasons, not in the least because I live in the 'burbs myself, with a backyard, and not much of a gardner frankly.<br /><br />\\"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn\\" is the hilarious tale by the author of how she experienced life in her yard for one whole year. It's amazing what all happens. Bugs, plants, birds, flowers, grass, it all grows and interacts in one way or another. From the book inside cover, I gather that Hannah Holmes has made her name through various science-related writings. It goes to the author's credit that she keeps the book as unscientific as possible, and with a healthy dose of humor. The pages just fly by. In all, if you're looking for a fun yet informative read, \\"Suburban Safari\\" easily fits the bill. Highly recommended, and I know that I won't look at my backyard ever the same way again!	2005-04-04

This book came highly recommended to me by a friend, and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, \\"Brick Lane\\" tells the story of a Bangladeshi woman named Nanzeen who moves to London in an arranged marriage. After 10+ years of living life fairly uneventfully and raising her 2 young daughters, Nanzeen ultimately becomes involved romantically with another man, Karim, also of Bangladeshi descent. When Nanzeen's husband decides that the family should relocate back to Bangladesh, Nanzeen is forced to make a decision: follow her husband back to Bangladesh, or staying in London with Karim. Or is there a third option?<br /><br />Monica Ali takes her time developing the characters, which works well actually. Nevertheless somewhat distracting in my opinion is the side-story involving Nanzeen's sister who has remained in Bangladesh. It takes up quite a bit of the book but ultimately has really nothing to do with the resolution of Nanzeen's life choices.<br /><br />The book's inside cover points out that Ms. Ali herself is from Bangladesh and now lives in London. Obviously she knows what she is writing about, even though the circumstances of her move to London are presumably quite different from the fictional characters in the book. But it does beg the question what Ms. Ali will write about next, I mean, how many times can you approach the Bangladesh-to-London story? Meanwhile, \\"Brick Lane\\" is a very engaging book, and as highly recommended it came to me, I can now recommend it on to the next person.	2005-04-03

I am neither a Celtic fanatic, or even a big NBA fan for that matter, but I am a sucker for a good story teller, and boy, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Let Me Tell You a Story\\" (346 pages) grew from Feinstein attencing the weekly luncheon get-togethers that Auerbach holds every Tuesday in a Chinese restaurant in Washington DC. One thing lead to another, and before we know it, we have a book containing many of those fun and entertaining stories of hoe Auerbach broke into basketball, got into coaching at the NBA when the league was started, and eventually coached and later general-managed the Celtics into the league's powerhouse. I didn't know that Auerbach's life was centered in Washington,  even when he coached the Celtics. As a George Washington U. graduate myself, it was fun to find out how big a supporter Auerbach is of the GW basketball program (Auerbach is an GW alum himself, class of 1940). The story about how he had GW finally get some really good hot dogs at the games nowadays, is hilarious.<br /><br />Auerbach is an impressive person, with a  memory of steel. His recollections of the early days are priceless, and Feinstein writes them up in an effortless and entertaining way. Is this a \\"deep\\" book? Of course not, but it sure makes for a great read.	2005-01-15

I wish I had found a book like this years ago! I stumbled upon this recently, and immediately knew this book was meant for people like me.<br /><br />\\"What I Wish My Christian Friends Knew About Judaism\\" (270 pages) is a delightful book. The author, in plain and simple language, gives an introduction of what \\"being jewish\\" is all about. Most chapters are easy to understand 2 to 3 pages addressing particular aspects of Judaism, such as what a bar mitzvah is, what the holy days in the Jewish year are, even explaining the Jewish calendar (just add 3,761 years!). Confused about \\"Orthodox\\" versus \\"Reformed\\" Jews? It's explained here. Wonder how the Jews feel about controversial issues like homosexuality or abortion? It's in here! Don't understand the concept of \\"kosher\\" food? Read about it here! And so on.<br /><br />The author brings this book with obvious warmth and respect for us Christians. I cannot emphasize enough how important I feel this book is. In my opinion it should be required reading in all high schools and colleges, as it promotes a mutual understanding and respect that is sadly lacking far too often in our society.	2005-01-03

Bush\\" came out in late 2003, but I didn't pick this up until the paperback edition was issued in 2004. I read it while on vacation this summer, and re-read it recently. While not a hefty volume (190 pages), the author covers a LOT of ground, and it was definitely worthwhile to re-read it.<br /><br />In \\"The Faith of George W. Bush\\", author Stephen Mansfield covers how religion has been a part of George W. Bush's life, from growing up in Texas to the high school and college years in New England to the aimless years thereafter, and finally as Bush finds his groove (Rangers baseball co-owner, Texas Governor), on his way to the White House. One thing that becomes clear is that while of course there are a number of pivotal evolutions in the growth of Bush's spiritual life, there was not one single event that causes Bush to become born again. Just a couple of anecdotes from the book that stayed with me: on running for President, Bush says (in early 1999) that \\"I feel like God wants me to run for President. I can't explain it, but I feel my country is going to need me.\\" This was 2 years before 9/11, wow. Bush on the success of faith-based initiatives while he was governor of Texas: \\"Government can do certain things very well, but it cannot hope in our hearts or o sense of purpose in our lives.\\" So true!<br /><br />The author makes clear that George W. Bush has committed many mistakes. Let he who has never made a mistake himself, throw the first stone. The reason why the President resonates well with a majority of this country is that he \\"talks the talk, and walks the walk\\". This is a wonderful book. Highly recommended!	2004-12-23

Bush	If you know that Paul Kengor, the author of this book, also wrote \\"God and Ronald Reagan\\", you know, even before you have read a single page, that more likely than not, you will be reading a worthwhile book. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />\\"God and George W. Bush\\" continues along the path of the earlier \\"The Faith of George W. Bush\\", which was an excellent book. The main difference between the two is that Paul Kengor is focused more on how Bush transplants his religion into nut just his every day life, but even more so in political action. One of the more noteworthy things I came away with from this book, is how Kengor shows (and backs it up with plenty of research and footnotes--about 60 pages worth of them!) how the 'separation of church and state' issue is misunderstood and even misconstrued. Did you know that the expression 'separation of state and church' is not in the Constitution? The author then goes on to demonstrate how the founding fathers commonly and openly had a place for their faith in God in their public lives.<br /><br />\\"God and George W. Bush\\" is a winner because of the care the author took in setting forth positions. The positions are based on facts and research, not on some 'gut feeling' or instinct. Over the years, as people in the US have come to known the President better, it is clear that a majority is comfortable with the way the President lives by his faith and 'walks the walk\\". This book elegantly shows how.	2004-12-22

To say this book is moving would be doing it grave injustice, as it goes way beyond that.<br /><br />\\"Your Father's Voice: Letters for Emmy About Life with Jeremy Blick--and Without Him After 9/11\\" is meant to be a collection of letters from mom Lyz to be read someday by daughter Emmy, all of 3 months old on 9/11, about how a loving and doting father Jeremy was, in many ways the more natural parent than Lyz herself, and Lyz readily admits so in the book. The book also paints a detailed picture how Lyz and Jer first met each other and were meant for each other, even though it took them quite a few years to fully realize it and actually get married.<br /><br />The accounts by Lyz of the post-9/11 days, on how to deal with the grief, the endless inquiries from the FBI and other government officials, but also well-meaning if intrusive regular people, are heartbreaking. Yet one thing that struck me is how little reference Lyz makes to faith or Christ, even in the darkest of hours. Even though Jer and Lyz married in a religious ceremony, religion and an ultimate trust in the Lord (even if we cannot understand why certain things happen the way they do, we do know the Lord has an ultimate reason for everything) are strangely absent. Anyway, this book is highly recommended on many accounts. I wish Lyz and Emmy Glick nothing but the best as they try and move on with their lives.	2004-12-13

But I am, and I did. This book is, as the Donald says himself, a straight-forward sequel to the equally succesful \\"How to  Get Rich\\".<br /><br />\\"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire\\" is a quick read, just 229 pages, and they're not top-to-bottom filled at that. Lots of quick thoughts, just over a page or 2 pages long. But Trump does give a couple of good tips. Such as in the introduction, about thinking like a billionaire: \\"Don't take vacations... Have a short attention span... Don't sleep anymore than you have too... Don't depend on technology... Think of yourself as a one-man army...\\" etc. Or on how to impress anyone in business: \\"Be on time... Make a mental dossier on people... Let other people talk... Be self-depreciating and disarming...\\" etc. It all sounds pretty evident, but not really! There is a chapter on \\"The Apprentice 2\\", with an inside look on the first 4 episodes. Nothing mindboggling, but it does show that the Donald is very involved and hands-on with the show.<br /><br />If there is anything that bothers me in the book, it's the endless gratuitous name-dropping, it just doesn't stop and most of the time just self-serving. Reading this book certainly won't get you much closer to becoming a billionaire, if that is your objective. That said, this is a pleasant \\"quickie\\" read, nothing more, nothing less.	2004-12-05

I'm a big Dylan fan, and as much as I enjoy listening to the albums, I've always wanted to better understand the lyrics. Well, consider that problem solved with this book.<br /><br />\\"Lyrics 1962-2001\\" is the solution to my problem, a 600 page (hard cover) book, containing the lyrics to all Bob Dylan's songs. The book is arranged album-by-album, and song-by-song within those albums, and contains in addition the words to other songs that were not originally on any album.<br /><br />Bob Dylan towers over the music scene like few others, and his word-crafting has no equal. This book is essential, not just for Bob Dylan fans, but for any serious music lover. I bought this book from Amazon.com, for a mere $27 (S/H included), 40% off the cover price, one of the best bargains ever. \\"Strongly recommended\\" doesn't do justice, this is simply essential.	2004-11-27

The author, Gary Spivack, was a record label executive at Capitol (he's since then departed) and responsible for marketing/supporting Coldplay in the US.<br /><br />\\"Coldplay: Look At the Stars\\" is Spivack's personal take on how Coldplay broke the US market, and in that it succeeds. He obviously had a lot of contact with the band, and that is where the book succeeds. My favorite part of the book is Gary's recollections on Coldplay's first American tour in February, 2001, for no other reason than I happened to see Coldplay in Portland, OR (the second stop in the US). You could just feel the magic in the air, a band that was about to make it really big.<br /><br />The author doesn't spend a lot of time on how the band actually formed and where it found its musical origins, and that is the major failing of this book. Nevertheless, this is a quick and pleasant read. Spivack recounts his sacking from Capitol in early 2003, and how quick Chris Martin was there to console him (by phone). But for the definitive Coldplay story, we will  have to wait another day and another book.	2004-11-27

After a 12 year lay-off, the Rolling Stone Album Guide returns with its 4th edition.<br /><br />First, the positives: it's nominally the 4th edition, but in reality pretty much an all-new book, as it should be, given the 12 year lay-off. Reading it now, it's good to see that recent releases such as PJ Harvey's \\"Uh Huh Her\\", the new Libertines CD, Jill Scott's \\"Beautifully Human\\", just to name a few, are covered. The writing is generally well done. Be aware, though, that many of the writing is very opiniated. For example, Weezer's \\"Pinkerton\\" is rated 5 stars, above all other Weezer albums. Huh?<br /><br />That said, there are a lot of negatives as well, unfortunately. Leaving out certain artists is a judgement call, but as to certain oversights (such as Metallica and George Harrison) I must believe that is was an editing error (I hope!). Other entries are incomplete, for example leaving out Natalie Merchant's excellent 2003 release \\"The House Carpenter's Daughter\\", Rod Stewart's 2003 \\"Great Storybook Vol.2\\" or the seminal 2002 Stone Roses compilation \\"The Very Best of the Stones Roses\\".<br /><br />In the end, this pales to the \\"All Music Guide to Rock\\", the most recent edition of which was released in early 2002, but which gets updated constantly on line. The \\"Rolling Stone Album Guide\\" may be ok for the casual fan, but for the rest of us, this is not good enough (even though many of us will purchase it anyway or have purchased it already, like myself).	2004-11-26

Dylan essentially serves up 3 snapshots of his life in this 300 page first volume of a reputed three volumes: his early days in Minneapolis and New York, prior to making it big; his disenchantment with fame and fortune era-1971; and his recording of the Daniel Lanois-produced \\"Oh Mercy\\" album in 1987-88.<br /><br />Couple of things that struck me while reading this: first and foremost, Dylan must have a memory of steel. I mean, he recounts his early days in New York (era-1961) with simply an incredible amount of detail and color, and yes, even name-dropping. It's like a painting coming to life in your mind, and like you are right then and there. Second, it's hard for some to accept (see reviews below), but Dylan makes it perfectly clear he never wanted to be the 'spokesman for a generation' and in fact flat-out refuses it, going to extreme lengths in the early 70s to try and change his image. Third, for anyone expecting personal stuff, forget about it! Dylan will refer once in a while to \\"my wife\\" in the various chapters, and that's it. Good for him. Finally, the \\"Oh Mercy\\" chapter gives great insight on how Dylan and Lanois struggled through their disagreements to deliver a pretty good (but not classic) album. Dylan must've been pleased as he asked Lanois to produce \\"Time Out of Mind\\" in 1997. This book covers such much, yet so little. Just imagine how much more is yet to come!<br /><br />Some retailers provided a (free) accompanying \\"Chronicles Volume One Limited Edition\\" CD. The CD (6 tracks, 18 min.) is notable for including a previously unavailable track, \\"The Cuckoo\\", recorded live at the Gaslight in NY in 1962. The audio quality is surprisingly good (coughs from the audience are clearly heard at one point, though). Also included is a previously unreleased demo of \\"Dignity\\", which Dylan discusses in the book. The other 4 tracks are 2 songs each from the \\"New Morning\\" and \\"Dignity\\" albums which songs Dylan also discusses in the book. In all, a terrific CD for the inclusion of the previously unavailable tracks. And the book is a must, not just for Dylan fans, but for anyone wanting to understand better the beginnings of one of rock's great legends. And when he comes to your town this year or next, please go see him!

Highly Recommended, and not just for Christians	At a recent Sunday sermon, the minister in our church spoke to us again about why bad things happen, in the context of \\"Avoiding the Ultimate Disaster\\" and Luke 13:1-9. As if by coincidence, a few days later I saw this book, and I picked it up. It's one of the most common questions that I hear raised by those people that aren't religious: why does God let bad things happen, why doesn't he do something about (fill in the blank/take your pick of the latest world disaster). It is indeed a perplex question, but one that has an answer.<br /><br />In a short amount of space (115 pages), Anne Lotz not only explains why, but gives guidance on how to deal with the issues of suffering and pain (\\"trust in God\\" being the key factor). Very helpful is that the author writes about these complex issues in very plain-spoken English. Most importantly, this book provides a message of hope, namely that even though this is far from a perfect world (as the result of humanity having received the gift of choice, which inevitably includes the freedom of bad choices by many), there is HOPE, as long as one trusts in God. Excellent book, and highly recommended for everyone, not just Christians.	2004-10-20

I basically ready it cover to cover, non-stop, one recent weekend. How did the Class of 93 of Thomas Jefferson HS in northern Virgina turn out, 10 years later? The writer, himself a TJ 93 grad, focuses on 16 people (out of a class of 404), with himself interwoven throughout the book.  The writer's basic premise is that 1993-2003 represents the \\"real\\" 90s decade (starting with Clinton's presidency, and ending with the start of the war in Iraq, with the internet Boom and Bubble, Monica Lewinsky and of course 9/11 along the way).<br /><br />The best part of the book is (not surprisingly) to see how people change over a period of 10 years. In fact, it would appear that may, if not most, of the '93 TJ grads turn out very different after 10 years than their HS graduation would have lead most to believe or expect. One of the best stories involves Karen Taggert (yes, the reviewer right below me), who ends up teaching inner-city schools in DC. Another compelling story is John Doyle, the rigid military-reared (with accompanying strong views) kid who goes to West Point and undergoes a major change after doing his 5 yr duty in the military. I equally disagree with David Jacobs' review that the inclusion of the chapter on Sean Bryant (who took his life in college) was disrespectful or exploitative.<br /><br />If there is one common thread throughout the stories of these now 27-28 yr olds looking back at high school, it's that many of them don't really seem all that happy! \\"We were prepared to be successful but not to be happy\\" is a statement that comes back more than once. Wow, that worries me (having 2 kids in HS now).<br /><br />The last chapter, on the actual 10 year HS reunion, is somewhat of a letdown, after reading so many fascinating stories. But then again, isn't any HS reunion a letdown? It doesn't diminish the value of the book. Ultimately, the writer did an excellent job in making a bunch of strangers into compelling persons. Highly recommended! (And a sequel 10 years from now would be most welcome...)strangers into compelling persons. Highly recommended!

I had vaguely heard about the book, primarily because of the sub-plot involving one of the high school kids trying to get John Mayer to perform at the prom.<br /><br />As it turns out, this reads like a baby eats candy: effortlessly. The author (a senior writer at Sports illustrated) follows the high school kids at Pennsbury HS (in suburban PA) for the entire 02-03 academic year. He picks about 10 kids around which to focus the main developments through the school year, and it really is a soap. Will the football team QB get a scholarschip at a big school? What happens to the prom queen with the mysterious boyfriend that nobody ever sees? Can the go-get-'em junior really convince then pre-Grammy winner and up-and-coming John Mayer to play at the prom? Before you realize it, you are turning the pages, eager to find out how it all plays out.<br /><br />When I'm on vacation, on a beach, this is exactly the type of book I want to read: entertaining, engaging, not too complex, yet real. Highly recommended for brainless, effortless summer reading!	2004-08-18

Bush, An Inside Account	Books	4	6	14	N	Y	Interesting Insights, But Probably Not for Everyone	I have read a number of the reviews, and am somewhat disappointed that many reviewers take this space to express their own political views (generally along the lines of how \\"bad\\" a president George Bush has been), but not enough about the merits and entertainment value of this book. I mean, isn't that why we read books (or listen to a CD or watch a movie)? We want to be entertained, and maybe (hopefully) learn a thing or two along the way. On those standards, \\"The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush\\" passes the test easily. I read this book recently while on vacation, on a beach, to give you an idea of my state of mind while reading this book.<br /><br />David Frum was a speechwriter on economic issues for about 14 months (early 2001 to early 2002). Is the account of the Bush-insider self-serving to a degree? Sure it is, but what's wrong with that? (Do you believe for one second that Bill Clinton's autobiography is not?) What appealed to me most were Frum's observations and insights on the \\"power struggle\\" between Karl Rove and Karen Hughes, and around them. In fact, for a White House administration that on the outside comes across well-disciplined, the overwhelming feeling one gets is that EVERYTHING is a power struggle. How anything ever gets decided anymore, is amazing to me.<br /><br />The Amazon.com editorial review is sceptical that Frum left on his own device. I never got that impression. Frum's explanation that in a post-9/11 landscape, where economic issues are secondary to fighting the war on terrorosm, and therefore the need for a economic speechwriter is greatly diminished, came across as reasonable and credible to me. Maybe I'm just naive, who knows. In any event, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and that's good enough for me, although I imagine that many of the anti-Bush zealots may feel differently.	2004-08-18

Hmm, I tought that looked pretty interesting. I was not disappointed, it was a compelling read all around.<br />The basic premise of the book is that Shaun Briley (the son of Jon Briley, who scripted the &quot;Gandhi&quot; movie blockbuster) and his girlfriend are living uncomfortably with her mom in the UK, and so decide to go on vacation to Spain to escape the mom. Totally unplanned they end up buying a rural farm house in deep Spain, thinking this would be eternal bliss of sun and coctails. The book cronicles the pair's misadventures in adjusting to that rural life (no modern amenities we take for granted such as electricity, bathroom, etc.), while at the same time describing the ups and downs, and ultimate demise, of the couple's relationship.<br />Briley writes with a great sense of humor, and the pages fly by. As a transplant myself (but not to a rural setting), I took an immediate liking to the book, and found it hard to put down. I highly recommend as perfect beach reading for the coming summer!	2004-06-13

What sets this reference book apart from its competitors is the detailed album-by-album review (and rating) of the artists. A good example is how the editors treat Bob Dylan's career and its 40+ (and counting) albums.<br />The book cover albums issued before or no later than October 2001, so you will find reviews on albums such as Dylan's \\"Love & Theft\\" and Collective Soul's \\"7even Year Itch\\", but you won't find, say, Radiohead's \\"I Might Be Wrong--Live Recordings\\" or Natalie Merchant's \\"Motherland\\". Of course, as the editors note, this book is culled from the vastly more expansive on line version of All Music Guide, which obviously is also updated more frequently. The book has some curious omissions (what, no listing for Creed?) and out-of-proportion reviews (3+ pages on The Fall, about the same as for the Beatles!).<br />In the end, those are minor quibbles. While the on line version is more complete and up to date, I also want to have something I can physically leaf through (same reason why there are still actual newspapers, I guess). Let's just hope that it won't take another 5 years before the 4th Edition sees the day of light! Meanwhile, we will do with this. BUY IT!	2002-04-24
US	52715519	R1YRQQ52KCDH2Y	0804821054	360723930	The Accidental Office Lady	Books	4	5	6	N	N	The Accidental Appreciation of Laura Kriska	Ms. Kriska recently gave a presentation at the Japan America Society here in Cincinnati, which I attended at the last minute, by accident so to speak. Following her lively presentation, my curiosity was peaked enough to  buy the book. As it happens, I had to fly to Los Angeles a few days later,  and settled in for 4 hours on interrupted reading. Ms. Kriska writes as she  comes across in person: witty, smart, engaging, understanding, forgiving,  yet always with an agenda to be accomplished (in her book: the  &quot;uniform policy&quot; episode; in her presentation: to get the  audience to buy the book), for which she does not apologize (nor should  she). Ms. Kriska's eye for details is impressive, even more so realizing  that the book was written some 8 years after the events. Unexplained both  at the presentation and in her book is what exactly caused the long delay  in starting and/or finishing the book. That aside, anyone looking for a  good international &quot;human interest&quot; story or for that perfect  summertime poolside reading, this is a can't-miss book, guaranteed to make  you smile along the way. And it made my flight to/from Los Angeles  seemingly so much shorter!	1999-06-25
