However, don't be fooled by the brevity.  The author provides shares real-world experiences and lessons learned over a lengthy career as a consultant.  There is no fluff or philosophical preaching here.  The author provides information he wishes he had known when he started his consulting practice.  These kinds of tips are invaluable, and this book overflows with them.  Concise, well written, well done!	2005-08-26

Some of the stories are interesting and intriguing.  Others are less impressive and insightful leaving the book as a whole something of a mixed bag.  The explanations in this book are simple enough that anyone should be able to follow them.      Chapters  2 and 3 were weak.  Chapter 2 was about some kids hacking for terrorists.  There wasn't enough detail for me to believe the story, and the story itself was most unimpressive.  The Chapter 3 was about some convicts wrangling computer access in jail.      Chapters 1, 4 and 5 were pretty good.  Chapter 1 was about hacking the casinos by reverse engineering a slot machine.  In chapter 4 some kids hack into Boeing, and the security guru tracks them down.  Chapter 5 provides some insight into how Lamo works.      Chapters 6 through 10 are either about penetration tests or the wrong-doings of some who call themselves white hats or security consultants.  I found the exploits in these chapters to be pretty well documented and more educational/useful than some of the others.  While I think everyone can agree that authorized penetration tests are a good thing, I think there's something seriously wrong with someone who plays security consultant by day and steals software by night.  These folks show know better.  The lack of ethics demonstrated by some who claim to be \\"good guys\\" both disturbing and eye opening.      I was not as impressed by this effort as I was Mitnick's previous book, but perhaps my expectations were too high.  It's still a decent and easy to read book overall.  While it's no masterpiece, it's well worth the price; I'd buy it again.  I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars.  I must truncate to 3 based on the weakness of chapters 2 and 3 the uncoolness demonstrated by some of the consultant-by-day, cracker-by-night types in latter chapters.	2005-05-26

Those new to compilation with GCC and friends should start here.  I wish I had an introduction like this when I was getting started.  It could have save me a lot of research and confusion.   <br /> <br />Most readers will move through the 87 pages comfortably.  Gough explains the basics skipped by others.  Goug's writing in concise and crystal clear.  Each chapter has a couple of simple examples that really get the concepts across.  Even someone who types slowly could get through this text and all the examples with ease.  Those who choose this book will be rewarded with a clear understanding of GCC basics.  Other commands covered include g++, ar, as, nm, file, ldd, ld, gcov, gprof, and cpp.  Topics include compiling C compilation options, preprocessor, debugging, optimizing, C++, platform specific options, related tools, and troubleshooting. <br /> <br />I say four stars, because I'm going to need more detail on some things.  However, this book is probably sufficient for many.  The writing is great and the price is right.  I'd buy it again. <br />	2005-04-29

Rather than reiterate what other reviewers have said, I'll focus on a few other things worth a mention.      The first two chapters provide a solid foundation for Google use.  They can be read and understood by anyone.  The knowledge presented in these two chapters alone can make your queries much more efficient.  Usage for each operator and searching technique is explained in detail, so that the fundamentals can be applied to any search.  These two chapters comprise the best Google tutorial available anywhere!    The rest of the book focuses on techniques relevant to security testing.  There so many ways to use Google to enumerate information.  The author walks your through each of the techniques and the principles behind them.  The examples expand upon and reinforce the techniques discussed in the first two chapters.    I also own the O'Reilly \\"Google Hacks\\" book.  It's a good book mostly consisting of tips geared towards coders looking harness Google's power for miscellaneous purposes.  Although Johnny Long's book does present plenty of code and techniques for automation, its primary focus is using Google's relevance to security testing.  Defensive techniques (how to limit what googlebot crawls) are also discussed.  \\"Google Hacking\\" makes a better starting point for those interested in security testing.	2005-04-01

It certainly lives up to that by concentrating on more fundamental knowledge.  Among it's strong points, this book is the most solid introduction to vulnerability discovery techniques I have seen.  Another point to this books credit is that I was unable to find any errors in the examples I ran (about half) <br /> <br />The authors start out with a 4 chapters that discuss things like... what pen-testing is, ethics, legal issues.  Some of the more useful discussions in this section include legal issues, and reporting vulnerabilities to vendors.  Some of the less useful discussions include the difference between gray, white, and black hats.  Omitted was discussion the true old schoool meaning of 'hacker.'   The first 4 chapters rate three stars. <br /> <br />Chapters 5 and 6 discuss some cool tools including: p0f, amap, ettercap, xprobe2, metasploit, CANVAS, and IMACT.  Enough information is included to get you going on each one.  Also the underlying principles are discussed.  Good chapters.   Chapters 5 and 6 rate four stars.  <br /> <br />Chapters 7 through 11 discuss: Programming, Linux Exploits, Shell Code, and Windows Exploits.  The \\"Programming Survival Skills\\" chapter is a little light, but that can only be expected.  These chapters are very well done, and this is the best section of the book.  The explanations are very clear and concise.  I tried many of the examples in these chapters, and they worked flawlessly.  The authors attention to detail will make these chapters very valuable to those learning vulnerability research and discovery.  The material here provides a solid foundation.   Chapters 7 through 11 rate a strong five stars.  <br /> <br />Chapters 12 through 15 discuss reverse engineering, writing exploits, and patching the holes.  Tools discuss include valgrind, sharefuzz, SPIKE, IDA Pro, RATS, its4, debuggers, and more.  This is a nice introduction to reverse engineering.  It's enough toget you going, but it's not quite as deep as many will probably want.  The discussions here are well done.   Chapters 12 through 15 rate a weak five stars.   <br /> <br />Overall, I rated this book a strong four stars.  I would have loved to give it five stars if the first few chapters were better.  I wouldn't mind seeing them removed and replaced with expanded technical content in any future editions.  Based on the strengh of the remainder of this book, it's hard to imagine a better introduction to advanced vulnerability discovery techniques.  I wish I had this a few years ago!	2005-01-28

The depth of information here is unparalleled.  I continue to be impressed with the detail in this book.  Fenner and Rudoff have done an outstanding job of maintaining quality and tradition this invaluable reference.  Avid Stevens fans will not be disappointed.       3rd edition updates include:    *IPv6  added   *POSIX 1003.1-2001 added    *XTI dropped    *T/TCP dropped   *SCTP added   *Key Management Sockets for use with IPSec Added   *Machines used for examples updated  *Other material updated where appropriate (including new functions)     I bought this book a year ago along with Stevens \\"Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment\\"  I read most of this book as a tutorial on network programming.  I continue to use it as reference.  I also read all of APUE.  Since then I've added TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 and UNIX Network Programming, Volume 2 to my collection.  I've come to apprecaite the painstaking detail, pure clarity, and conciseness that are the hallmarks of all Stevens books.          I'm thankful that Rudoff and Fenner updated this classic.  This book is all most will need for the sockets API.  I don't have the second edition, but I'm quite happy with the third.  It's good to have something that speaks to IPv6.  This is the best of the old and new.  I wouldn't mind seeing an updated version of TCP/IP Illustrated volumes 1 and 2 either if Fenner and Rudoff are up to it.      All of the Stevens books compliment each other really well.  Truth be told, the more Stevens books you read the better off you are.	2005-01-28

The information it contains should be regarded as mandatory knowledge for those running nessus in a professional environment.  This book is about more than just nessus.  It is about an approach to network auditing and vulnerability assessment.    The first few chapters are largely introductory and cover vulnerability assessment and nessus basics.  The next few chapters cover more basics including running a scan, interpreting results, and vulnerability types.      The latter chapters cover areas of interest to an experienced nessus user.  The chapter on false positives begs to be read.  The authors offer a logical approach to dealing with false positives that most organizations lack.  The remaining chapters detail the inner workings of nessus (knowledge base, nasl, plugin writing), enterprise scanning, and the nessus user community.      This book provides a through explanation of the tool.  Enough information is given to start writing your own custom security checks.  However, I did find myself wanting for a little more technical substance (especially in the plug-in writing/nasl area), but maybe that's just me.  This book has a decent index that helps with reference.  This book will benefit the beginner and experienced user alike.	2005-01-06

The next two chapters (50 pages) serve as a tutorial on getting wireless cards, drivers, and utilities running on Linux.  The next five chapters cover attacks and tools.  Details of the attacks are covered in depth.  In some cases discussions reference latter chapters where the protocols are discussed in depth.  Each took is discussed enough to get the reader started.  After that, discovering the details of the tools is left as an exercise to the reader.   <br /> <br />The remaining 7 chapters cover defense (230 pages).  The authors approach though-out these sections is to explain the details of the protocols while discussing defensive techniques.  Two chapters on cryptography strive to strike a balance between explanations for crypto experts and explanations for those without much of a mathematical background.  It will take some work to fully understand these chapters because of the detail.  By the same measure, they will make a great reference for me.   <br /> <br />At 34.99 less Amazon discount, this book is a bargain.  It's easily a 50 or 60 dollar book when compared to others.  I paid full price for mine at Border's, because I couldn't wait to get into it.  For those who need a comprehensive understanding of 802.11a through 802.11i security, I can't think of anything better.  <br />	2005-01-05

I have really enjoyed it.  The author attempts to review all of science and philospophy from the sixth century BC to present day and odes a remarkable job of it.   <br /> <br />Here's the TOC: <br />1  Ancient Dialogs <br />2  Greek and Midieval Aristotelian Science <br />3  The Seventeenth-Century Revolution in Phisical Science <br />4  Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centrur Transformations in Metaphysics <br />5  Modern Views on scientific Method <br />6  Modern Transformations in Biology and Medicine <br />7  TheRefinement and Evolution of Mechanical Phisics <br />8  Science and Obsolence of Metaphysics and Religion <br />9  Social, Ethical, and Political Dimensions in Science and Technology <br />10  Some Twetieth-Century Developments in Physical Science <br />11  Twentieth-Century views on Scientific Method <br />12  Science and Philosophy at the Turn of the Millennium <br /> <br />This book documents the major advances in science and philosophy.  It has significant excerpts from the writings of all the major players including: Einstein, Freud, Mach, Aristotle, Dewey, Gallileo, Heisenberg, Henery David Thoreau, and many, many more.  The author provides insightful commentary and context to the cited excerpts.  It makes for an interesting and enlightening review of science and philosophy.   <br /> <br />While this book is enjoyable, it's not the easiest book in the world to read.  I had to look up several words, and I'd advise most reader's to keep a dictionary handy.  I would actually give this book about 4 1/2 stars on its own merit.  I'll round it up to 5 because I really enjoyed it as a gift.	2004-10-15

The authors accomplish this goal quite well with no room waasted.  The writing is concise, direct, and too the point.  The step-by-step style allows you to find the answers you need quickly and logically.  <br />While $39 is a bit pricy for a 123 page book, it is worth it.  The correct answers are here, and I found the format to be a timesaver.    Ths coverage of OpenSSH here is more complete than I've read anywhere else.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about OpenSSH.	2004-07-01

If you are looking for a book that describes the differences between differnt implementations of SSH and a some nifty management and deployment options then this may be for you.  You might condsider this book if you were deciding how to best deploy an SSH product in a large organization.    To quote the author, \\".... this book does not cover the ins and outs of SSH as a protocol...... Instead, it covers the ins and outs of implementing and optimizing SSH.\\"  Products covered include OpenSSH, OpenSSH(Win32), SSH from SSH Communications, VShell, Secure CRT, Putty, F-Secure, Mindterm, and WinSCP.    The author has substantial knowledge of the different SSH products.  The author describes some standard and not-so standard ways SSH can be used in an organization to get the job done.  This book is pretty easy to read and the information is useful.    On the downside, I would have liked to buy just one book for SSH.  I use OpenSSH.  Unfortunately this book didn't give me enough details to satisfy me.  I need to know how something works before I deploy it.  For OpenSSH, I recommend the SANS Press book on \\"OpenSSH\\" as a how to guide to fill the void.        I give this book 3 stars.	2004-07-01

This chapter is a good introduction to software vulnerabilities (which make up all CERT advisories) and why this book is relevant.    Chapter 2 - Attack Patterns  This chapter provides and overview of types of attacks.  It includes history of vulnerability types and predictions of future vulnerabilities.      Chapter 3 - Reverse Engineering and Program Understanding  This chapter begins with a good introduction to reverse engineering tools and techniquies.  It then zooms into writing plugins for the IDA disassembler along with batch analysis with IDA disassembler.  It also discusses writing your own cracking tools.      Chapter 4 - Exploiting Server Software  This chapter provides and over view of techniques for exploiting any server software.  It is filled with real examples and loads of fun.  Many attack patterns are covered in various levels of detail. Numerous tools are highlighted for finding injection points.      Chapter 5 - Exploiting Client Software  The logic of exploiting client software is different than exploiting server software, so there's and extra chapter.  Again the focus is on techniques to look for exploitable bugs.      Chapter 6 - Crafting (Malicious) Input  This chapter discusses many different methods for crafing input to locate bugs.  Many tools and professional techniques are highlighted.   I didn't know a lot of this stuff was out there.      Chapter 7 - Buffer Overflows  It starts with a high level overview of traditional buffer overflows, then some non tradiditional buffer overflows are discussed.  This chapter also covers format strings.  One of the longer chapters in the book, it highlighes a lot of problem areas.      Chapter 8 - Rootkits  One of the authors is the creator of the first rootkit for windows, and he details some of his techniques here.  Not only does he discuss root kit techniques, but he also discusses techniques that apply to malware in general.      On the positive side: The writing is enjoyable, and the technical concepts are explained clearly.  This is a good book for anyone interested in vulnerability research.   I found chapters 4-6 to be the best.     This book has a decent index.  I've used it for reference a couple of times since I finished reading it which is always a measure of a worthwhile book.      On the downside, I have a few minor complaints:  Some of the tools mentioned in the book were no where to be found.  Many were named without references, and Google searches revealed little about them or how to find them.  Another tool was supposed to be available at one of the authors website, but I couldn't find it.  The authors cover some material at a high level while other material is covered in depth without any apparent reason for the disparity.      A good book for those interested in vulnerabiltiy research and software security.  I also suggest the sister book \\"Building Secure Software\\" to compliment this one.	2004-04-14

It provides a thorough introduction to the field.  I discovered a lot of useful tid-bits and techniques throughout the book.  For example, I just didn't know you could customize your gdb sessions by using macros in a .gdbinit file.  <br />Part 2 covers network stalking.  At first glance I though I might skip this section, because I'm familiar with the concepts.  I'm glad I didn't, because there's nothing stale here.  I picked up a few useful tidbits of information in each chapter that I didn't know.<br />Part 3 covers platform attacks.  Familiar ground for most of this books target audience, but there was much fresh information in here.  It's as if the authors have read the same books as the rest of us and specifically chosen to research and expand upon areas that were left out of those books.  <br />Part 4 covers advanced defense.  This part of the book is very useful.  Log file aggregation, IDS, honeypots, and forensics techniques are some of the more significant discussions.  I found the case study on setting up SNORT with ACID particularly helpful.  <br />I can't think of a better way to describe it than the authors did in the preface, &quot;ratchet your level of knowledge upward by a few notches.&quot;  Folks in the trenches will find this quite helpful and enjoyable to read.	2004-04-10

The wizards from bugtraq have shared a significant portion of their craft and tools with us in this book.  For that, I am most grateful.  Given the technical prowess of many of the authors, I was pleasantly supprised by their willingness and ability to explain concepts in very detailed, clear, and concise manner.      After spending some time with this book, I became somewhat disappointed by the number of errors it contains.  A few solid technical reviewers could have easily caught these errors and made the end product much better.  Another disappoint is that all of the stuff that the book promises at the website still hasn't appeared.      This book is not for beginners.  This book assumes reasonable competence with C, Assemply, and computer architecture... all at an intermediate level.      This book stands out for the info it provides.  Other books have tease and hint at some of these concepts for maybe a sentence or two, but they never truly explain any of them.  It's rare to find explanations of this material.  There is no fluff and no confusion (except for errors in the examples).  This is well done, and a joy to read.  It is the definitivie text book for students of vulnerability discovery.	2004-04-10

I heard this book was by the smart guys that wrote the language, and I was going to get it straight from the source.  I had one problem though; I couldn't handle the info.  At that time I got discouraged 1/3 of the way through the introductory chapter and put it down.  I didn't pick it up again until a couple of weeks ago.  <br />Having since read another introductory text on C, I can understand this book now.  Now that I can understand it, I enjoy and appreciate the elegant clarity of the concise writing style.  It's a great second or third book on C.  It provides the foundations necessary to advance to the intermediate programming level and beyond.  <br />This book is very condensed.  Although it's short, it's not a book most of us will read very fast.  It's quite different from most modern books on programming.  Still, it's quite digestible if you've had a good introduction to C and programming in general.  For me, this book filled in all the nagging little questions left by other introductory books.  The index is excellent and useful.  I cannot overstate how much a good index is worth in a book like this.  Appendix A, which is a reference manual for the language is also excellent.    <br />Although the book is dated, its effectiveness is not hindered by time.  It covers the language backwards and forewards with absolute clarity.  If you really want to know C, I suggest picking up this book after an introductory text.  I know that the information in this book will save me from hours of frustrating beginner mistakes.  I think I'm ready to move on to Stevens now.	2004-03-16

I'm a novice in this area and this is the first book I read on the subject.  On my first reading, I was only able to fully comprehend about 80% of this introduction to a most facinating subject matter.  I must say that I enjoyed reading about all of it including the 20% I couldn't fully comprehend.  The authors claim that no advanced math is necessary, but knowledge of differential calculus would help with the Shrodinger Equation.  Perhaps my weakness in math (which I will soon address) accounts for the 20% I don't really understand at this point.  <br />This book has plenty of beautiful pictures and illustrations of the technologies and experiements discussed.

US	49393940	R3EFXSSYKA5GY6	0131014056	542136605	Malware: Fighting Malicious Code	Books	5	13	14	N	N	best of it's kind	I've read a few books on viruses, worms, and malware.  This is the best by far.  Prior to reading this text I considered myself pretty well versed in the subject area of all but a couple of chapters.  I was pleasantly suprised to uncover a ton of new knowledge, tools, and tricks in each chapter.  Now that I've finished reading this book, my only regret is that the experience is over.<br />The 12 chapters of this book include the following major topics:  Viruses, Worms, Malicious Mobile Code, Backdoors, Trojan Horses, User Mode RootKits, Kernel-Mode RootKits, Going Deeper, Scenarios, and Malware Analysis.  At first glance this all seems like pretty standard fare.  However, Skoudis really digs into each subject.  He includes in-depth analysis of many live and current malware specimines.  I even learned a lot of not so well documented things about Unix and Windows from this book.<br />Ed is able to explain complex technical material in a way that's easy to digest and enjoyable to the reader.  While it's written more for a techie, this book can also be read and appreciated by a novice.  <br />The chapters on Malicious Mobile Code and RootKits were particularly enlighning.  The chapter entitled &quot;Going Deeper&quot; explores possibilities for malware at the BIOS and CPU microcode levels in addition to combo-malware.  The chapter on &quot;Malware Analysis&quot; is a nice intorduction to revers engineering and analyzing malware.   <br />I attended a SANS track instructed by the the author recently.  I told him how much I enjoyed reading &quot;Counter Hack&quot; a couple of years back.  He said that &quot;Counter Hack&quot; was like an InfoSec 101/102 course and &quot;Malware&quot; is like InfoSec 103/104.  I agree that this is a great follow &quot;Counter Hack&quot;.  This is not a rerun or revision of the first book.  Nor is it the same exact material he teaches with SANS (which is also very good stuff).  Malware is a new and fresh book that will sit on the top shelf of my InofSec bookcase with the other books that I refer to frequently.  This book easily earns my highest rating and recommendation.	2004-03-09

Where are the vulnerabilites?  Think about that question... They are in the software!  This is an area of security that is not adressed often enough.  I consider this book essential reading for anyone in the IT security arena.  This is the first book of its kind.    The first 6 chapters can be read and understood by programmers and managment alike.  The first 6 chapters should be required reading for any security professional or manager.  They discuss software engineering and how vulnerabilities creep into the software.      The remainder of the book is geared towards secure coding technques.  The techniques discussed can be applied to any language and many are discussed.  Much is geared towards C however.  There are sections on inherently vulnerable functions and input validation.  Also of interest are sections on the implementation of PRNG and crypto.      All of the helpful code samples are available at the book's web site.  This 2-year old text will be relevant for years to come.  It will be a security classic.  It's enjoyable to read overall, but I found it a bit dry in a couple of spots.  I really rates about 4 and a half stars.  I read it cover to cover and enjoyed it.  Unlike many modern security books, I've found this one incredibly useful as a reference  since reading it.	2004-02-28

I couldn't put it down, and I finished it in about two days.  <br />About a true life story, this book just makes you want to play.  There are some really funny momments in the books with some of the characters.  Eventhough I'll probably never play that good, it just made me want to play.  <br />If you're looking for a really fun read that will revitalize your interest in the game this is the one.	2004-02-28
US	49393940	RKBIWBGWM8Q2L	0967808952	968538681	Dirty Pool: Playing to Win	Books	2	1	1	N	N	a little light	The author does not get into enough detail for me to be of very much help.  If you know the concept of safety play, then you basically know what this book is all about.  <br />The author does discuss selecting high percentage shots and practice.  Without practice, unforunately, there are times when neither a high percentage shot or high percentage \\"dirty\\" play are available execpt for all but the best players.  <br />It's not badly written, and it does have a few witty comments.  If you read it you might pick up a few useful tips.  I was disappointed with this book, but maybe I expected too much.  If you like to keep things simple, you might like this book.	2004-02-28

This is the best single text, and it is my favorite of the lot.  It discusses nearly every facit of the game in no nonesense terms.  You will learn in &quot;matter of fact&quot; terms why you miss shots, which shots have the largest margin of error, how to allow for error, and much more.  <br />Everything from basic technique to banking and kicking systems is discussed.  This book can be easily understood by the layman.  Pool players can be a superstitious bunch.  It's hard to get a good player to explain exactly what has to happen in order to make a shot.  If you want to take the &quot;voo-doo&quot; out of pool and shot making, then this book is for you.  I highly recommend it to all pool players.	2004-02-28

A very entertaining read, this book gives the reader perspective on how things were 15-65 years ago while telling this great hustler's life story.  It covers how he got started in the game as a boy and continues up through and beyond married life.  Both the highs and lows of this pool hustler's life are told in an intersting way.<br />This book is a good pool story that's well written by a pool player for pool players.  Reading stories like this makes me want to be a better pool player.  It certainly provides a some motivation to go practice.	2004-02-28
US	49393940	RIGNN7JLWJF1Z	0471375233	304838115	Assembly Language Step-by-step: Programming with DOS and Linux (with CD-ROM)	Books	5	20	22	N	N	Good Intro	This book filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge about computers in general as well as introducing me to the world of assembly language.  I didn't know how much I didn't know until I read this text.  <br />The book is enjoyable and easy to read.  If I had it to do over again, this is probably the first computer programming book I would read.  The author really explains the concepts in simple terms that are easy for even a novice to understand.  I found parts of the book moving along a bit slowly for my taste, but I was certainly able to reatin all the knowlege.  <br />The first 150-200 pages is mostly background.  I found some useful morsels of information through these sections, although I was able to read through them quite quickly.  Then there's about 200 pages on assembling for DOS and another 120 pages on assembling for LINUX.  All parts of the book are relevant to each other.    <br />If you are new to assembly, or want to fill in some gaps in you knowlege this is a great book to start with.  If you have programmed in assembly before, you will probably be disappointed with this book.	2004-02-27

I only gave this book 4 stars although it really deserves more, because it may not live up to the expectations of some readers.<br />Only the Bourne shell is covered, because it's the most portable.  It covers all the basics and many advanced issues.  The authors philosphy is to teach by example, and this book is full of examples and sample code.  <br />The first half of the book is a down and dirty &quot;How To by Example.&quot;  The examples are general enough and well enough documented that the use for the syntaxes described remains clear in the readers mind.  The second half of the book contains some sample shell utilities.  These are shell programs that were written to mimmick or epxpand on functionality of common UNIX commands.  I found the first half of the book to be the most useful over time.<br />Some explanations may be a bit terse for brand new shell prgrammers.  Awk is covered in much detail at all, although there are some very nice examples of using sed.  All in all this is the best shell programming reference I've seen.	2004-02-27
US	49393940	R4M8VVEQO87N0	1593270070	198606865	Hacking: The Art of Exploitation w/CD	Books	5	154	162	N	N	One of a Kind	This book is for the security pro or would be hacker who want's to begin to see how deep the rabbit hole really does go.  There is no other book like it on the market, and I've read most of them.  Jon Erickson's code included in the book all works well as designed on Linux.  The author also suggests some good free Linux tools for use with the code examples including most notably a hex editor, basic dissassembler, and packet injector.<br />The techniques in the book are best described by a caption on its back cover, \\"The fundamental techniques of serious hacking.\\"  It includes major sections on programming, networking, and cryptography.  All material is covered with an eye towards exploitation.  Languages used in the book material consist of C, PERL, and Assembly for X86.  <br />The techniques described in this book are fundamental to any hacker or security professional who takes their work seriously.  The book is well worth the discounted amazon.com price.  The material in this book is all original and cannot be found elsewhere.  Each example in the programming section is truly an eye opener if you are new to code hacking.  The examples in the networking and cryptography sections are relevant and fresh as well.	2004-01-10
US	49393940	R35RFVYDQO353W	0672324555	791371924	Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days, Professional Reference Edition (3rd Edition)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Good Start	I read two other books on Java while preparing for the SCJP.  The problem I had with the SCJP books, is that I felt like I still didn't know Java after I read them.  This book filled in that gap for me.  I wish I had started with this one, because it assumes that you will  be writing some progams in Java other than just taking an exam.  <br />This book is broken into 3 primary sections.  The first 7 chapters cover the basics including Java concepts, object oriented programming concepts, basic Java, objects, classes, methods, and applets.  These chapters provide a good introduction to Java and serve as a foundation for the remaining chapters.  <br />The next 7 chapters primarily cover visual java and programming with Swing including components, containers, user interfaces, and graphics.  Threads and sound are also coverd.  <br />The next 7 chapters introduce more advanced (actually intermediate) topics including packages and class features, error handling, streams, object serialization, sockets, JavaBeans, and database connectivity.<br />The appendicies on configuring the Software Development Kit (SDK) is very helpful to a new programer.  There is a good amount of sample code that all runs as designed and compiles without error.  The sample code very helpful for grasping the concepts as they are presented.<br />This book is what it was written to be.  It's a solid introduction to Java.  It does not cover advanced Java, but it does cover enough to get you started.  Those who intend to use Java as a primary programming language would will want to augment this introductory text with other books after these concepts are mastered.	2003-10-30

I have several books on C and several on other languages I would trade them all for this.  It covers the basics (essentials) that other books written exclusively for one language don't even touch on.  I explains how all of the languages covered interplay with UNIX/LINUX.  <br />The first chapter covers programs, the C compiler, header files, staic libraries, and shared libraries.  It explains they all come together to make a program in a way that it can be understood<br />The second chapter covers UNIX shell scripts at length.  I have good book on shell scripts, and this chapter alone is just as good as that book.  <br />The third chapter covers working with UNIX files, system calls, library functions etc...  The sample programs all work as they are supposed to.  Everything is clearly explained and easily understood.  <br />The 4th chapter covers passing arguments to C programs, envorment variables, temporary files, configuring logs, and system resources.  <br />I have not read any further, because I've only had this book a week.  I've been looking for a book like this for a few years.  It talks about how C and other languages interface with LINUX/UNIX rather than just giving you the pure language and leaving you to fend for yourself.  <br />Other chapters include:<BR>5) Terminals<BR>6) Curses<BR>7) Data Management<BR>8) Development Tools<BR>9) Debugging<BR>10) Processes and Signals<BR>11) POSIX Threads<br />12) Inter-process Communication: Pipes<BR>13) Semaphores, Mesage Queues, and Shared Memory,<BR>14) Socets<BR>15) TCL: Tool Command Language<BR>16) Programming for X<BR>17) Programming for GNOME using GTK+<BR>18) The Perl Programming Language<BR>19) Programming for the Internet: HTML<BR>20) Internet Programming 2: CGI<BR>21) Device Drivers<BR>Appendex A) Portability<BR>Appendex B) FSF and the GNU Project<BR>Appendex C) Internet Resources<BR>Appendex D) Bibliography<br />Ifyou are only get one book on programming, this is the one you need.  I have at least 8 other books on various programming languages, and this one is better than all of them combined.  This book is 900 pages packed full information, and it's easily understood.  The sample programs all work and are well documented.<br />I write this review after reading only four chapters, because the information I have gotten out of them is worth way more than the price of this book.  This book gives you all the pieces to the puzzles and tells you how to put it together.  This book can be used by advanced programmers as well to fill in any knowlege gaps they may have.  This book gets my highest recommendation, as it will be by my side for years to come.	2003-10-30

These days I find myself reading computer books almost exclusively with most of them having to do with security.  This book remindinded me of the days when I used to just read for pleasure.  <br />Hiding in Plain Sight is very well written and fun to read.  It's one of those books you look forward to reading every time you pick it up.  It's written in such a way that the information in the books stays with you long after you read it.  It provides a good introduction to cryptography and steganography.  The book also comes with a CD with some sample stego tools on it.  You can have a lot of fun playing with these.<br />The book is not an all encompasing steganography book.  It does have about the right amount of technical information for most security professionals.  If you are a security professional and are looking for something fun to read that will enhance your understanding of steganography and cryptography you will not be disappointed with this book.	2003-06-14
