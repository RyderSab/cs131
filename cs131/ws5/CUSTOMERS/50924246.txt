Poldarn has decided that he does not wish to remember his past, as what hints he has gotten are all pretty appalling.  Alas, his past is not so eager to forget about him.    For myself, I found \\"Memory\\" to be far too similar to the first book in this series, \\"Shadow\\".  The prose is more polished and the metafores more subtle, but otherwise the content is just more of the same.    If you've not read another book in this series, you'll greatly enjoy this work -- 5 stars.  Otherwise, while pleasant, \\"Memory\\" offers nothing new.	2005-10-13

This SciFi novel presumes space travel that requires extensive time (many years) and cryogenics.  The colonists arrive somewhat before the book starts, discover the planet at which they have arrived is already inhabited, and send back a request for help.  Well, help finally arrives, long after it ceases to be needed.  But the \\"help\\" have goals of their own, which do not always coicide with the colonists desires.    I have three problems with this book, and it lost one star for each.  First, \\"City of Pearl\\" switches between three primary viewpoints, which writing strategy I seldom enjoy.  Second, the book takes a very strong stance against eating meat -- this isn't necessary to the plot in any way, the author just seems to abhor people who admit they are omnivores.  Third, the plotline depicts government, big business and humans in general as predominately being selfish and evil; wheras the colonists and aliens were predominately generous and good.      Personally, I found the above obnoxious and was unable to enjoy the rest of the book.  This is a shame, because \\"City of Pearl\\" has quite a lot to offer.  This is a creative SciFi novel with intriguing societal rules, and interesting metaphores comparing pregancy and/or abortion with ... well, you'll see.    \\"City of Pearl\\" is well written and creative.  Karen Traviss is a skilled author, and I look forward to reading another of her novels.	2005-10-13

The action focuses on women who are acquiring magic.  Men are loosing their magic, and this shift of power is causing societal changes.  The action is fragmented between the points of view of many different people who have nothing in common until well into the novel.  The women's names were unusual but not any more confusing than most SF/Fantasy novels, due to the current trend among publishers to demand cryptic character names.    For myself, I didn't enjoy this book.  The main focus was whining about how poorly men treat women.  This constant complaining got old, fast - poor me, poor me, poor me.  Yick.  Also, there are simply too many point-of-view changes.  The book just doesn't seem to go anywhere, because so much time is spent introducing yet another woman who blames all of her problems on some man, or yet another man who is responding poorly to change.    To be fair, much of this book was well done.  Some of the characters were quite interesting, such as a poor widow, the king, and the first female mage apprentice.  In my opinion, these excelent characterizations did not adequately compensate for the weak plot.	2005-10-03

The plot is a fantasy adventure, with a romantic sub-plot.  The romantic plot takes a decided back-burner to L's adventure.

The Scottish Highlands are being invaded by a thoroughly nasty group of barbarians, who are intent on genocide.  The action mostly follows C, a lighthearted middle aged warrior; and G, his adopted son, survivor of a barbarian massacre.  The book opens with the barbarians leveling G's home city, concentrates on G growing to adulthood with C, and then moves to the highlanders' response to the eventual barbarian invasion.  Other focal characters include S, a queen from the future, and T, a druid who can move and see through time.  T. searches through possible timelines, in a desperate attempt to find a course of events that will defeat the barbarians.  The point of view jumps quite a bit between C, G, the druids and the barbarians.  The time travel interplay is intriguing.     S's and the druids' involvement is unnecessarily convoluted and confusing.  The rules of time travel are not clearly defined, which occasionally ruined the flow of the story for me.  Too, although the barbarians have conquered the Scottish Lowlands, the barbarians inhabiting that land are simply ignored.  Having studied many old battles and invasions, I found this quite unlikely and thus obnoxious.    Though nicely performed and polished, I found this novel did not inspire me.	2005-10-03

A vampire disappears and S. is obliged to use her rare telepathic ability to investigate.  The storyline is fast paced and lively, focused on S and her frequent forays into peril.  Plot elements include racist attacks against vampires, but it is rather hard not to sympathize with the attackers, since vampires are shown to mistreat and murder people.   <br /> <br />I've two main problems with this book.  First, everyone engages in casual sex, and this is a frequent topic of conversation. Rather like prime time TV, no one is allowed to be happily married.  The author gives lip service to marriage as a desirable institution, but no married couples exist - well, okay, two of the nastiest people in the book are a married couple, but they hardly count as a positive role model for marriage. I can't even identify a fully committed serially monogamous couple.  Second, the villains are seriously under powered when compared to the vampires whom they threaten.  This brings into question S's involvement occasionally, but that flaw is easily overlooked in the midst of the excitement. <br />	2005-10-03

Don't let the lengthy time daunt you though -- the time required shrinks after a few weeks, and the relief is well worth it.  The 5-minute stretches are helpful, too.  The reviewers who didn't like this book all sound like they never actually tried the E-cises. <br /> <br />I'd give this book 5-stars, but I must in honesty admit that Egoscue's book \\"Pain Free\\" is superior.	2005-09-20

The two of them live in remote mountains, studying, until the king calls upon the Truthsayer to, well, say if someone is telling the truth.  <br /> <br />One group of people kill the Truthsayer and steal the magical robe that gives him his powers.  Dalin pursues, both to recover the robe and avenge his master's murder.  He quickly falls in with a second group who also want the Truthsayer's Robe.  Along their journey to recover the Robe, Dalin learns about his magical powers, and learns what it takes to be the Truthsayer. <br /> <br />Unlike the other reviewers, I think this book has only one main problem.  The second group (elves mainly) adamently refuse to tell Dalin WHY they want the Robe.  There really isn't any reason for this refusal; it just makes them all seem like selfish, rude bullies.  By the very last chapter of the book, Dalin and the reader are STILL ignorant of why this second group want the robe and why they think Dalin should give it to them.  This is stupid and very annoying.	2005-09-12

The setting is an alternate current day, where vampires have newly become legally recognized citizens.  Sookie is enamoured of the first vampire she meets -- she cannot read his thoughts, which is simply wonderful.  While dating this vampire, Sookie learns more than she wanted to know about vampires. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book.  The first one-third was well written and quite enjoyable -- 5-stars.  The rest of the book was a disapointment.  Scarcely a page goes by without some reference to someone having casual sex with a complete stranger.  Some of the sex is quite explicit.  Sookie is a bit more reserved than this, but not by much.  Monogomy, committment and marraige are scarce and not considered to be particularly desirable.  Also, the main plotline explores racism.  Mostly, this is racism between humans and vampires, but plenty is between Caucasians & African Americans.  Though thoughtfully executed, this makes for a rather uncomfortable book -- think \\"The Color Purple\\" or \\"Kiss of the Spider Woman\\" -- and that isn't the mood I want out of a fantasy novel.	2005-09-12

The escaped ringleader will likely seek vengence on them, so they also worry that the daughter (left with relatives) will be attacked. Upon reaching their farm, the family discovers that Tier is suffering severe magical damage and will shortly die without help. While deciding what to do, Phoran (their king) shows up incognito, in desparate need of help. Roughly speaking, this book enumerates the continuing adventures of the same people who appeared in the first book.     The first half is wonderfully written and highly entertaining -- nothing new, but fun nonetheless. The second half of the book was a disapointment. The second half relied too much on gods and powerful allies and too little on wit -- what I've liked best about Briggs' other books is how the characters make clever use of their assets to defeat foes.  Briggs reveals new information that in essence changes everything we know of magic & Travelers & the Shadowed. I my opinion, these events & all did not fit well with the mood and setting of the previous book.  To be fair, the other reviewers enjoyed these revelations.    If you enjoyed Brigg's previous book, you'll get your money's worth. Lively entertainment, fast paced and enjoyable, well suited to pass a lazy afternoon or long airplane ride.	2005-08-23

The main character is a middle aged man, married with two children, who works as a cooper (barrel maker).  He is emontionally distant, hard working, and entirely convinced that he knows what is right.  He is oblivious to politics, current events, and the subtleties of peoples' reactions.  The beginning portion of this book is a well executed tragedy in the Greek sense -- bad things happen to a good man, through no fault of his own.  His personality is well defined and quite interesting, particularly since he is so different from Modesitt's other characters.    After this marvelous beginning, alas, the author appears to have no idea where to go.  Most of the book wanders without focus.  The location changes throughout the book, and describes what has happened to lands last seen decades or centuries before in previous books.  Occasionally, people wander up to our hero and utter mystic messages.  Lots of pages are devoted to carpentry and eating and musing about justice.  This book has no real plot, but rather wanders pleasantly hither and yon.     Eventually, the book jumps gears, and the main character's personality changes.  He starts observing everything, questioning everything, learning magic, and being more proactive.  The quest for justice fades into the background.  I found these changes incongruous, but perhaps you will not.    My overall impression was that \\"Wellspring of Chaos\\" would have made a marvelous short story.	2005-08-22

If you are vacaationing in Montreal with Kids, DON'T use public transportation.  The bus & subway are great, no problem there, but you'll have to cross a lot of roads on foot, and the drivers are none too careful.  Crossing a Montreal street on foot is an act of courage.  My daughter & I were almost killed twice when crossing roads.  Rent a car!    \\"Fodor's Around Montreal with Kids\\" lists 68 different attractions around Montreal intended to appeal to children in particular.  Each attraction is described on two pages, along with address, price, hours, nearby food, interesting tid-bits, and sometimes caveats.  The layout is quite nice.      The biggest problem with this guide is that the author does not appear to have ever set foot in Montreal.  This leads to some pretty obvious problems in the guide.  For example, if you buy tickets to the Insectarium, you'll also be buying tickets to the Botanic Gardens -- no choice, it is inside the garden grounds -- and if you also buy tickets to the Biodome at the same time, you'll save some money and can go to the Biodome (or Gardens/Insectarium) another day.  The Stewart meuseum (which is well worth seeing) is too far from the Metro to walk -- about a mile -- but this guide fails to mention that.  The archeology & history meuseum recommended in Old Montreal has nothing that will appeal to kids except for the free movie at the beginning.  The Old Montreal horse drawn carraige ride tours and four-person car-shaped bikes are incredibly fun but not mentioned in the list of activities available near the piers of Old Montreal.  And the most fun activity we found was next to the stop Jean Depraeu on the way to the Stewart Meseum -- a giant a fountain for kids to play in for free -- and anyone who walked past going from the underground stop (recommended) to the Aquadome would have to be blind not to notice this attraction, but it is also not mentioned.  Finally, we never could find the trapping meseum (fell of the map, I suppose).    Overall, a nice guide, but call everywhere first.  I highly recommend the Botanic Gardens -- admission includes multiple museums of interest to kids & adults, as well as fantastic Japaneese and Chineese gardens.      And RENT A CAR!	2005-08-22

The author's message is simple and endearing -- build on your strengths, avoid your weak areas.   <br /> <br />As other reviewers metion, much of this book focuses on a second message, \\"pay $20 to use our web tool to find out your strengths.\\"  Personally, I found the underlying message that you can't figure out your own strengths without their expensive assistance to be pretty annoying.  There was also a strongly stated message that you can't possibly fix your weak areas so don't even try.  Poppycock!  Don't believe this!  Also, the audio tape often mentions that the authors have compiled a list of 35 (34?) basic strengths, and never gets around to telling us what they are -- presumably, you have to pay the $20 for a new book and take the web survey to find out.  And, finally, the pace of the audio tape is really slow.  An hour & a half of \\"figure out your strengths and build on them\\" is about an hour more than was needed. <br /> <br />So, if you are interested, I suggest you buy it in book form, new not used.

The leading lady is forthright and confident without being overbearing; and the leading man is everything you could want.  I enjoyed this book enough to read it over again, but I must admit the ending is somewhat less inspired than rest -- too much action and drama where a more subdued setting would have suited better.

Briggs takes a slew of nasty topics -- murder, torture, rape, slavery --  yet avoids dropping the reader into despair or depression.  This novel is enjoyable, lively and mainly light hearted, despite the weighty topics.  The common fantasy/sci-fi flaws are all avoided -- point of view hopping is kept to a minimum, characters behave in a consistent manner, and we aren't hit over the head with an author's message.     \\"Steal the Dragon\\" is less polished than Briggs' later works, and lacks that extra spark that makes a 5-star book.

On the surface, all appears ordinary; but mages and shapeshifters and psychic talents abound.    The story starts with Dela, a blond lady who is resolute, decisive and independent.  Dela has psychic powers relating to metal, which among other things lets her read the history of metal objects.  Dela is shopping in a Beijing market, where she purchases a puzzle box for an absurdly low price.  A man watches the purchase and assaults her; Dela elicits aid from people nearby and escapes.  Back in her hotel room, Dela opens the puzzle box and, in a flash of light, an exotic man appears.  Amidst confusion and presumptions, Dela learns that the man (Huri) is now her slave, that Huri must obey her commands until she either dies or shuts him up in the puzzle box again, that Huri cannot leave her side, and that Huri cannot be killed.  Dela promises to never issue him commands and vows to help him break this horrid curse.  Dela orders room service for Huri, and instead gets an assasin.  The plot continues along these lines.    \\"Tiger Eye\\" is a rousing tale of adventure.  The prose is well written and captivating.  My problem with this novel is the emotional plot.  Huri arrives angry at the world in general and Dela (his new master) in particular.  Although the author quickly establishes the beginnings of passion and sympathy between Huri and Dela, the main emotional mood is anger and defensiveness, \\"poor me I've been abused\\" sulking and \\"how can I trust her\\" fretting.  Although I greatly enjoy Romance novels, I find this particular meta-plot repulsive.  Additionally, I found Dela a bit too brash, too \\"I need to be in charge\\" pushy.  I know this is the current trend in Romance, but I cannot like it.    If those faults do not bother you, I expect you will enjoy this book greatly.  \\"Tiger Eye\\" provides lively entertainment with plenty of action and surprise twists.	2005-07-18

The wounded stranger turns out to be a princess. One of her sister princesses comes to find her, accompanied by a dozen or so guards (female, of course). Jerid hides in the kitchen and makes dinner for everyone, then goes to bed. Later that night, Jerid goes to the kitchen for a snack, meets one of the princesses, and turns all giggly. The plot continues along these lines -- mellodramatic & stereotypical.<br /><br />As entertainment, I found \\"A Brother's Price\\" rather dull. The author simply has the men all act like vapid ladies; has the women act like male chauvinists; substitutes each woman with a group of women; and has the society systematically subjugate men in every way imaginable. This might make for an insightful social commentary, but it makes for quite the dull fantasy novel. I expected the author to develop an imaginative world quite different from our own, but alas no.  I also found the society rather insulting to women.<br /><br />To be fair, Spencer crafts pretty good dialog, and the writing style is easy to read.  The characters don't have much depth but are internally consistent.  The society has a few intersting touches, most stemming from sisters staying together their whole lives.

Several sub-plots add lively interest: a plot to overthrow the king, a shady local's plots to thwart the law, and a young man's striving to change his life.  A fascinating and unique magic system adds creative interest:  at puberty, the valley people develop magical talents sympathetic to one of the five elements.  These elements are also expressed as magical creatures that roam wild.    The author did a good job of developping unique and interesting personalites for the main characters.  The writing style and descriptions are well done.  My only real problem is that this book is fragmented, split too many ways among too many characters:  a young man, his aunt, his uncle, a government agent, and a spy.  Butcher handles this better than most authors.  Still, each time the book changed point-of-view, I was reminded that I was reading a story and thrown out of flow.  Sometimes the new point-of-view could recapture my attention, but alas sometimes it could not.      Lively entertainment, I would say, suitable for to lift your mood and enliven your afternoon.	2005-07-12
US	50924246	RNPE7I11ZHXV6	0553587501	894969734	Hammered	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Promising New Author	I adore discovering a new author and reading their first book. These first books are inventive, carefully written, and unique. Mrs. Bear's first book is all of that and more, and I'm delighted to see that she has more coming.  <br /> <br />\\"Hammered\\" is a pure Science Fiction novel that takes place in Canada & USA, a few decades in the future.  Probably the most important changes between now and then is a general \\"I don't care\\" attitude -- the ideals of freedom, liberty, and charity have all pretty much disappeared.  Big business moved into the void and now control governmental functions with a rather \\"benign neglect\\" attitude -- they won't help anyone, but won't go out of their way to hurt anyone, either.  Everyone complains, but they don't care enough to actually do anything. <br /> <br />The plotline is fragmented and thus difficult to describe.  The back cover takes the easy way out of describing one of the 5 or 6 plotlines and claiming that is the focus of the book.  It isn't.  That plotline follows a middle aged, retired soldier.  Early in her military career, she lost limbs and vital organs in an explosion, and had them replaced with cybernetic parts.  She has adapted better than most to these cybernetic parts, which is to say that she keeps her drug adictions to a minimum.  Her boyfriend is a tough gang leader with sharp metalic teeth.  Another plotline follows a middle aged researcher who was in jail for decades for mysterious reasons.  Another plotline follows a terminally ill single dad and his two teenaged daughters.   <br /> <br />About the first third of \\"Hammered\\" is devoted to introducing these and other characters.  At this point, nothing has really happened yet, and the separate point-of-view plotlines don't appear to have anything in common.  Looking back at the book, all I can really say is that \\"Hammered\\" mainly explores this future world.  Be warned, \\"Hammered\\" is not a stand alone book! The plotlines do not draw to a conclusion at the end of the novel, do not even climax, but rather are still building. The sequel is being published, so no worries there.  <br /> <br />There are many readers out there who enjoy this writing style -- multiple viewpoints & multiple books -- and to you I warmly recommend \\"Hammered\\" as perhaps a 5-star book. For myself and others who abhor this style, this is an enjoyable peek into an inventive futuristic world.	2005-07-06

Edward has been told repeatedly how stupid he is.  After hiding out and doing basically nothing for many years, Edward comes out of seclusion and lands in a complicated mess of political intregue.  As the plot develops, Edward comes to question everything he knows about himself and his family. <br /> <br />This book is pure Science Fiction, and takes place in the far future, with planet hopping star ships and alien races.   <br />\\"Hunted\\" is in the same universe as \\"Vigilant\\" but avoids all of that other books problems -- no soap box sermons.  The whole story is from Edward's point of view, and holds together in an entertaining and cohesive whole.

First, the applicant must swear allegence to the Guild.  Then the Guild Mages trigger the applicant's dormant magical powers.     \\"The Magicians' Guild\\" follows the struggles of girl born to poverty who develops a strong magical talent without assistance -- right in front of a hostile group of Guild mages.  The plot focuses on the young girl's efforts to avoid the Guild; and the Guild's internal conflicts surrounding this unique event.  The more usual learning of magic plotline is rather subdued.      So much for the plot, now for the writing style.  The point of view changes between a thief, the young girl, and two Guild mages.  If you love melodrama, you will adore this book -- emotive overreactions, and vilifiying everyone with whom you disagree -- think Robin D. Owens or Mercedes Lackeys.  There is a rather heavy handed author's message maligning \\"the rich\\" which got old fast.  Also, the middle of the book drags a bit.  My two-star rating is heavily influenced by not liking any these elements of style.      \\"The Magicians' Guild\\" tells an entertaining tale, suitable for light entertainment.	2005-06-21

The book is nicely laid out with an interspersing of jokes and exercises, but so far the actual riddles that you've got a chance at figuring out are pretty few and far between.

Ista lost most of the middle of her life to maddness.  She is angry at the gods, and desperately wants to do something different with her life.  Ista sets out on a pilgramage, which is really more of a vacation, and becomes side tracked by the god's designs for her life. <br /> <br />\\"Paladin of Souls\\" is sort of but not really a sequel to \\"Curse of Chalion\\".  The plot has little in common, no worries there.  However, \\"Curse of Chalion\\" provides background into Ista and her past that is entirely missing from \\"Paladin of Souls.\\"  Without reading them in order, it is rather difficult to understand Ista, her motivations and her problems.  In fact, I read these two books out of order and \\"Paladin of Souls\\" just seemed to wander pointlessly.  Going back and reading the two in order brought Ista and her troubles into focus, improving this book's quality dramatically.  <br /> <br />Light entertainment, I would say, suitable to pass the time.  \\"Paladin of Souls\\" lacks that extra spark that made \\"Curse of Chalion\\" great, yet I enjoyed it all the same.	2005-06-09

Most of the information is on lighting, but I'd never realized how important and complicated lighting could be.  This book also covers some related topics for creating good looking video -- though I haven't gotten to those yet.  The author has a lot of relevant technical expertise, and does a very good job of conveying that knowledge.  No previous experience is required, but I wouldn't call this a beginner's book -- the depth of technical knowledge conveyed is impressive.  This is a third edition, which tells you that \\"Lighting for TV and Film\\" has sold well over many decades.	2005-05-31

The focus of this book is to encourage the reader to broaden their horizons on the topic of what to paint.  Guidance on technique is very thin -- almost nonexistent -- and this is fine, as there are many other books out there on this topic.  Rather, the author focuses on the process of creative interpretation:  discover what you like to paint, what that means to you, how to express your feelings visually, and so forth.  There is a lot in this book on using introspection to develop topics for art.  Each chapter begins (about 1/2 content) with the author's thoughts on the topic -- say, what fruit means to her, and how she brings that out in art -- and then suggests approaches & loosely worded projects you might use.<br /><br />If you enjoy self examination, you will probably adore this watercolor book's fresh aproach.  For myself, I just didn't get it.	2005-05-20

The author presents his experiences over several years in an art consortium, which specializes in providing artists short poses of live models. The poses ranged from 1 minute to 45 minutes, with many around 20 minutes. This book presents the history of sketches Mr. Lew made at such sessions. Each sketch is accompanied by commentary on what the artist was trying to achieve. There are a few longer discussions on topics throughout, at the start of each chapter. The book progresses from use of dry medium (e.g., pencil) for sketching, into greyscale watercolor, to watercolor using all colors, into semi-abstractionism.  <br /> <br />The comments and pictures have useful information, and show quite clearly the value of practicing from live models in short poses. Also, this book has a few valuable lessons; like, if you are getting borred, try something new, and the importance of backgrounds.  After reading this book, I found myself trying some of these ideas on 15 to 60 minute poses with a live model.  So, while my first impression was 3 stars, this earned \\"Painting from Life\\" a forth star.  Advice on paiting that I can actually use is quite worthwhile! <br /> <br />It seems to me that the technique and approach displayed is entirely dissimilar from that of Charles Reid, though his books as well use sketches rather than finnished drawings for most illuminations.	2005-05-12

I read books 2 through 4 on the strength of that first book and found them enjoyable, though a bit repetative.  We read them aloud as a family, and looked forward each night to the next installment. Alas, I just can't say that about #5. <br /> <br />Harry Potter #5 is gloomy. Only two happy events occur in the entire first two thirds of the book, and both are very brief. A teacher is systematically cruel to Harry and no one (not Harry, not Dumbledore, NO ONE) lifts a finger to do anything about it. Malfoy's bad behavior is ignored, while Harry is punished for trivial deeds. Most of the plot could be summarized as \\"bad people do bad things and are rewarded.\\" I found this all very gloomy and depressing. I particularly disliked the message that adults will not help children who are in trouble. <br /> <br />If you like sad stories, give \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" a try.  For myself I expected better from J. K. Rowling.	2005-05-09

I'm glad so many people have really enjoyed this novel, but the total lack of negative reviews bothered me -- I just don't think this is a five star book. <br /> <br />The plot was inconsistent.  The leading lady appears to be incapable of making her own decisions.  The oracle tells her, and she obeys -- unless her husband asks her to do something, in which case she immediately does the opposite.  She treats her husband quite poorly -- gets married for mercenary reasons and seldom considers his feelings -- and then randomly acts in a affectionate manner.  The villagers' extreme hostility towards her and her magic just didn't make sense, particularly since they are constantly asking her for magical assistence.   <br /> <br />By the time she leaves home for good, the leading lady comes across as a selfish girl, who is incapable of respecting other people's customs.  The entirely plot up to that point was all \\"poor me\\", which I personally abhor.  Perhaps the last 3/4 of the book are better -- I cannot say.  <br /> <br />Anyway, if you decide to buy this book, good for you!  But don't build it up in your mind to be more than it is -- light entertainment, suitable to pass the time. <br />	2005-05-04

Reading through it, the theory & exercises all looked great. The \\"where are you at\\" test went well. Then we tried doing the first two exercises from \\"I before E.\\" This chapter teaches children the I before E rule, saying that this can be used to improve your spelling, something like: \\"I before E except after C as in receive, or in words sounding like A as in neighbor or sleigh, where E before I is the way.\\" I might not be spot-on with this quote, but that is the rule the child is supposed to learn & use.  <br /> <br />The first exercise has 5 words with letters scrambled & a description of the word (e.g., every room has this, with \\"ceiling\\" scrambled). This was fine, but just barely starts to teach the child the IE/EI rule. The second exercise has rows of 5 words. The child is told to use the rule (poem) to determine which words are spelled correctly, and which words are spelled incorrectly. They are to find a path from correctly spelled word to correctly spelled word across a board. Fine, right?  <br /> <br />NO!  <br /> <br />The first word on the first row of list DOES NOT FOLLOW THE RULE! The word is mis-spelled, but will check out as okay according to the rule -- seize, spelled sieze. Nothing has been said in the instructions that there even ARE rule breakers! By following the rules -- as instructed! -- the child is being taught to mis-spell words! Then the correctly spelled word in the second row -- the only correctly spelled word -- also does not follow the rule -- foreign.  You will take a child who is having trouble with their spelling and confuse them even more. <br /> <br />This book DESPERATELY needs the editor to have a team of technical reviewers go through, perform all of the exercises, and correct errors.  <br /> <br />*    *     *     * <br /> <br />After picking up this book from where we had thrown it (litterally) across the room, we decided to give it a second chance.  The section for the second rule is very well done, and quite helpful.  We are just starting into the third section, and overall the book looks promising.

But afte rthat first helping hand, the youth's turbulent past entangles Taverik in a world of high politics and dark magic, and turns his own comfortably materialistic way of life upside down in more ways than one. When it is proven to him that he has been chosen along with Marco to defend the land against an encroaching evil that seems inexorable, Zandro wants nothing to do with his god-given role. Of course, he has no choice...\\"  <br /> <br />Taverik trades fine carpets.  He is trying to establish himself as an honest merchant, which is difficult because his father and brother are both corrupt, and his father owns the business Taverik runs.  As the book starts, he is returning from a purchasing trip to a nearby city-state.  He is in a wagon train accompanied by guards and a young carpet trader whom Taverik has taken under his wing, Marko.  They are attacked by bandits, and Marko is injured.  Taverik discovers that Marko is secretly a young lady, posing as a man to support herself & her sister.  Marko & her sister are hiding from a powerful enemy who took over a nearby city-state years before.  Taverik and Marko work together to investigate why her enemy is after her & want her dead.  Meanwhile, that same enemy captures a nearby city-state and then sneaks into Taverik's city, intent upon taking over this city, too. <br /> <br />Hawk's Flight is an enjoyable book about a young man with a corrupt father growing into the person he wants to be. The setting is midieval with magic, the plot fast paced, the characters interesting. Taverik and Marko are very likable people, and I greatly enjoyed watching them grow and change, as they were confronted with difficult choices.  Most of the book is from Taverik's point of view, and the occasional view-changes are well performed.  My only regret is that Carol Chase apparently never wrote anything else.	2005-04-20

The leading man's brother & allies offend her mightily before the main couple meet, much of which turns out to be a misunderstanding.  These allies want to take her younger siblings into their custody & move to another country.  She is offended & appalled & just can't calm down enough to talk clearly to them.  <br /> <br />The leading man is a 1700 (or so) year old vampire. He meets the her and instantly recognizes as the woman who can complete him; the light of his life. She distrusts him (due to his brother & allies' actions) but finds him physically irresistable.  Meanwhile, her trusted friend is murdered and some evil vampires show up to threaten everyone.  I suggest you let the rest of the plot be a surprise. <br /> <br />I wouldn't call \\"Dark Secret\\" light entertainment, but it is an enjoyable casual read filled with action and romance. The plot is romatic, exactly as promised, and the physical attraction between the couple is certainly well portrayed. In my opinion, the book's major faults are all in the first third.  The leading man's wooing strategy is to tell her that she will be his wife, an ultimatum that is not softened even by a \\"hi, you're cute.\\"  This is pretty offensive and doesn't exactly leave the reader liking him!  The leading woman is also pretty offensive here.  She's wildly attracted to him, has sex with him, and then turns around and accuses him of raping her!  Oh, please.  This is as bad as that lame \\"joke\\" about the woman who says \\"Don't!  ... Stop! ... Don't stop!\\"  Personally, I think this doesn't fit the definition of rape, but I can sympathise with other reviewers who did.  Anyway, once you are past that, there aren't any more obnoxious plot elements. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Dark Secret\\" was enjoyable but not memorable.	2005-04-19

For those of you who loved this book, more power to you! Here are my two cents worth. <br /> <br />'Ritual of Proof' describes a futuristic society established by man-hating feminists.  These ladies traveled by space ship to a new world, and upon arrival genetically engineered the human race (particularly the men) to suit their political & sociological goals.  This occurs centuries before the story starts.  The rest of the plot I'll leave to someone who liked the book to describe; I'm unable to be unbiased enough to do it justice. <br /> <br />When I started `Ritual of Proof,' I was expecting a Romance novel.  Instead, this is a gender reversed satire of a Romance novel, combined with a political & sociological commentary on genders.  This book is also a Drama.  I find Drama to be depressing & boring, and if I've purchased a Romance Novel, the last thing I want to be reading is Drama!  However, if you are expecting this, you might enjoy `Ritual of Proof.'   <br /> <br />Also, I found the leading \\"lady\\" to be actively repulsive.  I just couldn't get past this.  Her personality and most of her society seemed to be based on the theme of \\"let's do something nasty to a man.\\"  This constant hate speech smothered my enjoyment of the book.  The Romance novels which are the target of this book's satire do not contain such hateful speech targeting women. <br /> <br />With this said, I've very much enjoyed Dara Joy's other books.  Regardless of whether you liked `Ritual of Proof' or not, I recommend you give her other books a try. <br />	2005-04-19

The only plot detail I really recall is that the last third of the book isn't as well done as the first two thirds of the book.     What I found unique and precious in \\"Counterfeit Lady\\" is that the main couple are happy together.  For the middle third to half of the book, the couple are happily married and enjoy each other's company -- no arguments, no strife, no misunderstandings or secrets, no one out to kill them, just happy.  After all of those other Romance novels filled with misunderstandings & strife, this pleasant atmosphere is refreshing and quite enjoyable.  \\"Counterfeit Lady\\" conveys that joyful feeling of being in love.

Alexa (a lawyer) is summoned there from our universe by a committee of mages who seek a powerful mage to defeat an invading horde of evil monsters.  In that universe, Alexa has an incredibly powerful magical talent, more powerful than that of the most experienced mage (which is why they summoned her).  She arrives confused & unable to speak their language & heartbroken over the death of a close friend.  Without explaining what has occurred, the mages immediately test Alexa's abilities and character.  This leaves Alexa with a mighty poor attitude toward the mages.  Satisfied, the committee then uses a magical date rape drug on Alexa, because sex will tie Alexa mystically to her partner & thus diminish her chances of returning home.  Alexa resists the drug & refuses.  <br /> <br />The following negotiations between the committee and Alexa are a weak point of the book.  Alexa doesn't know how to apologize and is way too domineering -- her conflict resolution strategy is to issues ultimatums or walk away.   She seldom considers other people's needs and feelings when her needs conflict with theirs.  Sure, the committee was obnoxious, but Alexa is now just as bad.  Eventually, when they agree to obey her every whim, Alexa agrees to help & starts training.   <br /> <br />From here out, the Fantasy/Adventure side of the novel is pretty good -- melodramatic and light hearted and fun.  The book has a host of interesting and enjoyable supporting characters, including a small fairy (sort of), and a rebel fighter. The setting is imaginative, the magic system interesting, and the mystic creatures enjoyable.  The personalities of the various people on the committee are nicely developed. <br /> <br />About half way through the book, the author throws in a poorly done romantic sub-plot.  Alexa is lonely & seeks out a one night stand.  Without introducing herself or asking his name, she indulges in a night of explicit & lengthily described sex; telling herself & him all of the time that she doesn't expect this to be more than a one night stand.  Part way through, she feels the mystic connection to him that the committee had hoped would tie her to this universe.  She decides that they are meant to be together for the rest of their lives but (typically) doesn't say anything (more poor communication skills.)  The next morning, he discovers who she is, presumes he was tricked into having sex with her by the committee (a logical conclusion), and leaves.  Alexa's response is this rediculous \\"boo-hoo he left in the morning\\" nonsense, followed by deep mourning & hurt feelings.  When he returns to see her & perchance build a relationship, she responds to him with anger and (her usual negotiation style) demands that he apologize repeatedly for (get this) leaving after a one night stand, when that was the plan all along.  ALL of the bystanders take her side, and Alexa never does apologize (and she SHOULD).  Well, the \\"romance\\" plot gets weaker & weaker from there, and makes less and less sense.  He goes from being a strong and interesting character to being a submissive wimp.  Still, I'll not describe it further, since you might like this plot line.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book will appeal strongly to everyone who likes Mercedes Lackey's writings.  I liked \\"Guardian of Honor\\" enough to read another book in this universe, though I do hope that the next one will have a leading lady who is less pushy & more friendly.	2005-04-12
US	50924246	RH0415R74PXBX	0515138649	273244523	The Paid Companion	Books	2	7	9	N	N	lacks passion	Personally, I find the most useful reviews to be someone who loved the book; and someone who didn't.  For those of you who loved this book, more power to you!  Here are my two cents worth. <br /> <br />This book is set in Regency England.  The leading man is an Earl who has been jilted, and decides to choose his next wife from the ranks of paid companions, the theory being that his next wife will be more appreciative of him.  The leading woman is penniless, lacks relatives, has also been jilted, has just lost her last job as a paid companion, and insults every prospective employer she meets (including the leading man.)  Following current trend in Romance, the leading man loves this, and hires her on the spot.  However, he doesn't really want her as a wife, what he really wants is for her to pretend to be his fiance while he investigates a murder.  \\"Paid Companion\\" is polished and well written and the mystery is low key.  <br /> <br />Quick's early works were light hearted and fun, with charming leading couples and fun personalities, full of the author's enjoyment of romance.  This book lacks passion.  My main impression was that Quick now finds writing Romance novels to be a borring endeavor.  <br /> <br />The leading man is rich and handsome and ... well, he doesn't really seem to have much more personality than that.  The leading woman is outspoken and pushy and assertive to the point of being obnoxious.  Her personality was particularly disapointing because it went entirely contrary to the quite interesting plot described on the cover (i.e., of a man chosing a paid companion for wife because he wanted a wife who would be appreciative and obedient.)   <br /> <br />The Romance side of the plot is entirely formula and barely adequate at that.  Heavy petting scene 1/4 of the way through; obligatory sex scene half way through; a half-hearted sex scene toward the end; concluding with a proposal of marriage.  The writing quality is quite good, but altogether I simply was borred.	2005-04-11

The word that best describes \\"Exile's Honor\\" is mellodramatic.  The main character spends a lot of time feeling sorry for himself, exagerating his problems, basking in the sympathy of friends, and boasting.  This is quite fun if you are in the mood.      The plot and setting and personalities are similar to all of Mercedes' other books:  her main characters are powerful & highly skilled, have problems with teasing & not fitting in, receive unquestioning affection from a mystic friend, and have casual sex.  The setting is a magical / fantasy variant of the middle ages.	2005-04-06

The plot centers around a lady with amnesia, who is being chased by several apparently hostile groups.  Over the book, she re-learns mystic powers and figures out what is going on.   <br /> <br />The plot is fast paced and filled with action.  There is a bit of a romance, but nothing like you would find in a \\"Romance\\" novel -- pretty light weight stuff and not the focus of the book.  The universe includes several alien races, telepathy, teleportation, space travel, kidnappings, fights, and rediscovererd friends.  The main characters have consistent and likeable personalities.  The author does a nice job at visually describing scenery without slowing down the pace and ballances action & dialog.  About 70% of the book is from Miss Amnesia's point of view, and about 30% pops around between different viewpoints. <br /> <br />Why only 3 stars?  I'm not sure.  Maybe I've just read too many novels where with an \\"oh, dear, I've got amnesia and so many enemies\\" plot.  Also, I don't like viewpoint changes.  Still, \\"Thousand Words for Stranger\\" is an entertaining read.	2005-04-06

Like other popular serials (Xanth, Bellgaraid, Harry Potter), the first book you read is new & exciting.  After that, each book takes place in the same universe, same characters, same villains, same conflict, same plot -- with just minor changes & variations.  \\"Scepters\\" was as repetitious & borring as the last slice of a large meat loaf I've been eating all week.  This book could have been wonderful if more changes were made (e.g., Alucius had gained wisdom over the years and became proactive rather than reluctantly reactive; and if Alucius set out on his own rather than being forced into the millitary yet again). <br /> <br />With that aside, this book is well written, and if you've not read the previous two books, none of my objections apply.  Likewise, if you love reading series books & can't imagine why I would get borred after the first one or two, then by all means buy \\"Scepters\\" -- you'll love it.	2005-03-28

Alas, I am not a visual learner, and so much of the impact was lost.  If you are, I strongly recommend you get this book.    All lessons are displayed mainly in comparison pictures:  the same scene done two ways, once without the recommended technique, and once with the recommended technique.  This is the \\"salvage paintings\\" stuff that other reviewers mention.  These painting comparisons are scattered throughout the book and cover all topics.  The comparison pictures are very effective pictoral representations of the technique lessons described herein.    For myself, I don't like landscapes and I wasn't particularly impressed by the author's painting style.  Still, this book has a lot of useful advice on painting technique.

Busy with those hobbies and supporting herself, she hasn't yet dated and is eager to start.  Tinker is bold, brave, cheerful, but fairly ignorant of men.  Her parents are dead, but she has loving family ties with her cousin and several people within the city.  These relationships provide a realism and richness to \\"Tinker\\".    The setting is Pitsburgh in 2036, a city that spends one day on Earth and the rest of the month mechanically/magically teleported to Elf-land.  Tinker has spent her whole life there and knows more of elves & magic than Earth history or custom, but she hasn't had much contact with elves.  The elves are very long lived (thousands of years) and have a comparitively small population base.  This setting is quite interesting and enjoyable to explore.    I greatly enjoyed this book, but I must admit that the less enthused reviewers were correct.  There is content, including rape and torture scenes, that some readers might find inappropriate.  These are not the main focus of the plot or book, but I wouldn't recommend this book to teens & young adults.  Alternately, consider skipping forward.	2005-03-07

The setting is Regency England, and the leading man (Rejar) a mystic being from another universe.  The leading lady, Lillac, is attracted to Rejar but is uncomfortable around him.  Rejar has fallen for her completely but doesn't realize it yet, and tries to seduce her into an affair by visiting her dreams (heavy petting).  There is plenty of passion in their relationship, but it comes off nicely -- not the \\"obligatory sex scene occuring half way through\\" that so many Romance novels have.    The best part of this book though wasn't the plot or the setting but the personalities.  Mrs. Joy does a wonderful job of introducing passing moods:  embarressment, hurt feelings, joys, humours, and whims.  These pass and change without overdevelopping into ultimatums or long term misunderstandings.   Both Lilliac and Rejar (get this!) appologise to each other when realizing they've hurt the other person.  They work through \\"who's dominant in what situation\\" disagreements without forgetting that they care for each other.    Try it; you'll like it.	2005-03-04

The value of this book is in these observations, which help the artist notice more.  For example, what shadows look like, and how reflections and transparency impact water and metal and glass.  These observations focus mainly on topics that will be useful to people interested in painting still life, buildings, and perhaps nature scenes.  These observations will be less helpful for painters who are interested in figure painting, as the interplay of light on skin & hair is not addressed.  Overall, this aspect of the book is very well done and deserves 4 to 5 stars.   <br /> <br />The watercolor technique aspect of this book is not as well done.  The main teaching technique used are step-by-step paintings.  These are done better than most but, frankly, I fail to see the value of step-by-step instruction.  For me, these fail to generalize the author's knowledge into useful watercolor techniques.  The step-by-step instruction appears to be aimed at a beginner painter, whereas the rest of the book is intermediate to advanced.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very nice book that is well worth purchasing.  \\"Painting Spectacular Light Effects in Watercolor\\" is particularly nice as an inspirational book for watercolor artists.	2005-03-01

He has grown up feeling affection for his slaves, and is horrified at the poor treatment his slaves receive from his father & the other masters.  Our hero is unable to help his slaves in any way -- again, and again, and again, and again.

The role of the \\"Chosen\\" is to give people in the kingdom a hero to go to for help.  Much of the book revolves around Devlin's heroic missions and his at first unwilling efforts to improve the kingdom.

This is exactly what she needs to improve her reading skills, and I've found nothing else she is half as willing to read.  Some of the jokes use words she doesn't know; a 12 year old would understand all of the jokes and also find the book suitable.  Example jokes: \\"what is a kitten's favorite color?

These topics include the understanding the propper proportion of light & dark values, the importance of distinct colors, how to get better looking colors (e.g., lights, darks, greens, skin tones), why some edges should be blurred and which ones, how to (and not to) arrange objects in a painting, how to tie objects together into a cohesive whole, the relative importance (or lack thereof) of propper perspective, techniques for better looking shadows, the importance of sketches, and many more topics.  For each topic, the author includes one or more generally worded exercises that will help the reader practice the technique.  These are not those awful step-by-step-reproduce-my-painting-exactly sort of exercises, either, but well thought out tasks that will help you see the importance of the technique in your own work.  There is a very nice section at the end which demonstrates common problems and how to fix them.

Some reasons why people act like bullies are listed, which mainly focuses on the disproven hypothesis that most bullys have low self esteme -- actually, most bullys have over inflated self esteme.  Oh, yes, and there is a chapter on how to be a victim.  Throughout the book, the author promises (repeatedly) that advice on how to actually handle the bully will be forthcoming.      However, that is not the case.  The only advice given is one brief sentence saying don't get angry, don't hide, do confront the bully.  Now, I understand this is a difficult topic to address, but given the title of the book -- Taking the Bully by the Horns -- I expected more than that one weak platitude.  The rest of that chapter addresses other topics, like use violence as a last resort, don't transport drugs, and be kind to siblings.    Some portions of this book are well written.  This book might help your child recognize some subtle forms of teasing.  For that, it gets two stars from me instead of one star.	2005-01-06

The first section is a 5-star short story, of the main character emprisoned by vampires -- see the back cover -- and very well done.  The second section is predominated by first person monologues describing the world and the main character getting up at 4am, cooking till 10 pm, & saying \\"poor me\\" a lot.  The setting is indeed interesting, but this part drags a bit.  The third part explores the main character's developing powers, several uneasy relationships, and further vampire conflicts.  The second & third parts are interesting, but really 2 to 3 star material -- like the author took a great short story & padded the ending until it was long enough to be called a book. <br /> <br />On the down side: too few issues are resolved, too much meaningless sex, and far too much time spent in first person monologues.  On the up side:  the setting is fascinating & well displayed, the characters' personalities are consistent, and the one \\"other\\" race explored in detail (vampires) is well characterized and different enough from humans to capture interest.	2005-01-03

Werewolves, shaman, witches, and half-demons (among other creatures) lead secret lives, hiding their abilities from humans.  A secret group of scientists, funded by a rich & rather twisted ecentric, are capturing and studying mystic creatures -- a process that is often fatal.  Now they want to study a werewolf ...  <br /> <br />This is the first book I've read by Kelley Armstrong, and it can easily be read independently from \\"Bitten\\".  Kelley's writing style is nicely done, the plot was interesting, but I just wasn't engrosed by this story.  Perhaps it just wasn't my cup of tea.   <br /> <br />The only flaw I can readily identify is this.  Many characters did not behave consistently, and these small inconsistencies bothered me.  When free, the main character acts aggressively & protects her independence from her husband to a degree that both doesn't make sense (given her race) and doesn't speak well for her marriage (from a human point of view).  But as soon as she is captured, she just ... folds.  As another example, there were no rape scenes (good for you Kelley, I abhor rape scenes), but given the personalities of several villians, this just didn't make sense.  Too often, the author compromised characters' personalities to obtain the plot outcome she wanted. <br /> <br />Overall, I predict that the average reader would give \\"Stolen\\" 4-stars.	2004-12-21
US	50924246	R1VS9WJBIZ9OBW	0060598247	607344832	The Chronicles of Narnia	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A wonderful series of stories for children & young adults	\\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" is a series of seven short books that take place mostly in a mystic relm named \\"Narnia\\".  Most books involve a small group of young children from our world traveling to Narnia and back.  Narnia is a land with talking animals, kings and queens, fauns, an evil sorceress, swords and bows, sailing ships, giants, dragons, and other mystic creatures.  There are mystic creatures everywhere but relatively little magic, all things considered.  The books contain an occasional picture, at the beginning of each chapter, and are intended for independent readers of ages perhaps 9 to 15.  Stories are fast paced adventure stores that contain very little violence.  I read these books over & over again when I was young and enjoyed them all greatly.<br /><br />The first book has decidedly Christian overtones -- not openly discussed or presented, but similarity to the story of Jesus is pretty obvious.  The other six books don't have religous themes.  All books gently encourage good behavior by examining the problems associated with fear, greed, jealousy, bullying, and so forth.  Each book depicts children making mistakes and learning from those mistakes, in a gentle manner that is fun and inoffensive.<br /><br />I warmly recommend \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" for any young reader.	2004-12-17

Unlike most books on this topic, \\"Helping the Child Who Doesn't Fit In\\" actually addresses social skills (e.g., don't stand too close).  The other books I've tried either teach manners (e.g., please & thank you) or teach your child to obey house rules (e.g., pick up toys without being told).  Thats all well and good, but it does nothing to improve your child's social skills!    This book gets 5 stars from me (excellent quality) because it (1) clearly explains several key aspects of social skills, and (2) lists a variety of effective ways to teach these skills to your child.	2004-12-16

The songs all need a piano, so we've not tried them.  The stories & poems range from 1 to 3 pages and appropriate for a 2nd grade reading level or above.   Some of the stories are nice, some are funny, some hit you over the head with the authors message, some are re-writes of very old stories that may or may not appeal, and \\"Teeny Meany\\" makes the villian sound too appealing.  Overall, this is a nice bed-time book for children old enough to look at one picture for a few minutes while Mom (or child) reads 200 to 400 words.  Most stories have a message that can be discussed.  Unfortunately, the title & cover do not appeal to children.  In my opinion, this book is \\"Good\\" quality but not \\"Excellent\\".	2004-12-16

My final rating is: 5 stars for teens or adults with previous origami experience; & 2 stars for Elementary school children. <br /> <br />Positive Aspects:  A nice supply of origami paper in red, yellow, light green, dark green, brown, and blue.  A sturdy instruction booklet with cardboard pages & spiral binding that includes over 20 shapes.  Several really nice Christmas origami shapes, such as santa, reindeer, stocking, holly leaves with berries, and a snow flake.  Several nice non-Christmas origami shapes are included for variety, such as a pony, and a heart,  <br /> <br />Negative Aspects:  Instructions presume previous experience with origami.  Shapes are not suitable for young children -- all were too complicated for my 8 year old daughter.  Some of the instructions are difficult to follow.  Mind you, the final shape is worth the effort but, still, it took me two tries to correctly make some of the shapes. <br /> <br />p.s., the holly leaves look much better if you cut the paper into quarters & work with the smaller squares.	2004-12-15

However, this book is weak on the issue most concerning anyone who would buy it.  Specifically, the author does not offer advice on what to do if your child is being teased.  Most of this book comes down to the following statement:  children with poor social skills are teased.  The authors's solution:  read the book, \\"Helping the Child Who Doesn't Fit In.\\"  Personally, I think the author's premise is overly simplistic, but that other book does appear to be worth trying.   <br /> <br />The bottom line is, when you've read this entire book, won't have an answer to \\"Mom, They're Teasing Me.\\"	2004-12-13
US	50924246	R19WMG6HRKMZFN	0553581236	587754980	The Perfect Princess	Books	2	8	8	N	N	Contrived and inconsistent	Sorry, but I cannot support the general \\"how great this is\\" sentiment.  Elizabeth Thornton is a talented author, but this particular book is inconsistent and very contrived.  All goes well up to our hero's escape from jail, which is interestingly executed and deserves 4 stars. However, from there ... the \\"who did it\\" aspect is non-existent (we find out from alternate point-of-view chapters quite early on); her body guards letting her go into a jail without escort is absurd; the author states clearly in the opening that lady is extremely polite and likable, but she doesn't act that way after entering the jail (she immediately transforms into bold adventure woman); the hero keeping her captive for so long feels contrived; everyone you can shake a stick at decides that he is innocent and must be helped; she falls in love with him without him once making her feel desired or desirable; and so on.  What this book really needs is a technical reviewer to go through & tighten up all of the loose ends & inconsistencies.  The first few chapters promised an lady concerned that she is too nice, too accomodating, too sheltered, and yet unable to change her basic personality.  Had that personality been maintained, this would have been a better book.	2004-12-08

This book is not.  Contrary to the cover and the opening chapter, Matt plays a supporting actor, not the title role.  Matt's interesting personality, actions, and introspection do not appear in this book.   <br /> <br />\\"The Crusading Wizard\\" focuses on a girl wizard who can change into a cat.  Her personality is flat and uninspired, both as girl and cat.  Much of the charm of the first book in this series was the portrayal of a midieval society through another mind set: angles & devils are living creatures, \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" are absolutes, and kings rule by divine right.  Discarding that whole notion, \\"Crusading Wizard\\" is simply another midieval fantasy world with magic, nicely executed but bland.	2004-12-08

The plot centers around Poldarn, a man who has amnesia.  Poldarn quickly discovers that he is good at fighting, which is fortuitous because most people who recognize Poldarn are hostile.  \\"Shadow\\" is a bit fragmented with Poldarn's dreams (mystic visions?) of other people's lives; and the occasional chapter from another point of view.  Still, this book is well written, fast paced, unpredictable, and has an interesting idea:  if you had amnesia & kept getting hints that you're past was unpleasant, would you want to know who you had been?	2004-12-06

Two of the three main characters are particularly interesting:  an old man who is experiencing dimensia, and a compulsive middle aged man who discovers that some of his habits are magical spells.  The third main character is not:  the old man's loving granddaughter, whose attitudes regarding her live-in boyfriend are distasteful and selfish.  <br /> <br />The plot follows these three, who eventually confront an evil creature in Europe.  The plot is internally consistent, characterization nicely done, and the overall mood pleasant.  \\"Caves of Buda\\" is an enjoyable read, worthwhile but not \\"can't put it down\\".	2004-12-06
US	50924246	RKSQXGCC8LO4N	0553585177	571131857	Fires of the Faithful	Books	3	1	1	N	N	fragmented	This book has a great lead and a few interesting ideas, but the plot is fragmented, wandering without focus.  Whenever the book seems to settle down on something (music school, competing religions, evil magic, finding family, oppressive government), that plot line is put on the back burner and another takes over.  The same happens with secondary characters; as soon as you like them -- poof! -- they disappear.   <br /> <br />The \\"religious discourse\\" and weak Christianity links are overplayed by other reviewers -- this book does not go on a soap box preaching the author's religious message.  The main tenents of the two religions are never even defined.	2004-11-08

The beginning of the book introduces two main characters (soldier Tier & mage Seraph), neither of whom wants to spend their life doing what their societies think they should.  Rejecting what they are supposed to do with their lives, they marry and attempt to spend the rest of their lives as simple farmers.  Well, fate has other plans in store. <br /> <br />This is an ejoyable book.  There is a bit of a glitch (writing wise) in the middle, where the the book changes focus and hops around several new characters' point of view for awhile.  Still, the overall book hangs together and the primary characters' plots come to a satisfactory conclusion.	2004-08-26

The heroin's experience and perceptions of life as a &quot;vampire&quot; without &quot;our hero&quot; standing around saying how great life is.  The progression of the couple's relationship was quite different from Feehan's other books.  Some of the minor characters were very interesting.<br />Here is what I didn't like.  The heroin is a pessimist with low self esteem.  She lets traumatic experiences from her youth control her entire life.  The hero is too submissive.	2004-07-12

Our heroin's race (Shielders) are fighting a loosing battle with another race (Controlers), who want to take over the Universe.  A third race (Leor) are trying to stay neutral.  They have more advanced weaponry but a small, infertile population.  To combat this infertility, Leor chief Arion bargains for a Shielder wife.  (So far, so good.)<br />Jenna is an outcast among the Shielders due to her clairvoyant visions.  She is treated so badly, that she hides her face when walking in public, hoping not to be recognized.  Jenna volunteers to be the Arion's wife.  This could have been a strong point of the book, with Jenna hoping to improve her life, but instead she goes only because she believes she had a clairvoyant vision.  Jenna expects to be as poorly treated by the Leor as she was by the Shielders.  <br />Unfortunately for the reader, she is correct.  The Leor are barely civil to Jenna and actively prevent anyone from helping her learn the rules of their society.  The Leor society is activly repulsive:  totalitarian government, slavery, and childrent raised enmass by the government.  <br />Moreover, the plot elements keep getting more and more unreasonable.  Jenna welcomes her brother happily and unreservedly, despite knowing that he dislikes her and has actively avoiding seeing or talking to her for 14 years.  The Leor society allegedly respects people with clairvoyant visions, but there is no evidence of that in their treatment of Jenna.  Another Leor chief's inter-racial wife flaunts tribal law and customs without consequence, and convinces most people in her tribe to do likewise, also without consequence.  Jenna &amp; Arion's mystical marriage ceremony (a highlight of the book) should have helped her understand her husband and the society; despite all reason and logic dictating otherwise, it doesn't.<br />Overall, this is a depressing, negative, internally inconsistent book.  Mrs. Spangler's other books are far supperior to this one.  Buy one of them instead.	2004-04-13

The other 25% is enhancing that ink drawing with watercolor.  The pen &amp; ink predominates everywhere.  If this is the style of drawing you desire (e.g., detailed drawings where pen&amp;ink predominates), then you will probably give this book 4 to 5 stars.  I was looking for watercolor texture techniques and was disapointed.  <br />With that said, the drawings are very well executed and the instruction quality moderate.  The author relies too heavily on step-by-step examples as a teaching tool.  The addition of color greatly enhances the pen &amp; ink drawings, with spectacular results.	2004-02-27

The first half is a truly wonderful collection of decorative rooms and principles telling you how to make your own rooms look really nice.  The idea is to get rid of clutter and excess furnishings, and then artfully arange carefully chosen furnishings &amp; decorations to build a cohesive, peaceful room.  Some of the rooms are a bit too spartan for my tastes, but most are simply wonderful.  This book isn't about decorating style (e.g., country or modern) but how to use shape, texture, color, and materials to compose an inspiring display.  'Peaceful Spaces' touches upon Feng Shui, Zen, and Japeneese decorating style.<br />The second half of the book applies the principles to different rooms of the house &amp; office. <br />If decorating your house were an art class, then most books teach technique (e.g., how to do faux painting, how to decorate in the country style, how to recover a sofa, how to choose colors); whereas this book teaches composition (e.g., how to put the pieces together into a pleasing ensamble).  My experience with art classes &amp; decorating books is that actual advice on composition is very, very rare.  This book is a gem!	2003-03-28

While I cannot say I truly enjoyed reading this book, it was entertaining enough for my purposes at the time (a long airplane flight).  Light reading, I would say, to pass the time.  <br />My only real objection is that exactly twenty pages from the end of the book, with no warning or previous development whatsoever, the main character falls in love and gets married.  Mrs. Lackey, romance is not your genre, stick to fantasy.	2003-03-12

I've never read a book that took less care to be internally consistent.  This problem could have been easily identified and fixed by a complete novice, but the author & publishing company just didn't take the time.  Shame on them! <br />That said, the rest of the book is enjoyable.  Unlike her previous books, Mrs. Feehan gives the couple a bit of time to get aquainted before they commit to each other, which helps keep the second half of the book interesting.  The secondary characters have good character development, more than the author's usual.  The hero and his lady aren't simply clones of some previous book, and the plot contains a few surprises.  In all, the author's writing style is still steadily improving, which is in my opinion rare after about a dozen published books.<br />At the very end of this book is an interesting and appealing chapter from Feehan's upcoming book.	2003-03-12

On the down side, the sub-characters tend to be a bit flat, and the heroine, with her constant \\"my way or the high way\\" attitude toward our hero, more than a bit annoying.  The 'Heartmate' rules defy logic and sense, but that is ignorable.  Overall, this novel is better written than most Futuristic Romance novels, and well worth the purchase price.	2002-04-16
