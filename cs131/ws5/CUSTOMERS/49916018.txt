There are a number of things that make \\"Rise of the Vulcans\\" the most useful and compelling book on Bush foreign policy written to date.<br /><br />First and foremost, veteran LA Times reporter Jim Mann is uncommonly objective and earnest from beginning and end.  This is a book that doesn't seek to defend or excoriate, but rather to explain why the Bush Administration undertook actions after September 11th that were a radical departure from traditional American foreign policy of either political party.  In that sense, \\"Vulcans\\" is a refreshing alternative to the existing line-up of shallow diatribes both for and against the administration that have come to overcrowd the shelves of your local bookstore.<br /><br />Second, Mann's model of a group biography is the perfect tool for achieving his goal of explaining the actions taken during the Global War on Terror.  I love biographies, but I often find myself frustrated by biographers who give short shrift to the early years and most formative experiences of their subject in a rush to get to the main events of the personal narrative.  The vast majority of the biographical vignettes in this book focus on the characters' life well before they became household names and examine how those experiences shaped their worldview and, perhaps more importantly, defined the interpersonal relationships within the group.  In fact, the events following 9/11 represent a small part of the overall story.<br /><br />Third, \\"Vulcans\\" sheds light on the origins and philosophy of the neo-conservative movement as well as the intense internal conflicts within the Bush Administration that were present from the beginning but boiled over as the US moved toward war with Iraq.  Mann moves beyond the shrill caricatures of the \\"neo-cons\\" and the many silly conspiracy theories attributed to it and its members and offers an illuminating review of its roots in the anti-D&eacute;tente movement of the 1970s and the conservative Democrats that inspired it, such as Dean Acheson, Paul Nitze and Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson. Of the six people profiled, arguably only Paul Wolfowitz is a bona fide \\"neo-con\\" but obviously those ideas have taken on a tremendous importance in the current administration.  I suspect that many ill-informed neo-con haters will discover that they are quite sympathetic with the underlying motivation of neo-conservativism (i.e. a deep belief in the importance of values, morality and democracy in the conduct of foreign policy), if not necessarily its means of achieving those ends.<br /><br />Finally, Mann writes with the clarity and purpose of the seasoned journalist he is.  \\"Vulcans\\" moves with the same fluidity and grace as books written by other great foreign policy correspondents, such as Stanley Karnow, Neil Sheehan, David Halberstam and Tom Friedman.<br /><br />In closing, if you are going to read one book on current foreign policy \\"Rise of the Vulcans\\" should be it.  It is substantive, honest and well written.  No matter your current political viewpoints, reading \\"Vulcans\\" will make you a more informed and (hopefully) more thoughtful participant in debates on contemporary American foreign policy.he 1970s and the conservative Democrats that inspired it, such as Dean Acheson, Paul Nitze and Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson.

US	49916018	R2NY7M3UQGW9CB	0394719964	585481938	A rope of sand;: The colonial agents, British politics, and the American Revolution	Books	4	7	7	N	N	An interesting viewpoint	I've been writing reviews on Amazon every so often for the past few years.  Many of my reviews begin with the admonition \\"this book isn't for everyone.\\"  Such is the case with Michael Kammen's \\"A Rope of Sand,\\" first published in 1968 and long considered an essential work on the obscure but important role of the colonial agents in London leading up to the American Revolution.  I found that Kammen stressed three points that were critical in the fateful decade between the Stamp Act crisis and the beginning of the Revolution at Lexington and Concord.<br /><br />First, the ascension of George III in 1760 and the momentous events of the Seven Years War and its aftermath ushered in a long period of political instability in London.  Administrations rose and fell with alarming rapidity, which had deleterious affects on colonial relations for two reasons: 1) the lack of domestic political stability pushed colonial issues down the priority scale of government business; and 2) the constantly shifting sands of power meant that colonial agents were always trying to determine whose opinion was most influential at any given time.  Moreover, when stability did begin to reemerge under the administration of Lord North in the early 1770s, a policy of firmness on Parliamentary supremacy toward the colonies was one of the major unifying themes.<br /><br />Second, it is difficult to overestimate just how uninformed most British government officials were on colonial life and affairs in the late 1760s and early 1770s.  Kammen provides one illuminating quote from the floor of Parliament where a \\"respectable counsellor at law\\" was heard to ask whether Philadelphia was in the East or West Indies and that \\"he had a notion that it was on the coast of Sumatra.\\"<br /><br />Third, Kammen argues that economic considerations dominated the course of events between 1765 and 1774.  In the depression years following the Seven Years War trade with the colonies formed an essential component of British merchant revenue.  However, over time the economy began to recover and new markets to the east opened up to trade.  In the meantime, cracks in the colonial nonimportation program began to show.  Thus, as the crisis deepened in the early 1770s the colonies had lost one of their most important domestic pressure groups.<br /><br />In sum, Kammen argues that the extra constitutional structure of the colonial agents represented a great missed opportunity in the years leading up to the American Revolution.  Some of the men holding agent relationships, such as Benjamin Franklin and Edmund Burke, were exceptional, but most were lacking in talent and had no definitive set of instructions from their colonial employers.  On the other hand, he also is quite critical of the British imperial administration, which went out of its way to muzzle agents in London and question the validity of their mission without presenting alternative means for communicating colonial grievances to the Crown, cabinet and Parliament.  For the serious student of early American history, this is an essential study of a misunderstood and misused role in colonial relations.itish merchant revenue.

I had forgotten what a truly gifted writer he is.  \\"The Great Bridge\\" was McCullough's second major work of history (published in 1972) and has been ranked #48 on The Modern Library's list of the \\"100 Best Non-Fiction Books.\\"<br /><br />Few authors of non-fiction can craft a narrative as exquisitely as McCullough.  His chapters hop from detailed overviews of the history and technology of suspension bridge building in the mid-nineteenth century to biographical vignettes of the major characters to a review of political corruption and the Tweed Ring in New York City to the medical explanation of decompression sickness (i.e. \\"the bends\\") all without missing a beat and drawing the reader deeper into the story.  One gets the sense that even if McCullough chose to write about the construction of a lonely stretch of West Texas highway he would somehow make it riveting.<br /><br />Of course, the Brooklyn Bridge was far from a trivial undertaking.  It was the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World.\\"  It was the greatest suspension bridge in the world during a period when such structures had a frightening propensity to tumble out of the sky taking scores of people to their deaths.<br /><br />The most awe-inspiring thing about the bridge is that it was designed using nothing more than paper, pencils and the human mind.  The chief engineers - the father-and-son duo of John and Washington Roebling - didn't have the benefit of CAD/CAM programs for bridge design or super computers to run sophisticated regressions to test the strength of the bridge under millions of combinations of weather and weight conditions.  They did all of this themselves using longhand linear algebra and advanced calculus.<br /><br />Perhaps even more impressive than the mathematical acumen required for the task was the physical exertion it required on the part of the work crew.  The two massive caissons on either shore of the East River were sunk upwards of 80 feet using nothing more than picks and shovels in the frightful environment of the nine-foot compressed air tomb on the river floor.  And in the absence of medical knowledge on the effects of rapid decompression, a great share of the work crew, including Washington Roebling himself, suffered lifelong debilitation (and is several cases death) from \\"the bends.\\"<br /><br />David McCullough is a national treasure.

Nearly 100,000 people (knights, servants, women and children) departed from all over Western Europe and marched thousands of miles overland to Constantinople and then across the forbidding terrain of Asia Minor to the gates of Jerusalem.  In the process, they swept the fearsome Seljuk Turks from Anatolia, captured the major city of Antioch, took the Holy City in a fierce siege and annihilated several Moslem relief forces from Syria and Egypt along the way.  By comparison, the Norman invasion of England and the Battle of Hastings in 1066 was a sideshow.<br /><br />Much of the secondary research on the First Crusade focuses on what motivated the mass expedition to reclaim the Holy Land in 1095 and how the rivalries between the leading princes on campaign led to the establishment of Christian city-states in the Levant.  Little energy has been devoted to explaining precisely how those remarkable achievements were attained, which is exactly what John France sets out to do in this book.<br /><br />The first three chapters review the basic nature of warfare in the eleventh century and demonstrate how the experience of fighting feudal wars in Western Europe directly shaped the military actions of the Crusaders in the East.  Above all, the author stresses that warfare in this period focused on the control of strategic strongholds and the ravaging of an enemy's land as a way to simultaneously support the invading army, destroy the enemy's economic base and alienate the local population from their supposed feudal protector.  Major set piece battles (such as Hastings) were a rarity and only fought under highly favorable conditions and for the greatest stakes possible.  These topics are covered in the first quarter of the book and are \\"generalist\\" in nature.<br /><br />The rest of the book offers a highly detailed analysis of the various military actions that made up the First Crusade.  France does an impressive job of primary research (including fieldwork) to present a comprehensive review of how, when, where and why the Crusaders engaged their various Moslem adversaries.  Every Crusading chronicle or memoir that had anything to say about a given battle is examined and assessed for accuracy.  His work is exhaustive and at times overwhelming in detail.  For instance, he devotes a hundred pages of dense analysis to the siege of Antioch alone.  If you're only looking for the \\"big picture,\\" the last three hundred pages of this book will be tough going.<br /><br />A couple final points on \\"Victory in the East.\\"  The author has included twenty-three maps and diagrams that greatly facilitate understanding of the various sieges and ambushes.  On the other hand, he writes paragraphs of Brobdingnagian dimensions.  It isn't uncommon for single paragraphs to span several pages, with the text just rolling on in one monolithic block as France goes from one subject to the next.  Needless to say, this style doesn't add to the readability of the rather arcane content.<br /><br />In closing, for those with a keen interest in Medieval Warfare and a strong pre-existing understanding of the First Crusade \\"Victory in the East\\" offers an impressive blend of research and analysis on a remarkable event in the annals of military history.  If your five favorite books on military history were written by authors with names like Clancy, Ambrose or Keegan, then this book most definitely isn't for you.ob of primary research (including fieldwork) to present a comprehensive review of how, when, where and why the Crusaders engaged their various Moslem adversaries.

US	49916018	R23337F47ICUJQ	052134770X	115357758	001: A History of the Crusades Vol. I: The First Crusade and the Foundations of the Kingdom of Jerusalem (Volume 1)	Books	5	16	16	N	Y	History at its finest	Steven Runciman's three-volume history of the Crusades (originally published in the early 1950s) is widely recognized as one of the greatest works of history written in the English language in the twentieth century.  As such, it is indispensable reading for any serious student of the crusading period or the Middle Ages in general, as well as those with a broad interest in military history or the Middle East.<br /><br />The remarkable thing about Runciman's work is that it is just as satisfying to the lay reader as it is to the scholar.  Casual readers could be frightened by the prospect of reading a three volume history and instead turn to one of the \\"introductions\\" available on the subject by Jonathan Riley-Smith, Hans Eberhard Meyer or Thomas Madden.  Believe me, you'll find reading Runciman much easier and more enjoyable than those books, which may be more concise but are also excruciatingly dull.<br /><br />In the introduction to Volume I Runciman clearly lays out his intentions: \\"I believe that the supreme duty of the historian is to write history, that is to say, to attempt to record in one sweeping sequence the great events and movements that have swayed the destinies of man.\\"  Runciman is true to his goal.  Modern scholars may disagree with some of his assertions, but no one can argue that he fell short in writing a captivating history of a crucial epoch in world civilization.<br /><br />A couple of points on Runciman's style and conclusions bear mentioning.  First, he places strong emphasis on the importance of individuals and their ability to sway the course of great events.  (This is also a main reason why his work is so much more interesting than other books on the subject.)  In his narrative of the First Crusade no figures loom larger than the papal legate Adhemar, Bishop of Le Puy, and the crusading prince from Italian Normandy, Bohemond.<br /><br />Runciman suggests that Adhemar was the Crusade's indispensable man.  The only individual with the talent, will and integrity to manage the polyglot crusading armies to fulfill the desires of Pope Urban II: cooperation with Byzantium and its emperor Alexius Comnenus and adherence to the fundamentally spiritual and penitential mission of retaking Jerusalem from the Moslems.  His death from typhoid after the siege of Antioch in 1098 is described as a critical turning point in the history of the Crusades as it deprived the movement of the one individual with the authority to unite and control the warrior princes that swept into the Levant on their ostensibly holy mission.  To make matters worse, Adhemar's replacement as papal legate - Daimbert of Pisa - proved to be just as ambitious, self-interested and manipulative as the competing princes, a fact that did much to promote the infighting and land-grabbing that led to the competing Christian states in Outremer.<br /><br />Bohemond - arguably the greatest crusading general ever, not just of the First Crusades but the entire crusading period out to the thirteenth century - is portrayed by Runciman as something of an antagonist to Adhemar and the whole noble cause of the crusade as preached by Urban at the Council of Clermont and beyond.  He is written as the embodiment of the rapacious westerner seeking a rich principality in the East under the cloak of Christian piety.<br /><br />Second, from the perspective of military history, Runciman argues that the issues of logistics and sea control were critical to the success of the whole campaign.  Time and again the crusading armies were nearly destroyed not by marauding bands of Turks or Arabs (although they did pose a threat) but rather by a lack of water and food or from sheer exhaustion during the 1,300 km march across Anatolia to the Holy Lands.  On several occasions the crusaders were saved by the timely arrival of a Genoese or Venetian fleet bearing desperately needed supplies - including basic items such as nails and hammers to build the siege engines so critical in taking Jerusalem - and the challenge of capturing and maintaining control of a safe harbor on the Levantine coast as an entrepot for the Christian vessels.  (For more on the military aspects of the First Crusade, John France's \\"Victory in the East\\" is fantastic.)<br /><br />In closing, if you're looking to read only one book on the Crusades, Runicman's magisterial history should be your choice.  Don't let the size of the work intimidate you.  It is history at its finest and the extra time (and money) it will take to read his three volumes will be well worth it.and maintaining control of a safe harbor on the Levantine coast as an entrepot for the Christian vessels.

I have an advanced degree in International Relations and Strategic Studies in a program that emphasizes Clausewitz's writings and general influence in its curriculum, including a close, semester-long reading and discussion of \\"On War\\" in its entirety.  In addition, since graduating I've read several biographical sketches and insightful academic essays on Clausewitz and his theories by Michael Howard, Alan Beyerchan, Christopher Bassford, Barry Watts, and other noted Clausewitz scholars.  The only reason I picked this book up was because of the glowing praise it received from Williamson \\"Wick\\" Murray, one the nation's most prominent military historians, in a military bibliography he compiled as part of a DoD contract.  He listed \\"Clausewitz and the State\\" as one of twenty-five books making up \\"The Essential Military History Library.\\"  (To give the reader a sense, other books in this elite category include Thucydides' \\"History of the Peloponnesian War,\\" Clausewitz's \\"On War,\\" Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace,\\" Grant's \\"Memoirs\\" and Churchill's \\"Life of Marlborough.\\"  Lofty company, indeed.)  Given such a strong endorsement from such a qualified source, I felt compelled to add it to my reading list, although I was only expecting a \\"Clausewitz refresher.\\"  I was wrong.<br /><br />Paret's work is a masterful mix of biography, philosophy and history, which combine to provide the reader insights into Clausewitz's character and theories like no other secondary work has or likely ever will.<br /><br />The great feature of this book is the 360-degree view of Clausewitz it presents.  Even with the best intentions, most biographers end up presenting an idealized view of their subjects.  But the Clausewitz presented by Paret is entirely human.  It's a tall task to get a twenty-first century American to truly understand an early nineteenth century Prussian, but that's precisely what Paret's book enables.  The author includes a number of incisive quotations on Clausewitz from military performance evaluations, professional recommendations, book reviews of his work, and the diaries of leading socialites.  Some are effusive in praise; others are quite denigrating.  But nearly all capture the essence of a man of intense ambition and genius, but from a humble background, socially awkward and perceived (incorrectly) by the senior state leadership as a man with dangerously radical political tendencies.  All of this combined to create a remarkable career given his social roots, but nevertheless supremely frustrating to a man of rare ability.  The effect is similar to the character development of a great novelist.  You begin to feel that you actually know Clausewitz, as though he were a close, life-long acquaintance.  You begin to sense that you could accurately guess how he would react to any given situation.  All of this is more than just interesting reading: it makes Clausewitz's theories and intentions much more understandable.<br /><br />One of the most common complaints from Clausewitz critics and enthusiasts alike is that his original ideas and writings have been misunderstood and subsequently warped over the years.  Even some of the philosopher's sharpest critics - most notably the British military historian B.H. Liddell Hart - have conceded that much of the destruction done in Clausewitz's name is attributable to those who misread his true point or, more commonly, never actually read \\"On War\\" at all except for a few phrases taken out of context.  \\"Clausewitz and the State\\" was written as a companion to Paret's groundbreaking 1976 re-translation of \\"On War\\" and it should not be viewed as a substitute for that great work.

US	49916018	R1FJI6CBVCJ5LG	0898709547	495849619	What Were the Crusades?	Books	4	25	25	N	Y	One scholar's definition of "Crusade"	This slender volume by one of the world's leading scholars of the Crusading period is an excellent introductory on the subject.  It has little to do with the various campaigns that made up the Crusades themselves, but rather offers a coherent definition of what a \\"Crusade\\" really was.<br /><br />Riley-Smith argues that a \\"Crusade,\\" to be considered as such, must meet all of the following criteria: 1) it must be an open, voluntary and temporary vow to perform military service in the defense of a Christian place or people; 2) the campaign must receive explicit papal advocacy; 3) the participants must be granted certain privileges generally extended to Christian pilgrims; and, most importantly, 4) participants must receive generous indulgences against sins in return for their service.<br /><br />The author's definition is rather broad by other standards.  For instance, he directly rejects the notion that the Crusades focused exclusively on the recapture of the Holy Lands, with a special emphasis on Jerusalem.  But he also argues that actions that had an objective of national liberation (as opposed to the liberation of the Republic of Christ) and/or were led by secular monarchs rather than the pope - the Spanish Reconquista is the most obvious example - were not part of the crusading movement, properly defined.  Neither were the actions undertaken by the various religious military orders that developed in the Middle Ages, such as the Knights Templar and the Hospitallers, because those groups maintained selective admission standards and their vow was permanent, not temporary.<br /><br />The issue on which Riley-Smith differs most strongly and fundamentally with other leading scholars of the period is his belief that the motivations of the Crusaders were, in the main, pure and sincere.  He argues that individual crusaders were driven primarily by self-interest in the offer of plenary indulgence (i.e. the complete remission of guilt and punishment for sins both on earth and in the afterlife) with only a secondary consideration in serving the Republic of Christ; avarice and the lure of plunder in the East played no part.  The prospect of eternal salvation and the defense of God's Kingdom on Earth thus propelled the various campaigns that came to be known as the Crusades; they weren't smokescreens for conquest.<br /><br />One final note: \\"What were the Crusades?\\" is concise and introductory, but it isn't light.  Much of the material is dense and the first-time reader may find that they need to proceed slowly through the chapters to fully absorb the arguments.  Also, a good follow up book to this one is the classic overview of the Crusades by the German historian Hans Eberhard Mayer.

My hunch would be that most prospective readers are interested in learning about Rommel's legendary campaigns, especially those with the Afrika Korps, and this book certainly delivers on that account.  Fraser is better known as a novelist, and his writing reflects that heritage.  He keeps the drama high and openly professes his admiration for Rommel, both as a military leader and a man.<br /><br />As a biography, though, \\"Knight's Cross\\" fails to deliver much meaningful insight into the subject's true character.  Rather than providing a deep and rich background on Rommel's formative experiences growing up in southern Germany, with his siblings and family, at school, with personal relationships in the army, the company he kept during the Weimar years and so on, Fraser instead relies on clich&eacute;s and generalizations.  For instance, the book is over 550 pages long, yet by page 50 Rommel is already a gallant and increasingly renowned 26-year-old infantry officer on the Western Front.  The rest of the book reads like a military history with a central character, rather than a biography of a great man that happened to become a field marshal.  Fraser only mentions parenthetically that Rommel had two brothers and a sister, and his relationship with his parents is left totally unexplored, as are his religious beliefs (which is particularly disappointing given the fact that so many of his future letters to his [Catholic] wife Lucy are laced with references to God's will).  Instead, Fraser seems content to offer up his assessment that \\"Rommel was a Swabian [area of Germany he grew up in] through-and-through\\" (whatever that's supposed to mean) and then hurry on to the presumably more interesting topics of his later battlefield exploits.<br /><br />The above notwithstanding, Erwin Rommel is certainly a compelling subject for a full-length biography.  Especially interesting was his unusual relationship to the two things that made him famous: armored warfare and Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />To many, Rommel is synonymous with blitzkrieg and the genius of the Wehrmacht's combined arms doctrine developed during the interwar period.  Despite his association with the panzer force and his reputation for military genius, Rommel was an infantryman by training and was passed over for membership in Germany's elite General Staff system, a snub he never quite got over.  His first hands-on experience with armored units only came, unbelievably enough, as a divisional commander during the invasion of France in 1940.  He managed to pull off such an unlikely feat, Fraser suggests, thanks to the personal intervention of Hitler himself.<br /><br />Rommel's relationship with Hitler (and Goebbels) was close, although Fraser is adamant that Rommel was never a Nazi.  The field marshal clearly supported most of the regime's policies, felt the war was just and attributed Nazi excesses to the Furher's leading acolytes, such as Bormann and Himmler.  To Hitler, Rommel exemplified everything a German soldier ought to be: aggressive, courageous, indefatigable, and unpretentious.  In return, Rommel was genuinely impressed with Hitler's accomplishments and abilities.  It was a relationship based on mutual admiration that, strangely enough, ended with one being implicated in a plot to kill the other.  Fraser does an admirable job in reviewing and assessing the evidence tying Rommel to the failed 20 July attendat and comes to the conclusion that he likely knew that something was afoot, but wasn't an active conspirator.  Moreover, Fraser argues that by the summer of 1944 Rommel felt that a negotiated peace with the western allies was essential to save Germany from utter destruction, but that he also felt that the murder of Hitler was wrong and, if successfully carried out, was unlikely to be supported by the German army and people and thus unlikely to achieve its ultimate objectiveof negotiated peace.<br /><br />In closing, if you're looking for a fun and informative military history on one of the all-time greatest commanders, you'll likely enjoy \\"Knight's Cross.\\"  If, however, you're looking for a serious biography on a great commander in the mold of D'Este's biography of George Patton, for instance, you'll likely come away disappointed.of negotiated peace. <br /> <br />In closing, if you're looking for a fun and informative military history on one of the all-time greatest commanders, you'll likely enjoy \\"Knight's Cross.\\"  If, however, you're looking for a serious biography on a great commander in the mold of D'Este's biography of George Patton, for instance, you'll likely come away disappointed.   <br />	2005-07-01

If that is true, Martin van Creveld has written a book on logistics for armchair generals.<br /><br />Those familiar with military history and strategic studies are likely familiar with Van Creveld and his proclivity for making bombastic and sweeping assertions on the nature of warfare.  \\"Supplying War\\" is no exception.  (By way of example, he labels Operation Overlord \\"an exercise in logistic pusillanimity unparalleled in modern military history.\\")<br /><br />Originally published in 1976, \\"Supplying War\\" was the first book to directly address the critical, but often ignored issues of logistics in warfare with a primary objective of identifying key themes and trends across time.  Even Van Creveld's most trenchant critics - and he has many in the academic community - concede that his work was original and reached a large audience, and has therefore largely defined the debate on the subject.<br /><br />Van Creveld reviews seven historical case studies (17th century feudal warfare, Napoleon's invasion of Russia, the German invasion of France in 1870 and 1914, and Russia in 1940, Rommel's 1942 North African campaign and the Normandy invasion of 1944) and comes to the following general conclusion:  In pre-modern military history food (including animal fodder) was the primary logistical concern and most armies were forced to keep moving to survive by living off the land; but the rise of the modern, mechanized army inverted the paradigm, as ammunition and fuel supplies became paramount and armies were increasingly tied to rear-area depots for their survival.<br /><br />\\"Supplying War\\" is as interesting and easy to read as a book on such an inherently dull topic can be.  Given the broad impact the book has had serious students of military history will want to read it if only to understand Van Creveld's perspective and arguments.<br /><br />I would add, however, that no one should read \\"Supplying War\\" without also consulting the extremely thoughtful and hard-nosed critique of it written by John Lynn in \\"Feeding Mars: Logistics in Western Warfare from the Middle Ages to the Present.\\"  Lynn's essay points out a number of serious flaws in Van Creveld's approach and conclusions.  For instance, Lynn notes that Van Creveld conveniently avoids the issue of naval logistics, which happens to undermine his argument that military forces have only recently been engaged in serious logistical planning.  Unlike armies, from at least the time of the Spanish Armada navies have had to engage in sophisticated logistical planning to ensure they had enough food, water and ammunition to complete their mission, and with the arrival of steam power they had to worry about fuel as well.<br /><br />Lynn points out a number of other convenient omissions in Van Creveld's work, such as the successful use of railroads and steamboats for front-line supply in the US Civil War, the critical and successful role trans-Atlantic and -Pacific US logistics support played in both the First and Second World Wars, and the political constraints on 17th Century warfare that inhibited operations much more than logistical considerations.  However, the most convincing (and damning) scrutiny of \\"Supply War\\" comes in a section titled \\"A problem with numbers?\\" in which Lynn comes very close to accusing Van Creveld of intellectual and academic dishonesty by twisting or misrepresenting quantitative data on the purported rise of ammunition and fuel as a percentage of the overall supply requirements and the selective quotation of certain sources.<br /><br />In closing, add this book to your reading list, read it carefully and skeptically, consult Lynn's analysis closely and draw your own conclusions.t no one should read \\"Supplying War\\" without also consulting the extremely thoughtful and hard-nosed critique of it written by John Lynn in \\"Feeding Mars: Logistics in Western Warfare from the Middle Ages to the Present.\\"  Lynn's essay points out a number of serious flaws in Van Creveld's approach and conclusions.

The recent paperback release is nearly 600 hundred pages in length, but you'll be surprised how quickly the narrative moves.  Salisbury's chapters switch quickly and often from scenes of grand strategy at the Kremlin with Stalin to the everyday hazards of walking down Nevsky Prospekt during a heavy artillery barrage, which offers interesting contrasts and keeps the drama pulsing.<br /><br />On the other hand, the plight of the Leningrad population during the winter of 1941-42 so graphically told by Salisbury is agonizing to read.  I would often find myself grimacing and squirming in my chair as Salisbury told of half-starved children huddled around the frozen corpse of their mother in an unlit, unheated and bombed out Leningrad apartment building.  The physical, psychological and emotional toughness of the Russians is awe-inspiring.  Moreover, these were common citizens, mostly factory workers and intellectuals and a good many women and children, not highly trained, battle-hardened soldiers.  In mid-June they were lounging under trees on the banks of the Neva reading poetry.  Six-months later they were manning anti-aircraft guns and trying to live on 300 grams of bread a day in temperatures that regularly dipped to 40 degrees below zero.<br /><br />It should be noted that the title \\"The 900 Days\\" is a bit of a misnomer.  The siege of Leningrad did last just under 900 days (from September 1941 to January 1944), but the focus of this book is really the start of Operation Barbarossa (22 June 1941) through the first winter of the siege (March 1942).  Although there is a good deal of discussion on the military operations in defense of the city and many touching anecdotes of everyday life in the \\"city of death,\\" this book is neither a military history nor a complete social history of the siege.  The experience of the blockade is conveyed primarily from the perspective of the leading lights of the Leningrad intelligentsia: Vera Inber, Anna Ahkmatova, Olga Bergolts, and Vsevold Vishnesky.  They were poets, playwrights, journalists and composers - precisely the kinds of people most apt to leave the most enduring reminiscences of a horrific experience.<br /><br />It is hard to read books like \\"The 900 Days\\" (or Antony Beevor's \\"Stalingrad\\") and not feel that the primary credit for defeating Hitler rests with the Soviets.  I love my country and my fellow Americans, but I simply can't imagine one of our cities enduring an experience like Leningrad and holding out even for a couple of weeks, let alone years.  And through it all they kept not only their dignity, but also their appreciation for art and literature - throughout the siege the Leningrad central library never closed and was never empty.neither a military history nor a complete social history of the siege.

This book is more than an excellent history of a seminal but largely forgotten conflict; it is nothing less than a work of literary art and very much a piece of American history itself.<br /><br />Even if you have little interest in the Seven Years' War or the colonial-era in general, Parkman's writing alone is reason enough to put \\"Montcalm and Wolfe\\" on your reading list.  Here is one notable, but by no means unusual, example of Parkman's narrative abilities, which describes the journey of colonial troops through the marshes around Lake Oneida in upstate New York in 1755:<br /><br />\\"Thither the bateaux were dragged on sledges and launched on the dark and tortuous stream, which, fed by a decoction of forest leaves that oozed from the marshy shores, crept in shadow through depths of foliage, with only a belt of illumined sky gleaming between the jagged tree-tops.  Tall and lean with straining towards the light, their rough, gaunt stems trickling with perpetual damps, stood on either hand the silent hosts of the forest.  The skeletons of their dead, barkless, blanched and shattered, strewed the mudbanks and shallows; others lay submerged, like bones of drowned mammoths, thrusting lank, white limbs above the sullen water; and great trees, entire as yet, were flung by age or storms athwart the current - a bristling barricade of matted boughs.\\"<br /><br />Parkman's descriptions of Braddock's defeat on the Monongahela, the eviction of the Acadians, the siege of Louisbourg and the Battle of Quebec, to name just a few, are so vivid and intense that the images are seared into the reader's mind.  I had read about these events several times before, often by skilled historians, but reading Parkman is like being there.<br /><br />Parkman's work is built on exhaustive primary research and his extensive quotes from the personal letters of the leading figures on both sides of the conflict are fascinating and illuminating.  That said, his history is hardly objective.  To begin with, he is unabashedly Anti-Catholic.  With the exception of the nurse-nuns at Quebec, everyone associated with the Church in Canada is described as completely venal and manipulative.  In fact, he attributes much of the war - especially the barbarity of the French-Indian allies - to the actions of local priests, who in turn received tacit support from Versailles.  He also wears his anglophilia on his sleeve.  He spends much time and effort defending the British actions in displacing the entire Catholic population of Acadia in 1755: it was the priests that fostered opposition to allegiance to King George II; the British actions in Acadia went above-and-beyond to ensure the protection of religious freedom among the Acadians; all the British asked was neutrality; the Acadians themselves are described as simpletons easily manipulated by the French and priests; English settlers didn't appear in Acadia for five years \\"proving\\" that the British weren't motivated by a land grab; etc.<br /><br />One of the more interesting aspects of this non-PC approach is the portrayal of the Native-Americans on both sides.  Nearly all contemporary histories go out of their way, it seems, to take the rough edges off of Indian warfare and the result of raids on the frontier.  Parkman describes the tribes and their acts in graphic detail: scalping, torture, cannibalism, slavery, etc.  The reader gets a palpable sense of the fear an Indian war whoop must have instilled in colonists who no doubt had heard the stories of what happened to those sorry souls that fell into Indian hands.<br /><br />Finally, there are two basic types of characters in Parkman's writing: good guys and bad guys.  The former includes, above all, Montcalm and Wolfe, but also Lord Howe, Roger and his \\"Rangers,\\" and one other French general, Levi.  The latter group is led by the French Governor-General Vaudreiul and the knaves that supplied New France (especially Bigot and Pean) and represented by General Abercromby on the British side (he actually defends Braddock).<br /><br />In short, \\"Montcalm and Wolfe\\" is like reading history written by Saul Bellow.  It is one of the most important history books ever written in the English language and easily a classic of American military history.and one other French general, Levi.

The only more enduring name in strategic studies today is that of the Prussian master, Carl von Clausewitz.  Unfortunately, like Clausewitz, Mahan's work is rarely read in the original; instead, his ideas are summarized and conveyed in secondary sources or, worse still, in isolated quotes often extracted out of context and with the express purpose of defending a particular contemporary position.<br /><br />One might argue that personal interpretation is necessary when discussing Clausewitz.  He never published in his lifetime; his masterpiece \\"On War\\" was published posthumously.  The treatise was largely a rough draft and the main arguments were built using the theoretical construct of dialectical relationships, which, almost by definition, are open to debate.  Moreover, from the American perspective, Clausewitz wasn't translated into English (and not translated very well at that) until 1873, which remained the only English edition for nearly a century.  (For more on Clausewitz's reception in the English-speaking world and the transmogrification of his ideas see Christopher Bassford's authoritative \\"Clausewitz in English\\").<br /><br />For some reason, Mahan's magnum opus \\"The Influence of Seapower Upon History, 1660-1783\\" is approached in much the same way as Clausewitz even though it suffers from none of these interpretive handicaps (although both books are, admittedly, tough reads).  As anyone who has studied military strategy knows, Mahan and his theories have been distilled down to a few prescriptive policies or actions: the call for an all big ship navy; the positive attributes of imperialism; a focus on a decisive battle at sea; and, above all, the maxim \\"never divide the fleet!\\"<br /><br />In \\"Inventing Grand Strategy\\" the distinguished navalist Jon Sumida takes a full view of Mahan and his work, and puts particular focus on Mahan's thoughts on teaching and fostering naval command.  To begin with, \\"Influence\\" was merely the first of a three-part series, and just one of eighteen major pieces of history, biography and philosophy Mahan published over his lifetime.  In the twenty-five years after \\"Influence\\" first appeared, as Sumida demonstrates, Mahan refined his arguments and, in some cases, changed fundamental conclusions from his first work.  For instance, Mahan came to the conclusion that overseas trade was NOT a prerequisite to building a large navy and he came to doubt that a continental power like France or Russia could ever put the appropriate focus on seapower that an isolate island power like England, Japan and United States.<br /><br />In closing, this book is a real gem and should be read by anyone with an interest in seapower and strategy.  It provides great background and perspective on Mahan and his ideas, without being merely a redaction of \\"The Influence of Seapower Upon History.\\"n Mahan's thoughts on teaching and fostering naval command.

Isaacson traces Kissinger from his turbulent childhood in Nazi Germany, his formative years in the US Army during the Second World War and his storied tenure as a Harvard underclassman, graduate student and imperious young professor.  He presents Kissinger as undeniably brilliant yet completely insecure, callous and driven by unbridled ambition.  His ultimate success as an academic, a bureaucrat and a statesman were all attributable to an uncommon mix of exceptional talent, incredible hard-work and constant manipulation.<br /><br />Isaacson highlights Kissinger's academic focus on 19th century European diplomacy and attempts to show how the method and practice of Napoleonic era foreign secretaries such as Metternich directly influenced his behavior as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State.  His attempts to centralize power and decision-making across all facets of foreign policy result in some of the most entertaining pieces of the biography: Kissinger's bizarre relationship with his boss, Richard Nixon.  For instance, Isaacson tells how Kissinger always did his best to keep Nixon away from direct meetings with foreign leaders and diplomats, citing the president's \\"Walter Mitty tendencies\\" - as if the chief executive's desire to play an intimate role in his administration's foreign policy were ominous signs of delusions of grandeur.  He also describes how the totalitarian leadership in the Soviet Union and North Vietnam were often befuddled by the incessant use of back-channel contacts and covert diplomatic horse-trading proposed by Kissinger and the Nixon White House.  Finally, Isaacson's description of a maudlin Nixon begging Kissinger to kneel and pray with him in the White House on the eve of his resignation is simply unforgettable.<br /><br />In the end, the best description of Kissinger is the one Isaacson writes in the final pages of his biography: \\"...[Kissinger's] mixture of brilliance and abrasiveness, ego and insecurity, charm and furtiveness, humor and ambition had made him, for better and for worse, one of the premier stars of his era.\\"eve of his resignation is simply unforgettable.  <br /> <br />In the end, the best description of Kissinger is the one Isaacson writes in the final pages of his biography: \\"...[Kissinger's] mixture of brilliance and abrasiveness, ego and insecurity, charm and furtiveness, humor and ambition had made him, for better and for worse, one of the premier stars of his era.\\" <br />	2005-02-28

Unfortunately, the \\"Introduction\\" to Fred Anderson's \\"The Crucible of War\\" isn't among the pages prospective buyers can peruse online.  Reading this book is a delightful, but substantial undertaking.  Before starting this 750-page tome, do yourself a favor and carefully read the nine-page introduction to determine if this is really the book you want to read.<br /><br />First, let's be clear: this is NOT a military history of the French & Indian War.  Many of the tepid reviews below express frustration that Anderson didn't write the book they wanted or thought they were getting.  In fairness, the cover featuring Wolfe's heroic and idealized death on the Plains of Abraham and the quote from John Keegan claiming that Anderson's work compares favorably with Parkman's classic makes the issue more confusing for the potential reader.  But Anderson clearly lays out the primary motivation and objective in writing this book in the introduction - and it certainly isn't to write the definitive military history of the French & Indian War, let alone the larger Seven Years War, of which North America was but one (albeit central) battlefield.<br /><br />Rather, Anderson's objective is to place the events of the Seven Years' War in their proper historical perspective and, above all, to trace the enduring legacy of the wartime interaction between colonists and their ostensible countrymen: the British regular army, their officers and the Crown-appointed officials serving there.  The author notes that there has long been a vigorous debate in academia over the central motivation of the participants in the American Revolution (i.e. was it purely class-based materialism as argued by those of the so-called \\"progressive\\" school, or more idealism and commitment to republican principles at maintained by \\"neo-Whig\\" scholars?), but striking (and misleading) agreement on the Stamp Act of 1763 as the fundamental point of departure.  Anderson argues that this has obscured the importance and centrality of the Seven Years War in shaping the thoughts and actions of the colonies and Whitehall, alike, and ultimately leading to a war of independence that neither side originally sought nor wanted.  The 1760s were thus not the pre-revolutionary years that Americans think of them as, but rather \\"post-war\\" years.<br /><br />Anderson is a gifted historian and an enviable writer.  Few people could have written a history this rich, this authoritative and yet accessible.  If you approach the book as it was intended - a penetrating history of the seminal event of the eighteenth century and the social and economic consequences it wrought in America and England - you are sure to be more than satisfied.departure.

Not by years or even decades, but centuries.  In the 1830s he was an outspoken proponent of not just the abolition of slavery (many advocated various ways to deal with the South's \\"peculiar institution\\"), but called for the immediate abolition of slavery with complete and full civil rights for African-Americans.  He dreamed of a time when a black woman might succeed a black man as Secretary of State a decade before the Supreme Court ruled that blacks were something less than human in the infamous Dredd Scott decision.  He was also an early advocate of women's rights, labor reform, temperance and civil disobedience, as well as an outspoken critic of organized religion (Garrison was what we might today call a fundamentalist \\"born again Christian\\" who recognized no formal church other than Christ's teachings).<br /><br />Given Garrison's role as founding father of the abolitionist movement, his passion for the cause, longevity in leadership and terminal impact on the greatest political issue of the nineteenth century it is puzzling that he has left such an obscure historical legacy.  As author Herbert Mayer notes, Martin Luther King Jr. cited Gandhi, Thoreau and the Gospel as his inspiration and motivation in the Civil Rights movement with no reference to the man whose peaceful agitation did more to eradicate bondage than any other -- and who in turn may very well have been Thoreau's inspiration in writing \\"Civil Disobedience.\\"<br /><br />So why the obscurity?  Mayer's biography does little to address this paradox.  In fact, his book makes Garrison's general absence from the mainstream of American history all the more tenebrous.  The man that emerges from the pages of \\"All on Fire\\" is a moral giant, a crusader in the purest and best sense of the word, who risked -- indeed, welcomed -- verbal and physical abuse, a life of indigence and scorn, all in pursuit of a truly noble cause.  Garrison grew up in New England and never traveled further south than Baltimore until after the Civil War, yet he dedicated his life to the abolition of slavery with an intensity and zeal that surpassed dissident southern whites (such as the Grimke sisters) and even some blacks that had escaped from bondage themselves. Because of his central role in establishing and leading the cause, \\"All on Fire\\" is, as the full title suggests, as much a history of the entire abolitionist movement as it is a biography of its leading agitator.<br /><br />However, a close reading of \\"All on Fire\\" also reveals a hidden side of William Lloyd Garrison that Mayer, unfortunately, never fully explores: a man of extreme ambition, vanity, and conceit.  Garrison fought tenaciously to keep himself at the front-and-center of the moral movement he came to regard as his own.  One senses that the fame and notoriety he gained by his agitation came to mean quite a lot to him.  In this sense, Garrison reminds one of a contemporary political gadfly increasingly enamored of his high-profile image: Michael Moore.  Perhaps Garrison's attraction to celebrity never fully outweighed his commitment to the ultimate prize of freeing three million humans from bondage, but it certainly meant more than the pious Christian in him would have liked to admit -- and certainly more than biographer Mayer is willing to concede.  Again and again throughout the narrative Garrison experiences a painful and personal falling out with some of his closest friends and coadjutors: Frederick Douglas, Wendell Phillips, the Tappan brothers, etc.  And time after time Mayer attributes the rift to simple misunderstandings or the result of the stress and pressure of the times.  That Garrison might have been something less than the Galahad on ante-bellum America is left unexplored.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for anyone with a desire to know more about America and especially to learn about a man that was once one of the most controversial and well-known figures of his century, only to sink to near anonymity, this National Book Award finalist can be highly recommended.y, this National Book Award finalist can be highly recommended.	2005-01-06

But veteran author Erik Larson succeeds in writing a history able enough to be recognized by the National Book Award and interesting enough to garner national bestseller status; a rare achievement, indeed.<br /><br />The book succeeds for two reasons.  First, the story is incredible.  The fact that the gruesome activities of Dr. Holmes has remained relatively obscure all these years in a society that maintains a perverse fascination with the macabre is nothing short of amazing.  Second, the author skillfully intertwines the stories of the Fair - its sponsors, architects, builders, vendors and performers - with that of a city on the rise and quite sensitive to its newcomer, provincial status and the heinous activities of one of its residents.  That the author is able to juggle so many characters and different story lines while maintaining an easy flow and cohesion to the narrative is an impressive achievement.  And because the story of the Fair and Holmes are not well known, Larson is able to build suspense throughout: when and how will Holmes get caught?  Will he get caught?  Will the Fair be finished on time?  What will they do to match the Eiffel Tower, the centerpiece of the recently held Paris World Fair?  The author uses foreshadowing expertly and draws the reader in the way few works of history can.<br /><br />In closing, I should note that one of the more puzzling aspects of the book is the near absence of photographs.  Given the sundry characters and the strong focus on the architectural design of the Fair grounds and buildings a composite of pictures would have been most helpful and interesting, but there are only about four in the whole book.  Nevertheless, this is a book for just about everyone and a real joy to read, albeit a bit frustratingly addictive.	2004-11-29

Most educated people have heard the name, but few know anything about the man beyond, perhaps, that he proclaimed, \\"I have not yet begun to fight!\\"  Much to my surprise, after reading this classic biography (winner of the 1960 Pulitzer Prize for Biography) by Samuel Eliot Morison, the godfather of US Naval history, Jones' exploits are both relatively unknown and relatively modest.  There is, however, nothing relative or modest about Morison's biography, which is an excellently structured and wonderfully written piece of history that is a pleasure to read.<br /><br />How did Jones attain immortality for his role in the American Revolution while other leading military figures of the period (most notably, in this reviewer's opinion, General Nathaniel Greene) have nearly vanished from history?  Jones' attachment to the United States, both as a nation and a cause, were slight, even dubious.  He was born and raised in Scotland and didn't arrive in America until roughly 1775 (on the run from a murder trial, no less, which also prompted him to add the alias \\"Jones\\" to his birth name of John Paul).  He never owned a home or even maintained a permanent resistance in his adopted land, and instead lived with friends or at hotels at government expense.  During his forty-five years of life, Jones only spent about three of them on American soil -- and that time was divided among four brief visits.  His commitment to the principles of the American Revolution are a bit suspect, although he did frequently claim to be a citizen of the world engaged in the fight for liberty.  Nevertheless, when Catherine II of Imperial Russia, the ruler of the most despotic of European monarchies, dangled a much coveted flag officer position before him in 1788 Jones quickly jettisoned his liberal pretensions and jumped at the offer.<br /><br />If Jones lacked the deep American roots of a John Adams or the strong ideological convictions of more recent immigrants like Thomas Paine, he was at least a military hero, right?  Well, sort of.  Jones' major military exploits during the war can be summarized as follows: a partially successful raid on his hometown port of Whitehaven, Scotland followed by a botched kidnapping attempt and then the capture of a modest-sized British warship while cruising the Irish Sea aboard \\"Ranger\\" in 1778, and then the famous defeat of the \\"Serapis\\" off Flamborough Head in September 1779 aboard the \\"Bonhomme Richard.\\"  Like Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo in 1942, the military value of these actions were minimal, but the psychological impact -- both at home and with the enemy -- was enormous.  The British home islands had, afterall, been inviolable since a Dutch raid in 1667.  Thus, Jones stands alone as the man who brought the American Revolution home to the British Isles, albeit in a way that caused little material damage.<br /><br />So, through a combination of moxie, luck and the general absence of anything else to cheer about, John Paul Jones -- one-time slave trader, murderer, Imperial Russian admiral, and alleged rapist of a 12-year-old (in his defense he swore, foreshadowing a future American scandal, that he \\"did not have sexual relations with that [girl],\\" although conceded that other amorous relations did occur) -- emerged as a bona fide hero of the American Revolution.  Jones died alone, indigent and forgotten in Paris in 1792.  But today his remains rest in an ornate tomb (modeled on Napoleon's) at the US Naval Academy and he is widely regarded as the father of the US Navy, which has become the global juggernaut he dreamed it would be.<br /><br />In closing, Morison does a remarkable job in capturing not only the essence of his subject-- Jones' native intelligence, egotism, insecurity and opportunism -- but also the pulse of life on the open ocean in an eighteenth century sailing vessel.  The skill, experience, fortitude, and endurance it must have taken to guide these ships in battle and in treacherous seas with a motley collection of mutiny-inclined men as a crew is difficult to fathom.  That Jones did so with such obvious success is, indeed, impressive.  For readers with an interest in naval affairs or simply a love of sailing, this book would be a welcome addition to your library.t have taken to guide these ships in battle and in treacherous seas with a motley collection of mutiny-inclined men as a crew is difficult to fathom.

Rawson	There are many able and thoughtful reviews of this bestseller below.  Rather than rehash the common themes -- namely that \\"Cicero\\" is well-written but a bit shallow (I happen to agree) -- I've decided to use this review to assess Everitt's work against the last popular biography on the great Roman statesman and philosopher, Elizabeth Rawson's \\"Cicero: A Portrait,\\" which is regarded by many Roman scholars as the finest ever written.  With diligence and a little bit of luck I was able to obtain a copy of Rawson on the Internet.  I decided to read the two books concurrently to discover why many learned readers hold her book in so much higher regard than Everitt's.<br /><br />Keeping with the spirit of a head-to-head competition, first let us consider the \\"tale of the tape.\\"  The paperback versions of both books are remarkably similar is structure, organization and length.  That is, both are chronological narratives organized into seventeen chapters and just over 300 pages in length (it should be noted that the font and margins in Rawson are smaller, so \\"Portrait\\" is roughly 20% longer in terms of wordcount).  Clearly, then, Everitt's relative weakness isn't excessive brevity or an unorthodox and ineffective approach to Cicero's life.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, these books turned out to be just as similar in content as they were in size.  Rawson certainly does a more thorough job of analyzing Cicero's philosophical works and her book ends with an excellent but brief review of Cicero's legacy, but overall Everitt's prose is more lucid and he excels Rawson in his ability to capture the pulse of life in Republican Rome (his descriptions of the traditional Roman marriage ceremony and assembly voting procedures are especially noteworthy).  Rawson doesn't quote from Cicero's writings or letters to Atticus any more extensively than Everitt -- indeed, Everitt's choice of quotes are so precisely similar to Rawson's that it almost raises some suspicions.  In sum, because these books are so close in every way I feel that Everitt's is superior simply because it is more readable (not to mention far easier to find and purchase).<br /><br />In closing, I'd like to echo the frequent comment that this book isn't a deep and penetrating study of Cicero and his times, such as Meier's biography of Caesar.  It wasn't meant to be.  It is targeted to a wide audience and succeeds exceptionally well at bringing Rome and one of its most remarkable figures to the average reader.  In a world where many of the liberal arts graduates of our leading universities never touch Cicero or Polybius or Livy or Thucydides and probably couldn't tell you whether the Greeks or Romans came first, I can't help but think that books like this are at least a step in the right direction toward stimulating public interest in the classics.  Ideally, \\"Cicero\\" will inspire young students or the merely intellectually curious to read some of Cicero's writings or pursue more substantial works on the Republican Rome or the ancient world in general.  As someone who didn't \\"discover\\" the ancients until graduate school and then developed a passion for them, I can only hope that books like this will make a few converts along the way.these books are so close in every way I feel that Everitt's is superior simply because it is more readable (not to mention far easier to find and purchase). <br /> <br />In closing, I'd like to echo the frequent comment that this book isn't a deep and penetrating study of Cicero and his times, such as Meier's biography of Caesar.

With an impressive attention to detail and exhaustive primary research, Mahnken demonstrates that the US attach&eacute; corps was better funded, better manned and better managed than most other major powers during that time.  And far from being the career backwater it has often been depicted as, he shows that most of the officers assigned to the attach&eacute; corps were quite skilled and more than competent at their mission, with many of the services' top talents - such as Spruance, Halsey, Pershing, and March - having served in their ranks.<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly, Mahnken concludes that military intelligence was, on balance, successful in identifying, analyzing and correctly assessing the implications of new technology and innovative doctrine.  For instance, Japanese amphibious vehicle design directly influenced the Marine Corps development of a similar craft, while German combined arms armored doctrine was recognized as revolutionary far before the Wehrmacht's stunning victories in 1939-1940.  In short, the notion that the US armed forces were poorly informed on the dramatic changes to military equipment and operations that had developed since the First World War needs to be fundamentally reassessed in light of the findings clearly laid-out in this book.<br /><br />From a practical perspective, &#34;Uncovering Ways of War&#34; makes a critical examination of the US intelligence agencies' &#34;mixed record&#34; during the interwar period and looks for clues to help uncover how and why the attaches succeeded in some cases and failed in others.  For example, why was US intelligence able to accurately (and independently) track and assess British and German armored warfare doctrine, yet completely miss other important innovations such as the British development of radar and German advances in rocketry?  Mahnken concludes that intelligence organizations are severely handicapped in their ability to detect concepts that have been ignored or already rejected by their own militaries or have yet to be employed successfully in combat or realistic war game maneuvers.  However, when it comes to concepts or technologies that their parent services are actively pursuing, the intelligence apparatus has a remarkable track record of success.<br /><br />As someone with an education and passion for strategic studies who has spent most of their career in strategy and analysis positions in a Fortune 500 software company, this book appealed to me on both a personal and professional level.  The interwar period has long been recognized as the ultimate case study in the rapid and discontinuous change that can occur when military forces meld new technology into new organizations with an entirely new way of fighting.  The fact that Mahnken has made such a dramatic and credible revision to the history of a period that has been so thoroughly researched is laudable and, indeed, impressive.  As a practitioner of competitive strategy and analysis, I can attest to the fact that many of the insights the author uncovers are directly applicable to the private sector.  The time-cycles in industry - especially information technology - are dramatically shorter and the nature and gravity of the competition is, needless to say, quite different; however, the framework of theorizing, experimenting and implementing new concepts or technologies is very similar.  It is unfortunate that most people in strategy and analysis roles in industry avoid or are completely ignorant of books like this and others (&#34;The Tet Offensive: Intelligence Failure in War&#34; by James Wirtz is another excellent and highly relevant work in the Cornell series that is well worth reading).  There is much to be learned from the experience - both positive and negative - of government and military intelligence and planning agencies throughout history as &#34;Uncovering Ways of War&#34; lucidly demonstrates.eople in strategy and analysis roles in industry avoid or are completely ignorant of books like this and others (&#34;The Tet Offensive: Intelligence Failure in War&#34; by James Wirtz is another excellent and highly relevant work in the Cornell series that is well worth reading).

US	49916018	R3GMH9C4PHFZD	0520201531	629797028	The Last Generation of the Roman Republic	Books	4	65	66	N	N	Sweeping revisionism	This impressive history isn't for everyone.  In fact, it is targeted to a rather select audience: those with a deep understanding of the Age of Cicero.  If you are not intimately familiar with the chronology and the \\"conventional wisdom\\" explaining the demise of the Roman Republic much of Gruen's work will be impenetrable and the gravity of his conclusions will be lost.<br /><br />The author's thesis is simple: all previous secondary histories of the era are contaminated by a heavy reliance on the overblown rhetoric of a few ancient authors and a strong tendency to view the events of the period from the enlightened vantage point of the future.  Gruen claims that an objective and dispassionate review of the period with no attempt to divine patterns of demise will show that the 70s, 60s, and 50s BC were largely business as usual.  Whereas modern authors have described the last decades of the Republic as leading inexorably to civil war and revolution, Gruen claims that a Roman of that period would not have seen things that way.<br /><br />Gruen doesn't limit his challenge to the traditional orthodoxy to a few examples.  Rather, his revisionism is sweeping in scope.  For instance, Gruen argues: 1) what has generally been construed as the moral rot of the last few decades was actually a common theme in Greek and Roman literature not confined to the Age of Cicero; 2) the ruling oligarchy did desperately cling to power as is often argued, but that didn't prevent a robust although non-interconnected string of reform legislation from being introduced throughout the period; 3) Republican Rome was dominated by individuals and small groups from its inception and a close review of the electoral returns at all levels show that the last years of the Republic show no major departure from precedent; 4) there is no evidence to suggest that the evaporation of the middle class led to a large and unified disgruntled constituency of urban poor bent on social revolution; 5) the armies of the Late Republic were no more \\"professional\\" or beholden to individuals than was usually the case (it should be noted that I found Gruen's evidence in this particular case to be exiguous and far from convincing); 6) Rome's system of imperial administration may have been undeveloped and exploitative, but that does nothing to explain the collapse of the Republic as the provinces stayed loyal to Rome before, during and after the Civil War; and 7) there has been far too much focus on the explanations proffered by Cicero and Sallust, whose work was largely the result of personal gripes and set forth for propaganda purposes.  In other words, Gruen addresses and attempts to refute every commonly held belief on the decline and fall of the Republic.  In some cases he makes a convincing case (challenging the notion that the Triumvirate utterly dominated the Republic from the 59 BC forward is one good example), while others appear to be more of a stretch (the aforementioned argument of the changing nature of the army is most notable is that regard).<br /><br />In closing, \\"The Last Generation of the Roman Republic\\" is one of the most important and influential scholarly works on the period to appear in the past half-century.  However, the book is not without its credible critics.  One prime example would be the highly critical review by Michael Crawford (\\"Hamlet without the Prince\\" The Journal of Roman Studies Vol. 66 (1976) pp. 214-217), which this reviewer would suggest that all prospective readers consult.c were no more \\"professional\\" or beholden to individuals than was usually the case (it should be noted that I found Gruen's evidence in this particular case to be exiguous and far from convincing); 6) Rome's system of imperial administration may have been undeveloped and exploitative, but that does nothing to explain the collapse of the Republic as the provinces stayed loyal to Rome before, during and after the Civil War; and 7) there has been far too much focus on the explanations proffered by Cicero and Sallust, whose work was largely the result of personal gripes and set forth for propaganda purposes.

Employing a style and approach highly reminiscent of such bestsellers as David Fromkin's &#34;A Peace to End All Peace&#34; or Robert Massie's &#34;Dreadnought,&#34; Hopkirk uses a number of harrowing expeditions by young, intrepid (and mostly British) army officers and diplomats to convey the drama, intrigue and danger of the imperial contest that Rudyard Kipling christened &#34;The Great Game.&#34;<br /><br />A quick word of caution: this book isn't really a primer on current events in Afghanistan and the surrounding areas.  I mention that because there are some exerts to that effect on the cover of the new paperback and I suspect that angle has been pushed by the publishers to promote sales.  Yes, there are some graphic tales of western forces being mutilated by Muslim mobs incited by the harangues of mullahs in Kabul and other now familiar cities, but that is where the potential similarities end.  In short, this is a book about nineteenth century imperial competition; Islam in general and Afghanistan in particular are elements of that story, not the focus.  It is told primarily from the British perspective and focuses on their century-long cold war with imperial Russia.  The borders of their global empires became, in London's opinion, uncomfortable close in the mid-1800s as Moscow's borders expanded inexorably southwards in search of new economic markets and trade routes until they encroached upon the mountain passes to northern India, thus threatening the &#34;crown jewel&#34; of the British Empire.  For over a hundred years the British worked to parry this threat, oscillating between a proactive policy of military presence in Persia, Afghanistan and elsewhere (known as &#34;the forward school&#34; and leading to three wars) and the withdrawn, passive defense of India (derisively dubbed &#34;masterly inactivity&#34;).<br /><br />I found two things to be particularly remarkable in this tale.  First, it is difficult to underestimate just how little the British and Russians knew about the inhabitants and topography that filled the critical buffer zone between their two great empires.  It would be no exaggeration to claim that we know more today about the surface of Mars than British knew about the Pamir region north of Kashmir in the late nineteenth century.  Second, most of the leading characters that explored and charted these unknown areas for their respective governments were in their mid-twenties at the time of their heroic missions.  Few episodes of international grand strategy and policy have been so directly shaped by the deeds of such young men.<br /><br />A number of modern historians have dismissed the threat that imperial Russian expansion presented to India, but Hopkirk asserts that the challenge was genuine and the British response reasoned and legitimate.  In the process, one can't help but get the impression that after long years of close study, the author has concluded that the &#34;forward school&#34; was the correct one, his specific claims to be non-judgmental notwithstanding.s) and the withdrawn, passive defense of India (derisively dubbed &#34;masterly inactivity&#34;).

Clearly written, passionate and authoritative, this book is a shining example that objective and powerful history can be written on &#34;current events&#34; (the book was first published barely a decade after the French pulled out of Algeria).<br /><br />As the US-led coalition in Iraq struggles to impose order, comparisons with France's ultimately unsuccessful attempt at holding on to Algeria in the face of Islamic insurgents have become fashionable.  Such analogies, however, should be used cautiously.  There are a number of salient differences in the two cases.  None looms larger than the relatively large and vocal pied noir community in Algeria that Paris had to contend with, first politically and then militarily.  In some Algerian cities in the 1950s, such as Constantine, a majority of the residents were of European extraction (although not necessarily French).  These pied noirs had roots in Algeria for generations and had a powerful lobby in Paris.  A simple political withdrawal from Algeria in 1955 was thus (in my opinion) a political impossibility.  The ugly war that erupted was, in the end, tragically unavoidable.<br /><br />Horne would certainly disagree with this assessment.  Myopic intransigence by the French and pied noir leaders is a leitmotif of the narrative. Yet, the author just as consistently praises the FLN leadership for laying out their aims at the 1956 Soumman Conferences and never wavering from them.  Algerian inflexibility, it seems, was a virtue; for the French/pied noir community it was a sin.<br /><br />There is so much to praise in Horne's work (the minor disagreement above notwithstanding) that no review, no matter how flattering, will fully do it justice.  If you are student of military history or have a keen interest in colonial / counter-insurgency conflict, &#34;A Savage War of Peace&#34; is as good as it gets.  Unfortunately, this book is no longer in print, so you may have to scour used bookstores and various online resources to obtain a copy, but it is worth the effort.

Author George Crile delivers a compulsively readable and endlessly intriguing narrative of the CIA covert operation - the &#34;largest and most successful covert operation ever&#34; he incessantly reminds us - in support of the Afghan Mujahideen in the early- and mid-1980s.<br /><br />On one level, this book is phenomenal.  It is entertaining without end.  The characters are so eccentric and their activities so pregnant with danger and political scandal that it almost stretches the bounds of believability.  Tom Hanks, that most venerable of Hollywood icons, has purchased the screen rights to this book and plans to play the lead.  For once, screenwriters won't have to &#34;punch up&#34; the script to appeal to the mainstream audience (although they still might try).<br /><br />But that brings us to the other, more disappointing side of &#34;Charlie Wilson's War.&#34;  It is written in the spirit of a great spy novel, rather than the most exciting history imaginable.  The topic is historical and the events described by Crile are all ostensibly historical in nature, but this book isn't &#34;history.&#34;  Stellar works of modern history - such as Alistair Horne's &#34;A Savage War of Peace&#34; or Stanley Karnow's &#34;Vietnam&#34; - are informative, engaging but above all objective.  Grand characters may populate the narrative and some may come off better than others, but ultimately the story tells itself and the reader is left to draw their own conclusions and character analysis.  This isn't the case with &#34;Charlie Wilson's War.&#34;  It comes replete with heroes (Charlie Wilson and Gust Avrakotos and a small handful of those who directly supported them) and dastardly villains (essentially everyone else who wasn't a Wilson/Avrakotos partisan).  Both Congressmen Wilson and CIA operative Avrakotos are deeply flawed men, which normally would make them even more compelling heroes.  But in Crile's telling they become Galahads in a sea of bureaucratic and political ineptitude.  Sure, Crile writes, Avrakotos might be rough around the edges and has a tendency to unleash expletive laced tirades at superiors, but the way he tells the story you can't help but feel the &#34;elitist cake eater&#34; deserved it.  Zia ul Haq, the Pakistani totalitarian military dictator and key Wilson/Avrakotos ally appears to more closely resemble Ghandi than, well, a totalitarian military dictator.  And so on and so forth.<br /><br />Crile's tendentious style is often shocking and (in my opinion) completely undermines the case he is trying to make.  For instance, it isn't uncommon for Crile to introduce a new character as a &#34;scum ball&#34; or a &#34;whacko.&#34;  On several occasions I had to double-check what I was reading.  &#34;He must be quoting Avrakotos here&#34; I'd muse.  But no, the author (and editors) for some reason decided to introduce factual characters with acerbic name-calling.  Bizarre.<br /><br />I have no doubt that Charlie Wilson and Gust Avrakotos played a central role - perhaps the predominant role - in developing and supporting this &#34;the largest and most successful covert operation and history,&#34; but there are many other sides to this story, I'm sure.  The people that Wilson/Avrakotos/Crile essentially describes as all wrong couldn't possibly be, in fact, &#34;all wrong.&#34;  He does a disservice to Wilson's and Avrakotos' efforts by desribing them is such roseate terms while slandering everyone else.deeply flawed men, which normally would make them even more compelling heroes.

There are scores of popular histories and biographies on Caesar and the Roman Revolution - the commercial success of Anthony Everitt's &#34;Cicero&#34; is but one recent example - but the epoch that set the republic wobbling on its foundation and offered the precedent for Caesar's march on Rome has been largely ignored in popular history until now.<br /><br />The author does a superb job of framing the issue by first providing an outline of the development of the Roman state with a particular focus on the army and the role it played socially and politically.  Hildinger then provides a good general overview of the central figures and events of the period (the Gracchi, Marius and Sulla and the Jurgurthan, Cimbrian/Teuton, Social, Mithridatic and First Civil Wars) as related in the works of Appian, Sallust and Plutarch.  There is no critical examination of the sources or revisionism to the traditional account of the events, such as the ones Badian provides in the article cited above.<br /><br />In closing, if you are new to the subject and are looking for a crisp overview of this extremely important period preceding the rise of Caesar and the triumvirate &#34;Swords Against the Senate&#34; is highly recommended.  If you are a rather serious student of Republican Rome (i.e. you've read all the ancient authors; you're familiar with the major arguments and works of Brunt, Badian, Gruen, Millar and Syme; you read the Journal of Roman Studies on occasion) there isn't much in this account that will inform, interest or challenge you.n Studies on occasion) there isn't much in this account that will inform, interest or challenge you.	2004-03-19
US	49916018	R2JHSJVY6LCRYW	0060084332	270759759	The Myth of the Great War: A New Military History of World War I	Books	3	23	27	N	N	Allied intelligence failure in the First World War	This is a difficult book to review.  On the one hand, it offers some interesting revisionist arguments and conclusions on the nature of the First World War and some keen insights into specific tactical issues.  On the other hand, the author seems to needlessly stretch a couple of specific arguments into a full-length narrative of the conflict, which wasn't necessary and actually dilutes the impact of his case.<br /><br />Mosier's central thesis is somewhat unique and worthy of deeper examination.  In short, this book is all about allied intelligence failure; more specifically, he argues, the Allies couldn't accurately count the German war dead.  Mosier's case goes something like this: the Allied High Command sincerely believed that they were killing many more Germans in their attacks and bombardments than they were losing themselves (the reverse, of course, was true).  Because they thought their attacks were succeeding in bleeding the Germans white -- to apply the German philosophy of Verdun -- the allies didn't believe innovation on the Western Front was necessary.  Moreover, Mosier says, when it came to things they could count, they counted the wrong things.  For example, they religiously tabulated and compared relative manpower, but not heavy artillery, which he argues was the decisive force on the western front.<br /><br />His conclusions on the overestimation of allied killing power, however, raise some other sticky questions.  For instance, had the allies known the truth about how badly they were losing the body count, would they have sued for peace on terms favorable to the Germans in, say, 1915?  How do we know that tactical innovation would have been the response rather than capitulation, especially if the reality of the situation had been known before Lloyd George took over the British government in December 1916?<br /><br />Mosier concludes that it was American money, men and material that saved the British and French from the consequences of their incompetence.  His assessment of American combat performance on the Western Front is therefore generally more favorable than that depicted in most histories of the conflict and, in my opinion, is suspect.<br /><br />In closing, this book is difficult to recommend to anyone.  The overview on allied versus German artillery is excellent and Mosier's focus on an often-overlooked German command (von Mudra) is interesting, but overall this book fails to satisfy.of American combat performance on the Western Front is therefore generally more favorable than that depicted in most histories of the conflict and, in my opinion, is suspect.

Briskly-paced and engaging, &#34;In Our Image&#34; won the 1990 Pulitzer-prize for history and presents a balanced, yet sobering perspective on America's only traditional colonial experience.<br /><br />Those looking for anti-American or anti-imperialist fodder will be sorely disappointed by Karnow's generally positive assessment of US policies in the archipelago.  He praises the massive investment made in developing and improving the indigenous education system and industrial infrastructure, and frequently notes that American policies were far less exploitative and more politically liberal than any other colonial administration in history.  Indeed, he argues that the Washington's voluntary grant of independence to the Philippines was nothing short of revolutionary at the time, and that the islands were actually more subject to American domination after independence in 1946 than before.<br /><br />On the other hand, those seeking inspiration in how American democracy and industry can be successfully exported to different cultures will be equally disappointed with this case study.  Most politicians today, liberal and conservative alike, bristle at the notion that some people or cultures are simply incapable of American-style democracy, and the freedom and justice that comes with it.  Karnow, however, makes a strong case that dreams of self-duplication in the Philippines were doomed to fail in a society with an entrenched oligarchy, a powerful tradition of compadre loyalty, and an inherent respect for unabridged power.  He notes, for instance, that both Marcos and his prime political opponent, the martyred Benigno Aquino, believed that only an all-powerful head of state in the mold of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew or South Korea's Syngman Rhee would be capable of making any positive difference in the Philippines.<br /><br />Karnow is a brilliant writer and this book shows him at his best.  Each chapter covers large swaths of American and Filipino history, so the narrative is far from comprehensive.  Those seeking a detailed understanding of US colonial administration, the bloody and controversial fight against Aquinaldo and the Filipino insurgents, or the epic tale of the Bataan death march and MacArthur's reconquest of the Philippines would be well-advised to seek other, more focused works.  However, for an introduction to the political history of the Philippines, her close and unusual relationship with the United States, and the experience of re-creating American institutions in lands unlike our own, this book is not to be missed.l-powerful head of state in the mold of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew or South Korea's Syngman Rhee would be capable of making any positive difference in the Philippines.

In the late 1950s, JFK was a freshman senator without many notable achievements.  \\"Profiles\\" immediately set him apart from his Congressional colleagues and established him as something of an intellectual heavyweight in Washington and garnered valuable publicity that ultimately vaulted him to the 1960 Democratic nomination and the presidency.<br /><br />Second, never before has a work of non-fiction been so immediately embroiled in controversy, both because of questions concerning its composition and the fact that it won the 1957 Pulitzer Prize for biography.  The consensus today -- nearly half-a-century after its publication and after intense scrutiny -- is that the book was essentially written by committee.  JFK may have provided the inspiration for the work, but close aide and confidant Ted Sorensen did most of the heavy lifting around research and writing.  In other words, Kennedy was more the \\"editor\\" than the \\"author.\\"  Indeed, Herbert Parmet investigated the \\"who wrote Profiles?\\" question in detail in his 1980 book \\"Jack: The Struggle of John F. Kennedy\\" and concluded that there was no evidence from reams of hand-written notes and memos that JFK contributed anything substantial to the final version of the book.  This after Kennedy threatened to sue ABC for millions after syndicated columnist Drew Pearson alleged that the book was ghostwritten during a 1957 appearance on the Mike Wallace Show, an allegation ABC was forced to retract.  To add to the brouhaha, the Pulitzer committee never officially nominated \\"Profiles\\" in 1957, yet somehow it came away with the award.  Rumors swirled that Joseph Kennedy - and good friend and New York Times columnist Arthur Krock - leaned on the committee to get JFK the award, but those charges have never been, nor likely ever will be, verified.<br /><br />Finally, the book is rare and important because of its content and theme.  Contrary to other reviews, this book is NOT about \\"doing the right thing.\\"  The author(s) stress that each vignette concerns Senators who deliberately took a stand of conscience, which they knew would be unpopular with their constituents and likely cripple their political careers.  Their stories have nothing to do with being right in time.  Indeed, was Webster \\"doing the right thing\\" when he pursued compromise in 1850, including acceptance of the hated Fugitive Slave Law, which so appalled abolitionist Massachusetts?  Was Norris right for scuttling Wilson's attempts to arm the American merchant fleet that was being decimated by German U-Boats before the US entry into the First World War?  The central issue is the willingness to accept malicious public abuse, the loss of friends, power, prestige and the sacrifice of future aspirations on an issue of moral conscience, regardless how posterity judges that particular position.  Kennedy et.al. demonstrate the admirable virtue of political courage through a collection of historical anecdotes of senators - some legends (Webster) and others forgotten (Ross) - across the expanse of US history.<br /><br />The profiles are all crisp, lively and engaging (kudos to Sorensen!).  Each is inspiring in its own way without resorting to mawkishness sentimentality.  However, one should be cautioned from fully embracing each story in its entirety.  For instance, the author(s) credit Kansas Senator Edmund G. Ross with single-handedly casting the vote that acquitted Andrew Johnson from impeachment charges in 1868, thus saving the executive from gross encroachment by the legislative branch.  Some noted historians of the era, such as Eric Foner, note that there were a number of acquittal votes waiting in the wings to ensure that Johnson was not thrown out of office and that Ross ultimately received a number of patronage posts from the president in return for his vote, therefore undermining the notion in \\"Profiles\\" that Ross' actions was purely selfless and in the interest of the nation.<br /><br />In sum, \\"Profiles in Courage\\" is a highly readable collection of anecdotes from Senatorial history with a positive, inspiring theme - regardless who wrote the book.osts from the president in return for his vote, therefore undermining the notion in \\"Profiles\\" that Ross' actions was purely selfless and in the interest of the nation.

Derived from his popular undergraduate class at Yale, the book uses an eclectic mix of great power case studies to illuminate the importance of actively and energetically working to maintain great power peace is an international system that is inherently unstable and competitive.<br />Kagan's basic thesis is that war is a natural component of human society.  Moreover, wars are just as likely to arise over intangible issues such as prestige, power, respect and honor as they are over more tangible concerns like land and natural resources.  He demonstrates that attempts to avoid war through unilateral disarmament and conciliation -- although well intentioned -- are ultimately chimerical and doomed to failure.  Kagan notes that many wars may be &quot;unnecessary&quot; and therefore avoidable, but war as an instrument of policy and change is permanent.  Thus, the objective of statesmen should be to fight only those wars that are necessary, while maintaining a strong and credible defense to keep the peace.  As Kagan writes &quot;the preservation of peace requires active effort, planning, the expenditure of resources, and sacrifice, just as war does.&quot;<br />As for the individual case studies, I found them to be a bit longer than necessary, but each one was well-crafted and powerfully argued.  The book does assume a certain familiarity with the subject matter, so the content may be a little overwhelming for those less-steeped in military history or foreign affairs.<br />The chapter on the causes of the Peloponnesian War is a gem, but essentially a synopsis of Kagan's seminal work in that area.  The piece on the origins of the First World War is forcefully argued and long enough to stand on its own as a monograph on that much-debated historical case study.  Kagan revives the classic argument that the perceived ambiguity of a British response to a German invasion of Belgium and France is what set the stage for war, with the author arguing that war could have been avoided if London made their commitment to defend the Low Country clear and by introducing peace-time conscription to field a credible European land army.  The chapter on the Second Punic War is crisp and compelling; that on the Second World War too long (he again blames the British for doing the most to &quot;lose the peace&quot;).  The last case study was a bit surprising in that Kagan takes a classic diplomatic &quot;success story&quot; and lumps it in the same category as classic blunders like August 1914.  In short, he argues that Kennedy's many mistakes, attempts at conciliation, and failure to understand his adversary is what put him in the crisis in the first place.  Kagan contends that Kennedy was inclined to accept missiles in Cuba and it was only because of a coterie of strong-willed advisors, upcoming mid-term elections that threatened to overturn his slight Democratic edge in Congress, and a genuine fear of impeachment that compelled him to act.  And the resolution of the conflict only came at the expense of the US removing missiles from Turkey in a quid pro quo with the Soviets.<br />The case studies, which focused exclusively on conflict between great powers and/or their alliance systems, don't apply to the current War on Terror, but the general thesis that tough decisions and sacrifice are required for larger catastrophes to be avoided is still valid and directly applicable.  Whether you are a serious student of war and peace, or are simply looking to gain some insights into such issues, you'd be well-advised to put this book on your reading list.German invasion of Belgium and France is what set the stage for war, with the author arguing that war could have been avoided if London made their commitment to defend the Low Country clear and by introducing peace-time conscription to field a credible European land army.

On another, more important level, it is a thoughtful analysis of the classic Clausewitzean dictum that &#34;war is politics by other means,&#34; which has implications far beyond the air campaigns against North Vietnam.<br /><br />Clodfelter uses a simple, but effective framework to examine political efficacy of three major air campaigns against North Vietnam: Rolling Thunder (March '65 to October '68), Linebacker I (April '72 to October '72), and Linebacker II (December '72).  For each campaign, he assesses to what extent the bombing helped achieve the civilian leadership's &#34;positive political objective&#34; (i.e. what political purpose the US was trying to achieve by the use of force).  At the same time, he identifies and assesses the various &#34;negative political objectives&#34; that put constraints on the use of force (i.e. what political purposes were endangered or aggravated by the use of force).  Finally, he considers other factors that could constrain the use and effectiveness of air power, such as doctrine, weather, technology, personnel, etc.<br /><br />The author's conclusions are persuasive, although not exactly groundbreaking in their originality.  In short, Clodfelter argues that Linebacker II (aka &#34;Christmas Bombings&#34;or &#34;Eleven Day War&#34;) was a more effective political tool not because air power was finally unleashed with a fury against Hanoi as Air Force planners had been calling for all along, but rather because the positive and negative political objectives of December 1972 were so less ambitious and less constraining from those of pre-1968.  Nixon's primary positive objective was to secure the continued withdrawal of US combat troops while not abandoning South Vietnam to an imminent communist take-over.  D&eacute;tente and Kissinger's diplomacy ensured that China and the Soviet Union would not intervene, and Nixon's landslide re-election the month before removed major domestic issues from the equation.  Moreover, the conventional nature of the March '72 Easter Offensive exposed the North to punishing air attacks on their major combat units that seriously endangered their ability to defend themselves.  Thus, the pain Linebacker II inflicted led Hanoi to agree to terms that gave the US &#34;peace with honor&#34; but left them able to fight another day.  President Johnson's more sweeping positive objective (i.e. &#34;a stable, independent, non-communist South Vietnam&#34;), along with his many negative objectives (a legitimate concern of superpower escalation, a desire to protect his domestic Great Society Program and win support for the US abroad), and fundamental disagreement among his advisors on the chief objective on the air campaign, all combined to undermine Rolling Thunder's utility as a political tool.<br /><br />Is Clodfelter's work - and particularly his framework - relevant to the international security questions of today?  Absolutely.  And not just from the perspective on air power.  What are the United States' positive political objectives in the War on Terror?  What are the concomitant negative objectives that will constrain how that war is waged?  A critical inquiry of these questions will reveal that US political objectives and constraints are far more ambitious than those of the Johnson Administration, let alone Nixon.  The ability of force to achieve those objectives by themselves is, for all intents and purposes, impossible.<br /><br />Clodfelter is a political scientist and this book is pure political science, so for those interested in war stories and the like, this book most definitely isn't for you.  However, if you are looking for a cogently argued and thoroughly researched assessment of the use of force for political purposes, this book is not to bemissed.	2003-11-26

My first reaction was one of surprise that a relatively dense tome on the seemingly arcane topic of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire was able to achieve New York Times Bestseller status.  After reading it, however, I'm not at all surprised that author David Fromkin achieved critical and commercial success with this book.<br /><br />Fromkin's work has a number of things going for it: a fascinating and incredibly relevant subject; a glittering cast; a liberal dose of historical irony; and a highly effective format and literary style.<br /><br />Although the narrative is set nearly a century ago and the focus is squarely on British foreign policy, the history is germane to current events.  This book makes it clear that American foreign policy today is grappling with the mess made by London in 1914-1922.  It is impossible to fully understand and appreciate the ongoing events in Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan without a full understanding of the events so lucidly delivered in \\"A Peace to End All Peace.\\"<br /><br />The most engrossing works of popular history, I've found, accentuate the roles and inter-relations of fabulous personalities.  Academic historians may cringe at this grandstanding, but the effect in undeniable.  Fromkin has embraced this model and has benefited greatly from the fact that one the central characters in his story - Winston Churchill - is also one of the most colorful political figures of all time.  The author has a pretty strong supporting cast to work with as well, including David Lloyd George, Pasha Enver, Lord Kitchener, Mustapha Kemel (later Ataturk), and T.E. Lawrence, to name just a very few.<br /><br />Irony is a powerful and persuasive tool in story telling, and it is a centerpiece of Fromkin's narrative.  The author suggests that nearly everything about the confluence of events that brought about the political settlements of 1922 that gave us the modern Middle East is filled with tragedy and irony.  The greatest irony of all, Fromkin argues, is that in the settlements of 1922 the British got exactly what they wanted in 1914, but it was an arrangement that nobody wanted or supported in 1922.<br /><br />Finally, Fromkin is able to make such a sweeping story accessible and engaging because of his neat organization that breaks the story up into easily digestible chunks.  The book is 567 pages long (not including notes, bibliography, etc.) split up into 61 chapters, further sub-divided into three or four sections.  Thus, each idea or event is covered in two or three succinctly written pages.<br />In short, \\"A Peace to End All Peace\\" is the best book I've read in quite some time - and I read a lot.

US	49916018	R1XU5Y39LSKZ65	0020038712	438055825	WOODROW WILSON	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Excellent -- with some shortcomings	August Heckscher's one-volume biography of Woodrow Wilson is a lucidly written and admirable account of our 28th president, but marred by troubling omissions and inconsistencies.<br />Heckscher persuasively argues that the first southerner elected to the presidency since Reconstruction wasn't really southern at all.  In fact, with the exception of Andrew Jackson, no other American president had family roots so newly established in this country (his mother and all four grandparents were born in England).  Although he was reared in the South -- born in Virginia, and spending his childhood as a Presbyterian preacher's son in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina -- his family was not a member of the Old South aristocracy, but rather missionaries of the church in what Heckscher implies was more or less a foreign land.  He was, in short, no more a southerner in the White House than an American missionary returning from Africa is a Cameroonian.<br />Also, we learn little of Wilson's political consciousness as he progressed in his academic career at Bryn Mawr, Wesleyan, and finally Princeton.  Why was he a Democrat? Because nearly all white men hailing from the South in post-bellum America were Democrats?  Heckscher doesn't bother to explain.  We hear nothing of Wilson's opinions of presidents Cleveland or McKinley, or other leading party statesmen of the day.  Why did the Democratic Party's conservative wing consider Wilson to be &quot;their candidate&quot; in the 1910 New Jersey gubernatorial race?  Because he was an inveterate foe of William Jennings Bryan, the Party's progressive standard-bearer?  But he was also highly thought of at the time by Teddy Roosevelt, a &quot;progressive's progressive.\\"&quot;  Heckscher tries to shed a little more light on this question, but it is still far from clear how or why a liberal academic with Wilson's publications could have been pegged as a conservative Democrat.<br />Most surprisingly (and disappointingly), the implications of Wilson's devout Christianity and his now infamous racism are almost totally shunted aside.  Heckscher notes that Wilson had something of an epiphany while a teenager and that henceforth his relationship to God was central to his character and subsequent behavior, but that relationship plays no major role throughout the rest of the narrative of his life.  Based on other readings of Wilson's life, it seems to me that one can't fully understand Wilson without understanding his faith and how that faith shaped his worldview and his actions -- particularly in his fight for the League of Nations -- and Heckscher's work does almost nothing in that regard.<br />There is an ongoing debate about how much an historical figure should be held to modern standards of racial or religious tolerance and acceptance (Truman's anti-Semitism is a good example, and, of course, there are the slaveholding presidents of the 18th and early 19th centuries).  Wilson has been one president excoriated for his racist views, which seem all the more grotesque because they came from one of the nation's most progressive and visionary leaders, and without doubt its most educated (Wilson dropped out of UVA Law School but passed the bar in Georgia, and received his Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins).  Rather than taking this question squarely on and offering an explanation and assessment of Wilson's views on race, Heckscher just avoids it entirely.  He says that Wilson personally favored promotion of civil rights for black Americans, but the passage of the New Freedom was the sine qua non of his administration's domestic agenda and for that to succeed he needed a united Democratic Party.  The only way he could achieve unity was to abandon civil rights, which, Heckscher says, he did unhesitatingly, but with a heavy heart.  There isn't a single reference to Wilson's many racist statements in this massive tome.  If you'd read nothing more on Wilson, this biography would give you the impressionthat he was a moral crusader for black equality.<br />The Wilson that emerges from the pages of Heckscher's work is something of a pathetic figure, which is astounding because the author is so clearing sympathetic with his subject, as is often the case in presidential hagiographies.  Wilson comes across as a politician who was not-quite-ready-for-prime-time.  When confronted with political opposition -- whether as president of Princeton, governor of New Jersey, delegate to the 1919 Peace Conference, or as president trying to pass the League of Nations -- Wilson showed no art of political persuasion or ability to compromise.  Rather, his visceral reaction was to go over the heads of his opponents making demagogic appeals to the people.  His hope was always to crush his opponents under the strain of popular approval, but it almost never worked out that way.  Moreover, he was quick to attack anyone not 100% with him as being in the enemy camp, which further eroded his ability to affect an outcome in his favor.<br />In the end, after a series of strokes left him an invalid, Wilson succeeded in alientating even his most ardent loyalists, such as Joseph Tumulty and Colonel House, with his erratic and vindictive behavior.  Heckscher accuses Wilson's second wife, Edith Bolling Galt, with deliberately fostering animosity in the cabinet and making sure that Wilson would not resign for reasons of health despite the fact it left the country virtually rudderless in the stormiest of international seas.  Many figures in the Wilson administration take a few lumps in this biography, but none more than Galt, to whom the author attributes no redeeming qualities or positive contributions.<br />What is most frustrating about this book is that it is so good in so many ways that its few notable shortcomings seem almost tragic.  Neverthess, the good outweighs the bad, and it is to be recommended in spite of its warts.sion that he was a moral crusader for black equality.<br />The Wilson that emerges from the pages of Heckscher's work is something of a pathetic figure, which is astounding because the author is so clearing sympathetic with his subject, as is often the case in presidential hagiographies.

When confronted with political opposition -- whether as president of Princeton, governor of New Jersey, delegate to the 1919 Peace Conference, or as president trying to pass the League of Nations -- Wilson showed no art of political persuasion or ability to compromise.  Rather, his visceral reaction was to go over the heads of his opponents making demagogic appeals to the people.  His hope was always to crush his opponents under the strain of popular approval, but it almost never worked out that way.  Moreover, he was quick to attack anyone not 100% with him as being in the enemy camp, which further eroded his ability to affect an outcome in his favor.  <br />In the end, after a series of strokes left him an invalid, Wilson succeeded in alientating even his most ardent loyalists, such as Joseph Tumulty and Colonel House, with his erratic and vindictive behavior.  Heckscher accuses Wilson's second wife, Edith Bolling Galt, with deliberately fostering animosity in the cabinet and making sure that Wilson would not resign for reasons of health despite the fact it left the country virtually rudderless in the stormiest of international seas.  Many figures in the Wilson administration take a few lumps in this biography, but none more than Galt, to whom the author attributes no redeeming qualities or positive contributions.<br />What is most frustrating about this book is that it is so good in so many ways that its few notable shortcomings seem almost tragic.  Neverthess, the good outweighs the bad, and it is to be recommended in spite of its warts.	2003-09-11
US	49916018	R2Z9788SG2HEQS	0670802255	967052390	Haig's Command: Earl Haig and the Background to the First World War	Books	2	11	16	N	N	A polemic, not history	Part military history, part rant, part character assassination, and part conspiracy theory, Denis Winter's \\"Haig's Command\\" has, in a morbid sense, something for everyone.<br />The central thesis of the book is simple, yet sensational: The \\"truth\\" about British military operations in France during the First World War was concealed for nearly fifty years because Field Marshal Douglas Haig, with the complicity of the British government, bowdlerized and rewrote the official records so that his own incompetence (and indirectly that of the British Government) would be hidden. Winter claims that the true story can be pieced together by comparing the histories and minutes of the Dominion records (i.e. Australian and Canadian) that escaped the censorious scalpel and became public record in the 1960s.<br />From beginning to end, Winter unleashes a firestorm of abuse on Haig. To begin with, he says, Haig's military career is the story of a completely fabricated C.V. and the patronage of a few, well-placed figures in the British Army. Moreover, the author hints that Haig's relationship with these key mentors -- most notably Lords Kitchener and Esher -- may have been homosexual in nature.  As a Corps commander under Sir John French during the opening months of the war, Haig bungled every operation he was entrusted with, Winter says, so his eventual promotion to Field Marshal had nothing to do with battlefield performance.<br />From the moment Haig takes command in December 1915, Winter's book so entirely rewrites the history of the Western Front that it is impossible to synthesize his points and accusations. Needless to say, everything you've read before is wrong; everything Haig did was a moronic disaster; and everything in the British war records is a willful, malicious lie.<br />This book comes with the imprimatur of dusk jacket praise from Norman Stone, a respected historian of the First World War. It also lists some prominent endorsements for Winter's previous effort, the widely acclaimed \\"Death's Men.\\" It isn't surprising that John Keegan and others refused to sign up in support of the author's latest work.<br />If you are a serious student of military history and the First World War in particular, it may not be a bad idea to familiarize yourself with Winter's arguments, if only to reject them out of hand. Otherwise, don't bother with this book.widely acclaimed \\"Death's Men.\\" It isn't surprising that John Keegan and others refused to sign up in support of the author's latest work.<br />If you are a serious student of military history and the First World War in particular, it may not be a bad idea to familiarize yourself with Winter's arguments, if only to reject them out of hand.

In fact, I very nearly avoided it altogether based on the overwhelmingly negative reviews by some of the leading scholars of strategic studies. In a fascinating exchange on Slate.com in June 1999, Eliot Cohen (my academic advisor, mentor and good friend) and Paul Fussell competed with one another over which one disliked Ferguson's history more, describing his work alternatively as &#34;smarty,&#34; &#34;pedantic,&#34; &#34;inane,&#34; and &#34;irritating.&#34;<br /><br />In the Summer 2001 issue of National Interest, Michael Howard, the doyen of war studies, was decidedly cool to the conclusions in The Pity of War, although not hostile to Ferguson' alternative approach, which he called &#34;a refreshing variant on an otherwise sterile debate.&#34; In a separate 2001 interview Michael Howard claimed that the biggest breakthrough in the field of military history in his lifetime had been the &#34;study of 'total history'; history studied in real depth and width.&#34;<br /><br />It seems to me this is precisely what Ferguson's work provides and why it should be recommended. This is a book on war filled with charts and graphs showing the movement of bond prices, not battle maps showing the movement of divisions. If this book were written by a lesser talent, it would have been an embarrassing failure. But Ferguson writes extremely well and (perhaps more importantly given the recondite subject matter) his chapters are neatly laid out and his main points are clearly elucidated. Clearly elucidated -- and outlandish.<br /><br />The book reads as if it were ghost-written by Alfred von Wegerer, the head of Germany's Center for the Study of the Causes of the War, a quasi-think tank offshoot of the War Guilt Section of the German Foreign Ministry in the 1920s and 30s whose sole mission was to spin the history of World War I in Germany's favor. First, he blames his native Britain for just about everything: diplomatic blundering that led to the start of the war; entry into the war that made it a global conflict; and a contribution to the war that made it stretch on for four long, miserable years. Second, he claims that a German victory would have just led to a benign, EU-like arrangment on the continent. Again, I say: It is the heterodox approach and perspective of this book that makes it well worth reading, not its iconoclastic message.<br /><br />In closing, if you are looking for one book to read on the First World War, this is not the one to get. If, however, you are familiar with the subject and are looking for a book that will challenge your assumptions and perhaps make you rethink your understanding the seminal conflict of the twentieth century, The Pity of the War may be well-worth your time.the war that made it a global conflict; and a contribution to the war that made it stretch on for four long, miserable years.

Tangles of barbed wire, machine gun nests, pockmarked no-man's-land, gas masks, stacks of mutilated cadavers, and mountains of expended artillery shells.  The names Ypres, Flanders, Somme and Verdun are synonymous with horrifying and senseless slaughter of attrition.  However, the western front and its &#34;marquee&#34; battles are just part of the story of the Great War.<br /><br />Norman Stone's &#34;The Eastern Front, 1914-1917&#34; shines the light of history on the &#34;other front,&#34; a theater of battle that is still somewhat shrouded in mystery over 80 years after the last gun fell silent.  What is perhaps most striking about the eastern front is how dissimilar it was from the engagements in the west.  Although it consumed as many lives as the conflagration in the west, the primary military failure in the east wasn't the failure to recognize and leverage the strength of a defensive posture, but rather a failure to effectively exploit the offensive.  Whilst the French, British and Germans settled into a defensive war of attrition, the Germans, Austrians and Russians continued in a war of maneuver.  The eastern front was twice as long as that in the west with about half the artillery and poor railway networks to efficiently shift reserves to threatened areas.  The great battles of the east (today familiar only to those with a keen interest in military history) such as Tannenberg, Lodz, Riga, Gorlice-Tarnow, and the Brusilov offensive, were largely offensive victories.  The attrition in the east was caused by inadequate transportation and exhausted troops trying to fully exploit the offensive opportunities, not the attrition of withering firepower experienced in the west.<br /><br />It should be noted that the title (and cover) of this book is a bit misleading.  This is a history of Tsarist Russia at war; it is not a history of the entire eastern theater.  Major operations such as the central powers drive to crush Serbia in 1915, the multiple battles around Isonzo on the Italian/Austrian front, and the Entente's beach head at Salonika (to name just a few) are touched upon only tangentially.  The narrative is delivered almost entirely from the Russian perspective.<br /><br />Stone's central argument is that Russia was much better equipped to fight the First World War than it is traditionally given credit for.  Its decisive weaknesses were not an inability to produce artillery shells in large numbers, the ineffectiveness of its peasant soldiers, or the economic backwardness of the nation as a whole.  Rather, these explanations are simply &#34;hard luck&#34; stories created by the Russian military officers themselves to hide the real source of failure: incompetence and poor organization.  The Tsarist army, Stone says, was crippled by a political schism in its officer corps.  There were two mutually exclusive camps in the Russian Army: those officers (mostly of middle class origin) who sided with the reform-minded War Minister Sukhomlinov, and all those who opposed him (mostly the old aristocracy and cavalry elites).  Stone notes that many Sukhomlinovite commanding generals would have anti-Sukhomnilov chiefs of staff with whom they were not on speaking terms.  Or, in the case of Tannenberg, one general would be a Sukhomlinovite (Samsonov) and the other a bitter Sukhomlinov opponent (Rennenkampf).  Under such conditions, Stone concludes, it was easier to blame Russian failures on material shortages and poor frontline soldier morale than their own incompetence and the acute political and organizational crisis gripping the army.<br /><br />In closing, Stone's work offers a unique and authoritative perspective on a largely forgotten aspect of what has been called the defining experience of the 20th century.

The nature and origins of the conflict are cogently presented.  He describes the main actors in the tale -- Alfred Milner, Cecil Rhodes, Paul Kruger, Jan Smuts, etc. -- with a dramatic flair that greatly adds to the readability of the book and turns the history of the conflict into a clash of personalities as much as a clash of empire.  The author also does a superb job putting the events of the Boer War in the context of the Victorian Age and the last days of Splendid Isolation of the British Empire.  Finally, the book has a number of detailed, but easy to follow maps that greatly enhance the readers ability to follow and digest the narrative (those who frequently read military history understand that this isn't a trivial point).<br /><br />Ironically, however, the thing that struck me the most about this book was something the author never commented on at all: the remarkable historical parallels between the Boer War and the US war in Vietnam sixty-five years later.  In light of salient differences in the conflicts (time, place, technology, people, the outcome -- the British \\"won\\" -- etc.), the wars followed a similar trajectory and the British and American forces developed similar responses to similar challenges.<br /><br />To begin with, the British and American forces suffered from a significant handicap in intelligence collection and mobility, a disadvantage neither side was ever able to overcome.  Second, both the British and Americans deployed massive amounts of troops to the theater, but only a small fraction were ever able to engage the enemy, creating an extremely long and cumbersome \\"tail\\" with precious few 'teeth.'  Third, the inability to effectively hold territory or engage the enemy in open battle deprived the British and Americans of traditional battlefield metrics, and ultimately led to the use of enemy \\"body count\\" (Kitchener called it \\"the bag\\" but it was the same idea in principle) as the ineffective but de facto measurement of success.  Fourth, the challenge of keeping the civilian population separated from the marauding guerillas led the British and Americans to the same response, including locking local populations up in protected communities (called \\"laagers\\" in South Africa and \\"hamlets\\" in Vietnam) and the creation of a protective fence to prevent the enemy from penetrating territory ostensibly held by local forces.  Fifth, attempts to fight the enemy on even terms led both the British and Americans to develop their own version of guerillas to fight along side friendly locals (the carbineers in South Africa -- including  the famous Breaker Morant and the Marine Corps \\"Ruff-Puffs\\" in Vietnam).  Finally, the British and American war efforts were gravely undermined by massive public unrest against the war on the home front.<br /><br />For those with a keen interest in military history in general or colonial/anti-insurgency campaigns in particular, this book is not to be missed.ineffective but de facto measurement of success.

Their lives are filled with a mix of remarkable achievement and profound disappointment; monumental success and disgrace both seem inevitable.  The late twentieth century had Bill Clinton, and the early nineteenth had Daniel Webster.<br /><br />Webster's story - like Clinton's - is at once inspiring and frustrating, laudable and detestable.  There is certainly an element of \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" in Daniel Webster, and the noted Jacksonian historian Robert Remini uses that split personality as the foundation in building this important biography of one of America's greatest and most unique statesman.<br /><br />Webster's genius is undeniable.  His many natural gifts, which even his bitterest enemies had to concede, earned him the highly flattering sobriquet \\"the Godlike Daniel.\\"  No private attorney has affected the course of American judicial history as much as Webster.  With the ideologically sympathetic John Marshall presiding over the Supreme Court, he successfully argued nearly every landmark case of the early nineteenth century: Dartmouth College, Gibbons vs. Ogden , McCollough vs. Maryland.  He also added his considerable talents to the defense of the Union, first during the South Carolina nullification crisis in the celebrated Hayne-Webster debates, and then in the twilight of his life as the debate over slavery mounted toward civil war he delivered an impassioned speech in defense of the Compromise of 1850.  His many public addresses lauding the ideals and principles of the American republic - the Plymouth Oration, Bunker Hill Oration, commemoration of the lives of Jefferson and Adams - are legendary and were once memorized by schoolboys.  When a Webster speech was anticipated in the Senate, the halls were jammed with attendees eager to hear history in the making.  Indeed, as Stephen Benet notes in the classic The Devil and Daniel Webster: \\"You see, for a while, he [Webster] was the biggest man in the country.  He never got to be President, but he was the biggest man.\\"<br /><br />But there was also a less admirable, more human side to Daniel Webster; an alter ego to the Godlike Daniel known derisively as \\"Black Dan.\\"  Addictions to alcohol and gambling were the duel crosses Webster had to bear through out life.  These afflictions ensured Webster was chronically in debt despite a flourishing law practice.  These debts eventually presented conflicts of interests and put him in compromising positions, which undermined his moral authority and ultimately cost him the White House.<br /><br />It has been written that most great men are made by the events of their times, but a very select few would have been great regardless of time or place.  Remini's splendid biography suggests that Daniel Webster is a strong candidate for the latter category.ssic The Devil and Daniel Webster: \\"You see, for a while, he [Webster] was the biggest man in the country.

The plot is filled with so much drama, so many eccentric and historically significant characters, bizarre twists of fate and intrigue that by the time you reach the denouement of Dreyfus' acquittal it is nearly impossible to believe that what you are reading actually happened.<br /><br />Second, even with a century's worth of perspective, there are still many debatable points about the Affair. For instance, it has been often repeated that had Dreyfus not been Dreyfus, he would have been Anti-Dreyfus. Bredin explicitly rejects this thesis, but after reading his book I must respectfully disagree. There is much about the Dreyfus Affair that is alternatively poignant, ironic, and tragic. That Dreyfus was personally imbued with and adhered to the principles and cause of his chief adversaries - namely a devotion to hierarchy and order, an unflinching loyalty to the Army and his superiors, and fervent nationalism - is one of them. Ultimately, whether the traitor was guilty or not was beside the point. During the course of the Affair, the Old Regime and its honored institutions, the Army and the Catholic Church above all, were pitted against the agents of Revolution. The Dreyfus that Bredin describes would never have deserted the cause of the Army and national honor to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the radical leftist elements that made up the Dreyfusard community.<br /><br />Finally, the Affair also serves as a cautionary tale for modern readers. The themes that dominated late nineteenth century France - the imminent threat of war with a long-time rival, agitated nationalism in the wake of a national tragedy, reactionary xenophobia and racial profiling - are not foreign to early twenty-first century Americans. It is important to remember that the Dreyfus Affair began quite accidentally; it was the mood of the nation that served as the tinderbox that lit the conflagration. There was circumstantial evidence pointing to Dreyfus as the author of a letter written to the German military attach&eacute; in Paris. That evidence was further supported by prejudice that expected an Alsatian Jew to be a traitor. When the French General Staff embarked on their mission to fabricate evidence against Dreyfus, it was with the complete conviction that they had the guilty party and merely wanted to ensure that he was appropriately punished. That first legal transgression, which seemed rather innocuous at the time, was the root of the conflict, for in order to save itself from that first indiscretion greater illegalities had to be committed. It is not impossible to envision something like this happening domestically in the United States in the course of the War on Terror. Let us pray it never does.<br /><br />Few books have as much to offer as \\"The Affair.\\" It is a truly superlative work.nalism in the wake of a national tragedy, reactionary xenophobia and racial profiling - are not foreign to early twenty-first century Americans.

Zola's &quot;La Debacle,&quot; set during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, is every bit as good as these classics.  Yet, somehow, this piece seems to have been dropped from the list of war novel classics.<br />Zola spent 20 years researching the conflict in great detail and his novel is as faithful to historical fact as any ever written.  Few military defeats have been as sudden, unanticipated, complete and humiliating as the French collapse in 1870.  Zola captures the demoralizing effect that the vertiginous orders and counter-orders had on the French troops in the early phases of the war.  A complete lack of planning and mobilization plans, along with inefficient communications and intelligence services, led to scattered units marching aimlessly in search of the enemy without food or shelter and without any general plan of operations.  The French were truly defeated before ever making contact with the Prussians.  La Debacle is as a good an illustration of the &quot;fog of war&quot; as any I've read.	2003-02-17

His ambitious attempt to tell the story of the famed banking dynasty of J.P Morgan could not have succeeded more brilliantly.  Here is a story not of just a bank.  It is even more than simply the story of the financial services industry.  It is, in fact, the story of the modern era, where everyone from Teddy Roosevelt and Benito Mussolini to Paul Volker and Ivan Boesky figure prominently.<br />At the heart of this epic is a great paradox: the rise of modern global finance ushered in the demise of the banker.  In J.P. Morgan's day, a small group of bankers held sway over giant corporations and the governments of global powers, serving as intimate advisors and self-regulating their industry with a strict but unwritten gentleman banker's code of conduct.  The institutions that banks like Morgan created ultimately grew too powerful to control.  Whereas once governments and companies were at the mercy of their bankers, today the reverse is true.  Chernow tells the story of this transformation in exquisite detail and with admirable clarity.<br />As interesting and well written as this book is, some may still find it to be a challenge to finish.  For those who like to read a few pages before bed every night, you should expect the \\"House of Morgan\\" to be on the nightstand for several months.  However, if you have the time and commitment, you'll likely find the experience of reading this book to be a worthwhile and fulfilling one.	2003-02-12

As an avid reader of history, I've long struggled with putting my learning to use in day-to-day situations, whether that be in evaluating critical business decisions or in helping me better observe and understand the world around me.  On the one hand, there is the familiar aphorism attributed to George Santayana that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.  But, on the other hand, each situation is truly unique, and the use of historical analogies is clearly fraught with pitfalls.  &#34;Thinking in Time&#34; addresses this conundrum and provides a sound basis for using historical knowledge intelligently and responsibly.<br /><br />To overcome the temptation of using history incorrectly, the authors put forward a specific process for decision makers in crisis situations, and they use case studies to highlight successes and failures in the use of history as guide to decision making.  The case studies are all drawn from domestic and foreign policy scenarios, but the lessons are applicable to any organization (private sector, non-profit, etc.).<br /><br />The authors' decision making methodology may seem a bit didactic or formulaic at first, but it is meant to be used with the greatest flexibility.  The heart of the process is to establish a system of critical inquiry and resist the temptation to jump to the &#34;options phase&#34; of decision making immediately.  Rather, the authors argue, focus clearly on the situation at hand and confirm the intended objective.  This can be started by listing what is known, what is unclear and what is presumed about the situation.  Next, analogies will come to mind or will likely be invoked for advocacy (intentionally or otherwise), so quickly highlight all the &#34;likenesses&#34; and &#34;differences&#34; between the present situation and the historical analogies.  This should further clarify the present situation and the intended objectives.<br /><br />The authors suggest other tools that, while useful, are a bit more cumbersome than separating the known from the unclear from the presumed in any given situation, which I know do religiously at work.  Some of the other techniques covered include laying out a timeline of the event, including major concurrent events along with the details; asking journalistic questions (where, how, why, what, etc.) for each major event along the timeline; setting odds for given &#34;if - then&#34; scenarios; explicitly laying out what kind of information (new &#34;knowns&#34;) would change your various &#34;presumeds&#34;; and for various options asking &#34;For the objective of X, Y is the best option because....&#34;<br /><br />In closing, &#34;Thinking in Time&#34; is one of the ten most influential books I've ever read.  If you are in a leadership position in business, government or even the local lodge, this book can make you a more effective leader.

Disgraced French commanders such as Bazaine or Bourbaki are more pitied by Howard than criticized for their performance.  He argues that primary fault for the disasters that befell the French armies were more the product of a defective French military system that put such incompetent men in command of large armies, rather than the fault of the incompetent commanders themselves.<br />Only occasionally does Howard divert his attention to the Prussian side, and when he does it is most often to discuss the friction generated between Moltke and Bismark or to describe the usually quick and effective Prussian reaction to halting or diffident French moves.  However, Howard seems to place no stock in the notion of a German genius for war.  For instance, he is quick to point out the many mistakes Moltke's army made, particularly in the early days of the conflict, and notes that more often than not the French troops gave just as good as they got in open battles with the Germans.<br />In many ways, the Franco-Prussian War marked the culmination of the dramatic military reforms begun by Scharnhorst after the disastrous defeat at the hands of Napoleon at the Battle of Jena in 1806.  Prussian improvements in military recruitment, training and organization, and most notably the development of a General Staff responsible for managing the immense requirements of modern war were all brought to bear on the French and in many accounts is credited with the stunning victory.  Howard recognizes the revolutionary implications of the railroad, telegraph and rifled weaponry, and also notes the decisive influence Prussian military planning and organization had in the conflict.  Indeed, he notes that the war was a watershed event in military history.  On the one hand, the conflict included perhaps the last successful cavalry charge in history, as well as the final employment of Vauban's time-honored siegecraft techniques developed in the 17th century.  Yet, the war also held some harbingers of future warfare, such as the deliberate bombardment of civilian populations at Strasburg and Paris in an attempt to undermine civilian morale and storm troop tactics developed to minimize casualties in attacking positions defended by troops with rapid firing rifled weaponry.  Nevertheless, in the final analysis, Howard seems to credit the French more with defeat than the Prussians with victory.<br />Finally, it should be noted there are a lack of adequate campaigns maps, which makes many portions of the book difficult to follow.opment of a General Staff responsible for managing the immense requirements of modern war were all brought to bear on the French and in many accounts is credited with the stunning victory.

Much to his surprise, he learned that even after several years of total war, homeland bombardment and facing numerically superior enemies, the Germans still retained a 30% edge in combat effectiveness.  That is, on the battlefields of Europe in 1944, 100 German troops were the equivalent 130 US or British troops.  He wanted to know how and why these \\"defeated\\" German armies could fight so well?<br />The answer to the riddle of superior German combat effectiveness, Depuy says, has nothing to do with genetic or cultural traits of aggressiveness or obedience to authority, as others have suggested.  Rather, he argues that the superiority was a deliberate product of the German General Staff, which was incredibly successful in its mission of institutionalizing military excellence through extremely competitive officer selection processes, advanced training, an emphasis on military history and individual initiative in combat, and a commitment to objectivity in planning and analysis.  Indeed, Depuy says the General Staff was able to institutionalize military genius, usually found only in rare individuals such as Hannibal, Gustavus Adolphus, Napoleon and others in the pantheon of military greats.  As abhorrent as Nazi policies may have been - and as culpable as the officer corps may have been in the atrocities of the Nazi regime by either direct collaboration or failure to intervene - Depuy argues that nothing can take away from the fact that the German army consistently out-planned, out-manuevered, and out-fought the Allies.  Moreover, they often accomplished these feats against incredible odds, including significantly smaller forces, lack of air superiority, and the complete compromise of their operational plans through successful Allied code-breaking efforts.<br />It should be noted that while Depuy's work is highly readable and sound on facts, it is far from original.  His citations - which are few and far between - come almost exclusively from secondary sources.  Depuy doesn't make any significant contribution to our understanding of the General Staff, its genesis, development and accomplishments beyond what Ritter (\\"The Sword and Scepter\\"), Craig (\\"The Politics of the Prussian Army\\"), Goerlitz (\\"A History of the German General Staff\\") and others have already made.  These three sources, in particular, clearly were the foundation of Depuy's work, although he does, at times, take issue with some of their conclusions.<br />Its lack of originality doesn't mean the book is without value or virtue.  Indeed, for those looking for a concise review of the history of the German General Staff with a distinct focus on how it influenced combat effectiveness, and not wishing to delve into a book long on details and thoroughly academic in nature, Depuy's \\"A Genius for War\\" may be the right book for you.  If, however, you are interested in a more complete study of the General Staff, including the critical issues of civil-military relations and one that puts German military developments in the context of the European state system of the times, this reviewer would strongly suggest that you stick with Craig, Ritter and Goerlitz.e noted that while Depuy's work is highly readable and sound on facts, it is far from original.

The primary focus of the book is on the civil-military relations of the Prussian state beginning with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 and tracings its evolution and influence to the Second World War when Hitler and the Nazis crushed the political influence of the officer corps.  In addition, the book also addresses a number other issues in exquisite detail, including the formation of the German General Staff, the strategy developed before the First and Second World Wars, and the social conflict of the unified German states.<br />Craig's conclusions on the Prussian officer corps, their reforms and their performance are rather \\"standard\\" as far as historical interpretations go - but that is due in no small part to the fact that the author in many ways set the standard.  The most salient theme of the book is that for all the German military got right in planning, strategy and innovation, it was never able to effectively solve the civil-military relationship issue, and it was that failure that led to the disasters of the First and Second World Wars.<br />In Craig's opinion, the opportunity for success was formulated but squandered early in 19th century.  After the devastating defeat at Jena in 1807 at the hands of Napoleon, the once vaunted Prussian military had to assess how and why the disaster had occurred.  The solution presented by the great military reformer Scharnhorst was the institutionalization of military genius in a centralized, elite general staff and the accountability of the armed services to the German people through an oath of allegiance to a republican constitution, rather than personal fealty to the monarch.  The former was adopted and proved a stunning success, especially in the wars against the Danes, Austrians and French in 1866-1872.  However, the conservative officer corps' unwillingness to embrace the more liberal reform set forth by Scharnhorst kept the military at odds with the nation it served and ultimately led to the military's political dominance in World War I and political subjugation in World War II.<br />If you have a keen interest in civil-military relations, German history, or the development of the General Staff system this book is simply indispensable.beral reform set forth by Scharnhorst kept the military at odds with the nation it served and ultimately led to the military's political dominance in World War I and political subjugation in World War II.<br />If you have a keen interest in civil-military relations, German history, or the development of the General Staff system this book is simply indispensable.	2003-01-02

I, for one, am the latter.<br />The essence of Irwin Unger's \\"The Greenback Era\\" - the 1965 winner of the Pulitzer Prize in history - is that the motivations of the hard and soft money supporters of the post Civil War period are more nuanced than Charles Beard and other leading American historians would have you believe.  The author rejects what he calls the duality and economic determinism of the old school.  That is, that economic self-interest was the sole motivator in determining how one felt about the federal issue of paper legal tender (the Greenbacks) and that those motivations ultimately split the nation into mutually exclusive groups: East vs. West, debtor vs. creditor, agrarian vs. industrialist.  Unger demonstrates that many groups held positions counter to what their economic self-interest would suggest, such as Western farmers whose deep-seated hostility to \\"rag money\\" dated back to the Jacksonian Era and held firm even as they suffered the brunt of the credit squeeze during the depression of the 1870s.<br />The book is well written and quite informative, although a bit anti-climatic (if such a term is appropriate to describe a treatise on post bellum national finance).  The book traces the ideological battle between the forces in favor of hard money (resumption to gold) and those in favor of maintaining the Greenbacks from the period immediately following the Civil War to the resumption of the gold standard on 1 January 1879.  Unger would have been well-advised to include a concluding chapter that put the debate and its denouement into historical and economic perspective, especially as it related to the Silver question, which in many ways was the robust progeny of the Greenback debate.  As it is, \\"The Greenback Era\\" just seems to end with the resumption of gold payments with nary a thought or reflection on what it all meant.e.

Lewis is -- much to my surprise, I must admit -- an extremely talented writer with a gift for metaphor and the art of character description and analysis.<br />One of the endearing things about this book, I think, is that it is laced with a certain self-deprecating tone.  Lewis' basic thesis (although I don't think he really believes it) is that the the most glaring sign of Salomon's impending demise was that it started hiring people such as himself.  Despite many self-effacing comments, however, Lewis points out repeatedly that he was the highest paid -- and thus best producing -- young bond salesman at Salomon during his tenure and seeks to assure the reader that he isn't some scorned ex-employee who couldn't hack the perils of life on the trading floor.<br />Lewis dedicates a few chapters to explaining the rise of the mortgage trading desk at Salomon and the junk bond market under Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham, although neither have much to do with Lewis' career as a government bond salesman in Salomon's London Office.  Did the author think this gave proper perspective and background to the telling of his personal story or was it an effort to pad out an already short piece of work?  Probably a bit of both, is my guess.<br />In sum, if you approach this book (as I did) as a roman a clef, with all the exaggerations and artistic license associated with fiction, rather than a legitimate memoir, you'll probably get a lot more enjoyment out of it.  It is funny, fast-paced, often incredible -- and will quickly expunge any thoughts you once had of being an investment banker, no matter how high the salaries might be.	2002-11-16

If (like me) you majored in economics, you'll be surprised how much better Greider is in explaining arcane economic theory than your college professors (and you'll probably learn -- or re-learn -- quite a bit in the process).<br />The focal point of the book is the celebrated and controversial tenure of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker (1979-1987), but the mechanics of central banking so clearly and concisely explained are just as much applicable today as in 1980 - or 1950 for that matter.<br /> Greider divides the book into three more-or-less equal thirds.  The first covers the inflationary surge of the 1970s, Carter's tenuous decision to appoint Volker, and Volker's radical move of abandoning the control of interest rates in favor of controlling the nation's money supply.  (In other words, a shift from the Keynesian orthodoxy dominant in the post-War period in favor of a monetarist approach more in line with the theories of the iconoclastic economist Milton Friedman.)  The second, and most informative third provides an historical overview of central banking and its development in the United States.  For those solely interested in a better understanding of central banking and the US Federal Reserve in particular, this book will be worth your while even if you only read this middle section.  The final third deals with Volker's punishing monetary policy during the early 1980s, as he attempted to destroy lingering anticipation of inflation and the incredibly simulative effects of the Reagan era federal deficits and tax cuts.<br />Greider is highly critical of Volker's performance as Fed chairman.  In short, he argues that far from being the independent and benevolent Shepard of the economy it often claims to be, the Fed, in practice, is beholden to its most powerful constituency: the major money-center financial institutions (i.e. Citibank, Bank of America, etc.).  Traditional central bankers view combating inflation as their primary professional objective, which tends to favor creditors at the expense of debtors.  Grieder suggests that in waging war on inflation the Fed in effect was waging war on the millions of ordinary Americans struggling to make end meets and keep their heads above water.<br />Whether you agree with his conclusions or not, Greider's \\"Secrets of the Temple\\" is exhaustively researched, expertly written, and extremely enlightening.al of Volker's performance as Fed chairman.

In an age when seemingly every historical topic has been debated from six different angles I was surprised to find very little still in print on the subject, let alone a modern account by an accomplished historian.  Brands and his publishers have chosen their subject and their audience (i.e. mainstream) well.<br />In the end, I enjoyed this book immensely, but it was not the book I would have expected Brands to write.  It is expertly written and a joy to read; nevertheless, it lacks the intellectual gravity of David McCullough's piece on the Panama Canal or Richard Rhodes' telling of the building of the atomic bomb, for instance, which I would have preferred.	2002-10-09

In his book, however, Remini seeks to address just one side of the controversy: the political. He concedes that there was much good in the BUS from a strictly economic perspective and destroying it without a concrete plan to replace the monetary institution undoubtedly did harm to the American economy as a whole. But, Remini argues, it was the political implications of the War - not the Panic of 1837 or the subsequent failure to adopt central banking in the US for nearly a century - that had the more far-reaching consequences.<br /><br />It has been argued that Jackson was the first modern president. It is undeniable that the power of the presidency took a giant leap forward during Jackson's two-terms and Remini shows that those monumental gains in power came mostly during and because of the Bank War.<br /><br />In particular, Remini argues that the Bank War is directly responsible for three areas of enhanced presidential power: 1) the use of the veto to reject legislation for purely political rather than constitutional reasons, thus inserting the president into the legislative process and, in effect, making his opinion count for two-thirds of both Houses of Congress; 2) even though Remini believes that the majority of Americans didn't support the president's stance on the BUS, Jackson made the election of 1832 a referendum on the bank issue and claimed henceforth that he represented the will of the people and was there one representative; and 3) Jackson's sacking of Secretary of the Treasury Duane for his refusal to remove the government deposits from the BUS exerted the president's right to remove Cabinet members at will, further strengthening the executive's grip over the government.<br /><br />In short, there is stunning agreement between Remini and Hammond on a number of issues. For instance, Remini concedes that Jackson's veto of the BUS re-charter in July 1832 was pure demagogic class baiting with indefensible charges against the BUS's operations. He also rejects the notion that Jackson's re-election was a popular show of support for his attack on the BUS and he credits Nicolas Biddle with running an efficient, although by no means perfect, central banking organization. Thus, on economic grounds, Remini really sides with Hammond. But, Remini maintains, the economics of the issue was a distant second to the politics of issue. The cause of the War was political - namely, Jackson's refusal to bend or even appear to bend to a political challenge - and the most significant results of the War were political.

One of his latest books, \\"Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power,\\" is certainly no exception.<br />The book was written, at least in part, as a response to the critically acclaimed and wildly popular \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" by Jared Diamond.  Hanson derides the geographic deterministic conclusions presented by Diamond - the idea that Western power is more or less a fluke of geography - and lays out an alternative explanation for the dominance of the Western world over other cultures.  But rather than offering an alternative anthropological perspective, Hanson uses military history to explain the West's dominance since the Hellenistic age.  From a strictly objective and amoral perspective, Hanson says, Western liberal democracies have proven incredibly efficient at killing enemies in war and thus conquering much of the globe.<br />Hanson central thesis is that there are nine \\"paradigms\\" that, when combined, account for the superiority of Western warfare and the extreme bloodshed when Western nations fight one another: 1) political freedom as the cornerstone of Western culture from which all else flows; 2) the quest for decisive battles of annihilation rather than ritualistic battle often found in non-Western cultures; 3) the concept of military service as a civic duty, which provides the West with large numbers of highly motivated troops; 4) a focus on heavy infantry shock engagements; 5) a spirit of rationalism and the scientific method, which has paid huge dividends in the form of advanced military technology; 6) the economic model of capitalism, which has exploited technological advances to their fullest and rapidly put weapons in the hands of large Western armies; 7) the discipline to fight as a unit and thus get the most out of Western technology and mass production capability; 8) individualism and initiative in battle; and 9) dissent, self-critique and civic audit of military operations.  He uses individual East-West battles - including Western \\"defeats\\" such as Cannae, Isandhlwana (along with his discussion of Rorke's Drift) and Tet (from a strategic perspective) - throughout history to illustrate each of the paradigms.  The author is quick to note that his selection of battles has little to do with his overall conclusions and that a completely different collections of battles could be used to demonstrate the same points.<br />Each chapter is well written and vivid in its description of the various battles  (early on Hanson notes that war is all about killing men, not the more antiseptic issue of strategy).  For those whose reading has tended to focus on contemporary military history, the early chapters on Salamis, Guagamela, Cannae (Hanson is a professor of classics, so these first three are his speciality), Poitiers and Tenochtitlan will be particularly enlightening and rewarding.<br />In the end, Hanson's arguments are compelling, but far from convincing.  The notion that Western scientific inquiry and commercial enterprise have greatly facilitated military power is undeniable.  So too is his argument that military professionalism and its focus on discipline have proven decisive in lopsided engagements.  However, the idea that only citizens of a Western democracy can field large armies of motivated men capable of initiative or that seeking decisive shock battle is key to victory are much more debatable.

The fact that it still remains in print is testament to its profound influence and popularity.  Indeed, the title of the book resurrected what was then an old and rather obscure term and elevated it into the mainstream American lexicon.<br /><br />Reading the book today, the reader will discover that many of Josephson's observations - such as his favorable comments on the then contemporary economic programs of Stalinist Russia - are risible in hindsight.  But he does provide a broad overview of the major players and thoroughly chronicles the great evils attributed to them and their practices - at least from the perspective of a 1930s socialist.<br /><br />In short, this book, if it must be read at all, should be read to gain insight into the early twentieth century liberal bias against capitalism and its embrace of a socialist future, rather than a legitimate economic history of the United States in the post bellum period, which it most definitely is not.	2002-09-25

Jared Diamond has achieved great success with \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" (national best-seller, Pulitzer Prize), but it has also made him the target of strident, often venomous criticism...<br /><br />Diamond's general thesis is that the West conquered the world rather than vice versa because of a fluke of nature.  In short, Eurasia was home to an important number of crops and animals that readily lent themselves to successful domestication.  This domestication resulted in mass food production, which the author claims is the \\"ultimate\\" cause of Western dominance.  Food production, in turn, led to a number of \\"proximate\\" causes related to the rise of the West: farms and animal herds led to stationary populations and excess food to support a specialized class of bureaucrats and soldiers; it also increased population density, which, along with close contact with animals, led to germs and the subsequent genetic resistance of Westerners to those diseases.  Finally, Diamond concludes, the unique East-West axis of Eurasia and the absence of any impenetrable geographic barriers fostered the spread of new crops, technologies, etc., which gave rise to many competing communities, whose competition further increased the western lead over the rest of the world.<br /><br />Diamond's arguments are persuasive on the surface, and even the biggest skeptic will have reason for pause after reading his book.  However, the final chapter reveals that he can't really resolve a fundamental question: why did Europe, rather than the Middle East, India or China come to conquer the world?  Almost the entire book is dedicated to explaining why the Eurasian landmass was blessed with the prerequisites for large civilizations rather than the Americas, Africa and Australia.  His terse explanation for why Europe in particular dominated leaves much to be desired and explained.<br /><br />In this reviewer's opinion, the recent book by classicist Victor Davis Hanson (\\"Carnage and Culture\\") provides a plausible epilogue for Diamond's piece.  Hanson completely and explicitly rejects Diamond's geographic determinism, but I don't think the two theses are incompatible or in any way mutually exclusive.  In fact, it seems to me that Diamond and Hanson support one another, as the latter's assertion that the war-making efficiency of liberal democracies beginning in the Hellenistic period explains Europe's ultimate triumph.<br /><br />In closing, as an introduction to anthropology and a cogent depiction of one school of thought on the rise of the West this book is marvelous.  Approach it with an open-mind, reflect on the thesis and the supporting evidence, and then draw your own conclusions.  Love it or hate it, you owe it to yourself to read this book.wer's opinion, the recent book by classicist Victor Davis Hanson (\\"Carnage and Culture\\") provides a plausible epilogue for Diamond's piece.

In short, this book is most definitely NOT for everyone, and even the most committed students will find that the author makes you work for the insights the book delivers.<br /><br />Although the book covers over a century of early American banking (from the first colonial land grant offices to the Civil War), the unmistakable focus is Nicolas Biddle's management of the second Bank of the United States (BUS) and the successful Jacksonian assault on that institution beginning in 1832.  During the course of his narrative Hammond mercilessly shreds the shibboleths of liberal historians: poor and simple agrarians fought the moneyed elite through Andrew Jackson and his reforms; Nicolas Biddle was a conniving, flagitious political operator; the BUS was a corrupt, inefficient institution that fattened lazy aristocrats at the expense of the humble productive classes; the West was the primary source of hostility toward the BUS.  All nonsense, Hammond argues.<br /><br />Rather, Hammond's thesis is that the main Jacksonian enemies of the BUS - not one of whom was an agrarian, he points out - used Jeffersonian language merely as a pretext to eradicate an institution that was successfully stabilizing the national currency and thus thwarting their speculative business interests.  Although he acknowledges that residual agrarian hostility to banks and the resentment of states rights politicians to the intrusion of federal power through the BUS were contributing factors, Hammond argues that the primary impetus for destroying Biddle and the BUS was provided by a new and burgeoning group of business elite, primarily from New York.  Made up of ambitious entrepreneurs and local bankers, these new Jacksonians bridled at the regulatory influence the BUS had on restraining free credit.  Moreover, because the BUS collected all federal receipts, which at that time were mostly import duties on goods flowing through New York City, local New York banks could not profit from the lucrative trade their city supported.  They believed the use of that currency was rightfully theirs, and they resented the fact it was sent to a bank run out of Philadelphia and controlled by Philadelphians (and foreigners, or so many believed, but Hammond denies).<br /><br />Thus, Hammond concludes, the \\"Bank War\\" was really a fight between conservative, principled businessmen on the one side and reckless, \\"get rich quick\\" speculators on the other.  He holds Nicholas Biddle up as second only to Alexander Hamilton for his contribution in creating the greatest economic engine the world has ever known: American capitalism.  Andrew Jackson, meanwhile, is disparaged as a well-meaning dolt whose supposed reforms did nothing to benefit the common man he professed to represent, but rather destroyed the most effective central banking system ever developed by the 1830s.through the BUS were contributing factors, Hammond argues that the primary impetus for destroying Biddle and the BUS was provided by a new and burgeoning group of business elite, primarily from New York.

Potter's classic \\"The Impending Crisis,\\" William Freehling's \\"Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Controversy in South Carolina, 1816-1836\\" is perhaps the best book written on antebellum America in the past 50 years. Originally published in 1965 and a recipient of the prestigious Bancroft Prize, Freehling's work is a beautifully written and persuasively argued case that the conventional wisdom about the nullification crisis of 1832 is grossly oversimplified and, in the end, fundamentally incorrect.<br /><br />Two points are central to Freehling's thesis: 1) growing anxiety over slavery and the nascent abolitionist movement - especially acute in the low country - was as important a factor in driving the aggressive states rights posture taken during the nullification crisis as was reaction to the tariff; and 2) South Carolinians themselves were as much to blame for their economic woes during the 1820s and 1830s as the \\"Tariff of Abominations.\\"<br /><br />Freehling notes that you can often tell a lot about a society by disproportionate reactions to perceived threats. In this case, the South Carolinian response to the first faint rumblings of abolitionist agitation was far in excess to the actual threat posed in the 1820s and early 30s, according to the author. However, the extremely dense slave population in the South Carolina low country (in some areas slaves out numbered whites 5 to 1), the experience of the Denmark Vesey conspiracy in 1822, the mysterious arsonist fires in Charleston, the constant presence of Yankee peddlers and free black British seamen mixing with the slave population, and the slow but ultimately successful abolition campaign of William Wilberforce in England all conspired to create an environment of fear and doom among the South Carolina gentry.<br /><br />The traditional interpretation of the tariff's adverse impact in South Carolina was that the local planters were forced to trade their raw goods (in this case cotton) on the international open market but buy their end goods in a protected domestic market. Freehling concedes that there is some basis of truth to this claim, but only for a certain segment of the population. Some of the most ardent nullifiers were low country rice planters whose economic condition was relatively unaffected by the tariff and whose prices remained stable. The issue that welded the low country elite to an issue whose consequences were really absorbed by the up country was (in addition to inter marriage, school days at South Carolina College, etc.) the latter's growing fear of the abolitionists. Moreover, Freehling argues, gross absentee mismanagement of plantations, combined with a poor state financial infrastructure and a penchant to dramatically overspend for luxury items (the much needed specie often flowing outside of the state) were nearly as important in explaining the economic depression that gripped the region for over a decade as the tariff.<br /><br />Freehling makes his case eloquently and convincingly. For those with a serious interest in early 19th century American history - especially those interested in economic development, states rights doctrine, or the impact of abolitionism - this book cannot be more highly recommended.international open market but buy their end goods in a protected domestic market.

Unlike other revolutionary advances in science, such as nuclear energy, where the threats to society if the technology were abused or unregulated were obvious from the outset, biotechnology's greatest threat is that on the surface it seems rather benign.<br />From this starting point Fukuyama addresses three distinct but related topics: 1) an overview of the biotech revolution; 2) the relationship between the biotech revolution and classical political philosophy; and 3) an outline of possible policy responses. From this reader's perspective, the first section was fascinating, the second dull, and the third necessary but dry.<br />In short, 'Our Post Human Future' provides a great primer on the biotech revolution and convincingly lays out the potential social and political impact of those advances. Those familiar with the subject will likely find nothing new and may be disappointed. However, for those will little background in bio-technology but who enjoy pondering 'the long view' or thoughtfully engaging in policy debates, 'Our Post Human Future' will be of great interest, and will likely leave you pondering questions you'd never considered before.	2002-08-02

Not an attack on the \\"conservative\\" position on this or that topic, mind you.  Rather, he argues that there is some sort of innate dark side in America - the conservatives - that has consistently and relentlessly tried to deprive society of freedom and liberty at every turn.<br />Schlesinger twists and bends and stretches American history in his attempt to show how the national saving grace of liberalism has continued in one uninterrupted line from Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln to Wilson and, finally, to FDR, even though the issues, parties and arguments have changed radically.  (Had this book been published in the late- rather the mid-twentieth century, I'm sure the author would have demonstrated the role Johnson, Carter and Clinton played in that continuum.)<br />Schlesinger saves his most impressive feat of historical casuistry for explaining how and why the Democratic Party wasn't \\"really\\" the political party of slavery and oppression.  By 1848, in Schlesinger's analysis, the two central parties, Democrat and Whig, existed in name only.  All the radical (read \\"truly liberal\\") elements of the Jacksonian tradition had joined the Republican Party by 1858 (conveniently allowing them to take credit for the Civil War and destroying American bondage), but were back in the Democratic Party by the time big business usurped the GOP during and after Reconstruction.<br />With such a contemptuous and sarcastic review, you might be wondering \\"so why the 4 stars\\"?<br />Well, it has been said that the field of economics progresses one funeral at a time - and I would argue the same holds true for the study of history.  Whatever this book's faults, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. is one of the most influential historians of the twentieth century and this book shaped the minds and ideas of a generation of liberal intellectuals, including senior Democratic statesmen.  For anyone interested in learning more about Jacksonian America and understanding one popular, albeit controversial, interpretation of its roots in modern American liberalism, this book is essential reading.f liberal intellectuals, including senior Democratic statesmen.

In this recent biography, Paul Nagel seeks to go beyond the historical negative image of our sixth president to uncover the man behind the mask.<br />Given the author's stated intention, this book is as much character analysis as historical biography.  Other reviewers of this book listed below have criticized Nagel for neglecting an in-depth accounting of JQA's public accomplishments.  Clearly, they didn't read the preface (in which the author clearly lays out the focus of the book) and would have been much better off reading a different volume on Adams' life, such as Samuel Flagg Bemis' masterwork, \\"John Quincy Adams and the Foundations of American Foreign Policy,\\" which won the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Biography and provides a comprehensive analysis of JQA's many public achievements.<br />Using JQA's private diary as the primary source, Nagel describes a talented but conflicted man tormented by a life of extreme self-doubt and merciless self-criticism.  From an early age JQA was groomed for greatness by his parents.  But that preparation - which included a stint as secretary to the US Minister to Russia while only 14 years old, the best classical education a young American of his time could dream of, and close contact with many heads of state and intellectuals - proved to be more curse than blessing in a nation rapidly shifting toward the popular democracy of Jacksonianism.  The intense pressure to succeed and a public increasingly hostile to his aristocratic upbringing and bearing caused JQA a lifetime of great personal anguish and ultimately national rejection.<br />For those interested in learning more about Adams' role as chief negotiator at Ghent during the War of 1812, his storied tenure as Monroe's secretary of state, his disastrous presidential administration, or his controversial career in the House in later life, there are much better volumes to read than Nagel's.  However, few biographies exceed Nagel's insight into Adams' personal life - his pettiness, self-pity, disappointment, and grief.there are much better volumes to read than Nagel's.

For Jackson, it was conspiracy of the wealthy elites against a commoner, and it proved that the American republic itself was in mortal jeopardy.  The defeat served as a catalyst for Jackson's passionate, almost obsessive commitment to \\"reform and retrenchment,\\" which Remini weaves together with the character developed in Volume I.  It was his quest to avenge the loss of 1824 (and the honor of the American people who had been swindled) and sweep the \\"augean stables\\" of corruption and graft in Washington that led to the great democratic movement that bears his name.  (It should be noted that Harry Ammon and other leading historians of the Monroe and Adams administrations stridently contest Remini's assertion that the Era of Good Feelings was actually the \\"Era of Corruption.\\")<br /><br />For those of you who puzzled over Washington's obsession with the Monica Lewinsky affair, you will be amused to read that the dominating issue of Jackson's first term was the reportedly lascivious nature of Peggy Eaton, the wife of Jackson's old friend and secretary of war.  This so-called \\"Petticoat War,\\" which saw the wives of other cabinet members and senior officials -- mostly notably vice president Calhoun's wife, Floride -- shunning social interaction with Peggy, literally ripped the cabinet asunder and very nearly toppled the government.

Remini &#34;our foremost Jacksonian scholar&#34;.  No matter how one feels about Remini's scholarship or historical interpretations, he is undeniably the most prolific Jacksonian historian of our time - our any other time, for that matter.<br /><br />In reading his celebrated three-volume biography of Andrew Jackson and other related works, I'd come to think of Remini as something of a &#34;Jackson bigot.&#34;  The reverence Remini has for Jackson practically oozes from the pages of his books, while the many injustices and dubious actions undertaken by the seventh president throughout his lifetime are treated as the unfortunate, but excusable episodes of a passionate and often impulsive man (some examples might include: the Treaty of Fort Jackson and other Indian treaties; the unauthorized invasion of Florida in 1818 and his conduct during that campaign; the forced removal of the Cherokees from Georgia; etc.).  Indeed, I have often thought that had Remini lived in Jackson's lifetime he may have supplanted Francis Blair as editor of the pro-Jackson newspaper, the Washington Globe.  Thus, given such an undisguised admiration for Jackson and his trenchant democratic principles, I was curious to see how Remini would treat his arch-villain: the indomitable Henry Clay of Kentucky.<br /><br />To my great surprise and pleasure, Remini presents an exceptionally balanced and thorough account of &#34;Prince Hal&#34; and his feud with Andrew Jackson and the Democrats as nominal head of the Whig party.  The author pays homage to Clay's tremendous oratorical and political abilities and openly laments the fact that Clay's overweening desire for the presidency ultimately deprived the nation of his services in that office.<br /><br />Clay's career in national pubic service was long and extraordinarily influential from start to finish.  Beginning in 1811, when he was sworn in as a freshman Congressmen, he was immediately elected Speaker of the House owing to his leadership position in a group of young, nationalistic and anti-British Republicans known as the &#34;War Hawks.&#34;  Remini credits Clay with single handedly changing the fundamental nature of the Speaker's position (which he held for longer than anyone in the 19th century), turning it from that of mundane legislative traffic cop to a leadership role of setting the political agenda and steering national policy.  Clay reveled in the rough-and-tumble nature of the House, where his quick wit and speaking abilities were distinct competitive advantages, and openly preferred it to the more rarified and sedate proceedings of the Senate.  And when circumstances ultimately brought Clay's talents to the US Senate, he again shaped that body in his own image, ushering in a period of great political debate that is still considered its &#34;golden era.&#34;<br /><br />In the end, Clay failed in his endeavor to shape national domestic policy to include federally funded internal improvements and, much to his chagrin and Remini's, he never had the opportunity to leave his imprint on the executive branch.  Nevertheless, as Remini's superb biography makes clear, the legislative branch was Henry Clay's domain, and during his remarkable career in that body (off and on from 1811 to 1852) he did more to refine and redefine the tone, process and importance of Congress than any other American statesman in history.position in a group of young, nationalistic and anti-British Republicans known as the &#34;War Hawks.&#34;  Remini credits Clay with single handedly changing the fundamental nature of the Speaker's position (which he held for longer than anyone in the 19th century), turning it from that of mundane legislative traffic cop to a leadership role of setting the political agenda and steering national policy.

Yet, in this distinguished biography by Harry Ammon, first published in 1971, James Monroe emerges from the shadows of his good friends and fellow early Virginian presidents, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, to receive due credit for his significant contribution to the formation of the American republic.<br /><br />Some historians have criticized James Monroe as a man of modest talent who provided the country with feckless leadership during the crucial international, economic and political crises of his times - the collapse of the Spanish empire in the Western Hemisphere, the Panic of 1819, and the Missouri Compromise of 1820, respectively.  However, Ammon argues rather persuasively that these critiques are either unfair or overblown.  Monroe's conduct in the White House was guided by his deeply held republican principles, which maintained that executive power was subject to strict limitations.  To compare Monroe's leadership performance to that of 21st presidents is, in Ammon's opinion, supremely unjust.<br /><br />But even taking such thoughts into consideration, the truth is James Monroe was not a great man - and Ammon doesn't claim that he was.  He notes, for instance, that the correspondence between Jefferson and Madison covered a full range of intellectual topics, from philosophy and science to government and literature, whereas letters to Monroe kept strictly to practical political concerns.  Indeed, Ammon describes Monroe as a man of rather pedestrian abilities, but with a highly developed sense of republican principles and political drive who was much more instrumental in directing US policy than traditionally given credit for.<br /><br />If Monroe was a failure, it was in his ambitious attempt to restructure the American political system following the War of 1812.  Ammon maintains that the proposed reconciliation and amalgamation of the triumphant Republicans and crippled Federalists (the so-called &#34;Era of Good Feelings&#34;) was the primary objective of his administration, and in that endeavor Monroe failed utterly and completely.<br /><br />What is most striking in Ammon's narrative is Monroe's multifarious contribution to early American government: staff officer to Lord Stirling during the Revolution who was wounded in a gallant charge against the Hessians at Trenton and later suffered the privations of Valley Forge; delegate to the Constitutional Convention; United States senator; Republican minister to France during the Federalist administration of Washington; special envoy to Paris to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase; minister to England during the Jefferson administration; governor of Virginia; secretary of state during the Madison administration and then secretary of war during the War of 1812; and, finally, two-term president.  His lifelong commitment to public service, which left him financially destitute upon his retirement in 1825, is worthy of the sincere gratitude of posterity.<br /><br />Ammon is an able historian and this biography is a credit to subject and author alike.  At 573 pages, however, it is a rather dense tome and the casual reader should stay away.  But for those interested in a serious review of an important character in early American history, Ammon's &#34;James Monroe: the Quest for National Identity&#34; is highly recommended.nciliation and amalgamation of the triumphant Republicans and crippled Federalists (the so-called &#34;Era of Good Feelings&#34;) was the primary objective of his administration, and in that endeavor Monroe failed utterly and completely.

Long before the expression \\"Manifest Destiny\\" ignited the expansionist and nationalist passions of Americans in the 1840s, Andrew Jackson fought single-handedly - and occasionally circumvented direct military orders, the Constitution, local judges, and officially recognized international treaties - to advance American territorial expansion along the southern border and promote the removal of the Spanish, British and myriad tribes of native Americans.<br />Other salient events that Remini chronicles in this volume include Jackson's humble roots and tragic childhood during the American Revolution in the Carolinas; his move westward to the Tennessee territory to start life anew as a lawyer; the \\"facts\\" behind Jackson's much-disputed relationship with his wife, Rachel; his entry into local politics and emergence as a militia leader; his military exploits against the Creeks, the British at the Battle of New Orleans and the Seminoles; and, of course, the many duels, fist-fights and other outlandish events of his early life that he somehow managed to survive.<br />Much of Volume I reads like a \\"wild west\\" novel, but Remini is careful to accentuate how Jackson's natural rough hewn character, along with his experience on the frontier, melded to shape a political philosophy that ultimately altered the course of American government. There is little direct reference to the principles that would become known as Jacksonian Democracy in this volume - an undying faith in the virtue and wisdom of the people, the inviolability of the Union, the pernicious effects of deficit spending and \\"soft\\" currency, etc. - but it is easy to understand how and why Jackson cherished those ideals after reading the story of his early life.<br />Finally, it must be noted that Remini assiduously avoids holding Jackson's conduct in relation to slavery and the Indians to modern standards. In all fairness, that is understandable and not especially offensive. However, Remini does neither himself nor Jackson any service by going out of his way to stress how relatively humane (in Remini's mind) the president was to his human chattel and explaining that he really had the Indians best interests at heart when he forced them from their land to the barren plains of modern day Oklahoma. In this volume and the others, Remini offers some strongly worded criticism of Jackson's political, military and social performance, but his many heinous crimes against humanity are treated with kid gloves throughout.f the Union, the pernicious effects of deficit spending and \\"soft\\" currency, etc. - but it is easy to understand how and why Jackson cherished those ideals after reading the story of his early life.<br />Finally, it must be noted that Remini assiduously avoids holding Jackson's conduct in relation to slavery and the Indians to modern standards.

Folsom's \\"The Myth of the Robber Barons\\" is the ultimate apologist's essay on the early industrialists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  In fact, the title of the book suggests that Folsom intends to overturn the negative verdict handed down by Matthew Josephson in his seminal piece \\"The Robber Barons\\"  (1934), although the author spends no time directly refuting Josephson's claims.<br /><br />Folsom's revisionist tone should not detract from the fact that the he lays out an extremely concise (134 pages) but compelling argument that traditional history texts have unfairly lumped all early industrialists together as market predators and sources of political corruption and social upheaval.  Folsom's thesis consists of two central points: 1) overall the early industrial captains did more good than harm because their efficiency brought a wide range of high quality, low cost goods to the average American consumer for the first time; and 2) what harm they did cause was more often than not a direct result of well-intentioned but poorly conceived and executed government market intervention.<br /><br />The first two chapters of this book on the development of the steamship and railroad industries, respectively, are far and away the most interesting and convincing.  Folsom uses these two industries to introduce his conception of the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" entrepreneur.  The former he labels \\"market entrepreneurs\\" who, he argues, succeed in business through technological innovation and production efficiency.  The latter he calls \\"political entrepreneurs,\\" which are marked by their use of governmental subsidies and protection that ultimately retards industrial development and keeps prices artificially high. Folsom presents Cornelius Vanderbilt and James J. Hill as the paragons of \\"market entrepreneurship\\" for their track records of operating extremely efficient, innovative and successful businesses against competitors who had the \\"benefit\\" of government subsidies and protection.<br /><br />Next, Folsom directly challenges this notion of federal subsidies as a benefit.  He argues that federal support, particularly in the case of building the first transcontinental railroad, often motivated inefficient behavior and was accompanied by requirements that further debilitated the recipients.  For example, Folsom maintains that the main form of subsidies for building the transcontinental railroad - land and loans per mile built - put a premium on speed of construction over quality.  The end result was a transcontinental line that was permanently saddled with high fixed costs owing to sloppy original construction and overpaying for necessary building materials.  Also, the nature of the federal support seemed to encourage graft and corruption, although Folsom concedes that the railroad executives deserve their share of culpability in events like the Credit Mobilier scandal.  Finally, as recipients of federal largesse, the railroads had to agree to ship US mail at reduced rates, which lowered existing revenue, procure American construction materials even if they were of a higher price and lower quality, which increased costs, and were not allowed to build crucial feeder lines without Congressional approval, which prevented new sources of revenue.  The end result, Folsom claims, was a vicious cycle:  federal aid tied to miles of road constructed led to construction inefficiency and political corruption; the inefficiency and corruption led to consumer wrath; consumer wrath led to government regulatory intervention; and the regulation closed options and pushed the roads into bankruptcy.<br /><br />Folsom's hypothesis is concise and neat -- perhaps too neat.  Some of the data Folsom uses to support his arguments are debatable.  For instance, to support his claim that uniform railroad rate regulation as laid down by the Hepburn Act seriously damaged US exports to Asia, particularly the market entrepreneur Jim Hill who never received any federal aid, Folsom cites the fact that US steel exports to Japan and China fell 40% between 1905 and 1907.  Of course, during that time period the Russo-Japanese War also went from its height, when Japan was presumably importing massive amounts of foreign steel in support of its war effort, to a peaceful conclusion.  Clearly then, much more influential forces than the Hepburn Act contributed to the fall in US exports over that time.  Whether this oversight was an act of omission or commission on the part of Folsom is unknowable.<br />Overall, while the scholarship of \\"The Myth of the Robber Barons\\" may leave a bit to be desired, the author's central thesis and main observations are compelling and should be considered with care.  If you are interested in viewpoints on American economic and industrial development, you'll want to read this book.s the fact that US steel exports to Japan and China fell 40% between 1905 and 1907.

That is how W.A. Swanberg's 1961 classic \\"Citizen Hearst\\" made me feel about William Randolph Hearst.  I can say that about no other biography I've ever read.<br />Indeed, the derogatory adjectives that apply directly to William Randolph Hearst are virtually inexhaustible: irresponsible, pampered, egotistical, hypocritical, lascivious, presumptuous, adulterous, rapacious, etc.  One searches in vain for admirable or redeeming qualities in Hearst.  Even supposed acts of benevolence and charity - which usually centered on the one thing that meant nothing to him, money - always seem to smack of insincerity and self-interest.  None of this, of course, is meant to detract from Swanberg's phenomenal account of the publisher's life, which is truly engrossing and highly recommended by this reader.<br />Hearst was born in the lap of luxury and never knew the value of a dollar earned by a day's work, yet for over half-a-century he fashioned himself the defender of the common man and was a leading voice in Progressive politics.  Far from creating a profitable media empire, Hearst's newspapers lost money at a staggering rate for well over a decade (Swanberg's account is frustrating in that he never clarifies exactly when Hearst's efforts turned profitable).  The simple secret of Heart's success was that his deceased father's mines could churn out precious metal at a faster pace than he could squander the profits on his newspapers and chasing the chimera of the presidency.  He took a mistress half his age when he was in his fifties and married with five children, and devoted all his immense energy and resources into making her the biggest film star in the world, despite her rather limited talent.  An early hero to the radical left, in old age he reversed course and emerged as one of the earliest and most virulent anti-communists and opponents of the progressive income tax - a measure he once championed.<br />Swanberg delivers this amazing life in an extremely fluid and engaging - indeed, exciting - narrative.  He notes that people have never been able to adequately explain William Randolph Hearst.  The instinct was - and still is - to use the world \\"great\\" when describing him, but great in what way?  Swanberg offers up his own conclusion: Hearst was the greatest loser of his generation.  Not exactly a flattering assessment, but nonetheless a very accurate one.  In the end, Hearst failed in business, in politics, in marriage, and in the movie business.  For better or worse, he left an indelible stamp on the American experience, and for that he should be remembered, if not exactly revered.as one of the earliest and most virulent anti-communists and opponents of the progressive income tax - a measure he once championed.<br />Swanberg delivers this amazing life in an extremely fluid and engaging - indeed, exciting - narrative.

In fact, it just may be the worst piece of historical writing I've ever come across.<br />This book was listed as \\"suggested reading\\" for a class I took on Moby Dick at Stanford University, which celebrated the 150th anniversary of that American classic.  In fairness to the professor, he cautioned that he had not read \\"Melville\\" himself and strongly recommended the lengthy two-volume biography by Hershel Parker for those seriously interested in the life and times of the author.  Relative brevity, it seems, is this book's only virtue.<br />Robertson-Lorant is a high school teacher and one can't help but wonder if one of her students actually wrote this book - and not a very talented one at that.  The writing is tendentious, the footnoting extremely sloppy, and the structure jagged and disjointed.  Not only is the style bad; the author also consistently manages to foul up some of the most basic details of American history, such as the roots of the term \\"Barnburner\\" and the circumstances behind the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, to name just a very few.<br />Undoubtedly, Herman Melville is one of the more interesting 19th century American novelists.  His early adventures traveling the world on a Navy ship and whaler is fascinating, and the story of his early success and fame with \\"Typee\\" and his long, slow decline into frustrating obscurity thereafter is poignant and tragic.  One thing is for certain: his life deserves better treatment than this.	2002-02-22

Morgan was not the wealthiest of the great early industrialists. That title went to John D. Rockefeller, Sr. Nor was the story of his rise to prominence in the business world the most improbable or remarkable. The young Charles Schwab Jr. would claim that prize, in my opinion. Finally, he did not leave the most lasting and influential legacy through grand-scale philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie was clearly the winner in that regard. Yet, Jean Strouse's wonderful biography \\"Morgan: Financier\\" makes one thing perfectly evident: J.P. Morgan was the single most powerful private citizen in America - perhaps the world - in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br />The scion of a powerful Connecticut banking family, J. Pierpont Morgan was the most uncommon of business specimens: a privileged and sheltered young man who grew up to advance the family business beyond the loftiest expectations of his industrious forbearers. During the course of his lifetime, the center of global finance shifted from London to New York and the United States emerged as the greatest industrial power on earth. While America's prodigious natural endowments and the industrious spirit of the nation were fundamental to those events, J.P. Morgan and his banking empire, the so-called House of Morgan, filled the critical role of financial steward that oversaw and managed that tremendous growth.<br />During the course of his fabulous career, J.P. Morgan played many roles critical to US economic development: investment banker, venture capitalist, management consultant, central banker, and labor dispute mediator. In his efforts to establish business harmony and eliminate mutually ruinous competition among railroads, Morgan frequently orchestrated massive corporate reorganizations, popularly known as \\"Morganizations,\\" of usually bankrupt lines. Debt would be rescheduled, the capital structure would be shifted from debt to equity, and new management would be brought in, leading to renewed investor confidence and rising stock prices of the Morganized line. Morgan's influence over capital also thrust him into an occasional political role, the most notable example being his role in mediating the anthracite coal strike of 1902 that averted an impending national calamity. Finally, and most importantly, Morgan served as the de-facto chairman of the Federal Reserve before that essential institution existed. In 1895 and again in 1907, Morgan leapt into the breach of a major financial panic and prevented a total collapse of the nation's economy by personally serving as the lender of last resort. Strouse chronicles these activities in a manner and style that is both fascinating and satisfying to the corporate finance amateur and Wall Street maven alike.<br />On balance, Strouse delivers an objective account of Morgan's personal and professional life, but it certainly skews toward the favorable. Morgan's role in responding to the great panic of 1907 is particularly interesting as a means to gauge the opinions of the author about her subject. She is unabashed in her support and paints all Morgan's actions in the most admirable light, ascribing only patriotic and selfless motivations to his activities over the course of the two-week event. That Morgan may have benefited in anyway from the destruction of the trust banks (that some argued took away business from him) or that US Steel may have scooped up Tennessee Iron & Coal at a premium (as the Stanley Commission of 1911 later claimed) are dismissed out of hand by Strouse. The charge that the whole panic was intentionally set by Morgan to destroy the trust banks but got out of their control is described as pure paranoia and entirely groundless. Nevertheless, Strouse doesn't shy away from pointing out Morgan's personal shortcomings, such as the hypocrisy of his outward devotion to the Episcopal Church and his well-known philandering. In all, \\"Morgan: Financier\\" is a remarkable work on a remarkable lifestor confidence and rising stock prices of the Morganized line.

After reading \\"Theodore Rex,\\" however, one wonders if another personal assessment from the time might have made for a more appropriate title: Henry Adams' comment that TR was \\"pure act.\\"<br />Theodore Roosevelt was certainly one of the most unique personalities ever to occupy the executive office.  The scion of a dignified Knickerbocker family, he was enamored of the uncouth ways of the Wild West and big game hunters.  A deeply cerebral and widely read Harvard graduate with dozens of publications to his credit, he reveled in physical combat, military glory and other exploits not often associated with intellectuals.  He was, in short, an American original.<br />Morris devotes this volume exclusively to TR's White House years (1901-1909).  Having read the first volume (\\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\") immediately before \\"Theodore Rex,\\" I was surprised at the subtle, yet palpable difference in the style each was written.  Where the first volume is extremely crisp and direct, the second tends to incorporate overly florid prose, as if Morris is consciously trying to make the biography read like a novel.  Make no mistake, however; the book is beautifully written and always engaging, if not occasionally melodramatic.<br />For a narrative of such prodigious length relative to the time period covered (550 pages for just under eight years of presidential history), Morris surprisingly failed to give due consideration to some central issues of the Roosevelt administration.  For instance, during the Panic of 1907, TR and his new secretary of the treasury, George Cortelyou, turned to J.P. Morgan and other Wall Street kingpins to help orchestrate a financial recovery.  The price for economic stability, Morgan and others claimed, was to allow the U.S. Steel trust to save a failing brokerage house, Moore & Schley, from ruin.  The remedy was to have U.S. Steel buy Tennessee Coal & Iron (TCI) from Moore & Schley (which the brokerage held as collateral for its loans) to provide the necessary liquidity to prevent default and further panic.  Before the deal was consummated, however, U.S. Steel wanted assurances from the Roosevelt White House that they wouldn't be prosecuted for monopoly behavior because of the strategic acquisition.  In Morris' telling of the story, TR agrees to the acquisition, the tide of panic is quickly stemmed and the economy recovers.  Yet, in other versions TR and Cortelyou were criticized for being duped by Wall Street interests and that the TCI acquisition was merely a ploy by Morgan and his steel trust to gain valuable property at bargain prices along with immunity from federal prosecution.  In fairness to Morris, this story may be told in great detail in the next volume, but if so he left no hints of foreshadowing in the present text and early criticism of the deal emerged before TR had left office.<br />Other reviewers of this book have claimed that Morris' account degenerates into something all too common in modern popular biography: hero worship.  I disagree.  Morris clearly maintains a healthy respect and admiration for TR and his political philosophy, but he is also quick to point out the president's weaknesses, such as his preening vanity, his instinct for political survival over personal loyalty, and, as his tenure in office came to a close, an increasing vindictiveness in his reaction to any and all opposition.  Nor does Morris hesitate to lay blame on Roosevelt for some of his notable failures, the most prominent example being his conduct in uniformly dismissing an entire unit of African-American soldiers from the Army on highly circumstantial evidence of complicity in initiating a race riot at Brownsville, TX.<br />In sum, Morris delivers a superbly written and balanced account of a sometimes outlandish, often inspiring and always entertaining chief executive.ometimes outlandish, often inspiring and always entertaining chief executive.	2002-02-13

Personally, I was drawn to this book because of its focus on that watershed year.  Most undergraduate courses use 1877 as the explicit demarcation point between early and modern American history.  Yet, I never quite understood why a plurality of professional historians had concluded that 1877 was the decisive inflection point in the history of our nation and hoped this book would shed some light on that issue.<br />In the main, this book deals with the rise of big business (railroads, in particular) and the subsequent emergence of unionism and ultimately labor violence.  That larger story is told through the specific events of the summer of 1877, when railroad workers reacted widely and violently - although not concertedly - to a wave of pay reductions by the major eastern trunk lines.  In essence, the railroad executives had formed a quasi &quot;union of capital,&quot; whereby each major trunk line agreed to lower wages by 15% one at a time throughout the summer and not to issue any rate wars in the interim while roads were putting down the inevitable strikes and walk-outs.<br />The most shocking aspect of Bruce's narrative is the level of violence committed on both sides and the extremely precarious state of the nation at that time, both economically and politically.  President Rutherford B. Hayes had come to office at the beginning of the year in a widely disputed election where he had secured a one electoral point victory over his Democratic challenger, New York Governor Samuel Tilden, but lost the popular vote and was ultimately declared the winner by an extra-governmental committee (sound familiar?).  Moreover, the nation was just beginning to recover from the Panic of 1873, the worst economic contraction in American history to the time, while the South still smoldered from Civil War and was on the verge of all-out racial warfare as Reconstructionist policies were imposed from Washington.  In short, the crisis facing the country was severe and it is a testament to the remarkable resilience of our republic that it survived such a widespread spasm of violence so shortly after a civil war, in the midst of extreme economic hardship, and under the leadership of a new, disputed and largely uninspiring chief executive.<br />Bruce's writing style is crisp and direct, as one might expect to find in a book written by an academic in the 1950s.  He avoids the showy dramatization common in contemporary popular history, but also steers clear of the dry, didactic prose of &quot;more professional&quot; histories.  Those seeking a light, inspiring book to breeze through will likely be disappointed; however, those interested in getting a better understanding of a crucial, yet mostly forgotten epoch of American history will be satisfied and rewarded.s were imposed from Washington.

Ron Chernow's \\"Titan\\" is more than a great business biography; it is one of the best biographies I've ever read.  Although Standard Oil and the rise of big business in America clearly play a central role, this book is first and foremost about John D. Rockefeller: his convictions, his character, his relationship with family, friends and colleagues.<br />And what an interesting man he was.  To put it mildly, Rockefeller was a contradiction in terms.  On the one hand, he was a sincerely pious man, deeply committed to the Baptist church and a paragon of personal morality and virtue.  Yet, on the other hand, he was as ruthless - and successful - a corporate executive as has ever been produced in American history, more than willing to personally ruin competitors with bankruptcy to further his personal aims.  Chernow makes this contradiction the focal point of his biography, and succeeds brilliantly in capturing and analyzing how Rockefeller balanced his devout Christianity with his cutthroat business practices.  He argues that Rockefeller was able to do this by ascribing his business success to the will of God, which later fueled his famous works of philanthropy in the early the 20th century.<br />After reading \\"Titan,\\" one can't help but wonder if Rockefeller did, in fact, take advantage of some sort of divine intervention at various stages of his career.  For instance, when the northwest Pennsylvania oil fields began to show signs of exhaustion, threatening the future of the domestic oil business, new deposits were discovered in Ohio that favored Rockefeller and his empire.  And just as electricity began to show signs of popular adoption, threatening to ruin the kerosene illuminant market that Standard Oil had dominated, the automobile emerged on the scene, which used the theretofore noxious byproduct of kerosene production, gasoline, to operate and expanded the oil business beyond anyone's wildest dreams.<br />At each step of the way, from the early days as an inconspicuous refinery in Cleveland to the global leviathan battling government intervention, public animosity, and foreign competition, Rockefeller skillfully guided the corporation with the foresight and tenacity of a great statesman.  Chernow brings his story to life with such vitality and honesty that both Rockefeller and his nemesis, Ida Tarbell, would likely endorse it.e way, from the early days as an inconspicuous refinery in Cleveland to the global leviathan battling government intervention, public animosity, and foreign competition, Rockefeller skillfully guided the corporation with the foresight and tenacity of a great statesman.

In telling the story the author skillfully bridges fifty years of American history, from the agrarian, inward-looking communities of Jacksonian America to the dawn of American industrialism and expansion of the Gilded Age.<br />In tracing the evolution of the dream to build a transcontinental railroad from conception to completion in a single volume narrative history, Bain tackles a subject nearly as daunting as the original project itself.  The cast of characters involved were many and diverse: Asa Whitney, Ted Judah, the &quot;Big Four,&quot; the Ames brothers, Charles Durant, Grenville Dodge, several US presidents and cabinet officials, a slew of state and local leaders, not to mention the numerous mid-level railroad managers that actually turned the dream into reality.  Weaving this wide array of participants and events into one seamless story is challenging, to say the least, but the author proves worthy of the task.<br />Bain is not a historian by training, but rather a former journalist currently serving as professor of literature at Middlebury College (VT).  Thus, his writing has a certain literary quality and tends to eschew the bland prose common in more academic pieces, which could have made this book all but unbearable.  However, it must be noted that the author isn't entirely successful in bringing order to the chaos.  One can easily become confused as new players constantly emerge in the storyline while others quietly fade away.  This cycle is repeated often, leaving the reader to thumb back to re-read certain sections again for clarity.<br />Finally, a modern American reader of &quot;Empire Express&quot; can't help but be shocked at the malfeasance attending the construction of the transcontinental railroad, not to mention the blatant conflict of interest prevalent throughout.  For instance, Leland Stanford served as President of the Central Pacific and Governor of California simultaneously, pushing through legislation favorable to his company in the process.  Meanwhile, the Union Pacific's Oakes Ames served as a US Congressional Representative with influence on federal railroad policy during construction of the road.  Taken altogether, the present day pseudo-scandal surrounding Enron looks positively benign in comparison.but be shocked at the malfeasance attending the construction of the transcontinental railroad, not to mention the blatant conflict of interest prevalent throughout.

Born into a politically active although socio-economically humble family in Scotland, Carnegie possessed a passion for advancement and material wealth that propelled him to the forefront of the industrial world. Rising from Pittsburgh telegraph message boy to protege of Pennsylvania Railroad executive Tom Scott to capitalist investor and finally steel magnate in a decade-and-a-half, Carnegie was the very embodiment of the Horatio Alger hero popularized at that time.<br /><br />Although he shared the same business philosophy of using retained earnings for growth rather than dividends as John D. Rockefeller and other titans and he exhibited a personal drive and sense of destiny common to other leading trust-builders, Carnegie was in one particular way very different from his peers. He was a deeply cerebral man, very well-read and able to compose thoughtful essays on some of the most pressing and challenging political and economic issues of his time. His written defense of the gold standard was used by Mark Hanna to promote McKinley's stance against the bi-metallism of William Jennings Bryan in the crucial 1896 election; his thoughts on central banking influenced Wilson's policies in creating the Federal Reserve System; and Carnegie was one of the very first argue for a permanent League of Nations to work for arbitration of international disputes. His close personal friends were British liberals, renowned philosophers such as Herbert Spencer and other members of the intellectual elite on both sides of the Atlantic, not fellow industrialists or business associates like Henry Clay Frick or Henry Phipps who cared little for politics and even less for the recondite subjects that intrigued Carnegie.<br /><br />Wall weaves these diverse cords of Carnegie's life into a masterful biography that succeeds as much as a social, political and business history of his time as it does in critically examining the complex character, beliefs, and relationships of an extraordinary man. Wall is certainly sympathetic to Carnegie and his achievements, but overall &#34;Andrew Carnegie&#34; is extremely objective and the author doesn't hesitate to highlight his subject's personal foibles, convenient lapses of memory, and vanity.<br /><br />At over one thousand pages in length the paperback is physically imposing and can at times bog down in detail, but Wall's lucid writing style and often sardonic wit make it a fast and enjoyable read.not fellow industrialists or business associates like Henry Clay Frick or Henry Phipps who cared little for politics and even less for the recondite subjects that intrigued Carnegie.

US	49916018	R3L5LL70T543NT	0801857716	307173846	The Life and Legend of Jay Gould	Books	2	29	32	N	N	A Valentine for Jay Gould	In the \\"Life and Legend of Jay Gould,\\" historian Maury Klein seeks to resurrect the image of the archetypal -- but now largely forgotten -- early American industrialist.<br /><br />The names Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan are familiar to nearly everyone, and in this 497-page biography Klein makes a convincing case that Jay Gould belongs in that pantheon of early American business giants. From his early maneuvers (which Klein claims permanently undermined his reputation) in fighting for control of the Erie Railroad and an attempt to corner the gold market, to his Herculean efforts to build and maintain a vast transportation and communications empire in the face of brutal competition and economic and political chaos, Gould emerges as a true pioneer in American corporate finance. Moreover, perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, Jay Gould was the personification of the so-called \\"robber baron\\"; the man and the myth were consummate.<br /><br />Yet, for all of its promise, this book is a huge disappointment. Klein is a classically trained historian and accomplished professional academic, yet this book reads as if it were composed by a fawning amateur.  A project that began as an effort to \\"set the record straight,\\" ultimately degenerates into a frustratingly air-brushed portrait of a very complex and capable man. Rather than a balanced and objective review of Gould's character and business acumen, the book takes on the form of a giddy valentine. Seemingly every move Gould makes is judged by Klein as \\"brilliant, masterful and unexpected,\\" while his long list of formidable rivals are portrayed as bumbling morons. For example, after Gould ascended to a leadership position in the Union Pacific railroad, he moved to thwart the ruinous rate wars in transcontinental shipping that had erupted with the Pacific Mail steamship company, the Union Pacific's sole competitor in that market at that time. Shortly thereafter the Panama Railroad, the critical nexus upon which all of Pacific Mail's business depended, was acquired by another speculator and the transit contract with Pacific Mail abrogated. Klein describes Gould's actions in acquiring Pacific Mail and in getting out of the Panama railroad jam in glowing terms, but not a word is said about how someone with his supposed perspicacity could leave such a obviously vulnerable flank exposed in the first place.<br /><br />Also, the author almost totally neglects Gould's private life. Early in the book Klein confidently pronounces that \\"Two concerns dominated the rest of Gould's life, business and devotion to family.\\" Yet, from that point forward, nary a word is spoken about Gould's relationship with his wife and family -- or specifically about his relationship with the son whose incapable hands the family fortune would be left to and squandered. In comparison to Ron Chernow's and Jean Strause's treatment of the private lives of John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, respectively, in recent biographies, Klein's performance in this regard is particularly disappointing.<br /><br />In closing, two things are clear after reading \\"The Life and Legend of Jay Gould\\": 1) Jay Gould was a giant of American business, easily on par with Rockefeller and Carnegie; and 2) the definitive one-volume biography of his amazing life has yet to be written.ific Mail's business depended, was acquired by another speculator and the transit contract with Pacific Mail abrogated.
